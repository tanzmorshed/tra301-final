"fearthemcneil","10","421","477","4 January 2020"," I lived a version of this movie, and it hurt.
","I didn't expect this to mirror how my ex wife and I had to go through the stages of divorce so accurately. My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It's real and powerful."

","With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn't want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what's been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud.<br/><br/>What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can't be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie's childhood, but Nicole's family and home are something that's right in the middle of everything. There's also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry's upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly.<br/><br/>The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie's behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. ""Love doesn't make sense"", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year's awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole's divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014's 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For'), makes you wonder where he's been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother don't get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief.<br/><br/>Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008's 'Leatherheads') - masterful!<br/><br/>Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. No cheek will be left dry."
"MartinHafer","9","330","444","3 November 2019"," Incredibly depressing...but with some AMAZING performances and a great script.
","If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching ""Marriage Story"". I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.<br/><br/>The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!<br/><br/>Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way...and one of the better movies of 2019."
"mc1382","8","382","519","14 November 2019"," I don't know what to say
","This hit way too close to home, it was almost surreal how much the film mirrorred my own life. My parents recently went through a divorce and the way Nicole and Charlie's proceedings played out was almost too much to handle. It was almost too confronting, too emotionally gut punching, too real that I almost starting balling my eyes out in the theatre.<br/><br/>It's like this movie came at the right time and in the right moment. Just when I needed it most. This week for me hasn't been the best, a lot of things have been overwhelming for me. The film in a weird way, despite all the events devolving in chaos, told me that things are sometimes awful, unpredictable and emotionally draining but that's ok. The performances, direction, script all came together to deliver something that will always be special to me.<br/><br/>This film does have flaws, yes, but I don't really care, films like this only come once in a lifetime. Sometimes emotions mean more than cold hard criticism. I didn't expect this film to hit as hard as it did, godammit, just go see it already."
"madmax13-212-469405","10","293","407","27 December 2019"," You gotta side with Charlie
","Firstly you need to see this very realistic and just... incredible performance. To just watch the scenes without any context would be worth it. However.<br/><br/>The thing that I don't quite understand is how all the promotional things says that you never side with one or the other. Constantly fluctuating between the two. That was not the case in this movie at all. I found myself constantly siding with Charlie. His wife who lied, manipulated and tried to bankrupt him goes between confused to pure villainy. And when Charlie after quite a long time eventually fires back to keep his child she acts shocked and hurt. When she has dragged him through hell and back while constantly lying about wanting to do things without lawyers or that it's just a formality. But even if you, as I do pick one side. And stick with it for the entire film. It is incredible to watch and worth every second."
"Dello_","9","28","35","7 February 2020"," Human and delicate
","""Marriage Story"" is a film about a couple which is going trough the phases of a divorce. The best thing about this movie is that the characters, the two protagonists in particular, have a very human taste and they seem like real people feeling real emotions. And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect ""Marriage Story"" manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.
""Marriage Story"" is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score: check this one out!"

","I was glad to catch this film at the Virginia Film Festival last weekend. Baumbach's semi-autobiographical film offers a realistic glimpse into a divorce. His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent. Apart from the powerful performances by Driver and Johansson, the audience is able to find depth within each of the supporting characters."

"markgorman","9","139","217","25 November 2019"," A beautifully poignant essay on divorce with stand out performances amongst all the leads.
","The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.<br/><br/>In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.<br/><br/>It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.<br/><br/>In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.<br/><br/>That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.<br/><br/>It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.<br/><br/>But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.<br/><br/>But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.<br/><br/>Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.<br/><br/>Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.<br/><br/>Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.<br/><br/>It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema."
"loonatwok","8","17","22","5 February 2020"," Great performances in this real life movie
","It's a real life paced film with solid oscar worthy performances by Driver, Johansson, and Dern.<br/><br/>It may not hit home for those that haven't lived or seen loved ones go through divorce, but it's well worth a watch."
"leeisnotmyname","6","146","234","17 January 2020"," ""Divorce Story"" would be a more accurate title...
","...except no one would want to watch that title because it sounds so depressing.<br/><br/>The acting is incredible and deserving of every awards nomination out there. The performances are nuanced, truthful, and deeply honest about the humanity of the characters. The writing does a great job of making the viewer sympathize with both the wife and the husband; each is portrayed by turns as both the villain and the victim, so ultimately both are merely human. The ending, while to me unsatisfying overall, did leave a glimmer of hope that the divorced characters will somehow learn to be friends and make this awkward, fractured-family thing work.<br/><br/>However, be warned the whole movie is VERY depressing! I was disappointed that neither character grows or changes from their journey in any significant way. They both end the film just as self-centered and self-serving as they were at the beginning. This is not really a ""marriage story"". A marriage story would have its characters learn some things about commitment and compromise and self-sacrifice for the love of their family. They might learn how to actually work through their issues. But the title is misleading: this is really a divorce story, albeit an honestly-written, exquisitely-acted one, but ultimately a sad, shallow view of marriage.<br/><br/>Best Acting? Absolutely. But Best Picture?? No way."

"austinbmoney","6","224","370","13 December 2019"," Not as emotional as I thought it would be
","When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it."
"coonyp","8","20","27","23 January 2020"," A Interesting Comment on American Divorce
","Although every story is individual, the film captures a couple of important general realities about the state of modern divorce:<br/><br/>1) Many divorces shouldn't happen and that includes this divorce as it was portrayed.<br/><br/>The couple had plenty of regard for each other which was demonstrated in several portrayed interactions between them. The divorce appears to be mostly motivated by their differing professional aspirations. No matter how justified these may have been, in my moral judgment they should have been secondary to providing a stable home for their child. Perhaps the saddest aspect of our modern society is that many of us fail to realize that life is best experienced by subjugating our own needs to those around us, most particularly within our immediate family and even more particularly to our minor children. This form of narcissism seems more prevalent in show business where successful careers depend on self promotion and that may explain why people in that occupation appear to divorce at a higher rate.<br/><br/>2) Our legal system exacerbates the divorce experience for those who have assets<br/><br/>In most cases at the time that the decision to divorce is made, the ensuing pain is underestimated by the couple. Rather than the anticipated experience of freedom and removal of a burden, the loss of companionship causes considerable pain and grief which is most often redirected as anger toward the other spouse. If the couple have assets and hire attorneys, it is in the financial interest of the legal professionals who are billing hourly to take advantage of this acrimony. Many family law lawyers are like the Alan Alda character in the film and do their best to address the emotional needs of their clients despite this financial reality but there are others who do not. Too often divorces cause huge financial pain for both parties."
"nubz14","4","180","298","11 December 2019"," ""Marriage Story"" is mostly a tonally imbalanced fake-out.
","I was repeatedly embarrassed while watching Marriage Story.<br/><br/>The wild tonal shifts (the consistent insistence on sitcom-level farce/borderline slapstick - perhaps especially pre-serving the papers) repeatedly derailed my ability to take anything or anyone seriously. The theatre troupe scenes were terrible (""A four-time Oscar-winner was sucking my-"" why is this sequence/character in this film?). The abundance of overwritten monologuing. The cloying and contrived reappearance of the letter. Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson, who overall fares better than Driver) big ""It's a game I'm playing with myself!"" moment at the poolside. Their *big fight* (which made me snicker with how phony and forced it was, then appalled by the pseudo-disturbing revelation from Driver). Ordering his lunch for him at the lawyers' meeting, then tying his shoe for him. Pukey, honestly.<br/><br/>I'm shocked by the film, and the almost universally positive reactions, especially as this is from the same artist who made one of the great films about an ugly divorce: The Squid and the Whale.<br/><br/>There are moments and sequences that work, and even work very well, and some of the acting has special moments of high quality work (from Laura Dern and Alan Alda, especially), but the film as a whole doesn't work at all. I was especially stricken by a scene from the film's shamelessly manipulative second half, as it seems to best reflect a repeated problem with several sequences. It comes when Charlie (Adam Driver) gets up to sing Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" in front of his troupe, then goes to sit down after some awkwardness and mild friendly praise, but then inexplicably stands again and sings more - the rest of the song, in fact - and the film wants so desperately for this sequence to be telling and revelatory, and yet it moves from what starts to approach camp before stumbling into a desperate reach for his character's (clunky) pained lament(s). It's painful, yes, but not as intended, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>No one felt like a real person to me. No one talks like these characters talk.<br/><br/>The biggest cinematic surprise of the year for me was just how silly this turned out to be.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"
"mamc82-893-487892","5","376","642","11 December 2019"," A movie that will make you cringe in all the worst ways
","I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what's best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson).<br/><br/>Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole's own admission that she was miserable in L.A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own.<br/><br/>In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an ""affair"" Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L.A.<br/><br/>Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don't want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L.A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L.A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L.A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L.A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can't afford to fight for custody in L.A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L.A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can't work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can't see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. ""He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it"".<br/><br/>This was all done before Charlie even knows what's coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what's best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole's family. In fact, it's the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. ""You have to take a side"" she tells her mom. ""You can't have a relationship with Charlie anymore"" under any circumstances. Why? Because, it's about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery.<br/><br/>As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn't deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625,000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole's rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L.A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life's work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole's dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won't see his child.<br/><br/>While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole's character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists."
"dvcasson","7","31","45","20 January 2020"," A cautionary tale for men thinking about marriage
","This was hard to watch-- depressing and frankly the sort of scary that's so real and implacable it makes you queasy. For the most part, I'd rather not watch movies like this. But my wife popped it on and I didn't want to stop watching the trainwreck as it unfolded on the screen in front of me.<br/><br/>Only a few people caught what I did (or everyone is just being polite and ""not going there""): Adam Driver's character, Charlie, gets savaged by his outgoing wife, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), at least at first. Spoiler: works out relatively peacefully at the end. But only after Nicole makes a stunning show of force to Charlie via the support conferred upon her and all women by the state: she makes it crystal clear to Charlie, and to all us stupid, bad men, by extension, that we but serve at the Queen's pleasure, however petty, brutal, changeable, and self-referential her rule may be. Thankfully, Charlie was not bankrupted, destroyed as a person, or permanently deprived of his child but only because Nicole lacks, constitutionally, the fortitude to follow through on ANY life choice, be it marriage, lifelong career aspirations, or divorce. In other words, if Nicole hadn't been such a shameless coward, the second half of ""Marriage Story"" would only have detailed Charlie's abject evisceration on the floor of a family court room, with even his son cheering his annihilation. He wouldn't have been able to stop her.<br/><br/>The few reviewers who saw this dimension of the story expressed the view that the filmmakers must have wanted the audience to sympathize with Nicole and not Charlie. I disagree. I suspect the filmmakers rather sided with Charlie in terms of his much greater legal vulnerability compared to Nicole's. Why else belabor the point? Of course, we want the narrative to strongly denounce its villains, but that is not possible here, not in our thoroughly gynocentric world. The point had to be made in a subtle and understated way to make it to the big screen. That doesn't make it any less painful to watch, but hopefully some younger men who may be considering marriage will watch this movie and heed its implicit warnings about the overwhelming social and legal power of women in our social order. Charlie felt he was treated like a criminal and all it took was his wife basically calling him one. If you have ears to hear, then listen...<br/><br/>In short, hard to watch and very sad, but a good reminder for those of us married men who have already red-pilled to remember the risk we accepted when we married and, perhaps optimistically, a strong hint to single men to be aware of the shadow side of married life and their relationships with women in general that society tends to hide from them."
"ethanbresnett","9","17","23","8 March 2020"," Intimate and heartbreaking
","A truly beautiful film with two outstanding performances from Driver and Johansson. Detailing the increasingly fraught divorce proceedings of the couple, Marriage Story provides an intimate insight into their lives and their attempts to create some semblance of normality for the sake of their son.<br/><br/>The real standout of Marriage Story is the performances. Driver and Johansson were fully deserving of their Oscar nominations, both putting in some of their best performances. I felt every emotion alongside the pair of them, finding the pain and anger that each of them expressed to be so incredibly real and believable. Alongside these two powerhouse performances comes a superb supporting cast, particularly Nicole's family who provided some delightful comic relief.<br/><br/>This comedic element is another triumph of the film. It escaped being a very sombre film through its clever and subtle comedy, which added another layer to the film and further highlights the talent of Driver and Johansson in creating such light and dark in their work.<br/><br/>What also struck me about Marriage Story were the constant close camera angles which delivered a connection to the characters and enhanced the intimate feel of the experience. This really drew me in and, alongside the solid script and outstanding performances, made me connected to the film and engaged in a way I hadn't anticipated.<br/><br/>Everything about Marriage Story felt so real.

","I saw Marriage Story the day it came out on Netflix back in December, and I loved it. Now, almost two months later and after rewatching it, I love it even more.<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are absolutely fantastic in their roles. I think this is the best that both of them have ever been, and that's saying something. I don't think either of them will win the Oscar for their performance, but that doesn't take anything away from how great they are in this film. Speaking of Oscars, I will be shocked if Laura Dern doesn't win Best Supporting Actress for her role in Marriage Story, because she stole every single scene she was in and her performance was mesmerising.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a heartbreaking film about two people who's relationship has broken down, but it is told in a compelling way and I felt for both of them. The film does a great job at showing the audience the reasons why these two people fell in love, and also why it didn't work out in the long run. At the end of the day, these are two characters who are trying to do the best thing for their son, and it can be heartbreaking to watch at times.<br/><br/>The musical score was beautiful because it added to the emotion that we were feeling, and this made many of the scenes even more impactful. Marriage Story also contains the best-acted scene from the past few years, and I was transfixed to the screen the entire time. It's the argument in the third act, and I'm sure you know what I am referring to if you have seen the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't have a single complaint about Marriage Story. It is an absolute masterpiece, and easily the best film that Noah Baumbach has ever given us.<br/><br/>SCORE: 100%"

That everyone makes mistakes and often times there is just no right or wrong and you have to go with it anyway.<br/><br/>The cinematography and script was beautiful and very fitting. It made me pause to discuss certain topics and even made me cry in the end because in those two hours you get to know the couple and can relate to the both of them.

","A 93/100 metacritic score? Why?
I saw this movie yesterday, thinking that it was going to be a masterpiece. After half an hour, I noticed that I didn't care for the characters. The story, if you can call it a story, just dragged on from there. It's not really a story; it's more 'look at the struggle these 2 people go through'. This movie has every sign of a vanity project. There is loads of talent, but very little to work with.

"edvin-nordman","9","10","13","12 February 2020"," A depressing yet optimistic masterpiece
","I started watching this movie with very high expectations as it had recieved quite a lot of praise as well as several nominations and winning best supporting actress. I can safely say that it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>It begins with the main characters, portrayed by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, reading what they love about each other. It creates a false sense of security which is destroyed moments after. Even though you never see them when they truly loved each other, you still yearn for them to forgive and end the separation. You can never take any side in this story as it is clear that both characters are very gray in their morality, and definitely not good/evil. You also feel like this is most certainly something that could've happened.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, which was most expected of actors such as Adam Driver, Scarlet Johansson and Laura Dernn, yet I feel like some characters could've gotten more exploring. Adam Driver's character has two lawyers, one which suddenly disappears after a more or less minor argument with Driver and the other is very black and white in the sense that he seems like a deceitful, quite evil and greedy person. This is a shame but also understandeable since you can't delve deep into all the characters.<br/><br/>In the end the movie kept me captivated the entire time with hope and when it ended I felt better and, of course, a little depressed. This is most certainly one of the best movies of 2019. A must-see."

","Charlie and Nicole (Driver and Johansson) are a thirty-something, director-actor, couple with a young son. Charlie is a NY lover, Nicole is from LA and allegedly put her movie career on hold when she moved to NY to work for hubby Charlie's theatrical productions.<br/><br/>The couple is going through a rough patch, when after ten years in NY, Nicole receives an offer to star in a TV pilot and moves back to LA, with her mum and sister, bringing son Henry with her. Nicole wants a divorce ASAP, while Charlie still thinks they are getting back together and does not catch the drift until he is served papers.<br/><br/>Enter divorce lawyers, in the shape of obnoxious Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), working for Nicole, while Charlie hires - in succession - two lawyers with different degrees of aggressiveness (and hourly fees).<br/><br/>What we have here is two highly narcissistic people, who want to pursue their careers and find that family gets in their way. Nicole wants to do more than acting, but Charlie never allowed her to direct. With divorce comes the freedom to do so, because what the world needs is yet another director - what a shame would have been for humankind if Nicole missed her chance.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Charlie, described as self-involved, seems quite lethargic in most situations, especially when spending ""quality time"" with brat - I mean, beloved son - Henry. That kid freaked me out, he looks a lot like the one in The Shining.<br/><br/>Johansson gets lots of monologues, which seem to go on forever. Driver, an actor whose appeal always escaped me, gives another sleepwalking performance. Dern is OTT aggressive, the stereotype lawyer you love to hate. Julie Hagerty, as Nicole's mother plays borderline crazy and she's as annoying as most of the main cast. It does not help that both Nicole (with mummy) and Charlie break into cringe-worth long songs, stretching the running time over 2 hours.

This is one of the best performances by Scarlett and Adam Driver was amazing too.
I guess Scarlett would've highly related to the script because she had several divorces in the past, so she knows how it feels during that phase, the heartbreak, the excruciating mental trauma you go through and that can be seen in her performance. She's so natural in the emotional and verbal fight scenes.

There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson's mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides.<br/><br/>The film's emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film's lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm.<br/><br/>Usually, Baumbach's filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It's not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it's still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended."

Also Laura Dern's character was totally unprofessional in her snuggling with a prospective client. The opposing shark was more realistic but highly exaggerated.<br/><br/>Finally there is law which sets which state has jurisdiction over the issue of child custody. It would have been New York.

Nicole want out and is not the slightest bit interested in trying to save her fading marriage even though it seemed quite obvious to me that the couple still were attracted and somewhat affectionate to each other.<br/><br/>Then we have Adam Driver as the husband Charlie who strayed once according to Nicole ,although this is never really established it just seems that Nicole thinks she's invisible to him and not valued while it's clear if it wasn't for Charlie's success as a stage director she wouldn't have a stage career at all.<br/><br/>Why am I even trying to explain 2 hours 17minutes of a tedious couple screaming ,yelling and outdoing each other's accusations and revisiting each bump and grind in their tedious relationship. I felt so sorry for their young son Henry and hope his Dad got custody.<br/><br/>The acting is good especially Laura Dean as Nora Fanshaw the self interested crass Hollywood divorce lawyer who encourages Nicole to go for broke and Ray Liotta as Jay Marotta the even more greedy New York lawyer Charlie ,who never wanted to go through court and nasty legal battles engages on his behalf when his wife decides the opposite.<br/><br/>Another Netflix one month Cinema release the film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29 2019 and began a limited theatrical release on November 6 and exactly one month later December 6 (to qualify for Awards season) began digital streaming on Netflix to great critical acclaim but not from me .<br/><br/>I much prefer a far better film on the subject of a marriage breakup the brilliant 1979 Kramer Vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep it had style substance and two much more interesting characters than Marriage Story and told their story in 1hour and 45 minutes."

","I really had high hopes for this movie, since it had promising star power and an intriguing storyline. But it's apparent that most of this budget went into casting. Ten minutes deep, I was already cringing. The whole movie felt more like a stage production with overlong scenes, too much talking (spoon-feeding), and dramatic (though granted, not terribly delivered) monologues. It promises you a serious insight into a divorce between two good, well-meaning people, but its attempts at comedy fell flat and were hard to watch. Particularly with that over-acting, trying-too-hard performance by Merrit Wever, who came off as more of a cartoonish stage actress and whose character was more of a caricature.<br/><br/>There were also lines that were just bad and poorly delivered. Like one toward the start of the film where the babysitter says to them upon their return home ""God, you guys are so attractive."" What? Nobody talks like that in that context. Little things like that make one wonder if the writer/director even bothered to get any second opinions.<br/><br/>Driver and Johansenn did most of the heavy-lifting acting-wise, which gives us small windows of hope, but even so, their on-screen chemistry seemed forged and unnatural.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie came off as more of a vanity project than anything else.

Whether Nicole and Charlie belong in the latter category or the former, is for each viewer to decide for themselves. Noah Baumbach, for his part, does a good job of presenting both points of view and never standing in judgment. Undoubtedly this is a film that will hit some harder than others but if you have a pulse, you will not come out of this experience unmoved. The only issue I have with the film is that some of the comic scenes mess with the tone. But that is a minor issue and does not hurt the film in a meaningful way.

","The good acting of the cast aside, this movie is disgusting. Let me say this now: infidelity in marriage is NEVER acceptable. What Charlie did, regardless of how unfair he thinks he's being treated in terms of not receiving his wife's affection is nowhere even remotely close to justification.<br/><br/>That being said: this film's portrayal of a messy divorce is one-sided and clearly pushing an agenda.<br/><br/>Let's ignore the flat cinematography, the pedestrian editing, and the dialog written by a 20 year old art student major and consider the fact this film is clearly pushing an agenda. Nicole lies, helps commit a crime, and manipulates Charlie because of her own sense of entitlement for some misguided sense of ""empowerment."" At the same time, Charlie is treated as a inept moron without her. The production company they have praises Nicole incessantly because of (no joke) her suggestion of arm placement for a performance. It is also custody propaganda where the idea of women wiping out a man's entire livelihood is justified because ""men are accepted for their flaws where women are not."" Are you kidding me? What ridiculous nonsense. It's as if the writer behind this dumpster thinks their own misandry is justification for every horrible act committed against a man.<br/><br/>This is ridiculous. The parody of the fight scene in social media between the two is the least of this film's problems. Women DOMINATE in divorce proceedings, and (as somebody who have seen family members go through divorce) the men are disproportionately punished in the proceedings. If this was an out-and-out ""man bad, woman good, she gets custody and everything is right with the world"" story, that would be one thing. However, this is trying to come across as an ambiguous tale when this woman clearly chooses to lie to her husband, make him suffer, destroy every aspect of his life, and use her son like a prop in her machinations. And the film treats this as justified, and it is rather sickening.<br/><br/>Art doesn't need to conform to your sensibilities of morality. It doesn't need to make you feel happy. The acting is great, no one can deny this. However, in the world of brutal litigation in divorce proceedings, this film is quite abhorrent in how the message appears to encourage pre-emptive, brutal, and vindictive actions to cause the most amount of suffering is rewarded in full. What an appalling piece of dreck."

The humanity, sensitivity and candor in Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances coupled with an exemplary script provides for a grounded film unfolding with endless layers of depth that mine the audience of emotional catharsis.<br/><br/>The simple title: Marriage Story aptly encapsulates the film. It's not a divorce story, It's about a marriage of dichotomies and dualisms. NY vs LA, stage vs screen, work vs play, family vs friends, actor vs director, performance vs authenticity. It may be hard to comprehend that throughout the film as we witness Charlie and Nicole fall apart but its in the final sequence that Baumbach really reconciles the dichotomies. He tenderly reveals to the audience that it was not his intent to show how different each side of the dualisms, but to shine a light on the overlap, the grey areas, the messiness of trying to draw lines in the sand."

","Charlie and Nicole are separating. With a young son to think about they intend to do it all fairly and amicably with no animosity. But then the lawyers get involved.<br/><br/>I watched this expecting a much more gritty exposition on relationships than the cheap romantic dramas which seem to litter the cinematic landscape. My favourite romantic dramas tend to be ones where things don't work out (e.g. 500 Days of Summer, In The Mood For Love, the marriage-breakdown story in Love Actually) as they make for much more original and interesting stories than your usual trite happily-ever-after stuff.<br/><br/>Initially Marriage Story is quite disappointing though. It moves at a snail's pace and nothing really happens until about 40 minutes in. Viewer patience is rewarded though as things do get much better eventually. Once the parasitic lawyers get involved the plot becomes much more interesting and the pace speeds up as the situation spirals out of control. It also demonstrates that divorce only ever benefits the lawyers.<br/><br/>These plot developments do also take the movie into unoriginal territory, as Kramer vs Kramer already covered the trauma, trials and tribulations of a divorce, and did it better, covering it more intensely and engagingly.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on it becomes more profound and engaging and the ending is very powerful and emotional. The performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson also help drive this quality, especially towards the end when their relationship is at its nadir. The confrontational scene between them near the end is superb.<br/><br/>A tighter first Act and this would have been a much more engaging and compelling drama."

From the first moment and throughout you're reminded of Annie Hall, with the immediate voice over, the way it's shot and all the NYC v LA jokes. Also, Kramer v Kramer does come to mind due to the plot itself. It's not as good as either of those movies. It was funnier at times than I expected so Its not all sad and heartbreaking.
It did get so heavy handed though every time they showed Adam and Scarlett being separated by a fence or pulling their child from both sides. I mean, we get it. They're separating. But overall a very good movie."
"catchuanbu","7","5","6","4 January 2020"," Individual performance
","Marriage story is a insightful and solicitous look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. The plot is a pastiche of a modern day ""Kramer v. Kramer"". It has lots going for it including two very charismatic and convincing performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a married couple, This is original filmmaking at its finest.<br/><br/>
The core issue is that the breadwinner is Charlie and his wife Nicole wants to move from NY to LA to get a part in a show. Charlies elects to stay in NY and continue directing his successful broadway plays. Both parties here are selfish. Couples interactions are pure and honest but more importantly real, you don't get to take sides in their problem as well as they both make a good case and put forth good arguments to their difficulties, one other thing I noticed is that it invites you to understand but never forces you to accept it in any way, all of this comes together to describe or at least try to understand the intricacies of a loving marriage.<br/><br/>Marriage Story accurately exposes what actually goes on when couples turn to lawyers to help them with their divorce rather than go thru mediation. Kudos for exposing our circus of a legal system and the lawyers who are still practicing this archaic type of matrimonial law that wreaks destruction on parents, children and bank accounts.
Minus - The couple never actually asks the child what he's going through. Good movie."

Personally, being a male and having had a quite shaky relationship with my father, Driver's performance hits really close to home and touches on all the feelings I didn't want, but expected, it to.<br/><br/>A truly great film that has good chances at winning many awards.

"faitheden","8","5","6","14 December 2019"," A beautiful and honest portrayal of divorce and love
","Review: Marriage Story (2019)
Marriage Story is a heartfelt and unique portrayal of modern day divorce, encompassing all aspects of a gruelling and often one-sided experience. Noah Baumbach succeeds once again in achieving beauty in every aspect of his film, from its stunning Los Angeles setting to its impressive cast. Adam Driver plays Charlie, a highly successful stage director hoping to move back to New York, while Scarlett Johansson plays his wife, Nicole, an actress whose career grew as a result of her husband's fame, but who realises that her marriage has stripped her of independent identity. The couple struggles between their undying love for each other and their increasingly different life goals, which would lead them to opposite sides of the country, making spilt custody of their eight-year-old son impossible. Marriage Story is filled with highly emotional scenes, in particular a heated argument between Nicole and Charlie, during which they both say the most hurtful things possible to each other before breaking down in tears of guilt. Also moving is Adam Driver's singing scene, as his suffering is clear is clear in every note and facial expression. The film's soundtrack has been nominated for Best Original Score at the Golden Globes, and although not too impressive on its own, it fits the cinematography perfectly, especially in the beautifully timed opening sequence. What I like most about this film is that it presents a more uncommon type of divorce, where it is not a lack of love but a lack of compatibility in lifestyle that tears the two apart, making the process all the more painful and uncomfortable to watch. While it's doubtful that Marriage Story will come out on top at the Golden Globes or Oscars, it is certainly an important film that will stick in many viewers' minds for its beauty and complex portrayal of divorce and love."

"surajpnair","9","5","6","13 December 2019"," A film that beautifully delves deep on separation
","Marriage Story is a film that held my attention throughout the running time. No please do not get me wrong, this is NOT a thriller/suspense film, rather a film for every couple/married couple, so easy to relate, and end of it we are left with an incomplete feeling of wanting the couple to reconcile.<br/><br/>The film starts with a monologue from the protagonist, it's a turn off for me and I was skeptical about the film to have all the cliche ingredients to establish the principle characters and the proceedings of this film. Surprisingly the treatment is way matured here, and from thereon the film takes us to their world where we as a viewer relate, decide and analyze every other decision the couple take to separate.<br/><br/>The film obviously drives into 2 perspectives and this eventually builds up the differences/frustrations/confusions among the couple during the course slowly yet steadily without losing grip on the narrative. To add more vigor to the conflict, there are court room sequences wherein the couple realizes that this is getting out of control and this is the point where the characters transform.<br/><br/>Even the inert love for each other is portrayed with such undertones that these characters evolve as real characters and we relate to this particular phase the characters are placed in to.<br/><br/>A film which has fantastic performances by the lead characters, the pacing of the film was very well thought of, since the genre of drama takes a slag during climax to fuse overdose of emotional baggage, that is not the case with Marriage Story. The climax is so subtle and it ends on a proper note retain the journey as realistic as it could get,<br/><br/>Marriage Story - Highly Recommended!!"

Although I have not personally gone through this from any perspective, I hated to see it happen to these people. My predominant feeling at the end of this was that I didn't like any of the lawyers.

"andrewburgereviews","9","8","11","6 February 2020"," The middle-aged and the restless
","Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" begins with a slideshow of a man and a woman over which we hear narrations, each of them describing themselves and praising their family qualities. These descriptions are carefully written, their qualities grand beyond family life, is like they are trying to sell themselves for a job interview. But no, these are husband Charlie (Adam Driver) and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and the descriptions are what they each wrote about the other. They are in a counseling office--they are getting a divorce.<br/><br/>Two qualities make this movie great. First of all, is the balancing act between the two parties and the second is its unpretentiousness. ""Marriage Story"" has no subliminal meaning, the divorcing couple don't act like some sort of higher symbols--what you see is what you get. The balancing act, though, happens on multiple levels. For starters, is the fact that Nicole and Charlie still love and collaborate with each other despite the divorcing act--which started without lawyers--becomes an interstate case between Los Angeles and New York--two polarizing states, both geographically and culturally. Then, is the fact that you don't know who to root for. The divorce is as complicated for the viewers as it is for the characters.<br/><br/>The reason for divorcing is nothing too tragic--typical middle-to-upper class stuff. Charlie is an acclaimed theater director respected on Broadway and despite not being born on the East Coast he is ""more of a New Yorker than a New Yorker"" according to his wife. Nicole is an actress playing in his productions but who feels the need to break free. Her ambitions are more Hollywood and LA than NY. They also have a son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), caught in between. Happily, he is too young to suffer too much.<br/><br/>All the performances are astounding. Driver as the workaholic but caring husband, Laura Dern as Nora Fanshaw--Nicole's LA smart, upper-class feminist lawyer--but Johansson steals the show. Her ability to direct her emotions--crying, angry, laughing, regretful--is brilliant. Her performance truly is theatrical--tragic, dramatic but not overly-dramatic. A definite Oscar contender. Throughout the movie, as the divorce escalates, there is clearly a slight bias towards Nicole, but Baumbach's on-point writing is careful so that Charlie doesn't come off as a complete loser. His career is thriving and his unusual friendship with his mother-in-law offers some of the funniest and warmest moments in the movie. She is the one who secretly recommended him an affordable lawyer. She wasn't doing that because she is against Nicole, but because he likes Charlie too much.<br/><br/>While this movie is straight-forward, there is a particular lengthy scene worth mentioning (no, is not the fighting scene albeit it was perfectly executed). The scene in which an appointed expert evaluator monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry is as strange as such an experience is expected to be. Such things involve the evaluator watching the family's natural behavior but can anyone act naturally under such conditions? The scene ends with a clever ""accident"" caused by such a procedure and it no doubt lead the evaluator to many misunderstandings.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is no doubt a movie that could happen to only a middle-to-upper class couple. Charlie and Nicole--the middle-aged and the restless--are people who are both artistically-inclined and privileged enough to want more specific things. And with a child bonding them, their official separation feels like it exists only on paper. But sometimes that is enough. Even if, in the end, a winner was declared, Nicole's career was floating and Charlie was surrounded by his friends and peers, they both lost."
"arungeorge13","8","8","11","25 January 2020"," Baumbach delivers a raw, realistic stunner! [+81%]
","It's wonderful to see a filmmaker like Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg) tackle a simple, basic subject and elevate it to greater heights. He has displayed the ability to convert a raw, realistic marriage-divorce saga into something so deep, mature, hard-hitting, and engaging. The brilliant writing (by the director himself) is backed by exemplary performances from its entire ensemble. Marriage Story did remind me of Asghar Farhadi's A Separation at certain points, but it's a film that's wholly American in its texture, its perspectives.<br/><br/>Adam Driver (as theater director Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (as theater artist Nicole) are both stunning in their own right. They make their characters appear extremely grounded and believable and it gives us the feel of watching the divorce proceedings of a couple that we have seen and known very well. While the core theme of a couple going through a divorce may not seem like fresh material for feel-good cinema, Baumbach actually makes it look earnest. The film opens with the two of them reading out (in their minds) what they love about each other only for the viewer to realize that they're sitting in front of a mediator.<br/><br/>It's a solid hook for an opening scene. You're immediately drawn to the lives of Charlie and Nicole. You want to know what drove them to the point of separation when they just spent ten minutes talking in length about each other's strengths and adorable qualities. Baumbach takes the rom-com route to tell his story but in a strictly sensible fashion. The exes want to keep things friendly for their son Henry, but they soon realize that they're drifting away from each other. The lawyers of the splitting couple, Nora (Nicole's lawyer; a splendid Laura Dern), Jay (Charlie's first lawyer; a pointy Ray Liotta), and Bert (Charlie's second lawyer; a calmer Alan Alda) keep adding further layers to this increasingly hostile wedge.<br/><br/>The dialogues score brownie points. They're razor-sharp, filled with sarcasm and double entendre, and delivered with potency by each member of the ensemble cast. It also goes on to show the intensity of love, relatability, and understanding between husband and wife who slipped up in their personal lives while tending to their careers. Baumbach makes it clear that the institution of marriage lies in its basics: the prolonged eye-contact, the haircuts, the tying of the shoelaces, the making of breakfasts, the monopoly sessions, and more along those lines.<br/><br/>And oh, not to forget, there's a fair bit of comedy too, the kind you wouldn't expect in a film such as this. I love the way Charlie reacts to multiple people telling him L.A's got 'more space'. I also love the way Nicole's mom and sister prepare themselves to present the divorce petition to Charlie, just the way scene rehearsals (for theater or cinema) would look like. Marriage Story is incredible in the way it offers clarity to the arguments of both husband and wife before the decision is made. Its straightforwardness is incomparable."
"XabisoM","9","8","11","20 January 2020"," Amazing acting and a compelling story.

We get the couple expressing their feelings about why they love each other. The film does an excellent job at portraying the perspective of both characters and pulling us into caring about both of them.<br/><br/>Although this movie is mostly sad and is about a sad subject you will find yourself laughing out loud a few times. Two particularly funny scenes come to mind, one is were Nicole, her mother and her sister are talking about serving Charlie the divorce papers. The other funny scene is when Charlie accidentally cuts himself.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy the singing at the end but other than that I enjoyed everything else."

I was one over with the opening monologues from each of the main characters. Adam Drivers performance was breathtaking, really showing us his full range as on actor. His argument with Scarlett johansson in the backend of the film had so much rage, despair and pain that I felt for his character as the film was building. Scarlett johansson's performance was very good also (much better than Jojo Rabbit, still trying to see how that got a nomination, let alone best film. Rubbish film).<br/><br/>Honestly think this had a shot at best picture at the academy awards. If not it should be 1917.

"springfieldrental","8","8","11","19 January 2020"," Lesson in Divorce Expenses
","Before getting a divorce, examine whether it's worth hiring a lawyer to handle sticky situations that the two parties can resolve among themselves. If an arrangement can't be settled upon, then get a lawyer, the higher priced the better.
That's the lesson I walked away with when viewing Marriage Story. A brilliant script from a person who had first hand with divorce proceedings, this film details the breakdown of a marriage and the self-interests between the couple in wanting possession of their young child. The acting is justifiably well documented as being worthy of Oscars, and the narrative is pinpoint in its depiction of the struggles of a divorcing couple.
I guarantee that after the release of this movie the divorce rate will decrease since the pain and agony of splitting up is far greater than putting up with a selfish, cheating, argumentative spouse."

"davidmvining","9","8","11","17 January 2020"," Inspired by Bergman, but very much it's own success
","Even before Noah Baumbach showed us the article with Nicole and Charlie titled ""Scenes from a Marriage"", the movie screamed of influences to Bergman to me. The main characters are a theater director and an actress (like in After the Rehearsal). There are shots that evoke Persona. And the basic story feels like stuff that happens between episode 3 and 4 of the Swedish television series. The actual divorce in Bergman's film is largely glossed over, skipping from the admission of infidelity to the final fight that leads to signing of the divorce papers, but it's the sole focus of Baumbach's film. Aside from all the Bergman influences, though, this is a very good film.<br/><br/>The movie uses a framing device that works incredibly well. The first ten minutes of the movie are two letters written by each of the main characters that details how they love the other, however they were written at the behest of a mediator for their divorce, trying to establish a ground floor of emotional contrast from their current situation. The problem is that the letters never get read. Nicole hates what she wrote, but Charlie is open to reading it. Yet Nicole barges out of the office before anything can be read, her rage at the very exercise.<br/><br/>She has good reason to be angry, having discovered that Charlie had a brief affair recently while he was also unhelpful in moving them from New York to Los Angeles where she wanted to get into television work. He, though, almost single-handedly made her a serious actress after bringing her onto his theater troupe after her one big credit of ""girl who takes her top off"" in a teen sex comedy, while she also hasn't had sex with him in a year. Let's just say, the situation is really messy.<br/><br/>The mediator was their effort to settle the divorce without lawyers, but everything goes sideways when Nicole moves her and their son to Los Angeles and she hires a high-priced divorce attorney. Suddenly even the question of whether the family is based on New York or Los Angeles comes into question, a turn of events that Charlie simply can't believe. He's behind the ball, trying to play catchup on California divorce law and get a lawyer while suddenly needing to establish a residence in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The process is the punishment in this film, and both Nicole and Charlie get punished (with heavy implications that this is the fault of the lawyers). They end up dragging each other through the mud with the central point being custody of their son. Charlie is shocked at how easily Henry adapts to his new life in Los Angeles while expressing nothing but disdain for his former life in New York. Charlie does everything he can to try and reconnect with the child he suddenly finds that he's on the verge of losing, all to little avail.<br/><br/>The movie is at its absolute height, though, when Nicole and Charlie fight. There's so much hidden anger within the relationship that comes out in that famous fight where Charlie beats a hole in the wall. The scene really hinges on the acting talents of Black Widow and Kylo Ren, and both Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver rise to the occasion, delivering blistering performances of pure unadulterated rage. It's a marvel to behold.<br/><br/>The messiness of life ends up sorting itself out and a truce of a sort ends up falling into place. It's a messy end to a messy story, but the journey is harrowing and sad. The ending of the framework comes when Charlie finds Nicole's letter from the beginning of the film. These were two people who did love each other, who got a lot from each other in their relationship, and who not only decided to split but who also let their acrimony against the other determine the course of the divorce, damaging both of them in the process. The portrait is incredibly compelling and a wonderful look into an ugly process that never seems to have a winner."

","Another movie about divorce and child custody. We all know divorce is terrible, a 'death without a body' as the movie states. But, this movie isn't concerned with sending a message. It isn't really about plot, or story, it's about great acting, and fully developed characters. The characters are so well written, each with their own flaws, it's difficult for the viewer to take sides. It's a character study of two well meaning people that just shouldn't be together.<br/><br/>It's a well made film, but at the end of the day you could also just watch Kramer vs Kramer, Mrs. Doubtfire, or one of the other thousand movies about divorce."

For that matter, even the other all-star actors were exceptional and convincing in their performances. I did however feel the 137 min runtime was way too long and the pacing could've been faster. This film needed to be trimmed down/paced faster to a max 110 mins. There was some unnecessary fluff that should've ended up on the cutting room floor, specifically the ending singing performances. Plus I would've named this film ""The Divorce Lawyer Story"". Nevertheless, it doesn't get any more realer than this."

","There's a lot of the kid and plenty of wailing in this prosaic, mostly boring series of monologues. ""The Squid and the Whale"" was a good movie, because the characters were all edgy in some way, and portrayed by real talent. The story developed and had compelling psychological turns. This film, on the other hand, is really a poor attempt to portray dysfunction and fails, even as it wails, and wails, and wails.<br/><br/>It gets two stars for good acting by Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, who are not even given top billing. Scarlett Jo and Adam Driver are painful to watch. Sometimes scenes begin without taking any particular direction, or adding anything to a wafer-thin story.<br/><br/>Also the purposeful homage to Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" was a cheap attempt at elevating this thing. And ending with the same text that it started with, well . . . simply lazy.<br/><br/>Give it a pass, or use it to help you sleep."

","Very well acted. I've never been through a divorce myself but I've heard this is a very accurate representation of most marriages that are ending in divorce. My wife and I both said ""this should have been called ""Divorce Story"""" because it's mainly about the divorce this couple goes through and doesn't really show much about their marriage. I guess you can glean what their marriage was like by what the divorce reveals, but still it's really about the details of the divorce. I thought it was odd how civil and friendly they were with each other one minute and then they would literally blow their stacks at each other the next. But again maybe this is common for most situations like this and I've never experienced it. Worth seeing and the best performances I've seen from both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson."
"ryanhall-24065","10","9","13","21 January 2020"," A masterpiece from start to finish
","Noah Baumbach wasn't on my list of best directors of all time, not even on my radar, until I saw this film. On Netflix, of all places, which has been known to produce a lot of unappetizing garbage. This film, however, takes the well-worn concept of a failing marriage and makes the 2 hours it takes to explore that marriage worth every last second. You don't feel particularly biased toward either side of the marriage, and there is no clear hero/villain for you to condemn/cheer for. It's exactly what these kinds of situations end up like in real life, and the movie portrays it flawlessly. And that's just talking about the actual script and cinematography; if you're also factoring in the absolutely best performances I've ever seen from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson then the film rises to even new heights. Marriage Story deserves all the praise it gets, and more. Congratulations, Noah Baumbach, you've made an incredible film."
"tomhiggins-82642","9","9","13","14 January 2020"," 99% Accurate to real life
","I think this film was almost flawless, having great acting from Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson and more supportive roles such as Laura Dern or Azhy Robertson. The movie has a great score; music coming in just when it was needed but not staying it's welcome. The story was great and so accurate to real life situations (not over-exaggerating things at all). The one 'problem' I had (which was barley a problem) was that 1% of accuracy. I think the film could have shown Charlie (Adam Driver) being more emotionally unstable; they did do this many times, yet I think that could have made it more common or more significant when it did happen.
The last minor bump i have is that someone who in their life has not experienced what this film shows may not connect to the film as much as someone who has. This could make the experience not as emotional as the viewer may not be as sensitive about the story. I think this is why maybe bringing more of that emotion into the film could help others understand/connect with the film."

Secondly, it proved Adam Driver to be the phenomenal actor that I have been told he is, and was unwilling to believe. What a waste of his talent Kylo Ren was!

"mrrabakluca","9","9","13","18 December 2019"," A beautiful film about the collapse of a marriage
","For me, there are several reasons this film is a 9/10. To elaborate, very few films, only a handful, for me are a 10/10. For a film to be 10/10 it must be perfect, this film was sadly so close but was, however, let down by odd sound mixing at the beginning of the film that lasted for a while.<br/><br/>1) The Acting
The acting is superb, some of the best of this decade. Incredible. The crying, the shouting, the slight show of frustration, the happiness and desperation they show to one another over the decay of the relationship. The acting is something that elevates the film to such a high degree and allows the characters to feel very real.<br/><br/>2) The Story
The story is well formulated. Now, I am not an avid romance film watcher, thus I cannot say if the story is unique in the sense of talking about divorce.<br/><br/>3) The Characters
There are no characters in this film that feels off or out of place. All acted well and non felt still. The sister of the wife (Scarlett Johansson) did feel a tad bit over the top/comical. Otherwise every character had a depth to them. A motivation that made sense and both had benefits and flaws like people do.<br/><br/>4) Cinematography
The cinematography isn't anything overly special. However, it does the job and is some instances looks very nice to beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, very well made film that I would recommend."
"burney-imdb","9","18","30","29 December 2019"," Wow... Real world divorce on screen
","This film hit really close to home. The acting was fantastic and realistic. The portrayal of the divorce lawyers, the guardian ad litem process, the court, etc, mirrors my own experiences and is something not portrayed typically in film. The film ends on a fairly happy note which may be the difference between the screen and the real world."
"Jared_Andrews","10","27","48","11 December 2019"," Simply Incredible (In a Beautifully Complex Way)
","The movie is called ""Marriage Story"" because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, the two leads, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, at the top of her game) and Charlie (Adam Driver, likewise) read from their lists of things they love about each other as we see beautifully spliced together examples matching the words. It's a charming, funny, and heartwarming open, and it in no way resembles the anger, frustration, and occasional vitriol these characters will spew at each other over the next two hours of the movie.<br/><br/>It turns out the letters were written after a suggestion made by the couple's mediator. He explains that he likes to begin with a positive note because of the harsh negativity that soon will follow. Oh how right he is.<br/><br/>The couple continues to reassure each other and themselves that they want to remain friends and keep this breakup amicable. They have no need for lawyers until they do. That's when the situation becomes volcanically contentious.<br/><br/>The lawyers know how the divorce game works, and they're hall of fame-level players. They gather all possible ammunition from the party they represent, then they hurl them at the other soon-to-be ex-spouse like a box full of live grenades. It's brutal to watch. Clever framing from director Noah Baumbach displays the discomfort and pain this causes each spouse to see their significant other lambasted mercilessly in court. Neither of them wanted things to go this way.<br/><br/>As gut-wrenching as many scenes can be, laugh-out-loud humor slips its way into just as many moments. Give credit to Baumbach's writing as much as his stellar directing. Surrounding all scenes, both crushingly sad and delightfully funny, is unceasing truth and fairness. Neither Nicole nor Charlie is made out to be the villain. They are both presented as fallible characters who are good people who happen to be dealing with one of the most challenging situations human beings can face. Divorce can bring out the worst in people and it does here. Which is what makes it such a miracle that Baumbach manages to keep both lead characters so empathetic. Baumbach's work is award-worthy in both the writing and directing departments, as is the acting of the two leads.<br/><br/>Netflix has been searching for a best picture winner for a few years now, and it looks like it might finally happen. ""Marriage Story"" is not only one the best movies of the year; it's one of the best of the last several years (and if this movie doesn't win, Netflix also boasts ""The Irishman."")<br/><br/>I'm sure ""The Irishman"" is fine, but I can't say for sure yet because I'm still too intimidated by that three and a half hours runtime. But I saw ""Marriage Story"" and it was incredible. It's as good a movie as you'll see all year, in the theater or at home on Netflix."

Not that every film needs a happy ending they don't, but some redeeming quality would be nice.<br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't get it, because I didn't.

Their combined skills really sell all of the points it makes about the and ugly unfair, and two way sexist legal complications behind the divorce process, as well as the emotional stress it can create between both parties involved. I think people who's parents have gone through a divorce or those who have themselves will easily connect with this movie on a personal level.

"CubsandCulture","10","10","15","29 December 2019"," A more balanced approach to a divorce story, one of the year's best
","The script makes a commitment to presenting both parents involved in the divorce responsible for both the marriage ending and the escalation within the legal system. The film works hard-in a tender realistic way-to avoid turning this into a battle of the sexes movie and the story comes across as fair *and* informed by reality. It is lacking some of the nasty MRA/Manospherean subtext that can crop up in films like this, i.e. Kramer Vs Kramer. Best of all the film has nice running sense of dry humor that really helps sell this as an authentic story. The film isn't even a dramedy but there is enough of a comedic energy present to make the tragic elements hurt all the more. The script is a tight piece of writing that is clearly been informed by lived experience.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good. Driver turns in one of his best performances. There is a entitled edge to his performance that rings genuine for the character he is playing. Johansson gives a tour de force of tenderness, anger and inner strength. She can be quite a good actress when given the proper material to work with. It was nice seeing Alda again in a role of the voice of wisdom.<br/><br/>The film's visuals and direction do not stand out in anyway. That is ultimately a good thing; there is a restraint here that puts the story in italics.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie."

This is the first film that I've watched in a long time that left me emotionally raw. Divorce is something that has impacted my life up close and personal on two different occasions, and the effects stay with you long after. But what's most important to remember is that even though divorce can be painful, it is ultimately necessary in order to move on with your life and not cause you or the person you once loved anymore pain because at the end of the day, we're all still human. Scarlett Johannsson and Adam Driver are absolutely perfect as well as soul crushing in this movie. I personally don't care about the Oscars, but I can guarantee that this movie and their performance's are gonna get a lot of well deserved recognition. Noah Baumbach has made a modern masterpiece that is equal parts funny, heartbreaking, and completely authentic. And this movie easily gets a 10/10 from me."

","This movie is so well acted that you can't help but feel a pit in your stomach as 2 people, who seem to still love each other, hurt each other over and over again.<br/><br/>The bulk of the hurt coming from Charlie occurred prior to the story being told, so he comes off as significantly more sympathetic. It's difficult for Nicole's character to be as sympathetic because we witness the ways she is able to hurt Charlie, and only hear about how Charlie has hurt her in the past. In one culminating outburst, he declares that only being unfaithful to her once was a favor because of how popular he was and how many times he wanted to be unfaithful to her. Still, this outburst comes after his child has been taken away from him, his money is being systematically drained, and his entire career is collapsing- and even then he immediately apologizes for saying it.<br/><br/>They both seem to really like each other, and both claim the other is a good parent, but still they find themselves in a courtroom with lawyers making them each sound like neglectful monsters.<br/><br/>There is a final scene in which Charlie and his son are reading together and Nicole is standing outside the door, and it really crystallizes how great a family they could've been if they could've just been a little less selfish about the little stuff like who gets credit for what and what city they should live in.

I wasn't a fan of Randy Newman's score which I felt was slightly overused and played at some inappropriate points which took me out of the reality of the film.

","Hopefully ""Marriage Story"" will net Scarlett Johnansson an Academy Award. How many actors go from adorable child stars to capable adult performers to among the greatest performers working?<br/><br/>I had my reservations about ""Marriage Story"", though. I like Noah Baumbach. His movies are like antidotes to the wafer thin perfect protagonists you get in every other movie. However sometimes that can be a bit much. There is a layer of humour and irony that counterbalances the generally unlikable nature of the characters. But it seems a delicate balancing act. Is ""Marriage Story"" the movie where Baumbach finally falls to the net, and provides us a cringe-inducing story of unlikable characters doing hateful things?<br/><br/>The answer is, as you've no doubt guessed, no. It is true that the characters do not endear you to them immediately. Cameos from Ray Liotta and Alan Alda (well into his eighties) come as stark relief from their selfish behaviour. But if anyone can turn this into a strength, Baumbach can. It's artful the way he makes us come around to his characters, letting us feel the push and pull of a divorce settlement, siding with one, then the other, and finally, endearing us to both of them, people who grew apart as they grew on you.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is one of the year's best films, with a career best performance in front of the camera from Johansson and Driver, and a career best performance from Baumbach behind it."
"mariolosaccols","10","6","8","26 January 2020"," Marriage Story is an American comedy-drama film on divorce written and directed by Noah Baumbach and released by NETFLIX in 2019 and nominated for Oscars 2020.
","The film is starred by Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johnasson (Nicole) both nominated for Best Actors in a Leading Role as well as Laura Dern (Nora) for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.
The story talks about divorce between Charlie and Nicole.<br/><br/>Since I have seen the trailer I felt in love because I lived a version of this film in my own life and I looked back at my middle childhood and so I think to know what use to happen when your parents don't love each other any more.<br/><br/>The two main soundtracks by Randy Newman are very sensitive and powerful because they turn out to be exaclty Charlie and Nicole's personality.<br/><br/>Even though they broke up they still take care each other because of their similar and complementary character. (For example Nicole makes Charlie fell comfortable even in embarassing things.)<br/><br/>The photography director Robbie Ryan used neutral color to make clean and tidy scenes.<br/><br/>Acting is simple, sweet and meaningful like the scene in which Charlie cannot open the pickle jar and Nicole is there to help him. It is so cute.
I constantly wondered how it could be possible that Charlie and Nicole wanted to get divorce while I have been watching the film.<br/><br/>
So, why should the film win the Oscar?<br/><br/>The film should win because these are normal stories that could give an important and valid example to follow."

","Excellent drama! I found few similarities with the dearest 'Annie Hall' by Woody Allen, which I later confirmed by googling. The conflict between NY and LA life-style works as a catalyst to develop the character arches for both the main leads in Marriage Story, which comes in Annie Hall's third act. One may question: where is the originality in today's referential storytelling? I think it is in subtlety rather that structures and formats."

Incisive and bitter yet deeply humane and ultimately compassionate, writer/director Baumbach has created a stirring, sharply-crafted examination of irreconcilable differences, the toll of wreckage and the shared hurt, where blame is felt, weaponized, and ultimately beclouded. It's an imperfect creation, to be sure, with certain scenes and moments that veer off course (the ""knife trick,"" lawyer Dern's speech while prepping her client for court questioning, etc.), but there are plenty more sequences of raw honesty, understated power, and relatable discomfort that ring true. Driver and Johansson both give bravura performances, as good as they've ever been before, and it's a testament to the angles they choose and the confidence in the characters they portray that neither one can (or would) claim any kind of ""victory,"" Pyrrhic or otherwise, once the smoke finally clears.<br/><br/>86/100"

","Marriage Story is a realistic, grounded, heartbreaking, depressing movie; yet somehow you find joy in it. Most people at least know someone who's been divorced whether a friend, a brother/sister, or even theid own parents. When watching this film, it's almost like your feeling the pain of both spouses, what they're both going through, how they feel, and they're real humans. None of this could've been done without a great screenplay and acting. Baumbach's storytelling and directing carries a good chunk of the film, bringing the pacing and tone together. One thing that is phenomenal about this film is the opening, where Charlie and Nicole are describing each other in these long, expressive monologues; that alone is easily one of the best scenes of film in 2019. Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give real performances; showing off the simple extent that an actor can take while acting yet pulling so much of the intellectual and emotional force. However, the musical score is a little obnoxious and doesn't fit the tone and Laura Dern's performance, while well acted, is kind of overhyped for what it is. But, if your looking to cry a little and learn something about the world... watch Marriage Story."

","Maybe it's the relative dearth of movies about real people and real life that has critics and amateur reviewers falling over themselves in praise of Marriage Story. Maybe it's the sheer novelty of being drawn into a story that unfolds on a human scale, without magical powers, cataclysmic action and layers of CGI. Or maybe there's just something about this movies' attempt at a raw and visceral examination of divorce that has pushed buttons on both sides of the gender divide. Marriage Story certainly deserves praise for all those things, even if it doesn't deserve maximum stars and unqualified acclaim. The film's main virtues are the central performances. Driver and Johansson are strong enough to make you care (or almost care) about two not overly likeable characters, and they're real enough to (again, almost) overcome some of the more contrived aspects of the story, dialogue and direction. Even more so, Laura Dern and Alan Alda embody the best, but mostly the worst of the legal system, playing wildly different divorce lawyers - from well-meaning but ineffectual (Alda) to malevolent and toxic (Dern). If there's one aspect of Marriage Story that's truly great, it's the way it totally skewers the legal profession. Aside from that, it's a rather patchy affair. Obviously an acrimonious divorce calls for a flawed couple and some entrenched, unreasonable viewpoints. Even so, it becomes increasingly hard to buy some aspects of the irretrievable differences on show here. Charlie goes on believing that he and Nicole still live in New York, long, long after it is abundantly clear that this isn't the case. And Nicole is just too easily swayed by her rottweiler of a lawyer for us to believe that she's anywhere near as well-intentioned as we're supposed to think she is. The final showdown between the estranged couple - and the big acting tour de force for both leads - is both tortuously contrived and clumsily written. It takes everything Driver and Johansson have to (almost) make it fly. Thereafter Marriage Story becomes quite nauseatingly mawkish and sentimental, so much so that it's almost like another director has been brought in for re-shoots. The lowest point is an extended Sondheim homage that starts with Nicole and her mother and sister in a weirdly slapdash performance of You Could Drive A Person Crazy (they're all playing professional actors, so one has to wonder why it's so bad) and ends with Charlie giving an impromptu and supposedly gut-wrenching piano bar performance of Being Alive (both songs from Sondheim's Company, a show about marriage). It's hard to feel anything other than befuddled when a movie that has spent two hours trying to convince you that it's virtually a docudrama suddenly bursts into song. But if you can, the only conclusion is that Noah Baumbach has failed to come up with any original conclusions about the pros and cons of marriage, and has instead resorted to quoting Stephen Sondheim. And he's not necessarily wrong - there's as much wisdom in those three minutes of Being Alive as there is in the other two hours and twenty minutes of Marriage Story. So, to summarise what Baumbach seems to be saying: divorce is hell, divorce lawyers are evil, nobody really deserves either, but if you're looking for a take on marriage that is both profound and uplifting you should probably get a DVD of Sondheim's Company."

","Exquisite in its script, performances, and craft: the feels are real and raw and wrenching, and there's a lot of them (love, hate, heartbreak, awkwardness, tension, release); the leads, meanwhile, bring them all home, and the camera knows to just stay focused on them and not cut. In its monologues, songs, long takes, and dramatic emotion it almost has the feel of a theatrical play (with the troupe and their babbling commentary serving as the chorus), and it works perfectly with the material."

","Charlie and Nicole Barber (Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) are a New York couple working together in the theater world and in the process of ending their marriage in an amicable manner. After Nicole takes their young son with her to Los Angeles to live with her mother, she begins divorce proceedings.<br/><br/>In a five-year period beginning in the late 1970s, there were three exceptional domestic American dramas that won many hearts and numerous awards: ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" (1979), ""Ordinary People"" (1980), and ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983). ""Marriage Story"" has revived this genre (at least the part of it that wins much positive attention) and raises the bar.<br/><br/>Director/writer Noah Baumbach has succeeded in making a divorce story that is sad, gripping, funny, and even somewhat of a thriller at times. There is so much to ponder in every scene whether it be subtle or harsh. And as it reflects modern life so accurately, its impact is stunning and lasts well after the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>Baumbach is blessed with a superb cast especially in his leading players who each have a standout individual scene plus a dialogue scene that hits it out of the park.<br/><br/>Near the beginning, Johansson is exceptional in a scene in which she summarizes her life situation to her lawyer. Near the end, Driver is extraordinary in a revealing scene in which he struggles to fight back tears. But each is at their best in a confrontation scene that lasts several minutes. That scene alone belongs on a special ""best of all time"" list and should be mandatory material for future acting students. It is at least equal to the renowned confrontation scene between Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann in ""Scenes from a Marriage"" (1973).<br/><br/>The film is also blessed with a great supporting cast. As Nicole's lawyer, Laura Dern is cleverly devious as someone who can barely conceal her shark teeth behind a seemingly smiling demeanor. As another family lawyer, Ray Liotta easily matches the Dern character's disregard for humanity. (The legal profession is ripped to shreds in this film.) On the lighter side, Julie Hagerty is funny as Nicole's flighty mother; so is Martha Kelly in a small role as a mousy court evaluator who must observe how each parent relates to their son.<br/><br/>The power of ""Marriage Story"" could easily make it the best film of 2019; it could even be the best film of the decade. - dbamateurcritic<br/><br/>RATING (out of four stars): * * * *<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:<br/><br/>Directing by Noah Baumbach<br/><br/>Screenplay by Noah Baumbach<br/><br/>Acting by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson"

I was wonderfully surprised by how much I enjoyed Marriage story and how much it affected me emotionally. I was particularly invested in those scenes of almost mundane frustrations that don't rely on actors crying and screaming but the subtle hints of frustration.<br/><br/>Adam Driver has quickly risen the ranks as one of my favourite actors and this is the role that he was born to play, there is a sequence of scenes in this film involving him having to deal with a series of events that Adam Driver plays brilliantly, so accurately reflecting that frustration of just wanting to get something over with. I was mesmerised and absolutely burrowed into that emotion that was not over the top, but real.<br/><br/>I loved how this film portrays both sides of the argument and never paints one person as a bad person, as the audience we get to unravel how exactly they fell apart in their marriage but never once does it point fingers at one character nor paints them as bitter or hating each other. There is always a sense of hope in the details of the interactions between Charlie and Nicole that almost develops into a 'will they/won't they' situation; which was fascinating but I am glad that wasn't the direction they were taking, because realistically this isn't something that would happen. But it is the fact that despite them having a failed marriage these are still two people who care about each other and most importantly their child, and going through this strenuous and almost paradoxical circumstance of lawyering up and family court does not change that. It is these subtle moments that makes me absolutely adore Marriage Story."

","The theme of what it means to be a human seems to be getting into the Hollywood cinematography more and more - and Marriage Story carries exactly that theme, among others.<br/><br/>The value of this movie is mostly given by the story and how it was built, although the aesthetics are quite pleasing and there are some scenes (e.g. when Nicole first opens up to Nora about her marriage with Charlie) that make you aware of the directors' presence behind the camera, in the sense that they make you pay attention to details you wouldn't normally notice (how Nicole casually walks around the room, goes into a bathroom, then the slow close-up on her face while she is making her speech).<br/><br/>Marriage Story presents us with a couple having deep-seeded respect and admiration for each other, which is normal for healthy relationships, however one small decision down the line creates a disastrous butterfly effect. The story of the separation, then the divorce, the lawyers, the fight, the observer - is tragic for a lot of reasons.<br/><br/>First it shows us the cruel world of legal fights, where everything can be used against you in ways you couldn't have anticipated. It is difficult to perceive being a lawyer as something noble, the legal system as something that is supposed to deliver justice and to even get married as something that is worth doing if there is even a slightest chance of getting a divorce in the end.<br/><br/>Then it shows you how lack of money puts you at an incredible disadvantage (which is the case for most aspects of life anyway) and how easily someone can crumble because of it.<br/><br/>It shows you that everything is up for interpretation (e.g. punch in the wall) when there is no context. And even if there is context, people will still misunderstand you (e.g. the knife scene).<br/><br/>It shows you that two people who love each other can metaphorically hold knives against each other under enough pressure. And then it leaves you thinking...<br/><br/>What if?
What if she read the letter?<br/><br/>And you realize that it would not matter anyway, because too much damage has already been done. Which could be okay, if after the whole drama they find happiness again. But then you realize that humans can be so stupid sometimes. You realize that humans are unpredictable, scary, scared - and they never really know what they need. Because they are ""figuring things out"".<br/><br/>This isn't to say that being human is bad or anything - it's just that being alive is not easy and sometimes being alive is not great. But in the end we are alive and we make the most of what we are, what we choose and what we get."

My parents divorced when I was a young adult, so I spent all of my ""growing up"" life in a two parent household. When they eventually split, I only saw the outside of what was happening. What Marriage Story did is show me the strife and pain that can happen during a divorce from the position of those going through it. It's not stylized or romanticized like a lot of TV shows and movies can portray. It shows you the raw and unfiltered feeling that can explode amidst anger and fear and change. It drags you in on both sides so you truly can't say ""Well, Nicole is right"" or ""Charlie is right"". This, to me, feels like the truest-to-life portrayal of a divorce."

","The script, score, and direction are amazing but the performances outshine everything. Scarlet Johansson is really really good, but Adam Driver is unbelievable. I've seen many great performances and I'm not exaggerating when I say that Adam Driver's performance in marriage story is perhaps the best performance I've ever seen by an actor or actress. He breathes into his character so much life, and in one particular scene (you'll know it when you see it) I broke into tears because of how well he delivers a line and how believable it is. It's not necessarily the line itself, it's all about the delivery and I truly believe that no other actor could deliver it as powerfully as he did. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely mesmerizing in joker and should take the Oscar if any other year, but Adam driver gives the performance of a lifetime and will surely give Phoenix a run for his money at the oscars."

","Everyone should watch ""Marriage Story"" on Netflix. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, soul crushing, maddening, raw & real movie. It was difficult to sit through, we had to stop several times because it made us feel things we didn't know we needed to feel. Some scenes literally seemed like they'd filmed them of us. The acting was superb & the emotion was so on point. It's a love story told in the harsh light of life. Despite not having gone through some of the same things or circumstances as the characters, I related to their words & actions because of having been in the relationship I am. It made me stop & think about how I am as a partner, where I'm strong & where I need to change. I'm glad we didn't see this in a theater because I don't know that I'd have felt so strongly about how amazing it was to see this story captured. It's just real & I feel like I don't walk away from much anymore with such strong feelings."

","Marriage story is a masterpiece filled with some of the best performers in the last 20 years. Scarlet Johansen and Adam Driver give the best performances of their careers. The emotion and passion they show is incredible. I can't express how much I love this film. It hit me at an emotional level unlike any other film I've seen all year. The writing is the best of the year and perfect. The movie feels natural and honest to the situation they are in. The direction is beautiful and masterful. The film as a whole is amazing and worth watching because it's unlike anything you'll ever see. Driver and Johansen and clear frontrunners for best actor and actress respectively and truly deserve it. The depiction of a divorce was so raw and real, and that's were this film excels in the sense that the film feels real. You experience every emotion of sorrow and heartbreak to anger and hatred. The score is great and beautiful. You can really feel a connection with each character of Charlie and Nicole and feel empathy for each of them.
Overall this film is perfect and one of the best in recent years. The performances are revolutionary and masterful. The direction is articulate and beautiful to watch."

"random-70778","Null","88","185","22 October 2019"," Chance for Baumach to be honest, instead a very dishonest film
","I think it is nice that Noah Baumbach met and got close to Greta Gerwig in Spring of 2009 during the filming of Grenberg, when she was playing a woman who was having an affair with a older man in a film Baumback wrote. She's 25 and the male lead is 40 in the 2009 film. Except Baumbach was married during that year of close work. Maybe knowing this helps illuminate aspects of this ""story"" that are totally absent in the 2019 film.<br/><br/>When you are in the film business, as screenplay writer and gaining fame and power from a first couple of hit films, and you are getting a divorce about a year after ""meeting"" and working ""very closely"" with an actress who is much younger than you or your wife -- while your wife is pregnant -- and then divorcing your wife -- perhaps it is a good idea to write a film which that ignores those inconvenient facts. I guess. I mean if you got a typewriter why not whitewash what is transparently proffered as your story to make it about mutual alienation and not something more tawdry (and more typical behavior of men in Hollywood).<br/><br/>But I'm sorry: as an audience member I don't want to be lied to. Therein lies the problem with Marriage Story. It was an opportunity to be honest yet it is a profoundly dishonest film. In fact it is deceptive narcissism of a very high order. Exploring the truth would have taken courage and would have been brilliant and real drama.<br/><br/>Sure we all lie to ourselves, but frankly I don't want to hear, or watch others' lies about their marriagse. An unreliable narrator is one thing, it is a good plot device, but not when sold as a reliable one.<br/><br/>OK on the positive side half of the acting, specifically by Johannson, is great. Adam Driver seems sedate, but he is ok in this."

","This should be titled Divorce Story. Pure trash and completely narcissistic. When Ricky Gervais told hollywood that they have no clue of the real world, this movie is a perfect example of that. It is just a narcissistic trash movie of themselves. Also, it is pretty sad in the depiction of people trying to figure out life, but refuse to believe in any type of truth that would help them."
"kittie-38112","1","45","89","21 December 2019"," Went in blind, felt super disappointed.
","I decided to watch this movie based on my friends recommendation. He hadn't seen it either, but heard it was getting much acclaim and it looked really real based on the trailers. Given my love for movies or shows that potray reality or don't have happy endings (one of my favorite movies to this day is still Requiem for a Dream and BoJack quickly became one of my all time favorite shows), I decided to watch this without viewing any trailers or reading any reviews.<br/><br/>Within the first 20 mins I felt bored. I kept going to give it a fair shot to see, maybe it gets better. Nope. The only part i enjoyed was watching the lawyers, which was also, in my opinion, some of the only good acting on screen.<br/><br/>The whole movie seems incredibly forced. There are SO many useless scenes that go literally no where. Like that scene with the woman observing Charlie and Henry? Not only was it, boring and awkward, it was completely pointless and didn't advance the story at all.<br/><br/>I also hated Nicole. At first, I wasn't a fan of Charlie either, but by the time they reached the fight scene and you find out he only cheated when they were somewhat separated, I was 100% on Charlie's side. She's selfish, manipulative, a liar and puts Charlie through hell after making believe she didn't want it to be complicated to begin with. And then at the end, she thinks it's unfair that he gets 45% custody?! WHAT?! I was so annoyed by that.<br/><br/>Then, the movie ends abruptly. It's just a terrible ending leaving so many open ends! I thought ""what? That's it? That's how it ends?"" when i saw the credits come on.<br/><br/>I say don't waste your time. I have no idea why this has such a high rating or how it can make anyone cry. I cried when Frankenwienie died (Everytime lol) but this, this is an empty shell of a movie attempting to be deeper than it actually is.<br/><br/>The ONLY part that made me feel bad at all was when Charlie takes Henry trick or treating after Nicole. She's a cow for not letting Charlie join the prime time and it's sad watching try to find candy. That's it."

She feels like she's invisible and breaks apart an entire family, when I'm pretty sure she can just speak up. I'm sorry but these things frustrate me when people dramatize situations and ruin fifty lives with a divorce, when simply talking could help a little. I'm pretty sure many people can relate to it, and I'm sure my comment probably seems dumb because maybe a marriage is irreparable at times, but in this movie, it just seemed slow paced and hard to understand the divorce.

I was also quite disappointed to learn in the first act that they are both actors. This could've played much better if they were ""normal"" people, as opposed to pretentious theater snobs.

"gabo_alepb","10","7","10","19 February 2020"," A modern clasic.
","I'm gonna put it bluntly: Marriage Story tackles a lot of problems in modern society without being judgmental, pandering, condescending or adoctrinating, that is a lot to say in a culture full of preachy actors, producers, writters and directors in Hollywood. In the last decade we saw a lot of pro-this anti-that cinema but this movie avoids taking sides in the political conversation and prefers to do what art is meant to do in culture: create or exemplify beauty and myths. This is a great accomplishment in writting, it reminded me of the best AlmodÃ³var dramedies where everything bad that is meant to happen is going to happen and you get to know and love the characters for what they do in these situations, not for what it is imply about them. I think both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave great performances but it's Driver's that really gets into your skin. The story about a real (almost too real) broken man dealing with a horrible situation is something that Hollywood has seem to put away in the closet for a long time. I haven't liked any Noah Bumbach's films until this one, but keep them coming. It was great."
"sparkshark-59860","9","7","10","16 February 2020"," Don't understand the low reviews here
","The main criticism that this film seems to be getting from the other reviewers here is that the script itself is boring. I just can't wrap my head around why this is what people are criticizing it for. The story wasn't meant to be an exciting on the edge of your seat thriller. It's an incredibly emotional and dramatic story that plays way more on what isn't said that what is. Baumbach paints us a painfully real couple watching the downfall of their marriage. Trying to maintain their own individuality while also balancing being part of a family. Balancing their dreams with those of the people closest to them.<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both greatly exceeded all expectations and provided an incredibly real feeling that isn't easily obtained. By the end of it, it doesn't feel like you're watching two actors, it feels like you're really witnessing Charlie and Nicole try to figure out their lives.<br/><br/>Highlight scenes were: Courtroom scene, Fight scene, Charlie accidentally cutting himself, Nicole's monoluge to the lawyer, and my personal favorite scene; Charlie singing ""Being Alive""<br/><br/>I seriously could talk about Charlie's singing scene for hours, it blew me away, and it pains me that some of the other reviewers here were not able to feel the same emotion from it that I felt. ""Being Alive"" is a famous broadway number from a showed called Company. The show focuses on marriage and the pitfalls associated with it, culminating with Robert singing ""Being Alive"", vocally capturing the effect that finding love can have on our lives. He acknowledges the good and the bad, but mostly the impact that it can have and the way it can make you really feel alive. Charlie singing this in front of all of his friends is absolutely genius and it's scenes like this that make me fall in love with writing again and again. Charlie, a self-made director who's entire life and career is built on just how much he loves theater, and you can tell from the way he speaks the dialogue parts that he knows this play well. His singing is the perfect mix of: someone clearly involved in the arts who's knowledgeable about singing, but also someone who clearly isn't a singer. He's still just the director and he'll never be the lead actor. The pain in his voice and emotion he is able to deliver in just that scene, for me, makes the movie one of the most emotionally moving movies I've ever watched as well as places it up there with some of the greatest dramas to ever come out of the movie industry.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film. Don't go into this film expecting to just enjoy the story and move on with your day, you have to embrace every aspect of it. Let the emotion of the main characters sink into you. Allow yourself to feel their pain. Let this movie capture your emotions and it will change how you look at drama for ever."

","With their impending divorce on the horizon, an L.A. based former teen actress and a self-absorbed N.Y.C. based theater director confront the many cracks in their relationship, and try to recall what they once loved about each other while vying for custody of their son. Despite their attempts to settle things amicably, the reality of the situation brings some long simmering emotions to the surface. A thoughtful mediation on marriage is beset by a few awkward moments in the script, but the up and down themes of love, family, parenthood, and all the emotional baggage that come with them are genuine, and it's acted with great conviction. Johansson and Driver both dig deep and give career-defining performances, along with a standout supporting turn from Dern as Johansson's cutthroat divorce lawyer. ***"
"schroederagustavo","10","7","10","18 January 2020"," Deeply Emotional Film
","I don't like to write exaggerated stuff on the internet, hyperbole if you will. But, seriously though, Marriage Story is one of the most personal and emotional films I have ever seen, driven by solid direction and a great script, but mostly by two powerhouse, really outstanding performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johnson. It's a very simple premise, it's a movie about a family going through a divorce. But it's executed extremely well, to the point that I swear I even forgot I was watching a movie. During the scene where Scarlett Johannson's character is explaining to Laura Dern, who is also awesome in her role by the way, why she wants the divorce, that part of my brain that always wants to analyze movies, was gone and got to the point where I was just watching, not even Scarlett Johannson, but a heartbroken woman explain why she wants to go through with the separation. It's great. And it's done in a very tasteful way to give us both perspectives, we get to see what Adam Driver is going through and also what she's going through, so we get to understand both sides. It's not like one is the bad guy and one is the good guy, it's never like that. I loved this movie, it brought one or two tears to my eye, outstanding performances like I said and would highly recommend."
"smithpaulusmc","9","7","10","17 January 2020"," Absolutely Heartbroken
","I am absolutely heartbroken. Noah Baumbach's newest venture Marriage Story is a deep take on marriage falling apart as the family violently attempts to stay together. Marriage Story stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson who play growingly estranged husband and wife. Charlie (Driver) and Nicole (Johansson) have spent years raising their son and working creatively together in a New York Theatre company, but their irresolvable differences have pushed them towards divorce. Although they wish to end things amicably, bloodthirsty lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) steps in and pits the warring parties against each other.<br/><br/>Marriage Story masterfully showcases the hurt divorce spreads over families each day. As an audience member, I was physically pained to watch Charlie and Nicole's relationship disintegrate even though they both so desperately wanted mutual happiness. This strong emotional drain is due to two main elements, Baumbach's impressive ability to write natural conversation and the lead actors beautifully played roles. Baumbach crafts scenes that are not too dissimilar to early American Independent works that captured life as it really happens. He plants clever ""ticking time bombs"" into every scene that drive the plot forward like an unstoppable train. Driver and Johansson are believable to the point of ridiculousness. I truly felt as though they actually loved each other; I felt the pain behind their words. Most importantly, credit to both writer and actor/actress, I never sensed melodrama.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is falls into the category of once every few year character-driven masterpieces. The last of which was Manchester by the Sea. These movies move you, forcing the audience to reevaluate their intentions and their outlook on the world. Marriage Story is a must for movie lovers that could only have been better if shown on the big screen."
"k_fogleman","8","7","10","16 January 2020"," The honesty makes you cringe
","Scarlett Johansson is so unlikable in this movie but I guess that's the point. Depending on what character you most associate with, you may feel different. Adam Driver gave a fantastic performance as did Laura Dern in a supporting role. All the truth and ugliness behind why some relationships don't work and how complicated that split can be with kids and extended family. There doesn't have to be a big event- someone cheat on the other, gets sick, etc. Sometimes you just grow apart or realize how you've been held back by your relationship. The viciousness of the divorce lawyers is a necessary evil but that doesn't make it any easier to watch."
"MrPupkin","9","7","10","15 January 2020"," At its best, this movie is searing. It pinpoints many of the little talked-about aspects of divorce that seem the least significant but hurt the most.
","Driver and Johansson will surely receive all the nominations for their great performances in this film, but Laura Dern and Alan Alda also deserve tons of credit for the job they do. The story is well written for both the husband and the wife's perspective. It almost hurts to watch it at times but in the best way possible. The audience is somehow led to root for both sides, accepting both characters' strengths and flaws. An extremely well-acted, and pretty well-written film."

Everything about it is perfection. Driver & Johansson are heartbreaking & phenomenal, though with writing this perfect, it'd be hard to imagine anyone really screwing it up. It's a perfect mixture of real & beautifully heightened, quintessential Baumbach."

Many good review here but the topic is kinda serious and somehow such happening everyday. Loving someone have a time limit, but responsibility is whole life. Somehow they are inseparable and know each other so well but live together is not an option. It's the truth and not overdramtic, vividly telling the marriage story of many couples. Scarlett is awesome, it's her best performance in her career. She is my best actress."

Johansson and Driver both giving memorably raw and tender performances.<br/><br/>Another pleasure lies in three tremendous, supporting performances from lawyers' Dern, Alda and Liotta. A stand out scene is an argument where Johansson and Driver tear strips off one another with an uncomfortable viciousness. This film never loses its sense of humour and absurdity.

"someokiedude","8","7","10","9 January 2020"," Why do we love those who we eventually grow to hate?
","I used to go to parties that my parent's friends would throw when I was younger, and many happy memories were had when we would go in the summer time. Unfortunately though, all good things must come to an end as the people who would host the parties eventually got a divorce and thus the parties ended, and despite the fact that they weren't my parents, I felt like as if my parents were getting a divorce. I always felt empathy for my friends that I grew up with whose parents got divorced rather it be for one reason or another. I fortunately never had to suffer through a divorce, as my parents have been happily married for almost 30 years now with no intention of seperating, so I didn't know how I would react to this film.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a film that I would call an 'actor-driven movie.' Much like films such as Good Will Hunting, 12 Angry Men, or A Few Good Men, Marriage Story is a film that's reliant on the actors and their performances. Not many movies like Marriage Story are made anymore, where actors are just given room to explore what they can do and I think that Marriage Story joins the films that I mention above as one of the best actor-driven movies that I've ever seen. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson aren't even acting in this film, which might be the highest praise I could give. I felt the blur of emotions that Driver and Johannson convey throughout this movie and I felt like these were real people, not actors playing a role. It's simply some of the best acting I've ever seen from Driver and Johannson, the rest of the cast are also strong, with a motherly like performance coming from Laura Dern or a grandfatherly performance coming from ol' Hawkeye Pierce himself, Alan Alda. Another thing that I loved about this film is how it doesn't allow you to take sides, the film showcases both of the main character's virtues, as well as their flaws and you can feel the frustration that they feel towards each other, but also the love that they still have for each other, despite everything that's happened. If there's a motif for this film, it would be that it makes you feel...a lot.<br/><br/>There's no such thing as the perfect film of course, but much to my surprise I only had two problems with this movie, one being the performance of Ray Liotta, who becomes a bit grating as the abrasive lawyer though, to the film's credit, I think that was the point, and a scene where Driver's character sings, and while Adam Driver surprisingly has some good voice chops, I felt that it didn't really service the film in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>Luckily, the film wasn't the 2 hour and 16 minute depression fest that I initially thought it would be, Noah Baumbach shows skill in littering in some humor and light hearted moments to balance with the bittersweet, somber tone of the film. There's also Baumbach's masterful use of tension that illuminates most of the scenes that Driver and Johannson share, and not in a suspenseful way, but rather in this lurking, uncomfortable sort of tension that's just itching to get out. Another thing that I expected to see was fighting, and there wasn't much of that, except for two instances...just two. But then again, most of the film is carried by that sense of uncomfortable tension.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a film that deals with a number of difficult topics and emotions, but it is a film that deals with its themes and emotions with a sense of grace that makes me want to seek out more of Baumbach's work in the near future. It was simply wonderful, and you would do yourself a disservice if you don't see it."

","Let's face it. Baumbach is clearly a fan of Woody Allen, later Ingmar Bergman and Sydney Pollack. He's classically schooled.
This is no news, though. We could see it sip through in his earlier works; the humanism, the humour and the great eye for details. Both in the form of cunningly interspersed metaphors and everyday things. While the dialogue is excellent, the visual language communicated is just as subtle and balanced.
We follow a couple and their son. Her an actress, him a theatrical director, during the excruciating escalations of their divorce. Seemingly without them anticipating any of it. A plot like this could easily be bland and repetitive without the writing and directing from someone like Baumbach.
When it comes to acting, this kind of movie needs experienced and highly talented participants. Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and the whole cast deliver just that. And more!
This is one of those movies where both cast and crew exceed themselves and thakes their art and career to a whole new level.
All this to the beatiful and fitting musical score by Randy Newman.
Without doubt the movie of the year!"

And yet, despite a really tense argument, these two people apologize, mostly treat each other with respect, still hug and kiss greetings (she even still calls him 'honey'), make way for one another and little kindnesses as they build a new life that will keep their son centered. It's mature and loving even with the breakup. Strongly recommended. (I took a couple of points off only because I found the lawyers and home investigator ridiculous.)"

","Poignant, heartbreaking, and stunningly realistic, Marriage Story takes typical break up stories to a whole new level. The film is downright emotional, with no shading away from the darker sides of the issues it knows it holds. These issues, however, don't technically take the film down in quality really, but the dull moments are extraordinary dull, and at times the film can certainly be hard to watch. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are absolutely fantastic, providing both brilliant and utterly harrowing portrayals, that are certainly more than memorable. The supporting cast is more than good as well, the script is shockingly deep and harshly honest, and is quite brilliantly shot. In the end, Marriage Story is hardly just a plain piece of cinema, but a work of art. Noah Baumbach has created something utterly brilliant, and though at times it may not be quite a entertaining or very enjoyable experience, it is certainly a more than memorable one, and provides for one of the great cinematic achievements of the year.
My Rating: 9/10"

"justintannerpw1","1","38","75","9 December 2019"," Horrible Score Derails Entire Film
","Last night I watched the first twenty minutes of Marriage Story. I love everyone involved in the movie so expectations were very high. But immediately, (IMMEDIATELY) the intrusive, BUSY musical score started to drive a nail into my head. Here were two monologues; letters written by the lead characters about each other. They were smart (if a little precious) and heartfelt and full of nice details. However, the entire time Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were speaking, this wall to wall orchestra kept sawing away, frolicking and gamboling like a Rossini overture underlining the moments with 'whimsy' and the promise of 'heartache.' Like a bright yellow highlight pen, the music left no room for independent thought: I was being told exactly how to feel about every second.<br/><br/>But I got through the opening bits; although I didn't quite buy any of the director/actor theatre scenes- Why is that no one ever seems to be able to capture the truth of what it's like to do small theatre? Those ridiculous rehearsal scenes were painful in their ostentatious inauthenticity...and don't get me started on the actual performance of the play. It was almost exactly like that old SNL sketch ""Bad Conceptual Theatre"" - If only Dan Aykroyd had stepped out as Leonard Pinth Garnell to give a review - Even more hilarious was the discovery in a later scene that this awful slice of ""high art"" was slated for Broadway. In what universe?<br/><br/>But I stuck with it until the scene where Scarlett Johansson reminds her husband that she finds it difficult to cry onstage only to walk into her bedroom and burst into tears. This is a moment that should've wrecked me. It's beautifully set up, and would have been totally unexpected and rending. But at she walks through the hallway towards her bedroom, the score whips up into a Soap Opera ready string-filled cry of anguish so generic it could have been used for that old Carol Burnett sketch As The Stomach Turns. The camera pulls in to show Scarlett's tear-filled face - but any empathy is immediately sucker-punched to the ground by the hideously OVER THE TOP music.<br/><br/>Cut to: this morning as I scanned through the Golden Globe Nominations. Not only is that exercise in bathos and banality actually nominated for Best Original Score... It was written by none other than Randy Newman. <br/><br/>If I make it through the movie it will be with the sound off and the subtitles on. I like to decide how I feel about things. I don't need to be smothered in kisses to know I am loved. And I don't need to be swaddled in a treacly, syrupy, honey-laden, jokey, telegraphing soundscape in order to understand that sadness or joy are on display. I'm pretty sure I'm smarter than that. My CATS are definitely smarter than that. It's no coincidence that Bennett coughed up three yards of hairball during the first thirty seconds of the movie."

"stickbob123","2","26","49","6 January 2020"," Bland. Arrogant. Emotionally Immature.
","I hated this movie. I wanted to review it right after seeing it, but thought I should cool down a bit so I don't come off as simply ranting. It's two weeks later. I haven't cooled down yet. This is a bit of a rant.<br/><br/>I definitely don't have the marriage experience under my belt to fully empathize with every situation in the film so there's a bit of distance for me there I suppose. That being said, I absolutely love Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage which this film is clearly trying to emulate. In that film, both characters have a believable mix of logic/irrationality in their approach to life in general and specifically their marriage and subsequent divorce and their conflicts are built on true, possibly irreconcilable character differences that have been established instead of random off screen past events or, as is more often the case, nothing. And in Scenes from a Marriage, the audience sees them first as a team in a seemingly very good relationship so when things start to go south they never stop hoping they'll work out in the end. In Marriage Story, I found it hard to care about a failing relationship that I was never invested in to begin with. Also, the story was clearly going for a realistic (maybe gritty is the word) look at marriage and human interaction, and yet every single side character was a, ""how can I be as quirky as possible with my dialogue?"" excuse from the babysitter saying ""You two are so attractive!"" to the social worker being a mute psychopath to all the theater company people being parodies of ""actor-types"" (what a waste of Wallace Shawn). Even the main side characters like Laura Dern and Ray Liotta felt like reductionist portrayals of their types of characters. Johansson's character starts out as a convincing, real-feeling character, but after her ""my husband is great and I'm a dummy"" speech to Laura Dern at the 30 minute mark, her actions become vague and inexplicable and the audience doesn't even get to see her that much. Then she practically becomes the Darth Vader to Laura Dern's Emperor, acting as a proxy antagonist for the entire film as she weaves a web of financial and time inconvenience for our poor poor hero Driver. Her arc felt like a bro-dude at a bar trying to convince his friend that his ex-wife is a itch instead of an honest attempt to craft a character. At the very worst Johansson is intentionally mean, vain, and practically evil. At best she's portrayed as stupid, getting strung along by Dern and only the heroic Driver can see through that. Also Dern's monologue about feminism was nothing that anyone on earth would ever say, it was staggeringly out of place and contrived. And also she bases the entire argument around the ""Judeo-Christian concept of motherhood"" because of The Bible's portrayal of Mother Mary. Too bad the word she was looking for was probably ""Puritanical"" or just ""christian"" since Judaism doesn't give a rats behind about Mary. The beginning of the film practically announces that it will be an even, fair portrayal of two peoples' sides of a divorce via the similar-in-length letter reading, but then Driver becomes the obvious protagonist and the only person who makes even a scrap of sense. And the whole LA vs NY side theme(?) was so shoe-horned and over done, it felt truly childish and the film never even attempts to explore either city as most of it takes place in ugly rooms in a sound stage that could have been shot anywhere. Every time they say ""Let's go to (insert LA location here) they end up going to Pasadena. Every part of LA leads to a space-time portal to gosh dang Pasadena in this movie, they didn't even attempt to get the layout right. And also the entire approach to the film seemed to be ""Let's show divorce from only the scrappy, nitty-gritty legal side,"" which is conceptually interesting, but then they spend so much time with meandering pointless arguments (which is ""realistic"" I suppose) and then don't even show the final court scene. Maybe I'm a terrible person, but I actually cried laughing at the ""every day I wake up and I hope you're dead"" line, I had to pause the movie and rewatch it like five times. They were acting SO HARD.<br/><br/>Me cutting down Bombach is less important to how I feel about the movie in general, but the fact that this is based off his own divorce is disturbing. It's hilarious that he divorced Jennifer Jason Leigh who was extremely successful at the time of their divorce, but he portrayed her character as being a loser actress who's only famous because of his work and is in crummy TV shows. On top of that he gave himself a MacArthur genius grant (something his sister has but he does not) which is once again, hilarious. Truly arrogant. And that's another thing, Bombach could not possibly have chosen less relatable characters. A wealthy MacArthur grant arthouse play director and his theatrical partner/TV actress wife. Ah yes, characters for the every-man indeed. And then to bar you further from empathizing with them, he clearly doesn't even understand what being an arthouse theater director would entail and only chose that role because he thought ""hmm I can't make it TOO on the nose so he can't be a film director...he's a play director!"" Ta-dah! The only thing we see him do is make one joke direction, ""do it laying down, but also standing,"" or something quirky like that, and then choosing between two types of stools while he's on the phone. Two...types...of...stools. Two. In Western cinema, cheating on someone has been a standard unforgivable sin since its inception and at the very least something that needs to be directly dealt with and discussed. I have never seen a movie that downplayed infidelity so much, Bombach totally cheated on his wife and was like ""lol what's the big deal?"" and then portrayed it as such. And he didn't even care about the woman he had an affair with, he ignores her through the whole movie and she's portrayed as slightly unattractive which I think in some twisted way is supposed to make that even more OK. Driver's character tries to justify it by reminding Johansson that she didn't have sex with him for a year, a detail I never would have guessed, was never indicated anywhere early in the film, and I totally don't care about. So many of those arguments are just ""emotional exposition,"" characters saying deep, hurtful crap that is nowhere in the film and could have been pulled from any breakup movie. I hear the pain in the actor's voices (they're trying so hard), but I didn't see a scrap of it on screen. Also, Bombach's divorce happened in the 90s, but this movie is set in modern times and the time-stamp discrepancies are so funny. How does Johansson find out about the divorce? ""I saw the emails!"" No one has coordinated a salacious rendezvous via email probably since Bombach went babe hunting on AOL. And they use the kid as a sort of emotional scapegoat, trying to make Driver's character more empathetic by making it seem like he's being such a whiny bum because he loves his kid so much and doesn't want the divorce to hurt the kid, but the kid is practically a lifeless doll. He has no personality and is obviously supposed to be younger than the actor that was cast. Seeing Driver and Johansson struggle to pick up this 100 pound paperweight and act like it's a sweet four year old cherub was one of the great joys of the film. It's like Bombach is an alien who understands that kids=empathy, but doesn't give a damn about his own child enough to portray him with even an ounce of believable personality or emotional stakes (I've never seen a kid, especially that age, give less of a crap about his parents' divorce). And HOLY MOLY, so many on the nose shots that I would have thought myself a genius for coming up with during freshman year of film school and then looked back at my own work a mere month later with unholy shame such as Johansson and Driver slowly closing the big wooden gate together while standing on separate sides of it. Once again, if you want to portray a realistic version of a divorce, you can't smash me over the head with a visual metaphor that weighs more than the empire state building (or the Chinese Theater. Which is better? LA vs NY! Oooo! Art!). And the shot of them all in the bed together filmed so their faces overlap. We get it, you saw Fanny and Alexander. Bombach thinks that mirroring Bergman's cinematography will somehow yield the same results for him, but Bergman's technical approaches to filmmaking is only a means to end in service of creating characters that feel absolutely real, something Bombach knows nothing about."

","Terrible. It fools us in the beauty of its film stock. Baumbach always comes at us overwriting concepts into these mild tortures of the mind, he's like a malicious Woody Allen. but Woody had that filter of comedy-as failing in stand-up meant it's useless unless it connects. Plus he was informed. Baumbach wants it all ways on the merit of his brand, which is suspect to begin with. His scripts are always grating the more they talk. Its frame of self-reference through theater productions is a great thought, and we're offered the range of abstract bizarro theater to mindless sitcoms... of course! His condescension is infinite and goes in all directions. Artistic sincerity doesn't exist for him since he's still in this satiric auteur reality where authenticity is merely a gimmick, another abstraction of the intellect. Another clue is the theater players themselves, other'd as simpletons or fools for comic relief. Almost everyone is NPC'd. This is not wicked, but narcissistic. It's not that it isn't relatable, the breakups are the most real and painful experiences we have. It's that we can tell the lie. Scarlett rings false. She has already been a cyborg, an alien, a mutant, I was waiting for the moment she peeled her skin off in those uncomfortable closeups that seemed to want to demystify her on film. Driver rings false as her husband, as he seems to work not by his appearance so is wasted on film, but by his enveloping bro-ness. Too boyish to be so fatherly let alone a genius director. This is the least credible couple I can recall. Then all the ways it's out of touch. Remember they hand Scarlett a writing job out of nowhere and she thinks on it within two seconds, says, 'Sounds good but can I be director too?' and they go, 'Sure!' ...is that how it worked for you, Noah? Like what is this elitist reality they're pretending is ours? $650,000 grant? Sitcom royalties? LA v NY? Every review says Kramer vs Kramer, and that is doing this zero favors. Back then you could not fake integration. Word of mouth was not decided by algorithms. Today, Baumbach he's a rich kid wearing this as a coat, the film is not human but a tantrum with a blank check from netflix to do that thing that won all the awards. Its humanity is corporate manipulation for conquering all the other streaming services. And I know this is a low-blow, but I was psyched for it. ""Women are expected to be perfect."" The film is not neutral, it's about her actualization, even so much as she ends up a better director than him as he's forced into some kind of director jail. So it concedes his selfishness all along with his compromise, saying, he had all the fun. Scarlett's Story. ""Now I get what you were obsessed about."" For this battle-ground of the theater it offers her the ultimate prize of the Emmy nom, like it's Baumbach externalizing his deeply guilty conscience, maybe his privilege. But he sings, so takes some larger moral victory in taking the loss. ""You're the first person I talked to who treated me like a human"" ""It's because you remind me of myself"". Cynicism goes in every direction, everyone is other'd. But the film is review-proof, it works in the poster more than anything. It's in the title: ""Marriage Story"". It can't not work. It's universal, but it really tries, then it leans on cliches, nasty lawyers, comic visitations, there it works, it hangs on those for dear life."

Most directors are obviously influenced by previous films, but eventually create their own style. Noah seems to have become more and more like Allen rather than creating his own style.<br/><br/>Too much ""clever"" repartee and some of the cursing just seemed so out of place for the characters.<br/><br/>Adam Driver was miscast and Julie Hagerty seemed to have purposely cast to add humor, but again it feels forced and inorganic.<br/><br/>My main issue with the film was that I didn't buy the whole premise of two people wanting to resolve their issues between them but kept using THE MOST AGGRESSIVE attorneys that would yank up expenses. It made no sense. They would meet with the attorneys and have ridiculously contested issues and accusations and then in private an hour later they would be totally civil.

","Marriage Story is a depressing tale of how divorce turns people into the worst versions of themselves. The dialog includes preachy/pedantic dialog in which the screenwriter speaks through the characters instead of letting the ideas come out more naturally. For example, her lawyer preaches about how women are treated differently in the courts, which is true, but we are left feeling as though we are at a protest rally rather than in a consultation. Similarly, his lawyer preaches about how the system is set up to make merciless adversaries of the spouses, which also may be true.

","A couple gets divorced and lawyers are a**holes. There, that's the movie. I watched the first 25 minutes, then skipped around a bit and overall sat thru a good four-fifths of it while writing this review. This is just every divorce/troubled marriage movie ever made: Kramer Vs. Kramer, The Possession, Scenes from a Marriage, like half of what Woody Allen does. More boring everyday banality, a movie heavily in debt to the aforementioned Bergman and Allen (Alan Alda, who starred in Allen's 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' appears here as a lawyer. Scarlett also appeared in two of his movies) but nowhere near as good, no matter how badly it wants to be. A lot of it is courtroom proceedings/lawyer meetings and talk talk talk that I frequently spaced out during. Of course there's the ""powerful! Gripping! oh so moving!"" argument scene like you've seen in all the aforementioned movies, and it doesn't really go anywhere at the end. I'm getting fed up with Noah Baumbach's mediocrity. He may be a fine writer, but a pretty unexciting director. He's trying too hard to be Woody Allen (his debut was the infuriatingly boring time-waste ""Francis Ha!"", which was very Manhattan-esque), but without the humor and nostalgic charm of Allen's early work. This adds absolutely nothing new - screw the hype - I'll probably forget this one in a week."

He knew what he wanted and went for it.
She suggested things to him and felt ignored. Feeling unloved she stopped having sex with him.
Being in a sexless marriage, he had it with a coworker once.
Feeling like something like that had happened, she asks for a divorce, but wants to keep it without lawyers, she moves to another city.
She hacks his computer, finds out about the affair, and looks for a lawyer.
She serves him the papers for the divorce.
He ignores them for a while, because he's busy, and thinks they'll eventually get back together.
Untill he receives a call from her lawyer telling him, that if he doesn't get a lawyer and responds the suit, he can lose everything, especially the custody of the child.
He doesn't care about property/ money. Only custody of the child.
He meets an expensive dirty tricks kinda lawyer, but decides to go with an easy going humane lawyer.
Seems like he's going to lose with easy going lawyer, so he switches to dirty tricks lawyer.
In court, both parents see the lawyers escalating dirty tricks to win.
Out of court, parents decide to try to reach an understanding. They end up rehashing problems in their relationship, and getting angry and sad.
They reach a settlement for shared custody.
He finds a job closer to his son and ex-wife.<br/><br/>Opinion: Movies are usually filmed in slice of life genre. That is, what the audience sees could actually be what you see in real life. Theater is usually directed in very dramatic absurd ways to reflect and heighten the emotional drama the character is going through. This movie combines 2 styles in a jarring way.
Also, the movie should be called ""not meant for each other, and problems in communicating"", because 1) they aren't a good match for each other. They'd be much happier if they had chosen other people to partner up, and 2) if she had been more incisive with what she wanted (job and city), and he had been more precise with what he meant (didn't make it dubious, leading her on), they would've reached an understanding which wouldn't have led them down this path.
Also, this movie is at least 1h longer than it needs to be. And the characters are bland and boring. Also, this is very chick-flicky, as she is being a B*** and doesn't get called on her BS (no sex, hacking computer, lying about the city change being temporary, lying about no lawyers, lying about custody, being jealous of the attention he's getting, making the dad be the bad father by giving too many presents to the kid, and not making the boy keep his responsabilities, drinking everyday, going to parties while he works, having sex with random people, taking the couch, relying on her mother for life expenses, while he doesn't have a parent to help him out, getting 2 dream jobs and an award, etc) (while he has to switch cities, spend a lot of money to pay for all the law suit, buy an apartment, guard her house, make the child be responsible, gets little love from wife and son, etc)."

","Prior to watching, I heard it was sad but I did not realize it was gut-wrenching sad.<br/><br/>Personally, I've never been through a divorce (not even with my parents- thankfully) so there are a lot of things that I do not personally relate to in this movie. However, I was able to feel and empathize with the emotions on both sides of the divorce. The ending was definitely not satisfying in my opinion because it was so open-ended with no real direction of how their lives went on afterwards. All in all, movies like this I believe are meant to make you feel things, re-evaluate even and this does both."
"jackson_ro","7","4","5","11 February 2020"," Marriage Story
","An Uber-realistic take on a subject that is so personal to so many people in so many ways. It doesn't deliberately dramatize any element, but instead focuses on the two lead characters, which comes back and reflects on how a divorce can have an impact. The film carries a strong sense of melancholy, yet you still feel this connection as if they are drawn apart by circumstances but not because of love. But isn't how most people are? Most people don't actually know what they want and just get carried away by the waves. By the time you wake up, you realize so many things could have been avoided but you are so far gone already that there is no turning back. Both Charlie and Nicole are so unique yet so representative on couples and parents, it is both a testament to the script and the performance of the characters that they were portrayed by."

","Noah Baumbach manages to portray such an accepted event in families today with such intricacy and detail. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give some emotionally heavy performances, that genuinely feel authentic and honest. It felt raw and real. Baumbach manages to make such a mundane and sappy story so disheartening, which is what makes this film so exceptional."
"Vivkon","7","4","5","9 February 2020"," Making Money on Unhappiness
","The Marriage Story does not attempt to teach, does not explore new issues, especially for people who have experienced divorce and the division of financial assets and child custody. The movie scratches the souls of viewers by dramatizing the tenacious claws of the legal professionals that make money on human disappointment and conflicts.<br/><br/>The Marriage Story starts from at the breaking point of a marital relationship. Love has expired, but careers have advanced. For the main characters to get through this chaotic stressful process, therapist and legal advisors are called upon to ameliorate the situation. The beginning of the movie starts with the introduction of each character through the use of the opposing spouse's description. It creates a bridge of understanding for viewers, regarding the marital relationship. However, the break up, without legal action is unavoidable. That's why a significant part of the movie concerns legal intervention at the final point of the marriage.<br/><br/>The movie dialogue, especially that of Laura Dern's character, is particularly brilliant. Her monologue that most people deprived from fatherhood (God is father, father is on the heaven, accordingly children do not need to see their fathers - is a pretty persuasive rhetorical hook) sounds so argumentative, despite certain critics of the Christianity could be found (negligence in faith-based issues, presumption of inequality and etc.). Much of the lead characters exposition is reeled through the legal proceedings. Certain scenes look like the remake of Revolutionary Road (2008) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet). The sad part of the movie that it never shows situations where a win-win deal is possible."
"myopiczeal","10","4","5","4 February 2020"," Not surprised some people rated it low.
","What a great movie. What a heartbreaking portrayal of the ways in which people who mean well cause a mostly amicable process to become adversarial and poisonous. I guess if you were looking for a dumb parody of divorce written to lampoon or crucify one side or the other, or had never been through a divorce yourself, you could be forgiven for being disappointed or confused by the tone. Or maybe you're just not the kind of person who understands the nuances of compassion, because you're young and you lack life experience. Or maybe you just (sigh) rate movies low because they get deserved praise, and aren't action blockbusters. You should probably come back and watch this movie again in 10 years. Maybe then you'll understand how petty and small your 1-star rating was. I hope this film gets all the Oscars."

My only criticism is the way they made the young boy's character into such a brat. The young actor did a wonderful job, but the way the character is written made no sense.

"Adityaaaaa","9","4","5","24 January 2020"," One of the most realistic and touching films I have ever seen
","Despite starring A-listers like Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, the premise of Marriage Story seemed pretty cliché and sappy, so it wasn't something I was too excited to get into. However, it opened to an overwhelming account of acclaim, especially for its acting and screenplay, which encouraged me to watch it earlier than planned.<br/><br/>And while it takes a while to really get into, the 'while' that it takes is worth it, as the film becomes better, and better, and better. This film is not cliché. Nor is it sappy. If anything, it is easily one of the most realistic films I have ever watched in my life. Seeing as the director, Noah Baumbach, famously went through a real-life divorce with actress Jennifer Jason-Leigh, I think it's safe to assume he used many of the emotions experienced to his benefit in this film.<br/><br/>I have said before about films being so immersive that I forgot I was watching a film, but never have I meant it more than in here. Every single line is so life-like, and the performances show happiness, annoyance, frustration, distress, anger and more in such on-point ways, that I forgot this film starred people like Johannson, Driver, Dern and Liotta. I just saw them as characters. Something else I have to point out is the eight-year old character of Henry. Characters of this age are really hard to write, as you can write them like they're way too young and immature, or older than they're actually meant to be. In this film, however, the character was written with enough comprehension of his surroundings for an eight-year old, but with also enough innocence and naivety of other people's feelings. Azhy Robertson, who plays this character, also gives an exactly on-point performance that can rival with that of the leads.<br/><br/>But it's not just it's incredibly realistic acting and script. The sensitive way in which this film is directed, with the positions characters are in the scene, the colours around them, the production design and more, all add up to it's emotion as well. The film juggles a variety of tones, ranging from drama and courtroom-intrigue to comedy and quirkiness, while it never seems uneven. All the tones just blend in with each-other so well and everything just adds on to everything else. There are so many memorable scenes, that perfectly capture the right mood and feel, whether it be shocking, disturbing, sad, awkward, angering or funny. In addition to this: the editing was perhaps even more outstanding. Every timing of every cut is perfectly realised to show the specific reactions of characters to the specific actions of other characters and you barely realise when the shots are going from long-shots to close-ups because it's so gradual and in-the-moment.<br/><br/>The music was also handled brilliantly, both in the way characters sing, as well as the half-melancholy, half straight-out depressing background composition.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
Passionately acted, outstandingly written, and sensitively directed, 'Marriage Story' is easily one of the most realistic and touching films I have ever seen."
"avadianaushad","9","4","5","23 January 2020"," Great story, screenplay, direction and acting
","Marriage Story is a film about a couple getting divorced.
I won't get into too much details as I don't want to spoil the movie for others.
The story, screenplay, direction and acting are perfect.
There are a few scenes where the actors shine like the scene where
1. Scarlett Johansson explains her lawyer Nora why she wants divorce.
2. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson fighting with each other in Adam's apartment.
3. Adam reading the note that Scarlett wrote for him.
The only negative about the film would be that it can't be watched with family due to one scene and abuses.

This movie says a lot about the struggles between married people and it seemed very realistic and truthful in every aspect. If you are married it will seem like it's telling the story of your life - you've been through this n that when you thought you were the only one going through it. All couples go through the same problems in a marriage especially when it comes to divorce. The ending for me was Dull. The divorce process that is shows you is really ugly and it tells you what the ugly is. This IS A story and it was a sad one, told very well.

"justinwfirestone","7","4","5","3 January 2020"," Alda is priceless
","Marriage Story is a slightly misleading title, as it is not as much a story about a marriage, but is in reality, more of a divorce story. It is not a romantic comedy (romcom), but is maybe the avant garde of a new genre, the divorce comedy (divcom).<br/><br/>Despite the main characters being relatively loathsome, self-absorbed, and otherwise squarely falling into that mythical status of upper-middle class, it is difficult not to stumble along with them for their journey to at least try to become more self-aware. This is accomplished through laughs and cries, songs and dances, and attorneys.<br/><br/>ScarJo and AdDr are no Hepburn and Bogart, yet we get an inkling they could be a Taylor and Burton with a few more highballs. The real bravura comes from the side scenes with Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, and Alan Alda, all of whom would likely have seen success as attorneys had life's mysterious quirks nudged them that way.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Mr. Liotta in movies again, no longer trying to quit smoking, no longer extolling the virtues of savoring tequila, his face looking so tight he could have gotten whacked in The Irishman without the youth-enhancing algorithms. Better yet, Marriage Story confirms Mr. Alda can do no wrong, whether it be microwaving or eating."
"Flashback007","8","4","5","26 December 2019"," Familiar story with sublime acting
","The reason you should watch this movie is the acting performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. They are both great and have some wonderful scenes. Both together and separately. This is what makes the movie such an high high. Some scenes are so really though to watch because of this, be prepared for that.<br/><br/>The thing that brings this movie a bit (notice just a bit) down for me, is the fact that the movie-subject and even the story has been done before. It holds no surprises or whatever and people familiar with these kind of movies and want to experience something new, should probably skip this movie. Also for me personally for a movie tackling such heavy subjects the humor in it, sometimes just doesn't fit.<br/><br/>But like I said before the two main acting parts really make this movie worth a watch even if you're familiar with this kind of story. Even if the humor is sometimes weird and off. As soon as Johansson and Driver begin to act everything floats away and you're in for one amazing ride."
"El-Dod","7","4","5","26 December 2019"," A solid divorce story!
","I will have to start by saying that this is my first Noah Baumbach film and I have to say it didn't disappoint me but didn't reach my expectations as well. The three basic reasons for the success of this film is Noah , Scarlett and Adam. This movie is an acting ring having Scarlett and Adam competing with Noah as a referee and he handled the match perfectly. But I felt that Adam's performance was way better than Johansson's in every scene they were in it together I couldn't take my eyes off him even the master scene between them he won at the end of that scene with a K.O. Scarlett is doing her first awesome performance but I can't say it is one of the greatest performance ever but I can relate If she won the Oscar this year cause of the lack of powerful performances in Leading Actress category. The screenplay and the way Noah told this movie felt like I were in the 60s of the 2010s! The scenes and the looks of it made me feel most of it that it was in the past a really perfect look for each scene. The screenplay almost concluded everything that has to do with the divorce matter and lawyers interference in the whole subject and turning it into was. However, the movie had boring moments and the sexual stuff in it especially for Scarlet's character felt unnecessary on the contrary it is frequent with men which was represented by Adam's character without getting to show it. Also If the score of the film was stronger, it would have added to the scenes a make a better value for them but it was silent most of the film and even at the master scene itself. Didn't feel the kid much in this film or his acting too. In the end, a good movie to watch but I don't think I would watch it again. 7/10"

"CinemaClown","Null","4","5","21 December 2019"," A Love Story Told Through The Lens Of A Divorce
","From the director of The Squid & the Whale, Frances Ha & Mistress America comes a love story told through the lens of a divorce. Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach taking inspirations from his own life and pouring details of the separation process he himself went through into the script, and the result is a very personal, evocative tale.<br/><br/>The film captures the awful, ugly, messy & emotionally devastating side of marriage dissolution with utmost sincerity. Baumbach's script is as impressive as his direction and his own personal connection to the material allows him to be aware of where to draw the line and not get carried away, thus keeping things grounded & authentic at all times.<br/><br/>Helping the writer-director translate his story from script to screen are Adam Driver & Scarlett Johansson, both bringing their fragmented characters to life with fervour in what's arguably the finest performances in the careers of both. Packing a strong emotional wallop, their renditions unfold like emotions steadily rising to the surface until it finally explodes.<br/><br/>Laura Dern also manages to stand out with a smashing input, and steals almost all her scenes while that annoying kid gives the audience a reason why they shouldn't have one in the first place. The plot structure & execution resembles a theatre play, camerawork is fluid, employing long takes & close-ups in ways that only pulls us in. And thanks to smooth editing, the narrative flow remains streamlined.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach delivering on every front, and ranks amongst his best directorial efforts. What strikes out most about his latest work is that he captures the mundanity with same zeal as the story's vital segments, and addresses the themes of loneliness, heartbreak, agony, frustration & regret with an understanding, compassionate eye. One of the finest films of the year & certainly amongst the best in Netflix canon, Marriage Story comes strongly recommended."

It shows us, if nothing else, that divorce should be a last resort and that the biggest winners are the lawyers. Acting kudos to Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver, and Laura Dern , though it was sad to see Alan Alda's Hand shake during one scene. My old Rutgers professor D Fuller use to joke that every movie is a remake. This was no exception.

","This movie deals with the very real and depressing topic of divorce and how it can tear families apart. The plot of this movie follows a couple who truly don't love each other as they once did, which is something to look forward to because of its real and relate-able nature. If this movie had them break apart because they hate each others guts then yes it would be entertaining but not as memorable.<br/><br/>This movies' lead actors are at the top of their game in this one, they are without a doubt the best performances from these two actors. Adam Driver is able to convey a sense of anger and exhaustion in his scenes while simultaneously feeling desperate and alone. This requires unbelievable talent that definitely should not be overlooked by the Academy. Same goes for Scarlett Johansson, who is the other stand out performance in this film, due to her being able to play a vulnerable and still understanding character is truly a challenge for almost all actors and Scarlett pulls it off with aces.<br/><br/>If you have been contemplating whether or not to watch this please do, you will watch a beautiful story about family and how families stay together even after split apart."

But my second time around I realized that it doesn't matter who you are or what role you play in someones life; a divorce sucks for EVERYONE. After emotionally investing myself into the story and characters, it became a much more enjoyable, heartfelt, and crushing story. It was worth watching for the casts performance ALONE, and I could most certainly see either one of, if not BOTH, of the leads getting some sort of award for their performance."
"samyoung-82648","9","4","5","16 December 2019"," Solid film
","This is an adult film, probably most suited for those who have been through divorce. I have not had that pleasure and feel that I may have appreciated this story moreso if I had experienced divorce.<br/><br/>The story and the performances delivered are very credible. Driver (as Charlie) arguably has the best scene in the film. However, I would argue that Laura Dern has one of the most amazing performances I've seen this year from a female actress. Her character was one of the best villains I have ever seen. She is a hollow, self-seeking, manipulative and very destructive character who pretends she is virtuous and changes between destructive and sugar coated seamlessly. Otherwise, Dern's portrayal was meant to be virtuous (in which case it's the biggest failure I've seen in many years). I felt shivers when I watched her performance, similar to how I felt watching Phoenix in Joker.<br/><br/>For those who will point out Charlie's second lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta), his character was nowhere near as well played as Dern. He was destructive, but, he never pretended to be sincere or virtuous.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if there's a message I walked away from after watching this movie, it's about effective communication and how to unnecessarily complicate your life with lawyers. There was also an excellent lesson about how two people can be good for each other (especially when complimenting each other's weaknesses) and how Nicole (as a passive aggressive) struggled to take responsibility for her own life, while Charlie (as a perfectionist who was clueless about life outside of work) was made a better man because of Nicole.<br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Dern was the best adult female villain i've seen in cinema in a long, long time. Superb (unless she was meant to be a good person, in which case, this movie deserves a 4/10). In Hollywood today, it's rare to see such a well-crafted female character. Kudos to Baumbach for his courage and foresight to do so."

The movie is really so beautiful ,you can easily feel what our heroes feel in the scenes , you can't take any side of them you really cry for them , cry that sometimes there's no middle point , sometimes our love is hidden beyond our ignorance and selfishness that we might destroy our children just to prove who is wrong and who is right.
we could simply talk and try to be honest with each other. No one is ever perfect and no one will be.
The performance of Adam Driver and Scarlett is really amazing , you cry when they cry , you shed tears when they do , you feel compassionate to each one of them, you feel angry with their lawyers and what they are doing to them just to win in a fight where actually no one is winning.

"louis_southwood","9","4","5","14 December 2019"," A Marriage Story
","The subject of divorce is not something new for film, it's been done countless times by many rom com type movies that often end up coming of as disingenuous and fake. Well that's not the case with Noah Baumbach latest Marriage story, A compassionate and in depth look at the family unit in the face of break up with some of the most fleshed out and fully realised characters I have seen all year.<br/><br/>The Best aspect to this movie would have to be the script. Both are main characters (Played brilliantly by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) have so much character to them and feel like genuinely real people. We see both these characters for who they are, neither of these people are perfect and the movie doesn't shy away from that, rather than have a bias we are shown both sides of the story and even if you do end up siding with one of the characters at no point do you not understand and sympathise with the other. That's what makes Marriage story so special, because it never paints either of the characters as the bad guy, which in turn gives the film a much more genuine feel to it that you don't usually find in these types of movie. On A side note the movie is also extremely funny, The Serving scene specifically was just perfect.<br/><br/>The actors do such A phenomenal with the material here. Early in the film Scarlett Johansson has a long monologue that's given in one continuous shot, and I forgot that I was watching a movie. She felt so incredibly real and at no point did I see an actor giving a performance. Same goes for Adam driver, both actors are award worthy here. The Supporting cast is also great including the likes of Laura Dern and Ray Liotta playing the divorce lawyers.<br/><br/>With a run time of almost 2 hour and 30 minutes. Its Impressive just how quickly that runtime seems to go. That's mainly due to the fact that no stone is left unturned So to speak. Marriage story goes so in depth into the effect divorce can have on 2 people that any movie that came before (and potentially even after) ends up feeling as shallow as a puddle. This movie truly is something special and I can't think of a single person that won't enjoy this."

I never fathomed how hard it is to leave your partner but also maintain a good enough relationship for your child. To be completely selfish yet selfless at the same time. Marriage Story has opened my eyes to what 50% of marriages go through.<br/><br/>The pacing was amazing. I loved the editing style and the flow of the story.

Such a raw performance. I haven't stopped looping the scene of Adam Driver singing ""Being Alive"" because it was so goddamn beautiful.<br/><br/>If I were to nitpick and find a weakness in this film, I would have to say it was dialogue-heavy and lacked quiet scenes. There wasn't much time for the audience to digest the powerful scenes. Other than that, it was an amazing film that lived up to its high rating.

You like the characters, you hate the characters, but ultimately you know their true feelings.<br/><br/>Third, the overall meaning. Somewhere, I wanted the characters to end up together. Although, I knew they wouldn't. Usually the idea of divorce is ugly, hateful and traumatizing. In this story, it showed it is all those things, yet they didn't stop loving or caring about each other. It goes to show, just because you can't live with somebody anymore, that doesn't mean they aren't still important."

"theredsky","9","4","5","11 December 2019"," Marriage Story Review
","Wow. What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn't feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn't as mesmerizing as Driver's performance, it's still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver's serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn't groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver's character and it's great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it's the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It's one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as ""the guy from Star Wars"". The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don't top that scene. The film's plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I'm going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music."

","Fantastic performances by the entire cast! Laura Dern, Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansen, and Alan Alda are wonderful.
Marriage Story accurately exposes what actually goes on when couples turn to lawyers to help them with their divorce rather than go thru mediation. Kudos for exposing our circus of a legal system and the lawyers who are still practicing this archaic type of matrimonial law that wreaks destruction on parents, children and bank accounts.
This movie in it's frank raw telling should help dissuade couples from using traditional maritmonial lawyers and an antiquated court system both of which sorely need tort reform and regulation! Hint: Use collaborative lawyers or mediators, or stay married!
Marriage Story is also an intimate look at the emotions that boil under the surface of many marriages."
"ka-karina","9","4","5","9 December 2019"," A new classic
","A deep, raw and absolutely realistic new project by Noah Baumbach at times makes you feel like you are watching a hidden camera show - that's how true and close to reality it is.
This film is nothing new, and this story has been told many times before (""The story of us"", ""Blue Valentine"", ""The Break up"" etc), but i think love can be discussed endlessly and we still won't have a definite answer to what it is. Don't even get me started on marriage...
The performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are absolutely impeccable. They manage to let you inside the character's head and not only understand the actions, but even feel the way they feel for those 3 hours. Laura Dern was my personal favorite in this film, she was just such a badass, and the monologue about double standards almost had me applaud standing up in my living room.
What i think will make this film stand out for a very long time (as one of the reviews said - something like this only happens once in a lifetime) is that not for one minute did it feel forced in any way. I will specify that every argument, every line of every scene and every pause (even the fighting scene in Charlie's apartment that took 50 takes) was scripted. In movies like this directors and writers often allow the actors to improvise since they get into character so much. But not in this situation. Baumbach has thought every little thing through, every word, every touch and mimic has a meaning. He knew exactly what he wanted to deliver. Charlie's fall on the kitchen floor, the way Nicole talked walking away to the bathroom while first meeting her lawyer - all of these details are there for a reason. The obvious difference we are shown between Nicole - blowing her nose and looking a mess and Nora - strong, independent and flawless (that is what drove Nicole to her, because Nicole wanted to be a woman like that who was standing on her own feet and not living in the shadow of her brilliant husband). This project is very strong and holds its ground and that's the thought i was left with after the film ended.
I agree with some people - the ending left us in question. But some love stories are never over. And maybe those words that Charlie read about himself will change something, maybe their love will find its way back to them (there must have been a reason he finally moved to LA and she is successful on her own), or maybe they will just manage to stay friends and remain Henry's mom and dad forever. Nobody knows, it's for each of us to decide. But again, this is what sometimes we are left with in life - uncertainty, a little hope for a ""someday"".<br/><br/>I hope this film is appreciated and seen for what it is at all the awards and not overlooked because of political/racial/gender dominants that seem to only interest award shows these days."

","Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach is an extremely well observed portrayal of two people who once loved each other and are now going through the painfull and ugly process of separation and divorce with a son torn between them.<br/><br/>Thanks to the great script this process is shown in an impartial way where both sides are relatable. The acting by Driver and Johansson is phenomenal and arguably the best i have seen this year. They are nailing the quiet moments as well as the loud.<br/><br/>I only had some minor issues with the movie. I think some of the side characters like Charlies lawyer and some of the people working at the theater are stereotyped. Also the humor felt sometimes forced and out of place.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a pretty great movie and one of the best of 2019. If Ingmar Bergman is too bleak for you and Woody Allen too quirky, this movie sits right between them and you will love it."
"koustav_net","9","4","5","9 December 2019"," Honest, Raw & Heartfelt
","Marriage Story - Probably the most real, honest and heartfelt movie seen in this year.
I remember being completely smitten by Scarlett Johansson ever since I saw her in Woody Allen's Match Point, but, then again, never considered her to be anything more than a decent actor. And as for Adam Driver, never considered him anything. Probably, Logan Lucky was his only movie which I barely liked.
Had it not been for the glowing reviews, I might've skipped this one too.<br/><br/>So, despite MS not being my first choice to watch on a Friday Night, I reluctantly gave in to the reviews and was prepared as well to feel little underwhelmed with the final product, as it happens to me most of the time.<br/><br/>But this one got me from it's unconventional opening scene itself, where each of the character's voiceover sharing all the positive things about their respective partner that made them fall in love in the first place. And the movie begins.<br/><br/>Honestly, I never knew Scarlett Johansson can ACT and I mean ACT this good. Was simply blown away with the plethora of emotions she portrayed and that too without ever going over the top.<br/><br/>And, then there is Adam Driver, if Scarlett Johansson was great, then he was out of the world. His character was selfish, arrogant and demanding. And yet, never in the movie his flaws were sugarcoated to gulp down the audiences' throat. People are flawed and this movie is as real as it's characters. There's a scene where his character breaks down, and weeps uncontrollably with an equally broken down Johansson consoling him. That, to me, is the performance of the year. Then again, we have Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck as well this year.<br/><br/>This ultimately is the poignant tale of a NYC couple going through a divorce in LA and how they both cope up with the new changes, lawyers, courts, judges & dealing with their respective professions and still maintain their sanity for their only son, builds the simple premise.<br/><br/>Though I don't think the movie will find the appreciation from all corners as it's on a very serious subject devoid of any entertainment, but those, looking for really good and sensible dramas, should certainly look it up."

","Noah Baumbach's latest drama focuses on themes that will resonate with many as he delves into the emotional story of love and divorce, comparable with the Oscar winning Kramer Vs Kramer.
After an effective opening voiceover scene where both Charlie (Driver) & Nicole (Johansson) tell us why they love each other we are then jarringly dropped into a therapist's room where both protagonists are in the midst of their early divorce proceedings. As the divorce intensifies for the custody of their young son so did its impact on me. It takes a while for the fireworks to get going but once Laura Dern weaves her manipulative lawyer's web, removing the amicable intentions from both parties we then get a phenomenal performance from Adam Driver in quite possibly a career best performance as he tries to deal with the underhanded tactics from the lawyer. Johansson is also in fine form but this is undeniably Driver's film. A scene where they try and talk their predicament out amicably but spirals out of control into a slanging match of insults until the emotive conclusion was my favourite scene. Hard to watch but utterly compelling thanks to both lead actors.
My only negative was Azhy Robertson who played the son in the midst of the tug of war custody battle. He was excruciatingly annoying and unconvincing.
Marriage Story is crafted perfectly at the hands of Baumbach who knows how to give us family drama with his eyes shut (see The Squid & The Whale). One of the best dramas I've seen this year that made me shed a tear at the very end."

"Mengedegna","3","80","184","6 October 2019"," More Neil Simon than Bergman, or even Woody Allen
","Seen 10/07/19 at the NYFF.<br/><br/>As with other Baumbach films, ""Marriage Story"" is long on talk and short on cinema, which makes it a strange choice for a featured spot in this year's NY Film Festival, especially since it is the second film on the main slate about a director, in this case a theatre director instead of a filmmaker, but still... I, for one, have limited tolerance for films or plays about directors on novels about novelists, etc. These have a higher burden than others to meet in convincing me that I should care about them. In the case of this year's film director's film about, very transparently, himself, Pedro AlmodÃ³var's ""Pain and Passion"" passes the test with ease, as it is glorious cinema. ""Marriage Story"", though, is more Neil Simon that Bergman (despite the aspirational allusion in the title and in a brief visual shout-out to ""Scenes From a Marriage""), or even Woody Allen, who is just as wordy but makes better cinema, at least in his older and better films. With its sorta jokey NY/LA rivalry theme, and in certain LA frames, ""Annie Hall"" also appears to be evoked here, but the mere mention of these films highlights the weakness of this one.<br/><br/>There is some, passing enjoyment to be had. Scarlett Johansson is, as always, radiant and holds the screen in ways that few of today's female leads can do - she needs to find directors who can make more of that. Laura Dern turns in a stellar performance as a vicious divorce lawyer camouflaged in California unctuousness, and there are some fine cameos from Roy Liotta, Alan Alda, the great Wallace Shawn, and others. (On the other hand, Johansson's husband/foil, Adam Driver, is as bland and uninteresting to watch while he forces himself to emote as anyone I've seen lately this side of a TV sitcom.) But Baumbach remains firmly within his milieu of affluent, if not wealthy, Brooklyn and LA showbiz people and their neuroses. It's all very narcissistic and more than a little contrived -- as I say, this is more theatre, with its elborate, paced plotting intended as build-up to the leads' Big Scene, which here tears up the scenery - literally - to no great effect.<br/><br/>Baubach in fact makes what I'm sure is an unforced error in a courtroom scene where, for the first time, ordinary (and diverse) Angelinos are seen waiting their turn before a judge, who makes a welcome comment to the effect that he is adjourning the case around which the film revolves as there are plenty of people with far fewer resources awaiting their turn. Indeed. And so the inevitable question arises: why, in 2019, should we care about these particular white, privileged, affluent, undoubtedly smart, but politically and socially obtuse people as they go through the predictable phases in the break-up of a marriage whose reality was never very convincing to begin with? Why should we spend our time watching what amounts to a modernized version of an old-fashioned drawing-room comedy, updated to take account certain contemporary sensibilities, particularly of the feminist sort?<br/><br/>Like many of the other films shown this year NYFF (and of many more that are not), the main producers here are Netflix, which is rapidly carving out a place for itself in American cinema comparable to that played by the Canal+ cable network in France. Though its support to quality cinema is welcome (Scorsese's ""The Irishman"", but also documentaries like the terrific ""An American Factory""...), there must be concern about how long it will allow its productions to run in proper cinemas before they disappear into the streaming ether. In most cases, that would be a huge loss for potential viewers, as films like these demand to be seen on a big screen. In the case of ""Marriage Story"", though, there will be little loss: it contains so little that is gripping from a cinematic point-of-view that it will do just fine on a flat screen on an iPhone.
If you do watch this film, try to imagine what would be left if you turned off the dialogue. It would almost certainly become clear that you're dealing with filmed theatre, not cinema. A single image from the following night's NYFF feature, Joon-Ho Boong's breathtaking ""Parasite"" is worth 10,000 of this dreary film's many, many words."

","I've always found both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver kinda cold and there are parts of Marriage Story that feel like that. Two people working successfully in the theatre.

A complicated relationship, that she's wants out of, he doesn't and neither does her mother, sister, theatre company, because they don't see what she sees. 8 year old Henry is caught in the middle, except he's not really. Despite going through a divorce they still like each other, respect each other, want to make it amicable, but their lives around them are what causes the complications, namely lawyers. What is it with Americans and lawyers? Anyway, neither Johansson or Driver are cold here, the world around them is, caricatured even, infectious negativity, but they are the warm, sincere, beating heart of this really sad film. It's heartbreaking and painful to watch as they try to navigate their way through this difficult time and frustrating that they don't help themselves, despite seeming more than capable.

It deals with such a complicated period in a families lives in such a masterful way. It is grounded in brutal reality, but manages to evoke a sense of something etherial. It exposes the harsh reality of marriage, while simultaneously being a commentary on humanity and love at large.

","It's rare that films come along like 'Marriage Story' that are so natural and well made that you don't even feel like you're watching a movie, you feel like you're watching real people in real life. Everything about this film, the acting, the writing, the direction, all combine to create something quite masterful. Every hand this movie tries itself at it nails. Whether it is trying to be funny, heart-breaking or thought-provoking, it always gets it right. This is a really good movie.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and Laura Dern have all been nominated for Academy Awards in their respective acting categories. They all gave masterful performances and deserve the genuine shot at winning they all have. Best Supporting Actress is always the weakest category and it typically tends to come down to who gets the most screen time, so I suspect Dern will take home the statue. The other two suffer from having very strong performances to compete against and so both may come up short. I would be happy to see either of them cause the upset though because they are excellent in this film.<br/><br/>'Marriage Story' is told in a way which asks you to side with either the man or the woman. I would be very interested to poll people on this movie and see who they sided with and thought was being more reasonable. It's a tough one but I know I sided with Driver's character a lot more. Whether men tend to side with the man and women with the woman, or not, I'd be interested to know.<br/><br/>The thing I was most shocked about was how funny the film was able to be. Sometimes it was just a random line that cracked me up, sometimes it was an entire scene. There is a scene between Driver and Martha Kelly that had me in stitches.

"robfollower","9","5","7","1 February 2020"," Review: ""Marriage Story"" 9.5 /10
","With ""Marriage Story,"" Writer/director Noah Baumbach goes to a dark place to assess the end of a life shared by two unhappy people, taking over two hours of screentime to assess the difficulties of a specifically challenged marital union.
""Marriage Story"" is richly detailed, tastefully balanced with some needed comedy, and consistently attentive to the inner lives of the lead characters, who endure all the dehumanization of the divorce process in America. And yet, through the gloom and rising anxiety, Baumbach always preserves the heart of the moment, fleshing out the struggle of legal and emotional separation.<br/><br/>The film stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta co-star.<br/><br/>Johansson locates surprising areas of honesty for the character, working wonderfully with Baumbach's observant screenplay. Johansson plays an interesting foil, so long in the shadow of her high-profile husband despite being the face of his success in many ways. You can see the pain on her face, but it slowly turns defiant as she discovers a new life and a new (or perhaps rediscovered) sense of self in California. Her performance is Sublime.<br/><br/>Driver has grown into one of the most respected actors of his generation a fearless and magnetic screen presence capable of making you believe everything he's saying no matter the context. He spends much of the film in a bemused haze as their divorce proceedings turn from civil to contentious, unable to understand how things went so sour despite his role in fracturing their relationship. It's the sort of skillful and soulful performance that's expected of him now, and he doesn't disappoint. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their performances sell the emotion of the script with ease.<br/><br/>While Driver and Johansson take up most of the space in the room, there's still enough oxygen for some fun and quirky supporting turns, be it Wallace Shawn's unfathomably horny thespian or Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother, respectively. But it's Dern, decked out in slinky, aggressive power dresses and extreme heels, who effortlessly steals the movie away whenever she enters a scene. She has great fun sparring with Liotta and Alan Alda (as a grandfatherly and mostly inept lawyer who may not be up for the job. ""Marriage Story"" is all about its performances, and those performances are flawless in every sense of the term.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" manages to come out on the other side with a sense of calm and understanding, making an extraordinarily difficult viewing experience worth the pain to see how people can keep living even when life is determined to beat all the spirit out of you. The result is a near-perfect piece of transcendent art and one of the true standouts of 2019. 9.5/10"

If you imagine perfect marriage that does not exist this is the best next thing to that and we are able to see it from both eyes of him and her. It's crazy how much hurt can bring you things that you love and how much love can bring you things that hurt. Seems like paradox but eventually it is what it is and Marriage Story is all of that and much more.<br/><br/>Measures and distances that humans are willing to go and fight for just increase with love and that is what this movie is trying to portray and it absolutely did. Directing by Noah is also pretty interesting to watch as he takes some different approaches to give us sense of distance and loneliness, on the other side closeness and love. It absolutely is drama filled with emotions but after you end the movie there is a big appreciation for those humorous scenes that made you laugh even though consciousness is hitting you like, It's bad, This is sad, Don't forget what you are watching and then you are back to sadness that this story is giving you all along.<br/><br/>Let's just say that Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are so beautifully great and keep pulling you to each side with their emotional roller coaster that Noah has put them on and they deserve all praises for their performance.

","This is a movie about being performative. Sure, actors do that all the time. But in this case the main characters are performing artists who can't recognize it in themselves. Are they saying what they really feel, or are they giving a performance? The divorce lawyers certainly do. And once they get involved one performance begets another until it spools out of control. A movie that demands introspection from the audience and will give as good as it gets."

","I loved the movie. I don't need to say much about it, the movie is great. Is great directed, it has an awesome score, an amazing screenplay, and two insanely good performances. That's the main highlight for me tho, besides all the other great stuff, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson just kill it in the movie.<br/><br/>My God, they are such talent actors, and they give them all here. I've been following Adam's career since he got cast as Kylo Ren, and I have yet to see a movie where he isn't good in it, the guy is a freaking monster. I think is fair to say I've seen less of Scarlett's work besides the Marvel films, but still, I know she is great for movies like Hail, Cesar, or Her for example. Anyways, the point is they are both insanely great in the movie.<br/><br/>What helps both actors is that characters are incredible well written, they feel like real people, with flaws, and the movie takes its time to let you know them, see their side of the story, and that helps a lot, the material they have to work with is great.<br/><br/>One thing that I didn't see a lot of people talking about is the score. Man, I love almost every musical bit in the movie (besides one of the last fell ones, that's actually performed by Adam Driver, which a thought was... weird, at best). The score overall is flawless tho. It adds a lot to the movie itself.<br/><br/>I talk to a friend about it, and he said he thought the movie didn't have a ""message"", besides showing kind of how a marriage process works. I disagree tho. I think the movie's main message it's not exactly about that, I think the movie shows how connected your life is to another person when you married, and consequently, how difficult is to ""disconnect"", and mainly, that love is... weird, and it doesn't need vanish, after the divorce, you had a strong feeling for that person at one point, and she/he was a crucial part of your life, you'll probably still feel something afterwards, some form of love... and that's beautiful!<br/><br/>Idk, I haven't been married at this point, so I guess I'm not the most adequate person to talk about the subject, regardless, that was my take on it.<br/><br/>9,5/10"
"tangsisius","10","5","7","3 January 2020"," This is a good movie that push you to rethink about relationship, marriage and divorce.
","Marriage Story was definitely the best movie I've watched over the past year. I've never got married, had a kid, or divorced. But after watching this movie, it makes me feel like I have gone through the entire struggling, painful process. There are no dramas throughout the movie, rather, all the stories sounds real, normal and could happen to any married couple that are trying to get divorced. Time is always cruel and powerful: It can set apart a couple, who used to love each other deeply and exclusively, and now make them fight against each other, (with the help of each's lawyer) , for money, assets and custody of children. All these changes don't take too long - just in few years. In the movie, Charlie (the husband) and Nicole ( the wife) had a very intensive fight for over 15 minutes, I was impressed by how angry, unsatisfied, nagging they were. Those negative emotion, that had been suppressed and controlled for years had finally exploded and became devastating. They used the most harsh words to hurt each other. The husband even said he wanted the wife to die. Not surprisingly, they finally divorced. But I was very sad about the ending of the story. They could have had a happy family, watching their kid grow up together, but they terminated it because of disputes on chores and small things in lives. Had they communicated their negative emotion timely and thoroughly whenever the issue arose, and weren't leave it accumulated, a divorce can be avoided. But it was too late to say this. Nicole had already started her new life in LA with her boyfriend. A divorce was already a divorce, nothing can get back. What I've learned is: life won't give you a chance to regret, and move backward. A broken heart will never be healed completely. You have to move on to embrace your new life, And let the past be an unforgettable memory. I highly recommend this movie, because it gives you a good chance to rethink about marriage, life and divorce."

"CineMuseFilms","8","5","7","28 December 2019"," A witty and sad portrait of modern marriage
","It is refreshing to see a film that can both warmly respect and ruthlessly dissect the institution of marriage. While every marriage is unique, there are universal scenarios that can signal their demise. Two of these are central to Marriage Story (2019): the film forensically examines what happens when one partner's ego swallows another, then shows the destructive force that is unleashed when lawyers come between otherwise still-caring partners.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple, linear, and dialogue-heavy. In the opening minutes we see respected theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) and his increasingly successful actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) in the middle of a marital mediation session. He is opening a new play on Broadway while she will be taking their young son to Los Angeles to star in a TV pilot. The session stalls despite their obvious regard for each other and their commitment to avoid lawyers in a marriage split.<br/><br/>Classic marital tension lines become palpably clear. Charlie and Nicole met when he was a high-profile director and she a theatre novice, and this imbalance of egos remain embedded in all aspects of their relationship. Although a loving father, the self-absorbed Charlie had an affair which is now being weaponised as she asserts her identity and needs. She decides to engage a lawyer forcing him to follow suit or lose custody of their young son; the communication drawbridge is pulled up as the lawyers amplify every marital issue into a war cry on an ever more blood-splattered battlefield.<br/><br/>Nothing new here, you might say, except for two bright lights in a dark place: Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. He is perfect in playing the broad faced deer-in-the-spotlight hapless male, confused over his marital and parental mess-ups...but he sings a beautiful song. She is brilliant in playing a wife no longer willing to be invisible despite still loving the man she married. An ensemble of lawyers include a benignly caring advisor (Alan Alda) and ruthless warriors who take no prisoners (Laura Dern and Ray Liotta).<br/><br/>You don't need to be a divorce voyeur to find this well-trodden story highly absorbing, mostly because the two stars make it hard to take sides. Charlie's weaknesses are not unforgiveable and his love for his son and wife continue. Nicole has a right to her own independent future but still feels strongly about him. If lawyers were not involved, things could be very different. Marriage Story is an insightful, witty, and sad portrait of how easily a marital fairytale can turn to a nightmare."
"harrylosborne","8","5","7","28 December 2019"," Authentic performances in the best screenplay of 2019
","Director Noah Baumbach has created a beautiful piece of cinema with Marriage Story. A heartfelt and honest retelling of a divorce between two patrons of theatre, the dance between leads Adam Driver (Charlie) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole) is captivating cinema. Their interactions span quiet conversation to explosive argumentation, and they move seamlessly between the two thanks to a razor sharp script. The real art, however, is the infused comedic elements: they are subtle and disguised, but are welcome in snapping the viewer back to the realities of each situation.<br/><br/>The couple's lives are a myriad of compromises that increase in complexity: whether to live in NYC or LA, who their young son Henry should stay with, and who's career prospects warrants the next jump into the unknown. Their divorce proceedings are amicable to begin, but external parties circumstances muddy the waters and soon every detail is scrutinised and manipulated. Watching the divorce lawyers have the argument they themselves cannot wrestle with is a bizarre concept, but shows the soullessness that breaking up a marriage can require; on top of this, the lawyers know nothing between them is personal, but that couldn't be further from the truth for Charlie and Nicole.<br/><br/>The leads (and, indeed, the majority of the cast) are superb in their casting and performances. Adam Driver is already an actor I hold in very high regard - his flexibility and comedic qualities are a true gift, but his compassion and anger when acting are so believable. I feel some remorse for Johansson, in that she is largely known for her one-dimensional requirements to play Black Widow in the Marvel franchise, but this sort of work demonstrates her real talent in more weighty roles. The snap of the script is made even more impressive by knowing that virtually nothing is improvised - Baumbach has their hesitations and outbursts orchestrated to the finest details.<br/><br/>Cinematographically, Marriage Story uses unique angles and environmental features to accentuate each shot and the feelings conveyed: the attitudes of the arthouse couple inspire these frames, where open plan rooms alongside continuous shots are effectively used. Some scenes are also filmed with shallow depths of field to make the subject sharp and resolute, a technique given additional power by the grainy effect applied to the footage. Classical compositions often accompany the emotion of the moment, but some scenes are bereft of music to let the viewer decide the mood for themselves.<br/><br/>Baumbach's directorial methodology might be painstaking, but the rewards are clear to see. His vision is infectious, and he demonstrates such a unique style that, even if you cannot empathise with the story from personal experience, you become drawn in. Both Driver and Johannson may be in line for some heavyweight nominations come awards season, and any victories would be, in my book, wholly justified."

"desmondchan-02178","9","5","7","22 December 2019"," Love, marriage & divorce
","In one of the film's poignant scenes, theatrical director Charlie Barber (Driver) belted Stephen Sondheim's 'Being Alive' after an acrimonious divorce court tussle left him wounded and exhausted, ""But alone is alone. Not alive."" The irony is stark when his wife (Johansson) parted ways because she could not feel 'alive' as her dreams in LA are smothered by Charlie's ego and work, where her frustrations are drily vented through Sondheim's other number 'You could drive a person crazy'. The acerbic wit is reminiscent of a Woody Allen movie, but Noah Baumbach's nuanced dissection of the emotional upheavals in a divorce and the bitterness in fighting for custody is gut-wrenchingly raw and humanistic. While Johansson galvanizes with visceral angst and grief from her personal experiences, Driver's performance carries not one false note as he navigates the pain of connecting with his son and coming to terms with his flaws. Laura Dern channels Renata Klein as a divorce attorney, who gives the story a feminist edge with a snarky take on how mothers are expected to be perfect. Together with the solid supporting cast including the bullish Ray Liotta and the wry Alan Alda - along with Randy Newman's romantic score, this union lifts Marriage Story to be a tender and affecting portrait of the complexities of co-parenting, of how we can begin our relationships with love - and end them with grace."

","This is a story about relationships, personal struggles, and the sacrifices one makes for their significant other. A raw and emotional tale from the mind of Noah Baumbach. The movie follows two characters, Charlie and Nicole Barber, played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson respectively. Both characters are complex and flawed, each of them experience their own problems as they go through the process of divorce. I think the movie is flawless and executed masterfully, in terms of direction. I couldn't really find a flaw, maybe a few nitpicks here and there, but most of the time I was glued to the screen because of how well-acted the characters are and how engaging the story is. Dramas tend to be sappy and melodramatic, this movie feels real. This film explores the messy legal side of divorce where all bets are off and everything is a free-for-all, as well as the touching moments between child and parent. You feel for these characters and you want both of them to come out on top. To evoke such emotions is the hallmark of an amazing film. There are intense emotional scenes that just drains you and makes you empathetic towards the characters. There are also calm and moody scenes that makes you reflect on the characters and the journey they undertook. The music was great, very melodic and nice for the ears to listen to. It fits very well in the movie and serves as to set up the tone of certain scenes, establishing a mood and calmness in the audience. Felt very early 2000's, and the movie does have an early 2000's vibe with its aspect ratio and how the story is presented. In my opinion, this film totally deserves the award claims it is getting, it is an emotional, heartfelt character driven story and I totally recommend it if you have the time or in the mood to cry.

Charlie and Nicole are fantastic protagonists. Their initial love (so evident in Nicole's recollection), followed by the busy everyday life leading to 'typical' marital pitfalls... and then the interesting ending.<br/><br/>I loved how both, Scarlett and Adam were able to portray the whole range of emotions. When they loved each other, it was so beautifully gentle and touching and when they were at each other's throats the hatred was literally palpable.
For me, the absolute pinnacle was the 'dialogue' between the two in Charlie's house. I literally held my breath and was emotionally wrecked by the end of it. Resentful Nicole versus genuinely confused and angry Charlie - masterclass.<br/><br/>On a different note, as a parent, I am immensely grateful for portraying a family time as one spent around good old fashioned Monopoly (rather than Nintendo wii and such like)."

Once things have turned from bad to worse, the dignity, the face, the whatever would suddenly become so important, so they and everybody started to hurt each other, and the lawyers they hired were circling like vultures and vampires, they smelled blood from a rotten corpse of a marriage, grasped any piece of the rotten meat they could snatch.<br/><br/>A once a perfectly synchronized couple, a normal Papa, Mama and kid family was then tore apart. All the intolerance, compromises, niceties, love and good memories were tossed out of the window, the home and the negotiation desk presided by lawyers on both sides became the battlefield. The husband, the wife and especially their kid, became the casualties, the wounds were so deep and wide open, no ambulance could save them in time; they were all the modern day victims from a broken family, not from the gunshot of bullets, but unspeakable, indescribable of all shortcomings as a human, inconciliable, uncompatile, inconciliables blind fury and stubbornness. They were manipulated by their own lawyer to attack, to hurt and retaliate before they were attacked or hurt by the person who sat on the opposite of the negotiation table.<br/><br/>My wife told me after she watched this movie: ""Marriage, in the end, only means when you become old, there's someone beside you, a company who dine with you, to take a walk with you, to check on you at night to see if you are still breathing, to accompany you to see the doctor, to pick up your medicine refills for you. The most miserable thing that could ever happen to you is you eat alone, sleep alone; even for the purpose of more peaceful and undisturbed reason, you both decided to sleep in a separate room. I can only say for myself that EATING ALONE, SITTING ALONE and TALKING ONLY TO YOURSELF are the most miserable, pathetic and hopeless things that you have to face and deal with it when you become old. Marriage, is just finding a lifelong person to accompany you when you become old.""<br/><br/>And I have to add just one more line: ""Forget about your kids, your siblings, your....They are just irrelevant 3rd Parties."""

","The acting and writing stand out in particular with this movie, and after watching several other baumbach films I think it might be his best in both those departments. The movie is tragic and honest and it doesn't over simplify things like most of these movies. Nothings black and white, and Scar Joe and Driver do alot in there roles to help promote that feeling. Both of the leads deserve oscar noms and honestly Drivers my front runner for best actor right now. Honestly it's great and everyone should see it."

","Marriage Story is a haunting and emotionally devastating tale of a divorce. It portrays the pain of two involved souls during the process. It is raw and real, it hits you hard and effectively. The only message Marriage Story is trying to convey is that, divorce is horrible, stay away from it.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach has created this film with utter perfection. It is a very personal film for him since it is somewhat based on his own divorce. He took it seriously and created a masterpiece. Marriage Story features two of the finest performances of this year and maybe, even of this decade. Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver are heartbreaking. They make you laugh with them, they make you sob with them. In that ""Argument"" scene, and you'll hear about this scene very often for a while, because it is incredible. The finest piece of filmmaking, it is so real and natural and emotional, I was having a hard time while watching it. It was heart-rending, thanks to Adam and Scarlet for their impeccable acting.<br/><br/>Marriage Story does not start as an alluring tale of love and then goes to a sad mode. It starts with melancholy and ends with melancholy. In very beginning of the movie, there's that scene when Nicole and Charlie are having a normal chat post-sepration decision, they're talking about this theatre play of theirs and as soon as Nicole leaves Charlie's sight, she crumbles, break into tears and that was painful to watch. That is my personal favorite scene from the movie. There's one monologue about six minutes log, all in one take, where Scarlet Johansson is touching every possible emotion, she's walking, crying, sniffing, sobbing, eating, giving complements about what she eats, I don't know how many take it too her but this is a remarkable achievement. I've never rated Scarlet Johansson very high as an actress but she surprised me here and same goes for Adam Driver.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach made this film around a divorce, a very poignant situation. But there's no melodrama or other gimmicks, it is just so natural and real. These two people are against each other, but Noah approached this story with a very neutral eye. No one is the villain here, this man and woman are equally responsible for what they are going through. Noah does not want you to judge but rather empathize these characters.<br/><br/>Film's screenplay is very well written, despite not being a high octane thriller, this sophisticated drama keeps you tied up with the seat. Screenplay gives you some light hearted moments, moments you'll laugh at. Unexpectedly this is quite funny when it wants to be.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is going to be a front-runner in every department this coming Oscars season, I loved Joaquin Phoenix in joker and thought he could be a sure shot winner, but now I think it's not going to be that easy."
"chickmcfresh","10","5","7","8 December 2019"," This is True Grit
","Its devastating and beautiful. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver deliver this masterpiece by the exquisite direction of Noah Baumbach. From start to finish every scene captivates the true essence of marriage. The sacrifices made for love and the gut wrenching sorrow experienced of having to face our own flaws are expressed with emotion so raw it will leave you speechless. Baumbachs genius is tantilizing and fluid as he navigates the viewer through what may seem a bland backdrop to let the actors talent shine. The fight scene will without a doubt go down in cinematic history as one of the best scenes of any movie ever made.<br/><br/>If you are married you should see this movie. If you are not married you should see this movie. If you are single or breathing you should see this movie. Because it's not about the status. Its about two humans navigating this messy, unpredictable, world in a way so honest it will remind you of yourself in the deepest ways you couldn't even imagine."
"AIOS-Reviews","10","5","7","8 December 2019"," Marriage Story is one of the most accurately deep and intimate view over a separation.
","I've not waited for this much for any other movie from this year. Marriage Story entertained me in all the way it could. So beautifully and accurately portrayed a separation between two characters (Charlie and Nicole) this movie is going to be staying with me for a very long time. And why this divorce story is titled Marriage Story you need to have a look. From the very beginning seeing the couples have been writing about each other, my eyes got struck. But then it turns out they are on their divorce phrase and they are being told to write about each other in front of a marriage counselor. But Nicole doesn't seem to like what she has just written. So usually she gets angry and gets out of the room.<br/><br/>That's how the movie starts. And then it goes deeper through the characters and gives us reasons for the causing and it looks like, that million other divorce cases. 'A Separation', 'Revolutionary Road' or 'Before Midnight' there are a lot of movies made of this same category. But Marriage Story is surely one of the greatest of them. It moves us from the deep inside. It is relatable even if you've never been married but has gone through a breakup. It too looks deep into a couples and their internal issues. The huge fight scene at the end gave me chills just like those fight scenes in Revolutionary Road and Before Midnight.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is so well written and personally, I don't want anything more from a movie. I just want a movie that needs to be about people like us and they have to face situations like ours. And Marriage Story is definitely the film to relate our-selves at any phase of our lives. Also, what I want to say is that the screenplay is the most important part of a film and Noah Baumbach did it very well here. The dialogues, they are accurate, like what real people would say. Some moments, so beautifully written to fill our hearts and that's enough for me to give a film full 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>The performance from Scarlett Johansson probably is so far the best of her career. And I would definitely say the performance of Adam Driver here is nothing less than Joaquin Phoenix in 'Joker'. Above all, Marriage Story is an emotional journey about two individuals, who were supposed to be together is splitting up. Not just depressing or sad the movie has its moments on comedy too and it's beautiful to look at, nice to listen to and deep to take in."

","A highly emotional ride which I didn't know would hit this hard. It made me cry too, which is rare for a movie to do that. It was intense and subtly detailed, with great dialogues, heart-wrenching scenes, Oscar-worthy performances and overall a great piece of Cinema.<br/><br/>You should see it, it doesn't disappoint!"
"asen-75377","8","5","7","7 December 2019"," Baumbach's best work till date...a perfect movie about divorce
","Marriage Story isn't necessarily a tragedy about a relationship; it's about the divorce and how it can poison whatever noble intentions the involved parties had about remaining amicable.<br/><br/>This movie shows the struggle,pain and how the couples put themselves to their extremes when they go through a divorce..after all this movie is heart-rending but it also has a comedic touch. Noah Baumbach's Marriage story is a insightful and solicitous look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson gave her career best performance I think ..Adam Driver's performance is terrific and probably most notable,as he plays every card in his deck. His rendition of 'being alive' is movie's real standout moment...definitely the frontrunner along with Joaquin Phoenix for Best actor category in Oscars. The other supporting casts had also done a great job.<br/><br/>Perfect movie of the year and definitely worthy of your time."
"kaydee-67506","2","30","63","18 December 2019"," Crap story - bad dialogue - selfish, vindictive mother/wife - clearly pushing agenda
","The filmmakers clearly want you to like and identify with Nicole, but no. She is so selfish, flaky, dishonest, and vindictive it just makes you cringe and feel sorry for her husband and son who is clearly being treated terribly. I can't believe people watch this and think it is ""heartwarming"" - That is scary and sad for our society."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","58","132","6 December 2019"," Generic, mediocre, blend, stereotyped boring
","I've tried my best to watch this movie, but simply couldn't keep my focus and attention to this badly scripted, non-creative directing, bad scenario and bad cast. I specifically didn't like the narrations from the both sides or either side of the married couple. I think if a movie needs narration to help it going, then it'd be such mediocre way to make a movie. A movie should not use some lame method as an audio book, if you need the actors to stand on the sideline to narrate and at the same time to act, that's just stupid. It only exposed how mediocre the screenplay writers are. The narration or talking-to-himself -or-herself formula is widely used in the Korean movies. Instead of acting, they used talking to himself or herself to tell the audiences what they were thinking. Narration, likewise, should only used in documentary films, for commercial movies with virtual characters, narration method should be the less the better.<br/><br/>I also didn't quite like the male leading actor who actually looked quite dumb and his voice quality was just terrible. I don't know such a mediocre actor would have become a quite hot commodity recently. He just looked dumb, there's nothing on that face could allow me to accept all the roles he played in his recent movies. He just couldn't melt, mix and transform himself into all of the roles he played. He is always HE but not the roles he played.<br/><br/>This movie also telling me one thing: Time flies and flies so fast. The leading female actor was once so lovely, young and energetic, but now, she seems suddenly transformed into a tired, spiritless middle aged woman and a very plain one; a very tired face to look at.<br/><br/>This is a terribly scripted and poorly directed movie. The casting job is also terrible; so many old faces appeared in this movie and none of them just couldn't give me any realistic feeling of the roles they played. Their long existences in the Hollywood movie industries have already nullified their acting, no matter what roles they played in any movie, they just looked the same. Not quite understand what I said here? Well, go see ""The Irishman"" and ""The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)"", watch those old actors, all of them have become such formulaic and boring actors, no matter what kind of roles they played, they just used their stereotyped and trademarked, never changed acting formulas to waltz through all of the movies. They didn't transform themselves into those roles but only show their own selves again and again, the voice, the accent, the dialog, the body language, the facial expressions they delivered never changed.<br/><br/>Sadly, this actor who played the husband role in this movie has already given the doomed impression as those old actors, no matter what the roles he played, he just looked like He, an never changing image outside of the roles or characters he played. And he didn't even looked like a believable husband in this movie. A big mediocre blend plain face with Jackie Chan's outdated hairdo. ""No cheek will be left dry?"" Well, better have your eyes checked soonest.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, if you are really interested in the ""Divorce"" genre movies, besides ""Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)"" that one viewer have already recommended, ""Jodaeiye Nader az Simin - A Separation (2011)"" is an even better viewing experience. Or, if you prefer a 3rd kind of dramatic divorce story, try ""War of The Roses (1989)"", see how a divorce would become so ugly but with a guilty pleasure to watch. Don't forget to check out these movies first on IMDB.com"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","9","15","26 December 2019"," Life in ""Marriage Story""
","Not so ironically, Writer and Director Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" is about divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie Barber. They have a cute 8 year-old son Henry, played by resilient Azhy Robertson, who struggles with a learning disability.<br/><br/>Charlie is the intense copious note taking Director of avant-garde theater in New York. Nicole is the former teen sex comedy movie star, who forsakes Hollywood stardom to act in her husband Charlie's theatrical stage productions.<br/><br/>At the impasse in their marriage, Nicole accepts a TV series role in Los Angeles. She brings son Henry with her to Los Angeles, which is also home. Nicole lives with her Mom Sandra, played by whimsically wise Julie Hagerty, at her parents' home. Mom was the former Hollywood actress. Apparently, her late husband, Nicole's Father, was gay. Hence, that marriage also ended in divorce.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Charlie grew up in the Midwest, raised by abusive alcoholic parents. So there's that. Although, Charlie occurs as rather anal retentive, controlling, he's a good kind man. Sandra loves him like a son. He's the good father. Perhaps, not the good husband. Apparently, he had an affair with his stage manager. Rather, Charlie might not be the good husband to Nicole.<br/><br/>While in Los Angeles, Nicole hooks up with prominent divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, played with charming ferocity by Laura Dern. Nora reassures Nicole, ""What you're doing is an act of hope."" She seems to have genuine compassion for Nicole's suffering.<br/><br/>Yet, clearly Nora has her own cause: ""The idea of a good father was only invented 30 years ago..."" Apparently, Nora has been deeply hurt from her own past marriage. So it's really not about Nicole. It's all about Nora. Just saying.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Charlie and Nicole work with their marriage Mediator. They're getting divorced. Each holds a letter that they wrote about what they love about the other. Director Noah brilliantly opens in flashbacks of Nicole and Charlie's life together, with Scarlett and Adam in narration. Clearly, Nicole and Adam love each other, are good parents, but perhaps, are no longer in love with each other.<br/><br/>In the heart wrenching arc of ""Marriage Story"", Nicole tells Charlie that she no longer loves him, that she hates him, what he stands for. Angry Charlie screams, ""I want you dead!"" You see the sadness in Nicole's eyes. You witness the suffering in Charlie's eyes. I cried. Charlie literally drops to his knees.<br/><br/>Yes, Charlie crossed the line. Yes, he was enraged. Yet, he occurred more wounded than angry. He was terrified that he lost the love of his life. That he lost Nicole. That's the profound humanity and brave vulnerability of Noah's ""Marriage Story"". No, Nicole and Charlie are not bad, people, who deserved what happened. Rather, life happened. Sometimes, life doesn't turn out the way we hoped, even with our best intentions. In this touching humanity Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are sublime.<br/><br/>Early on, when talking with her attorney Nora, Scarlett's Nicole said that she ""got small"" with Charlie, that somehow her life got marginalized. Scarlett is so authentic, so courageous in her words and in her silence. Yes, she loves Charlie, but that hurts too much to continue to do so. Scarlett is awesome.<br/><br/>Adam is simply amazing. He makes bold, compelling choices playing Charlie. Whether he flippantly comments on Nicole's haircut or when he struggles with the child car seat in his rental. Yeah, he's imperfect, and he tries so hard to do his best, to be right. Adam is profoundly vulnerable in Charlie's distinct humanity.<br/><br/>In a scene with son Henry, Adam's Charlie remembers what made him fall madly and deeply in love with Scarlett's Nicole. There is beauty in imperfection, in their failed marriage. Life goes on. Yet, love is still the possibility. That's the power and poignancy of ""Marriage Story"". It's my very favorite movie of the year. Just saying."

","Marriage Story, directed & written by Noah Baumbach was a beautiful representation of the effects of a divorce. We got our time with Scarlett Johansson, to see her side, and then we got our time with Adam Driver, viewing his side. I liked the fact that there wasn't a clear-cut good guy, and a clear-cut bad guy; you can see and understand both of their sides.<br/><br/>The screenplay was so deep, and very relatable to the people who have been through such actions. Baumbach created a great emotional connection with the audience, backed up by award winning worthy preformances by both leads, in Driver & Johansson.

That said, it wasn't long before I was completely engrossed, it was like watching a work of art unfold before me. The acting, the directing, the music, they were all wonderful and I was especially blown away by Scarlett's performance. I've never seen her in this type of movie before and she really did a fantastic job. It was refreshing to see a divorce story that didn't focus on bitterness and anger, but on the love that still remained."
"abasu0819","10","6","9","7 March 2020"," Noah Baumbach's finest film till the date!
","Regrets held deep down the lane of emotions and ego can often lead to a larger impact than what is usually imaginable & Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story,"" a film with highs and as many lows, reflects the very realistic modern-day story of instinctive and very natural love alongside a forceful but understandable differences of opinions.<br/><br/>But as they say, no life is perfect. The very word of ""imperfection"" is an integral part of any human being. And Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) were no different. After years of marriage and a kid of 7-8 years age, Nicole finally decides to move on, citing the selfishness of a normal busy businessman Charlie. And that's where, with a simplistic plot coupled with great depth, the film starts to question your mindset and righteousness. It keeps deceiving the audiences throughout and boggles the minds with numerous scenes that may lead to an emotional attachment....... With two fictitious but highly relatable on screen characters. And then there were the bunch of lawyers, who Charlie even went onto call ""assholes,"" is a perfect example of all the troubles that couples face during the divorcing saga. But is the mental burden the end? No. How the entire society is impacted alongside your kid and how a relationship instinctively ends up lasting forever are well and truly showcased in the most appropriate manner possible in this film.<br/><br/>Credits to the the fantastic screenplay and even more fantastic direction of Noah Baumbach! But can we take away anything from the technical department? A huge no. The scoring by Randy Newman, cinematography by Robbie Ryan & editing by Jennifer Lame were top-tier. The usage of 35mm made the film looked more relatable than ever with all the actors looking much larger and closer, and therefore leaving a more mental impact. The off-white coloring helped capturing the essence of Los Angeles and New York alike magnificently. In the end, it was the spot-on dramatic background scoring which played a key-role throughout the film. Most importantly, the dialogue writing, supported by a wonderful yet compact cast selection, was on point. The way Noah Baumbach used metaphors via storybooks, body language and all held the artistical values within but the pace intact. Kudos to each one of the makers in the film for being able to deliver such a masterpiece!<br/><br/>All in all, Netflix's ""Marriage Story"" is definitely one of the finest divorce dramas ever and missing it is something I definitely won't be suggesting. Although, it may not be for everyone, partly due to slight bit of profanity and how the theme is adult-centric. But if you decide to watch - be sure to be prepared for an extraordinary emotional rollercoaster ride of lots of differences and other factors (relatable for many)!"

","With much acclaim and hype surrounding this film from critics including several different award nominations. Marriage Story is a Netflix production film and one of its most successful films to date receiving several Grammy nominations.<br/><br/>This movie is quite good and realistic portraying a couple going through a divorce dealing with living situations and cooperating time with their child. Part of the acclaim is how realistic the film appears and the dialogue is very sharp, witty and serves a purpose. The characters (specially Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) are very life-like and feel like real people. We could see the emotion in their deliveries as both actors seem heavily invested in their roles. A lot of it had to do with the acting as well as the writing.<br/><br/>One thing which have seen much acclaim from is by the apparent tear jerker reactions. Audiences claiming how depressing or how people were overly crying while watching this movie. Do not agree as this movie is far more tame than expected. It is a heavy and serious topic but there are many light moments. Compared to Blue Valentine, which it has received many comparisons to. There are similarities but Blue Valentine feels more depressing, emotionally movie and powerful.<br/><br/>As a whole Marriage Story is well good but perhaps slightly over hyped. Although it did make one think about real life issues and different situations upon watching the movie."

"christian94","10","6","9","19 February 2020"," Best film of 2019
","I have seen 8 films of Noah's generally positive and thought-provocative filmography and considered While We're Young and The Squid and the Whale are his best, until this gem came along.<br/><br/>The Squid and the Whale also looks at a family going through divorce and is very effective.
Marriage Story's screenplay is however so realistic, depressing, funny and dynamic even in limited range of events that is surpasses all expectations. The directing is precise and highlights all the mixed emotions, conundrums and contradictions. The couple's inner conscious and subconscious life as opposed to their demeanors and actions are so spot on. The acting by the two leads are spectacular. They both got nominated for Oscars and Golden Globes. I personally think Scarlett should have won. Even if Adam may have been bested by Joachim, the magic of seeing both of them interact against each other in a few key scenes including the most intense one is what makes it an outstanding piece. Laura Dern's delicious take on the smart, seductive,cut-throat lawyer is deserving to win both Oscar and Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress. The legal aspects of the divorce are both frustrating and comical. They are costly in money but also in humanity. It gets ugly and probably worse in real life.<br/><br/>The film and screenplay were also both nominated for both top awards. There is not much better made films about relationships falling apart ever made. There is a nod in the film to seminal Scenes from a Marriage masterpiece by Bergman and perhaps Farhadi's A Separation also comes closest to represent this harsh reality.<br/><br/>This film is almost too close for comfort for anyone who has lived a similar separation as a child or a part of the couple. It feels real and emphasises, without direct finger-pointing, the lack of judgement, love, humanity and humility. When the separation starts to spin out of control, both inner and outer forces seem to be pulling in all directions and wrecking often irreparable destruction.<br/><br/>A fine film and fair warning.<br/><br/>Wishing you all a happy and long-lasting marriage."
"sebastianschlicht","10","6","9","14 February 2020"," An inconspicuous film with big impact and great actors!
","Under the direction of Noah Baumbach, the highly acclaimed love drama ""Marriage Story"" was created in 2019 and won an Academy Award for best supporting actress (Laura Dern). At first it seems that the focus is just on two great actors, but ""Marriage Story"" is so much more ...<br/><br/>Nicole and Charlie Barber are married, have a son, love the theater and want to get a divorce. The lives of both artists have changed and instead of clarifying the matter personally, Nicole hires a lawyer who makes the whole thing all the more complicated and difficult ...<br/><br/>A story that may not have much to offer on paper but is one of the most moving dramas in recent years. A film rarely feels so real and pure. But the enchanting thing about ""Marriage Story"" is that despite the divorce, there is a lot of romance and love to be seen in the film ... just in a different way. Adam Driver himself describes the film as a love film, despite the divorce issue. On the other hand, ""Marriage Story"" shows how scary such a divorce can be, even without the painful emotions! The lawyers do the talking, almost like in kindergarten, and you feel helpless. The film shows this helplessness in a real, but disturbing way. Nevertheless, despite the many difficult and sometimes tearsome topics, Baumbach manages to build wit and good humor into the story.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are the acting heart of this film. Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and the other supporting actors are all great, but it is Johansson and Driver who make ""Marriage Story"" what it is. Both have an incredible amount of chemistry and can shine with some great monologues. Nobody is the ""bad guy"", both are people with strengths and weaknesses and all actions of the two are understandable, which makes the arguments between the two so much more powerful.<br/><br/>Visually, the film does not impress with a breathtaking look, but the camera work by Robbie Ryan is very strong and often holds without cuts on the faces of the protagonists. Randy Newman's music also fits surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A must-see! ""Marriage Story"" is a rather unimpressive film compared to other masterpieces this year, but Noah Baumbach's film is moving, funny and sometimes hard to bear. And Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Oscar-worthy!"

Actress who, in a period of burnout, leaves her L.A. life and moves to New York where she meets, works with, and eventually marries Charlie.<br/><br/>Narration starts the story, where the two characters describe all that they love about each other while we see examples of those words depicted on screen. We then come to find that these ""narrations"" are actually the written words each has been asked to write about each other as they begin the process of divorce. A beautifully well crafted and concise way of introducing the characters, establishing their love for each other, and why they married without delaying the main focus of the story... the pains of divorce.<br/><br/>Charlie and Nicole wish to end things as peacefully as possible. However, self-interest (or perhaps a bit of self-preservation) for the lives each wish to live beyond marriage interfere with those goals. The process of divorce, particularly when custody of a child is involved, picks at the wounds that led to the divorce, making it easier to forget what people may have once loved about each other.<br/><br/>Most divorces are a result of paths going in different directions, realizations of things that you may not have seen during the infancy of a relationship. Careers, ambition, feelings of self-worth... they all come into play and are depicted as fuel for the gradual demise of their relationship.<br/><br/>Now, enter the many vultures that surround these two looking to divorce. Divorce attorneys that you almost feel have developed their approaches or styles, perhaps based on some bad divorce they, themselves, had gone through. They do not always seem to have their client's best interests in mind. Their aim to score the win for their client simply fans the fires of pain that may already be encircling the soon to be ex-couple.<br/><br/>Without going further into plot, the biggest success of this film is how each character is a sympathetic character but at the same time, guilty of sins that may have led to current events, signifying there is no ALL Good or ALL bad... no main villain.. but simply two people whose paths intersected at one point, met each other's needs for a time, then ultimately drifted in different directions.<br/><br/>At the center of all of this is their son, who clearly loves both mother and father, who has some connection issues due to distances between father and son, both geographically and emotionally. But through it all, the son serves as catalyst for the rising contentiousness of the interaction between mother and father as they fight for custody.<br/><br/>All told, the story progresses to a moment that showcases some of the best acting I've seen from BOTH actors to date.<br/><br/>I would love to comment on the ending but I hesitate, not because of spoilers, but because I almost feel that the uncertainty of how it ends is part of what gives the ending a satisfying feeling.<br/><br/>Not since Kramer vs Kramer has a film about divorce given such a painfully earnest look at divorce. Fair, yet honest, and, at times, emotionally gut wrenching look into divorce. This movie is a must see."

","Adam Driver deserves the Oscar win. He is the clear frontrunner imo.<br/><br/>The movie itself is really good, albeit with an unsatisfying ending.<br/><br/>I cried throughout the movie. It really hit me hard, as I can very much relate to the situations presented, particularly as my parents divorced when I was 2. All the pain and upheaval was well captured in this movie, especially by Adam Driver (one of my fav actors) who gives the performance of his career."
"nancyldraper","9","6","9","9 January 2020"," A Wonderful Movie
","This is a wonderful movie, not necessarily because of the subject matter (it's a difficult theme handled sensitively) but because of the careful. nuanced writing and superb performances (it was nominated for a Golden Globe in almost every dramatic acting category (as well as best picture, screenplay and soundtrack) and will probably stir up Oscar attention. Noah Baumbach is an incredible talent. (Just an aside, his work reminded me of another auteur of note these last couple of years, Greta Gerwig, and I was interested to discover that they have been partners in other projects). I will be paying more attention to his projects, from now on. Scarlett Johansson never misses a subtle distinction in a script, and her performance was flawless. But, then again, this was true of most of the cast. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama}"
"dylanrenner4","10","6","9","9 January 2020"," A Very Unique Story
","Of course I knew this was going to be a good film, but for the most part I was unsure what would make this film so special, unique, and good. The answer is that it's just a normal story of a family divorcing, and the parents trying to work it out with their child. The whole entire story is sort of depressing, because it focuses on the breaking of a family that was once strong. The first few minutes of the film start off with good vibes, but the rest is just full of hate, and dealing with their son and who wants to spend more time with their son. It's a simple idea, but nobody has ever been brave enough to show a story like this in a film, that's what makes it unique. It dives into the feelings that the parents have and the innocence of the child throughout this process. Another aspect of why this movie was so good, was the directing. Directing in small ways can really make or break a film, it defines what a film is and it can turn it into a piece of art. Throughout the film, there were several monologues that were crucial to the storyline and very emotional. As these were taking place, the camera would slowly zoom in, or it would not change its view to give the audience an outside look at what this character was really struggling with. The final piece of this movie that defined it for me was the acting. Both Adam Driver and Scarlatti Johansson were incredible. I was surprised because Laura Dern also did a great job. They all made us feel their emotion and made us want to help them in some way, it was truly amazing. A very unique experience."
"qiu_xinzhi","10","6","9","8 January 2020"," One of the best films of 2019
","This film is everything a Drama film should be. A terrifically conceived and directed film, Marriage Story dived deep into a story about a divorce and gave us an authentic look behind the love, hate, emotion and pain of the process. Buoyed by a superb performance from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, this film gave us the character depth one can only dream of. This is a must-see film not just of 2019, but I dare say, of all time."

","I'm finally getting caught up with the highly rated flicks of 2019 and this is another best of the bunch. Noah Baumbach's heartbreaking, genuine and unique examination of a normal couple going through divorce is without a doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. Scarlett Johansson delivering her second amazing performance of the year and the oddly sexy and powerful Adam Driver delivers a career high performance as her husband. Theres also a fine cast of supporting performances from Laura Dern and Ray Liotta amongst others. It's a truly powerful and realistic examination of the material that's explored in such a way that it resonates with you long after it's over from the powerful arguments to the subtle touches. But it's not all sad, it's joyous, heartwrenching and supremely engaging. I found myself absolutely captivated and honestly i didn't want it to end. I felt like I knew these people and I wanted to know what would happen in their future."

The time flew by as you were drawn into the Web they were sadly weaving courtey of money grabbing LA lawyers. The scene at the end where Driver reads his ex wife's notes about him is simply heartbreaking.

"hunter-friesen","8","6","9","17 December 2019"," ""Marriage Story"" hits home with laughter and tears
","""Divorce is like a death without a body.""<br/><br/>With nearly half of all marriages ending in divorce in America, this quote from Noah Baumbach's new film now rings truer than ever.<br/><br/>Debuting on Netflix, ""Marriage Story"" centers on the relationship between Charlie and Nicole Barber. Charlie is an emerging New York theatre director and Nicole is a revered actress who's followed him on the stage for the last decade. The good times are over now and the couple is in the process of divorce, with their eight-year-old son, Henry, caught in the middle.<br/><br/>The couple first decided to part ways amicably, but over time things got messier with lawyers and a sudden move by Nicole to Los Angeles. Now on opposite coasts, the two sides must bear the immense strain of splitting up while still trying to keep some semblance of their family together.<br/><br/>The 10th feature from Baumbach (and second for Netflix), the unfolding of ""Marriage Story"" takes several cues from its stage theatre setting.<br/><br/>Numerous scenes play out in long, uninterrupted takes as characters move around the space, delivering monologues aimed at the audience just as much as they are at other characters. The blocking of each camera and character movement is superb as it allows scenes to flow with grace and deliver their maximum effect.<br/><br/>Accenting Baumbach's work behind the camera is an orchestral score from legendary musician Randy Newman. The score calls back to Newman's similar work in ""Toy Story"" as the mood swings back and forth from playful to somber.<br/><br/>A writer first and director second, Baumbach's screenplay contains both unparalleled honesty and authenticity. The film opens with Charlie and Nicole saying what they love about the other, only for it to be revealed that it's all part of an exercise assigned to them by their divorce counselor. This perfect establishing scene and many others work wonders at making us feel for their relationship and connect it to our experiences, both good and bad.<br/><br/>Being as this is a semi-autobiographical film for Baumbach about his earlier divorce, you may fear that bias would be present. Luckily, Baumbach isn't interested in taking sides. He may give Charlie a little more of the benefit of the doubt, but overall he paints a balanced picture where both the features and flaws of each character are on display.<br/><br/>And despite the depressing subject matter, the film is still able to be quite funny as comedy gets weaved throughout. This is usual for Baumbach, who uses humor as an addition to the drama rather than a clean break from it.<br/><br/>Playing Charlie and Nicole is Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, respectively. Each of them is amazing on their own and will deservedly be showered with awards this season.<br/><br/>They each have their big individual scenes and one grand, one together, but where they each make their money is in the little scenes between the big ones. A small facial movement here or special line delivery there goes a long way in developing who they are and what they stand for.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is also great as Nicole's no-nonsense lawyer, Nora. Dern has made a name for herself as tough characters, and she continues that here with a fierce, commanding performance.<br/><br/>Alan Alda and Ray Liotta play Charlie's two lawyers that have two very different styles that complement each of their acting strengths. Alda is the gentler and presentable one when compared to Liotta's more hostile and brash demeanor.<br/><br/>Never before has a film been so pleasantly depressing and genuinely funny at the same time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, or you'll do both at the same time. By the time the credits start rolling, you'll have been on a journey with not just these characters, but also with yourself."

"grantpaulsen","10","26","54","7 December 2019"," Most Well Written Film in a Long Time. I cried...
","One of the best and most emotional films of the year. I cried. I haven't seen any of Noah Baumbach's previous films but I really want to now after seeing this film. To start off I want to talk about the two main actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, they are incredible. Their performances are perfect, not only the best I've seen this year, but some of the best I've ever seen. Scarlett's character was one who is asked to showcase a lot of emotion, and I was shocked to see that she was attempting to hold back that emotion for a good portion of the film which made her performance all the more real and powerful. And not held back in the sense that the emotion is not present, but rather in a sense that it's realistic, because when she's speaking around other people it makes sense why the character wouldn't want to cry in front of them. I thought it was so brilliant that she found the perfect point where it looked like she was tearing up but not quite crying. And Adam Driver just brought so much passion and expression to this role. He really immersed himself deep into this character to the point where I forgot I was watching Adam Driver acting and I instead just saw the character. And I think the best kind of acting is the kind where you stop seeing the actor and you just see the character. Quite frankly both of them deserve to win Oscars for these roles. I love Joaquin Phoenix and he's long overdue for an Oscar, but I think Adam Driver deserves it more. The writing for this film was superb, the script and dialogue were perfect. Quite honestly I think this is the best screenplay of the year, I hope the Academy honors it with an Oscar as well. Noah Baumbach did a good job directing as well, there were plenty of long takes that really captured the power of the scene. This film is very character driven and dialogue heavy, it's a very quiet film, nothing miraculous is happening on screen. When it comes to heavily dramatic films such as this one, there's a lot of directors who would attempt to make a lot of scenes over the top, overdramatized, and larger than what they really are or should be. But Noah Baumbach portrays this story about a divorce and all the dramatic scenes in a very realistic manner that never felt over dramatic or went too far, and I thought that was absolutely brilliant. As far as the characters go, they are flawless. They are the most fleshed out and deeply explored characters I've seen this year. They are incredibly interesting and complex. Quite honestly this film showcases a story that's been told before, but it makes all those films that came before it look shallow and underdeveloped. The film doesn't explain the characters to you, it just presents them, and it doesn't take sides with either one, because they are so complex that quite honestly there isn't a good guy or bad guy in this scenario. They're simply just two people who aren't good for each other and are just not working. Whichever one you found yourself siding with, in the end the film makes you realize that it doesn't matter. The score from Randy Newman was also fantastic, it complimented the visuals and conveyed the tone of the film very well. The best aspects of this film were the acting and the writing, so you should see it on those merits alone, and it's on Netflix right now so you can watch it in the comfort of your own home. I thought this was one the best and most powerful films of the year and just so well written."

Not everything is as black and white with love, like most of the classical romantic movies out there.

"mrrobertdavidfox","8","7","11","31 December 2019"," 👌🏻
","Wow, the movie was great. I haven't watched any movies of Scarlett Johansson besides her portrayal of Black Widow and I must admit I was surprised. The way she portrayed Nicole Barber was just great. Adam Driver was a great actor as well. His portrayal of Charlie was just great. I like how in the monologue they gave us an idea of how the story progresses and how the character's personality fits in the narrative. Also, I would like to applaud the director and writer, Noah Baumbach. This is my first view of his work and I'm really impressed. Some people may say that the film gets boring because of the dialogue and stuff, but the content of it makes the story more realistic in my opinion. And don't get me started on the acting -- it was just pure raw emotion. I teared up tons of times. The movie overall portrays the proceedings of getting a divorce, it became very interesting as it showed more side of jurisdiction, specifically when it comes to child support. Both parties fighting for their rights and trying their best not to ruin their children's life.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 8/10.<br/><br/>PS: I'm new to writing a review. Please do share your thoughts on how I'll improve in terms of being a critique. Also do point out things I've missed or should emphasize on my review. Thanks, y'all."
"cardsrock","9","7","11","31 December 2019"," A painfully real look at divorce
","Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give everything they have in telling the story of how the dissolution of a marriage can have such profound, unintended effects on a family. This movie focuses on depicting how it's not always someone's fault for getting a divorce. You can understand both characters' point of view and how you can still love someone, but not want to be with them. The cast is stellar and Johansson gives probably the best performance of her career. Baumbach excels at focusing on the little moments that play out in a divorce that ultimately can impact a family more than the big ones. Marriage Story is heart-wrenching, but one of the best acted films of the year and a true must watch. Just make sure you bring tissues."
"gconnelly-00234","3","17","33","30 December 2019"," Very Dull
","This is a very uninteresting movie. The lead actors are talented veterans but they don't have much to work with.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that you hope will become better with the next scene, but it never happens.<br/><br/>It leaves you with a creepy feeling of sadness because every scene has the oppressive weight of divorce as the theme.<br/><br/>I'm guessing the writer or director is from New York. What New Yorkers don't seem to understand is that the rest of the country has an innate dislike for New Yorkers. So for a story to go over it has to make them seem funny, or clever, or have a damn good plot. All of which this film lacks.<br/><br/>Sorry, it's a real downer."
"CinemaSerf","8","20","40","23 November 2019"," At last, Netflix hits the jackpot.
","I was nervously expecting more shades of ""Kramer vs Kramer"" when I saw the subject matter. Well, it's nothing like. Scarlett Johansson shines as the actress/wife conflicted every-which-way by her collapsing marriage; Laura Dern is wonderful as ""Nora"" the truly obnoxious attorney and it's good to see Alan Alda, albeit briefly, back on the big screen too. The marvel for me, though, is Adam Driver. Who knew? He usually suffers from the curse of the tall man - his clothes never quite fit, he has that slightly jowly look and rarely ever seems to get a part that he can get his teeth into. He sure does, here - arousing passion, sympathy, disgust and pity - and he does a decent enough rendition of Sondheim to boot. He is a revelation and helps this film to deliver as candid a reflection on the divorce process that I've ever seen. It's over two hours long, but well worth it."

"nadirairdiana","8","2","2","17 May 2020"," Empathy reflected in script-writing, acting and directing
","'Marriage Story' is inspired by the experience of its own director. Baumbach himself has been divorced from Jennifer Jason Leigh and has used his parents' divorce as inspiration for his previous film. He said, ""I have a real connection to the material ... but I was also at a time in my life where many of my friends were getting divorced. I saw it as an opportunity to do something more expansive, so I did a lot of research. I interviewed a lot of my friends, and friends of friends, and then also lawyers, judges, mediators."" Adam Driver perhaps has shown one of his best performances yet, having most well known for a HBO TV Series 'Girls'.<br/><br/>The opening and closing scenes work as sequences and works well together, without giving away the plot of the film. Most of all, this is a film that looks really realistic since it is based on quite a lot of research. People do not have to be married to understand this film as the film will definitely show us how it feels to be main characters, Nicole and Charlie. The film also built empathy for both characters even though they are experiencing divorce. This is something really rare as divorce is often depicted as husband or wife's fault but never both. Here's a review of how the film uses editing for empathy, which really works well with the script-writing, acting and directing of the film."

"yost-46753","9","2","2","3 May 2020"," Beautiful and ugly emotional depiction of a family relationship ending in divorce
","Marriage Story is a deep and emotional roller coaster of a film that follows the relationship of Charlie and Nicole throughout their marriage, separation, then into their divorce. The film highlights all of the emotions felt through the beginning and ending of a marriage, as well as, the considerations two people must make for their children, in this particular case, Henry, their son.<br/><br/>At the start of the movie, you gain insight into Charlie's passion of directing plays. As one of his most favorite actors, Nicole, is portrayed as loving acting, or at least being in the light. Similar to the perspectives shown in the 2005 film The Squid and the Whale, this film shows the differences in views that children and adults go through when a family is going through a divorce.<br/><br/>The use of close up shots of the actors when speaking, accentuates the emotion felt during arguments, casual conversation, and the back and forth dialogue between attorneys in the courtroom. In one scene, Charlie and Nicole are in the courtroom and their lawyers are discussing what each person deserves when it comes to money. You can tell that neither one of them wants to hurt the other, but their lawyers are so caught up in winning that it becomes a fight of words in who is the better person and who is the better parent. Both Charlie and Nicole lave the courtroom feeling disappointed, hurt, and angry at the other.<br/><br/>At the time of his first visit to LA, Charlie is laying in bed with Nicole and Henry. He is reading to Henry and the camera angle is set at the side of the bed. In view is Nicole, with a focal emphasis on her eyes. She is listening to Charlie read and begins to cry. This scene seems to be a mourning of the life they shared together and will soon do apart.<br/><br/>Marriage Story uses a plethora of shot techniques to emphasize the feeling and emotion of their words. In a scene towards the end of the film, Charlie goes back to New York, from visiting Henry (and Nicole) in Los Angeles. He has met his theatre company at a local piano bar, which is also presented during the film at different times of their marriage. Charlie proceeds to sing a song, ""Being Alive"". This song puts the relationship of Charlie and Nicole into a viewpoint that they both will love each other forever and that they were both confused during their marriage.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this film was directed in a way for the audience to feel connected to the actors. It was a wonderful portrayal of how a relationship of two people can be viewed completely different by each of them. It also shows that although divorce is normally a horrible experience, those going through it can find bright spots and end up amicable."
"zoerigho","Null","2","2","2 May 2020"," Great Driver
","Adam Driver was excellent, but the movie should have been called Lawyers' divorce story."
"amithkumarshankar","8","2","2","26 March 2020"," Two sides of a Divorce
","Marriage Story captures both sides of the story for once, which is kind of rare I would say in the cinematic world. Charlie and Nicole start the story by writing about each other, the things they love about each other when they are in one of the therapist sessions. Nicole declines to share her writings and Charlie was keen on sharing his but Nicole was no longer interested in Charlie or his thoughts. What sounds like a perfect marriage, slowly shows us how the two ends up destroying each other in ways they never thought they could.
Charlie has always been dependent on his work, his life revolved around his theatre. His choices were based on what he thought would be best, Nicole never had a say and it was getting to a point where she felt she was nothing but worthless as an individual. The writer and the director of the movie have played with emotions, not everything is sad and dull, there is a lot of humor as well. The scene where Nicole wants to serve Charlie with the papers has to be one of the best scenes in the movie, it shows the complete chaos that happens in a family.
The couple had agreed to solve everything by themselves and make sure that their son does not feel the wrath of the divorce. But when Nicole moves back to LA, she becomes a totally different person, in her terms she's finally free and can make decisions and choices of her own. Henry, their son slowly loses interest in his father as he enjoys his mother's company more. Charlie does not give up on his son easily, he in fact fights for him till the very end.
You get to experience the true bitter nature of both the characters when they involve the lawyers. Nicole's lawyer Nora is well known to get the best possible deals for her clients, while Charlie struggles to find a lawyer at first, he later finds someone who was very lethargic in nature. Charlie eventually hires Jay after he realizes Nicole is ready to destroy him no matter what.
A scene where Charlie and Nicole go against each other is probably one of the most emotional scenes of the movie as you get to understand how bad they could taint each other. The movie ends with possibly one of the best sequences in which Henry is reading the notes that Nicole had made in the first scene of the movie, Charlie reads it and eventually bursts into tears and Nicole stands behind him equally emotional. Marriage story is indeed a complete circle."

"teleconman","Null","2","2","1 January 2020"," 'Marriage Story'- a review
","'Marriage Story' showcases the rough experience of going through a divorce. At he same time, however, there are moments where love and affection are present but never really touched upon. I find it ironic that the title of the movie includes the word 'marriage', when it's an antithesis of what a marriage should be. In fact, outside of the two lead actor's divorce, it seems like the image of the perfect relationship is never shown. Most of the people we meet come from a poor relationship as well. The film, as could be expected, is driven by the acting. I would say that everyone in the movie did a great job. The acting gives a sense of realism and emotion that just captures your attention. An outside variable that makes the movie that much stronger is how divorces have become quite the norm. Perhaps you know someone that's divorced. Maybe the causes of divorce aren't the same as in the movie, but just the circumstances that come into play really make you feel sorry for the characters. As far as filmaking goes, I would say that long takes are frequently used in the movie and give a great purpose. The thing about long takes is that they are only great if the audience is unaware of them. So the performances are so well, that they should make you forget about the fact that it's one take. Overall, it's a powerful movie that isn't that big. The impact it makes is just amazing."

"flickernatic","2","73","179","25 November 2019"," Divorce Story LA style - A ghastly spectacle!
","Movies about people who make movies are always suspect for their tendency to lapse into self-indulgence (much as novels about writers are), the more so when the writer is also the director (Noah Baumbach here). When this is accompanied by a running time of over two-and-a-quarter hours, the alarm bells are ringing before you even enter the cinema.<br/><br/>Such expectations are rapidly and amply confirmed by this mis-titled movie, which drags on far too long for its own and the viewers' good. Billed as a 'marriage story', the focus is on divorce.But the subtext is 'woman triumphant in a world of pathetic men'. In short, this is yet another AMM (Anti-Man Movie).<br/><br/>In a movie based on contrasting pairs, NYC vies with LA, East Coast with West, theatre directing with movie making, lawyer-free divorce proceedings with lawyer-dominated, in control Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) with her hapless husband, Charlie (Adam Driver). While the leading female characters are portrayed as strong, powerful, determined, funny, talented, competent and winners, the men are generally either rapacious brutes (the LA lawyer, Jay) or self-centred infants. Charlie epitomises the latter: he's really not very good at anything much apart from theatre directing. He's not much good at marriage and doesn't handle divorce well either; he's not much good with practical tasks, such as fitting a child's car seat, he's clumsy, accidentally slashing his arm with a pocket knife, and is even told by the lover with whom he had a one night stand that ended his marriage that he's not good at accepting generosity when she offers more of the same and he refuses.<br/><br/>Charlie is not a bad guy but he's a child who needs mothering rather than an adult, a status rather crudely emphasised by the weird 1970s hairstyle he shares with his six-year old son. Moreover, Nicole cuts his hair for him too. I was half-expecting to see her spongeing him down in the bathtub and drying between his toes! Thus at the end of a furious row that, like everything else, goes on much longer than needed for dramatic effect, it is Charlie who breaks down, only to be comforted with a pat on the head by resolute Nicole. And then, in the movie's closing scene, as Charlie is about to take his son for some dad-and-lad time, Nicole notices his shoelace is untied and ties it for him. Gee, the guy can't even lace his own shoes! No wonder he couldn't cope with Nicole.<br/><br/>Since the story itself has very little originality, everything hangs on the performances and the direction. Unfortunately, the scaffolding that holds everything together is all too evident. Often one can sense the presence of the director and the cameras lurking in front of the cast and read the directions - 'we need a set piece monologue from Scarlett here with a long close-up'. As a result, there is no chemistry between the leads because everything seems too obviously contrived. Subtlety is certainly not the movie's strong point. The only really convincing performance comes from Alan Alda who plays the kindly NY lawyer, Bert Spitz, a minor character.<br/><br/>And then there is the uneasy attempt at mixing genres. In part this is a serious domestic drama with the fate of the warring couple's child at stake. But Baumbach also goes for humour, with some OTT performances from the LA lawyers, especially Laura Dern, and even puts in a song-and-dance number by the triumphant Nicole, her neurotic mother and ditzy sister, and a mournful solo song from Charlie. The effect of this mixture is jarring.<br/><br/>Frankly, we couldn't wait to be divorced from this self-indulgent film.

"antoniatejedabarros","6","50","119","6 December 2019"," Oh, boy, that was depressing! / A homage to divorce
","Couples don't divorce, families do. That's why the description of this film on IMDB does not make any sense: ""Noah Baumbach's incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together."" When a couple decides to end their marriage, they throw their family to the garbage. This film is a homage to divorce, and that's why I didn't like it.<br/><br/>Although with stunning performances, the film is entirely depressing. Why they call it a comedy-drama is a mystery to me. I didn't laugh even once. The message of the film? Don't fight for your love, destroy your marriage, scratch your spouse's eyes and wreck you children's lives.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I think that to stay together and try to reconnect after a crisis requires a lot of braveness, courage, infinite love and forgiveness. I believe in fighting for your love and not in separation. And when you've decided to have kids, separation can't even be an option. Unless you are in a highly dysfunctional marriage (abuse, drugs, persistence infidelity), grow up and work on your marriage. Divorce is a failure. Stop treating it like something that is OK. Children carry the scars of divorce all their lives, and couples lose for ever the opportunity of reconnecting and growing. Since 50% of the people who marry today get bored after a while and seek divorce, I'm sure my review will not be liked, but I don't care.<br/><br/>Some say this film could be Woody's. Of course not! Woody Allen's films are a 1,000 times more brilliant and deep that these 2 hours of depressing boredom. Others compare this film to Kramer vs. Kramer. Also not. Kramer vs. Kramer, although talks about divorce too, is a very deep and good film.<br/><br/>The music of Marriage Story, BTW, is really annoying. The direction, meh. The cinematography is great, very long shots, and Scarlett and Adam's performances, I must say, are absolutely stunning. 6/10"

I felt no compassion for Scarlett Johansson's character, and spent the whole time wondering why this script was so dull and humorless. I realized then it was because it was written too shallow and didn't explore any nuance whatsover. I don't know how it's being touted so hard, maybe because it's one of three or four non-superhero movies for the Oscars, but it's not really written into enough to be a classic.

","I am a woman and found this movie to be an unflattering portrayal of women. Nicole turned out to be so selfish, never considering what was best for her son, being nice to Charlie to his face then backstabbing him, and destroying the whole theater troupe for her own fame.<br/><br/>I also was offended by Nora's speech about women, the Virgin Mary, and God. She just tried to manipulate Nicole into doing things (like speaking to 11 lawyers around town, ugh, how mean!) for her own ego so she could win the case, not for any noble victory for women.<br/><br/>Nicole never seemed that interested in being a mom, and as far as the movie portrayed it, never tried counseling with her husband before blindsiding him with the divorce papers. My husband and I could not understand why her desire to have her own career separate from her husband's was grounds for divorce. And poor Henry being a pawn in all this.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is the acting was very good and the movie was compelling enough to watch the whole thing instead of turning it off after 15 minutes.<br/><br/>And what's with all the singing? The movie was already too long and then we had to listen to Charlie sing the ENTIRE song?

"ElMaruecan82","9","14","28","8 December 2019"," Scenes From a Broken Marriage ...
","40 years after ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", here comes Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"", a well-written, well-directed and certainly well-acted movie tackling the difficult subject of divorce and through it marriage, responsibility... and love. That the film is a major Oscar contender doesn't surprise me but I like what that critical acclaim reflects: a movie about divorce must obey to higher standards of filmmaking than any drama subgenre; many are masterpieces such as Farhadi's ""Separation"" or Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"".<br/><br/>The point of a divorce film isn't to take sides, you've got to show two persons with their strengths, flaws, the qualities they take for granted and weaknesses they don't suspect. The three-dimensionality you bring up to the characters and the way they interact through conflicts, tenderness or awkward moments have the challenging complexity of an emotional Rubik-cube game. A quote in ""Marriage Story"" says ""crime lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst"" and that's the point: marriage movies insist on flaws that are only flipsides of qualities.<br/><br/>And so the film starts beautifully with two monologues from each of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlet Johansson), describing what they like best in each other. The descriptions insist on so many details that it's impossible not to relate to both of them, I often brew tea I end up not drinking like Nicole and I'm a bad loser when it comes to games like Charlie. The opening monologues are exposition masterstrokes (with a twist at the end), allowing us to know about the couple, their roles as parents and their jobs: Charlie is a theater director who found a muse in Nicole, a previous TV star who abandoned her dreams for Charlie.<br/><br/>Together they had a child named Henry (a reference to Justin Henry who played Billy in ""Kramer""?), the kid played by Azhy Robertson, is obviously the sinews of the war. Since Charlie lives and works in New York and Nicole stars in a TV show shot in L.A., much more they married in L.A. and it's Henry's birthplace, there's more at stakes than a matter of custody. Charlie wants Henry back to New York but Nicole's rising career is in L.A.. The battle opens with promises never to go to court but we know it's a matter of inevitability. The trick is that no one wants to accuse the other of bad parenting, nor to brag about being the better parent, it's all about saying what's best for the kid.<br/><br/>But can any parent be that objective when it comes to the child? Spending more time with his mother, Henry's bias leans in her direction while Charlie becomes the stranger who does his best to accommodate him. It takes someone who's gone through divorce to understand Charlie's situation. I see my own daughter twice every month during weekends and half the holidays, and whenever I see her I feel forced to satisfy her caprices, which is not the right way to educate, but since you're put in a situation where you want to live the moment to its fullest and not spoil it, you spoil your kid.<br/><br/>And when the kid behaves badly, you almost take it as an affront... and must endure people who pretend not to judge your parenting and you know they do. That's the paradox of divorce, you try to display the best parenting and yet it might be perceived as the worst like in that sequence where Charlie is being observed and does his best to avoid complications... that ultimately happen. Divorce complicates relationships and I'm glad a film could show it so remarkably, with brutality or humor.<br/><br/>I saw ""Kramer"" with my then-wife and she ended up (to my surprise) rooting with Ted while I kind of empathized with Joanna, especially her suffocation through marital commitment and wish to find herself. It's important not to make a conflict binary and this is why the ""character study"" is important, why we should understand someone's inner personalities. Charlie is an artist who's dedicated to his art in a disciplined manner, Nicole is a dreamer who needs to be her own master. Together they love each other but here's what I said about Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"":<br/><br/>""While loving someone is a genuine feeling, being married implies duties whose applications might interfere with our inner personalities. Whether it's sex life, success and dreams, they can be undermined by marital life. The danger is to start looking at the man or the woman of our life as the one who's sinking it into the abysses of routine and conventions.""<br/><br/>That's how Nicole started to look at Charlie and vice versa, that's the way she describes him in a bravura speech where she tells her lawyer (a scene-stealing Laura Dern) how she feels about him, and a later moment where Charlie vents his anger on Nicole and culminates with a wish to see her die, before busting into tears. I love that he regained his composure and said ""sorry"" and that Nicole didn't even take it badly, it's for subtle moments like this that I think the film should take home a few golden boys. Driver has a raw natural magnetism and Johannson is given the most difficult role and both are perfect in acting naturally and also unnaturally. The best 'actors' being the lawyers.<br/><br/>As someone who went through these stages of bargains through love letters, these moments where we cry ourselves to sleep, anger when we blame the other for failing the marriage vows and we realize we won't see our children regularly, when we even miss the in-laws, the film is poignantly cathartic even in a resigned state.<br/><br/>And I mentioned the notion of ""acting"" in marriage, maybe the real act of fidelity in marriage is to be faithful to yourself in the first place. What Charlie and Nicole achieve at the end."

It's a public service announcement (PSA) story created by Noah Baumbach to warn us of the perils of Marriage, especially as it concerns fatherhood.<br/><br/>Now the following isn't a spoiler because with very few exceptions aside this is how divorce works --<br/><br/>There are no villains in Marriage Story, only two flawed human beings, but make no mistake about it... the wife makes out like gangbusters here, as they almost always do. She basically got everything she wanted and more. She got the Kid, at least half of everything, and essentially made her ex-husband have to relocate to L.A. so he could be a father to his son.<br/><br/>It's a very sobering film that should be made required viewing for all guys.
Noah Baumbach did a great job writing and Directing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were both really terrific, though I think that Laura Dern was the real standout in a scintillating supporting role. She totally deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because it's so simple and straight forward.

","I normally love Noah Baumbach's films -- he has a way of skewering pretences and portraying very real people in the midst of an emotional crisis. When I booked for this at the 2019 London Film Festival, it sounded like it would be Baumbach's ""Annie Hall"", and it certainly starts well, with a sparky script and a great cast, but it soon grinds to a plod due to the complete lack of chemistry between the leads and therefore absolutely no feeling, no matter how much they talk about it, that they have any kind of shared history (even their son, used - natch - as a bargaining chip throughout the messy divorce, has about as much appeal as a potato). During one particularly lengthy argument, Scarlett Johannson glows with incandescent rawness, but can't strike a spark from her co-star, the dead-eyed and apparently sedated Adam Driver. I'll admit, his appeal escapes me, but he sure can sing -- he inexplicably gets to sing an entire number from ""Company"" at a piano bar, and pulls it off admirably well. But this film is overlong, over shouty and brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I think I'll watch ""Annie Hall"" again, thanks."

And despite the darkness of the subject matter, Baumbach, Johansson, and Driver are able to inject so many moments of tenderness, honesty, and raw emotion that the film manages to leave you with a sense of hope for its characters despite the seemingly hopeless situation.

","What a damn good film !!! Like from top to bottom this is an example of a brilliantly directed and acted film........period ! The most impressive thing to me, personally, is how easy the film is to watch even though the subject matter is so tragic and heart breaking............you genuinely feel for both of them. However that is helped by the incredible acting in this film!<br/><br/>You know a film is good when it even reaches an audience or demographic it isn't intended for............that would be me! Who would have thought that a single/unmarried male in his twenties would really enjoy and like this film? I didn't before seeing it. But the critic reviews and buzz around the film meant it was almost unavoidable with the Oscars coming around soon. I couldn't believe that I'd end up actually like this film let alone really enjoying it. The main reason is because its a human story but you as the audience are watching it from the outside...........so it doesn't necessarily need to be relatable for you to understand or get it. Like this sort of situation is a million miles away from my personally life and at what stage I'm in my life. However even though it wasn't relatable to me in away way shape or form it was just so easy and riveting to watch.<br/><br/>There are three individuals as to why this film works so well. Firstly Noah Baumbach just a brilliantly directed but more impressively written film. There are some really long and dialogue heavy scenes in this film, which must have been a nightmare to do, but it flows so well in the story and the characters portrayed. Oscar nod for both.....probably. Talking of the characters portrayed, Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are just both simply incredible!!! There are no others words for them both, you could be witnessing career defining moments for both of them!! Award nods for both of them is a lock..............I would be shocked if they didn't because I think they both deserve to win!! All I'm gonna say is that there is an argument scene.........wow just wow, some incredibly emotional acting.<br/><br/>Overall to be honest I am quite stunned that I ended up really liking this film because this is not my type of genre of film and I am certainly not the demographic for this film. So for those reasons alone there are no excuses as to why anyone shouldn't see this film!! Absolutely brilliant from Noah Baumbach but I think his work is overshadowed by his actors in Driver and Johansson respectively. 80% out of 100 its a really really damn good film that anyone can watch and enjoy!"

","This was one of my most anticipated films of the entire year. I loved Noah Baumbach ever since I saw Frances Ha and this film isn't just my favourite film of his but also my favourite of the year so far.<br/><br/>Marriage Story follows Charlie and Nicole, a couple going through a divorce and how the actual legal process of that divorce is affecting them.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach is an extremely talented filmmaker. I love his approach of making films about mundane life as there is so much that can be done from a character perspective. He possesses the ability to make characters feel real and create wonderful interactions between each of them. However, what he achieved with Marriage Story is stunning in every way.<br/><br/>This is a film that really focuses on its characters and their thoughts and feelings. We really understand the pain and struggle both protagonists are going through as Baumbach allows us to spend alone time with both characters and hear their perspective on the situation. There are some truly heartbreaking scenes that may be hard to watch and none of that would have been achieved without the brilliance of Baumbach's screenplay and magnificent acting from Johansson and Driver.<br/><br/>I don't think words can justify how phenomenal the acting is. This is Adam Driver's best performance yet. He deserves a lot of awards and merit for his work here. You can tell his character is breaking down inside as Driver packs a lot of emotion into each scene. This is also the best I ever saw Scarlett Johansson. There is a scene where she explains why she's getting a divorce and that scene is so moving due to the amount of emotion Johansson expresses whilst reciting the dialogue. The most distressing scene is when both of them argue and it contains some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Laura Dern and Ray Liotta also create a great amount of impact in every scene they're in.<br/><br/>Baumbach's script is one of, if not, the best script of the year. Each dialogue and conversation between characters feel extremely real and bring a sense of authenticity to what's taking place. It also sheds light on the nature of each character so we, as an audience, learn how everyone behaves. Apart from the characters, this film also focuses on the legal process of the divorce as well and how it can worsen the phase the couple are going through. Baumbach's direction is also fantastic. He uses a lot of long takes which effectively brings out the emotional punch that deeply affects the people watching.<br/><br/>Hats off to Noah Baumbach, Scarlett Johansson, Adam Driver and everyone who worked on this film. Marriage Story is a masterclass in terms of its characters, script and acting. This is definitely going to take all the awards home which won't bother me at the slightest because Marriage Story deserves all of them."

She has just gotten a TV pilot, so she's off to California with their son. They've agreed to an amicable divorce, but she gets a lawyer in California, so he gets a lawyer in California, and things go straight to heck.<br/><br/>Hitchcock said ""The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder."" Netflix has set that at naught. Once upon a time, you saw a movie in a theater, and you didn't want to duck out on a feature, so you headed for the facilities while the James Fitzpatrick Traveltalk was on. Later, you might see it on television, where the presence of ""station identifications"" served as features rather than bugs. Now we have the ability to not only watch from the comfort of our homes, but to stop and start the movie at our pleasure. You can watch this movie's 136 minutes -- that's the length of a season of a British series -- in little more than two hours, or stretch it to over whatever time you wish. Go, take a bath, read WAR AND PEACE, take a trip around the world, these poor characters will be waiting to suffer for your pleasure whenever you like.<br/><br/>Is that even a movie as we understand the word? With the constraint of time removed, there's no need to limit the length of the...show. Nor was there much evidence that the film makers had. The leads are brilliant performers; they indulge in long, one-shot monologues, they inhabit their characters, it's a brilliant supporting cast, the leads each sing a song from Sondheim's COMPANY, and by the end of it, it seemed to have gone on as long as my 18-month divorce had. As soon as I left the theater, I began to trim the movie in my own mind, and soon had taken half an hour from it without losing anything from the story. True, you wouldn't hear Miss Johanssen, Julie Hagerty and Merritt Wever sing ""You Could Drive A Person Crazy"" in my version, showing the enormous range and ability necessary to winning awards. But you could go on a date, eat a meal, see the movie, and get home in time to get to work the next morning.<br/><br/>Oh, concessions could have been made. An intermission could have been put in. It wasn't, because it was never made with that in mind. So, no, I don't think it's a movie, even if I did see it in a movie theater.<br/><br/>Was it good? As someone who went through a bad divorce, it was too raw for me."
"MOscarbradley","10","13","27","21 November 2019"," Baumbach's first masterpiece.
","I always knew Noah Baumbach had it in spades. His first couple of films hinted at it; ""The Squid & the Whale"" confirmed it and he's never looked back since then. Certainly not as prolific as Woody Allen to whom he's sometimes compared, there's a sadness and depth to his work that only a few Allen pictures captured while at the same time being devastatingly funny and I do think devastating is the most appropriate word for the best of Baumbach.<br/><br/>From ""The Squid & the Whale"" onwards, everything he's done has been painfully funny but ""Marriage Story"" is his first masterpiece, (I'm sure there will be others). Apparently autobiographical to a large degree it's a two hour plus dissection of a divorce rather than the marriage that preceded it with nods to both Woody Allen and Ingmar Bergman, most noticeably referenced by a poster for ""Scenes from a Marriage"", seen early on so as to get it out of the way.<br/><br/>Charlie, (Adam Driver), is a New York Theatre director and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson), his LA born actress wife who may or may not have given up a lucrative career on the screen to come to New York and act with his mostly experimental theatre group that also includes Wallace Shawn. They have an eight year old son Henry, (an excellent Azhy Robertson), who seems to take their divorce and being shunted from the East to the West Coast with a degree of pragmaticism unusual for a child. Despite tearning emotional strips off each other every now and then Charlie and Nicole still seem to love each other or at least like each other very much and despite divorcing and living on opposite sides of the country they obviously need each other, particularly when there's a powercut.<br/><br/>And yes, like all of Baumbach's works this is painfully funny; laugh-out-loud funny several times over but also uncomfortable and even painful to watch on occasion and sometimes moving from one extreme to the other in the same scene. It's beautifully written by the always literate Baumbach and magnificently acted by the entire cast. Driver and johansson have never been better, (his rendition of Sondheim's 'Being Alive' is a killer moment), while Laura Dern and Alan Alda as two of their lawyers are both Oscar-worthy. (Ray Liotta is also superb as the kind of lawyer who might have just walked out of ""Goodfellas""). It's also great to see ""Airplane"" actress Julie Hagerty in a role worthy of her talents as Johansson's ditzy mother.<br/><br/>Baumbach also has great fun contrasting the differing lifestyles of artists in New York, (anal retentive), and LA, (vacuous and rich), while one of the film's running gags is that everyone in LA keeps referring to its biggest selling point as 'the space'. That it ends on a note of optimism is testament to Baumbach's overriding belief in humanity and if he sides with Driver it's probably because Driver is just Baumbach with a pout."
"dfe51","5","18","40","13 December 2019"," Waste of Time
","Unless your a new divorce lawyer trying up their game, this movie is a waste of time. The first two minutes of the movie are great, then out of the blue, diver. It doesn't make any sense. Both parents are protrude as loving couple and good parents. The only two things we learn alters one she does feel her feelings mater, well lady the line forms at the left and circles the equator twice. The only thing we learn, that is totally out of character, is that he has had an affair. The only thing that this movie demonstrates is have paper thin young people are between marriage and divorce."
"gsygsy","6","21","48","14 November 2019"," An improvement
","This is a lot better than Mr Baumbach's deadly 'The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)', over which it's better to draw a veil. There is another film lurking in the shadows, however: 'Kramer vs Kramer', of which 'Marriage Story' might be considered a kind of 30-years-have-gone-by update. The ambition and unselfconscious self-obsession of Adam Driver's character is shared by Dustin Hoffman's in the earlier film. But Scarlett Johansson's character is allowed not to feel as guilty as Meryl Streep's for believing that she could be a better mother if she could be a whole person. Baumbach gives Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda very good speeches as a trio of lawyers explaining how the courts will stitch the opposing parties up.<br/><br/>There are some funny lines and one really excellent scene in which the leads tear into each other, no holds barred. But it's Driver's raw delivery of a Sondheim song that will probably impress most.<br/><br/>I wish I'd've liked it more, but in the end the travails of those in Mr Baumbach's navel-gazing world are not perhaps as universal as he might like to think."
"heat9120","9","5","8","14 January 2020"," Be prepared
","If you've been through a divorce, as a spouse or a child, be prepared. This movie will get you right in the gut. It will almost certainly dredge up highly painful memories -- I'm a now-grown child of divorce and I've been alternating between sadness and downright rage ever since I watched it. And my parents split 40 years ago. It's so good I almost wish I hadn't watched it.<br/><br/>The film is evenhanded overall, but I agree with those who, if they have to choose a side, go with Adam Driver's Charlie. Scarlett Johanssen's Nicole has felt like second fiddle in her marriage for years and once she moves to LA with their boy, she's clearly relishing being in control of the situation. She's continually deceiving Charlie and springing things on him: from hiring an aggressive divorce lawyer, for example, when they'd agreed not to use lawyers, to barring him from planned family activities with their son.<br/><br/>Nicole herself would probably argue that Charlie insensitively disregarded her wants for years, but that bad behavior would not justify hers. Two wrongs do not make a right, and his behavior was not in the service of separating a parent from their child."

","Marriage Story is one of the best films of 2019, and if anyone said this was their movie of the year, I would understand completely. This movie is a work of art in every meaning of the word, it makes the audience sit through this realistic take on a divorce. I live how a simple line of dialogue could change the story completely, theres literally a scene where one guy talks about how big LA is and it changes everything. The editing and casting is flawless, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both prove that their more than just action figures and give one of the best performances of the year, and I believe Scarlett deserves Best Actress at the Oscar's this year. By far a film that gets better as time goes by. The only thing holding it down is some annoying dialogue from Adam Driver's coworkers at his theater where he writes plays."

","This was not fun to watch, but extremely moving. Coming from a family with parents that have been together since high school and growing up in a very loving home this was moving to see. It might be because I'm a new dad and the thought of getting a divorce and putting my boy through this just hit to close to home. But I will dive in a little more.
I base movies on 3 items. #1 did it inspire me, like I mentioned I am a new dad and this was very inspiring in what not to do and pitfalls to try to avoid and made me want to step back and be a better husband and father. #2 did it leave me awestruck, coming from a loving home and family this was hard to see. It moved me emotionally. #3 was it entertaining, the acting was on point. Adam and Scarlett did an amazing job. The storyline flowed. I laughed I cried it was well worth my time.

The movie is hardly edge of your seat stuff but not every movie needs to be as long as the movie serves its purpose that's all that matters. The acting was beautiful and it is what you'd expect from real people who were in love once going through something as difficult as divorce. My favourite scene is when Charlie (Adam Driver) and his soon to be ex wife Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson) frustration finally reach boiling point and they just unload on each other. They shout, they scream, they say really hurtful things to each other until eventually they end up crying and hugging."

It is difficult to maintain the same level of emotional tension throughout in movies like this, but he did it. Having a very distanced relationship with divorce, I knew little of what its like to be a part of one, but this movie felt so real and so intimately related to the ugly process. This movie is incredible and sad, and I love it."
"RhapsodyReviews","10","5","8","2 January 2020"," A Really Magical Film.
","Review:
'Marriage Story' is a comedy-drama film directed by Noah Baumbach.
This movie was in contention of being my favorite of the year. 'Joker' just slightly edged it's way to be my number one.
The film follows a married couple (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) going through a coast-to-coast divorce.
Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson hit it out of the park with these incredible performances. They're great throughout the whole film, but there is a certain scene in this movie that everybody will talk about and it floored me. They way they act towards each other, they have great chemistry. Laura Dern also did a great job, playing a slimeball lawyer who keeps taking Johansson's character into things she doesn't want to do.
The real hero of this story however is Noah Baumbach, who also wrote the film and deserves all the praise. He is a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. He could truly be one of the last true story tellers working today.
Overall, the movie to me is basically flawless. It makes you laugh; it makes you cry; it even makes you feel things you can't identify. It's a heartbreaking story about how two people can love each other, but still know they aren't good for each other.
5/5"
"stefstars","10","5","8","2 January 2020"," Adam Driver Breaks Your Heart
","I can see why this is an award season favorite and rightfully so. Everyone does such an amazing job in this film and the story is told in a subtle yet wonderful way. You really see this couple's relationship deteriorate as the film progresses on. What I love is how they show the effect that a divorce can have on children. The mother, in this case, plays the role of a ""Sunday Father"" and buys the kid into preferring to be with her than his father. Yet you see how the little boy becomes less and less happy. It's so sad.<br/><br/>Both parents are imperfect but you really feel more for the father at the end of this than the mother. Maybe it's to do with Adam Driver's heartfelt performance, but I was left feeling so bad for him. You see how he holds on to the hope that she's still the same woman he fell in love with or that maybe their relationship will be healed, but you see how all that hope dies off as the divorce procedures get nastier and nastier. Scar Jo does a fantastic job in her role too. You see her frustration and indecisiveness so clearly. Her character really seems to act out of spite, especially after hiring that cruel LA lawyer. Laura Dern does an amazing job playing this horrid lawyer with the fake smile, I absolutely hated this woman the whole movie - that's how you know the actress played the part perfectly.<br/><br/>Every direction that was taken to tell this story was chosen so perfectly. The score, the dialogue, I'm just in love with this film. It felt like I was watching a play being performed on stage. That scene where they're in court before the judge and the lawyers are saying these horrid things about both and you see how both of them are so hurt by what's being said cos neither one truly felt or believed what their respective lawyers were saying. It's a scene that just breaks your heart and come to terms with the horrid reality of divorce and disillusioned marriages. Adam Driver though, he deserves an Oscar nod. I kid you not, this man just delivered with this role.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this film and congrats to the cast & crew on creating such a wonderful film."

I felt exactly like Charlie and felt all the emotions that he went through including the one where he realized he never truly understood his ex wife.<br/><br/>The fight scene, the worthless lawyers and the realization to just settle it amongst ourselves ... been there, done that.<br/><br/>They say divorces are hard, emotional when there is a kid involved. I attest to that whole heartedly. Great movie and I wish and pray that nobody ever has to go through the pain of divorce ever again."

"patriciogl10","8","5","8","31 December 2019"," Incredible performances elevate an honest portrayal.
","Marriage Story is a beautiful composition, plagued with heartfelt drama, severe emotional cuts and bruises, and a heartwarming honesty that relies heavily on the magnificent performances of its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson. Their performances elevate a very emotionally intelligent script, that knows in which moments to strike deep and clean, with resonating strong moments such as that powerful climax which will keep getting praise for years and years to come. Another standout is that musical number, with words almost as tragic as its performance, a solemn attemp by Adam Driver, whom has found his niche in demanding dramatic roles that require passion and strong intensity.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson gives a firm portrayal of a woman, wife and actress who lives by the shadow of his theatre director husband, drawing an accurate sense of an overlooked woman, whom despite being successful professionally, is still heavily damaged by a loveless marriage.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is not all about the performances, it feels like a real, authentic story, with a true and honest ending, which most of the times it is much more valuable than an happy one."
"paulp-29549","9","5","8","31 December 2019"," A slow, depressing movie about the dark realities.
","I suspect the people scoring this movie highly have, like me, been through an ugly, expensive divorce - quite probably one that started off with both parties agreeing to make it quick, simple and fair process. Then one or both see a lawyer and it goes downhill fast from there. In my case, The result was that I was told ""I just want what I deserve"", which proved to be a very subjective judgment on her part.<br/><br/>So with general heaviness of the heart, the stress of the opposing lawyer and the financials and the anguish of uncertain future access to the children, you try to push ahead.<br/><br/>This movie picks all this sort of heartache up extremely well - only the initiated would foolishly be hoping for a happy ending"
"Martinito_08183","9","5","8","31 December 2019"," One of the best movies of 2019.
","It's hard to find words to describe why ""Marriage Story"" is amazing. Everybody already said everything the needed to be said. It was a truly powerful and emotional journey that deserves to be revisited again and again. The strongest aspects of the movie are the writing and the performances and you can say that the story has been done many times before, but it goes so deep in the way it explores the characters that i found it fascinating to watch. You understand the two main characters, since their motivations are very clear and if you going to side with one character over the other - this does not mean that the other character doesn't give some valid points.<br/><br/>The scene where Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver) are arguing with each other was fantastic. That alone was the best scene that i saw the whole year. It was truly heartbreaking and hard to watch. If it was directed by a different person, then the scene would not work and it would have come out very cheesy and it could have been very hard to take it seriously.<br/><br/>The only problems that i had with the movie is the performance of Julie Hagerty (Nicole's mother), which i wasn't a huge fan, but i don't think that everyone will have that problem; Nicole's sister didn't play a huge role in the story and the movie had to remind us that she's still here and the score by Randy Newman was 40% great, while the other 60% was repeating the same track over and over.<br/><br/>Even with it's flaws, it's still one of the best movies of 2019 and i cannot wait to see it again. I'm giving ""Marriage Story"" a 9/10."
"dromasca","7","5","8","31 December 2019"," anatomy of a divorce
","'Marriage Story' directed by Noah Baumbach has been compared by many people to 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'and I can't help suspecting that this comparison was encouraged by or even originated in the PR machine of the film's producers. There are indeed many similar traits: both films belong to the genre of 'divorce films' and have as protagonists couples who have serious reasons to break up but also maintain strong emotional bonds; in both stories there is a child at an age at which the separation of parents cannot remain without the sequels who becomes the main subject of the custody dispute and divorce settlement; lawyers play an important role in deepening the conflicts; in the lead roles in the two films appear well-known and highly talented actors who combine their magnetism (of attraction and rejection), managing to create difficult-to-forget broken couples on screens. It remains to be seen if this recipe will work with the same success at the 40-year interval that separates the release of the two films. Matching the five Academy Awards collected by 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' is a challenge.<br/><br/>What has changed in the dynamics of divorce and the attitude of society in the 40 years that separate the two films? Charlie and Nicole, the divorced of 2019, could ultimately retain their affection and share the responsibility of child custody without lawyers or the institution of marriage, but eventually the social pressure brings them in the situation of the classic couples in legal conflict. As in the 1979 film, it is the wife who initiates the divorce, but the world has changed and the reasons have changed. Joana Kramer (Meryl Streep) was leaving Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) because he was too busy with his professional life and neglected his father and family duties. Charlie from 'Marriage Story' (Adam Driver) is an almost perfect husband and father, but the marriage suffocates Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) whose career as an actress stagnates in the shadow of the talented theater director who is her husband. The characters in Noah Baumbach's film are equal in professional aspirations, and in the affection that continues beyond the legal conflict and the legal separation, and also in the responsibility of the breaking up of the marriage. In fact, maybe they should never have married, that seems to be one of the possible lessons of the movie.<br/><br/>I am convinced that there are many different interpretations and opinions, and that 'Marriage Story' is currently being discussed in many families, circles of friends, social networks. One of the merits of the film is that the situation presented on screen and the rich and complex characters of the two main heroes open the appetite for such discussions. The acting performance of the two is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson plays one of the best roles of her career - she is assertive and vulnerable, ambitious and skeptical of doubts, a devoted but catchy mother, and an actress who does not give up her dream of success and achievement on screen. I know Adam Driver less, I have seen him in 'Star Wars', here he shows that he can play excellent and earthly roles. Some sequences suffer from excessive verbosity, but the actors manage to execute them with great vigor. I saw with great pleasure also Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, in the roles of lawyers of both parties, secondary but also key roles in the development of the story, both acting with aplomb and with a well-dosed sarcastic criticism. I was less excited about the insertion of the musical sequences towards the end, they do not fit well with the rest of the movie, they are too little for a musical and useless for a family drama. Despite less successful parts and ideas, 'Marriage Story' - which might have been called 'Divorce Story' as well - manages to captivate because of the topic and of the remarkable acting performances."

","I read the IMDb's storyline, saw the ratings here and on the other review sites I normally check, avoided reading actual reviews for fear of spoilers, and I was a bit concerned how the movie would make me feel after all that. I was not prepared, nor will you be if you haven't seen it, for a gut-wrenching experience.<br/><br/>It is so well done, from script to tempo, and of course to the acting performances of all the key characters, even the couple's son Henry, played by Azhy Robertson, who is believable rather than just endearing; you will be blown away by the realism of the whole thing.<br/><br/>If you have lived through a break-up, and many of us have, this movie will bring much of that sense of loss you may have experienced, and likely some of the guilt you/we should have. I should not be all that surprised that Noah Baumbach could deliver a good story like this one, after all he has built on past work and I think he will have an impossible time topping this one, as break-ups go.<br/><br/>Adam Driver, as a result of this movie and the earlier 2019 ""The Report"", is officially on my 'A"" list, the one that means future movies of his will automatically go on my 'to watch' list. I was very pleased to see Scarlett Johansson in the Nicole character; she delivered one of, if not the best, performances I've seen from her. She was already on my ""A"" list, since the 2005 movie 'Match Point'.

"MrDHWong","9","5","8","12 December 2019"," An often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity
","Marriage Story is a comedy-drama written and directed by Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Greenberg). Starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, it is an often poignant story about a declining marriage told with a rare feeling of sincerity.<br/><br/>In New York City, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) lives with his former actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and eight-year-old son Henry (Azhy Robertson) where he works as a theatre director for a successful stage company. Due to Charlie's commitment to his hard work, he and Nicole's once happy marriage begins to fall apart, and Nicole decides to move to Los Angeles where she has been offered the lead role in a TV pilot, taking Henry with her. Due to the lengthy travelling distance from east coast to west, Charlie struggles to find time to see Henry in amidst working on his current stage play and risks losing all custody of him in the impending divorce as a result.<br/><br/>With its powerful acting and careful direction, Marriage Story successfully sets itself apart from most other family dramas to become one of the best of its genre in years. It is not often to see a film that can balance both sides of the conflict with such care that it makes you truly think about the ramifications it has on not just the two fighting parties in question, but also the other family members as well. What is also taken into consideration is how extended family are affected too, with Nicole's mother and sister clearly having a close relationship with Charlie throughout the film, realising that their lives will be forever changed by this divorce as well. Of course, in the end, it is obvious that the most affected by all of this will be the child, being exposed to such heavy responsibilities at a young age, like deciding which parent they prefer to live with.<br/><br/>Writer/director Noah Baumbach handles this subject matter with just the right amount of realism to avoid spiralling into cliched territory. This may be due to the fact that Baumbach is a divorcee himself with a young son, and likely wished to depict this heavy topic as genuine as possible so as to reflect his own personal experiences. As well as this, Baumbach appears to have taken influence from films such as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and even his own film, 2005's ""The Squid and the Whale"", all of which dealt with the subject of divorce in both a light-hearted and serious manner. If I did have one problem, it is that the ending does showcase some brief unnecessary sentimentality, which does detract from the previously mentioned realism, but considering what we have seen each character go through, it only feels like a minor issue.<br/><br/>Both of the film's lead stars gave excellent performances. Seeing Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson verbally bounce off one another with such fiery intensity is truly a fascinating sight. I often found myself forgetting the two aren't actually a couple in real life as their chemistry is simply perfect. There is so much to appreciate in each time the two were interacting, thanks in part to Baumbach's solid script, which gave them several memorable scenes depicting the degradation of their marriage.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe this film will certainly strike a chord with anyone who has been through a divorce or has witnessed one unfold before their eyes. Personally, I haven't experienced either, but that did not affect my overall opinion of the film and that likely shouldn't for anyone else. My advice is to take in what the film has to say on this serious topic and appreciate what its writer/director and lead actors have presented for our viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

","Marriage Story is a Drama and by that a god damn great one, it never bored me for its length and the score is great and used in a fitting way.<br/><br/>The Characters and how they interact is the heart of any Drama and this is probably the movies strongest point, how the members of this family interact,suppress or express emotions, in such a realistic way, is completely mindblowing to me. There are countless scenes in the movie where the characters emotions are portrayed in such a subtle way and as a viewer you get how they feel, you can see it in their eyes voices etc. and not just cause they cry a whole lot.<br/><br/>This amount of character work is portrayed by the 2 amazing main actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, its probably one of, if not the best career performance for both of them.<br/><br/>This movie makes almost every other Family or most Dramas in general look shallow and unbelievable dull."

","As a lawyer who has handled many divorces I found the portrayal,of the lawyers to be oafish and cartoon like. Many talented lawyers handle divorce cases with great skill and minimize the often illogical hatred couples bring to them.<br/><br/>So while the film portrays the couple as sensitive and all too human the same screen writer took the easy way out and painted the lawyers as insensitive predators.

","Divorce movies don't typically capture the ambivalence of divorce. Marriage Story does. The highs and lows -- even while the agonizing process proceeds.

"msbreviews","9","5","8","9 December 2019"," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>I don't even know how to start this review... Marriage Story is one of those movies that stays with me long after I've finished it. I've been thinking about it a lot, and it's undoubtedly one of the most realistic dramas I've ever seen. That's due to the award-worthy performances of Adam Driver (Charlie Barber) and Scarlett Johansson (Nicole Barber), but also because of Noah Baumbach's incredibly layered screenplay. In addition to this, Baumbach is undeniably one of the best directors of the year. With the help of his DP, Robbie Ryan, he sets the platform for Driver and Johansson to shine as the astonishing actors that they are.<br/><br/>Some people watch films to forget their daily issues. Some just want to have fun. Some want to learn more about a particular true story. However, there's not a single person alive who wants to watch a movie and not be able to leave the theater (or, in this case, their couch) entertained. Marriage Story has such an emotionally complicated premise that it's tough to convince people to sit and watch. I mean, who wants to watch a divorce develop throughout more than two hours? Who wants to watch two people who were once in love with each other become the worst of themselves? Yelling, fighting, court, custody, lawyers... It's not exactly an attention-grabber.<br/><br/>I imagine people who went through the same situation getting triggered and remember a phase of their lives that was probably one of their worst. I'm writing this because I've seen some negativity towards people who simply don't want to watch Baumbach's depiction of a depressing event. It's perfectly understandable if anyone decides to skip this one, especially if it hits too close to home. In my case, I've never gone through a divorce (hopefully, I'll never will), and usually I can ""enjoy"" this type of sad, frustrating, bittersweet films (Manchester by the Sea, A Ghost Story) for what they are, no matter how tragic.<br/><br/>If I had to choose one-word praise: realistic. There's no way around it. The palpable emotions are the main reason why this story works so well. Only people who have never been in a relationship of any kind can't understand the moment when a fight starts to escalate, and the couple begins to say terrible stuff at each other that they don't exactly mean. The exaggeration and over-the-top arguments are part of every couple's life. They can occur due to a hundred reasons related to stress, work, accumulation of little things, or simply because it's just not a good day.<br/><br/>Marriage Story doesn't deliver a hopeful message or a sweet story because that's not what divorces are. It's not difficult to imagine how hard it is to separate yourself from the person you love(d) for years without end, even more when there's a kid involved in the process. Baumbach could have followed the genre cliches and provide moments of pure happiness, but that's not something that happens during a situation like this. It's a heart-wrenching phase to live through, and I believe that this movie is going to be thoroughly analyzed in film school in the next decade or so.<br/><br/>THE scene with Driver and Johansson going at each other exponentially harder and heavier criticism-wise is one of the most emotionally powerful dialogues of the millennium. The raw emotion and the physical movements that both actors can bring into the fight are absurdly impressive. Their chemistry is so inexplicably real. I never, not even for a single second, thought that I was watching fictional characters. Nicole and Charlie can very well be our neighbors or part of our family. Baumbach's use of long takes really elevate every single sequence, allowing the protagonists to move around the set and actually act.<br/><br/>Technically, there's no better acting this year than what Driver and Johansson deliver. Both are always moving and doing a lot of things while giving their lines. Making dinner, drinking tea, going to the bathroom, chopping a carrot, blowing their nose, standing up, sitting down, walking around the room, crying, smiling, laughing... All of this in a single take! Several times!! Scarlett shows more emotion throughout the runtime than her counterpart, but Adam proves why he's the frontrunner at the 2019's Oscars. His restraint when Charlie is trying to be polite even though he's mad, or his explosive behavior when his character decides to finally let go (excellent build-up), are some of the attributes that make his performance my favorite of the year.<br/><br/>Not trying to diminish Johansson's display. Both deliver career-best performances, in my opinion. Both deserve every award that exists. The supporting cast is also impeccable, and I know that Laura Dern (Nora Fanshaw) is probably going to be nominated. Still, the two leads are so engaging and captivating that I couldn't be impressed with anyone else. The only person to rise to the main actors' level is Noah Baumbach himself. With the best screenplay of 2019, he offers the audience an incredibly complex story, filled with subtle details and exceptional dialogue.<br/><br/>He controls the movie's pacing beautifully, and he knows the right moments to insert a little joke to lighten up the dark, depressing mood. My only issue with the film has to do with its replay value. We all have been through this situation: watching a fantastic movie, only once, and never again. Marriage Story is going to be one of those films for me. I love everything about it, but I know the chances of a rewatch are very, very small. It's a profoundly unsettling story, super uncomfortable at times, and I really don't want to go through the sadness and frustration all over again.<br/><br/>All in all, Noah Baumbach delivers what I believe to be its career-best flick, Marriage Story. With the best screenplay of 2019, as well as one the best directions, this is the closest the world is ever going to get to a realistic depiction of a divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver also give the best performances of their lives, elevating every single scene, dialogue, argument, or joke. The long takes allow them to shine and actually work as actors, moving around the set and doing domestic/job tasks, while delivering their lines. Technically, both Baumbach and the entire cast are absolutely perfect. It's an extremely emotional narrative, very depressing, sad, and even uncomfortable at times, which might scare some people off, especially if they've been through this. Despite its replay value being affected (a rewatch is very unlikely), it's a phenomenal lesson in storytelling that stays with us long after it's finished. Easily, one of the best movies of 2019. Don't miss it, and try not to cry."

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver definitely deserves an Oscar nod for this performance. This is my favourite Scarlett Johansson performance till date (I haven't seen Jojo Rabbit yet).

"jadepietro","10","5","8","8 December 2019"," Where Love Has Gone
","GRADE: A<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A searing indictment about divorce that devastates in the subtlest of ways.<br/><br/>
JIM'S REVIEW: I openly wept at the conclusion of Noah Baumbach's deeply disturbing Marriage Story, a lacerating portrait of love lost. This highly personal account of divorce ranks among the best films of this or any year.<br/><br/>Mr. Baumbach creates a story about two good but wounded people that is raw in its emotion and brutally honest in its treatment. There are so many small intimate moments throughout this gripping film with which one can easily identify to so many couples who lives suddenly take different paths. Such is the case of Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), two successful New York theater types who seem to be going through the paces of their marriage.<br/><br/>The film begins brilliantly with voiceover narration and shared glimpses of happier times with the Barber family. We hear each of the couple's loving words about each character's positive traits, although Nicole is unwillingly to state her feelings aloud. Their marital troubles intensify when she decides to leave Charlie's theater company and moves to Los Angeles for an acting gig in a television pilot, taking their eight year old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), with her while Charlie stays in New York to ready his Broadway directorial debut. Their bicoastal relationship quickly dissolves. Like so many well-intentioned couples, their aim is to split amicably, but they helplessly free-fall into a biased legal system that systematically destroy the lives of families already in pain.<br/><br/>This is Mr. Baumbach's finest film to date. His resume is growing more and more impressive. His direction here is flawless and his screenplay is even more impressive in its well-played words and somewhat cruel actions. As screenwriter, he does stack the deck slightly against Nicole and her possible manipulation of their situation and allows Charlie to automatically become a tragic victim of circumstances. But that is a minor issue in Mr. Baumbach's concise and insightful storytelling. His tale of marriage and its flip side is mesmerizing. This all builds to a gut-wrenching confrontation scene between the warring couple that is the film's highlight (or perhaps lowlight just might be a better term). The overall effect of their marital loss ranks with some of the best films about divorce ever made. Family-based dramas like Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, Robert Benton's Kramer vs. Kramer, or Stanley Donan's Two for the Road come to mind.<br/><br/>The ensemble is exceptional. Laura Dern plays Nora Farshaw, Nicole's barracuda of a divorce lawyer. Her performance is spot-on and she delivers a wild and cynical view of life, especially in her overt rant about motherhood that is simultaneously funny and very sad. Alan Alda and Ray Liotta skillfully depict two versions of L.A. divorce lawyers that show the inter trappings of the law system so perversely accurate. Julie Hagerty and Marritt Weaver play Nicole's mother and sister and they both offer solid support in their smaller roles. As the Barber's son, young Mr. Robertson delivers a natural and compelling performance as a confused and angry child caught in his parent's battle for control.<br/><br/>But it is Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver who ground the film with all their blistering pain and rage. Their acting is simply superb. In the more difficult role, Ms. Johansson portrays a woman thwarted by her life choices and yearning for more. At times, her character must be vulnerable or selfish and the actress is unafraid to show Nicole's uglier side. It is a fearless performance. Mr. Driver's Charlie goes through more of a metamorphosis and his arc is extremely moving. The actor shows his character's frustration, his insatiable need for self expression at the cost of wife's need for equality, and his ongoing inability to connect his feelings with her demands. He is outstanding. Both actors deliver their best performances in their already established careers which should be remembered this award season.<br/><br/>Bad things do happen to good people and Marriage Story is that poignant love story worth retelling. This thought provoking film concludes full circle in two bittersweet scenes that reveal the cost of love and the tragedy of a failed marriage. Mr. Baumbach and company deserve all the accolades for their powerful cinematic statement. Marriage Story is one of the year's best dramas. By all means, go! And bring your tissues with you."

","It is NOT easy to make a film about divorce that is funny and generous and touching as it breaks your heart. But clearly it is possible - this movie proves it. This is Baumbach at his absolute BEST (and most honest). The performances and direction are both great, but it is the writing that really steals the show. All these characters are so human, in the best and worst ways. That can make watching hard, but it makes it a joy too. Even as you watch the legal system attempt to swallow up a family, you never stop seeing yourself and you never stop caring. It is absolutely beautiful."
"novacasa42","10","5","8","8 December 2019"," A triumph for realism
","""Marriage story"" is a true description of married life is all about, the good parts and bad ones alike, Noah Baumbach the director is a master at capturing dialogues realistically and naturally, thus helping the narrative to have a sort of essence that's very undeniable and very gripping, the words just flow effortlessly in a way that makes you so invested in what's being said, there's waste in scenes, everything means something and ultimately affects the surroundings, very much like life itself, it is extremely refreshing to be a witness of that.
Having said all of that, the story itself is very poignant and it feels like that as well, as we are presented with a situation no one wants to be in, it's a back and forth of pain and pleasure that goes a long way at times, ""Johanson"" opposite ""Driver"" is a sight to behold, their interactions are pure and honest but more importantly real, you don't get to take sides in their problem as well as they both make a good case and put forth good arguments to their difficulties, one other thing I noticed is that it invites you to understand but never forces you to accept it in any way, all of this comes together to describe or at least try to understand the intricacies of a loving marriage.
After the credit rolled out, I found myself clapping at the screen almost involuntary, it sparked a reaction out of me, arguably Johanson and Driver best performances to date and I hope they get rewarded for it, This is original filmmaking at its finest, outstanding and brilliant film and I very much loved it."

"richarddillomes","8","3","4","22 March 2020"," Ugliness of divorce beautifully told.
","Marriage Story is based on the divorce of Writer-Director Noah Baumbach and actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (who I just watched a couple of days ago in Annihilation, another Netflix movie.) It also borrows from Baumbach's parent's divorce, and also from Scarlett Johansson who was going through her second divorce when she was approached for the film. Laura Dern is also a divorcee (shared the same lawyer with Scarlett which Dern's character is loosely based on,) and Adam Driver's parents were also divorced, so when Baumbach said this movie is theirs as much as his, he acknowledges the integral inputs they all gave in making this movie. For a drama, it's not dragging and had its funny moments but it also showed the very ugly side of divorce. One character said: ""Criminal lawyers see bad people at their best, divorce lawyers see good people at their worst."" It's a business in making look people bad, hitting each other on technicalities and if necessary, go down to the level of magnifying small mistakes as life-threatening ones, all in the name of getting custody of a child they both say they love very much.<br/><br/>
The movie is very much about Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, both of whom bear an uncanny resemblance to Baumbach and Leigh. Adam who I first saw in HBO's Girls, I thought I hated him but also fell in love with which is a testament to his acting ability. In 2019 we saw him both as Kylo Ren in Star Wars Episode IX and Marriage Story, and there's really no way but up for him in the years to come. Scarlett Johansson is good as usual, but her comment about being able to play whatever role she wants still rubs me off in the wrong way. Laura Dern was superb, shining brightly even as a supporting role. Her performance here is a mix of her The Fault in our Stars cool mom and her 'Big Little Lies' vicious mom. It even has a dash of the cunning Vice Admiral Holdo from Star Wars Episode IX.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the confrontation between the couple. It became more impressive after reading how it was done in 50 takes in two days. They had to finish each take before starting over, and no improvisations were allowed. Everything was scripted, even their pauses. From time to time the director will hand them notes to elicit a different reaction. Other highlights include the scene where Driver's character reads the letter Johansson's character wrote describing him and the litany of Dern's character as to why women are held to higher standards: women are compared to Mary who did everything for Jesus while men are held to standards of Joseph who was an absentee father. Compelling stuff right there."
"goodwina-13851","10","3","4","20 March 2020"," Emotional and Powerful View of Divorce
","The film I am reviewing is ""Marriage Story"". This is a story about a couple going through a divorce. The main characters, Nicole and Charlie, are played by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. The theme deals with the truth of human nature. People change over time and so do their feelings. Although, you can tell they both still have a lot of love for each other but are just not on the same page anymore. They want to divorce, yet they both are very focused on the well-being of their son, Henry, played by Azhy Robertson. Which, the movie begins with a voice-over narration of both characters stating what they love about the other. They are in a therapy session with their marriage counselor. I feel this worked with the theme because the movie starts towards the end of their relationship. So, this is a way to introduce them both to us.
Nicole is originally from California but moved to New York so Charlie could have his theater career. He is now a successful director and Nicole performs in his plays, despite her desire to return to California and pursue her own acting career. In addition, she learned through some of Charlie's emails that he had sex with a woman from the theater. Nicole ends up getting a job in LA and takes Henry with her to her mother's (played by Julie Hagerty). The job was supposed to be short-term and Nicole would return to New York. They initially agreed to work everything out on their own; to not get lawyers involved. However, at the advice of a co-worker, Nicole decides to seek the help of a tough LA attorney, Nora Fanshaw (played by Laura Dern). Charlie then learns he now has to seek counsel, but in LA. He first goes to a tough, expensive lawyer Jay Marotta (played by Ray Liotta). Charlie initially decides not to hire him because of his expensive fees and due to the things he says Charlie will have to claim in order to win the case. An editorial technique used in this film was jump cuts. In this scene, once Henry hears all of this from Jay, he decides he is leaving LA and going back to New York. In the next scene, he is back at the theater in New York. When he returns to LA, he gets referred to an ex-entertainment lawyer who now practices family law by the name of Bert Spitz (played by Alan Alda). After their first meeting with Nicole and her lawyer, Bert advices him to settle and he feels like that's not good enough. It was important to him that Henry knew he fought for him. So, he goes back to Jay and shows up with him at the court hearing. Court becomes nasty as both lawyers try to paint a negative picture of each in order to win. Charlie and Nicole both grow tired and eventually come to an agreement with the divorce and go on to be happy in their own lives and as a family, still.
This movie is a good insight on marriage and what happens during divorce. I learned a lot about the laws that I didn't know. I also was able to see how divorce affects the men. This movie was very emotional and the subjective point of view shots really put you in the character's shoes. You're able to see things through their eyes and really feel their emotion."

","Seeing the last wets eyes, a long, cumbersome, sometimes tearful and sometimes tender American divorce, although the breakdown of the relationship was not easy to be decent, they still gave each other and their children a lot of love. Although the US system is complicated and sometimes ridiculous (such as sending an observer to observe the father's flustering and embarrassment when getting along with the child), it is still very humane in general, and ca n't live together and is still the closest family member. Refusing to acknowledge existing feelings. In terms of actors, the widow's performance has been very stylized, and she can't get out of the set she has already been in full swing; and the male lead Adam is the treasure actor. He is too good and the play is all on him. A lot of sparkling performances, a lot of golden lines, a lot of humorous moments, a sad and quite humorous film, put forward new thinking on modern husband and wife relationship: ""Virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus as a virgin, and people demand women Immaculate, but what about Jesus 'father?

","I think the first film I remember crying at was Kramer v Kramer; I don't know how old I was, but I remember being in the same room as it when the TV was showing it one Christmas. I don't think I fully understood it - but I know what stayed with me so powerfully was the way I sensed it articulating something of my own fear of my own parents splitting up. Not that I ever had any reason to think that would happen - it didn't. But I remember the fear.<br/><br/>Many years and 20 years of my own marriage later, Marriage Story doesn't evoke the same fear, but it does evoke both a kind of sadness as to the way it portrays what so many go through, a kind of recognition of the sort of slow escalations that all of us experience in almost any sort of relationship. It's the simple - yet complex - story of a couple's marriage in breakdown ... they start in couple's counselling and ends in divorce, following the negotiation of the details along the way.<br/><br/>It seems odd to cast the film among the performance industry - he is a theatre director, she an actress; at times that's in danger of tipping the film into the sort of conflicts most of us don't have to deal with, but in the end there's enough truth there to make this feel like an 'everyman' sort of relationship.<br/><br/>The whole film hints occasionally at the heightened realities of musicals - the framing, the tight close-ups and tracking shots following the long speeches of one or the other, maybe even the colour palette at times suggesting the 1950s/60s musicals golden era. When Adam Driver's character, near the film's end, sings a Sondheim song in a bar, that sense is bought closer to the heart; like musicals, the film is unashamed in trying to move us and does so.<br/><br/>Much of this is quite remarkable - Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are outstanding, both of them simultaneously sympathetic and repellant, highlighting the reality that the film doesn't force us to choose one side or the other; or if it does, the way we jump is down to our own biased, not the film's. The film's standout moment, an argument that starts amicably and ends in words that can't be unsaid, is the sort of sequence you feel as if you're privy to someone else's private pain, laundry that should only aired in private hung out for all to see. It's remarkable in performance, direction and writing - and everything else besides.<br/><br/>The film also mines comedy out of some of the most painful situations; the moment Adam Driver's character is served with divorce papers is almost farce-like in its execution, yet the tonal shift within the scene never jars. Much within the film is funny, because people are funny; there's always a hint of joy, even in the midst of great pain.<br/><br/>This, I think, is where the hope in the film comes from; given where we are almost certain the film will end right from the first scene, the light touches of humour and the moments of clarity amidst the recriminations, claims and counterclaims point us to the human capacity to be better versions of ourselves even when so much seems to be falling around us. Like the best films, it's never one thing entirely - it's a love story about a divorce, a drama with very good jokes and comedic scenes, a musical with only one song. It's a film about one particular relationship, that allows us to see every relationship (not just marital ones) in a fresh light."

It's also really well-shot and well-edited. This is one of those rare movies where there really isn't anything bad about it at all. Well, maybe the score is a little weird and distracting sometimes. It's composed by Randy Newman and sounds right out of a Pixar movie. Wallace Shawn of The Incredibles and Toy Story fame is even in it. It seems out-of-place sometimes, but the rest of the movie is so good I think I can overlook it. Overall, this movie is a must-see and I hope it wins some Oscars!"

","Why did this film get so many Oscar nominations? Good question. Yes, I do think it was well done with some excellent performances, but not as spectacular as the Academy and others seem to believe.
One of the things that troubled me was I thought the character of Nicole changed much too quickly from being ""wimpy"" and dependent to being assertive and her own person. Literally it seemed to happen overnight.
Also, I wasn't expecting a film called ""Marriage Story"" to be about a divorce, but of course it was about a marriage leading to divorce.
I also want to comment on some of the reviews I've read here by male viewers. Several of them seem to feel that Charlie, Adam Driver's character, got the raw end of the deal in the film. One reviewer even referred to the ""gynocentric world"" we live in. This made me realize something: that it's in the area of children that women for the most part have an advantage. Perhaps it's the only area in which this is true. How anyone could call our world ""gynocentric"" when women have been oppressed and still are for centuries all around the world. shows a male ignorance of the particularly heinous type. But it was kind of heartening to realize that yes, there is one area of life in which women do have an advantage, or edge.
The film is worth seeing if you want an emotional experience because it does deliver that. Beyond that? I don't think so."

"iquine","9","3","4","24 January 2020"," Sobering Raw Reality of Spiraling Sadness
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>If you want to see pure acting front and center with cuts long enough to let actors dive deep, then this fits the bill. Early in the film you see a husband and a wife sitting with a marriage counselor lightly trying to save their marriage amicably. Following that there is no surprise for guessing the trend the film will take. The path the story takes smashes any facade the characters have built and drives to the core of their internal feelings and feelings for each other. It is sobering to watch the couple's relationship escalate in negative intensity. The raw acting takes center stage due to smart yet non-flashy cinematography. This doubles as a PSA for not hiring lawyers for divorce cases as they are portrayed as vile scum. Those seeking acting should not miss this."
"zionmaly-78602","9","3","4","19 January 2020"," Solid B plus. So, I rounded up.
","Marriage Story I think is a very personal movie for a lot of people. It discusses one of probably the heaviest things to happen to a couple, and having a children in the middle of it can be even more difficult. I personally haven't had a divorce but I am a product of divorced parents. So, in a way I as a child of two divorced parents am reaping the divorce in a way as well.<br/><br/>This movie could have easily flopped and just been a tragic cheesy love story between Charlie and Nicole, however, having it be a film by Noah Baumbach, someone who isn't new to making movies about divorce, it was executed extremely well, in my opinion.<br/><br/>To start the review of the film off, I really enjoyed the acting in this film. I thought both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson's performances are Oscar nominated worthy. Having just seen the total bomb Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I'll admit it was weird seeing Adam Driver playing a dad. However, I think his portrayal of Charlie was done well. Reminded me of my POS dad (love you though). Johansson's Nicole and Driver's Charlie really complimented one another in this film and their chemistry was believable. I really like the scene, it's rather popular on twitter, where they have the argument in Charlie's apartment and he tells her, ""I wish you were dead"" then proceeds to pathetically punch a dent in the dry wall was so riveting and engaging. The little things in the writing are what really make this script so great and I feel as if you're an upcoming screenwriter this script shouldn't be slept on.<br/><br/>They really could've just made a movie about a couple once in love separating, however, instead they show the legal side of things and really how nasty a divorce is. How expensive it can be and how much it really ruins your life. Being only 20 years old this movie has definitely scared me off from ever getting married in the future. And I love how casual Charlie and Nicole's lawyers are between one another. They act like they're friends from work. And that makes sense since they're both seemingly to be expensive divorce lawyers.<br/><br/>I'm really a big fan of Noah Baumbach's style and his films in general. If you enjoyed Marriage story and are curious if there's any other movies like this I would recommend his earlier work titled, The Squid and the Whale.<br/><br/>My mom refuses to watch this movie. She tells me everytime I tell her to watc hit, ""i lived through it, why would I want to watch that?"""
"christinablaney","7","3","4","18 January 2020"," Watch for the great acting not the story
","It's about a divorce. That's all you need to know. But the acting from Driver and Johansen really is special and they deserve the Oscar noms, but not sure why the hell Laura Dern got one, she essentially plays the same character she was in big little lies.
There's some laugh out loud moments and a lot of sad. No tears from me but I'm sure most would.
It's true you can't pick sides in it, but everyone blaming her... HE SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN!?"
"michaeltrivedi","7","3","4","16 January 2020"," Good
","This movie seems to be less about the people involved, and more about LA and NY. I got that vibe watching it. A couple is getting divorced, and we are introduced to their lives. But they don't seem to be the main attraction here. They have long winded speeches which really go nowhere and make no difference. And they meet people who are also just people who make no difference. It's the entire painting that's important, like an abstract piece. There's a story sure, but it's something else above it all that's going on. Not sure what it is actually.<br/><br/>The movie is good though. It's about a husband and wife getting a divorce. The man is an acclaimed playwriter, and the woman is an actress. There really is no plot. They get a divorce, and have to adjust. That's it.<br/><br/>I thought Scarlett was incredible in the scenes I paid attention to. She has such a unique look I wouldn't call beautiful, but a smile that would catch anyone's attention. Adam Driver is just a guy, stern and serious. Just an ordinary, nobody type guy. It also has family stuff involved in it which is nice too.<br/><br/>I liked it. I thought it was great. A good watch. I would definitely watch it again sometime.<br/><br/>7 stars"
"chinhy-62892","7","3","4","16 January 2020"," it's OK, not SUPER good
","Performance from Scarlet Johansson and Adam Driver may be pretty solid, but the argument scene that is supposed to be the movie's climax is really poorly written. Two characters reasonably articulating their thoughts about each other and their past is really NOT something that looks realistic. (Not even CLOSE compared to confrontation scene between Leonardo Dicarprio and Kate Winslet in Revolutionary Road).<br/><br/>Performance of Laura Dern is just overrated like the film itself. Quite exaggerated in my opinion. Not a bad film just doesn't deserve THAT much praise."

And the story is actually a truth in everyday life all over the world in every cultures and countries; this kind of stupidity which lots of couples have and in this case it leads to divorce, is over than any particular culture and everyone can feel it as if they see everywhere... these are actually clear and there's even more... it's just another kind of perfect movie about relationships and miss understanding of both genders about each other; Well, actually it seems to me.

","Yes, the couple gets divorced.
Yes, they struggle over the custody of their child.
Yes, things get nasty.
Yes, some (not all) of the lawyers are a**holes.<br/><br/>But despite all that, I still found myself thoroughly engaged with this film. The script is great. It will still shock you and may even move you to tears. The whole thing feels very real, like your are wrapped right up in it. This is also conveyed through the realism of the characters. It may be a little biased towards the father (the film is based on his own divorce), but if you watch closely you will see he does not hide all his flaws as a father or husband.<br/><br/>Overall- great but not perfect<br/><br/>P.S: Right now it's pretty popular to make fun of the acting on Twitter, and I will admit that one fight scene is a little over the top. But its a single scene (towards the very end of the film!) taken completely out of context. It's lost all of the build up, and therefore looks much more flat than it really is."
"blackrose909","7","3","4","23 December 2019"," Great acting, but character and plot writing lacking
","I expected this movie to be moved more than it was. Adam Driver is a real stand-out, but both leads had more to offer that the writing did not flesh out. Neither character were particularly flawed or inspiring and thus, neither were very endearing when they really could have been. My parents got divorced when I was 7 so I don't think it's the lack of context that's missing for me.<br/><br/>I compare this to something like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where the actors are raw. I feel that Noah Baumbach did not get the best out of the actors, who are capable of more. The plot was extremely slow in many parts and the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter, without losing any value.<br/><br/>I'm basically agreeing with one of the previous reviews that the acting was great, was the writing was mediocre when it could have been amazing. So much potential in a drama like this and so sad to see the wasted talent."
"samwillpearce","8","3","4","20 December 2019"," An Ode to Real Life
","From the jarring first scene to the hopeful finale, ""Marriage Story"" is a simple, honest, yet entertaining film about life as it is--it's the kind of film we need more of.<br/><br/>There's a lot that's done wonderfully about this movie, from the performances by the leads and the supporting cast (Laura Dern is an underappreciated star of the film), meaningful commentary on gender and relationships, and unromantic, realistic depictions of marriage and divorce. It is visually appealing and vintage feeling. It remains entertaining throughout despite the infinite mundanities of divorce law. It refuses to force the audience to pick a side in the divorce: both protagonists feel very realistic, complex, and the right mixture of good and bad. There is no winner or loser in the movie, no good and evil, just two people realizing they aren't right for each other.<br/><br/>That, I think, is the most poignant and powerful element of this film. There is no absolute right or wrong in the divorce, no clear antagonist other than human stupidity. Films often depict an unhealthy view of relationships and love; one where two people sort out their issues and then there are never problems again, one where a lasting marriage is the ultimate goal of life, one where every ended relationship is a devastating tragedy. ""Marriage Story"" says just the opposite. It depicts Nicole and Charlie's divorce not as a failure, but simply as a new chapter in their lives. Though they are incredibly sad and broken up about their marriage ending, it is not the end of their lives. Nicole and Charlie don't just matter when they're a couple; they each have unique and immeasurable merit on their own. They're both beautiful and flawed human beings like anyone else. They have not failed by splitting up, they have simply become more themselves. In an age where many biases and norms of the past are unraveling, ""Marriage Story"" is the encouragement that we need that the ""truths"" we've been taught by norms of the past do not have to apply to us. What matters most is that our lives are happy and meaningful.<br/><br/>For a film largely about divorce, ""Marriage Story"" is surprisingly sweet, funny, and optimistic, and ultimately very meaningful and impactful. One of my favorite films of the year to be sure, and one that I'll certainly return to in the future."

It was confusing. However, like many things in life there are often more than one side to things; I soon realized that some of my assumptions and conclusions during the early stages of the movie were not wrong but rather incomplete.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and even though some aspects were not necessarily relatable I found some scenes to be timeless and emotionally captivating."

More sad and depressing is the conduct of the two attorneys in representing their respective clients. Dern and Liotta vis a vis Baumbach nailed it. I wish I could say that the lawyer characters are a gross exaggeration and/or caricature of how divorce attorneys conduct themselves."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","4","16 December 2019"," Two riveting lead performances
","It would seem natural to start talking about ""Marriage Story"" with something like ""there is life beyond Kylo Ren and Natasha Romanoff"", in tribute to the two leads progressing from blockbuster pop icons to Oscar calibre performers. But I am going to start with director-writer Noah Baumback first.<br/><br/>In 2005, I watched ""The squid and the whale"", also written and directed by Baumback, earning him Sundance awards for both these categories, although none of the more glamorous awards for which it was also nominated. I beg indulgence is excerpts from my IMDb user review of that movie.<br/><br/>""This is a very realistic, honest depiction of the drama of life. The fact that it is so good is due very much to its very close to being writer-director Noah Baumbach's auto-biography"" I thus described ""The squid and the whale"". These comments applies equally to ""Marriage story"".<br/><br/>""The squid and the whale"" is also about a failed marriage, as we the audience we see ""the characters' struggles throughout the movie, against themselves and against each other, to find a balance in a life that will go on. At various times, you learn to like or dislike these characters, but never without a sense of sympathy for their helplessness. In the end, you have a deeper understanding that life sometimes does take such turns, and you recognize it in people around you, some of whom you know quite well."" So much for ""The squid and the whale"", which for most part is from the POV of the young children. ""Marriage story"" goes directly and unflinchingly into the couples' inner world.<br/><br/>While many also compare ""Marriage story"" to ""Kramer vs Kramer"", there are significant difference. While the key plotline for both is custodianship battle, ""Kramer"" is also very much a father-and-son bonding story, maybe even more so. In ""marriage story"", on the other hand, the son is neutral and seems equally agreeable to living with the father or mother. In Kramer, the Oscar wins were Best Lead Actor for Dustin Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for Merly Streep. For ""Marriage story"" is will be most surprising if Adam Driver (playing Charles) and Scarlette Johansson (playing Nicole) are not both nominated for their respective lead roles.<br/><br/>I won't go into the details of how what started as a perfect marriage ends up failing. The general verdict of critics seems that neither is entirely at fault. It's just one of those things. So, let's leave it at that.<br/><br/>What I final most moving in this movie is the light touches (and Baumback is superb with those) that make your heart bleed in hoping that they would get back together after all: such as in the lunch break in the meeting at the legal office Charles stares at the menu, completely at a loss and Nicole takes it off his hand and orders for him; such as at a brief evening visit Nicole observes Charles's ""shaggy"" appearance and ends upon cutting his hair for him (something she has always done for the family); such as at the closing scene (after the custodian dispute has been resolved reasonably amicably), Nicole notices that Charles's shoelace is loose, calls him to stop and ties it up for him (he is holding their son, going away to spend a day with him). There are many such touches, as I call them, but the most heart-breaking thing is to see the two of them, in a throng of people, exchanging glances and gazes as if they are the only two persons in the world.<br/><br/>To-date, ""Marriage story"" has collected 35 awards and earned close to 100 nominations. As I said, it is almost a certainty that both Driver and Johansson will be nominated for best lead role in Oscar. If they both win it will be well-deserved, not only for their heart-felt, nuanced performances throughout but also for an emotionally explosive scene in the middle that leaves the audiences breathless and sobbing at the same time. There is a solid support cast, of which the three lawyers are most noteworthy. Honoured with a Golden Globe support nomination is Laura Dern playing Nicole's super-aggressive lawyer Nora. Hall-of-fame class veteran Alan Alda plays Charles's first lawyer Bert, semi-retired and eventually fired for being too soft. Picking thing up from him is Jay, a lawyer worth Nora's steel, played by veteran screen tough guy Ray Liotta."

"airborne_trooper","8","3","4","14 December 2019"," Solid but not without its flaws
","This movie tackles the complexity of divorce without pulling any punches. Where this move excels is it's raw approach to the ugliness of separation and how even the most genuinely kind people can turn into the worst version of themselves all for the sake of a ""win"". Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver strong, believable performances of a married couple who became a union for their own selfish reasons but likely had no business even dating letting alone getting married.<br/><br/>Where this movie tends to fail however, despite it's title, is in the actual story. There's just no real direction or goal to what goes on here. Nicole, (Johansson's character) does a brief overview of what brought them together and broke them up. But the true lynchpin of what destroyed them, is for whatever reason a bit of an afterthought, only mentioned sparingly throughout the film. At times they seem like they're on the verge of saying ""let's just make this work"" only to wipe it all away with something truly awful said or done.<br/><br/>Once you kinda know where this story is headed which is fairly early into the second act, while intriguing, you're kinda just waiting to see how it'll all play out and it begins to drag. Some scenes are either needlessly elongated or completely unnecessary altogether. I do however absolutely love the ""real life"" comedy that happens. They did really well with making funny moments seem natural.<br/><br/>The strength and weakness of this movie is in its realness. Our lives are real and art tries like hell to imitate it, only to realize not every waking moment of it is even remotely entertaining. This movie seems to wallow in these moments of realness that don't happen to necessarily be entertaining and it's where this movie sags.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Marriage Story thoroughly and after seeing this and finally seeing ""Her"", I've grown a full blown new respect for Scarlett Johansson's acting prowess. But this movie lacks a true point and seems to only hinge itself on something (married or not) we all know too well; the pain of separating from someone you once immensely cared about. It relates greatly enough to pull you in for the duration, but upon reflection, you realize it's not as great as it seems. Seems to be more anguish for the sake of anguish, rather than anguish to illustrate a point. Don't get me wrong, there are revelations to be had, but without a true direction in this movie, you're kind left wondering what the point of it all even was, especially factoring in the ""ending"". If you can call it that."

","REVIEW of the ""Marriage Story""
To fully grasp the meaning and the quality of ""Marriage Story"" some essential relationship issues need to be explained. Relationship changes over the years. What starts as lustful need to sexually connect with another human being, transforms over the years to more of a partnership relation.
Our relations with our children permit us to exercise the demons of our childhood and being parent, this time in power position, it helps us heal the wounds our parent did to us.
Using Freudian logic and his ""penis envy"" theory it points that woman on a subconscious level envy man, because of their strength and resilience associating masculinity with stability and femininity with being weak and unstable. However from another view point, its the feminine sensibility is what brings nourishment and ability to raise a child in environment that is being protective over the offspring. Children come out of female womb therefor on subconscious level are part of mother's body.
Once woman give birth, there is often change in their character. By fulfilling their motherhood duties, as they age woman cut their hair short which gives them more masculine feeling. They might start to resent their male partner for not paying the same amount of attention and start to look for proverbial plan ""B"". Man as they age loose testosterone and eventually want to prove to themselves that they still got it and invest their interest in trivial things like fast cars and even faster younger woman. Both parties start to resent one another for sacrifices they had to make for their families and eventually grow apart searching for that other person that would bring back that feeling of being worshiped once again.
I was unsure If I will like ""Marriage Story"". Over 2 hour long story of an actress and theatre director intertwined in custody battle over their son might not be for everyones linking, specially if any of you went through an actual divorce this film might be little bit too close to home, so to speak.
Also this movie is very dialog heavy and often feels like a theatre play with actors regurgitating long amounts of text, which is used as the main source of exposition. At one point I felt like I am watching Woody Allen movie minus the neuroses and sarcasm. But as you are investing your time in getting to know your protagonists you start to understand them on a deeper level. Its the performances that hold this film together. Both Driver and Johnsson deliver deep heartfelt performances rooted in something real. But even supporting cast works very well as an unusable.<br/><br/>In terms of filmmaking this film will not win any major awards. The cinematography is not ""Marriage Story"" strongest point, in fact it lacks imagination making it look like a theatre play, but this film shouldn't be seen for an eye candy that isn't, but for acting performances alone.
There is an Oscar buzz around Driver's performance and I was curious if its justified. And indeed it is. There is specially one scene in the apartment where Scarlett comes to try to mediate with Adam to find peaceful solution to their costly divorce, which takes turn in to blaming game of why their life turned out the way it did. They both are mesmerizing here but Driver connects his rage to something real from his personal past which makes audience feel like they are the fly on the wall and are witnessing something very intimate they were not suppose to see. Confrontation between two people who underneath love one another.<br/><br/>Scarlett's character wanted to be individual, not part of overbearing somewhat narcissistic personality of her husband. Actors are like children, they want to play, deep down inside looking for an approval from their parent figure - director, who is there to help them conceive their performance.
But in her performance Scarlett resents him for loosing interest in her although as they have opportunities to be with other people they are still connected in sense of belonging to one another.
Bottom line ""Marriage Story"" isn't a perfect movie by any means, but thanks to very good cast and smart writing as well as brilliant performances it elevates it beyond my expectation.
And yes Adam Driver will get Oscar nomination and perhaps Scarlett might steal one two.

Heart wrenching to watch if you've been there, but even if not, one can't help feeling for the characters. No political bs, no man vs. woman, just real life. The depiction of the legal struggle wasn't over done, but struck all the chords-the writer is to be commended, and the actors as well. Tough subject to get through but content at the end."

Both of them should be nominated for Best actor and actress. Obviously the big talk about this movie are the Performances but this movie tells a story about what I'm sure happens to a lot of couples. Their jobs get in the way from them trying to be a parent and when getting divorced they use that against you. This movies screenplay alone is what makes this movie. The dialogue is almost perfect. I don't see this movie losing in the Oscar Screenplay category.(unless another great writer, Tarantino, wins). Even though I think Adam Driver gives his best performance of his Career in this movie. I do think he loses to Joaquin at the Oscars. Scarlett who is strong, gives another STRONGER performance in a different movie this year. Overall, watch this movie if you want to see World Class acting and a powerful story."

","There is a lot of Woody Allen, especially in the dialogues, but this does not detract from Noah's good work, on the contrary it enriches him with the typical elements of American divorce drama. And then shooting (metaphorically!) On the pile come to mind Husbands and wives (just to stay in the Alleniano area), The war of the Roses (all the love that turns into hate), Kramer against Kramer (when it's out of the way the son) ... but all the good cinephiles will find it in abundance. But here the difference is the feminine vision that director Baumbach makes of it, entrusting to Johansson (often without make-up and without too much sex appeal) the torment for a decision made and the affirmation, finally, to think about his life without annihilation due to falling in love.
The only discordant note, for a film that is otherwise well packaged, is the singing insert of the protagonist who wants to demonstrate his fragility for the experience he lived in front of his theater company.
A final, entirely subjective consideration: from an actor's point of view, the presence of Adam Driver exceeds all of a head!"

","First Hit: Well-acted story about a challenging process that many people go through - divorce.<br/><br/>This is a story about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), who met in Los Angeles and moved to New York City, where Charlie was living. Then they got married, worked together in Charlie's theater company, and had a young child, a boy named Henry (Azhy Robertson).<br/><br/>Over time, the story has Nicole becoming lost in Charlie's shadow. Although she is the star of all his stage productions, she feels overshadowed. She's also a long way from her LA family and her family home. Her mother and father were in show business, and before meeting Charlie, Nicole had received some fame for one of her television appearances.<br/><br/>As they contemplate the divorce, there seems to be an unspoken agreement that they will do this amicably. It is spoken that they both want the best for Henry and that both want to be involved in raising Henry.<br/><br/>During the opening scenes showing each of them in brief scenes while a voiceover has each of them stating what they like, love, or struggle with the other person. As the scene unfolds into a current moment, they are both sitting in front of a marriage counselor mediator. Each of them has been asked to read these statements about the other. Charlie is ready willing and able; Nicole is not and storms out of the office.<br/><br/>This made me wonder about some other underlying cause of her wanting to end the marriage. We do learn later that Charlie had a one-time affair with one of the people in his theater company.<br/><br/>The film takes a journey across the US from New York City to Los Angeles, where Nicole and Henry visit her mother. She has decided to stay there, despite her acting in the couples' latest play heading to Broadway.<br/><br/>Charlie travels out to visit Henry. While in LA, he learns that Nicole has seen an aggressive attorney Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), who is pushing to make this divorce contentious. When he's served with divorce papers, he feels blindsided. To protect his interests, Charlie engages a Los Angeles lawyer, Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta), who wants a $25K retainer to come up with a plan to make sure Charlie gets his son Harry in New York.<br/><br/>However, the aggressiveness of the whole thing turns Charlie off, so he engages a new, more passive attorney Bert Spitz (Alan Alda). During a discussion with Nicole and Nora, Charlie realizes things are out of control for him.<br/><br/>The film then moves to tell what happens to Charlie and Nicole as they go through the divorce court process and the subsequent fallout. A touching scene towards the end shows Henry reading Nicole's list of traits to Charlie, and Nicole is standing near the door listening in. Very touching.<br/><br/>Driver is excellent as Charlie. The scene in the bar when he's singing to his theater company employees was wonderfully staged and felt very real. Johansson was terrific as Nicole. I felt as though she captured questioning being swallowed up in Charlie's life well. Robertson, as Henry, was enjoyable as Charlie and Nicole's child. Dern was strong as an attorney who wanted her client to win on all counts. Alda was okay as the passive attorney who tried to weave the least obstructive way through the divorce. Liotta was powerful as Charlie's aggressive attorney. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this sensitive and sophisticated look at divorce.<br/><br/>Overall: This film touched many divorce subjects and implications both sensitively and effectively."

His performances by the leading duo is totally excellent, the only unfavorable point of this is that Adam in the climax scene steals the role of Scarlett, since it is his character that seems to do the catharsis, obscuring the catharsis of Scarlett , making him feel like this only as a complement in the scene. It seems to me that the greatest virtue of the film is, without a doubt, its script: a script that not only feels light and skillful for the viewer, but feels fresh for the exhibition of the story. I find it eloquent. Totally symbolic and subtle to give the messages of selfishness, megalomania and apathy that are often lived in couples. It is also sublime criticism anti-lawyers and anti-capitalism, showing that putting material and whims before feelings is the ruin of this society, increasingly decadent. 83%."

"TheVictoriousV","8","3","4","9 December 2019"," The perfect medicine for those who want life to be like the movies is a movie that's like life
","Netflix's Marriage Story came to me at a funny time in my life and I will disclose no more personal facts than that. It is the first Noah Baumbach project I have given my full attention - unless we count the Wes Anderson films he's worked on, as well as, of course, Madagascar 3 - and I gather it is a semi-autobiographical tale about how love stories may end. Not with fireworks, but with divorce papers, custody battles, and costly meetings where, sometimes, the two partners are truly taught to hate each other. This, according to Tim Grierson, is what Baumbach tells us of the ""Divorce-Industrial Complex"".<br/><br/>This is the sort of movie that many will berate in that it is insufficiently glamorous and escapist, the way movie-films ""should be"" (it features hot celebs in unflattering, very human scenarios). But I'd say the perfect medicine for those who want life to be like the movies is a movie that's like life. Or at least, how life may turn out if two people fail in their devotion, or are told that they did; to quote Grierson, ""the happiest people in this movie are the divorce attorneys"".<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are undoubtedly the biggest selling point of the project, knocking it out of the park as stage director Charles and his actress wife Nicole, going through a messy divorce that forces them to travel coast-to-coast. They are surrounded by the likes of Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Ray Liotta, and even Wallace Shawn for a little while. All of these legends do well enough that I routinely forgot I was watching a film, rather than a documented ordeal.<br/><br/>Particularly noteworthy, however, is the actor playing the couple's son. Too often, unconvincing child performers are dismissed as ""just kids"", ergo we shouldn't complain that they aren't as engaging or engaged as the adult actors - many of them veterans, to boot. Azhy Robertson comes close, however. We shouldn't ignore films like this, just as we shouldn't ignore Room and Looper.<br/><br/>marriage storeThe movie may sound dispiriting and sad as I have described it (for some, this will be therapeutic and remind them that they're not alone), but be aware that it treats a difficult scenario with a certain sense of humor. Another ostensibly depressing film I saw this year was About Endlessness, by the great Swedish auteur Roy Andersson, which was about a larger number of upsetting aspects of human life.<br/><br/>All the same, it was technically a comedy; not pointing and laughing at the subjects, but having a sense of humor about the harsh parts of existence. Baumbach, with his commentary on divorce agencies and his lifelike characters, is ultimately more serious than Roy Andersson, although we're still permitted to laugh about the messiness of it all, the way the central couple one day might. Marriage Story affirms that a romantic comedy can be more - so very much more - than the inoffensive pop entertainment we often assume rom-coms ought to be.<br/><br/>Much like The Irishman, this is another acclaimed film to get the ""limited theatrical run followed by immediate Netflix release"" treatment, further legitimizing the trend-spotting paper I wrote on the future of cinema this spring. More and more respected filmmakers are taking streaming seriously (see also Roma and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs of last year's Oscar Bait season), but I certainly believe Marvel premiere events will keep certain film theatres alive. Some theatres might also survive due to having screenings of old classics for devoted cinephiles to attend, but those types might find a substitute in the Criterion Channel.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also nice that instant online release allows me to catch more of the well-liked movies in a year and then run my mouth about them to no-one in particular. I think we'll see Baumbach at the Oscars."

","Although this is not Noah Baumbach's first dive into the divorce theme (The Squid and the Whale, 2005), Marriage Story has to be his personal masterpiece<br/><br/>Marriage Story shows how a recently separated couple deal with their divorce. We see actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) try to make sense of what is next for them, why the relationship failed and how their lives will change going forward. All this whilst fighting over where their son should live in an uglier-tan-expected divorce proceeding<br/><br/>The reason the movie involves the viewer so much is because of how real it all feels. This I can only assume is due to an outstanding script. And of course top notch actors.
But the script is so refreshing - there is an argument between the couple that lasts easily for 10 minutes. A whole scene where, much like in everyday life, the argument continues to escalate and go off in tangents which have absolutely nothing to do with the original discord. That scene and Nicole's quasi-monologue at her lawyer's office really stuck with me.<br/><br/>If you like down to earth movies about true relationship in the mundane world, that Marriage Story cannot be missed.<br/><br/>Netflix put out a title that I sincerely hope makes it to the nominees for Best Movie, it's just outstanding"

","Marriage Story
Marriage used to be primarilly a social contract. It still is a contract. It is also ""an intimate and personal relationship."" Nothing makes you more vulnerable than marriage and divorce and most of us are terrified of this. We deny it and avoid it however we can; but either way we are ""hostages to fortune"" as Francis Bacon said.<br/><br/>The contract between Charlie and Nicole starts out to be that the marriage will be bicoastal. She is from LA. Though from the Midwest, Charlie is more into theatre so we meet them in New York where he has established a successful theatre with Nicole being his usual leading lady. They have a son and Charlie has come to consider them to be a New York family. Nicole hasn't forgotten LA, and she's just been offered the opportunity to star in her own TV series to be filmed in LA, In a two careeer family who moves? Who compromises?<br/><br/>Up to this point, it's been Nicole. The original contract has not been fulfilled. They try counseling first. Each is supposed to share a list of what they love about each other. Charlie is prepared with his list and eager to share it. Nicole has also prepared a list but is not able to share it. Baumbach does not tell us why he reveals it to the discering viewer<br/><br/>The hostages believe everything can be settled amicably but inevitably stumble into their mutual vulnerabilities. It unfolds into a shatteringly climactic fight. The contract had not been fulfilled. The intimate and personal is ripping them apart. There is a son. There are custody issues, financial issues, adversarial lawyers exacerbating issues. Nicole in LA becomes alive. Charlie copes.<br/><br/>In spite of some reviewer's biases the brilliance, insight. and compassion of Baumbach takes no side. He portrays no victims nor victors. Eventually, Charlie, ironically, reads Nicole's list - to their son while Nicole watches unobserved.<br/><br/>They are no longer hostages to their contract. What they are and may continue to be is symbolized in the tying of an unlaced shoelace., Baumbach does not tell a story. He reveals one.. This is the magic of art.<br/><br/>Brilliant writing.

","When I first saw the trailer for ""Marriage Story"", I was intrigued by the concept and cast. When it started gaining buzz and racking up award nominations in droves, I knew it was something I was going to see. While there were certain parts of the film I enjoyed very much, overall I found it slightly lacking in one key area: drawing real, visceral emotion out of the viewer.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, ""Marriage Story"" is a tale about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a married couple in the beginning stages of separation/divorce. Not wanting to make things too messy for son Henry (Azhy Robertson), Charlie & Nicole want to keep things civil--until the lawyers get involved, drawing some passion out of the all sides.<br/><br/>Easily the best part of this film for me was the acting from Driver and Johansson. They both give performances that are very much award-worthy and complement each other perfectly. At one point, Driver absolutely brings down the house with his rendition of ""Being Alive"", while Johansson is a wonder to watch slowly unfurl her emotions as the movie progresses. I'd have no problem with either of them taking home some hardware during awards season.<br/><br/>The problem I had with this film, however, is that it seemed like every time it looked to be kicking into a high emotional gear, something would happen to stop that momentum in its tracks. The lawyers (played by Laura Dern, Alan Alda, & Ray Liotta) are the most egregious examples of this, as those scenes constituted easily my least favorite ones of the whole experience. They sort of turn the proceedings into ""Divorce Story"" rather than ""Marriage Story"", which throws things off track.<br/><br/>To me, the best scenes in the movie are when Driver and Johansson simple co-exist on screen together. They might end up talking very calmly with each other at first, but then the escalation continues and by the end they are screaming in frustration/rage. These are the types of scenes that win awards. Like I said, it's too bad that momentum kept getting interrupted.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, it just felt like this film was about a half-step ""off"" for me the whole way. Like all the ingredients were there for it to be really emotional, but rarely did they coalesce properly and actually do so. Like I said, the acting in the piece should be rewarded handsomely, but in terms of the film/plot as a whole, I can't quite put this one into my upper echelon."

What does a viewer usually expect from a movie about a breakup? Well maybe a bunch of arguing? If you agree, then this will feel different. Because there's no arguing throughout the whole movie, except for this one scene, where everything begins civilized enough, and slowly turns into this very deep, dramatic, heartbreaking, emotional fight. That is the moment where Johansson and Driver get to shine, because when the scene happens, it will blow you away! Some of the reasons that it's so effective, is because of the acting, and because there's almost no other lashing out scenes. Acting is great from everyone here, all throughout. Plus the plot and the cinematography is great! I have one issue in particular, that bugged me when it happened. Somewhere past the halfway point, a lady comes in to Adam Driver's house. And the movie - at that point - is so slow and boring. This scene, I think lasted for 5-10 minutes. So, as much as I wanted to put this in my Top 5 ever, I couldn't. It was about 10 minutes too long. But other than that, this movie was intriguing from start to not great scene, then not great scene to finish."

But they are both vulnerable and by the end of the day want to do the right thing, and not only the thing that brings them satisfaction. It is not a fist fight but a storm of emotions, emerging waves of the past and rocky mountains of the future.
The acting is very very well executed, here and there a bit too many tears - but as it is about a divorce totally realistic. So is the representation of the ongoing divorce. The music is lovely, I especially loved the ending having musical elements.
There are quite a few inserts of funny elements that takes away from the movie's dramatic tone: like when Charlie cuts himself with that tiny knife, I actually laughed, or when Nora is talking about Jesus and his absent father.
We can all relate to these characters, and parenthood is represented so vividly.
On the technical side it was neatly executed, as well, editing etc.
I couldn't help but seeing a lot of Woody Allen in this movie, mostly because of its wittiness and pace, and the music.<br/><br/>Definitely a watch. I wish there would be more movies like this made out there...."

","I watched it before it was talked about for the Oscars and got into it immediately. One of the first monologues by Scarlett Johannson was so moving that I put Netflix on full screen It also left me very tired as it is breath taking.
I don´t believe I have ever seen Adam Driver in anything before but he is just as good. The characters don´t look pretty either physically or in their mentality, they are who they are, and spend 2 hours giving an idea of what it looks like to go through divorce.
It sometimes reminded me of ´Kramer vs Kramer´ for the topic except that it explores the emotions of both parties equally.
I am not sure I would recommend watching it in couple, or if you are looking for something ´fun´, although there are some humoristic moments.
Last words to Laura Dern and the other actors who are all excellent, but probably slightly shadowed by the 2 main actors who are really capturing the screen."

","And the Oscar goes to...
Pretty well everyone involved: leads Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, supporting actors Laura Dern and Alan Alda, director writer Noah Baumbach. Award spoilers aside, there's a damn startling movie here. Hollywood has tackled divorce often, and fumbled, until now. Eschewing the staid good guy vs. bad guy conflict, Baumbach zeroes in on a wonderful and lively young family, coming apart in a slow, spreading crack, that despite all good intentions, just keeps growing like a Roadrunner cartoon.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is an infuriatingly frustrating tale of characters who click as a couple, bubble with natural chemistry, yet can't quite transition past their early, blinding, love-in stage, when redefining transition is absolutely crucial. A universal conflict this. Driver and Johansson are exquisitely real in their roles, wrapping each other in delicious camaraderie, stepping out of comfort zones to seek solutions, snapping pettiness in conflict, crumbling at frustration. Can't help but cheer for their bliss, and tear up at their unravelling. Emotional roller coasters don't come much hairier.<br/><br/>Baumbach isn't afraid to poke, prod and twist deep into messy psyches on a journey revealing the complexities of human nature. Even in turmoil, amidst the vitriol, sometimes there is revelation. The lesson here: a lot of relationships unfurl because individuals crave their freedom, is a tough one because there isn't a magic solution, and sometimes happens. Also: lawyers are the worst.<br/><br/>A tough but worthwhile watch."

","A stage director and an actress fight for a difficult coast-to-coast divorce that brings them to their personal ends.<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot for this movie and was caught off guard when it launched on Netflix. It's very hard for me to be partial in a movie with Adam Driver but I'm doing my best.<br/><br/>I have to start by stressing here that this movie is certainly a movie I'd rather have seen in the movies and I'm not sure why. I saw Irishman at home and unlike this movie I was able to connect a lot more at home but this is probably a problem with me.<br/><br/>This movie is from Noah Baumbach who wrote with Wes Anderson, The Fantastic Mr. Fox, one of my favorite animations. Here he brings a very different movie and without being able to say even a little personal. Its direction is wonderful, with perfect sequential plans, especially with the character of Scarlett Johansson, and a very striking soundtrack. The color palette he used here is very beautiful, with more vivid colors when showing a family moment and more neutral colors when showing the couple fighting or moments of anger.<br/><br/>One of the problems I had with the movie was the lack of charisma of the characters but that is saved by the beautiful performances of the actors.

","Real and sad, Marriage Story will touch your heart and at times cause it to break completely. Moments of anger, sadness, hurt, sorrow and contempt give way to contentment, peace, comfort, and near joy. As we watch Charlie and Nicole fight to find who they are and what they want we discover that the best and worst parts of ourselves bring us together and separate us simultaneously. Ultimately, we work hardest for what we desire most, a place of realization that no one is perfect, not marriage, not divorce, and none of the days that follow either. However we do our best to make the best out of the situation we are in with hopes that we will do better for the next generation."
"kjproulx","10","4","6","9 December 2019"," One of the Best Dramas of the Decade
","I've been trying to come up with a way of reviewing this film in a way that doesn't seem like I personally directed it or something, because movies like Marriage Story don't come along very often and I just feel like gushing about how incredible is. Netflix has been releasing tons of quality content this year and this may very well be the best of their entire catalogue of feature films. Alone with Roma and their recent release of The Irishman, I believe you'll be seeing Marriage Story in contention for many, many awards in the coming months. Here's why I believe Marriage Story is a must-watch.<br/><br/>Not all relationships work out and if every single Romance film ever made had a happy ending, then that would just be a lie. It's nice to see a movie tackle this subject matter and stick with it from start to finish. Marriage Story is a look into the lives of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as they are clearly not able to keep a working marriage, but also don't want to ruin the family they have made. From gut-wrenching scenes of excessively honest dialogue and a conclusion that feels raw and true, this movie is one of the best dramas I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Take your pick at who outshines who here, because it really is a toss-up as to who is more incredible between Driver and Johansson. It does help that writer/director Noah Baumbach gave them outstandingly good dialogue to work with, but the way these two play off each other is as if they were given a year to prepare for these roles and get to know each other. Everything about this film felt authentic, which made the overall impact so powerful. It's not easy to watch a movie about a love story that's about how marriage sometimes doesn't work out, but this movie does it in such a way that it doesn't feel depressing throughout the majority of the duration. This is all thanks to Noah Baumbach though.<br/><br/>From Greenberg to While We're Young, Baumbach has been a director I've been keeping my eyes on, as I believe he has gotten better with each of his films, for the most part. It wasn't until The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) that I really started to anticipate his next movie, but now I'll be desperately awaiting to get another story from him. His talent as a director, especially on Marriage Story, is truly something else. He is best suited for movies like Marriage Story or While We're Young, where it's all about the characters because he very clearly has a knack at getting the best possible performances out of his cast.<br/><br/>Marriage Story begins strong, easing you into what will be a very emotional film and concludes in a way that feels natural. Overall, from these award-worthy performances, superb writing and directing, a very minimal score, which lets you sit with these characters for extended periods of time, it's very hard to nitpick this movie. There is one scene that made me chuckle, purely because I felt uncomfortable, but this movie is otherwise perfectly done. By the time 2019 ends, I feel that I may have to say this is the best movie of the year. I absolutely loved every minute of this movie. I can't recommend it enough."
"ihanriez","10","4","6","9 December 2019"," SPEECHLESS

Scarlett Johansson's expressions were on point, her face was filled with expression. Adam driver was a natural. Couldn't believe that he was that good.

"Nic_Dread_Wolf_Marling","10","4","6","8 December 2019"," A remarkable achievement!
","It's rare that a film's characters feel so lived in, so authentic, so possible. All their flaws are just that, flaws. We all have them, and most of us in excess. This is a fundamental truth which Marriage Story not only understands but embraces. It's refreshing to venture into a story about such a difficult issue that deals with characters who are likable and unlikable simultaneously. A story that places characters at it's center who are conflicted, yet good people at heart.<br/><br/>Nicole and Charlie hate each other. They also love each other. They get along in a manageable way, neither one wanting to overstep or make the other feel out of place. Their boundaries are clear yet flexible. These two know each other in the most intimate of ways, something that goes beyond love and romance. They know who the other really is, where their true self resides.<br/><br/>Nicole can order a meal or Charlie as if she's ordering for herself, her understanding of who is has become second nature. Charlie will drop what he's doing to fix Nicole's gate, which has been rendered inoperable during a blackout, because he knows it makes her uneasy, it's not even a question of whether he should or not-he knows it's needed. They can do these things for each other even despite being in the middle of a divorce settlement.<br/><br/>There's palpable animosity between them, but there is also a deep connection that has formed over a decade of spending their lives together that isn't easily erased. At times, most times, it seems as though neither of them wants this connection to fade, even if they both want their lives to be separate.<br/><br/>Nicole feels lost, alone, defeated. She doesn't think of herself as an individual any longer. She's become a nomad in her own head, wandering an unfamiliar landscape that should be intricate and weaved with emotional self awareness. Scarlett Johansson breezes through Marriage Story with a tender grace, a loving touch, the soothing nature of a mother, a woman who has the ability to nurture others yet has forgotten, not only who she is, but how to be a person unto herself.<br/><br/>There wasn't a single frame of this film where I felt I was watching Scarlett Johansson playing a character. I was certain I was witnessing some new undiscovered talent named Nicole catching her big break. Her words surge with feeling, her face bares the emotions nakedly and without concern for what others may think. She's captured the essence of a person so fully realized it's difficult to believe she's playing a role of fiction.<br/><br/>Charlie feels confused, distraught, guilty. He's captured by his own life and work to the point of not being able to see when others around him are drowning. He, too, has become a wander in a land that is alien, but one he also knows he's visited before. His and Nicole's lives are worked out, set to a schedule and standard he was comfortable with-one he hadn't considered to be prone to disarray. To him, their each good at different things and these opposite qualities balance not just their lives but their entire worlds.<br/><br/>He's a man uncomfortable with change, someone who had to struggle greatly to achieve the goals he set for himself. Adam Driver is raw and affecting every second he's on screen. When he hurts we feel his pain, when he cries that emotion wells within us the same. There is no doubt we're watching a documentary about this person's life coming undone.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach allows his lens to linger just as long as is needed to hit us with the punch he's aiming for. He moves in close when his performers are bearing their souls, keeping us near the action so we know it's real. He's talented enough to allow the range of his collaborators to reach their limits, and conscious enough to know when to pull back and move on. His instinctual ability to capture the essence of a character is the mark of an actor's director. His screenplay pops with energy when needed and allows us to feel a deep brooding undercurrent of a forthcoming boiling point.<br/><br/>He's not content to just make a film about two people falling away from each other. No, he's striving for something far more complex. He set his sights on telling a story where the characters don't have to be loved or hated for their points of view to make sense or be felt, and yet he still manages to make us feel both of those emotions throughout the film.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is crafted with the utmost care. The technique of it's creator is working at the highest level of this craft. Baumbach's performers grab us by the face, staring intently into our eyes, and scream at us that this is a story worth telling, worth experiencing, and it's alright to swept up in it. This isn't an easy topic to discuss. Divorces often become messy and those involved lose sight of the fact that the person opposite them was someone they had a real closeness to at one time. Handling a film like this in such a fresh way would be a challenge for anyone to direct, write, or perform, and lucky for us this one was taken on by three supremely capable talents."

"Alexander_Blanchett","10","4","6","7 December 2019"," Wow
","This was a Slam Dunk. I had high anticipations for this film but never in my wildest dreams would have expected it to be THAT good. I was sitting through out the film and kept saying to myself during many, many scenes again and again: ""Wow, this is amazing"". I hardly ever experience some reaction as strong as this. It is a true masterpiece. A Modern Kramer Vs Kramer however from a different approach. Noah Baumbach made his masterpiece. The film he will be most remembered for. I always liked him as a filmmaker but also felt he is sometimes receptive, not this time, this time he created something on its very own.
The acting is superb to say the least. I always though Scarlett Johansson is an underrated actress, but not even I had the slightest idea that she has ""This"" inside her. What a ride. What a performance. This will be hard to be beaten this year when it comes to actresses. Or actors for that matter. She really showed all of us what an actress she is. And the perfect Middle Finger to everyone who only see her as ""Black Widow"".
Adam Driver was not far away from the level of quality. In fact he really gave his character so many interesting and different facettes that you felt it was a real person. Both Driver and Johansson achieved that and brought a lot of character development into the mix.
Laura Dern was also great. You never knew if you should like her or hate her (I guess that depends if you are Team Nicole or Team Charlie). A fantastic turn for Dern who was often ignored to play ""Rich "" like this because she is fabulous in those roles (also see Big Little Lies for ex). Ray Liotta was the strongest in male support. A hilarious but also very controls and strict performance. Not to under appreciate Alan Alda who did very well, too. But Liotta outshone him.
All in all a fantastic piece of character cinema that will play with your emotions. It starts right away with the opening montage and ends with ... well you will see. And should see."

","Marriage Story is the most heartbreaking film I may have ever seen, Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their careers which is saying a lot for these two as they are both phenomenal actors. Noah Baumbachs direction is also fantastic, the choice of using 35mm made it feel like old family photos that you look through as you get older. But the exploration of the divorce, how both parties behave and react to all the legal proceedings take place were really interesting and thought provoking. Baumbach's screenplay is also fantastic, the arguments in this film felt authentic and real, and was extremely confronting to watch at times. There is one scene in particular which I truly believe is the best scene i have experienced in the past 5 years. I loved this film and found it emotionally gripping and feels like a piece of work so personal that I felt that only Baumbach could pull off this film the way he did.<br/><br/>The only nitpicky thing I have with this film is in the beginning some of the scenes are a little on the long side and draw out for too long, however I think this was due to the fact that I hadn't connected with the characters yet and wasn't as immersed as I was until the film started building momentum, however when it does get the momentum the nitpicks I had at the start weren't even worth worrying about.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is one of the best films this year showcasing absolutely world class acting, directing and writing. I went through a whole range of emotions when watching this and I loved it. This film is a true masterpiece."
"Benslie","10","13","29","6 December 2019"," One of the best movies of the year
","First of all, I just need to talk about the amazing performances both of the leads give us. Both Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give it their all in this movie and give out probably some of their best performances to date and they deserve nominations in the upcoming award season. They never feel like people playing these characters but actual people that you wanted to support. Their performances keep you invested from beginning to end. It wasn't just them that was great but the supporting cast was brilliant as well. Noah Baumbach did an incredible job with this movie not just as the director but also the writer. Just like how all of the actors made us feel like they were real people the way it's directed and written makes us feel like a fly on the wall during this. I personally have never witnessed people getting a divorce but this movie gave me insight into what goes down and this film isn't afraid to show the realism of what happens. I personally feel like there was only one thing they could have done to make this more accurate to what happens during a divorce but overall it seemed accurate to what goes down. Really my only problem with the movie is that I feel like there were some scenes missing that I wish were included. Sure, the movie is already two-hours and sixteen-minutes long but I feel like there were some scenes that we needed to see. There's one moment in particular that I wish we got to see what exactly happened because it comes out of left field and I wish we got to see it instead of just hearing it. In the end, Marriage Story is an amazing movie that is streaming now on Netflix and everybody should check it."
"gortx","Null","21","52","9 November 2019"," Very well performed, but the characters are ill-defined
","It's no secret that behind the benign title, Noah Baumbach's newest is really a 'Divorce Story' (I suppose it makes it more marketable and palatable on a marquee). After a somewhat rosy prologue we truly meet our New York City couple: Nicole (Scarlet Johannson), a 30 something Actress who started out in Hollywood. Charlie (Adam Driver), a 30 something theater Director who uses Nicole as his muse. They are in a therapy session trying to avert a Divorce, but, it's clear from the outset that it's inevitable.<br/><br/>From that start point, the film (shot on 35mm) progresses on pretty much a steady plain - Arguments. Accusations. The woman moving out (back to L.A.). The hiring of Divorce attorneys. The attorneys argue. Etc. etc. Also, another predictable element: The cute kid (Henry played by Azhy Robertson) caught in the tug of war in between. Is ""Henry"" a nod to KRAMER VS. KRAMER's Justin Henry? (there's also a not so subtle nod to Ingmar Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE tucked in)
What keeps the film flowing is the fine performances of Johannson and Driver. I've usually found Driver to be too diffident to be really effective, but, here, he delivers his strongest acting yet. Johansson has always been appealing, and is more than fine here. The Supporting cast is also fine including Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as the trio of lawyers involved in the case, Merrit Wever as Nicole's sister, and a pleasant surprise in seeing Julie Hagerty as her mom (didn't even recognize her as it's been years since I've seen her in anything even if she has been semi-active).<br/><br/>Still, as effective as the ensemble is, and as punchy a script as Baumbach has written can be at times, the film's arc comes off as a bit flat. Other than flashbacks, we never get to really see the true dynamics of the marriage. The pair too often come off as self-absorbed narcissists (not uncommon in Baumbach's writing). They say they are mismatched, but are they really? It wouldn't be a stretch to think that some viewers will say that they 'deserve each other'. The principle argument seems to be over whether they should base in L.A. or New York, rather than something catastrophically wrong in their relationship.<br/><br/>Now, it's also no secret that Baumbach has based his screenplay partly on his own divorce from Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. That very public split also involved Baumbach's affair (and now full relationship) with actress Greta Gerwig (there's even a nod to her Directing nomination). But, MARRIAGE STORY softens that critical detail, and that's unfortunate. Not because a filmmaker should air their dirty laundry on screen*, but, because with that crucial event (or something akin), the story seems not only incomplete but it also makes the couple seem even more selfish. To substitute, Baumbach has included a knock down drag out argument between the pair where they vent and vent and vent. Like much of the movie, it's well acted, but, still has a certain hollowness at its core.<br/><br/>MARRIAGE STORY is a rare adult film in a sea of lite entertainment. The acting is extremely good, and worth seeing for it. But, they are let down by the less than candid characters.<br/><br/>* See Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES for a more honest take"
"andallthatbroadway","7","6","11","25 December 2019"," GREAT ACTING. Not that great scenario.
","Good movie. Almost very good.
I watched the movie with big expectations, because everyone tells you that the story is so good that you'll cry through it. But no. Because there are major gaps in the story (not the time jumps) that makes you go ""what happened now?"", some meaningless conversations that seem far-fetched (like that thing with the pie) and some weak points that break the spell. I especially couldn't stand the character of Scarlet Johansson. What was she trying to do throughout the movie? She was presented as that strong character that is very kind, patient and reasonable but she kept acting like the weakest person on earth that depends on other people's decisions. Maybe that's what the movie is trying to say, that the process of divorcing is so frustrating that it makes people make bad decisions and even entirely changes them. I don't know. But I don't think that's it.<br/><br/>Great acting though. Great performances from both Scarlet and Adam. I would be happy to see Adam Driver winning an Oscar for this role. I think that was an oppurtunity to prove himself as a ""good actor"" and he took it. His acting is very natural from the start to the end. I REALLY REALLY loved it."

","A beautiful but so sad movie. It's litterally impossible not to tear up! And Adam Driver omg what a talent he is! Only gets better and better. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as well. Long time since I saw a movie gripping as this, must been the 1979 Kramer vs Kramer last time."
"maroinjoundi","10","6","11","7 December 2019"," Real, true, where emotions find their way up in dialogues and feel palpable.
","It's not about realistic things, but more about realism. All right, all right, let me explain.<br/><br/>Marriage story simply deals with the split of this couple that had very happy years, but now they don't feel as connected as before. The thing with Noah Baumbach is he really likes to tell human stories, stories about an everyday problem that is not necessarily dealt with realistic encounters and dialogues(in a way they perfectly do, but they also thrive from being on a screen and develop their own world), but the general realism of a story like this gets translated through the script and camera. Does that make sense? Does it have a ground? Seriously, i'm sincere right now, i just lack the words, but i hope you get me.<br/><br/>Anyway, this realism really connects with the watchers, you kind of feel inside the story, it' a ""well, that could've happened or could happen to me"". Of course you draw your mentality from there and you feel you could handled that situation better than the characters, but it's not about that, you don't know it because the emotions of this characters are real, palpable, almost like if events and reactions like that really happened and were simply recorded like a documentary, but highlighted. We're very very different, we don't all express our feelings the same way, that's why it differs from each individual. What i'm trying to say is that it's a relatable story, but still made for entertainment and i love that.<br/><br/>Going more technical, Driver and Johansson are MAGNIFICENT, at the prime of their talent. Writing, direction and production overall, it's all up there and if i didn't make myself clear, it's a top notch work, the really embodied the spirit of this story. Oscar worthy? Hell yes, everything about this movie is good, i honestly can't see anything wrong with it, at first i was afraid of some forced dramatic acting, but, well maybe there is, but it definitely doesn't take anything out of the story and overall quality.<br/><br/>In so many categories this movie excels, can't just pick one. Also, i've just realised now it was over 2 hours, they flew away."
"carlitos-01390","10","6","11","7 December 2019"," One of the most beautiful and sad movies of 2019
","This film for me is one of the best movies of 2019, because it portrays a subject that many people have gone through, divorce.<br/><br/>So the movie presents two people, Nicole ( Scarlett Johansson ) and Charlie ( Adam driver), a married couple that is having rough times and are getting a divorce but this make difficult because they have a child. So we already have seen movies with this subject matter that is divorce; but this movie portrays this subject so down to earth, and I don't mean to say that a divorce is an easy process to pass, it is not, it is difficult, painful, sad and can show the worst part of a person, and this movie is exactly like that, we see the character at there best moments but then we see them in there worse. This film works because of the great directing, realistic performances, scarlet just showed some of her most powerful acting that I could feel her feelings.<br/><br/>In conclusion , this movie is beautiful, sad, funny and dramatic, all these elements makes this movie one of the best of the year and we're closing this decade with a beautiful masterpiece."
"rafaelfiel","8","8","16","10 December 2019"," The new ""Kramer vs Kramer""
","This movies from Noah Baumbach, that is overrated for me, is a masterful. However. it seems an actual Kramer vs Kramer. Something not so original but very well done. Scarlet and Adam have the best palying of their careers, but They´re not lucky in a year with Joaquin Phoenix and Reneé´Zellweger I think that they will wIn some awards in the future for other less significant job.
For everyone, enjoy this movie that shows what happens in a lot of marriages where competition is the basis after the first phase of love."
"PaxtonMalloy","8","8","16","7 December 2019"," Neither a masterpiece nor a failure
","I was looking forward to this movie. Two very good actors in what seems to be the perfect stage to show what they are able to do, a movie about divorce and family which instantly reminds you of Kramer vs. Kramer.<br/><br/>For a long time this movie is very dry but I think this intended as part of the evolution of the story. Both parents in the beginning try to handle the divorce as if it is not a big thing and thus even though it is a drama it lacks exactly that, the drama.
But while building to the climax there all these little details that will get call backs later and you get to the insanity of the legal procedure that comes with divorce. Even though I never got divorced it feels like this is very accurate description. At the end it comes full circle and gets more emotional and dramatic and this where the movie finally got me.<br/><br/>So I don't think this is anything like masterpiece. It is a good movie with two outstanding performances even though I feel like Driver stands out a little more. I'll get why it builds to a climax and thus before that keeps more calm but this made me feel less interested and I believe that getting a divorce with a kid and custody claims will be nothing but emotional from beginning to the end and Marriage Story really becomes gripping in the last third of the movie."

It's not your typical Hollywood blockbuster, but an a authentic piece of cinema, with an amazing script and suberb acting performances of Driver and Johansson.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone that's ever been in love, as it's not necessarily about divorce, but more about the struggle in love to give each other the happiness that your partner deserves. Sometimes it's better to go different paths, even though the romance isn't completely dead. I think this movie portrays this beautifully. Oscar contender without a doubt!"

","Seen at the Viennale 2019: Definitely, I should have fallen for this one. I love the acting of Johannssen and of Driver in all their previous movies. I was aware that it might be easier for Driver to play a character role (and I was right). But Johannssen did not fall short behind to hit the right keys in her emotional outbursts. Sadly, the script did not work out to create an convincing setting for the story about the divorcing of a grownup couple. I did not understand, why the lawyers got such an important part in the story. The static camera work did not help either, and so did not the clean stage setting. Also the television aspect ratio of 16:9 freezes the acting in a narrow space too small for the big screen. Maybe this movie works out in a better way as Netflix stream on Iphones. On the big screen it was disturbingly unsatisfying and a waste of the talents of the great actors Johannssen and Driver."

"MouazHajBakri","9","7","14","7 December 2019"," A true picture portrayed by masterful screenplay, direction, and unforgettable performances
","I read once that to write a character in a screenplay you should prepare as much as possible about this character's aspects starting from their childhood, their school and what it has been like, their parents and how they were raised, their neighborhood and how was life in it, their friends and old toys, their first kiss and love story, their ambitions and passions and how they came to be. These can easily fill 20 pages of details that are not represented directly into the screenplay but they shape the truthfulness of the character, the details that make them alive and dynamic.<br/><br/>In Marriage Story, i cant imagine nothing short of a book worth of details that humanized every little moment in this picture. Its truly dazzling the amount of work that went through this mesmerizing screenplay. Each word, statement, monologue, dialogue, decision, facial feature, had been studied extremely thoroughly resulting into a novel of dynamics. It feels very palpable and relatable up to a point of making it into a very personal level of even people who didn't go through a separation with this level of complexity.<br/><br/>This articulate writing style had translated into elevating the performances into the level of true, its not acting, its simply true on every level. And to solidify this excellence, Noah Baumbach (director and writer) has passionately constructed each scene with the utmost of care; each frame is perfectly designed in angles, colors, dimensions, and production design to amplify the emotional rollercoasters of the story. And lastly, the editing style specifically the choice of when to break a scene and when to prolong it and make more focused, are just in the level of master class.<br/><br/>Marriage story is many things, its an important human story, a screenplay to remember and dissect and study to all those who are interested in any form of writing, and simply a movie that would easily grab your attention from its very first minute into the level of you welcoming its soul punching arc, because it is very real, something that is in somewhat of a shortage in our lives nowadays."

Amazing writing, every scene served a purpose. There was a good balance of scenes that give you a laugh ( I loved the scenes with Nicole's sister and mother) and scenes with emotions that hit you like a train. Performance wise, everyone is fantastic, everyone feels very natural, and Scarlett and Adam knock it out of the park. Another thing I loved is that this film felt very real, and that's how it should be, dealing with a very real experience.

","Charlie (Adam Driver) & Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are a married couple who have finally given up on each other and agree to get a divorce. No matter what they do to correct the once happy marriage (including counselling) the end results remain the same. Marriage Story allows us to witness the lifestyle and personal challenges that come to both Charlie and Nicole as they question the future for themselves and their only son. Things become even more tense and dramatic when both partners seek out lawyers in the pursuit of custody of their son.<br/><br/>When I first heard that actors Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were playing a married couple on screen I couldn't imagine how that would work. But as I began watching the film, I couldn't get over how convincing the two are as a married couple. The two show great chemistry which thankfully is kept consistent throughout the entire film. Even when the two are arguing or disagreeing, you can actually feel that the two people are connected and were once married. Marriage Story easily has some of the greatest performances of 2019 and not just from the leads. It also provided a top notch supporting cast who were surprisingly entertaining whenever they appeared. Some of the supporting cast actors included Laura Dern, Ray Liotta & Alan Alda who all played lawyers throughout the film. Each actor, just like the leads, was solid and extremely convincing in all areas.<br/><br/>Another key strength is the dialogue and script. It's quick, snappy and on top of that, it just feels so real. Considering this is classed as a drama I never found myself bored during the story. The way the actor's delivered scripted lines sometimes even comes across as fun amidst the dramatic moments. It's quite surprising the way this film juggles between the positive moments as well as the sad ones as we watch everything going on with Charlie and Nicole.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is well directed and has a good audio track as well as visuals. At no point did the shots disappoint me or feel out of place. Everything here is enjoyable and comfortable to view for the whole duration. The film has done a great job at providing small transitions between selected scenes which can make it feel like a stage play. Another fun effect is the use of jazz tunes to uplift the tone of the film after a tense moment.<br/><br/>In a nutshell Marriage Story is surprisingly enjoyable considering the film's themes and topic. Even if you think this type of film isn't relatable to you, I still highly recommend it. The film's performances are absolutely surprising and had I seen this in a cinema, I would have stood up and applauded it.<br/><br/>9.6/10

"dom-lerose-8","Null","5","9","9 December 2019"," Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deliver two of 2019's most mesmerizing performances
","Take a look at any film critic's Top 10 List of 2019 and you will certainly find Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" at the top. A guaranteed nominee for Best Picture at the upcoming Academy Awards and a likely contender to win, this is a film I wanted to adore and rave about to everyone, yet sadly the film falls short of glory to be fully deserving.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story,"" tells the break-up story of Nicole and Charlie, a married couple living in New York City who battle for custody of their son Henry in the process of a bitter divorce. Nicole is an actress who moves to Los Angeles after leading a role in a television series, where Charlie struggles to stay on his feet after moving to L.A. from New York during the legal process to stay connected with his son.<br/><br/>What's interesting about this film is that both characters are very unlikeable and clearly selfish and bad romantic partners. Charlie's career ambition as a New York play director drives him more than his marriage, while Nicole's own selfishness and insecurity make her just as inadequate of a spouse. We never feel attached to one lead character over the other, which allows us as an audience to observe their marriage objectively and neutrally. There's never a ""good guy"" in the pair, which serves as a challenge for the audience in gravitating to one or the other out of the two.<br/><br/>While having selfish protagonists can make the viewing experience more enjoyable in certain films, in a story that is reliant on heavy emotions it's important to have characters we genuinely admire in order to experience an emotional investment. It's hard not to empathize with Charlie and Nicole in their toxic divorce, yet I wish they were more likable to enhance the emotional struggles this couple goes through to the viewer. Baumbach gives each character more attention and attributes than most filmmakers bother, yet we aren't able to like them simply because of how selfish they are as people and spouses.<br/><br/>Baumbach crafts a strong script that finds room for charm even in depressing situations and allows us to learn about the personalities and motivations of Charlie and Nicole, yet he fails to make us root for them as a couple. The entire film we're aware that they should divorce and we immediately get the impression that they are not meant for each other. The only timer we ever really feel as if the divorce is an unfortunate event is towards the end when we get a well-executed full circle to the opening.<br/><br/>Having a couple that we care about and want to see happy together would have been a far more effective narrative due to generating a stronger connection with the audience. The writer/director also centers his film more on the individual personal journeys of Charlie and Nicole and not their relationship. Not enough screen time captures the two together in a way that we can experience any unique features that make this couple unique nor do we see enough of their backstory together that allows us to see what the couple was like before they started the divorce process.<br/><br/>The remarkable performances by Johansson and Driver are what make ""Marriage Story"" a film worth celebrating. Actors belonging to two of the biggest blockbuster franchises in entertainment history (""The Avengers,"" ""Star Wars"") who are still capable of portraying real-life people in films that rely solely on story and not spectacle is a testament to the talents of these two actors. While not portraying likable characters, each actor exemplifies the brutal stress and sorrow of divorce and how it breaks down the soul.<br/><br/>The two leads memorize lengthy scenes of dialogue and hit every note pitch-perfectly. One extended sequence in particular in which the couple has a loud, fiery argument is acting at its purest and finest, both actors' emotions so real and accurate it becomes infectious to watch. Johnasson and Driver make every second of the film worthwhile due to the sheer talent they possess in bringing these characters and their struggles to life.<br/><br/>Laura Dern does great work as Nicole's tough-as-nails, passive-aggressive attorney, her character similar to her iconic Renada Klein in ""Big Little Lies."" Dern provides some comedic relief as well, her strong personality always present in every scene. Veteran actors Ray Liotta and Alan Alda also soar as Charlie's different attorneys, each embodying their characters in a spot-on manner.<br/><br/>This is very much an actor's movie, similar to ""Kramer v. Kramer"" and ""Revolutionary Road."" The film struggles to find its own voice and is clearly inspired by several other films. This is more of a divorce story than a marriage story, for we never really get to see the actual marriage at hand. We get the impression early on from its poignant opening montage in which both Charlie and Nicole narrate what they love about each other that we'll get to see the past and present of a beautiful marriage slowly fall apart, yet instead the film focuses solely on their divorce.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is one of 2019's most acclaimed films. While you won't find better performances in almost any other film this year, it still struggles to deliver the emotional punch and kick necessary to touch something new. Noah Baumbach is clearly a gifted filmmaker who captures the nuances in human interactions and details each scene and his effort is present in every scene. He just gets lost along the way in finding the proper story to tell."

","So, Baumbach, huh? Ah, I see, that;s Adam Driver! Did Scarlett really just make me wipe a tear off my cheek?<br/><br/>Absolute revelation for me. I finally got why Baumbach is held in such high esteem. I enjoyed Squid, Frances, and Greenberg, found Meyerowitz watchable. Far preferred what he wrote for Anderson (Zissou and the exceptional (and also fantastic) Mr Fox). Marriage Story though towers above those. The writing is so nuanced, what happens offscreen so evident and understandable to all, The dialogue is powerful, tender, bitter, and yet also reserved - there are times when you want to scream at the characters to just say the things that in all our lives that go unsaid. But mostly it's how the screenplay paces and drives a movie that is almost entirely about the words spoken - it would work well on stage and even radio - which builds to a satisfying and appropriate end to the movie. (Desperately avoiding any emotionally descriptive words so as not to spoil the end.)<br/><br/>Never been a fan of Driver. Girls is mostly what I've seen him in, felt his wildly unstable character was hard to consider well acted. Seen a number of movies he's featured in too, none were memorable performances. In MS though, he delivers a tour de force. A character so well rounded and identifiable that - despite revelations that should make us dislike the character - we empathise and sympathise with, and positively root for him. Oscar material for me.<br/><br/>And Johansson. I knew she could act. Had seen it in Pearl Earring, Translation, remembered elements from Vicky Christina, but this is the first time in a good many years that a movie depended so much upon her being able to deliver a genuinely believable character. She does it with aplomb! It's the juxtaposition of our support and feelings for her character balanced in equal measure with Driver's that is at the root of the success of MS. Scarlett is superb.<br/><br/>This is on a par with Kramer vs Kramer. Actors and writer/director deserve that level of recognition for a stunningly good movie."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","9","20","25 November 2019"," An impressive, realistic, and emotional awards contender
","This has been an incredibly good year for movies, and the fact that I can say that when there's still so many more to see is more impressive still. Add Marriage Story to the list of potential 2019 classics too- it's easily Noah Baumbach's best film yet, and features what could be career best performances from both Scarlett Johansson and the always captivating Adam Driver.<br/><br/>The screenplay is all but a shoe-in for an Academy Award, due to the brilliant manner in which it delivers emotional gut-punch after emotional gut-punch without feeling overly sentimental or sappy; it's an absolute tearjerker for sure, but it never feels cheap, and it never feels manipulative. Usually films that feel so grounded in reality leave me cold (looking at you Michel Haneke and Ingmar Bergman), but this one strikes a balance that I've hardly ever seen before. It's the best of both worlds, really.<br/><br/>Also admirable is how great the entire supporting cast is (including the child actor), and how everyone feels like a real person. Both leads have admirable qualities and qualities that make them flawed and incredibly human. It's tough at times to see these two flawed yet sympathetic people pitted against each other; it would be an easier sit if one was villainised but this really isn't the case, and the film is all the more strong because of it (though it does lead to some intentionally uncomfortable and very tense scenes that still prove hard to look away from).<br/><br/>I was sceptical about Netflix's potential to make the sort of big, awards-worthy movies that typically top best of the year lists, but between this and Scorsese's latest, I have to say they're doing some impressive stuff. You won't lose too much from watching this at home over in a cinema, in fact it might be easier- after all, crying in public isn't always ideal, and chances are you will tear up more than once in this film's final act.<br/><br/>But importantly, as mentioned before: those tears are earned, thanks to the incredible characterisation, dialogues, and performances. This one's unmissable, and really, if it's going to be on Netflix within the next few weeks, you have no excuse, really."

I realized this when I found myself unable to look away. I just was locked in completely. Scarlett was great!!! Laura Dern, Alan Alda, Merrit Wever all stellar. He will win all of the awards, deservedly so!"

The ending got me pretty surprised, I think it could be better, but that didn't overshadowed the love and passion that they (the director, the actors and the whole team) putted on this piece of art. This is my opinion, it may not be your cup of tea but I'd say watch it, give it a try."
"bastille-852-731547","8","6","12","6 December 2019"," Powerful, wrenching portrait of a divorce
","While the title of ""Marriage Story"" may give off the impression of a romantic comedy, this soulful but often very bleak divorce drama certainly isn't that. However, it's an extremely well-made film that absolutely demands to be seen and fully paid attention to. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach, the film tells the story of a theatre director in New York City who is on the verge of making it to Broadway, and his wife, an actress who moves to Los Angeles after finding employment there. As the two main characters, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson both do an outstanding job of portraying a near-perfect blend of strong emotions and down-to-earth, humanistic realism in their performances. Baumbach's script is witty and powerful, complemented by a subtle yet ultimately impactful and enthralling score.<br/><br/>Another highlight in the film is Laura Dern's exceptional performance as the divorce attorney for Johansson's character. She manages to come across as both empathetic yet deeply pragmatic and convincing, and her character is thoughtfully developed. I've always really liked Dern as an actress, but her supporting performance here is truly exceptional and will hopefully be rewarded come awards season. The film's emotional power is also commendable, as it simple yet potent nature hits the viewer like a gut punch. We actually truly feel for all of the characters involved, both the main couple as well as the supporting characters. The film is also improved by Baumbach humanizing both of the two main characters. We are able to see both of these two individuals as not only spouses, but flawed yet sometimes well-meaning individuals going through extremely difficult times personally. While it's slightly long and has a few somewhat clichÃ© moments, this is otherwise an extremely well-made film from Baumbach that will be remembered long after the credits roll. 8.5/10"

"warthogjump","10","4","7","2 January 2020"," Flawless depiction of family violence
","This is most definitely movie of the year!!
The acting from Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson is impeccable. As much as I love Scarlet as a versatile actor, I could not help but despise her character. Woman who has it all - a husband who cooks, cleans, is a wonderful father and is able to provide for the family financially. Most importantly, a husband who shows restraint at his wife's wild behaviour and not for one moment falls to her level. And yet, she tears him apart financially, physically and emotionally all in the name of self entitlement.<br/><br/>Lawyers are the only winners in this movie, but yet it shows why amicable separation is absolutely essential for a peaceful breakup with flawless direction, amazing script and phenomenal acting performances throughout.<br/><br/>Relocation of children is one of the most difficult personal and legal battles the left behind parent can face, and Nicole in this movie made it an impossible task for Charlie to be a father without turning his life upside down. Why? For control. Charlie foresaw it all, but it was inevitable because of Nicole's behaviour, or to give her the benefit of the doubt, ignorance.<br/><br/>The best aspects about this movie is that it keeps the viewer engaged all throughout, the acting is utterly superb, and it keeps you hoping for a happy ending to Charlie's extreme struggles as a father, but as the movie ends we learn that Charlie is yet again a victim of Nicole's controlling behaviour but he is willing to compromise for the happiness of the child. It is an absolute emotional rollercoaster. It is a devastating watch for a father, mainly because it is such a real and raw depiction of marriage, separation, divorce and the business of lawyers and courts.<br/><br/>It is without question a 10/10 for its flawless direction, acting and ability to keep attention thanks for a script which brings meaning to every word spoken. I would be very surprised if this doesn't take home at least some Oscars, but most of all I think Adam Driver's transformation from happy to sad, from calm to stressed, is an unfortunate joy to watch on screen."

","Marriage Story Review:<br/><br/>Marriage Story is written and directed by Noah Baumbach and stars Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as a couple going through a divorce. This divorce pushes them to their limits and changes them, but while this is affecting them they're also trying to provide a happy environment for their son. In about August, this became my most anticipated film of the year. I just love Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver proved to be great with his Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman. Also I discovered Noah Baumbach last year with his film While We're Young which I think is very underrated. He's had a few Oscar nominations and is just a great screenwriter and director. Before Marriage Story my favorite of his was the slice of life Frances Ha. This film affected me on so many levels emotionally. I don't know how one could possibly watch this without shedding at least one tear. It's so incredibly real and it's just amazing how it all played out. Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again. I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better.

Scarlett Johansson has her best performance once again. I feel like every time she's in a film she just gets better and better. The hardest part about this film is that it shows both sides and you can switch back and forth between who you like more and who you like less. But also you don't want them to split up. Noah Baumbach did great with this because it's a frustrating film. It engages you into the characters and story so much that you start to feel so much anger and frustration and happiness and comedy. The tone has literally everything and blends it great. Back to the comedy, this film has some pretty funny moments that helped with the depressing tone. Marriage Story just made me depressed, especially the very end, and it still lingered after I watched it. The very end just crushed me but it was also the best scene in the whole film. Just everything blends so nicely in this. Randy Newman's score is one of my favorites of the year. It's so joyful and sad at the same time. Listening to it before seeing the film I was confused how it would work with the story, because there are times where it sounded just so animated. It just worked perfectly. I also liked the aspect ratio choice of 1.66:1 because it felt more like a home movie. To me 1.33:1 and 1.66:1 work nice for a home movie feel. Everything was just so realistic in this and I didn't want it to end. This has become my fourth favorite film of the year so far. Also it's one of those films where I don't want to rewatch it too much so it surprises me every time with how great it is. I do that with my favorite films. Marriage Story is a film that should be recognized as one of the best of the decade. It demonstrates peak storytelling, superb acting, and shows that Noah Baumbach is one of the best directors out there. I really think it would be cool if it won best picture, screenplay, and acting. There are so many words I have for this and I want to talk about it for a while. I think I'll leave it like this so you can experience it for yourself. Marriage Story is another perfect movie of the year.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"Abranth-d","10","4","7","14 December 2019"," When reality hits ...
","Here's my review of ' Marriage story ' . So marriage story is directed by Noah baumbach known for his intense family dramas and frequent writing collaborations with Wes Anderson himself. The movie stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson and it's about this couple going through a divorce . That's just about it. Sounds like a simple indie movie with a lot of crying and Keith urban in the background right ? Nope. This movie is very human and tries to tell a story which hits you with reality on every level , and the last time a movie did that was ' the pursuit of happiness ' . All the actors in this movie were great ! And added so much depth to the characters they played. Now the audience are like little kids not knowing whose side to take during the divorce cause both of them have strong points on their side that you don't know who to root for. The courtroom scenes and the lawyer's entry into this mutual consent makes it very intense at times. I should have said this earlier but Adam driver and Scarlett Johannson were amazing in this movie to the point that you don't know whether they're acting or not and I'm not even exaggerating . The dialogue feels very real and so does the overall environment . It's also masterfully shot and beautifully scored and it's one of the best movies I've seen this year which isn't part of a franchise or an adaptation of a comic book or video game. In the end 'Marriage story' Is a hard hitting tale with powerful acting , life like dialogue , an engaging narrative and proof that when reality hits , it hits hard."
"anthonyjlangford","9","4","7","12 December 2019"," Honesty, at last.
","Heartbreaking performances that both deserve Oscars are not the most incredible aspect of this film.
It's honesty is, and realism and not taking sides in the war of the sexes, which is sadly all too prevalent today in the subdivisional world the internet has generated. Presenting the complex issues of modern day relationships and breakdowns and legal ramifications is so refreshing. Having lived through this situation twice, once as a stepparent and then a parent, this story was so distressing to sit through. It's the age related dilemma of our sad times.<br/><br/>The absent father is a 30 to 40 year old myth, as is the notion that women are held to a higher account. If anything, today one of the sexes are able to get away with literally anything and any differantation being brought into question is seen as sexism. At least in the media and popular entertainment world. The law sees it differently.
Child neglect and abuse is committed by both parents equally which can be verified in the data, depending where you look. Even then its pretty close to equal. Not what the haters want you to believe.<br/><br/>The real perpetrators here is the system, which seeks a win for clients over the needs of children and emotional and financial wellbeing of parents. It's responsible for literally driving people past the edge. Choose any Western nation and you will find pretty much the same story. Divisiveness kills. Children are all too often put second, but as is depicted very intelligently by its writer, sometimes there is no clear solution.<br/><br/>To have this film released in 2019 is astounding and couldn't be more needed. This is the messy reality of life. Not the Shangri La fantasy that self interested groups aspire to create. More understanding and unity and less demonization. We must learn to give a little, if not a lot, and learn to get along. This is the most important film for many years.

"evanston_dad","10","5","10","17 December 2019"," Career Best
","Writer/director Noah Baumbach delivers a career best in this funny, sad, infuriating, heartbreaking story about the dissolution of a marriage. Adam Driver is proving himself to be one of the best actors of his generation, and I've long thought that Scarlett Johansson was underappreciated. Both get a chance to shine in this film, along with supporting players Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta, all three playing divorce attorneys of varying stripes. The film is about how the machine of divorce tramples over those who have the best intentions, and about the near impossibility of remaining civil when the system benefits from people acting like savages.<br/><br/>I wasn't prepared for the film to be as funny as it is at times, which makes its poignant moments all the more affecting by comparison. The script is full of memorable set pieces, all of them brilliantly acted. Such as the miserably depressing one that finds Driver's dad determined to take his son trick-or-treating in L.A. Or a jaw dropping argument between Driver and Johansson that ends in both saying the kinds of things that would alter a relationship forever. Or the incredibly cringey scene where a case worker visits Driver's apartment to observe his parenting skills and ends with him blood soaked and fainting on the kitchen floor. Or the moment toward the end when Driver breaks into an impromptu performance of the song ""Being Alive"" at a New York bar, and which confirmed my belief that there's a Stephen Sondheim song for literally every life event that perfectly articulates what it's like to go through it.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is easily one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are married with a young son. They're working on their divorce. She's an L.A. girl with a popular teen movie when she followed him to NYC. He becomes a well regarded theater director and she's his leading lady. She wants to return to L.A. to start a new TV show while he's bringing his show to Broadway. She hires divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern).<br/><br/>There have been many divorce movies over the years. This is one of the better ones. It has a great opening which probably gaslighted me to this marriage. I kept hoping for reconciliation or at least, an easy peace. This gets to some dark places and it climaxes to a powerful scene in the motel room. The movie needs to wrap up a little quicker after that climatic fight. I would like some parts to go a different way but at the end of the day, this is Noah Baumbach's story. He probably drew some inspiration from his real life and who am I to judge. There are good laughs and there are devastating moments. It is a highlight of an interesting career."

If you can't look beyond the veneer of the ""class"" presented, please, find a friend and talk to them.<br/><br/>In short, a love letter to those in Hollywood's system on how to find a handle on sanity and respecting human beings during some of our worst moments.

"ferguson-6","9","10","25","6 December 2019"," masterful story telling and acting
","Greetings again from the darkness. Nicole has already made her decision. The film opens with her and husband Charlie in a therapy session. They are listing traits they admire about the other person. Watching this, we are unsure if the therapist thinks this exercise might salvage a broken marriage, or if it's some cruel way of highlighting what is being lost. This is writer-director Noah Baumbach's most gut-wrenching film to date, and it's based, at least partially, on his split from wife Jennifer Jason Leigh. Writing about personal experience is nothing new for Baumbach, as THE SQUID AND THE WHALE was inspired by his parents' divorce.<br/><br/>Charlie (Adam Driver) is an up-and-coming theatre director in New York City, and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is the company's lead actor. When Nicole informs Charlie that she wants a divorce, and is headed back home to Los Angeles to be with family and resume her TV acting career, he is stunned. She explains that her dreams and ambitions have been stifled by focusing on his career, and despite her numerous attempts to discuss this, he has never bothered to take her seriously. Oh, and she's taking their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) with her.<br/><br/>What follows is a masterclass in writing, acting, directing, editing, and human nature. We watch as Nicole builds the foundation of her new life, while Charlie is staggered - not so much in denial, as disbelief. Their initial course of an amicable split, equitable division of belongings, and shared/split custody of Henry is abruptly altered when Nicole takes counsel from powerhouse LA divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw. Complicating matters is the bi-coastal nature of the divorce and California laws. This forces Charlie to meet with attorney Bert Spitz (a terrific Alan Alda), who may or may not be up to the task - his acumen varying from day to day.<br/><br/>Baumbach allows both sides to play out. These are basically normal, good people in a situation that brings out the worst traits in both. Unsparing pain arises at every turn. One particular argument between Charlie and Nicole is the axis on which the movie turns. It's a spilling of guts and filled with devastating honesty. The scene is relentless and builds to a breakdown or breakthrough ... any description leaves us spent. Just when we don't believe we can handle any more emotional turmoil, up pops a moment of genuine tenderness that restores our faith - even if it's only long enough for us to breathe again. There are even some surprisingly funny (dark humor) moments sprinkled throughout, just as there is in life.<br/><br/>Supporting roles are filled beautifully by Ray Liotta, Julie Hagerty, Merritt Weaver and Wallace Shawn. As Henry, Azhy Robertson avoids the ""cute-kid"" syndrome and delivers an actual nuanced performance by a child actor. Although it seems they are both everywhere these days, Ms. Johansson and Mr. Driver are truly outstanding in their roles here. Scarlet perfectly captures a woman moving on, while Adam singing Stephen Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" at the bar in front of his theatre company is one of the most poignant on screen moments of the year.<br/><br/>There have been some amazing movies about marriage/divorce over the years. Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1974), Benton's KRAMER VS KRAMER (1979), and Farhadi's A SEPARATION (2011) come to mind. Baumbach's latest belongs in that group. Even the ""best"" divorces - those where both sides end up better off - are a ""loss"" for both parties. At a minimum, it's a loss of a once-in-time vision of life partnership. The division of assets is a cold term for the shredding of emotions. We are fine with whatever the adults decide as long as the priority for both is their young son who shouldn't pay the price for their debacle ... but certainly will, just as countless other children have. I'm only now able to write about this film after seeing it at the inaugural North Texas Film Festival (NTXFF). As a movie lover, I'm in awe of the acting and storytelling. As a human being, it temporarily destroyed me."

It must be ""Divorce Story"" not Marriage Story"
"Danusha_Goska","6","6","13","17 December 2019"," Not As Insightful or Compelling as Baumbach Wants It to Be
","""Marriage Story"" is overrated. Yes, I get it that some viewers are sobbing while watching it and insisting that it perfectly captures their own divorce, or the divorce of their parents. ""Marriage Story"" didn't do that for me. Alan Alda, as a nice guy divorce lawyer, Laura Dern, as a diabolically manipulative, slinky-dress and high-heeled-shoe wearing lawyer, and Ray Liotta as the ultimate shark divorce lawyer, were the best things about this movie. Their parts are written and performed with great skill and they satisfied me greatly.<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are fine, but their characters simply aren't written as compellingly as writer-director Noah Baumbach wanted them to be. Baumbach was shooting for a tear-jerker where the two characters were equally sympathetic and the divorce was a great, unavoidable tragedy.<br/><br/>I was bored while watching this over-long movie. I didn't feel that a whole heck of a lot was at stake. The phrase ""First world problems"" kept going through my head. Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are both young, healthy, good looking, wealthy, blessed with many supportive friends, and enjoying great careers in show business. I saw no insurmountable obstacle that made the divorce inevitable. Two people committed to a marriage could have worked out Charlie and Nicole's problems. That they chose not to do so is their own choice and I can't be made to care more about their marriage than they do.<br/><br/>Also, the divorce itself didn't strike me as such a big deal. So what if they get divorced? Why should I care? Both will be with another equally gorgeous, successful show business spouse in no time.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie: many long scenes where Charlie and Nicole tell each other or someone else what they like and don't like about each other, themselves, or their marriage. These scenes don't drive any plot and they didn't involve me or get me to care. ""Marriage Story"" opens with a scene of Charlie and Nicole reading lists of things they love about each other. Again, I was bored. I just did not care that Nicole cuts Charlie's hair well or that Charlie closes the cabinets Nicole neglects to close.<br/><br/>For a long time I kept waiting for a scene that would make me care. I kept waiting for some insight, some plot development, that would make me gasp and not regret spending two hours listening to rich, lucky people whine about a problem that they created themselves. That scene never came. One line made me nod: Charlie tells Nicole that she doesn't want her own voice; rather, she wants to whine about not having her own voice.<br/><br/>Some masterful plots throw two antagonists up against each other and cause me to debate within myself which antagonist I sympathize with. ""Marriage Story"" did not perform that legerdemain for me. The script is weighted in Charlie's favor. Nicole is not giving saving the marriage her all. Charlie is more invested. A woman who quits so easily on a commitment to a desirable man who is the father of her young son, a son who clearly loves his father, is not compelling to me."

In the end I got the irony of the title and the power of this movie.<br/><br/>It's hard, I would say, to make a movie that is so present in our lives, and so distant of Hollywood, that it feels like something else. But Noah Baumbach did that, he made it real. And that's the major point here. Because with movies, you keep imagining what will happen ten minutes from now, or in the end. But this one... it takes you to that moment as if that moment is happening right now. As if the destinies of the characters are not already settled.<br/><br/>And with each moment it gives you something new to think about. Eventually, if you are lucky, you start to see yourself in that situation. And cinema that gives clarity to people is art.<br/><br/>This is art. A little piece of powerful cinema. I not only like Marriage Story, I respect it. I respect what they decided to do, and how successful they were. A tough story to put on your shoulders, but Noah Baumbach and co. couldn't get better results.<br/><br/>With this movie, Netflix was able to show that they can provide.

","This movie will play differently to different people. For me, it hit close to home. Growing up in a broken family, I had to start dealing with parent issues when I was 6. I remember things vividly. My mom running away with me in the night. The fights. The split. The divorce and endless battle over things. Going to my dad's on the weekend and a variety of other things. This movie displays that like nothing else ever has.<br/><br/>Despite both parties wanting a clean divorce, it also shows how nasty that can become. It's frustrating to experience and just as frustrating to watch on screen.<br/><br/>Adam and Scarlett have standout performances in this film. We all know what Scarlett can do. We also know what Adam is capable of but I believe this is one of his best roles on display here.<br/><br/>It was interesting to me since this movie didn't have violence. My parent's divorce and I've seen many friends that had nasty divorces with violence included. While depressing, it was still somewhat refreshing to see this situation play out with no violence.<br/><br/>The only aspect of this film that falls short to me is how the couple is tied up with acting. That's fine and I'm sure things like this happen with relationships in Hollywood but it made the film a little pretentious. It became a battle of one person's career in theatre/Broadway in NY vs another person's TV career in LA. It made it tough to relate and while the plot tried to remain focused on the kid as being the reason, I couldn't get past it.<br/><br/>There could be best actor/actress chances behind this film going in to rewards season but It's not taking any technical or best picture awards. I could also see some screenplay nods here.<br/><br/>This film is certainly worth the watch. It'll likely be one of the films remembered when you see it come up but I doubt it'll be revisited as years go by."

","""Marriage Story"" is the tale of the marriage breakup of two affluent New York people...Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie (Adam Driver). Nicole is well known actress who has been working in Charlie's theater group. Charlie is an award winning director whose plays sometimes reach Broadway.<br/><br/>Nicole receives an offer from Hollywood to star in a TV pilot. Unhappy in her marriage, she goes off to Los Angeles to pursue her career. Charlie continues to work with his theater group. Nicole is supposed to return to New York after completing the pilot but it is picked up as a series and therefore she wants to stay in California with their young son.<br/><br/>Charlie on the other hand, wants to remain in New York and wants Nicole to return there. Their disagreement results in their wanting to get a divorce. At first the agree to settle the dispute without legal representation. Working with a mediator who had them write out their feelings about each other, fails.<br/><br/>Everything seems to be going along nicely when a co-worker in Hollywood suggests to Nicole to hire famous divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) to handle her case. When Charlie comes to LA to visit their son, he is served with divorce papers, much to his surprise. Charlie is then forced to hire his own lawyer. He first goes to high end lawyer Jay (Ray Liotta). His no-nonsense and very expensive approach discourages Charlie.<br/><br/>Charlie next goes to aging lawyer Bert Spitz (Alan Alda) who works much cheaper. When the couple and their respective councils meet, Charlie discovers that Spitz will be unable to adequately represent him and fires him in favor of the more expensive aggressive Jay. Then the gloves come off and..........................<br/><br/>I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this film and ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" (1979). Both are fighting over the custody of a young son, both have the wife running off to California and both hire expensive attorneys to do battle on their behalf. The final result is also quite similar.<br/><br/>The acting in :Marriage Story"" is superb. Johansson and Driver in the leads give Oscar worthy performances. The film is also grace with a stellar supporting cast with Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta standing out as various bottom feeding attorneys.

","Writer/director Noah Baumbach's execution of this masterpiece is simply brilliant. Anyone who has loved, will relate on a personal level. Some of the negative reviews share common themes: comparison with Kramer vs Kramer... yes, this is about a couple with a child who decide to divorce. However, whereas the focus is on the Dad in Kramer, Marriage story is more about the couple's relationship unwinding in spite of the fact that they still care very much about each other. Another common complaint labels this story as ""self indulgent"". I do not understand this complaint. Many of the most famous writers, including Hemingway, Graham Greene, and Joseph Conrad (for example) poured very personal experience into their works. I suspect that Noah Baumbach put his own soul into Marriage Story. This story is personal and gritty. If you don't cry, you're one of the lucky folks who has never had to say goodbye to a lover."

","Marriage Story is flat out brilliant film and one of the years finest films. It's a raw film which doesn't feel Hollywoodized and that's such a great thing.
Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are incredible, not only delivering their best performances in their career but some of the best performances in quite sometime. They are outstanding. Azhy Robertson was also really great and he isn't an annoying child actor thankfully.<br/><br/>It is really hard hitting especially in the second half. It doesn't feel to over the top.

It's extremely well written and feels really authentic and it's a somewhat of a sad and emotional film because of that.<br/><br/>Overall it is fantastic and seriously worth watching.

","Marriage Story have an incredible look at a marriage breaking up. This is a subject that many other movies had explored in the past, but this one has the more patient and humanist look at it. We see this couple, after several years of marriage, struggling to move on together. Some viewers can be somewhat bored because they know already how divorce works, but this is not the goal of Marriage Story.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach, with its script and directing, dissects this divorce, including how are the character's feelings and thoughts about this unfortunate situation. That dissection is helped by an incredible duo of performances; Adam Driver and especially Johansson which is easily, her best performance ever. The rest of the cast brings some energy and comedy on a sad tone story. Baumbach's camera shows the confrontation of a family being separated, yet wanting to be together again, which leads to some very emotional scenes. But we can complain a bit about the original score by Randy Newman; his music is well composed, but some sequences that already impactful are a bit over-dramatized.<br/><br/>At the end, Marriage Story is a heartbreaking film that'll shines this award season thanks to the wonderful cast, skillful directing and script, and proving that Netflix, again this year, isn't playing around with the audience.<br/><br/>Marriage Story's rating: 8.0/10"

","This is one of the most emotionally beautiful films I have ever seen. It's like if peeling an onion caused you to laugh instead of cry, but still activated your tear ducts.<br/><br/>
This film is a love story about divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver), who is a well-known theatre Director about to take his play to Broadway, and Nicole, (Scarlett Johansson) who has become a well-known actress due to starring in Charlie's plays, meet in this industry and marry living a life together with their son Henry. Ten years into their marriage, Charlie and Nicole decide to divorce amicably without lawyers until Nicole hires a lawyer unannounced and things start to become worse than initially intended.<br/><br/>DIRECTION:
Noah Baumbach (not to be confused with Johan Sebastian Bach) did a spectacular job taking a sad subject and showing such purity and grace. The movie is so grounded causing it to feel like two real people who truly love each other going through this tough time. Baumbach also creates a theatrical feel to the film. He does this by having long drawn-out scenes coupled with beautiful dialogue usually only between only 2-3 characters at once.<br/><br/>WRITING:
I have to double down with what I said under ""DIRECTION."" The writing is so pure and real, that it feels like you are truly watching the emotional nature of divorce. You truly feel like you're watching a documentary on two people struggling to balance their secretive resentment and love for each other. I always say that my favorite films are those that can keep me engaged strictly through dialogue and this is a perfect example.<br/><br/>ACTING:
Adam Driver me to the Oscars to watch you receive this reward. Oh my goodness and gracious. There's a specific performance in a scene between Mr. Driver and Ms. Johansson that I think could easily by itself deliver an Oscar for both of them. This is also coming off a great performance in ""The Report"" (Adam Driver) and an amazing supporting role in Jojo Rabbit (Scarlett Johansson). Not to mention the superb supporting cast with the likes of Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. This incredible ensemble really takes the film to another realm of realism and beauty.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
Marriage Story does what it is set out to do and that is make you feel. Through the Direction, Writing and Acting, this film doesn't make you pick sides or dread so much the process of what can be a very dreadful process. Although the story at it's core is sad, this is also one of the funniest movies of the year and it makes me feel like I'm going through a painful divorce with the same feelings that both Charlie and Nicole feel. I still need to see Uncut Gems, Richard Jewell, Little Women, etc., but as of right now this takes the #1 spot in my top 10 in 2019."

"FilmFlowCritics","8","10","26","8 October 2019"," A hate it or love it scenario
","This is a movie a lot of people responded to with great emotions, for various reasons. Maybe some of those people went through a divorce themselves or were kids who's parents split up. While I am part of the second group, let me tell you why this movie emotionally didn't touch me at all, but why it's also still a good movie!<br/><br/>Hands down.... this movie has one of the best opening scenes I have ever seen and I kind of expected something like this after watching the trailer. It drags you in right from the start and you know you are in for 135min of a difficult character piece. I need to say it right from the get go... Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are fantastic in it. The way they feed of each other, in this broken dynamic of a couple that went from love to hate, is mesmerising and you completely forget that they are acting, you feel like the invisible child that is witnessing its parents fight and you want to stop them fighting, but you can't.<br/><br/>Giving the audience that feeling is by no means accidental I think. The great camera work deserves a big shout out here! I think there are clearly 2 ways to look at that movie, the female and the male side. As I'm male myself, maybe I auto side with the husband in this scenario (I hope not) but I haven't seen Scarlett Johansson in a role that I hated her more in. Sure, the behaviour of the husband wasn't perfect either, but while the audience is lead to believe that the husband is the victim, this role can shift over (at a later point) to the wife becoming the ""victim"" and no one thinks about that the real victim here is the child who's stuck in the middle of all of this.<br/><br/>This movie is no joy ride and I tend to say that it should have been 30min shorter. Especially the musical scenes in the end felt like ""to much"". Sure, I get it, it's a reference to the Broadway theme, but it just felt out of place. Maybe this movie is a bit to long by design, to make you feel the dread and despair as a divorce, especially when it gets so dirty, is a process that goes on for much longer than you think it should.<br/><br/>I give it a 7.4/10 where the acting is clearly the highlight of the movie and I wouldn't be surprised if Driver and/or Johansson would be rewarded for their performances!"

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","8","20","29 November 2019"," Full of love despite being about a divorce.
","'Marriage Story (2019)' is full of love despite being about a divorce, taking time to establish that its focal couple don't stop caring about one another just because their marriage has drifted to an end. The piece is chock full of emotion, ranging from domestic bliss to raging agony, and it's ultimately rather nuanced, maintaining a sly sense of humour throughout most scenes. There are no winners or losers, just fallible people fumbling through their upturned lives. In this way, the affair is rather refreshing. It tells a simple tale with (comparatively) small stakes but makes it utterly compelling, equally as heart-wrenching as hopeful. The two leads are at the top of their game, proving you don't need a lightsaber or a leather suit to truly connect with an audience. Indeed, you don't need them - or any other weapons - to craft what's nearly the most devastating fight scene of the year. The experience is pretty universal, something often experienced but rarely seen, and it's incredibly effective. It's also rather affecting, hitting home hard on a number of occasions. There's not much else to say: it's a well-made and engaging drama that deserves to be seen. This sort of thing doesn't grace the big screen as often as it should, which is why it's a shame that it has been relegated to a limited release before its Netflix debut. Its only flaw is that the occasionally over-played, mile-a-minute screenplay doesn't always give its events enough time to berate - though, it often does - and that its 'both sides' perspective sort of leads to a film of two halves in which you don't fully connect with either party because you tend to leave their perspective. The screenplay is great and you do care about the characters, don't get me wrong. It's just that those areas are clearly weak-spots - minor weak-spots but weak-spots nevertheless. Overall, the movie is great. If you own Netflix, you've no reason to skip it. 7/10"
"JankiSharma","9","8","20","19 November 2019"," A story well told
","Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach is about a marriage between ""two good looking "" people involved actively in world of theater. Wife Nicole( talented Scarlett Johansson from Vicky Christina Barcelona) Husband Charlie (Adam Driver from my favorite movie BlacKkKlansman) have a son Henry (Azhy Robertson know him from the movie Juliet , naked)and have lived in NY for 10 years as husband and wife. And then Nicole and Henry move to Los Angeles to be with Nicole's mom and sister. The marriage already had problems and Nicole wants a divorce. The whole marriage situation and separation which turns into filing of a divorce is shown very well. The best part of movie is Divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw ( played very well by Laura Dern) who has a great understanding of why Nicole should get a divorce , child custody and probably money too from her husband Charlie. Nora, beautiful and stylish, is confident, fearless and knows how to win. Her confidence makes Nicole feel meek. Nicole feels Nora is too aggressive. Love between Nicole and Charlie comes and goes . Anger and frustration about turn of their relationship drives Charlie towards anger and Nicole towards self pity. Nicole's need for her husband in every aspect of her life cannot be met by husband Charlie. The decisions they made about never involving lawyers goes into thin air when Nicole involves Nora as her lawyer. Screenplay is great. Laura Dern deserves an Oscar for portraying a lawyer who is compassionate towards the woman in a divorce and at the same time applauds the husband for his talents. Entire cast did a great job. It was truly a pleasure to watch Jay (Ray Liotta )as Charlie's lawyer. Jay is a street-smart lawyer and very competitive unlike Charlie's other lawyer, Bert, who is aging and feels sorry for Charlie( well acted by Alan Alda). Charlie's helplessness in divorce case is shown well by his change of lawyer from Jay to Bert and then back to Jay. Marriage from different angles definitely makes a great story. Oscar worthy acting."

","A good divorce film provides enough suspense for all the audience, married or unmarried. Marriage Story not only keeps you hooked until the end to see how the story of two used-to-be love birds unfold, but also it is the lead actors, Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, taking your breath away. After all, it is more of a two-character study film rather than a plot-driven one.<br/><br/>Inspired by director Noah Baumbach's personal divorce story from screen star Jennifer Leigh in 2013 and also his parents' , Marriage Story has artistic passion for expression flowing in its blood. Noah Baumbach had proved his mastery in Frances Ha; a film very much inspired by Woody Allen. Storytelling, dialogue, comedy yet melancholy feeling, and use of music is like Woody Allen's earlier films. He has borrowed elements of Woody Allen's cinema once again and added his own personal touch to it in Marriage Story. A story which laughs you out, makes you cry and puts you in the dilemma of which side to take; Nicole or Charlie. This very unbiased narrative is what makes Marriage Story truly distinct from other divorce films.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson masterfully depicts Nicole, a one-time movie actor longing to get a name for herself and surpassing his successful Broadway director husband. She constantly speaks of Charlie's workaholism and inattention to her, one problem that is unfortunately more told rather than shown.Nicole's career arc and her transform from a mediocre theater actor to a director in Hollywood after the divorce, is the feminist theme of the film. Just like which side to take in terms of husband or wife, you are in the very dilemma of which actor performed on a greater level. Undisputedly, Marriage Story is the film that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have performed their career-best. Even better than Blackkklansman for Adam driver and Under The Skin for Scarlett Johansson. Charlie, played by Adam Driver, is the neat, ambitious and sweet husband every woman craves for.Unsurprisingly Nicole's family loves him. But even him ends up cheating his wife. After all, he is the thriving director in broadway, everyone wants to sleep with him. In the terrific fight sequence taking place in Charlie's apartment in LA, Charlie personally tells Nicole that he could've slept with any woman he wanted after his success but because of his loyalty to her, he did not.A loyalty he did not keep after having affairs with his production designer Marry Ann.
Without knowing what she is walking herself into, Nicole naively goes to the attorney her mother told her to, Nora, powerfully played by Laura Dern.She is the genuine representative of feminism. Nicole's action leaves dazzled Charlie no choice but to get himself an attorney; one that could bite as hard as Nora. At first Charlie meets the bulldog Jay (Ray Liotta, what a performance, so harsh that makes you smile), realizing Jay's methodology does not fit in his ethics, he goes to another lawyer. Bert is the opposite of what Jay is, as relaxed as one could be.<br/><br/>Marriage Story's cinematography is beautiful. Robbie Ryan, who was also the cinematographer of gorgeous award-winning The Favorite, demonstrates his excellency yet again. The soft, simplistic image that you would expect from a realistic film, combined with warm and lively colors, makes you feel about the film the way it is intended to; sad-and-funny. Robbie Ryan manages to demonstrate the emotional position the two main sides are in using meticulous framing, how distant they are, and camera angle choices, how up or down they are. Let's not also forget that any film that is shot on film in the digital age deserves a special credit.<br/><br/>Journey of Marriage Story ends not with character arc but 'letter arc'.A letter that was not read aloud is read aloud. Charlie's and Nicole's face clearly reveal that nothing will be the same after this journey. But is this change for the good or the worse?<br/><br/>Marriage Story is not a film to be missed."

Noah-what ? Sorry, never heard him, ok he's got an oscar nomination, but...what's that movie he was nominated for ? Gotta watch it...he's so bloody good. The director and the movie picks up all the nuances of a failing marriage...well almost. The dialogue is so real that you start imagining yourself there ( you will know what I mean , if you're married). Two successful people but flawed parents, yet basking in the unblemished love of an adorable child. Sensitive portrayal of the central characters keep you engrossed. The only flaw is the sanitization of the mess a divorce creates. The protagonists are seemingly well-off , so , howmuchsoever they talk about the expenses and the fallout , the pain doesn't cut deep. So nobody sheds a tear at the end of this drama."

","A well made drama about family love, sacrifice, denial, conflict, failure, change and acceptance. A very down to earth ""real life"" film with a very strong script and superb acting by well established actors who were able to showcase their acting skills at a higher level (especially the casts that portrayed the parents & lawyers) due to the good material and directing in this film. Even the main child actor did a good job and looked genuine in delivering his role.<br/><br/>The movie portrays the beauty of family life especially the small details of affection and the act of taking care of each other whilst slowly revealing the underlying resentment of unresolved conflict, unkept promises and unfulfilled ambitions, from both sides in the relationship.<br/><br/>The movie also has a late 80s & early 90s vibe to it due the hairdos, dress ups, furnishing, sets and the colour tone of the movie even though you can see it is not truly set in those periods by the look of the cars, handphones and other technologies seen in the film. All this done in a good way to catapult your mind deeper in the drama and especially nostalgic for those who were kids and adults during those eras.<br/><br/>I think some aspects of the movie pays homage to the film Kramer vs Kramer which was great."

","Aristotle, unless he reconciled to the more outrageous conceits of Euripides, would have had a fit. Is the movie comedy? Tragedy? A musical? A travelogue? The lawyers are vaudeville. The sister (of Nicole) can't act. The mother is irritating. The dialogue is insipid. The Wallace Shawn characters comment (intended for what?) is imbecilic. Why does Charlie break into song? If the film tracks the real-life divorce of the director, that life needs a director. I suggest Woody Allen. The movie is neither entertaining, nor is it instructive."

"msunando","9","2","3","24 March 2020"," Poignant, real and convincing performances
","Marriage Story - Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) could have been a star after a successful debut film, but chose to join Charlie (Adam Driver), a talented and rising theatre director whose vision she shares and eventually marries. With the passage of time Charlie grows prolific with fame, maturity and authority, whilst Nicole settles down to become the leading lady of his productions and creative pursuits, living his dreams as hers too. For many years, she remains agnostic to her own aspirations, becoming Charlie's muse, wife, a mother to the lovable Henry and a caring housewife.<br/><br/>It's business as usual until Nicole realizes that she has sacrificed far too much of her own self for Charlie but the latter has taken her devotion for granted. In the process, she has lost her individuality and almost forgotten who she actually is, and he doesn't care. She decides to file for divorce from Charlie amid the seemingly happy and stable status, taking him off guard completely. Marriage Story is a narrative of the common people shaken up by the disruption of a happy matrimony and a humdrum life. It is a deep dive into the character of a stereotypically patriarchal and almost misogynistic head of the family who believes everything is normal as long as the family seems to be happy and old, unfulfilled promises made aren't being dug into. It is also about the predicament of a child who is facing a family meltdown, watching helplessly as the parents drift apart.<br/><br/>The treatment of the sombre subject by the writer and director Noah Baumbach is the strength of Marriage Story, it is kept natural, sans melodrama. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson bring out the depths of their respective characters with ease and conviction. The sequence where the couple finally confronts each other releasing the pent up agony and frustration is hugely believable and poignant. Laura Dern's essay of Nicole's lawyer Nora Fanshaw is sterling, especially the scene where she counsels Nicole about the perceptions about mothers and their model code of conduct."
"votedavepurdy","10","2","3","22 March 2020"," Brilliant Performances!!!!
","This movie takes the overdone idea of a divorce and makes it incredibly captivating. While everyone's performance is brilliant, Adam Driver is pure genius in every scene. When you watch this film, and you really need to, ask yourself this; if Nicole and Charlie had read their lists at the beginning of the film, would they still be together at the end? As a man who has been married for almost 20 years, this movie goes a long way to showing the importance of communication in making a marriage work. Great movie!"

"aalleekk1989","8","2","3","22 December 2019"," A decent film about the transformation of a relationship, but it is not a romantic movie
","This is a film about the complexity of relationships - how two people can be so deeply connected yet so utterly disconnected at the same time. While the film focuses on a tiny window through the entirety of a decade long relationship, it was a transformational moment, the culmination of years of communication breakdown and growing apart. The divorce lawsuit gave both a chance of reality check - through the eyes of the lawyers and the judicial system, they were forced out of their own narrative to re-examine what happened to their relationship, which roles they played in the sequence of events, as well as how to go forward with the best interest of the child in mind. In the process, they also went from being self-centric and directing emotions outwards, to being more inner looking and empathetic. In the end, decisions about relationships are highly personal and subjective. Good or bad, relationships can never go back to where they were once upon a time. The film captures this aspect of life very well.<br/><br/>The actors did a phenomenal job and the music choices are excellent. However, I do feel at times that the film dragged a bit. In additional, beware that many emotional and plot transitions are subtle, yet closely connected. The actors delivered that brilliantly, but not every viewer caught those slight shifts in the details, which is reflected on some of the confusion or frustration about the movie expressed in the reviews written here. It is not a film about romance, or evil lawyers, or parental responsibilities. Unfortunately, the trailer is a bit misleading and some viewers probably had a different expectation going in.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a well-made film and I recommend it to people who are interested in movies about relationships that have healthy amount of realism and maturity."

","This was a very disturbing, depressing, and difficult to watch eye-opener movie from Noah Baumbach. So this was what divorce in real life looks like and FEELS like? I felt HORRIBLE by just watching it; I cannot imagine what it must feel like to be the people going through a divorce. Thank these parents for sparing the kid's feelings and psychological well-being because if they had not they would have traumatized him for life.<br/><br/>After the movie ended and the credits were rolling and ""Shouting and Shopping"" by Randy Newman was playing, I was just in a daze. It is never claimed in the movie, but this film must definitely be based on real life events, maybe on the director/writer's own divorce.<br/><br/>My own thoughts on the plot: this marriage was never meant to last because each party wanted a different line of work in a different coast of the U.S. from years before they ever even met. One party got their way meaning that the other party gave in. One party was completely selfish and self-centered and focused only on their career goals, and completely failed to see and allow the other party to pursue their career goals. One party was very patient for as long as humanely possible until it was no longer humanely possible to forget their career goals. They should have never fallen in love with each other, but unfortunately they did. Both parties wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite parts of the U.S. and unfortunately for them they made a third party that tied them together.<br/><br/>At first I sided with one party thinking they had been patient and selfless and felt disgusted by the other party who had been so selfish and self-centered from day one and not only that but completely failed to see the other party's wishes and desires even after such party explicitly spelled it out for them. But then I realized that this marriage was never supposed to work in the first place since both wanted completely different lines of work in completely opposite sides of the country. They should have not married and made a third party.<br/><br/>Moral of this story: do not fall in love with someone that wants to work in something completely different on the other side of the country.<br/><br/>I watched this movie knowing absolutely NOTHING about it. I knew it was a Netflix movie and that it got an Oscar, but that is it. So the whole plot was a complete shock to me.<br/><br/>Conclusion: very difficult film to watch; it surely is based on real life events and it portrayed well how horrible a divorce is. But I learned a valuable lesson or two.<br/><br/>10/10"
"melinetto","7","1","1","5 July 2020"," perfect acting all over the place
","Even though the title of the film is ""Marriage Story"" but that's ironic 'cause Noah Baumbach tells a story about divorce. In another words, it can be said craving for love or longing for the past.
First of all, there are some incredible performances, just terrific. The best performance of Scarlett Johansson i've ever seen. She plays the character of Nicole so perfectly. And Adam Driver is so amazing aswell. I think that he will perform just like this one in different films in the future. The actors who plays the secondary characters make the best of their roles. Laura Dern, who i always think that she's an amazing actress, is just perfect. Ray Liotta who plays Jay Marotta who is an ambitious and successful lawyer performs very well in spite of the short screen time.
I've read and heard various comments about the movie. Although the story is seemed by the perspective of Charlie i think that's an objective point of view from the director. As a matter of fact, i've read that Noah Baumbach writes the story about his own experiences. In fact, he sent the script to his ex-wife Jennifer Jason-Leigh and she loves it. In this regard, it can be said that there's some auto-biographical feature in this film. Because of that, maybe the writer is on ""Charlie's side"" a little bit but as i said, i think that the movie is impartial. So, i think that the audiences understand completely why Nicole wants a divorce and why Nicole can't have self-fulfillment in that marriage.
There are a lot of scenes that are memorable. For example, the beginning sequence, the scene that Nicole opens up Nora, the scene that the monologue of Laura Dern about ""the mother is always perfect"", the scene which is Adam Driver sings ""Being Alive"" that's the excellent piece of Stephen Sondheim, the scenes with the halloween and Charlie's loneliness, the scene that Charlie talks on the phone with Nora and exits the theater and finds himself in crowded street of NYC, the scene that Nicole and Charlie face off and Charlie shows the burst of emotion, the scene that Charlie reads Nicole's letter with his son Henry and many more...
Frankly, the movie is very well directed and written and the actors are so amazing but i've seen some excessive comments how perfect the film is. I can't quite understand what the fuss is all about even though i like it and i think that it's a quality one."

It's hard to feel sorry for jet setting 30 somethings who've had such successful, artistically satisfying lifestyles, a healthy, well adjusted child and tons of extra money to throw around on weekend trips and elaborate Halloween costumes.<br/><br/>The movie makes a couple subtle nods to their Insane privilege and/but I ultimately did NOT care about these people and their trivial problems.

This is one of those movies you know it's not gonna be the mindblowing, life-changing film, but it's such an amazing realistic view on the subject that entertains surprisingly enough the viewer. Dialogues that not only develop the story but express and describe the inner world of people who are tearing their family apart.

"ylshu-66191","10","1","1","22 June 2020"," Marriage Story
","There is always a dialogue in my mind when I watch a movie: do you know what is the saddest thing in life? Love but not, get but not love. It's not sad, it's just life. When you die one day, what you remember before you die is these, which can be called regret. Then what is sorrow? Maybe you clearly love someone, but you can't understand everything about him, so you mistakenly interpret his kindness as cowardice, his care as stubbornness, his boredom as betrayal, and your two people's past as mistakes. Is this the essence of marriage? The essence of marriage is loneliness. Just like the essence of life, people always want to achieve something, always want to stay with someone, or become someone, but finally they put their whole self into it. Is love destined to be false? There is nothing more real than love, so a person must bear his loneliness alone."
"AlanRodriguezCastillo","10","1","1","13 June 2020"," Heartbreaking Masterpiece
","Marriage Story is directed by Noah Baumbach and stars Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Azhy Robertson and is about the struggle and eventual split of the married couple played by Driver and Johansson. I love this movie. Noah Baumbach' direction is some of the sharpest I saw in 2019. You can tell he put time into every single detail which for some people might not mean anything or maybe it's so seem less that you don't even notice that it has an effect on what's happening. He does this thing with the movie where in the first half he kind of makes you side with Johansson, while in the second half he makes you side with Driver. You can really see that they are trying to work things out so that they're family isn't torn apart and so that their kid isn't affected negatively. Even if you haven't been through that you might be able to connect. Johansson gives the performance of her career in my opinion as she brings this humanity and vulnerability to this character which many other actresses could have easily not gotten through with the emotion or make her the villain some how but Johansson finds the perfect balance here and could not see anyone else playing her character. Adam Driver gives another amazing performance here. I truly felt for his character as he's getting dragged into this legal mess that is a divorce. I gotta give props to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern who make me hate their characters but still make them so human and understandable. The look of the film is unique with the framing of the film making it seem like it was filmed in a video camera and so does the color in the film. The score too is incredible and I have to say without the music of Randy Newman some the emotional scenes could have felt cringeworthy or unwarranted but thankfully they land. I watched for the third time recently looking for flaws and I could not find a single one. I am going to give it a 10/10"

"filipovnanastassja","9","1","1","26 May 2020"," That's life
","Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>After hearing many good things about this film, and being quite interested in the subject - I've watched it with high expectations. Let me say - this is a very, very honest film. For as long as I can remember having opinion about film as an art form, I cherish movies that bring something personal and human to the screen. Most contemporary films lack this aspect, thus, are almost unwatchable for me. Marriage story is a story about two people who no longer see a reason to be together. Some will argue: oh, but the child!
But, the children we raise to become persons for themselves - not to tie them to us forever. I think many couples forget that. Children will eventually leave home but spouses shall remain together - unless there is no reason. I understood perfectly when Nicole Said: ""I will always love him."" It's not a romantic love - it's love towards another person - a person with whom you shared a portion of your life, but you do not wish to share bed or dinner every night with anymore. That's life. I've had s relationship that ended this way - the guys was my first love, first everything, but, at one point it didn't make sense anymore. Divorce also happens without ""obvious reasons"" as some complained that this movie doesn't show us all the reasons. But, when you lose yourself, when you feel like it's about someone else rather than about the two of you, and to feel it constantly, it can be crushing. Had she stayed with him, I can even imagine the flame of envy starting to spark. Obviously she has no strenght to fight, he doesn't feel like he's doing anything wrong - there are no goodies and baddies here. You can argue: she should at least try! Or say: he is too self-absorbed!
In both cases you'd be right - but in everyday life this is what really happens on so many occasions. People will not fight because they've been feeling like this for a long time and at this point they just want their way out.
As you can probably guess by now I think psychologically this film is amazing, what bothers me is maybe too biased ending: her getting Tony nomination (I felt like it's there for pure female empowerment, when art isn't supposed to be gender's maid) and new boyfriend while the husband is moving to work in Los Angeles - I felt like maybe the film had more sympathy to her, but, okay. I guess that's Hollywood's toll on this film: that's what's keeping it too much on the Hollywood terms. I said this is an honest film: it's not melodramatic and romantic, it has many practical and everyday problems, thus, I felt it should've ended in the same manner. Also, it nods to the kafkaesque atmosphere of the courtrooms and legal battles as well as to the modern theatre life, which I think is very cool.
Overall, deserves a watch!"

You barely even get to see them fighting, they do only twice during the entire movie. It's very beautifully shot, and some takes are dragged out creating some beautiful images throughout the movie.

","Marriage Story focuses on a story that isn't used too much in Hollywood. It's a story about a husband and a wife who separate while fighting for custody for their child. I didn't know much about Marriage Story, and just by the title I thought it would be a romantic drama, but it was far from it. Marriage Story talks about a situation that is far too common, and it's told very realistically which makes this film extremely relatable for most adults.<br/><br/>Although Marriage Story is a long movie, you never get bored; you're entertained in a weird way. A major pro that makes Marriage Story so realistic is the screenplay. Marriage Story touches on everything about divorces, the toxic lawyers, the sadness, the arguments, and the awkwardness. One thing that surprised me was how humorous Marriage Story is. There are these insane arguments within the movie, but somehow there's comedy that actually makes you laugh. With all these different emotions happening within two hours, Marriage Story becomes an emotional roller coaster.<br/><br/>The acting was done way too well; the crying is what made the movie feel real. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson prove that they can act their heart out in Marriage Story. They both portray these emotions that are so hard to act out, like awkwardness and anger. Noah Baumbach did a great job with developing the characters, making them like real people, with flaws and weaknesses that both destroy and maintain a marriage.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is film that I strongly recommend. It pulls all the emotions in the book, and it plays with those emotions constantly throughout the runtime. The screenplay was excellent by creating these characters that you would only meet in real life. The dialogue and acting also improved the viewing experience. So go ahead and enjoy Marriage Story, it's definitely an experience that's worthy having."

The acting is first rate, johansson is excellent, driver is absolutely outstanding - there's also a great supporting cast with the likes of ray liotta who does a quite slimy turn, Laura dern who is really obnoxious at times also and Alan alda who contrasts these two in terms of character.<br/><br/>Yet it doesn't quite have the emotional punch I was expecting. Sure there's emotional scenes but nothing too gut wrenching, this film is a lot more subtle than that and paced a lot more slowly than what I expecting and doesn't really have any kind of climax.<br/><br/>Driver makes this film though. He gives a fantastic, nuanced performance, and he makes it difficult for me to criticise the movie he is that good.<br/><br/>This is a really superbly acted film all round but it's a little self indulgent at times where I felt it needed to move things on - the singing sequence is a perfect example. I really wanted to love this film and I just didn't quite enough but really appreciate and respect the talent on display here.<br/><br/>It is good but extremely flawed in my view."
"ups-36964","4","1","1","2 May 2020"," Meh...
","It's a good movie, which has it's ups and downs. Let's see the positive aspects (pros):-<br/><br/>1) The acting is excellent. Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were amazing and realistic.
2)That argument scene b/w them and the courtroom scene, where the two lawyers argue were the best
3) It is quite relatable, especially for people like me, whose parents' relationships are not quite good<br/><br/>CONS:-
1) This film is too long or overstretched, slow and boring (except for few scenes)
2) The storyline is totally frustrating. Nicole turns out to be a b***h. She played with her husband's feelings. First, she didn't have sex with him for year, then when charlie sleeps with his co worker, she turns hyperactive, and hacks his computer. The lawyer she hires is also a b***h. Both of them plan a conspiracy to get the custody of the child. The social and emotional manipulation of the child is too annoying.
3) Charlie (Adam driver) is the one who has to suffer throughout. He did committed some mistakes, but his wife didn't even care to either have a discussion or come to an agreement. She simply plays with him. She forced him to move to LA. And the end, what he got, he lost his job in NYC, his company, his money, and most importantly, his child, coz he got only 45 per cent of custody, even through all his sacrifice. Ok, although this is just a story, but it hurts when people are dishonest and call the ending, beautiful and masterpiece. If, that's what american life is, then sorry it's quite weird and disturbing.
4) The law system is completely biased in the US. It's like favouring the women and bashing the men. When i googled it, i found each state has different law, which adds, why nicole moved to LA. It is both sad and laughable at the same time"

","""The story of marriage"" is soft and tender, touching gently the last traces of nostalgia between two broken marriages, all the worse for the worst as children fight. As I watched the movie, I kept thinking, why did they get to this point? And will all the couples in the world do better or worse under such downward circumstances? The wonderful memories they had of each other became so heartbreaking when their relationship broke up, but that was marriage."
"filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin","8","1","1","1 May 2020"," THAT THING YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT
","The thread of a Wedding Story seems to be divorce, but what director Noah Baumbach reveals is a glimpse of real-life in a relationship between two people. That thing you never talk about, regarding opposite and undesirable affections that arise, and what you see are two people who genuinely love each other by taking unthinkable and disloyal attitudes to each other.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, it's possible to know the strengths of the two protagonists. They write a description that each made about the other at the request of a mediator. We found out that Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is a loving mother, great listener, concerned about her mother and sister, and never closes the cabinet. Charlie (Adam Driver), on the other hand, is a talented and creative theater director, extraordinarily competitive and devours his meals.<br/><br/>Entering the intimacy of the couple, who has gone through previous crises, makes life difficult for the viewer accustomed to taking sides. Logically, some dirt on the couple is dug up. Charlie has already cheated on Nicole once and rarely takes her personal needs into account. Nicole goes to LA to film the pilot of a TV series and kind of kidnaps the couple's son to live there permanently, the fact that Charlie only learns of when he is surprised by the divorce papers.<br/><br/>The performances reinforce this documentary idea: both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are convincing in their performances. Each receives a monologue from the director: Charlie at the bar and Nicole with the horrible Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern, fantastic!). Also, there is a dialogue, or rather, an unthinkable argument, that famous final round in which one says what is not to be told and what is frightened is heard.<br/><br/>Rarely does the film sounds conventional or excessive, as in musical numbers, which perhaps worked better in the theater. But in general, it is a beautiful movie, a work of fiction that manages to scratch real life and makes us feel that the couple should be together, even though we know it would not work. Or it rather would."

"ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM","8","1","1","25 December 2019"," It's the little things
","Netflix's Marriage Story, written and directed by Noah Baumback (The Meyerowitz Stories) and starring Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie, tells the story of the divorce of two young artists at the beginning of their careers. She is a young actress known for a topless scene in her last movie (this is according to the people in this movie) and he is an avant garde theater director and head of his own company in New York City. When they meet by chance, they fall in love and she moves to NYC where she becomes the 'draw' for his theater company. Eventually, they have a son. At the beginning of the movie, they are getting a divorce after 10 years and are seeing a mediator in the hope of having a friendly divorce.<br/><br/>Is it a spoiler to tell you that a friendly divorce is rarer than a vegetarian meal at Mar-a-Lago? I knew a couple who mediated their divorce and everything was going well until they got to the jazz album collection (this was back in the day) which they were to split evenly. He objected - she didn't know Dizzy Gillespie from Dizzy Dean when I met her. She countered - yes, he introduced me to jazz but I was the one who actually bought and cared for our collection of over a 1000 albums - if it were up to him, he'd still be using his albums as coasters at the drunken parties he and his friends threw every week. And so much for mediation.<br/><br/>The upshot of Marriage Story is that good people get divorced and often do terrible things, things they'd never dream of doing except for the divorce. And that's what happens to Nicole and Charlie. The contested divorce legal process is unfair and incredibly expensive. Laura Dern is Nicole's lawyer and she explains to Nicole that she cannot admit to any wrong-doing or even any flaws since our world treats women/wives/mothers so differently than men/husbands/fathers. Women/wives/mothers must be like Mary, mother of Christ and a virgin to boot. Men are like Joseph - who is absent when the going gets tough and isn't even the actual father who is away somewhere doing whatever it is that gods do.<br/><br/>The other side is represented by Ray Liotta who tells Charlie that he had better get ready to be demonized and pay legal bills and costs that would make a lottery winner cringe. At first, Charlie is represented by a nice lawyer played by Alan Alda who tells him, ""We have to prepare to go to court hoping we don't go to court."" When Charlie sees that Dern is crushing Alda at a meeting, he switches to Liotta who can talk faster and be meaner than anybody else.<br/><br/>Along the way, there's a custody dispute. At the very beginning of the divorce, Nicole goes to LA to do a TV pilot (her first acting job outside her husband's company in a decade) and takes their son with her. The expectation is that she will return to NYC when the pilot is completed but then - she doesn't. Her family is in LA where she grew up and made a career as an actress. The money is exponentially better than doing theatre work. So, Charlie can only see his son by traveling cross country on weekends. As is usual in divorces where there are children, the child becomes the center of the divorce with each side claiming that it knows best for the child. Of course, the divorce is devastating to children, but that is a different movie and Baumbach concentrates on the adults.<br/><br/>It gets complicated quickly. The heart of the story is told in long takes where both Johansson and Driver communicate their rage at what is happening to them and the man/woman they loved. These longs takes show both Johansson and Driver's acting chops - each of them is able to build a scene to the point where real emotions are on display. The hateful argument they have at the end of the divorce process is contrasted with the tender affection for both their partner's qualities and deficiencies that they talk about at the beginning of the process. In fact, it is probably true to say that if you can find a person who loves not only your wit and charm, but your surliness and bad habits, then you should chase him/her until you catch him/her because that is the person who loves you.<br/><br/>Two songs from Sondheim's Company are sung - ""You Could Drive a Person Crazy"" by Nicole and her actress mother and actress sister, played beautifully by the under-appreciated Julie Haggerty and Merritt Wever, and ""Being Alive"" from the same musical sung by Driver. Each song speaks to what their characters are feeling about each other. Strangely, in Company, there is even a more appropriate song they could have sung - The Little Things You Do Together:<br/><br/>
It's the little things you share together,
Swear together,
Wear together,
That make perfect relationships.
The concerts you enjoy together,
Neighbors you annoy together,
Children you destroy together,
That keep marriage intact.<br/><br/>It's not talk of God and the decade ahead that
Allows you to get through the worst.
It's ""I do"" and ""you don't"" and ""nobody said that""
And ""who brought the subject up first?""
It's the little things,
The little things, the little things, the little things.<br/><br/>There is so much to recommend this movie that I hesitate to mention a few missteps. While money is mentioned, often, it isn't really talked about in substance. The fact is that many people never recover, financially, from a divorce. This is partially solved in the movie by a gift from the gods that drops in their lap during the divorce. A bigger problem is that Baumbach wants it both ways - the great angry scenes where people say things to each other that they don't mean, but once said can never be unsaid, and the happy ending. One of the best angry arguments that Nicole and Charlie have is negated by their embrace at its end. The fact is that arguments drive people further apart and don't end in an embrace but, usually, a slammed door. There are some maudlin scenes whose purpose is to show that they have moved on with their lives and are doing fine, and still think of each other with love and affection. And a divorce that ends that way is rarer than a 2-for-1 meal at Mar-a-Lago."

","I watched Marriage Story today and I kind of wished I hadn't. It's been just over 6 years since my separation/divorce from my former partner of 17 years and this film was about as enjoyable as actually going through a divorce. It admirably hits mostly all the right notes but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable. ScarJo is an engaging actress but lacks a centre that would suggest something soulful beyond that; this could be intentional on Baumbach's part. She is eventually out performed by Driver, though predictably, the film is weighted in favour of his character. The supporting players are fine with interesting contributions from Merrit Wever and Julie Hagerty as ScarJo's family; the spectrum of divorce lawyers is nicely covered from Alan Alda to Ray Liotta and Laura Dern, who may be in danger of becoming too much of a good thing or, at least, the same thing. (It will be interesting to see if her Marmee in the upcoming Little Women is an original creation or just another cross between Amy Jellico and Renata from BBL.)<br/><br/>Mostly this reminds me of Michael Haneke's Amour, a film I described as ""Disneyland for people who've never dealt with end of life issues."" Similarly, if you've ever been through a divorce, there's nothing in Marriage Story that makes the viewing of it at all edifying."

"Turfseer","8","7","19","21 November 2019"," Baumbach's chronicle of escalating stakes in divorce war hits the mark!
","With Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach has cemented his reputation as one of the more sophisticated screenwriters in Hollywood today. His film however should be more appropriately titled, ""Divorce Story,"" as his narrative is basically a distillation of the unraveling of a marriage. The couple in question is Nicole and Charlie, played with subtlety by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver. Their battle is over where their 8 year-old son Henry should be growing up-east or west coast, as it turns out.<br/><br/>
The film begins on a deliciously ironic note. We're treated to sets of voice overs from each of the principals, extolling the virtues of each others' personalities. On the surface it appears the marriage has not unraveled at all-yet.<br/><br/>
But as the camera pulls back, Nicole and Charlie are in a marriage counselor's office, reading off their assignments from the counselor-to praise each other, in an attempt to find common ground. But it's also immediately made clear that each party feels the marriage is irretrievably lost, despite the positive pronouncements in these essays they've been reading, in the opening sequence.<br/><br/>
We soon learn that Nicole, a talented actress, has supported Charlie, an up and coming director who runs his own theater company.in New York City. When Nicole has the opportunity to work on a pilot for a new TV show in Los Angeles, Charlie is under the impression that she and Henry will be returning to New York, after the TV opportunity wraps up-soon he discovers his assumption was incorrect (to put it mildly).<br/><br/>
Baumbach's focus is not primarily on the warring couple and their disagreement-that no doubt would not work for an entire movie. He draws the battle lines clearly, however: Nicole wants Charlie to recognize her quest for independence-and she ultimately intends to remain in LA with their child, where she has the opportunity to flower. Charlie can't countenance her demand, as his burgeoning career is wrapped up in everything New York City.<br/><br/>
It's how Baumbach chronicles the growing animus between them and the escalating conflict which proves so successful--coupled with how the deteriorating conflict proceeds in gripping increments, At first, the couple has agreed that they'll work the divorce out amicably-without attorneys present.<br/><br/>
All bets are off however when Nicole is introduced to Nora (a deliriously fine Laura Dern), as the ball-busting divorce attorney, who's an expert at representing female clients. Charlie, still hesitant about enlisting an attorney, briefly flirts with hiring Jay (a thoroughly believable Ray Liotta), the attack-dog attorney who charges over $900 per hour. Soon after learning from Nora he's in jeopardy of losing custody of Henry and most of his earnings, Charlie finally conscripts Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), who urges him to cut his losses and allow Nicole to keep Henry in LA.<br/><br/>
The stakes are exacerbated when Charlie drops Spitz and takes on Jay, who, in one of the best scenes in the film, duels with Nora in court, over Henry's fate. The judge ends up appointing an evaluator who will observe both parties in their interactions with Henry.<br/><br/>
The family court evaluation ends up in disaster for Charlie, who ends up cutting himself (and bleeding profusely) with his small pocketknife which he carries around habitually on a key chain (it doesn't help that the female evaluator is completely unemotional). This probably leads to Charlie throwing in the towel at film's end and agreeing to Nicole's demand to keep their child on the west coast.<br/><br/>
We can only conclude that Baumbach has done a bravura job in researching the vagaries of the divorce system-his superb characterizations of the attorneys involved are what ultimately give the film its compelling impetus.<br/><br/>
Marriage Story is also a character study-not only the chronicle of Nicole's quest for independence but Charlie finally realizing that his demand to have Nicole and Henry return to NYC was tied to narcissistic careerism (Charlie eventually ends up in LA anyway, working as a university lecturer).<br/><br/>
Baumbach also insightfully presents Nicole and Charlie's conflict as not entirely hateful. Even in Charlie's worst moment, when he has a meltdown in which he expresses his unbridled hatred for Nicole-there are still tender moments between them (as Charlie falls to his knees sobbing, Nicole cradles his head in her arms).<br/><br/>
Baumbach's direction is so good due to his all-star cast. Some of the scenes could have moved a little quicker and one wonders why he inserted such a self-indulgent scene where he has Driver sing that entire Sondheim song from Company at the nightclub.. But these are minor peccadillos, as Marriage Story turns out to be one of the top films of 2019, certainly worthy of a best picture Oscar nomination, at the very least."

","Sadly, and as puke-y and trite as it sounds, will this film be looked back upon as our generation's Casablanca? It is kind of a Love Story for today. So many people get divorced. So many people can relate to the bi-coastal life question: one spouse gets a great opportunity in LA or Silicon Valley; do they uproot and move? Another couple struggles with jobs that require regular trips to DC or Boston - do they need to live apart? What will that do to the marriage? What kind of resentment would turning down these opportunities create? It brings out all of these questions and many others...albeit for a thin slice of humanity; the story is pretty limited to the lives of rich white people. And it does reek of the obnoxious ""writers writing about writers"" phenomenon we see so often in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Both Johansen and Driver are awesome. The director being a man means the film skews a tad bit more in favor of the man and makes you more sympathetic to him. (The fact that he cheated - she did not - is really glossed over).<br/><br/>Despite the movie being about divorce, there is so much love here.

","Marriage story is a rooted, anti-melodramatic tale of a complicated divorce. And, it's also a MASTERPIECE !!! There's one particular scene involving the two leads in a room having a heated argument, that arrested me physically and melted me emotionally both at the same time. The argument scene is on par or in some ways even better than another similar favorite scene of mine from the Linklater movie 'Before Midnight'. It's one of the most well acted film of recent times. There are moments in the film that could be boring if not for the sheer presence of Adam driver and Scarlett Johansson. At no point are they acting, they're living the situation and that translates well into the audience. I wouldn't mind if both of the actors get a nod from the academy.<br/><br/>The film has lengthy but limited number of scene. Every scene takes time to build up, they're driven by life-like conversation, so it takes time to arrive at the point. But when it arrives, it hits hard, cheers to the time taken to build it up.<br/><br/>There's a lesson to be learned for up and coming writers, who are taught that you should enter the scene very late and exit as early as possible - there's a great reward for being patient."

one thing I did not like that much: the film was still made to sympathize with - him. Often we stay in his perspective, follow him as he takes phonecalls from her et cetera. ... yet the film 'acts' like it shows both personalities and motives equally.
To me it would have felt more real if both sides where shown equally.<br/><br/>Yet, the beginning of the movie was one of the best parts, the love letters felt - real. All the little things that makes a partner great were named... even if the main characters could not see them anymore at this given time.

Charlie then goes for the more pumped up and expensive Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) and both sides end up slinging mud at each other.<br/><br/>I suppose most of the male audience will sympathise with Charlie and would be more willing to see events from his point of view. He is an up and coming theatre director with a show moving to Broadway. Charlie is confused as to why Nicole has gone legalistic. He fears losing contact with his son, he realises the expense of getting divorced and that he will end up footing the bill.<br/><br/>Most of the female audience will sympathise with Nicole. She has fallen out of love with Charlie, she now feels held back and thinks she can do better in LA. She suspects Charlie might have had an affair.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with my wife and she certainly sided with Nicole.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a mature and intelligent movie. It doesn't take sides. Despite Charlie's and Nicole's best intentions of an amicable separation. They then repeat the same mistakes which thousands of other divorcing couple do the world over.<br/><br/>There is some humour in this movie, at times it is sad and raw. I did find the film overlong and the early part of the movie was slow paced."
"PyroSikTh","9","3","6","11 December 2019"," 90 Minute Build-Up to a Career Best Scene for Both Driver and Johansson
","An emotional drama about a divorce is not exactly the kind of plot I usually go for, but what immediately struck me about Marriage Story was the quintessential feeling Baumbach brings to all his films. He has an unparalleled talent in tapping into real life and writing dialogue that feels so incredibly natural and authentic that it makes it easy to forget you're watching a movie at all. We're immediately sucked into the life and relationship of Charlie and Nicole with a monologue each about they love about one another. This is probably the happiest and most uplifting the movie gets. As soon as we're dragged back to the marriage counselling, the bitterness starts to creep in and we're pushed down an ever-winding helter skelter. Once Nicole employs a ruthless lawyer to oversee the divorce, things between them get uglier than ever, and our preconceived notions of who they are and what they meant to each other degrades at a phenomenal speed.<br/><br/>Almost all of Baumbach's films revolve around the concept of communication, or more accurately miscommunication, and Marriage Story is no different. It's fundamentally about a couple who couldn't clearly communicate their wants and needs to one another, and continue to miscommunicate in their break-up. They use lawyers as mouthpieces, saying things and asking for things they don't actually want. They remain polite and nice to each other, holding back their feelings, and letting it build to silent resentment. This all starts from the beginning, with Nicole refusing to read her love letter out to Charlie, and later taking his notes on the chin and bursting into tears as soon as she turns the corner.<br/><br/>And this miscommunication builds and builds and builds in intensity until it has to explode, and it does so in full force right in front of the screen. The pivotal argument in Charlie's apartment single-handedly changed my opinion of this entire movie, and will be used from here on out as a display of how insanely talented both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are in front of the camera. All the truths between them are laid bare in a verbally violent altercation of the ages, in a single long shot. And yet neither Driver nor Johansson stutter or fall into caricature. They deliver their lines with equal intensity both rage and misery, and it's hard not to feel for both of them and what they've been through together and individually. So intense is the scene that I actually had to take a deep breath afterwards to compose myself. It's so viscerally raw and emotional to watch that I felt drained and overwhelmed by the time it was over.<br/><br/>It goes without saying, but this film was a career best for both Driver and Johansson, each of them slipping into their roles so easily it felt like they were just playing themselves re-enacting difficult parts of their own lives. If I had to pick, Driver gave the best performance, if only because he was given more space to do so. By the movie's mid-point, we definitely spend more time with Charlie than we do Nicole, and Driver makes use of every second. The argument is definitely the high point, for both of them, but Johansson also gets her own monologue to Laura Dern's Nora which is just as emotionally stirring, while Driver gets a subdued but heavy rendition of 'Being Alive' from the musical 'Company', as well as a heartbreaking scene at the end when their son Henry finds the love letter Nicole wrote about him.<br/><br/>As for complaints, in the lead-up to the argument, the movie was starting to lose me. I wasn't bored or finding it slow or dull, nor did I find any of the filmmaking aspects bad or hard to watch. But I found myself just getting so irrationally angry at the whole situation. From a purely factual standpoint, Charlie was the b*stard of the relationship. He was controlling and selfish, and a cheater on top of that. And yet putting Charlie front and centre for much of the movie just made me feel sorry for him. He was blindsided by the divorce, blindsided by Nora's ruthlessness, and blindsided by the financial cost it would have on him, all set on him by Nicole. It becomes very telling how semi-autobiographical this movie is of Baumbach's own divorce, acknowledging he was the cheater, but framing the story in such a way it lays most of the sympathy on his surrogate character, and the hardships Charlie has to go through at Nicole's behest. Putting Nicole behind the scenes for this portion of the movie, and essentially cutting out her side, really made her come off as the resentful b*tch putting Charlie through hell. The fact the movie makes a point that the blame can be laid on both sides almost makes this facet worse. If Nicole had just communicated her problems and desires more clearly and accurately, Charlie wouldn't have had to upend his life against his will and lose almost everything he earned. But I mean, as complaints go, I get the impression this was somewhat intentional on Baumbach's behalf. This was the point. He wants it to seem unfair, he wants it messy and his characters to both look terrible, he wants you angry at the system and how easily exploited it is at one party's loss.<br/><br/>I have no hands-on experience with divorce, but I found way too much of it relatable. We saw our sons in Henry, and we saw each other in Charlie and Nicole, but if nothing else, this movie just strengthened our relationship, showing us how bad things can get if we don't communicate properly and compromise for one another. But it's not a movie I could watch again. It's a hard pill to swallow, and as electrifying as both Driver and Johansson are, it's not enough to endure all that rage and misery again. Currently I'm sitting on a solid 8/10, but that argument scene was so...so...intense that I'm going to give it a whole point to itself. I give Marriage Story a 9/10. I'd advise grabbing a box of tissues before you begin."

"howard.schumann","8","3","6","8 December 2019"," A penetrating look at the spiraling effect of divorce American style
","Noah Baumbach's (""The Meyerowitz Stories"") Marriage Story is a penetrating look at the spiraling effect of divorce American style on those involved, one that radiates compassion for its beleaguered characters Nicole (Scarlett Johansson, ""Avengers: Endgame"") and Charlie (Adam Driver, ""BlacKkKlansman"") as they struggle to maintain their dignity through a dehumanizing process. If love means never having to say you're sorry, you are probably not living on planet Earth, though I'm sure other places may have their compensations. For Nicole and Charlie, however, just saying ""I'm sorry"" will not even reach the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>Nicole is a native of Los Angeles who left a budding movie career on the West Coast to move to New York with their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson, ""After the Wedding"") to star in the productions of her husband Charlie, an acclaimed theater director. In his role as Charlie, Driver is consistently brilliant in his portrayal of a man on the brink of despair, desperately trying to hold his life together in the face of fast changing circumstances, while Johansson has that uncommon quality that makes you care deeply about her. We first meet the two through film montages in which they discuss each other's virtues and idiosyncrasies, love letters asserting the qualities that they find endearing.<br/><br/>Nicole loves that Charlie is organized and dresses without embarrassing her. Charlie loves the way Nicole cuts his hair and makes tea and leaves it around the house. Charlie talks about his wife's devotion to playing with their son and how patient she is. To Nicole (who refuses to read hers out loud), Charlie never gets upset about the little things and is really a talented director. Unfortunately, we soon find out that the tributes were only written at the request of a marriage mediator as part of the couple's plans for divorce. Nicole refuses the request to read it aloud, however, and leaves the room in a fit of temper. This becomes more understandable when we learn that she has decided to take Henry with her to L.A. to shoot a TV pilot and pursue her movie ambitions.<br/><br/>Complicating the situation is the fact that Charlie has just received a MacArthur Fellowship and has agreed to live in New York. Further muddying the water is Charlie's affair with a woman at his theater company. Although Charlie believes Nicole plans to move back to New York after the shoot, she has other ideas and the thought of having to travel back and forth on a 3,000 mile trip to see his son does not sit well with Charlie. It seems to be resolved, however, when during his visit to California, he ends up being served divorce papers by Nicole's sister Cassie (Merritt Wever, ""Greenberg"") in one of the funniest scenes in a film in which humor is sparse but always welcome.<br/><br/>What starts out as an amicable separation between two people who treat each other with respect turns into a circus, however, when high-priced, aggressive, and uncaring lawyers, Laura Dern (""Star Wars: The Last Jedi""), Ray Liotta (""The Son of No One"") and Alan Alda (""Bridge of Spies"") come into the picture and the weather forecast becomes cloudy with a likelihood of rain. Fighting a custody battle for Henry, Dern is exceptional as Nicole's lawyer Nora Fanshaw, an outwardly warm and caring person, but underneath a saber-toothed cat who delivers a crusading speech about the different expectations for a woman. Charlie's second lawyer after the amiable, but too laid back, Bert Spitz (Alda) is Jay (Liotta in his best role since 2012's ""The Place Beyond the Pines"").<br/><br/>Jay is up front about the financial cost ($950 an hour) as well as the emotional cost in turning resolvable differences into attack weapons to corner and belittle his adversary. With some personal experience in the matter, Baumbach does his best not to show preference for either aggrieved party, but depicts the divorce process to be one that is filled with gladiator-like combat that only serves to draw the contesting parties further apart. While it is obvious that the charming, self-absorbed Charlie should have shown more awareness of Nicole's needs for a career of her own, it is equally the case that his wife's ability to communicate her needs was inadequate.<br/><br/>If ""love is a function of communication,"" Nicole and Charlie forgot it somewhere along the way. The film's emotional high point is the animated, accusatory conversation between husband and wife, perhaps better described as a shouting match. Though well-written, the verbal sparring becomes overwrought, though it mercifully ignores excessive use of the ""F"" and ""S"" words, so lazily prevalent in today's culture as a substitute for thoughtful dialogue and wit. While Marriage Story covers a lot of ground and is open to many interpretations, it all but stays away from any deep examination of the larger issues in a relationship such as commitment, responsibility, and communication, the cornerstones of any successful marriage.<br/><br/>Asked what the film is about, Baumbach says, ""It's many things; it's about how love is not always enough."" As author Werner Erhard put it, however, ""The truth is that that's all there is. And if you take the barriers out of the way, if you take the pretenses out of the way, if you take those things that you didn't take responsibility for in your life out of the way, what you have left is love,"" and adds, ""You don't have to be looking for love when it is where you come from."""

My wife and I watched it last night and, from the beginning, I could tell this was going to be syrupy, self-indulgent, molasses-slow movie that, I assume, drew from his background in theatre and film. The characters in the stock company, the neurotic sister who acted like a child, the child who acted like a brat, the mediator who plays a cartoon character, and the dialogue between the two lawyers that I could visualize being delivered at a table reading kept me at a distance. Then there was the loooooooooong monologue delivered by the lead actress that, as she shared it with her lawyer, seemed so artificial and contrived that I felt sorry for her that she had to read what I'd imagine the writer thought would be an epic presentation. Like the lawyers' dialogue, you could visualize the writer knocking it out and the actress trying to make it real. Instead, all you hear is a Hollywood actress reading a Hollywood director's lines and without the illusion of reality -- which carries all the way through the ten hours of this two-hour film -- it's difficult to get into it. How this got six Academy Award nominations is anyone's guess. Maybe it's an inside joke."

"Willie-12","9","5","14","2 December 2019"," One Of The Best
","I debated whether or not to even write anything about Marriage Story. It has touched so many people, and I don't want to come at this disrespectfully, because, in my life, I have not experienced divorce. My wife and I have been married happily for 20 years. My parents are about to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. And both my maternal and paternal grandparents were married for nearly 70 years and nearly 50 years respectively. So I guess I feel like I'm trespassing here. But I love movies. And I loved this one. And there are many things that are done well in this film. so here I go. First I should say that I have not been a huge fan of Noah Baumbach in the past. It is not like I have anything against directors who concentrate on smaller stories that seem as if they are actually pulled from the pages of real life. In fact, I love independent cinema when it is done well. Alexander Payne, Kenneth Lonergan, and Wes Anderson (although Anderson's films are more surreal sometimes) are some of my favorite directors. Again I think this movie is done well. The screenplay is very good. The acting is phenomenal, worthy of the award nominations I am sure are going to come to fruition. And the direction always seems sure of itself (save for a few scenes that go on longer than they should). But it's more than that. However, before I expand on that let me address some of the things that may make people a little hesitant about seeing Story. It's depressing. There is no getting around that. in fact, there is a point in Story where the depressing part of the film becomes so overwhelming, that it actually begins to almost physically hurt. it's predictable and it knows it. Almost from frame one, everyone who I saw it with knew exactly where it was going. And like in real life, there is no real silver lining. But it's not hopeless. And here is why, if people are hesitant to see this movie, they should ignore those feelings of hesitation. The son. As far as hope is concerned, the son in this film is the most hopeful part of the this couple's existence. He is the glue that keeps the lives of the characters together, even when divorce rips them apart. And as far as it being depressing...well...that's life . But I can say that every depressing experience that I have ever been a part of, and although divorce has not affected me, I have still had my fair share depressing moments, there's always a ray of hope somewhere. The lives of these people have that ray of hope as well. And because of that, there is a feeling that they, in the long run, will be alright. Another reason to see this movie has to do with the supporting characters. From the attorneys, to the extended families, almost everyone has someone who lifts them up when everything comes crashing down. One of my favorite songs is called ""Held,"" by Natalie Grant. In it, there is a line that I love. Grant clearly means it in a religious sense, but almost anyone can relate to it. It says,<br/><br/>This is what it means to be held,
how it feels when the sacred is torn from your life
and you survive.
This is what it is to be loved
and to know that the promise was
when everything fell we'd be held<br/><br/>Everyone has someone who, when life comes crashing down, will hold them. When Story was over, l felt like that would be true for the two main characters in the story. No matter what...no matter where they end up, they will always have the people in their lives to count on. And I think that even includes each other."

I was sorely mistaken. This is a faux emotionally wrought story with very lame situations and awful comedic interludes. Many situations appear extremely contrived while the lawyer characters (all three...Ray, Dern, Alan Alda) are pure caricatures. The dialogue is really bad... ""half of crazy is still crazy!"".

The big fight scene was absurd. The kid actor among the worst in history...Michelle in Full House circa 1992 did it better.<br/><br/>Why is this best picture worthy? Awful."

","Wow, this movie had so many possibilities to become a moving but relatable story. What a shame. I give it three stars due to the acting of Adam Driver. Although this wasn't his best performance, not even close, I do feel like he played a grounded role-a catalyst to the plot. However, the rest of the acting, in my opinion was simply atrocious. Scarlet Johansson had her moments within scenes where I felt she had shined but for the most part, I felt a disconnect to her character and never felt like her emotion successfully penetrated anyone. As for the rest of the cast, I was shocked at how corny and pretentious everyone was.<br/><br/>I don't know if this was caused from a faulty script or just poor acting entirely, but quite frankly, i was highly disappointed. The lawyer sought out by driver towards the beginning was the biggest cliche of the entire film. Tacky, rude, and extremely over the top. Don't even get me started on Julie Hagerty's performance.<br/><br/>What a let down for such a well selected cast. I found a more meaningful side story of a repaired marriage in Jon Favreau's Chef."

👏👏(2 applauses during film)
🏆TIFF Peoples Choice 1st Runner Up
🏆(strong Oscar potential for: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress - Scarlett Johansson, Best Actor - Adam Driver, Best Supporting Actress - Laura Dern, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing)<br/><br/>Marriage Story (Noah Baumbach) is a raw and deeply real portrayal of love, divorce, and family. It is a combination of a love story, screwball comedy, musical, and procedural drama. While the blend of styles at a point comes across as forced, the film as a whole is a brilliant work, telling a story rather than following the genre troupes many films fall into. This is a simple story originally executed.<br/><br/>Extremely character driven, the cast play their roles perfectly. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver lead the balanced portrayal of a divorcing couple. This film will impact viewers differently depending on many factors, especially their life stage and past experiences with relationships, marriage, and divorce. The film is so well balanced that one viewer will relate more to one character while the person beside them may be more drawn to the other. Regardless of which lead you relate to more, you are bound to be shaken by the deeply emotional performances of both.<br/><br/>A nod to the cast would be incomplete without a special mention for Laura Dern and Ray Liotta whose characters come to life in significant scenes of their own. The director shared at TIFF that at many times during filming he felt like he was watching the actor's movie rather than his and this truly shines through in their collective performance. Out of the many films we saw in Toronto over two weeks, Marriage Story likely has the best odds for this year's Oscar wins."

","Noah Baumbach's (The Squid & the Whale/Greenberg) current Oscar bait, airing on Netflix, stars Adam Driver & Scarlet Johansson as a couple in the throes of divorce. He is a theater director in New York, she is an actress & California transplant, who had a hit film back in the day but now performs in a play her beau is mounting for the stage. Something has happened & we never get a definitive cause as to the genesis of their breakup but when civility starts to crumble (they're hoping to negotiate the divorce on their own for peace of mind & their young son) but when accusations & resentments begin to surface, lawyers are engaged (she has Laura Dern in her corner while he gets Alan Alda & Ray Liotta). What follows is a modern update of Kramer Vs. Kramer (Best Picture winner 40 years ago) in which words do strike blows (their final verbal brush-up is more potent & devastating than any cinematic gunfight witnessed in some time). Baumbach, as always is a master of character & situation, as he has always mined the humor found in the most debase of scenarios. Who knows if the director's real life break-up w/actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (she is a celebrated actress from the West Coast) inspired the proceedings here but one hopes a lot of the emotional carnage on display is pure supposition. Also starring Merritt Weaver (as ScarJo's sister), Julie Hagerty (nice to see her again, this time playing the mother who doesn't favor sides) & Wallace Shawn (""Inconceivable!"") playing an actor in Driver's troupe."

","Marriage Story is a great example of pacing and emotional levity in film. I mean, there is so much that it's being said about Adam Driver's and Scarlet Johansson's performances, as they both deliver poignant and heart wrenching depictions of what is like to be a complex and often contradictory human being, it is nonetheless astonishing the virtuosso manner in wich Noah Baumbach picks the key moments in a divorce and lets us know how hard it is to keeo things friendly and loving in the midst of a system that makes every decision feel that much definitive and cruel. Every character is well written and I think this might be the best work that Baumbach hast put out to this date. Not only that, but this might be one of the best dramas with Divorce as its main topic right there along Kramer vs Kramer."
"hecklerandjokmm","7","3","7","8 December 2019"," Two unlikeable people and their unlikeable kid get a divorce
","In short Marriage has been destroyed by Divorce courts its the destroyer of Worlds but hey it's fashionable trendy loco and you wonder why there are incels and big pharma is rich by selling loads of anti-anxiety meds to kids from broken homes and parents have them to. Kramer Vs Kramer 2: the squeakquel revenge of the fallen judgement day etc. The father is the playwright, director stage company head honcho dude and the mother is the failed movie actor star of the plays. They both want big careers but have a kid it's one of those movies well done in areas. The lovey dovey actor stuff in this is both funny and cringe maybe that's the point. They are after all special. Man why were all the characters so unlikeable even the kid was a mothered little you know what, however he came off like the selfish parents that made him that way getting everything he wants. I looked at reviews such as ""these people are privileged and white"" which is racist in many ways, so black and brown people can't be privileged and successful huh?yeah I get what you are in trying to be woke you look worse. These people worked hard and have made money and get grants the mother may have well off parents most people in film do, black and brown people also get born into privilege and work to attain it so don't throw around that stale 2016 buzzword it's a trope in life now and a cliché and it shows a very narrow view of life. Also isn't Adam Driver Jewish? All people of any race can be privileged and narcissistic, go to Hollywood. I both liked and hated this film it made the father seem like a clichéd idiot that can't even pick what he wants to eat on a menu to the mother being an alcoholic that overtly mother's the son. It's almost 2d in its depiction of marriage and mothers and fathers yet they both want successful careers at the expense of their son yet they obviously love him. Then it would be 3d in its depiction of parents as they have honest reactions that they give each other as the divorce heats up that is fueled by divorce lawyers and the system which is very predatory and pantomimish, almost turning the parents and divorce into jerry springer characters. The feminist angle in this is funny that the female lawyer espoused that mothers are held up to a higher standard than father's seeing how I've seen women get away with smashing a glass in a man's throat with a ""just grow up"" from the judge as they do no time. No, women have no privelege. Most father's get screwed in divorce court to have a female lawyer spout out all that jargon about mother's being held to a higher standard almost had me fooled. Linda Hunt as the lawyer was good would rather of had a drama about Ray Liota Vs Linda Hunt divorce lawyer satire maybe? Make it happen Netflix. At times this movie had music that felt like it was in another movie like As good as it gets but this was not a happy ending it made no sense that your wife still loves you but she is dating someone else? I mean the reading of the letter left me thinking the mother actor was a lunatic that she would do things contrary to her beliefs then she confesses that she understands why her husband loved his work so much and neglected her because she has become him at the end lol making her look like a hypocrite. I think the Mother just wanted back on that carrousel that women go on in their 20s but without the reality. It also seemed as if the director took side mostly with the wife making her almost perfect and her problems were not focused on enough in the movie. neither of the characters had any self awareness either which is a writing problem these days. It had mixed messages to be honest you know when Patrick Bateman says,""this confession has meant nothing"" in American Psycho? I felt that at the end that the directors confession about marriage meant nothing. No new information was found. I felt jipped out of a profound message that it was just some pretentious socialites complaining about life whilst off screen some homeless guy fights a rat over a slice of pizza. They should have added that guy into the mix. Overrated but at least better than most Netflix movies which are shocking bland."

But I would sure feel uncomfortable if my divorce attorney took off her shoes and cuddled up with me on the couch in her office. Am I hiring you? Are we sisters? What's about to happen here? Creepy.<br/><br/>Even more creepy is the non-blinking, robotic evaluator Ms. Katz, who doesn't even have the correct address, doesn't smile, doesn't have a shred of engagement at all, and seems to be in this job solely for the check. She sits there staring at you. She stands there staring at you. She doesn't check out the whole apartment like, say, a child welfare worker would to see how you live or even if the entire place is presentable for a kid to live in. She tells us the obvious. ""New York is a long way from here."" Anyone knows that. It isn't for her to say. That whole scene with her annoyed me. Plus the thing with him and the knife made him look extra bad.

There is something about this authenticity he brings to his roles that is very special.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>After viewing it I am amazed how many men have reviewed the movie that say they sided with Charlie from the beginning and never swayed back and forth! I watched it with my man so luckily I know not all men have the same lack of emotional empathy. I as a woman swayed back and forth and tbh I say you must be a woman hating if you couldnt see it from her point of view ever.<br/><br/>Believe me, if it was a movie where the roles were reversed - and a male gave up all of his personality and life to cater to a woman's dreams for 10 years, where the man moved away from his family, was being critiqued by the woman in the way he acted, even had his hair and the woman asked the man to put whatever money he made into her dream - AND then she cheated on him AND then she expected him to praise her for all the men she didn't have sex with while she had the chance...you would NEVER see any man feel the least bit sorry for the woman being forced to then give up her dream and have to actually also adjust so the man could find himself and be close with his family where he came from.<br/><br/>So.

"gavanescu_raluca","10","0","0","18 January 2020"," The story we all know, but get to see from ouside and feel it deeply
","I usually fall asleep at movies, yes even at the cinema. There's something about those reassuring voices that makes me feel so safe, that I can take a nap. So, when once in a blue moon, a film keeps me interested all the way till the end, without reaching for the fast forward button, or yawning because ""oh the plot holes - oh the inconsistency etc."" I know I've found something special. This movie, this experience, had me pressing ""pause"" from time to time because it was too much, in the best way possible.
Yes, it has the whole boy/girl meets girl/boy (or whatever you fancy) formula, but it's not some random person meeting another and then breaking-up over a bunch of lemons or tiny stupidity, because we just want to see them fight, because we're drawn to drama and conflict while eating popcorn. No, these two had very good and real reasons for each step of their relationship. And, oh, boy, if you were ever in one of the roles: child of divorce, the one that thinks he/she is kind but actually is selfish, the one that acts like a victim - always blaming others of their misfortune AND choices, or just an overall mess, not figuring where to go next - regardless of age or career - this, THIS will hit you, this will open your eyes, will make you huff and puff occasionally. I started arguing with the screen at certain points.
So, of course, watch it. There's no right or wrong moment when to do is, like, you'll see, even if you try to take sides, you just can't. Because humanity means not being just one thing, means being the good and the bad guy at the same time. It means we have no idea what we're doing and no matter how much you try, someone will get hurt. This is a movie/story about two good people in a bad situation.
On the acting side: I think this is the dream. To act so good it feels 100% natural, yet, it's all mastery and control and well placed emotion. This story is good on it's own, but these people make it LIFE on screen. Hat tip to the supporting characters as well: everyone was so well placed, it never felt fake.
It's great that my first review is about this beauty, that, if you really let it, will shake you, nicely and delicately, to your very core. And you'll appreciate more the ones that love you and the ones you love."

Scarlett J has done her best to make herself as appealing as a non living object and it's Adam Driver who drives the plot when it actually works. Special mention to that one ""KNIFE"" scene which is the funniest I've laughed in a while. And special mention to the first 40 minutes that has no audio pauses and the ceaseless and pointless blabbering that hurts the mind/ears. Also, the kid is a spoilt annoyance and has too much screen time."

","The movie looks good from the perspective of ""drama"", until you look through the scenario and the decisions the main characters made during the whole movie.<br/><br/>1. We (the audience) haven't seen that Nicole actually discussed what makes her unhappy with her husband (Chris) or anyhow tried to solve her own life with him, but acted only behind his back ruining the family.<br/><br/>2. Every lawyer wants earn big using unhappy family as their 'successful' portfolio, and no layer would advise such a Nicole to simply talk to her husband and tell him what she feels before attacking taking everything he have earned. The layer was the only one character in the movie who played on the family, basically destroying it, and of course, got a nice profit.<br/><br/>3. I would understand Nicole's unhappy live with her husband if he hadn't care about her, but he basically made her a Star. She reached her dream, and only then decided to divorce him when she doesn't need him anymore.<br/><br/>4. During the whole movie we see how Chris was pushed. Is he such a bad man? He cheated, but this wasn't the main point the movie was trying to emphasize. Should we (the women) now divorce every time the men don't listen to us, to what we want without any explanation?<br/><br/>5. I have been waiting for a moment when they finally discuss their problems together. All they shouted was not about what they DID and want to GET from each other (except Chris's cheated), but how they ARE bad for each other. The movie teaches well how to break any relationships and at the same time it says - ""So we shouldn't even try to listen to each other.""<br/><br/>The moral part of the movie stays pathetic. The family was ruined because Nicole managed to tell her problem only to the lawyer. Yes, she's got what she wanted, but was she happy after? It didn't seem so in the end.<br/><br/>I'm scared to see that people consider this movie as something ""wonderful"". It teaches us to do stupid stuff without thinking that it may hurt someone we love"

","With all the critics raving & such a stellar cast, I thought ""how could it go wrong?"" But go wrong, it did. I gave up after an hour, most of which, saw Nicole in tears. The pacing is off - odd & disjointed. This film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a comedy or drama, so there are scenes of one or the other, slipping ungracefully into the next. The parents are borderline abusive towards their son, who is used here as a prop whom they can haggle over. The farcical scene leading towards Charles being served was cringe-inducing and overly long (since when does an old lady leap into the arms of her daughter's husband? Yes, I know wine was involved but everyone in the room acted like it was Tuesday). If Nicole stopped mid-way through explaining her story to her attorney to exclaim about how yummy the refreshments were one more time, I was going to throw something at the screen. Stop it, just stop it. Only crazy people act like that. Nicole is bratty, whiny and a couple sandwiches short of a picnic. Charlie is hang dog, wooden, stoic and largely unpleasant. I don't want to spend 5 minutes with these people let alone 2 hours! The only thing I can think of that would explain why film critics are raving is the cast of luminaries & the self-referential Hollywood/TV production sub plot. Critics eat that stuff up (see La La Land & Once Upon a Time...).

When the closing credits came on the screen we were almost speechless at how uneventful the movie was.

While the acting is great by both Adam Driver and Johanssen, the bickering becomes overbearingly long-winded - as if a fun guest had over-stayed their welcome by making their host listen to the same joke and the only difference being how they lead into the joke... In the end, I feel the only things great are snippets of the two leads performance, and almost all the scenes with Alda, Liotta, and Dern, made me wanting more.<br/><br/>This could have been a great bittersweet comedy about being in love while you cannot even like each other enough to break bread without fighting over small things like how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste. I can only blame the script and the director for this oversight. While the improv singing and end scene allowed Adam Driver to shine, this would have been a better story for Woody Allen or Whit Stillman to tell... in fact, probably Rob Reiner also would have made this better than the overrated flick it is.<br/><br/>As to Best Actress performances for 2019, I'd say this one holds no candle at all compared to Renee zellweger in JUDY (2019), but I digress..."

I watched the film due to it's overwhelming good reviews, and I often like Adam Driver's work.<br/><br/>This film was not for me. With all the Oscar buzz for the actors, the characters didn't seem real, relatable, or sympathetic to me; they seemed to be unlikeable stereotypes or caricatures, and the acting came across to me as acting. I wasn't rooting for anyone, but rather felt annoyed with them.<br/><br/>Yes, our legal system is largely a corrupt, money-making sham with unscrupulous lawyers working the system and financially taking advantage of their vulnerable clients. Seeing the dark mockery of this horrible system in this film didn't teach me anything, make me feel good, or entertain me, but did leave me wishing for my time back.<br/><br/>This felt like a failed attempt to emulate the tone of a Woody Allen film. I thought Alan Alda hit those notes the best; his short time onscreen was the best part of the film for me. There were also some funny lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>I could not help but contrast this film to Kramer Vs.

"jrinvest","5","3","8","3 March 2020"," Should be called ""Divorce Story""
","This movie is well acted, but marred by a couple of glaring inconsistencies. The storyline is about a woman who left LA because her acting career was going nowhere, moved to New York with her husband, became the main attraction in the theater her husband created, had a child with him at their home in New York, and then decides after eight or 10 years that she wants something else.<br/><br/>The ""something else"" is to divorce her husband, move to LA with her son, and pursue a career in television.<br/><br/>We watch as the husband has to cope with having the rug pulled out from under him and his life thrown in a blender, to mix metaphors. We see the all too frequent spectacle of divorcing parents, who initially claim that they have their children's best interests at heart, ending up hiring the most cutthroat divorce lawyers they can find.<br/><br/>One glaring inconsistency, as another reviewer pointed out, is that no actual lawyers were consulted on this script. Divorce lawyers call witnesses to get the facts on record, they don't argue cases themselves in front of the Family Court judge. Further, under the existing laws, the divorce would have taken place in New York, not California, but that would have meant no movie.<br/><br/>The other glaring inconsistency is the wife, who wanted out, appearing to exhibit some feelings of remorse or shame (in front of her husband) at what she has initiated. I know a number of divorce lawyers, and they have all told me straight out that they have never seen this happen with any woman who has filed for divorce.<br/><br/>My final complaint about the film is the young actor who plays the son. His height and weight make him appear to be eight to ten years old. However, he can't read AT ALL in the first half of the movie, and in the final scene (after he's been living with his mother and her new boyfriend in LA for a while), he is reading at a level you would expect of five-year-olds. I found this jarring, given that there is no mention of him having mild retardation, dyslexia, or any other learning disabilities."

","A well written drama dealing with divorce in 2019 is overdue. Kramer vs Kramer first showed divorce from a man's point of view. Then there was the memorable dark comedy / horror story The War of the Roses. Now we have this superb movie. So many good points. It excellently covers the toll on the parties of the financial and legal negotiations. Excellent array of lawyers played by Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. Despite their best intentions initially this divorce was bound to be a messy one with adultery, custody financial issues and geography all coming into play. From the beginning it's sad to know the little things that are going to be used against each other eventually.<br/><br/>We get a whole range of the emotional turmoil from some ironically funny moments to the big quarrel between the pair which is quite devastating. Surprisingly the child seems the least scathed in the battle.<br/><br/>Scarlett does a good job of acting genuinely sad. You feel for her. Adam Driver gives a tour de force performance. His strong personality works in this movie and his emotions on screen are so accessible to the audience.<br/><br/>A must watch. Be prepared to be left sad but enlightened."

This movie, as a drama, is made for feminists. Only feminists will be happy with this movie's ending. They will scream: ""Yes!! Take that men!"" And I guess that's why this movie has such a high rating, because this is a win for them. It's what they always say: ""Men gotta learn this lesson"". But for us, common people with the right values, this movie has a bad moral, it does not promote equality and family values. It promotes sadness and bad education. It teaches us that is okay to spoil our kids as long as it makes us feel better. It teaches us that even after having kids, it's okay for us to feel more important than our kids. This movie promotes division. And I know, many people will feel relieved that we, as a society, are normalizing the act of divorce, but I don't think we should be doing that. Anyway, about the acting, globally is good, But Scarlett just tries too much. It's not natural, it seems too forced. But woke 2019 will give her the Oscar, I'm sure.

","Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson looks like they have reached the end of the line in the marriage department.

What remains important is access to their son and the semi-amicable break-up gets ugly when it gets litigious.<br/><br/>Marriage Story is a high gloss soap opera in the tradition of Kramer versus Kramer featuring fine performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansen as the marital combatants. The split is not due to unbridled hatred for each other but lack of communication in which there is more frustration than rage. Writer director Noah Bombach's real villains in the piece are the down and dirty lawyers (played with relish by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta) and the divorce laws that can bankrupt both financially and morally a family.<br/><br/>Driver and Johansen display an excellent discordant chemistry with each other amid sterile settings that Baumbach applies some subtle incidentals to but the argumentation eventually grows repetitive with some moments contrived, others rushed and sloppy such as the one in which Charlie is being served.

","I had high hopes for this film after all the wild acclaim, but for me, it didn't live up to the hype. Yes, the acting by Scarlett and Adam was excellent. And I loved Adam's character's poignant and unexpected nightclub performance of the Sondheim song. Although a modest attempt was made to show two well-intentioned, but humanly flawed, parents dissolving their marriage while trying to keep things stable for the son they both love fiercely, the scales tip heavily toward making the wife into the ""bad guy"" (albeit with some redeeming hug-and-haircut empathy) and showing the husband as the occasionally foul-mouthed and ill-tempered one who really got the shaft. Notwithstanding any parallels to the screenwriter/director's real-life divorce, the film comes off as a husband's attempt to be oh-so-sorry for the mess in everyone's lives that he thinks started when his wife left him. It's as if his feelings of loss, loneliness, anger, and downright inconvenience are all her fault for just not understanding who he is (or how important his job is) and who he thought they were as a couple. As she asserts herself as a person separate from him and his goals for himself (and her), she becomes the film's antagonist. How unfortunate that this marriage story fails to recognize, as most people do, that when a marriage ends (and neither one is seriously mentally ill), there are multiple factors at play involving both parties. Placing the blame heavily on one over the other, with no substantial character change by the film's end, does little to enlighten us on the subject."

","Kramer vs Kramer set the standard way back in 1979 for divorce films.

Where it falls down, is in its contrived approach. This is most obvious in the awkward performances, that I would mostly describe, as heavily scripted and wooden.<br/><br/>Worse still, in my opinion it depicts contemporary US males in a less than flattering light as inconstant,incompetent and weak. I feel its a deeply unfair representation that fails to acknowledge the contribution and pressures placed on men, in modern society.<br/><br/>I'll confess to not finishing this one.

Then they try to resolve their differences at an all-party lawyer and client meeting, and it is clear to the husband that his lawyer (the always brilliant Alan Alda) isn't tough enough and he is going to have to spend untold thousands of dollars to fight his wife with a tougher lawyer because his wife is spending untold thousands of dollars to fight with him. (Neither has any money or property to speak of, so where all the money is coming from is baffling, but maybe this gets explained later.) So after this utter shambles of a meeting, the husband tells his wife that he is going to get his hair cut and she offers to cut his hair, and we jump to a ""sensitive"" hair-cutting scene to show...well, what a thoroughly nauseating wimp this guy is. It was at this point that I abandoned the whole thing as unwatchable. Whatever ""real life"" is like, it ain't like that. (Maybe this guy takes the scissors and stabs her with them, I don't know...and I certainly don't approve.).

They know each other so well and yet they're acting so surprised about not understanding each other fundamentally. It just doesn't ring true.

"abcdefgg","10","3","9","7 December 2019"," Masterpiece
","Can you make, in this day and age, a movie about a man and a woman and nothing else? Can you present the old battle between Los Angeles and New York in a new light and a have a 'neurotic' auteur male protagonist with his blonde muse appear fresh, more than 40 years after Woody Allen (and his master, Bergman)?
Can you drawn out for well more than two hours what in the end is just a dramatic comedy (the only flaw I would ascribe to an otherwise unmitigated triumph) and not only get away with it but pull from under your hat a career defining masterpiece not just for you but for your two leading actors (hell, three if we count Ray Liotta, and I'm gonna! I'd consider even Alan Alda to have been blessed by this movie if his career wasn't already legendary, although, besides Horace and Pete, this may be his only work really worthy of notice in the last 20 years)?
Well, turns out if your name is Baumbach you can do whatever the hell you want, and then some!
I've long appreciated this underknown master crafter of movies, although his last collaboration with Ben Stiller (and adam driver, who i only got to like in this movie!) left me somewhat cold. But it appears that since he took the Netflix way, UNLIKE some better known big shot director, he is regaling us with his best work since The squid and the whale, well into his fifties (I imagine...).
Aside from a couple of 'musical' numbers that seemed a concession to his stars and aggravated the already vexing screen time, the only other small blemish I could find in an otherwise perfect script would be that, despite a very conscious effort to present a very balanced, UN-kramer like scenario, in which both the man and the woman are very good parents and essentially good people who only want the best for each other, but still, against their better judgement, end up making each other miserable, the movie still seems to me to favor the woman in the end, if only slightly (55-45 let's say).
That may also be the reason why Scarlett Johansson is generally considered to have given the best performance, even though it seems to me the most dramatic scenes were given to Driver. That may also have to do with something cognitivists call the frame problem: while Adam Driver has almost esclusively appeared in artsy dramas, Johansson can be considered a somewhat bogged down version of the very character she plays, an actress known for a commercial movie in which she shows her boobs.
Funnily enough, the only nude the real Scarlett ever did was in an artsy scandinavian film that nobody saw (aside from the salient ten seconds...), but aside from that she may have given the best actorial proof in her career just because she never challenged herself all that much, not because she suddenly channeled Liv Ullman like many seem to think.
Driver, on the other hand, doesn't do here anything he hadn't already done in the past, beside being likable (no small feat for him! kudos to Baumbach once more).
All the rest of the cast is in a state of grace as well, from Laura Dern to the already mentioned Ray Liotta and Alan Alda as the combative lawyers of the protagonists. I may have chosen famous names for other roles as well, namely Nicole's mother and sister, instead of casting Wallace Shawn in a pretty forgettable and useless character."
"NomadicTool","5","2","5","13 May 2020"," Didn't get it
","Like everyone else who saw this movie, I watched it because of the great reviews it received, and the attention it got at The Academy Awards.
I want somebody to explain this movie to me, because I didn't get it. You had two immature, self-absorbed narcissists getting a divorce. Why? Because Nicole was being smothered in New York, and really wanted to move back to LA and be a star again? And?
The thing that I couldn't get over is the whole high-priced divorce lawyer thing. Why? It was far from a messy divorce, so why not just get a mediator? And when Charlie writes out a check to Alan Alda for $25K and then fires him for the $950 an hour lawyer? What?
The movie was predictable and unoriginal. The Halloween scenes. He has one costume picked out, and so does she. He takes him trick-or-treating AFTER she does. Did you notice how crappy the candy was. lol.
The blow-up fight and the tears. Who cares? Neither Charlie nor Nicole were likable. My favorite character was the women who observed them eating dinner. She may have been awkward, but at least she was likable, and normal.
This played like a Lifetime movie, not a major award winning picture.
As others have said, I liked this movie better when it was called Kramer vs. Kramer."
"q-02121-71714","9","2","5","12 April 2020"," marriage and love
","Happy marriages are similar, unhappy marriages have their own misfortunes. The story line of the film is based on the emotional crisis of the male and female masters, who once envied other people and turned against each other after the grinding of marriage, and met each other in the war.<br/><br/>In Marriage Story, the heroine was an actress and star with a good future before her marriage. She fell in love with Charlie for only two seconds. Charlie married Nicole in her prime and had a lovely son. In the eyes of others, a pair of natural people have to go to divorce because of their different directions of work, a New York-based, eager to return to their hometown of Los Angeles, coupled with differences in the concept of life.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the quarrel between men and women, the pinnacle of the intensification of marital contradictions. When once the closest lover is at loggerheads, the killing power is devastating, because you know the pain of all my soft ribs. Our faces are red, our mouths are not chosen, and we quickly and quickly pick up the words that can stab each other the most, and when we lose our minds to attack our loved ones, we lose our loved ones at the same time.<br/><br/>The Story of Marriage is not only about the collapse of a period of love, but about how to maintain yourself in the besieged city of love marriage, how to live in harmony with our partners, and how to maintain their dignity and dignity. Love is easy to get along with, love when you see all the advantages, get along with exposed shortcomings, learn to self-cognitive analysis, learn to live in harmony with others."

The movie tends to get a bit annoying when the lawers come in. And it makes you take the husband's side, even though that was not the movie's intention, as the wife, even though you can understand her motives (hurt, betrayed, being a mother and not a partner in their relationship), she takes it too far. The pace was all over the place too."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","17 February 2020"," Strong performances in this overall good movie
","The title ""Marriage Story"" is a bit misleading in my opinion for this 135-minute movie from 2019, because there is a lot more focus on divorce here. But first things first: The writer and director is Noah Baumbach and he has really made many films in the past that weren't seen by too many, but received critical acclaim. So it was certainly only a matter of time until he also gets his big breakthrough in Hollywood and if you have the likes of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver on board (yep he is also one of the biggest stars now, not only because of Star Wars), then it is bound to happen unless you really mess up the script. But Baumbach is too reliable for this. He has worked with Greta Gerwig, his significant other, a lot in the past, so it is kinda interesting that his female lead here (Johansson) got no less than two Academy Award nominations this year, one for this film and the other for Gerwig's newest movie. For the latter, her chances were probably better to win, but in the end she lost both, but really two nominations in one year are really a big achievement and I am sure she is happy with that. I know I am because she should have been nominated a long time ago and it seems perhaps that maybe the Academy wanted to make up for omitting her on a regular basis. Adam Driver scored his second Oscar nomination and this is also deserving. He played his part very well and was the reason why sometimes the movie reminded me a bit of Kramer vs. Kramer. You could say it is the 2000s take on a similar subject. Driver did not win the Oscar either, but this was basically only because Phoenix was steamrolling his competition. AD was still considered the only one who could potentially cause an upset for Best Lead Actor. There are many other nominations here, such as Best Motion Picture, but the only win went to Laura Dern for playing a divorce lawyer. Oh well, I cannot say she won me over with her performance here. I mean she was alright, but honestly I feel that the nomination is already too much. This win is as underwhelming as the winner for Supporting Actress last year. Also Dern clearly profited from the fact that she was the only divorce lawyer to Johansson's character (funnily Johansson was maybe the only threat to Dern with her portrayal in Jojo Rabbit), while Driver's character had two and these were played by Alan Alda and Ray Liotta. Two pretty different lawyers. Especially Alda would have been nice to get in.<br/><br/>Okay, I already said that I really liked the two lead performances here. They did not only have nice chemistry, but also the ways they brought these characters to life were really entertaining and insightful to watch. The film starts with something positive really that could also be taken from a happy marriage. We hear the two tell us what they appreciate most in their partner. Sadly, reality bites immediately when we find out they are telling this to somebody who is gonna support them with their divorce, but is still not the negative end because Johansson's character's reaction there takes things to a new low. I mean the atmosphere, not quality-wise obviously. And still, these notes about each other play a big role because they are referenced at the very end again in a really touching manner as Driver's character reads to his son what his ex wrote about him and I can see why these final words bring tears to his eyes. This was maybe the only moment when I was tempted to give this film 4 stars out of 5, but I really must admit that I did not like this one here as much as Frances Ha for example and that one received a 4/5 rating from me. Also telling that Baumbach did not cast Gerwig here, for she is really busy focusing on directing now and making her own movies. Okay, but back to this one here. Unfortunately, there were also moments I did not like too much. I thought the singing part with Driver's character added almost nothing for me very close to the end. Or when Dern's character makes a pretty bizarre speech that even involves Jesus. Please don't tell me this was supposed to encourage females and their emancipation. And a third example, although it was not as weak as the previous two for me, would be the big fight. Now this is definitely among the most memorable parts this film has to offer and I liked most of it, but when it really escalates I am not sure I was so fond of it all, perhaps only because I quite like the characters, but probably it was just too much for me and I could think of a couple ways how it could have been written better, maybe more subtle. But the weak (some of it subjective) here is not half as frequent as the strong. The final sequence that also include the notes I mentioned earlier is really good and we see how Johansson's character has moved on (and Driver's partially as well) and they found a solution that works for them as well as their son. But I also noted that Johansson's character's mother in this scene did not have a strong connection with Driver's character anymore, but instead she was joking around with her daughter's new boyfriend, which also felt a bit sad because it shows how time changes everything and the two were so close before that. Okay, I could have done without the reference that the female protagonist is now a successful filmmaker herself, but it's okay. Another thing I did not like too much was that actually Johansson's character went to all those different lawyers to also make sure her husband can't get one of them and that I found a bit despicable honestly and I did not like it because it's okay if the lawyers go up against each other, but this seemed like a really malicious move by her.<br/><br/>Like I already said, it is true the two are still married in the movie, but it really feels way more about their (upcoming) divorce. Real harmony is only there at the beginning with this voice-over sequence that tells us a lot about these characters and it was cute how they were pretty different with regard to so many things, but they both hate losing at Monopoly. There is another little fun reference later on about how their son still sucks at it. They seem to be so competitive there. And parents, please play with your children. Really play, I mean. So the entire film is basically about the conflicts between the two as they are heading towards new chapters in their lives. There is this escalation scene and we will never know if Driver's character is correct in telling her that she just searches for something to be unhappy with and that she will never be happy with a guy. We don't know how her new relationship is going to unfold. But even if they initially intended to manage the break-up and divorce in good spirit, it is not working out. Many dark things come to light. Be it the pills (I wondered they weren't mentioned later on by Liotta's character), the alcohol (how she is stumbling down the stairs) or the hacking and on the other side be it the seatbelt, the amount of time he spends with his son, be it his cheating or how she talks about that he never really saw her as an individual human being, but just as a part of himself. This reference is actually even more present on other occasions than in the courtroom. The boy you can also see on the photo, but while it is always a lot about him, also when we don't see him, especially then actually, there is major focus on the two parents instead and the son does not get too much screen time. The exception is the lengthy sequence when the (rather shy) female assessor comes to his home and basically all goes wrong there that could go wrong, most of all obviously how he cuts himself accidentally and falls to the ground when she is gone. We don't find out what happened exactly afterwards. He lost a lot of blood apparently. Maybe the boy called an ambulance or maybe he managed to get up himself and take care of the wound. This long sequence, as entertaining as it was, surprised me a little bit though because Driver's character seemed to be the one who is better structured from the couple, so I definitely did not expect it to turn out like this. Instead I thought that he could easily deal with the situation and really make it work and impress her. But it became obvious that the little chance he had was gone completely now and that he would see his son less frequently in the future. Much less. Still there are some slightly happy references towards the end of the film: For example, Johansson's character still does not want to hurt her ex and she does not want 55% instead of 50%. She does not want to humiliate the one she loved. Maybe still loves, just differently. And the second shot at happiness is that Driver's character now lives really close and can take care of his son more frequently and it won't be complicated anymore because he lives so far away. Overall, with the exception of those parts I already mentioned that I did not like from a subjective perspective, I think this was a really well-written film and the screenplay comes in second after the two lead performances in terms of what I consider the best aspects of this movie. It is definitely worth seeing, especially for couples I believe. Probably not for couples who are about to break up, but instead for those who still love each other dearly and won't let things go as far as they do here when it escalates in terms of one character screaming how he wishes the other was dead and the other comparing her man to his violent father before that. Hurtful. Next when they compare each other to all the family members, it felt so bizarre really. I'd like to close on a high note and mention something I fancied, which would be just a minor moment at the end and again when we have Driver's character read what his ex-wife thought about him, there is a brief reference about his family background and he omits a sentence there because he does not want his son confronted with this kind of malice. Here you have great attention to detail, something Baumbach always brings to the table."

","I just finished the film and I am blown away, and I also can't seem to stop crying. The portrayal of a couple who still have love and affection for each other but can't be together any longer was brilliant and accurate. It made me feel emotions I have suppressed for a long time. Coming from parents who divorced but still loved each other was a very confusing thing for me to understand. I didn't understand why my mom still called my dad ""honey"" or why she still cut his hair when it got too long. This movie truly made me understand my parents better, and truthfully, I don't think I can say a movie has ever affected me as much as this one. The acting was superb; Adam Driver depicting a man who realizes he messed up and is left to navigate life alone is just heartbreaking. Even though we know he messed up, you cannot help but feel gutted watching him at his lowest. I can't say enough about this movie. I will recommended it to everyone I know."

"Missyrocks","7","2","5","21 December 2019"," Well-acted but meh otherwise
","I give it a 5 for the movie but the acting makes me go to 7. This is not Kramer v Kramer for a new generation. In terms of family drama, it's not Ordinary People either. By far. Driver is deservedly the talk of the film for an amazing performance, and indeed, everyone does fine work. But, for me, I didn't like either of them. They're both selfish, self-indulgent, narcissists who chose the right profession for that personality. ScarJo is very good, but a raving B. Toward the middle, we get some perspective to supposedly justify a little of her anger and why she's tired of suppressing what she wants for him, but not so much. I judged her as a mother breaking up a family when she was not in a marriage that needed to end with people who loved each other.<br/><br/>***(SPOILERISH) *** It was infuriating to have him forced into paying for bicoastal living, associated travel costs, pulling a kid out of school, making a father commute like that cross country to spend time with his kid plus try to work, , the money wasted on legal fees- all for what? A good mother would have saved that money for her child's education and not squander it. We never got to see why therapy didn't work for them, did he reject giving her the spotlight for a while to allow her to feel more fulfilled? It seemed like it should've been doable. That's what made it harder to watch- her anger was not justifiable in my judgment and breaking up her family didn't seem justifiable. Moreover, her character ticks off every misogynistic stereotype of a woman- a shrew, malcontent, raging raving and impossible to make happy. I know there are those who will say she felt more fulfilled so that was worth it, near her looney family, but I think she's someone who 2 years later would be unhappy again in CA, just as she was before she met him. One of those who will always be dissatisfied. So it's hard to watch a movie, a real downer of one at that, about people who aren't that likable, although he was more sympathetic than she. Again, Ordinary People, Kramer, Terms of Endearment to name a few, all have people you care about and someone sympathetic to root for. Great performances all around here, though."

You would want to pick sides, but you won't be able to. That's the beauty of this movie. Unlike Kramer vs Kramer, where you clearly are rooting for Ted, or in A Separation, where you empathise with what Simin is going through, Marriage Story will leave you pondering about the reality of the separation.<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlett deserve Oscar nods for their performances, and I believe Noah deserves an Oscar for the screenplay.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Noah's work, but this is his masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's a movie made for mature audience.

I don't have a problem watching the same story told in a different way but this wasn't even that. This was the same story told in the same way just with different actors. Basically unhappy marriage. Husband cheats. Marriage explodes. The sticking point is who gets the kid. The one interesting take was the nature of motherhood vs the nature of fatherhood. How a father can act like a complete creep and no one blinks an eye but a mother has to be perfect or she will lose everything. Still this probably only for the married."

I learned many years ago that if there is no passion at the beginning of a relationship there will certainly be none at the end.<br/><br/>I must say after the court case this picked up somewhat where they all said things they didn't mean and then regreted it but it was so forcefully melodramatic I laughed out loud. My favourite bit was the domestic ""observation"" it was inspired.<br/><br/>The over sentimental mush ending was quite absurd after what had gone before.<br/><br/>The luvvies may think this is good but I found it tiresome.

","Reviewing is a subjective pursuit. I come to this film having originally considered watching it as a less than 'have to see' opinion, having read the story. It being in Netflix meant I didn't have to go up the road 75 metres, if it comes to the local.
It has fine acting, but the story is uninteresting. That is a personal opinion. OTOH, it is hard to believe two seemingly smart people would get themselves into the situation portrayed.
Baumbach has a reputation, no doubt about that, from a brief survey of his work. But, not my scene.

Acts like the cool mom to get the child in her side, hires the best lawyer, makes sure she sees other good lawyers so Charlie can't hire them, makes Charlie spend all his grant money and makes him pay 30% of her lawyer fees?! I was so angry at the horrible character which is Nicole and then I realized how many women play that role in a divorce. I've seen it and it's so furious the law favors the ""mom"" so much! All she does is whine about her life, her own mother prefers Charlie over her. I hated her character and the worst is how Charlie eventually lost his battle and had to give up his career and move to LA? Whist Nicole pretended to be a good wife. Charlie saved Nicole form her boring life and when he got successful she wasn't happy? If the roles were reversed Charlie would've looked like such a male chauvinist husband but some how Nicole just looks like the victim. Hated the story made me so mad!!!!

","This was an enjoyable movie, particularly if you like relationship dramas of wealthy people. And they are wealthy, although the film goes through great pains-and artifice-to distance itself from the clichés trappings of upper middle class life (so prevalent in 1980s Woody Allen movies) The production design is very pared down, as if the characters are so creative that they have no time for nice things, unlike those vulgar Wall Street people Anyway, good, emotional stories are in short supply in the movies these days, so ""welcome"" Marriage Story. But make no mistake about it, Marriage Story is very mechanical from the start. It announces its intentions immediately with Scarlett Johannson lit like Bibi Andersson in an Ingmar Bergman movie pose: this is going to be a story about motivations and emotional drivers with lots of fighting and tears-even male tears (!) Driver and Johansen are well suited physically. His performance outshines hers because he is the superior actor. She never quite escapes into her role and is clearly the movie star doing serious. When she acts, the words are flung back onto the page. The difference Is most pronounced during their epic argument which never really takes off emotionally. It all seems like a paint by numbers. In the annals of Breakup Porn, Kramer versus Kramer still wins. It has a lot more authenticity and heart and ½ dozen memorable scenes. But again, I did like Marriage Story. The supporting cast was marvelous, really too many to name. I fully expect a Supporting Actor nomination for Laura Dern and maybe even Alan Alda. He is a great reminder of how many wonderful octogenarian actors there are out there. Speaking of Oscars, I don't know about the leads. Perhaps it will be Adam Driver, who with his big odd face and imposing height, really is the next best hope for actors."

"ferni-tierni","8","1","2","25 April 2020"," A nuanced cautionary tale about the effects of selfishness or lack of empathy in relationships.
","A marriage story is an allegory of many of the things that can go wrong in the process of a divorce, when the two people involved are attempting to find a peaceful and communicative family system. At the onset the protagonists, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), Nicole Barber (Scarlet Johannson), were selecting a really sensible option by opting out from getting lawyers and not be bombarded by all the legal liabilities of getting lawyers and going to court, but their naiveté demonstrated them that life is not that simple when two people want to start a new life and share responsibilities and, most importantly, a child.<br/><br/>Adam Driver displays a clear ability to play a character that is authentic, rational, taciturn, rigid, but yet friendly and emotionally available. I believed in his character, despite exuding deficits at showing emotion in key scenes of the movie. He is the stereotypical character that thinks before he speaks. Scarlet Johannson plays a more emotional, passionate, impulsive, and confused character that is afflicted by her partner's selfishness. She married at a really young age and had no time to explore her needs and wants and ultimately existed in the shadow of her husband. The movie was a perfect opportunity to experience both Adam Driver's and Scarlet Johannson's range, histrionics, chemistry, depth in persona, but I think both of them fell short on what they could have delivered in the movie. The scenes of high emotionalism were not arousing simply by their performance but needed forced cinematographic inclusions to be able to amplify our sensibilities.<br/><br/>I have a bit of a gripe with the title. The movie unwittingly implies that marriages are like what is shown in the movie without being accurate about its depiction. It is more consistent to call the movie a divorce story rather than a marriage story, but I assume the narrative wanted to make a statement about the qualia of marriage in the twenty first century.<br/><br/>A marriage story is not in any level a bad movie, but it had so much to be able to reach Excellency. The characters are multi-dimensional. We get a cross-referenced perspective of each protagonist that adds so much to the movie. It is not only a story of these people damaging and hating each other. We see how much they care despite all the disagreements and difficulties. The gestures shown by both add to the tenderness and beauty of their relationship. This care is maybe what could have been dealt also in a more conceptual way and less in heavy handed scenes that seemed disappointing, but it is nonetheless a complex and nuanced cautionary tale about the effects of selfishness or lack of empathy in relationships."

","I think this was a very well made movie with great actors, the only hing is that the storyline itself is really boring. I get that it's supposed to be realistic and everything but in the end I thought, well is this going to be the climax but then it just ended like that. I thought Nicole was a b.... in this movie, she's manipulating her son to the point where he gets a 'treat' when he's capable of spending a day at his dad's like ""Phew I know it's so awful to be with him have a treat."" Adam Driver did an amazing job, he really fits the role. Charlie is a big guy but he's so kind-hearted. He wants the best for his son while not hurting Nicoles feelings. I really didn't know who would end up with the custody of the child. Although Charlie was trying so hard Nicole had such a good lawyer that she probably would've won. I think what made this movie not boring is the cinematography. I loved some of the shots so much. Let's take the shot were they were both in the train while each being on a separate end with the pole in the middle separating them. They did so good with shooting the scenes. I loved that some shots lasted up to 5 minutes which only made it more realistic. So I wouldn't watch it again for the storyline. But I would watch it again for the cinematography and scenes in general."

","There have been many films over the tears that have covered the end of a marriage and divorce. Kramer vs Kramer is probably the most famous one but this subject has been covered many times. A Marriage Story presents it in a very sober and matter a fact way. It is presented in a very real way. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie, a couple with a son that live in New York. Charlie is a theater writer and director. She is an actress that works with Charlie's theater company. When she was younger, Nicole was in a movie that gave her a little notoriety. She lived in LA but when she met Charlie she went to New York. They have decided to separate. They agree to go through a mediator to not involve lawyers but in the mediator's office he asks them to read the good things that they feel for each other out loud. Nicole refuses. She is going to take her son and go to LA to work on a TV pilot. Charlie is aware and agrees with the idea that she and his son would be back not fully realizing the marriage is over. Nicole is living with her mother in LA. Nicole goes to a lawyer in LA and is going to serve Charlie with divorce papers as soon as he comes to visit their son Henry. Nicole can't serve him the papers so she asks her sister Cassie to do it. This film is certainly a drama but their are many funny scenes. Charlie gets to Nicole's mother's house and comes in as if nothing is wrong. He gets along with Nicole's family very well, they love him too. He seems blindsided with the divorce papers. He thought that the move to LA would be temporary and Nicole would come back. Not the case. Charlie feels that they can work the divorce between them without lawyers. Things have changes. The film has alot to say about how people that still even love each other become enemies when they divorce. The most simple things become legal battles with each side's lawyers trying to make each of the former couple look like horrible people. While sucking them dry financially. Nicole's lawyer is Nora played very well by Laura Dern. She is very nice but a very good, brutally effective divorce lawyer. Charlie first hires a lawyer named Bert played by Alan Alda. He is an old style, lawyer, wanting to maje the divorce as painless as possible. He is not strong enough to tangle with Nora so Charlie hires Hay played by Ray Liotta, who us more of an aggressive lawyer for court. There is not much running time spent in the court room scenes bit it is clear that both Nora and Charlie are horrified at their lawyer's tactics at making each them look like horrible people. The maddening thing about this relationship is that it is obvious that these 2 people care very deeply about each other. The relationship is portrayed as being mostly respectful but of coursethere are many problems. As a viewer I asked myself many times why didn't this couple try to work it out? There is a scene that they try to gave a conversation without the lawyers but all of the legal fighting brings out the pent up anger in both of them and they have a horrible fight. Ultimately, things get worked out and both move on. The film doesn't necessarily sude with either of them which is good. The film to me explores the fine line there is between love and hatred in marriage. It's obvious that Nora and Charlie care about each other, but that is not the only thing that could keep them together. The film is hopeful in the way that it portrays to parents that both love their son ho through what must be a horrific process. Divorce.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

"danthebruv","9","1","2","15 April 2020"," Moving and Delicate
","I was really moved by this film. The soundtrack by Randy Newman really evokes a feeling of nostalgia and memories which really help bring out the tears during the movie, much like his soundtracks to the Toy Story films. And the tracks really compliment each scene, I noticed especially during the ending, which is where I finally cried. This is also thanks to an incredible performance from Adam Driver who really gives it his all here and despite his character not being a perfect person, you really do genuinely care about him and during some of the later scenes, his emotions start to properly come out and that's when I began to cry. The cinematography is also extremely well done and there are a lot of shots that symbolically divide the two leads and it subconsciously gives a feeling of sadness. It's shot very still and unmoving in a good way and it helps set the tone and pace of the film, which is slow yet extremely emotionally impactful, especially in the latter areas of the movie. It's just a really solid, unique and compassionate look into the real struggles of a divorce and throughout the whole film, you feel bad for both sides of the party for different reasons. And when the movie comes to a close and the two finalise the split while still maintaining a stable family life with their son, you feel a sense of melancholy relief. The letter reading scene at the end was honestly in my top 10 movie scenes of the year it was that damn touching. I think this was the right film for me to watch especially with me feeling really down recently, and it's a flick with lots of heart, solid writing, incredible acting, a stellar soundtrack and a real punch to the heart. If you're interested, watch it. It's truly one of the best of last year. Well done Noah Baumbach."

","At the end, tears welled up in their eyes, a long, messy, sometimes ugly, sometimes tender american-style divorce, a breakup that was not always easy to make decent, but one that left them with enough love for each other and their children. Although the American system is complex and sometimes ridiculous (such as sending an observer to observe the confusion and awkwardness of how fathers and children get along), it is generally quite human, unable to live together and still the closest family member, unable to refuse to acknowledge the existing feelings. On the part of the actors, johansson's performance has been very stylized, can not walk out of her early fire of that set; And Adam is the treasure actor. He's so good. It's all about him. A lot of brilliant acting sequences, a lot of golden lines, a lot of funny moments, a sad and funny film, a new reflection on modern couples: ""the virgin Mary gave birth to Jesus when she was still a virgin."

","I heard about this film during Awards Season, made by Netflix it was receiving many nominations in various categories at the big award ceremonies, and it was rated well, so I looked forward to it. Basically, Charlie Barber (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Adam Driver) is a successful theatre director in New York City, and his wife Nicole (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson), a former teen film actress, is the star of the company's latest production. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a Mediator (Robert Smigel), who suggests that they both write down what they like about each another. But Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud and they decide to abandon marriage counselling. Nicole is offered a starring role in a TV pilot in Los Angeles, so she decides to leave the theatre company and live temporarily in West Hollywood with her mother, taking the couple's young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) with her. Charlie decides to stay in New York, as the play will be eventually moving to Broadway. Despite the couple agreeing to split the divorce settlement amicably and have no lawyers, Nicole hires family lawyer Nora Fanshaw (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Laura Dern). Nicole tells Nora the full story of her relationship with Charlie, the gradual feelings of neglect by him and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also mentions that she thinks Charlie cheated and slept with the stage manager of the theatre company. Charlie travels to Los Angeles to visit his family, revealing that he has won a MacArthur Fellowship grant, but Nicole serves him divorce papers. Charlie meets with brash and expensive lawyer Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) who urges him to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring him. Nora calls Charlie and urges him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry. Charlie returns to Los Angeles and hires empathetic and retired family lawyer Bert Spitz (Alan Alda), who goes for a more civil and calm approach. On Bert's advice, Charlie rents an apartment in Los Angeles to be closer to his family and strengthen his custody case. Charles wishes to avoid going to court, so Bert arranges a meeting with Nora and Nicole. Nora argues that Charlie had little respect for Nicole's wishes to move back to Los Angeles and that Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than flying back and forth. Bert privately advises Charlie to leave his New York residency, but a frustrated Charlie refuses and decides to fire him. Using his MacArthur Fellowship grant money, Charlie hires Jay. The case moves to court, where Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients and attempt to portray the other party in a negative way. Nora highlights Charlie's past infidelity and emotional distance, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits as alcoholism and mentions hacking into Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Charlie and Nicole remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed with the constant moving. The couple are embittered with the legal process and decide to meet in private to talk things through. The discussion starts calmly and friendly, but eventually becomes a bitter argument. Nicole claims he has truly become selfish, and Charlie punches the wall and says he wishes that she would die. He then breaks down in shame and apologises; Nicole comforts him. Expert evaluator Nancy Katz (Martha Kelly) monitors a night in with Charlie and Henry, during which Charlie accidentally cuts himself. Soon after, the couple agree to reach an equal agreement to finalise the divorce, although Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole, against her wishes. One year later, Charlie play has been a success in Broadway, while Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an Emmy Award for directing an episode of her show. Charlie informs Nicole that he will be living in Los Angeles full-time to be closer to Henry. Later, he discovers Henry reading Nicole's list of things she likes about Charlie she wrote down during counselling. Henry asks Charlie to read it aloud to him, he does so, becoming emotional as Nicole watches from afar. That evening, following a Halloween party, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home even though it is her night with him. As Charlie walks out to his car carrying a sleeping Henry, he Nicole smile at each other, and they part ways once more. Also starring Wallace Shawn as Frank. Johansson and Driver both give exceptional performances as the separating couple who try to remain friendly through a difficult process, their highlight is the argument, it is good to see Liotta and Alda appear as well, but Dern does almost steal the show in most of her scenes, including a magnificent monologue moment. The title is probably deliberately misleading, as it is about a marriage ending, it gets ugly when the lawyers get involved and the custody battle gets heated, it is well written, with moving and emotional moments, but a little room for humour also, it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Music (Original Score) for Randy Newman, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Casting, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","Personally, I have been putting off seeing the critically acclaimed film Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach. People have been telling me to watch this film since December and I didn't really want to watch a film about a divorce around the happy holiday season. Also, I have heard from multiple sources that this film deserves all the awards that it had been nominated for and I was worried that the film wouldn't exceed my high expectations thanks to my sources. They were right, for the most part. I personally did like the film, but I can not say that I would want to watch it again.
Marriage Story is about a married couple that would like to get a divorce. Charlie (Adam Driver) wants to stay in New York and his soon to be ex-wife, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) would like to move and stay in Los Angeles, they also have a child which just makes things much more difficult. This film accurately represents both sides of a divorce and in the end, you really do find yourself rooting for both sides. I personally think the scene where Charlie (Adam Driver) reads Nicoles (Scarlett Johansson) letter is really impactful to show how much they really loved each other and also why they needed to get a divorce. In the scene, their son Henry is trying to read the letter to his dad and he reads, ""He rarely gets defeated, which I feel like I always do."" Nicole writes this letter to read to Charlie in the beginning of the movie, but she never does because she says she didn't like what she wrote.
Yes, the film is a good film, but I don't think I would personally see it again. The whole movie is about a divorce and it's almost two and a half hours long. In my opinion, this is not the usual type of movie I would find myself picking out to watch on a Saturday night. At some parts of the movie, it did drag on a bit, but I feel the acting of Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern, and many more definitely made up for the longevity of the movie. Noah Baumbach also directed the film, The Squid and the Whale, which is also a divorce story but not nearly as long. There are other movies that are also over two hours long, like Forrest Gump. When watching Forrest Gump, you don't feel like the movie is being dragged out to continue making the same point throughout the entire movie. I think, if maybe the movie wasn't over two hours long, more viewers would be interested.
In the film, Noah Baumbach uses many different techniques especially in point of view and costume/makeup. Throughout the movie, I feel the viewers can really understand how each character is feeling about the entire situation. We get an inside view of how Charlies friends are feeling, how Nicole's mother is feeling, and even how their child is feeling. I feel we really get everyone's perspective towards the divorce and separation. I also feel like we really get to see how the characters are feeling by what color their outfit is in some scenes. For example, in a scene where Charlie gets frustrated and angry, he is clearly wearing red to show the emotion that Baumbach wanted to portray.
I can not say the film, Marriage Story, was my favorite. But I can say that I appreciate the acting and the idea of the film. I just feel it could have been much better if it was just a bit shorter. But, I can say that if you have been through a divorce or you have seen one first hand, you may find this film to be more emotional for you. As for me, I can not say that it is my favorite nor will I be watching it again."
"bankofmarquis","7","1","2","19 January 2020"," Well acted scenes do not pull together
","Noah Baumbach is one of those filmmakers that is highly regarded in the ""Art House"" community for his semi-autobiographical humanistic films. These are domestic dramas heavy on dialogue - the type of film that ""A-List"" Actors swarm to perform in for the acting challenges it brings. His latest, MARRIAGE STORY, is no exception as it follows the dissolution of a marriage and the struggles of the 2 main players involved. The husband and wife are written realistically (according to Baumbach) with moments of pathos and moments of repulsion thrown in at equal measure.<br/><br/>So, naturally, Baumbach (THE SQUID AND THE WHALE) was able to draw 2 of the better performers working in film today to play the leads - Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver - and they deliver the goods (along with Laura Dern) - all 3 were deserved Oscar nominees - and the performances of ALL of the actors on screen are worth watching.<br/><br/>But...that's about all this film has going for it. For I found the first hour and a half of this film tedious with (at times) preposterous dialogue that looked good on paper - and was enthusiastically performed - but wrang (at least to me) as unrealistic. Consequently, this film is filled with well acted scenes that I kept saying to myself - ""that was a well acted scene and that was an interesting choice that that actor made in that scene"", but I found that these disparate scenes in this part of the film did not hold together as a movie. It seemed to me a series of acting class scenes and not a film.<br/><br/>And, for that, I blame Writer/Director Baumbach. This film, purportedly, parallels his divorce from actress Jennifer Jason Leigh (HATEFUL 8) and it shows. It's a little too ""on the nose"" and ""inside baseball"" for my tastes. The dialogue, at times, was ""too cute"" and the pacing was deliberate - which is a nice way of saying ""slow"".<br/><br/>What saves this film is the performances. Johannson dominates the first part of this film and she brings her ""A"" game, bringing a strength and awakening purpose to her character that will have you rooting for her - at the beginning. The first half of the film (for the most part) is Johannson's film and is what gives her her Oscar nomination (she won't win), but she deserves the nomination.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is also Oscar nominated for her role as Johannson's Divorce Attorney. Bright, funny, articulate and a shark in the courtroom and boardroom, Dern's character was fascinating to watch onscreen. While I thought this performance was ""fine"" and I was ""okay"" with it getting an Oscar nomination, I kept waiting for the ""Oscar scene"" for this supporting character - and about 2/3 of the way into the film this character had that moment - and Dern killed it. I would now say Dern is the deserved frontrunner for Best Supporting Actress (ironically, over Johansson who is ALSO nominated for Supporting Actress for JoJo Rabbit).<br/><br/>This scene propels the last 1/3 of this film into interesting territory - a place that this film had not gone to thus far. I was sucked into this last part and I think it is in no small reason due to the fact that this part of the film is driven (no pun intended) by Adam Driver's character. I've always found Driver to be a fascinating actor and while his character was not front and center much in the first part of the film, he commands center stage in the last part and I could not take my eyes off of his powerful performance. In a strong year of Best Acting performances, he shines and I would be happily surprised and satisfied if he won the Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Alan Alda, as usual, brings an interesting character to the screen as does Julie Hagerty (remember her from AIRPLANE?) as Scarlett's mother. The surprise to me was the strong play of Ray Liotta as one of Driver's lawyers - it is his best work in quite some time and shows he does have some acting chops. Finally, good ol' Wallace Shawn (the ""inconceivable"" Count Visini in PRINCESS BRIDE) was fun - and annoying - in his scenes.<br/><br/>So...if you want to see some good acting in scenes that I am sure will end up as good scenes in an acting class performed very strongly, then check out MARRIAGE STORY. Just make sure you are well rested. A fast-paced romp it is not.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B (for the strong performances)<br/><br/>7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","Do you want to hate Los Angeles? Then come here and do all of the clichÃ© things that tourists do such as walking down Sunset Boulevard, and go to Universal Studios. Hey, on the weekend, just switch states and check out Vegas!<br/><br/>Do you want to love Los Angeles? Go on a hike up through Will Rogers State Park and see a performance at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Stay in California for the weekend and spend it in Joshua Tree.<br/><br/>Another way to hate Los Angeles is to watch this film! I'm a native of LA; I've traveled the world and I live here again. I love my sprawling city, but this film made me want to leave forever and move to Manhattan.<br/><br/>Such typical east coast snobbery here, the shots of NY included the esoteric theater (or should I say theatre) company and the jazzy bar where the pretty girl you know is signing a tune... it was so romanticized and hence saccharin. The shots of LA were mostly of Adam Driver's character having a miserable time in a miserable apartment, surrounded by gritty mini malls. These places exist as part of the tapestry that makes LA diverse and interesting, and yet there is so much natural beauty too.<br/><br/>Geographical diatribe over, the film packs a powerful performance punch by Adam Driver. I did side and sympathize with him while interestingly my husband found the culpability rather balanced between the two main characters. Thumbs up."

","""Story of a Marriage"" is a difficult film to evaluate, since its core is to talk about the end of a marriage, the American-directed feature Noah Baumbarch is good but it didn't touch me, his sentimentality is strong, especially in the third act, but it is a contextual film, people who have experienced the same trauma will identify more and feel their pain, feeling and anguish at the top of their skin, which I was unable to feel.<br/><br/>As the name suggests, ""Story of a Marriage"" deals with the breakup of a relationship of an established couple and a child, the long brush outlines the reasons for the breakup but focuses on showing the consequences of a breakup, his drama sometimes escalating. too much, and its hatred and ramifications are strange in the very sense established and created by the film, but as already had, its conclusion is beautiful and poetic, a charming third act that concludes and circumvents its errors very effectively.<br/><br/>The direction is simple but has an exquisite use of the camera and framing, always highlighting the distance of the couple and opening up to monologues and views, which are always filled with great performances, the whole cast is fine, Adam Drive and Scarlett Johansson has phenomenal chemistry, and both actors are great in their roles.<br/><br/>""Marriage Story"" is a good movie, it deserves and will take some Oscar nominations, but again, it's a very contextual movie that needs a previous viewer experience, those who don't have that traumatic experience, will see the qualities of the movie but will not feel all your sentimentality.

"lordbaldrick","7","1","2","24 December 2019"," Excellent performance, but fail to relate on many levels
","Marriage Story is a good film but an overrated good film. It's at times great, but it doesn't work for me on many levels.<br/><br/>As someone who is going through a divorce myself, I just can't identify at all with Nicole. From the very beginning her grounds for divorce seems incredibly flimsy. Do a couple who are clearly still in love with each other decide to end it for the reasons given in the film? I can see why so many are labelling them as hipsters. Well... And Charlie at the end of the film wants to move to LA. Well... Are we supposed to sympathise?<br/><br/>As for the plot, there are just too many similarities to Synecdoche, New York. So the wife has decided to move to a far away place, and taking the child whom the husband fears he will never see. Then the husband is a theatre director who got a MacArthur grant, and is the love interest of a ""lesser"" female member of the theatre crew. And then a condescending female professional (lawyer / therapist) provides comedy relief. I mean, am I supposed to immerse myself in the plot when I am counting similarities of this plot with another plot?<br/><br/>And then there's more. So Nicole is an actress turned successful female director. How wonderful, guess who that reminds me of? I really hope Gerwig wouldn't mind getting written into a divorce drama while Baumbach is still with her. I am hoping Scarlett Johansson is not going to be the big screen witness to another director couple divorce (well she's technically not on big screen in Her but hey).<br/><br/>So you see, there are just too many elements stopping me emotionally investing in the characters. Critics love it for the in-jokes, maybe. But to be honest these in-jokes are just plain annoying and pointless.<br/><br/>I like films with a stage play feel when it's done right. Marriage Story has good rhythm and excellent performances but I feel the wit is missing. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson have both probably done their career best here. Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are both totally enjoyable. The intense dialogues and monologues are definitely great but they are just soooooo obviously vehicles for ""outstanding performance of a lead role in drama"".<br/><br/>To be honest, I doubt people will remember Marriage Story in 10 years. Maybe drama students will. As this film feels incredibly like a drama class exercise."
"zippytango","7","1","2","19 December 2019"," Could have done without the theater bits
","Marriage Story has a lot going for it including a great cast - with the smaller roles being the most fun - like Alan Alda - but (spoiler here) the dialogue in the scene where the couple each lose it and scream at each other came across to me as too contrived, and not even believable ""I wish you would die!"" considering that the actual circumstances of the dissolving relationship are pretty tame. Another minor criticism is that for me, the injection of two theatre songs from Stephen Sondheim were off. This is a film, not a play. The scenes work in the sense that the husband and wife playing them are a stage actress and a stage director in the story, fine, but they fall flat for me, perhaps underlining the difference between what is good on the stage and what is good on the screen. Theatre goers may love those scenes but they yanked me right out of the film. All in all, enjoyable but not nearly great."

"petereaston97","10","1","2","14 December 2019"," Beautiful
","I have to start off by saying, whilst I am not the biggest fan of Baumbach's work, I am a massive fan of this movie. The movie simply follows a young married couple who live in New York as they go through the hardships of divorce.<br/><br/>Marriage Story has moments to make you laugh, to make you cry, to make you angry. You feel the emotions as the characters feel their emotions, all while never siding with either character. You feel like the child of a divorce being dragged from one side to the other, not knowing who to sympathise with and who your allegiance is drawn towards. This of course comes down to Baumbach's trademark realistic dialogue, and the performances of Adam Driver and Scarlett Johanson - they are both wonderfully superb! As a viewer you feel like a fly on the wall in the midst of family engagements and situations you feel like you shouldn't be watching as Baumbach manages to frame such an intimate setting.<br/><br/>Do not go into this movie expecting screaming and shouting, with temperatures constantly flaring - no this movie is not like that, in fact it delivers the same punches in a more subtle, quiet, moving manner. However, do go into this movie prepared for the best movie of 2019, as that is exactly what it is."

","Despite the constant barrage of films that are meant to excite, bewilder and entertain, there will always be an appetite for those that feel gritty, real and make you use your brain. This is the case with 2019's Netflix drama 'Marriage Story.'<br/><br/>In typical Noah Baumbach fashion, there's a lot to unpack here. 'Marriage' looks at the unraveling relationship between two middle class Hollywood types (Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver) and how they deal with raising a son during a divorce. Unfortunately, this strikes very close to home for many, which is partly why it has found an audience. Unlike the personal dynamics at play here, the plot is relatively straightforward. Just like the flight path between New York and LA (and back) - a typical one for this industry - we alternate back-and-forth like a ping pong match, with Johansson and Driver trading barbs and trying to one up each other around every corner.<br/><br/>The real intention of 'Marriage' is to show off the acting capabilities of our leading and supporting cast. While Driver surprises, ScarJo comes off as forced and one-dimensional; the role of Nicole was written for someone who has much better range. And while Laura Dern dazzles as established divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, she could be accused of rehashing her portrayal of the similarly cutthroat Renata Klein.<br/><br/>'Marriage Story' is a long, downward spiral that may make you think, but it also leaves you feeling pretty depressed. Some argue that it's an amazing team performance that should be celebrated, but it's just not a fun watch. At all."

"fitz-15091","5","2","8","25 February 2020"," A Marriage Story (if marriage is a contract and not a covenant)
","The beginning of ""Marriage Story"" begins with a wholesome timelapse of the couple's daily lives narrated by one another reading a letter of adoration about their spouse. However, the film takes a jarring comedic twist when it's revealed to the viewer this is just the beginning of the couple's separation. This clever opening compelled me to believe the film would be more than promising, but the next two hours would only disappoint. ""Marriage Story"" is hardly about the ups and downs of a broken family, but rather, a spectacle of downs alone where the complexity of love and heartache aren't challenging each other.<br/><br/>For a couple that could within themselves choose to see the good in their partner despite all the reasons corroding their marriage, it's hard to believe they're the same couple for the remainder of the film. The pair, Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), are only ever able to overcome adversity scarcely when Nicole orders Charlie food and ties his shoe. This inability to rise above created very weak leads that coaxed distaste in the viewer for either one or both spouses. The two characters are overloaded with flaws that are grossly overlooked by their own judgement for the entire duration of the film, leaving them with only a single redeeming quality of wanting to do what's right (with not much motivation to do so). During their separation, neither experiences any genuine growth in their struggles outside of courtroom gain. Once the money and lawyers were out of the picture, the two are able to reconcile and be civil. Not because they worked on themselves, on the contrary, but because if they're not facing conflict that confronts their shortcomings, those shortcomings lie dormant until another issue arises. The film gives a false sense of growth, when in reality that growth was stumped by the characters' self-serving pride.<br/><br/>Despite being stagnant characters, Driver and Johansson have pivotal points of evoking emotion from the viewer, such as when the two have an argument in Charlie's new apartment and Charlie breaks down. Johanson plays a convincing mother and estranged wife and Driver truly embodies Charlie's emotions, making him seem more surreal, which made the film easier to digest. However, when Charlie sings ""Being Alive"" to seemingly vent his feelings in a format he best understands, it became less ingenuous. The longer the scene progressed, quickly it became more of a catalyst to fill the film's desire to be an artistic, Hollywood-esque film, such as La La Land. As for the divorce lawyers the film poked fun at, Alan Alda had by far one of the best deliveries in selling his role that outshined the more superficial portrayals by Laura Dern and Ray Liotta (which is largely due to their stifling characters).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film hints at children being used as pawns in the courtroom, yet the film only allows room for Nicole and Charlie's child to become a convenient chest piece. Their child lacks depth or development, other than a ""mommy's boy"" attachment that causes a petty disparity between himself and his father. While Charlie and Nicole are trying to convince the viewer that their son comes first, they simultaneously are pushing for their own agendas without regard for their child, leaving their son neglected by both the couple and the script writer. For a character who is supposed to be so important to the parents, the character is treated as Waitress #2, and made ironically irrelevant to the story as a whole. Inadvertently, the boy becomes an accessory for the sake of the plot. Unfortunately, the poor development of his character made him quite unlikable, alongside his parent counterparts. In Charlie and Nicole's child, you'll find only the remnants of an idea rather than an individual, resulting in an unmemorable character whose name no one remembers (it's Henry). In this boy I see so many missed opportunities to explore the confusing pain of feeling divided between two people you love and the misguided guilt of driving them apart. In the end, you'll discover two parents who seem to care deeply and sacrificially for a child who's nothing more than a puppet who wishes he can be a boy.<br/><br/>Overall, the story wasn't strong. The characters danced around each other and had terrible communication just as the plot did with the viewer. ""Marriage Story"" is a sensualization of divorce written from a Hollywood-skewed perspective of marriage."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","6","2","8","22 February 2020"," A wannabe Kramer vs. Kramer without the heart.
","Marriage Story (2019) isn't a movie about divorce so much as it is a movie about the east coast vs. the west coast. While I'll admit that there were some pretty good performances in this film (notably, Laura Dern was spectacular), there wasn't anything new here that other movies like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) hadn't covered. Additionally, it was a bit difficult to separate the two leads (Scarlett Johannsson and Adam Driver) from their other famous movie roles, which made it difficult to commit to the premise fully. Plus, movies like Marriage Story are just uncomfortable looks into lives in shambles that probably hit too close to home for some people.<br/><br/>It's weird how so many successful elements didn't come together cohesively for me. Randy Newman's score sounded great, but it made the film sound more like Toy Story (1995) than Marriage Story. Likewise, with the famous acting talent present: they had exemplary performances, but it didn't seem to gel with the movie as a whole. I will concede that the opening scenes where the characters narrate what they love about their partner felt almost eerily familiar to my own life and its quirks, but perhaps that's just being able to codify the male and female conditions.<br/><br/>If I were to pinpoint one of the biggest things wrong with Marriage Story, it's the awkward moments. Most of these scenes seem to go on too long (like Adam Driver singing) or play to laughs or pity that made me cringe more than produce the desired effect. Additionally, one of the most shocking scenes was an incident near the end that felt like it would have had some lasting impact on the plot but was never mentioned again (despite its dire circumstances). I'm not going to spoil what that scene is, but you'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>A wannabe Kramer vs. Kramer without the heart, I give Marriage Story 3.0 stars out of 5."

","This film just made me feel frustrated. I didn't like it, I didn't hate it. I just didn't get it. I felt like I wasn't the target audience even though I'm married and I have a young son so you'd think I'd be able to have some perspective. I could relate to some of the struggles, I could relate to some of the arguments. But mostly it just felt like a film written by a man, trying to make you feel sorry for the man.<br/><br/>And I did. I felt really sorry for Charlie! I wanted to see it from both sides but I don't think the writer really wanted that.
The speech by Laura Dern about the idea of a perfect father only being a recent thing rang incredibly true. And the film only perpetuates this.<br/><br/>The film starts off beautifully with a list about what they each love about each other. It seems like it should be an amicable divorce. Then suddenly this crazy divorce lawyer is involved, Nicole turns into an absolute cow and Charlie is completely blindsided. I just didn't buy it. Moral of the story, all women want to do is take your children and steal your money in the process. Feel sorry for the poor man, he only had a little affair (which felt completely brushed over!) and now look what this awful woman is doing to destroy his life. It just made me really angry.<br/><br/>Great acting, horrible story."

Dern and Liotta are two dimensional stereotypes that play on the hackneyed joke of ""we all hate lawyers."" I didn't care about any character.

Yet I found a one-dimensional law suit drama where a weak and egoistic Scarlett Johansson without personality ruins the life of an Adam Driver with a passion for his kid and the arts. The acting was fine but the writing was lazy. He is the only one who we really get to know, so she naturally comes across as a superficial evil coward. Their child is not really worth fighting over either. So many lost opportunities to make this movie worthwhile!<br/><br/>(And right now it scores even higher than the Irishman on IMDb ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„)"

"cesiraurzi","5","2","9","15 February 2020"," Mumblecore divorce story
","What makes us watch films? We want to be moved, scared, entertained, or simply engaged. At times we achieve catharsis, but in any case we always expect the filmmaker to have something new and interesting to say. Baumbach could have given us a new perspective on divorce or engaged us emotionally, especially given his personal experience, but he failed to dig deep enough.
The problem is that in trying to be somehow objective and presenting the story from both perspectives he fails to explore the inner workings of either character. We see what is happening to them but we cannot feel it. It's like listening to a guy you just met in a pub talking about his devastated love life. You can feel sorry for him, but after a while you just want to get back to your business. The most obvious comparison, Kramer vs Kramer was a bit of a melodrama, but it had something new to say, as it was questioning traditional parental roles. Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage gave us a precise dissection of the ego of its two protagonists and showed us new depths of human psyche. The war of the Roses was as far fetched as it was hilarious, but represented a cautionary tale for all those who do not choose to split up amicably. What did marriage story give us after two and a half long long hours?
We find out that divorcing is not pleasant and that divorce lawyers say nasty things.
The only reason we end up feeling sorry for the couple is that because of their expensive lawyers they are going broke. They are supposed to fight for their kid's custody, but we never really feel their love for the kid. We have to believe that they care because that's what's parents do, but from what I see I don't understand why adam driver simply didn't go back to his life in New York.
As per the acting, to me it looks like good but not outstanding improvisation. Adam driver could pull convincing facial expressions, but he seems to have lost his charm, while Scarlett Johansson tries so hard to deliver her monologues in an oscar worthy fashion but looks like she's acting all the time.
I really don't understand Hollywood's obsession with Baumbach and his partner Greta Gerwig. I find them so dull and boring.

Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver put all their effort into the roles of a separated husband and wife in a tense battle over their son. The movie's slow pace allows enough time to let the characters develop, and these are complex characters.<br/><br/>It might not be the greatest movie of all time, but it's an effective one, and I recommend it.

The guy can flat out act and Scarlett Johansson went to another level giving us an enthralling performance. Watching these two play off each other for two hours was a thing of cinematic beauty. Laura Dern's Oscar winning role was strong, as was Ray Liotta's lesser talked about turn as a lawyer.<br/><br/>Marriage Story will reel you in, churn you up and spit you back out.

I haven't heard of such divorce story in real life like ever, yet many say it's very realistic. Maybe it is realistic in USA, but in Europe it's not.

And Marriage Story was a far better movie to sit down and watch than Two Popes in my opinion.<br/><br/>The acting was just...phenomenal. Everyone in this movie acted their chops off in the most heartbreaking way they could. Henry's actor (Sorry, forgot his name) just made me depressed in a heartfelt way. He was the hardest to watch in every scene because I just hated to watch him favor his mom in front of his dad, be fought over like tug-a-war, and looking lonely when he was with his dad. I just couldn't... I simply just wanted to cry with his presence if you understand. I hated having Charlie just watching his relationship with his son fade. Adam Driver, like the kid, broke me. At the beginning I semi-sympathized with Scarlett Johansson's Nicole, but by the middle towards the end, the movie easily made me side with Charlie, even though he's no better.<br/><br/>I get that in divorces there's a bad side to each person that has to shine at some point. And at each point, I did come to hate both the leads because of actions they've done, but at the end, they're just humans. They made mistakes, and now one wants to move on understandably. But yet, for the one who wants cling onto a broken relationship and attempting to keep a legal fight going, I sympathized with him more because it was tough watching him hit rock bottom to fight for keeping some form of custody with his son, while simultaneously losing everything and his whole life just to maintain custody.<br/><br/>But Nicole also deserves to move on with her life without having Charlie's life consume hers.<br/><br/>It got ugly between both sides for sure, and this was hard to watch. But it was a very solid story that made all for a good film worth watching, with a great set of acting and direction.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be that but felt too repetitive and slow at times and some scenes felt out of place and random. The crossfading was just awkwardly edited to move on to other scene too. But those were my concerns.<br/><br/>In other words, a nice heartwrenchig tale. One for memory. Not perfect, but still not too forgettable.<br/><br/>Final rating 8.4/10"

","Marriage Story was easily my most anticipated film of the year and it met all of my expectations. Essentially every aspect of this was done perfectly. I don't think I've seen a film be this heartbreaking while also being pretty funny throughout. That alone probably makes this my favorite screenplay of the year.<br/><br/>The pacing in Marriage Story never seemed to drag throughout its runtime. The story feels so complete. It goes beyond what typical movies would go for, so the 2 hours feels full rather than bloated. Not to mention the fact that the characters, in true Baumbach form, actually feel real.<br/><br/>The acting was, of course, outstanding in this. While this isn't my favorite Scarlett Johansson performance, it's a pretty fantastic one at that. Both her & Adam Driver easily give some of the best performances of the year. Laura Dern, Ray Liotta & Alan Alda were great as well.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, Noah Baumbach isn't doing anything mind-blowing, but this movie never looks dull. It always looks beautiful, like a classic film in the making. The music from Randy Newman was also amazing.<br/><br/>I genuinely don't know how this could've been executed better.

"criti-cally","10","1","3","2 April 2020"," A Love Story About Falling Out Of Love {criti-cally reviews}
","The biggest problem with great movies like Marriage is writing a review about it. The movie is about a couple who due to some differences want to go through a divorce. The movie is a close examination of the process of divorce and how messy it can get, changing people along the way until things get back to normal.<br/><br/>Marriage Story movies through multiple genres. It starts of a light, romantic comedy movie. We get to know the intricate details and a personality overview in the first 5 minutes of the film as both characters introduce each other. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. As we progress the movie knocks you out with a single blow as it switches genres, very smoothly in to a distressing drama.<br/><br/>Nicole, a former teen film star, wants to move back to Los Angeles with the couple's eight-year-old son, but Charlie, an up-and-coming theatre director wants to remain in New York. What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. It wouldn't be a Baumbach movie without a man-child at the center of it. The filmmaker has spent his entire career profiling gifted men who are reluctant to grow up. In Marriage story, Driver plays the same - slightly immature, considerably self-involved, but also capable of decency and warmth. Baumbach's choice of letting Driver express himself fully as the lead role in the movie was a great decision. He is definitely the strongest of them all and delivers an Oscar worthy performance that is transformative, unseen and heartbreaking. It seems all the other actors are feeding off his energy and bringing their A-game to the movie. Scarlett. Johansen has never looked and acted better. From a caring mother, to a becoming a woman who won't let anything come in between her dreams now, Nicole's transformation couldn't have been portrayed better than anyone else. If Driver adds emotions to the movie with his heartbreaking performance, Johansen makes it move forward with her role as a women who still loves her husband, but wants different things for herself.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, we can clearly see a change in Charlie and Nicole's relationship and personality, having to deal with the divorce. Where there once was an intimate and almost wordless understanding of each other, there is now bitterness and resentment, egged on by an almost clinical legal process. The film's most heartbreaking scenes are the ones in which Nicole inadvertently calls Charlie 'honey' in the middle of the most vicious arguments; or when she decides his food order for him during a tense meeting with their lawyers. ""I will never stop loving him,"" she says in that opening voiceover. Which is true. Nicole had become into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. ""Love doesn't make sense"", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.<br/><br/>On of the special features of the film is that it manages to get it right that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not every time) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults. While Nicole turns very sour in the process of the divorce such as going against their joint agreement to not involve lawyers and hiring the most ruthless person in the business, Nora Fanshaw (played by Laura Dern in a scene-stealing performance, giving some specular and hard-hitting truths about gender inequality). Meanwhile, Charlie is not only forced to pay a portion of Nora's fees, but is made to settle for the kindly Bert (Alan Alda), the only person who seems to have an idea of the human toll separations can take on couples. There are moments when you do feel sorry for Charlie and feel Nicole is being too ruthless. But then, when you look from Nicole's perspective, Charlie did have a relation once outside of their marriage which he clarifies with a remarkable line, ""You shouldn't be upset that I ****** her, You should be upset that I had a laugh with her!"". The fault lies in both, some more than the other, which is which is hard to tell.<br/><br/>The most important thing the script gets right is the theme of divorce. The movie very closely examines and critics on the entire system and process of divorce, its impact on kids, on how it makes the couples waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want.<br/><br/>Baumbach emerges as true master of writing and directing in this movie. The script is very special and the little moments in the story develop the characters and reveal more about their nature. In a particular scene, Nicole commands her mother, who has an independent equation with Charlie, to not interact with him anymore. When he visits them in one scene, he knows exactly where the paper towels are, and which drawer the cutlery is in. Little moments such as this convey reams of information about the characters, whereas lesser filmmakers would've had to rely on pages of dialogue. In a particular scene of a courtroom battle With Charlie's new lawyer representing him after he fired Bert with Nora Fanshaw, we see both the characters just sitting quietly. It's like they weren't even mentioned in the script. It's the lawyers talking, delivering their dialogues and fighting it to, while both the characters are just quiet. But in the scene right before, they were fighting, and for the first time openly venting their anger out to each other. It was such a metaphorical moment that the protagonists, even though they seem calm and composed in the courtroom, have their inner turmoil's and anger and resentment towards each together which they are battling to and want to express.<br/><br/>Baumbach shoots pivotal moments in the film in long, unbroken takes, allowing life to just... unfold. There are no flashy cinematic techniques on display here, save for perhaps a couple of pointed visual metaphors like three bedroom doors closing on Charlie all at once. The actors are allowed to roam free; not at the mercy of traditional set-ups but with palpable confidence. They are fluid and the acting seems very natural. The characters seem very human, like someone you would know and real, feeling real emotions, which make you feel with them. The approach is almost like theatre. The set is a playground that Driver and Johansson can explore, as we watch, transfixed at the truth they are able to tap into, again and again and again. The camera doesn't confine them to tight spaces, but offers silent support as they amble in and out of rooms; as they walk through frames and stare directly into its depths. Baumbach makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his Director of Photography, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman composing a score that is completely apt and masterful!<br/><br/>Overall, Marriage Story is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score. This is one of those movies that will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. It is so authentic that watching it occasionally feels like eavesdropping on a couple in their most vulnerable moments. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. It is a love story about falling out of love which guarantees that no cheeks will be left dry."

","A bittersweet comedy about an marriage that is changing, but not ending. Actress, Nicole Barber (Scarlett Johansson) and husband and establish play director Charlie Barber (Adam Driver) work through a coast-to-coast divorce as Nicole pursues a Hollywood acting career. Marriage Story focuses on the struggle of changing dreams in life and in a marriage. Compromise is something not negotiable for this couple. The couple fights to find what is best for their son, Henry, as their lawyers fight to make Nicole and Charlie the enemy. Marriage Story, a Netflix original, gives the story of an established New York couple who works through marital problems in their own way.
The theme of this film is change. Change can come in many different forms and it can define someone's character by how they react to the world changing around them. In this film, Nicole and Charlie are going through a pretty serious divorce, a divorce that they did not see in their future. But, was necessary because according to Nicole, Charlie was a control freak of their marriage and never really listened to what Nicole wanted. There were many different factors that caused their divorce and the elements of the divorce causes some serious changes in this family of three. Change can be difficult for some, or a necessity for others, but how you react can often define who you are.
This film uses many techniques to make this film as great as it really is. The use of lighting and dialogue make this film. When in New York, the lighting of the film seems darker, giving that depressive East coast feel, while in California, everything is bright, representing new hope and happiness the sunshine gives. This is important because it shows the difference between the two cities and it also goes to Henry's emotions of his living situations. Henry was born in California, but grew up in New York. Once Nicole moved back out to California, Henry was happier, found more friends at school, and was around his cousins more than he was in New York. The lighting of these scenes help show Henry's happiness and how he thinks his life is better in California. Dialogue also helped created the emotion and intensity of the film. One scene that relied heavily on the use of good dialogue was the scene towards the end of the film where Nicole and Charlie were yelling at each other in Charlie's California apartment living room. They start off discussing what is best for Henry because during the divorce, they had moved away from the well-being of their child. This scene develops into a heated yelling match about all the things that they see wrong with each other and how their marriage did not work. Without the words said from both Charlie and Nicole, this scene would never have had the impact it did without the use of strong language and good use of dialogue. There were plenty of other film techniques used in this film, but lighting and dialogue were the most effective.
Marriage Story depicted a couple living the dream in New York until they were not anymore. Nicole and Charlie Barber were a successful, play producing couple, until Nicole wanted to change her career. Things went downhill when Charlie did not support her like she did for him all those year. This film was a story of change and how the characters responded to that change.

","First, the performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are absolutely brilliant. They perfectly capture how people feel when they're going through a divorce, which is one of toughest things anyone could go through. You can see the pain in Driver and Johansson""s eyes, and when that pain comes to the surface, their performances take your breath away.<br/><br/>Second, Noah Baumbach did a brilliant job directing this. What makes the direction so brilliant is how restrained it is. There's a lot of scenes where the characters are just talking and expressing their emotions, and this movie allows them to do that in the most natural way possible.<br/><br/>Third, the main thing I liked about this movie is that it doesn't shy away from how complicated the characters are. This movie doesn't take sides and it shows the strengths and flaws with both characters. It's a story about how relationships can bring out the best in us but also the worst as well."
"andrewroy-04316","8","1","3","8 December 2019"," Emotional and honest in its affecting character portrayals, Marriage Story is a wonderfully written and acted look into marriage and divorce
","Marriage Story is much more about the small actions that are indicative of character than big showy claims, and is so much more effective for it. Even as the story is about how a divorce happens, it's so emotionally charged because we grow to understand what their love was built on in the first place. Driver and Johansson are both absolutely exceptional, and I wouldn't mind at all if they won the two acting awards at the Oscars (especially if Nyong'o for Us and Pitt for Ad Astra don't get nominated, as it's looking). Johansson is particularly electric, showcasing her character's alternating anger and consideration. Baumbach's script is excellent, showing each character's side fairly and honestly, allowing us to empathize with both while never demonizing anyone. It's that honest, human heart of the movie that brings out the unexpectedly caring touches, like the shoe tie at the end, and the unexpected brutality, especially of one argument. It also makes plain the absurdity of the legal system, specifically in divorce, as it cost both of them boatloads of money while severely straining their relationship and not really getting either person what they wanted. In some ways, it feels like a faithful adaptation of a really well-written character driven contemporary fiction novel, where the characters are given space to be understood and where each interaction has such high emotional stakes. Extremely well made from start to finish, the ironically titled Marriage Story is intimate and deeply, honestly sad."

","Some questionable editing choices, none of the story was delivered visually, every single actor besides Adam Driver was boring as hell or is just a cartoonishly exaggerated archetype.

While then elites see this story as sad, but the 'new norm'. We commoners see a structural problem. We might ask who wrote these perverse laws that allow lawyers to make out like bandits while leaving their clients in debt and acrimonious. We even ask is the ScarJo character even had good reasons to want a divorce from a marriage that seems almost idyllic.<br/><br/>People in middle America tend to remain married and consider the best interests of their children and their family, its not always about me me me. People like the ScaJo character think they have something profound to give the world, more often than not, they don't.<br/><br/>The delusion of the elites was never more evident than the latest Academy Awards.

"gphgrm01","7","1","4","27 May 2020"," A decent movie, but from a male perspective, which decreases its appeal
","It is a decent movie, but its major flaw is that it still favors male perspective in the film - a husband who seems to be fighting for a custody over his son, while in reality he is simply fighting for his life not to change too much from what he got used to. Of course, its not admitted openly in the film, but if you watch it with a little bit of distance, you see it. The film would have been much better without a cheesy crying song that Driver sings in a bar at the end of the movie, complaining about his misfortune, and without pathetic reading of the long-forgotten sheet with his ""good sides"" put by his wife while they were still doing a marriage cancelling.<br/><br/>We have two people who irreversibly decided to divorce because it seems that both in terms of their private lives and professionally it works for both of them. The problem starts when (off course, like always in movies) the wife gets a famous female layer involved, who actually starts helping her put on the table what she actually wants, and not what her husband expects from her. The whole suspense is going about where the child will be based, NY (which suits the husband), or LA (which suits the wife). So a lot tears will be cried by Adam Driver just because Scarlet Johannson's character will insist on staying with a son in LA. This is obviously not a terrible decision because the kid loves LA, and the husband looks like a guy preoccupied by his work in NY anyway, and with no much patience for the kid, but the whole problem goes about the fact that this is something he did not expect: he believed that she would follow his ideas about the separation, and he is devastated when he discovers that she decided to push what is better for her.<br/><br/>The plot is subtly inviting us to sympathize with the husband, simply because he is a surprised party, he is someone who does not have good family network on his own, unlike his wife, someone who is not ready for change, etc, somebody who is pushed out as a secondary parent all of a sudden. On the other side, its clear that for 10 years he had it all on his side : a wife who adjusted her to him and to the role of homemaker, while he was the one in control. The film does leave us with a clear complaint about the fact that, as much as they are privileged in the marriage, men can be severely deprived of that privilege by the divorce. My problem with the movie is that its somehow, still invites the audience to judge this ""change of heart"" in the wife's decisions negatively. We still spend more time looking at Driver's shocked face just because he has to interrupt his directing job and pay lawyers, then the time we have an insight into what actually makes his wife wanting desperately to change her life. The point of criticism is still coming from the instance of white male patriarchy : like, white males complaining about why when they once form a family, it can't stay always the way they want. These are all the flaws of the movie, and with a little bit more work on the script and less ""crying"" over divorced male's tragedy, the film could have been really a masterpiece. But, now, its a kind of decent movie, but with already seen slippages."

Yet, in the occasions when we expect real acting, she is like this ""vulgar, rude, grotesque"" giant in the film, that disturbs you all the time somehow. She does not flow with the scenario, she cant develop a character, she cant show emotions..

The motives of the divorce feel totally faked and made up, the emotional turmoil of each party is unexplored (except in a few scenes), the focus is put instead on the legal matters, which feel casual and hollow. The worst part, however, was probably the kid, who acted anything but a normal school-going (6-7 year old?) kid. For instance he seemed to be completely ignorant of the fact that their parents were splitting up, he did not voice any concerns about it nor ask why this has to be so, he didn't understand he's father was hurt while lying on the kitchen floor, and he said that he liked the costume his mom bought better because it cost more... Seriously? In brief, the whole thing just felt fake."
"2001mmFilm","7","1","5","10 December 2019"," 'An Uninspired Marriage Story'
","'Marriage Story' delivers a very simple premise in a very simple way. Therefore, it can only be effective in its performances, particularly Adam Driver's. The story focuses on what divorce inflicts upon people who'd once loved each other, yet lesser movies like Billy Crystal's 'Forget Paris' have a more interesting narrative to go along with this focus, and are more colourful in their approach. I commend the film's setting of 2019, as fewer directors today opt to set their films in the contemporary time period. The reason those warm terms ""70's, 80's and 90's movies"" exist is because those films were actually SET in their contemporary setting. Sure, 2019 is much blander than the previous decades mentioned, but it would be nice to one day look back on the 2010's the same way we look back on the 80's for instance, in film. The overall colours and look of the film (aspect ratio, palette) are nicely adjusted, although the film itself would benefit from a few more establishing shots of New York City, again linking back to the idea of contemporary. Show the 'One World Trade Center' just like older movies showed the 'Twin Towers' for instance, staples of New York City during different eras.<br/><br/>I often got distracted by Scarlett Johansson's obvious 'Oscar Bait' performance, while Adam Driver is always more grounded and realistic. What an actor, honestly, especially in those closing scenes. Laura Dern I suppose is intentionally unlikeable as the lawyer, and the awesome Ray Liotta could've had a few more comedic scenes to improve his character. Perhaps as a man myself, I found myself sympathising more with Adam Driver's 'Charlie's' point of view. Essentially, 'Nicole' (Johansson) wants a more prosperous career as a director, but 'Charlie' thinks too much of himself (as a director) to bother to notice. Whenever love is conflated with career, especially with themes of envy or jealousy, it's hard to connect to 'Nicole's' story emotionally. You just get the feeling that 'Nicole' is selfish and 'Charlie' just wants (rather understandably) to KEEP things the way they were since marriage. I mean, it was HIS job. HE got her into it. She agreed to marry him. Give it a few years and then end it to pursue more? What about commitment?<br/><br/>Their child 'Henry' is an insufferable, annoying and exceedingly unlikeable character. I hope this wasn't intentional, and the major drive of the story is the mother and father trying to figure out what's best for him, fighting in court for him, etc. It's revealed that he's eight years old, yet he acts five in every scene he's in. Which eight year old can't read the word 'time'? I know I wasn't like this at eight years of age... And maybe kids are just getting stupider these days, but hey, I was only born in 2001. Maybe the writer and director of this film, Noah Baumbach, just doesn't understand children in general. What he's directed here, is an occasionally moving but ultimately uninspired film, whose story is lead solely on the shoulders of very good performances. It will do its duty in picking up a few accolades during Awards Season..."
"felix-bergman","6","1","6","16 February 2020"," Expertly acted, but to far from my life to hit home
","This movie is for sure one of the best when it comes to acting and it's not surprising it several of it's actors was nominated for Oscars for their performances. However the ""story"" is too far detatched from my own life for this to hit home. I've never been married (and as such never divorced either), I don't have any kids and most of my imidiate family are still in their first marriages, including my paretns and grandparents. Still I know several firends who's parents are divorced, as well as some of my firends and some coussins, so I'm not virgin to the subject. Still, while I'm sure they all had their problems that they had to deal with (hence the divorce), I don''t know anyone who dragged lawyers into it or had to fight battles over custody of the kids or alomony and the like. Outwardly it all seems pretty smooth. It's either ""Ok, we'll keep living close to eachother and as long as we are both clean and decent parents we split 50/50 whenever possible, and we each pay for the time the kid spends with us, not more, not less"", or it's ""We won't live close to eachother anymore, so let's decide one palce were the kids go to school and the other can see them on alternate weekends and longer periods over school breaks, in which case we'll work something out for how much the kids clothes and school material and toys etc. costs and split it"". Maybe it's a cultural thing, since I live in Sweden, or maybe american movies/tv-shows just like to focus on the worst aspects of humanity and extream bad cases of divorce, or maybe everyone who I know who has been through one was just lucky exceptions, but this whole paying 100's of 1000's of dollars to bring in lawyers to sit in a room shouting at each other, not giving room for any acctual conversation to happen seems so surreal and unneccessary that I just can't find this movie very appealing. The court room scenes was also my least favorite parts of Kramer vs. Kramer, but at least that movie was maily about a father and son bonding, which still made it an overall positive experience."
"TorontoFilmFan","6","1","6","9 February 2020"," Mediocre Marriage Story
","This is a pretty mediocre movie about a less than interesting divorce. As is often the case when the director is also the writer, this movie suffers from a weak script and a dearth of strong tweaking. For a film about marriage - or is it about divorce - Marriage Story has little to say and offers little insight into marriages or troubled relationships. Scenes play out as if it is fascinating for the director watching behind the camera, but for the audience many scenes just seem to go on too long, or peter out, or need to be pumped up. Surely the biggest problem with the movie is that the motivation for this particular 'drama' is unclear. Here we have a youngish couple with a child, both with careers in the same business, who seem to be at a crisis in their marriage. But how we got there and the magnitude of that crisis is unclear and remains vague throughout the film. We see one stab at counselling and then bang it's off to melodrama-movie-style-divorce. For all the naturalness that is attempted here the behaviour and situations these folks find themselves in - and their subsequent behaviours - seem quite fake and unreal. Again this problem is due to a contrived script. The child custody element of this story (shades of Kramer v.s. Kramer) also doesn't work very well because at the heart of it is an immature, spoiled, selfish, neurotic and irritating child who seriously needs a firm hand and a haircut. And whereas the actors seem game, the scenes with the child actor feel stiff and constrained. The adult actors do a great job from Ray Liotta and Laura Dern and Alan Alda as the lawyers to Adam Driver as the husband. But Marriage Story really belongs to Scarlett Johansson who yells, laughs, cries, wipes away tears and basically owns this movie what there is of it."
"rafis-kadir","5","1","6","8 February 2020"," A little bit too predictable
","Some spoilers alert...so beware.<br/><br/>I know it's not about having a twist at the end, with performances from almost all the cast being stellar who needs one. The directing is fantastic, love many of the scenes that were done a bit differently such as the carpark ticket scene. But somehow for this to be rated over on average as an 8 is a little high in my view.<br/><br/>The story is a little too predictable and the ending does not give you much satisfaction. It is littered with several liberals, let's say, propaganda which to me kind of takes away from the artistic side of the movie a little bit. But hey you can't watch a film these days without some political nuances or liberal or conservative propaganda being injected forcibly these days.<br/><br/>I love many sides of the movie but in the end it's just what you would expect from a drama about divorce with a kid stuck in the middle. It was quite a lot more focused on the wife's side of the story, making you think that there is a lesson to be learned intended to be for men more than for women. But there were moments when the film was trying to show the shortcomings of the wife too but did not go on bringing the balance required for this to be a complete story.<br/><br/>At the end part the ex-wife had found another man and the husband was made to look like the losing party by being single. The wife was nominated for an Emmy for her directing skills, so she is actually the one that is more talented than the husband, telling us all that she had the last laugh and once again another strong indication that it was the husband who is to be blamed and the one who screwed the marriage up by holding her back all this while and not helping her find her own thing in life other than being a supportive wife.<br/><br/>
There was also a scene when the husband was seen to have badly cut himself but again I can't tell what it is about, there were scenes of this nature that you can't quite piece it together other than making the audience realise that this is all the husband wrongdoing.<br/><br/>However there were some attempts to show some balance. The wife was not all free of fault. During the scene where the big argument took place in the house, the film brought us some insights into the wife sort of neglecting the husband and also sucking the joy out of his life, indicating that women can take the fun out of everything but in the beginning she was described as being the fun one who loves to play all the time. The argument ended very abruptly with the husband screaming some very unkind words of wishing her to die. There was however no follow through on the mistakes or shortcoming of the wife in their marriage for this story to be balanced in the later part of the show. I get it that the world wants to think that men are often oblivious to his surroundings in a marriage and are not sensitive enough to their wives needs, so there is an element of feminism too which as I said takes away from the artistic side of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end I felt the ending was too compressed and rushed. 2/3rd of the movie could have been shortened for the ending to give the story a better balance of highlighting what both parties did wrong and how viewers of gender can learn from this story. I felt this movie should not try to masquerade as a marriage story as it takes two to tango. It should be 'An Ex-Wife Story' or something like that.<br/><br/>However from directing and acting, wow, just wow. Johansson was at another level altogether, a truly versatile artist. Apologies for the typos/grammar...had to share this views within short amount of available time."

Nicole gets a positive arc while Charlie kinda gets over it after transforming himself into an insecure egoistic goofball. I don't like how this character is treated and the final scene, when Charlie gets to read Nicole's letter and gets a shoelace done, that's just WHAT IS THIS HOW YOU WANT TO END IT?
I'M so confused about this movie. I watched nearly three times and I still have mixed feelings. I hope A. Driver gets the Best Actor award."

"gailspilsbury","3","1","6","23 December 2019"," What Is the Film's Point of View?
","""Maarriage Story,"" written and directed by Noah Baumbach, stirs a lot of thoughts for audiences. It gives a realistic depiction of a youngish couple with a child going through divorce. Adam Driver plays the husband Charlie, a rising-star, theater director in New York, and Scarlett Johansson plays his wife Nicole, a talented actress in his plays. Laura Dern plays Nicole's tough L.A. divorce lawyer. Released by Netflix, the movie is billed as a drama/comedy, but there is no comedy in this film's sad, realistic portrayal of two decent persons' drifting apart, with one of them deciding to leave. After the separation, horrendous acrimony slowly builds until a final, emotional blow-up shatters everyone-the couple and the audience.<br/><br/>Whose point of view tells this story? The man's or the woman's? Or, was the take-away for a man watching this film different from the take-away for a woman? Having thoroughly experienced the couple's feelings, I, a woman, left the theater wondering if a man had experienced the characters' heartbreak differently from me. I felt it must be so, for the film's point of view lacked clarity.<br/><br/>I called a friend, a male and a millennial psychologist, and indeed his take-away was wholly different from mine. While I identified and sympathized with Nicole's stunted potential in a marriage where she served her rising-star husband, who loved her and their family life, but had no true interest in her ""being,"" who she was, as his passion and focus were totally on himself and his work and ambition. Everything else was rote for him and done according to the book of what was right and currently ""enlightened,"" such as how to be a good father, a considerate household partner, and a good, fair, and beloved director to his troupe.<br/><br/>When, as happens in long marriages, Nicole lost interest in sex, Charlie found sex with the stage manager of his company. No, he didn't love her, he just needed that kind of intimacy and ego-gratification. He is god in his world. But the affair isn't why Nicole leaves. She leaves because at age 40ish, she realizes she isn't fulfilling her own life, her own gifts, her own passion, and she will never be able to if she stays with Charlie to serve his life and his success, which includes receiving a MacArthur grant for $600,000 to further advance his talent. Moreover, his new play is going to Broadway. His power and recognition are only going to keep growing while she stays as she is-his dependable wife, his actress in second place, his competent family partner, his solace and safety when home in the nest she provides.<br/><br/>As in all marriages that begin in the mid-twenties, the partners evolve with time and their risk of not evolving together is high. Charlie and Nicole clearly love and care about each other, but the marriage is over for Nicole if she wants to live, if she wants an authentic, fulfilling life. She returns to her mother's home in L.A. when a pilot TV series offers her a role. She takes their son Henry along. It's not certain the show will take-off, so the trip is presented as short-term to see what happens. Once there, however, life feels so good to Nicole-her true identity is able to emerge, not only as an actress free from the shadow of her husband's greatness, but also as a future director herself, which is her dream. Henry also loves living in L.A. with Nicole's active, extended family life that includes cousins. The only problem is, Charlie's life is in New York, so that his career and ambition become bombed by Nicole's decision to remain in L.A. when the pilot succeeds. But it's not just the pilot that makes her stay. It's her good feelings about herself, about having a meaningful life, her right just as much as his. In L.A., she's not Charlie's appendage anymore, which was fine in her twenties when she worshiped him and came under his wing, but it's not fine now in her maturity. She has her own developed talent, equal to his when freed from its cage.<br/><br/>My male friend's take-away was different. He saw Charlie as the victim of Nicole's manipulations. She left New York knowing her L.A. stint was going to be permanent. She tricked him, and now has the child legally in L.A. causing a custody suit. Her character was shallow while his was deep. Not only that, but Adam Driver was a far better actor than Scarlett Johansson. And Nora, the aggressive L.A. lawyer, was creepy, hideous-he shuddered just remembering her.<br/><br/>I want to pause here and say that Nora, portrayed as L.A.'s toughest, man-gouging divorce lawyer for women, also affected me as a female viewer. She's groomed pejoratively: slinky, skin-revealing clothes , long blond hair incongruous with her aging face, and a fake way of communicating with her new client, all saccharine in order to win her business. Why was Nora presented this way? Perhaps to mock L.A./Hollywood culture when it comes to divorce, for Charlie's L.A. male lawyer is even worse. These characters are driven by money and how much you can get from your future ex-spouse; no concern for damage done to children and the parents in such an antagonistic, bitter, and volatile tug of war. It's crass and tragic.<br/><br/>But there's more to consider. Everything that spouts from Nora's smart, fighter lips about the double standard is true. Who is listening to her? Perhaps some members of the female audience. I heard her and as a result, overlooked her unappealing traits because she spoke the truth about male-female relationships and how society condones men and condemns women in the same situation. My male friend couldn't tolerate her, and because of her money-grasping and exterior traits, he felt even more that Nicole was a conniving manipulator and Charlie a victim. Again, the film's point of view comes up. Was everything Nicole said to Charlie about her deepest feelings and why she was leaving, and Nora's pronouncements about the double standard, part of the script for the truth they told or part of the script to mock women in favor of Charlie the battered hero?<br/><br/>It would be interesting to set up a poll to compare the male and female responses to this movie-and I welcome hearing from you. The film ends nicely, because Nicole and Charlie are able to go back to their original, honest and caring roots and dump the lawyers in their divorce. And Charlie accepts the reality that Nicole is not coming back and figures out a way to make fruitful changes in his professional life in order to be near his son. But what is the film's point of view about that, about Charlie making changes to accommodate the divorce? My point of view is: good solution. My friend's point of view might be: she forced him to wreck his career, give up his New York life and passion. Nora the lawyer might say: This film perpetuates the way society has always viewed women as demons; it upholds the superior integrity and value of men. And the film? We don't leave the theater knowing the film's point of view, but my closest guess is: Charlie's beleaguered treatment deserves our support. Hopefully it's a wrong guess."

I mean, divorce is supposed to be depressing, but these two married people are so underwhelming personality-wise, it's hard to care about either of them. We do get a fairly good education on slimy LA lawyers and how hypocritical they are. It's all kiss-kiss, hug-hug for appearances, but when it's time for the big show and screwing people over to get everything at any cost, they are snakes! Yes, all the performances are good, but the material is nothing new or ground breaking. Based on all the hoopla of the main character's performances, I was expecting to be blown away.

"christian-gavrila","5","1","7","24 December 2019"," An American Separation - inspired from A Separation but lost the humanity
","In short, watch A Separation (Jodaeiye Nader az Simin) if you want a similar story, but with a human touch. Apart for the long list of cliches, I think Marriage Story does a great injustice to children. In a divorce, the children are always the ones paying for their parents choices, they are always missing the happy family, they care for their parents and always blaming themselves for the separation. The films fails to show any real emotion of the child, as the authors were trying to feel divorced parents feel good about their children.<br/><br/>The only real thing to me were the actors playing the lawyers: Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda. All three had excellent performances, that were not wasted by the script as it happened with the two main characters. The impact of the formal approach on divorcing people's feelings and actions is the only area were this film comes close to A Separation, excepting the unrealistic lack of resentment for the terrible things done to each other by the main characters. But who can complain about realism from a film where the parents have still plenty of energy and time to spend with the child after buying two new houses in LA, without selling the old one from NY, paying the top lawyers and a lot of travel between the west coast and east coast, all while also being successful at work?<br/><br/>So, if you want feeling and a film that deserved its Oscar, watch A Separation. If you don't want the effort to think and to read subtitles, then watch this as at least the acting is better than a telenovela, but don't expect a better script."

","The title may seem ironic; 'Marriage Story' is, after all, about a divorce. However as much as it's about the end of a marriage, it's the little moments of love and affection that Baumbach really chooses to focus on. It's an engaging character study and nuanced look at the legal system that is extremely well written and features some of the best performances of the year. Seriously, Johansson and Driver are at the top of their games here, injecting life into their characters in even the quietest of moments. That's where the film really succeeds, too. For a story about a divorce, there are less arguments than you'd expect. Of course, they do happen and are expertly done (one scene in particular is destined to become a classic and is sure to be studied as a masterclass in writing and acting), but it's the restrained, subtler scenes that really create the most emotion, and highlight the strength of the piece. While it's obviously sad and emotionally affecting in that regard, it's also surprisingly funny. Even though it's never hilarious, there's a sense of humour injected into nearly every scene. This is mainly due to how realistically the piece is written, as the humour comes from common, everyday interactions more than jokes. Again, the simple fact that this tone works highlights just how strong the writing is. One of its biggest missteps, however, is its focus on Driver's character, Charlie. After an introduction to both parties, the film begins with a heavy focus on Johansson's character Nicole, then shifts to Charlie's perspective. The problem is that from there onwards the audience sees things very much from Charlie's perspective, even if the flick ensures that neither Charlie or Nicole are seen as a 'villain'. Because it initially establishes itself as a two-sided piece, it does feel a bit limiting that Charlie is undeniably the protagonist. That's not to say that Nicole isn't a great character, however. Whenever she is on screen, Johansson and the writing are great. We do primarily see her from Charlie's perspective, though, which obviously limits things. Luckily, this isn't enough of an issue to ruin the film by any means, and it's something that's more of a problem upon reflection rather than when actually watching it. Randy Newman's score is a little bit of a problem, too. While the music is in itself great, it is very similar to Newman's 'Toy Story 3' (2010) score, so whenever it plays it is simply reminiscent of that film rather than serving to enhance this one. That's a very minor issue, though, and likely something that won't affect most viewers. Overall, 'Marriage Story' is engaging throughout with a great screenplay and subtlety gripping performances. It's certainly one of the years' better films and it's a shame that most people will only be able to see it on the small screen. 7/10"

","This movie is so contrived & false that it's infuriating. Why did they put themselves & their child through all this? Because of some flimsy stubborn competitiveness established in the beginning? I'm not buying it. And even so, that just makes me loathe these characters. It even goes so far as to lay on a disingenuous feminist element that is completely off base & laughable for no other reason I can imagine than that Baumbach wanted pander to the current political climate. Laura Dern's spiel on women's disadvantages in society do not apply to the court system when deliberating custody. Conversely, it's the man rather who's dealt the disadvantage in this case(Driver even had to pay for a third of Scarlett's legal costs!). The woman is favored in such a circumstance for a reason the Liotta character explicitly brought up earlier on in the film. So, now the film contradicts itself too...
.
I can 't speak for others(clearly to some out there there's resonance here), but as a child who has virtually known divorce all his life, who cannot even remember when his parents were ever together, I could not get over how phony this all felt. As a human being I could not get over how infuriating this all felt(& not the way it was intended). Unfortunately, not even the acting could redeem it for me in any way. In fact, the acting was so good at times that my disgust for the characters would momentarily slip off onto the actors. I found this to be just a bunch of noise & emotions around nothing, wherein they waste their money & potential on divorce proceedings that neither one of them wanted, but sustained anyways out of a sick power game; meanwhile, the world's got real problems going on...In other words, there is no real problem here. Just middle-upper class, self-indulgent, first-world idiots with maniacal egos stirring one up & then acting like nothing happened because Driver needs his shoe tied...<br/><br/>If Baumbach needs a solid story to film he should consider reading some novels & optioning something because clearly he is just forcing something here out of what may be a drought of anything more substantial to say. It's a movie about people who have the resources to be relatively happy, but who create a problem for themselves & come out the other end with nothing--like nothing at all had happened. It's empty. Nobody likes a straw man argument. Well, ladies & gentleman, this is nothing more than a straw man story..."

It tells two painful things respectively: when a person has stopped expecting all the time, what she pursues has been achieved unexpectedly, and when a person finally learns to sacrifice himself for her, the person he wants to sacrifice for has gone. The movie gradually reveals the spiritual world of both parties in the conversation over and over again. How much concession the woman has in the marriage is how vicious it is in the divorce, and how selfish the man is in the marriage is how overwhelmed he is in the divorce.

That was some acting that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Scarlett was cute while dancing and singing with her mom and sister, telling us that her return to LA was going full steam ahead.<br/><br/>In addition, some lines were fantastic like ""I need my own a**hole."" Or this one:<br/><br/>""The thought of having sex with you makes me want to peel my skin off""<br/><br/>hahaha<br/><br/>But that was it. Nothing else there fore me<br/><br/>Divorces are all painful. then a movie about a divorce you can imagine what you will get for your buck.<br/><br/>Unless you love divorces and drama and tears and devastation and the breaking of a marriage, its likely you'd leave the cinema quiet, silent and wanting someone to cheer you.<br/><br/>I guess, some people love drama and tears. Others like entertaining feeling-good flicks. I belong to the second group. Did not enjoy Marriage Story.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, I love the actors and love their work and their nominations are well deserved. I just do not like the movie because do not like the story nor the script... at all. But that is just me, and this was my honest, humble opinion."

","This is a tough movie to watch if you've been divorced or are thinking about it. And even if you're happily married for that matter. At the same time, the story seems realistic enough that you could picture two people going through this experience with all of it's emotional highs and lows. As a couple, I couldn't actually relate to Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as characters married to each other. Driver in particular doesn't strike me as the leading man type, but that might have been for the better as the reasons they got married in the first place were eloquently spelled out in the pair's individual letters to each other. My first instinct about Nicole Barber (Johansson) was that she was entirely non-cooperative with the marriage counselor who was trying to help them understand why they fell in love with each other. Writing out their feelings seemed like a worthwhile project, but for Nicole not to share the information seemed quite unreasonable. As the story progresses however, we learn that the give and take in the marriage was pretty much one sided with Nicole doing all the giving, and Charlie (Driver) doing all the taking.<br/><br/>Enter the divorce attorneys and the situation takes on a grim aspect. Alan Alda's brief stint as Charlie's lawyer was quite comical actually; his unintentional (or maybe intentional) way of double talking was quite amusing and had a way of driving Charlie batty. The eventual sparring between Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern) and Jay Marotta (Ray Liotta) managed to negate the intended peaceful resolution to the divorce which had been premised by the Barbers when they first began thinking about it. As for that social worker (Martha Kelly) who called on Charlie and son Henry (Azhy Robertson), well, she looked like she could have used a good intervention herself.<br/><br/>The sad thing for the Barbers after the fact is that the marriage could probably have been saved had they allowed themselves the time and distance to come to terms with their situation. Instead, there was no happy ending here in the traditional sense, Nicole and Charlie each went their own way with no sense of fulfillment or closure for either one of them. I could have done without that theatrically inspired ending with Charlie singing to his friends at the bar back in New York. It wasn't particularly entertaining, and if you noticed, no one clapped their approval. Which is kind of the way the story leaves you feeling as a whole."

For example accusations resembling fathers and mothers came out of nowhere. There was nothing that set this up.
There's nothing particularly innovative about this film. The cinematography and editing is perfunctory, nothing special about the soundtrack, wardrobe set design etc but there are many nods to the stage for those looking for something a bit deeper.

"xxmisskirstenxx","7","0","1","11 January 2020"," It's okay, but forgettable
","I watched this movie with my husband and the very high rating of ofcourse lead to high expectations. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to those expectations. Yes, the acting is great, but you don't really build a connection with any of the characters. Even though a lot of effort is put into the dialogues, it still feels like you never really get to know them, and therefore, you don't truly root for them. We watched it without any background information, so we were hoping on a marriage revival, but this never happens. You don't even see them make an effort to save it, despite the very touching letters they wrote about each others qualities in the beginning of the movie. For me, the movie was interesting while I believed there was still a chance of them making it better. That a deeper layer might be touched, instead of all the superficial lawyer stuff. (Which was amusing, and sometimes uncomfortable, but nothing more than that). However, it's all about the breakup and therefore, 'Divorce Story' would have been a better name. I cried while watching Mrs Doubtfire (also a dramatic comedy about a divorce, and a father doing anything to see his kids), but with this movie: not a single tear, not even close. The difference is: in Mrs Doubtfire, you could actually truly relate to the characters and their motives, their pain, you get attached to them as a family and as individuals. Marriage story didn't do that for us at all and I'm sure I've forgotten about this movie in 1 or 2 years. I'm still not sure what this movie wanted to teach us, if anything."

Moreover, I did not expect anything that great when I saw the trailer because of their lack of charisma, but the excellent performance of Scarlett moved me, as if I totally forgot that she was Scarlett! Hahaha.<br/><br/>The story, though, really showed how disagreements are solved if lawyers are to be involved.

"jayparenteau","8","0","1","4 January 2020"," Yeah but I'm in it for the art..
","I went into my viewing of this film with the idea that it would be wonderfully acted, that was my one expectation having previously seen several scenes flash across my Instagram feed. The film was. Oh but that's not all...<br/><br/>First, there are so many stylistic choices that the director/writers made such as overlapping of voices in tense moments, tempo of action, and an overall mesmerizing choreography, (especially during a scene based around a film set) that make subconscious emotions flood into any viewers head. I loved it.<br/><br/>Second, framing by the cinematographer is excellent even when it breaks rules. In fact, especially when it breaks rules. There is a monologue that goes on for minutes, (feels like hours) where, as the dialogue progresses, the camera gets tighter and tighter on the subjects face. Not only does this highlight the emotion of the scene but draws the viewer in and makes them feel the ""trapped"" perspective of the helpless character. Another particularly beautiful idea was to stick 2 characters in the corner of a room and use the walls to guide the viewers perspective all the way into the corner. Normally this would be a no-no, especially because one of the characters bodies is turned to the camera, however again this illustrates the characters metaphorical position in life, he/she is being backed into a corner and their fate is unclear. Absolutely brilliant!<br/><br/>Here's why it's not a 10/10. A. I'm biased against sad movies, sorry I just am. B. There are several lines delivered by an otherwise Oscar-worthy performance by Adam Driver that feel like he didn't even try to deliver them. They fell so flat and ruined some scenes credibility. It made me remember I was watching a movie, (not good).<br/><br/>All in all it was a phenomenal experience and I feel like a better person after having viewed it, it puts a lot of things into perspective. This movie is centralized around divorce and I'm fortunate enough to not have had people close to me experience it (yet). Having said that it made me feel a ton of emotions and if it can do that for me, I'm sure it can for you!"

Their portrayal of parents who have so this much respect for each other and think they should hate each other and just don't, or can't. It's a tough thing to do, I felt like I was a watching a more entertaining update of Kramer Vs. Kramer. I loved every moment, but the pivotal argument scene that comes in quite late, which was bubbling under the surface for the whole film until it hits you in the face, Driver as Charlie seriously made me cry!<br/><br/>It's going to be a battle for Best Actor at the Oscars between Driver for this and Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. They both deserve to win.<br/><br/>Luckily being a Netflix film, I saw limited run at a cinema not far from home, like with The Irishman and The Two Popes, I did NOT watch them at home.

","Marriage Story(2019) by Noah Baumbach, who is often referred to as a younger version Woody Allen, would perhaps the most impressive and heart-melting film in this year.
1.66:1 aspect ratio, unique.
What I love about the film is the screenwriter's well use of details, which really reminds me of the story about the condemned who avoided little puddles before being executed. Things like the haircutting, toilet flushing, lights turning, and door closing are not something easy for ordinary screenwriters to come up with.<br/><br/>
Another thing I really like about it is the cinematography, especially the sense of film(35mm). I wonder what type of camera they use.
After searching on IMDb
(Arricam LT, Panavision Primo Lenses
Arricam ST, Panavision Primo Lenses
Arriflex 435, Panavision Primo Lense)
I like the shallow depth of field that creates the deviation, the sense of distance of characters.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I like the shift of characters, especially the character arc of Charlie.
Nicole ordering from the menu for Charlie, another powerful detail.
I like the overlapped lines, such as others' comments on protagonists and the whispers on the court.
One thing that's worth noticed is the monologue made by Nicole's lawyer. This could be a feminist expression(or discussion) made by the director.
After they signed the contract, they both raised their heads. And it comes to the dissolved transition, which I always want to have in my videos.<br/><br/>
Making mistakes while closing the closet, powerful a detail.
Coming out of a subway and encountering the flyer sender who wants others to care about animals are nice details, well-designed echoing.
Charlie singing Being Alive, a master-stroke.
The son's dyslexia might be designed to serve the part of the letter reading at the end, also a brilliant echoing.
I like the echoing of the beginning and end.<br/><br/>
""Self-fish"", ""self-sufficient"", a joke with complex feelings.
Costumes of the Beatles definitely adds some flavour to this film.<br/><br/>
I like the film's score, which contributes to the family's ambience. Mommy phase and Sgt. Pepper Shoelaces are my favourites for the downward marching of chords.
Tying up shoelaces, a final master-stroke.<br/><br/>
I always want my videos to include credit part like this(and The Darjeeling Limited).
Netflix produced the two best films in 2019. (Another one is The Irishman by Martin Scorsese)

","When Marriage Story begins, the marriage in question is already over. Here and there, in the beginning, the viewer might even question why they split up in the first place, or if they might get back together, but it becomes clear soon enough that, in the words of The Replacements' ""Never Mind"" ...it's all over but the shouting.<br/><br/>And so let's talk about the shouting. That instantly meme-worthy scene that took the internet by storm as soon as this puppy hit Netflix: wow. I mistakenly watched that and just that, and in comparison to the understated, well-edited trailers, it was an assault. It seemed as if there was no way the film could find itself there, or worse: was that, could that be the tonal emotional mean? Thankfully, it is not. At all. And, though that scene mostly doesn't work, it doesn't feel *so* out of place that the viewer is pulled out of the story. This is a film about tension, and the majority of that tension is unseen or implied. There's a lot of passive aggressiveness on display in place, and that felt real.<br/><br/>This is low 9 out of 10 in my opinion. I don't think it's Baumbach's best, but it's at least his best since 2013's Frances Ha. (Quick ranking of Baumbach: #1 Squid #2 Frances #3 Greenburg #4? Probably this)"

","If you would read no further than this line: this is a beautiful film and you should see it.<br/><br/>Noah Baumbach has taken the same ingredients he used for his last film, The Meyerowitz Stories, and has balanced them with more skill, leading to a picture that shines on all fronts .<br/><br/>We observe the main characters, Charlie and Nicole, as they go through the motions of their divorce. We watch them struggle with their desires while they try to frame everything leading up to the separation - meanwhile going through all the emotions that bubble to the surface. They have a young child, Henry. Their relationship with him as they go through the break up is redefined, as the parents labor to keep their difficulties out of his world as much as possible. From the film's opening on you are invested in these people and that doesn't change until the end credits are rolling.<br/><br/>Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are just lovely. I mean, I don't know what else to say. These are two top of the line actors portraying well written characters in a heartfelt story. What's not to like? They make you feel deeply for Charlie and Nicole - their confusion, despair, frustration, doubt and hope, come across as believable and genuine. There will be moments in the film where you will feel their pain, and laugh at their silliness as they try to keep their heads above water.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a perfect fit, with Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta being particularly good as the divorce lawyers. I won't say too much about their characters or performances as not to spoil the film, but let's just say they represent that side of human nature we would rather avoid having to acknowledge.<br/><br/>Baumbach's unique writing style delivers a mix of clever, engaging and sometimes hilarious dialogue and a story that makes the character's feel very real and relatable.<br/><br/>This film is a great reminder that right and wrong, in their absolute fairytale forms, don't exist. People endeavor to love and often times they eventually fail. And while that's okay, the suffering that comes with it is inevitable. This picture does well in showing what that means on an existential front as wel as displaying the harsh pragmatical and logistical side of things that comes with a divorce when there's a kid in the picture, without giving us any easy, pre-made conclusions to hold on to."

"fernandorocha-Brasil","10","0","1","13 December 2019"," A story that never ends...
","Scarlett Johansson is mesmerizing in everything she does - performing a role, singing, dancing, and defending her political views, existing, simply. Everything in her is delicately appropriate: the firm, and at the same time, smooth voice; the skewed and hypnotizing eyes, the provoking lips as perfect frames for touching words as ""love"" and ""nostalgia"", her performance in the movie built by the way she looks, in all possible senses. The movie begins with a formula: over an assembling of scenes, Nicole (Scarlett) and Charlie (Adam Driver) exchange compliments. We soon realize that it is discourse written in a therapeutic session. They are on the verge of separation, that indefinable, painful, irreparable, destructive, incapacitating moment. Yes, before the rupture, there was love and affection, and this is the most devastating punch at this point. Nevertheless, there is a child and he is going to be used as a manipulative element by both of them, which invariably happens in these cases. There are also the parts' lawyers: Laura Dern and Ray Liotta rock maneuvering the divorce in an indignantly and competitive way. Nicole and Charlie are at that process in which neither of them knows exactly why the marriage failed, and this is disturbing for them and, of course, for us. It seems clear that each other's dimension got lost along the time they spent together, despite (or because) the connections that still exist between them. Scarlett is the physical form of talent, playing a woman who wants the best for her family, but cannot wait anymore to make her dreams come true. Adam Driver takes off Kylo Ren's character and takes the plunge into the role that may redefine him as one of the most talented actors of his time - his losses, after the separation, are shown on his face like Mike Tyson's jabs. The director Noah Baumbach displays autobiographical references in his works, as he did in his best movie so far THE SQUID AND THE WHALE. It is not different here: he shows a depressing trait of the post-modern times, the outsourcing of the sentimental matters, in charge, here, of the two lawyers, who fight over everything that could have been but was not, as once said Manuel Bandeira."

","The film is amazing and MOTY in terms of acting and staging. But, I feel as if the 'affluent family' angle does little to make the story feel relatable to The Average Personâ„¢.

"Cineanalyst","7","0","3","10 December 2019"," Cinema as Theatre; Theatre as Life
","There are a couple potential problems with making such semi-autobiographical, personal pictures as Noah Baumbach does. One, you probably either need to relate to or be intrigued by the familial squabbling of such middle-to-upper-class New York artists and intellectuals, pretentious or otherwise. Having seen a few of his movies now, from one Baumbach episode to the next, I've found that it gets tiresome fast. Second and encompassing the first hindrance is the underlying philosophy of art as simply being a reflection of one's life. An obvious antecedent for this writer-director is Woody Allen, but say what you will about Allen, artistically his oeuvre isn't that rudimentary. Consequently, perhaps, there's no substantial distinction made in Baumbach's outlook between cinema and theatre (that is, besides the either hypocritical or self-deprecating snootiness within the movie)--both are for Baumbach to play life on a stage, including this second installment, after ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005), in his intimately cathartic stories of divorce. ""Marriage Story"" is likely his best picture yet, though, because of how it integrates storytelling in life, plays and movies. While the actual story here is about divorce, the structure is about the union of those three stages of narratives; it's a marriage story, after all.<br/><br/>Indeed, as the couple's attorneys outline, their divorce battle is over the construction of the narrative. Are they a New York family or a Los Angeles one? Is the theme that he's a philanderer or that she's a lush, he a liar who trapped her in the Big Apple or she a felonious hacker who tricked him into allowing her an upperhand in the custody case over their son? In a relatively even-handed manner, the plot serves both narratives with a dual focus alternating between the perspective of the husband-father (Adam Driver) and that of the wife-mother (Scarlett Johansson). He begins as a director, casting her as the actress in his life, but her move to Hollywood includes her branching into directing, as well, both motion pictures and her life. Legally, meanwhile, the expensive lawyers form the couples' perspectives to be enacted, including on the courtroom stage.<br/><br/>While this divorce proceeds, these protagonists introduced as theatrical people, him a director and her an actress, are pulled from (off) Broadway to Hollywood. Aesthetically, there were already indications of this in their ridiculous-looking play, as it included recorded moving images of her beside the actress in the flesh. It's a multimedia performance, which in the larger scheme is a play-within-a-play and a movie-within-the-movie that we're watching. A brief search of Baumbach's biography will suffice to point out the obvious parallels here with his life. Like the male lead, he married an actress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose big break in Hollywood was a role in a raunchy teen comedy (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982)). Both couples, then, had a child and divorced. Baumbach similarly fictionalized his parents' breakup in ""The Squid and the Whale.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, it's not cinema and theatre that divorce in the picture. For the most part, the acting and writing are engaging enough, but some of the blocking and monologues are as conspicuously stagy as Johansson being carried in the play-within-the-play. The long, steady framings and fades to black compound this. Driver's song at the end was ineffective for me because of its theatricality. Likewise, Johansson's first speech to her attorney, what with her walking around while pontificating, came off as especially affected (it works somewhat better when Alan Alda basically does the same thing later in his first scene with Driver). On the other hand, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta are impressive at getting to the point of the story when it's their turn to tell it. The fawning letters the protagonists write of each other that frames the movie's narrative overall is effective, as well. Regardless, it's not the story or the characters here that interest me, let alone how it reflects life and issues of divorce; it's the structure that matters. The case is built and won or lost based on who is directing and how the narrative is constructed."
"mmwea","8","0","3","10 December 2019"," SHOULD BE CALLED DIVORCE STORY
","This movie is excellent, but I think it's strange that it's called marriage story, because it's entirely about a divorce-which is strangely, as you will know if you have been through it, not really about the marriage anymore. All the performances are top-notch, and the two leads are brilliant, though for some reason Scarlett Johansson, in her wardrobe, grooming, and behavior, plays the part as a somewhat masculine lesbian, which made me keep thinking there was going to be a turn of events that never occurred-which, in turn, made that choice inexplicable. Also, the two randomly inserted Stephen Sondheim songs are simply bizarre in context. They are poorly performed, and seem to be there for absolutely no reason whatsoever. But these are small things compared to the overall product, which is well worth watching."

","Marriage Story is an amazing film. It's Noah Baumbach's best film. It's a film about divorce.<br/><br/>Those three statements are completely unexpected, and I'm thrilled to be saying them. Reminiscent of 70's tearjerkers like Kramer Vs. Kramer, with a pinch of Annie Hal, Baumbach has delivered his most emotionally complete and competently structured film to date, that effectively grips you into the story of these two characters, and the fractured family that they represent. Nicole and Charlie are flawed people, but really decent. They hate each other at all. They'd do anything for their son. But their passions for their art got in the way of a pitch perfect marriage. This is not a couple that should be getting divorced, but they are. Baumbach's message is clear, and poignant. Marriage is a difficult thing. Not everyone is cut out for it. Even people who love each other tremendously aren't meant to be together forever. But even when divorces begin amicably, it's inevitable that it creates an emotional fracture between the respective partners that can rarely be reconciled. In other words, it's heartbreaking. We really root for Charlie and Nicole throughout. We painfully watch them come further apart, when we wish they wouldn't.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson and Adam Driver give phenomenal performances here. The fight scene between the two of them, as per the climax, is an acting masterclass for the ages. The way they emotionally unravel in front of us is impressively real. Like a true marriage on the outs. The entire film is riveting. Near perfect, has it not been for Charlie's musical number towards the end that felt over-indulgent and pretentious. Noah, you need to get out your own way."

"blanbrn","6","0","3","9 December 2019"," A film that will make one feel sad and gloom, still the performances and story is direct and honest.
","Just watched ""Marriage Story"" and this film shows that life and love between a husband and wife can be complicated and painful and it's very hurtful when it has to end. In fact director Noah Baumbach based this on his real life marriage break up. This film is really a strong drama about the going down the drain of a marriage between Nicole(Scarlett Johansson) and Charlie(Adam Driver) and they have a young son named Henry and that makes things even tougher.<br/><br/>The couple split their time between both coast as Charlie wants to stay in New York with his theater productions, and Nicole wants to go stay in sunny L.A. and be a free spirited actress, yet oddly this is the plan and the best way they feel to divorce and uncouple. And the process is tough and raw actually sometimes painful to watch. Enter the wild cards that being the lawyers to help steer thru the rocky waves. Watch Laura Dern shine as a tough yet smart elegant divorce attorney named Nora.<br/><br/>This picture shows how all involved are affected and the damage that a divorce does it's like an ever lasting wound since a kid is involved. The chemistry and acting was great from both Adam and Scarlett yet the wild card was the performance from Laura as she was like a shining queen who sparkled with every take."

","Driver and Johanssen are a married couple who are divorcing - the film charts the impact upon them and how they will manage custody of their young son.<br/><br/>This is not light entertainment and you need to be in a receptive mood to fully appreciate it. If you are, this is a touching and wrenching tale of the emotionally draining experience divorce can undoubtedly be - particularly via the California legal system. What is most affecting and impressive is the utterly compelling performances by both leads who both deserve at least Oscar nods.<br/><br/>Driver singing Being Alive near the end is a sensation."

","Essentially a two-hander between Johansson and Driver, with extended cameos from others, this is the story of two extraordinary people in search of a way to feel fulfilled creatively even if it means their marriage falls apart. While Nicole and Charlie are both relatable in terms of being decent human beings, they're also quite extraordinary in terms of their careers - she an aspiring actress finding success in TV after building a great reputation in her husband's off-broadway plays, while he's a naturally gifted award-winning director director. As a couple they have worked as a team to build each other up, but their achievements bring opportunities that pull them in opposite directions - Nicole to LA and Charlie to stay in NY. Which is when the problems start, exacerbated by Nicole wanting their son, Henry, to accompany her to LA while she shoots her TV series.<br/><br/>At its centre Johansson and Driver play two people who were deeply in love and drove each other to success, that much is obvious in the way they behave towards each other throughout, even when arguing. Both actors have great scenes in which allow them to move from one emotion to the next with a slow build intensity that suddenly explodes: initial compassion brimming up to overflowing bitterness, civil reasonableness descending into festering anger. They both shine. Despite things spiralling from promises once made between young lovers to the grab-all-you-can machiavellian greed of lawyers, these two still care for each other and if they can resolve their differences is at the heart of their story.<br/><br/>Nicole and Charlie's wealth - her family isn't poor, and he wins an award that gives him means - allow them privileges that most would envy, which is where the story loses points for relatability. There's no real struggle to make ends meet when hiring top line divorce lawyers - Charlie struggles for a moment, but it then becomes too one-sided and just in time he wins an award which evens things up...insert convenient plot-device. Make no mistake, these are no ordinary couple: they are privileged, extremely gifted, white, and any day-to-day struggle is easily mended so that it doesn't become a gaping crack to be papered over later.<br/><br/>While Johansson and Driver make the most of their roles their son, Henry, goes about his day to day almost as if there's little affect on him - other than looking like a dead ringer for the child in The Shining; alas, neither parent come to find him writing 'RedRum' at any time, the most he can muster is an occasional whinge about a first-world problem.<br/><br/>I could watch Merritt Wever all day long, she steals every scene she's in and is an absolute star. Between this and Unbelievable she's certainly made a lasting impression as one to watch for the future.<br/><br/>Laura Dern is silky smooth as an unctuous divorce lawyer well-practiced in buttering up clients and leveraging innocent comments, while Ray Liotta is aggressively persuasive as her battle-hardened counterpart always in fight-mode; Alan Alda is the sage old 4 times married semi-retired lawyer Charlie is saddled with when he first becomes aware of how serious things are. The lawyers live in a completely different world to Nicole and Charlie, theirs is a world of emotional manipulation and direction for profit, not art.<br/><br/>Everyone gives it socks and there's plenty of good humour, tenderness, spite and compassion to make the characters rounded and full of life. All-in-all, a feel good aspirational divorce flick."
"yusufpiskin","9","0","2","7 December 2019"," Alan Alda
","I love Alan Alda so much.<br/><br/>Very hard to watch this movie without immediately recognizing it as Noah Baumbach's attempt to reconcile his own divorce in the most self-aggrandizing way, but I will forgive it on the sole condition that Laura Dern either runs me over with her car or allows me to treat her to a lovely expensive dinner and then never calls me again. Your choice, Laura!"
