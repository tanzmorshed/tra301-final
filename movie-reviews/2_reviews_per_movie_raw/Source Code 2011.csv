","The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.<br/><br/>Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.<br/><br/>Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film. <br/><br/>To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films."

","My first glance, I thought it's gonna be an ordinary action movie. The guy will look for the bomber, He'll find the bomber, he wants to save the girl, Eventually he saves the girl. But the movie isn't like that. The movie ends up having mysteries with unpredictably smart revelations. It's not an action blockbuster cookie cutter. It's a unique kind of movie that intrigues the whole cinema and let us enjoy the ride in a new way.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" is not a clichéd mediocre action blockbuster. The movie avoids being predictable and wants to be smart and mind-bending. Duncan Jones isn't the kind of director who cares about the action. By the way this is his first action movie but he's smart for not making super cool unrealistic action scenes. He cares about the story. The movie have many intriguing subplots that is not easy to figure out. The movie wanted to be as smart as possible.<br/><br/>The performances were great. Jake Gyllenhaal made the whole game exciting. Michelle Monaghan shows her role's innocence. Vera Farmiga is obviously good in here. Jeffery Wright is the best among the four. The rest of the filmmaking, Chris Bacon's music score sounds old fashion and I liked it. The effects isn't really that great but it doesn't matter. The script is indeed smart. The movie also has a heart.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" is as good as ""Limitless"". Both of them had the same reason why is it good. It's smart, intriguing(I've said this word many times in this review), and indeed original. Most action movies these days wanted to be super cool and super loud. ""Source Code"" doesn't really have a big action but it's more fun, made more sense and it's super smart."
"lmelnick-999-260424","8","287","408","11 March 2011"," Suspenseful thriller with a twist
","I was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and attended the Q&A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake and Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make Chicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it feels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this film delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly recommended."
"drammer56","9","310","447","20 March 2011"," Excellent Thriller
","I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller I've seen in years. <br/><br/>Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The writing is outstanding. All four principal actors do well and Gyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well.<br/><br/>At the start, I feared a stock, predictable Hollywood thriller. But soon I found myself en wrapped in Gyllenhaal's puzzle-within-a puzzle.<br/><br/>At the end, the Industry audience for this screening erupted in spontaneous applause.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones is definitely a young director to watch.<br/><br/>If you like thrillers, go see this film!"

","What a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to the point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time getting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are there, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and an end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time telling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that keeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code' which is fantastic. The only downside to this film is that it feels short, it was 93 minutes but it simply flies by. Maybe that is a good thing? Shows how good this film was!<br/><br/>GO CHECK IT OUT!"

","I was looking forward to seeing "" Source Code "" ever since I saw the 1st trailer, and I was lucky enough to catch it in an advance screening, before it officially released here, and it just exceeded my expectations. this is the type of movies that will keep you interested till the very ending . it's probably the best sci-fi/thriller since Inception ! no big action scenes, no big explosions, no usage of unnecessary CGI, well-written story, solid performance from Mr. Gyllenhaal ( who is now officially one of my favorite actors ) and another hit from my newest favorite filmmaker Duncan Jones. don't miss it !"
"fdbjr","6","249","405","4 April 2011"," Absolutely Unnecessary Coda - Contains Spoilers
","I happen to see this picture yesterday, with a friend of mine, and liked it quite a bit. But it illustrates an increasing problem with big budgeted movies. Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the hero, an Army helicopter pilot, coming to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He's being addressed by a pretty girl as her boyfriend. He has various interactions with other passengers. He has no idea of what's going on. As he's trying to figure out who and where he is, a bomb detonates, killing everyone.<br/><br/>He finds himself back in a cell, something like a space capsule. He's informed that he's just been a part of a computer simulation, that the train was blown up that morning, that he's been cybernetically linked with the remnants of one of the victims (let it go, this is science fiction), and that his mission is to ID the bomber and prevent him or her from doing more damage. The simulation repeats and he's off again, a bit wiser, and wiser with every iteration.<br/><br/>Now, you don't have to be an experienced science fiction reader (which I am) to figure out that the Army pilot is dead, that these computer people are hooking up his brain to the simulation. Live people don't end up inside computer programs. But this does come as a big surprise to the captain, and to the more naive members of the audience. And it does set up what should have been a really original ending.<br/><br/>The hero finally completes the mission, having fallen for the girl along the way. He knows he's dead, and so is she, and all this is virtual reality. He pleads with the sympathetic operator to let him redo the simulation one last time, then let him die - completely. Touched, she agrees, even though the ogre chief of the project wants to 'wipe his memory' and use him again. <br/><br/>And what happens in the last iteration is what should have made the movie memorable. Knowing this is his last remnant of consciousness, what he does the last time is make everyone in the train car happy. He's learned a great deal about them the other times through. He bets a comedian (whom he has recognized from television) all the money he has that he can't make everyone on the car laugh. The man takes the bet and proceeds to do just that. As the seconds tick down to the inevitable end, when they'll all be incinerated, he takes the girl in his arms, tells her he loves her, and wants to be with her forever. The frame freezes and pans the whole length of the car, revealing every passenger laughing or in various states of bliss. This is the instant that will see the hero into eternity.<br/><br/>Not bad, completely unexpected, and, like the best twists, revealing that the theme of the drama was something completely different than the detective story it seemed to be. It's always nice to be surprised like that. I will confess to having to deal with moist eyes constantly at movies, and this was another occasion. A perfect ending. I reached for my hat, expecting the credits to roll up, and . . . . .<br/><br/>. . . it wasn't over. It went on for another 15 minutes, into the most God-awful coda you ever saw, completely obliterating the premises of the story, so bad I am not going to describe it.<br/><br/>What goes on? My guess is that when they previewed the movie, they found that the some members of the audience were dismayed that people as cute and likable as Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Monaghan have to suffer the fate they do. A happy ending required. I think that's what happens, given production costs and promotion costs in the tens of millions. Trusting the better sense of the audience is a thing of the past. Too much sunk cost."
"slayerjmk95","9","119","189","27 March 2011"," Duncan Jones
","When i saw this at a preview screening, i was not surprised to find another great film from one of the best sci-fi directors of our time; Duncan Jones, who brought us the instant classic, Moon. Source Code is in part an original movie but bears brief resemblance to Tony Scott's Action/Thriller Deja Vu. Source Code centers itself around Colter Stevens, an AFO soldier who wakes upon a train, not knowing how he got there or why and how people are addressing him as someone else, and soon enough the train explodes, supposedly killing everyone. But Stevens awakes to find himself in a kind of ""machine"" called the Source Code.<br/><br/>The whole story is fantastic, with a man (Stevens) having to go back in time and trying to find out who is behind the bombing. With even more praise is the directing, script, and the choice of actors for the roles. Jake Gyllenhaal was perfect in the role of Stevens as Jeffery Wright was for his role as Dr. Rutledge who believes everything has to go his way or the ""mission"" will be ruined. Overall, this is a thriller that is not to be missed. But for those who have seen this as well, i agree that if the ending was different and more powerful, the movie would be an INSTANT science fiction classic, but it falls just short of that. Still one that will be remembered for all time, in my opinion.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars***"
"Dr_Sagan","Null","29","41","1 February 2017"," Good sci-fi thriller, totally ruined by its ridiculous ""Hollywood Happy"" ending.
","This a very late review. I saw the movie back in 2011 and 2 other times since now in 2017.<br/><br/>Generally is a good sci-fi thriller that for me is ruined by its preposterous ending.<br/><br/>Mind though that the cinematic ending isn't the original. Hollywood producers insisted for a happy ending so they ruined the movie putting a ridiculous twist that simply doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>So, go and see it. Its production is good and there is the proper amount of suspense to make it interesting. I like Michelle Monaghan's performance in this, and Jeffrey Wright's up to a point, but Jake Gyllenhaal is looking to nervous in the lead."
"stephisthekingpin","8","58","90","11 May 2011"," A sci-fi narrative explored the traditional way
","Source Code is the 2nd feature film from English Director Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie). Duncan has showed audiences twice now that his narrative can be told boldly without excessive explosions and unnecessary cgi by exploring an idea and the implications it entails; which is what should be the basis of any story.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, an Army helicopter pilot; Or at least he's convinced he is. After waking on a Chicago train unaware of his surroundings or Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a woman so eagerly talking to him, Colter discovers that everything is not as it seems. Following being referred to as Sean and a deep look into the bathroom mirror, Colter learns that his appearance and character on the outside is not the one he knows.<br/><br/>Waking as himself his real self this is, Colter finds himself talking to Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) a scientist for an unknown organisation. Post a series of memory regaining techniques, he is informed that the commuter train he was previously on has been destroyed by a terrorist attack, which is only the beginning of disastrous attacks to follow. Colter learns that the brain of one of the victims contains memories of the last 8 minutes prior to the explosion, and by re-running those minutes they can discover their terrorist and prevent a major attack on Chicago.<br/><br/>An advanced computer program run by the mysterious organisation allows Colter to live the final 8 minutes and discover the terrorist before it's too late. Experiencing Déjà vu on every re-entry aboard the train, Colter can remember all of the memories of his previous visits, even though for Christina and the other passengers aboard it's happening for the first time.<br/><br/>Our hero begins to care for Christina, as much as any male would for any number of characters portrayed by Michelle Monaghan in recent times. Colter's ability to act upon free will within the 8 minutes produces the idea that he could positively change the outcome for himself, the passengers, the scientists and most importantly the love interest.<br/><br/>The mastermind behind the operation Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) is desperate for it's success regardless of the lives it may cost along the way, which could compromise Colter's outcome. In a race to save Chicago from certain destruction Colter is destined for selfless courage. <br/><br/>The well casted characters are certainly above satisfaction, particularly Vera Farmiga who although is not the love interest will win the heart of the viewer. Don Burgess' photography is great, steady camera-work makes all the scenes believable despite the science of the story being absurd, but that's what makes Sci-fi so enjoyable. Perhaps it was the sound quality of the cinema I was in but I wasn't taken by Chris Bacon's Music Score it doesn't even put a notch on Clint Mansell's work collaborating with Jones on his previous film.<br/><br/>Whether it be a Trademark from the director or a homage to his previous film ""Moon"", Jones includes a subtle reference that fans will easily notice if not the first time around there's a 2nd hint. <br/><br/>Sci-fi in recent times continually proves that it's not a dying genre, take Christopher Nolan's Inception, acclaimed modern masterpiece or Independent sensations District 9 and Moon for e.g. Whether the viewer identifies Source Code as a Sci-fi or a thriller they will be taken on a visually pleasing experience nonetheless. Rating 4/5"
"rgkarim","9","55","90","2 April 2011"," Much better than expected
","At first I was expecting the source code to be a mediocre mystery that was all about reviving a dead girl. However, this was not the case at all in this movie, which was a welcome change. The Source code was a thriller that was constantly moving, constantly generating questions, and keeping the movie interesting. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the variety of traits the main character, Gylenhall, shows in the movie who has a strong sense of justice, duty, honor, and love. Unlike some movies, the main character is not an idiot pilot, and has considerable knowledge of a variety of topics, one being quantum theory. Another positive quality of this movie, is how each visit in the source code continues to build up to the climax of the movie. The constant search for new pieces of evidence is also intertwined with constant character development of the protagonist allowing you to get a better attachment to the character. Another thing I found fun was each time he came out of the code, the character and story development continue to take place, again driving the action. Now let's talk about some weaknesses of the movie: One big thing is the protagonist seems to be too perfect, his collective traits of knowing advanced quantum theory make him a little unbelievable. A second thing is the explanation and ending may be too complicated or too unreal for some audience members, though I did enjoy the ending that took place. The third flaw has been present ever since the trailer came out in which the person who bombed the train is also planning to make another attack. As a result, this automatically narrows the suspects on the train. If you keep thinking during the movie then you can figure out who it is within probably two or three visits to the code. Regardless of the weaknesses, the thought, development, and constant pace are more than enough to keep you entertained and happy. At the same time it also has some good morals built in about finding true happiness and working through the negatives of the world. Thus overall I would give this movie an 8.5-9 on my scale. I hope you enjoy as well."
"neodante23","7","94","161","16 March 2011"," The train now arriving at platform 4 is running 8 mins late
","Went to a London preview screening of the film and found it a very enjoyable sci-fi thriller, with the repetitive time loop device having enough variation each time around to keep the viewer hooked.<br/><br/>Only those with a degree in quantum physics might understand the science behind it but essentially this whodunit mystery with Jake as our protagonist (Airforce Captain, Colter Stevens) trying to find out who caused a bomb on the train is an attention grabbing ride. Initially Colter confusion about what's happening to him is a bit drawn out at first but important in light of events later on in the film which reveal what the source code is and how he is being sent through time.<br/><br/>There is a twist to the film although cannier viewers than me might summarise this early on however and this is built up gradually. when the real situation is revealed it is a poignant moment and really anchors the predicament of Jake with the viewer.<br/><br/>I'm almost certain that everyone who leaves the film will be pondering the same question and that is whether Duncan Jones' movie would have made a more lasting (albeit darker) impression if ended at a crucial moment in the last act of the movie. Who knows what the original ending was conceived to be but in this case I think it's fair to say its the destination rather than the journey that could have elevated this to something extra. Still I would say 'all board' to those of you meaning to catch this."
"Klenic","10","85","148","31 March 2011"," Source Code - Does it live up to Moon?
","Oh, how we all love us some good old fashioned Contained Action- Thrillers! Last year we got the dreadful but noteworthy ""Unstoppable"" - in which our two heroes stationed themselves inside a moving train in an attempt to stop an unmanned freight train heading toward a city. Let it be noted, that film is nothing like Source Code. No sir, not one bit. What is Source Code, you ask? Think something along the lines of Die Hard/Groundhog Day/Clue-The board game, in a nutshell. <br/><br/>So, what makes this film different? It's smart, focused, and suspenseful. Whereas in Unstoppable, we pretty much knew where the whole deal was heading. But we're not talking about that film. This is Source Code, and i'm going to tell you straight up, this flick is the best film this year SO FAR. <br/><br/>Source Code begins with our lead character, Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall), waking up on a Chicago commuter train, opposite Christina (Michelle Monaghan) a woman whom we sense he's never met, talking to him as if they've known each other some time. Immediately after, we learn that he's a Helicopter pilot for the US Army, and that he in fact has never met this woman before. He has no clue how he's gotten to where he is, or why. All he knows is that this woman apparently knows him well, and thinks his name is 'Sean'. Confused by all of this, he goes to the bathroom, only to find that the person in the mirror isn't him, it's someone else. As us, the audience, try to process all of this information in our mind, the train abruptly explodes into flames, killing everyone on board. <br/><br/>The opening immediately attaches you to the story, with the great score, unsettling tone, and disorienting editing. It also leaves us with tons of questions: What the hell just happened? Who is Christina? Who is this 'Sean' Character? Why is Colter in this situation?<br/><br/>Then Colter wakes up again, but now in a dimly lit cement capsule, alone, talking to fellow soldier Goodwin. We discover that the commuter train he was just on was destroyed by a terrorist bomb earlier that day, and that there may be an even larger attack that could destroy Chicago. We also learn that he's a participant in an experimental Army intelligence program that allows him to continually relive the last eight minutes of one of the train's passengers life (Sean), in order to find the bomb and the terrorist who has threatened the larger attack in the heart of Chicago. <br/><br/>And like Groundhog Day, he experiences the same events over and over again, remembering each and every one. Giving him the chance to inspect every suspicious passenger, as well as getting to know Christina a bit more a long the way, and eventually beginning to care for her safety. But unfortunately, all of the these people are already dead, they only exist in the parallel universe of the 'Source Code'. Every eight minutes he's warped back to the capsule, where he is debriefed by Jeffery Wright and Vera Farmiga's characters, then sent back into the Source Code. <br/><br/>The science behind the film is very far-fetched, so it's up to you, the viewer, to let go and let Duncan Jones and his crew take over your mind for an hour and a half. And he promises a very intense thrill ride that will definitely be memorable in the future as a very intelligent and unique take on the contained thriller. Nevertheless, there definitely are plot-holes in the film, and the ending is maybe too subtle for the everyday sci-fi fanatic. But i believe it's safe to say that this film succeeds in almost every category, with the constant suspense and mystery, great action sequences, and the amazing score. Source Code keeps you guessing throughout, anticipating who the bomber could be. The very definition of High Concept.<br/><br/>Source Code is well deserved full price worthy movie that hopefully will become a box office success as well. God knows Hollywood doesn't put out enough original material like this anymore.<br/><br/><ul><li>J.G.</li></ul>"
"dhruvasomayaji","9","16","23","10 June 2011"," Those 8 minutes!!
","First of us i have to say this is a brilliant stuff! Hollywood people have mastered the art of concept based movies. This one is a great testimony to their skills. This is easily the best movie of 2011 so far and a real thriller after inception.<br/><br/>The protagonist is the captain who is killed in a mission in Afghanistan but his body is recovered and it is used to accomplish a mission through the help of program loop called source code.<br/><br/>Some concepts used are programming, afterlife, quantum physics, psychology. But all are brilliantly combined to give a surreal experience. It is a fast paced flick so there is no chance of getting bored at any stage. This is a good one. Definitely worth of your time!"
"JoeManko","1","123","227","13 August 2011"," Doesn't just insult your intelligence, it violently assaults it
","This movie doesn't just have plot holes, the whole thing IS one giant, gaping plot hole. There are too many nonsensical story elements to list, but here are the two biggest ones:<br/><br/>1 – What IS the source code exactly? <br/><br/>They say it creates alternate realities based on 8 minutes of a dead guy's memory. How can you create an entire fully-interactive alternate reality based on somebody's MEMORY? (Which is by definition something fixed that can't be changed or interacted with.) The whole idea just profoundly doesn't make sense on a fundamental level.<br/><br/>In fact, how do you create an alternate reality AT ALL? (Regardless of whether it's somehow based on a dead guy's memory or not.) They just toss that ability off casually, like it's no big deal: ""Oh yeah, we can create alternate realities now. Neat, huh? We're not going to explain it or even remotely get into the logic behind it""<br/><br/>Creating alternate realities and being able to recover the last 8 minutes of a corpse's memory are two concepts that have absolutely NOTHING inherently in common. It's just a sloppy juxtaposition of random junk sci-fi ideas.<br/><br/>2 – Why do both Stevens and his commanders think the person detonating the bomb is ON THE TRAIN WHEN IT BLOWS UP?!<br/><br/>Stevens spends almost all his time looking for the culprit on the train, primarily during the longer period after the last stop is made before the explosion hits, which makes absolutely no sense. Obviously the person responsible can't have blown himself up if they're so sure he's about to strike again later in the day.<br/><br/>If he had even basic deductive reasoning skills, Stevens would have always gotten off the train when it stopped and suspected only the people who got off with him. (And on a bigger level, no solid reason is ever given for why his commanders are so incredibly sure the suspect was even on the train ANYWHERE CLOSE to that 8 minute window he keeps visiting to begin with)<br/><br/>So in short: Not only does this movie make no sense, it doesn't even seem like it's TRYING to make sense. It just feels like the filmmakers are giving you the finger and yelling ""eat it, you morons!"" for the entire running time."
"imdb2-556-923983","1","85","161","7 May 2011"," Hollywood recycles
","Source Code has a powerful trailer, setting up some intriguing questions to be answered and hinting at three plots: inside the virtual reality, outside it, and an interplay between these two that should solve some crucial points. Unfortunately, the film itself contains absolutely nothing that isn't already in the trailer. I saw the film with my wife. She fell asleep in the middle, woke up half an hour later and asked me ""was he on the train again?"" to which I answered ""several times"". ""What did I miss?"" ""Absolutely nothing."" The whole movie is an exercise in wasting time by a screen-writer whose ideas ran out shortly after he thought up a great trailer (read: sales pitch. I can almost hear it: ""Inception meets Groundhog Day, and all happening entirely inside the Inner Space capsule!"". Unfortunately, other than recycling from the exceedingly overdone ""virtual reality"" movie genre, this film has nothing). There is only one plot: ""whodunit?"", and that plot progresses nowhere, and is finished when the question is answered by the first candidate the audience suspects, but the last the protagonist bothers checking. The ending of the movie, on the other hand, is so bad I dare not even blame the poor screenwriter. It must have been the work of a focus group. Whatever its source, it is lame and unconvincing. Do not expect any of the questions posed by the trailer to be answered. They are not.<br/><br/>I see this movie as an homage to Quantum Leap. The classic ""stranger in the mirror"" scene is featured, and even Scott Bakula is called in to deliver his famous ""Oh, boy"". (The scene where this happens is, itself, a testament to the emotional inconsistency of the film: the last thing the hero does is the one thing he keeps telling everybody he wants to do.)<br/><br/>My verdict: Quantum Leap deserves so much better than this."

","The US Army helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes in a commuter train to Chicago in the body of a professor named Sean Fentress, and his last memory is flying in Afghanistan. A woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) talks to him; there are minor incidents in the wagon and eight minutes later, the train blows-up.<br/><br/>Captain Stevens wakes up in a coffined in a sort of trunk and is contacted by the military Lieutenant Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). He learns that he had died in a helicopter crash and now he is inserted in a computer program called Source Code, developed by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), which transfers him to the body of a deceased person for the last eight minutes of his life using his after images. He is advised that he can not change the past, since Source Code is not a time machine, but he can reassign time and change the future. He is assigned to return to the train and find who the bomber is to avoid his next terrorist attack in Chicago downtown. Captain Stevens is sent back several times and he and Christina fall in love with each other. He decides to save the train from the explosion despite Dr. Rutledge tells him that that is effort is worthless.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer of ""Source Code"" a couple of months ago and I was anxiously waiting for its release on DVD in my country. Yesterday I saw it and the story is a flawed combination of several other films; despite of that, the film is engaging and works.<br/><br/>The character Captain Colter Stevens is visibly inspired in ""Johnny Got His Gun"" (1971) and his situation entering the body of someone else is the same of ""Avatar"" (2009) and ""Surrogates"" (2009), using the virtual concept of ""The Matrix"" (1999). The repetition of the same event over and over comes from ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) and ""12:01"" (1993). The different possibilities in timeline come from ""Przypadek"" (1981) and ""Sliding Doors"" (1998) and ""The Butterfly Effect"" (2004). Therefore, the writer Ben Ripley shows a great cinematographic culture in sci-fi and does the same that Quentin Tarantino does in action films, a rip-off that works.<br/><br/>The director Duncan Jones, from the best sci-fi of the Twentieth-First Century (""Lunar"") so far, makes another great film in his second work, supported by the excellent performances of Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright.<br/><br/>I watched this film with other viewers and in the end, we found two different interpretations for the conclusion of ""Source Code"". I believe that Captain Stevens has changed the timeline in the real world and the Source Code has never been used, in a time paradox. However, if my interpretation is right, Christina Warren should have been saved in one of Steven's attempt. The other interpretation is that he shifted his timeline to a parallel reality. No matter which interpretation is the correct one, everybody liked this very entertaining film. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Contra o Tempo"" (""Against the Time"")"

"gregmalone1","4","51","97","11 April 2011"," Lots of promise -- weak weak delivery
","Despite the generally rave reviews Source Code has gotten, I found it to be far less than I was expecting and wanting. <br/><br/>To get to the point, though I am a lifelong lover of science fiction, I tend to be put off by science fiction films where the ""science"" comes across as something conceived and explained by a poorly educated non-scientist grabbing buzz words out of thin air. Source Code falls apart in the ""science coherence"" realm for me, and thus I find the film fundamentally flawed. A side note to that, I had had the impression that Source Code was a 'time travel' story, but no, they put that hoped for idea to rest quickly by the lead ""scientist"" mumbling something about this *not* being time-travel but rather he gives a mumbo-jumbo-buzz-words-what- did-he-say lame and confusing explanation.<br/><br/>Then the film suffers from a terrible supporting cast. The cardboard cutout characters that communicate with the main character have as much depth and value as... cardboard. The lead scientist is a stereotype guy rummaging around in his lab coat being indifferent to his 'subject', while the military liaison that is the prime communicator with the main character is dealt a very poor script and no depth. By the time she does her ""save-the-hero"" act near the end, who cares.... there's been no establishment of character other than a face on a video monitor with no backstory (except a crumb near the end).<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the CGI... the train explosions and other effects --- which were minimal. A trained eye will quickly identify the CGI effects as being... budget oriented. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd save my $15 that it'll cost at the theater and wait for DVD or Netflix. Despite a good performance by Jake G., Source Code is a lame film, poorly written and directed without inspiration."

In fact, if you loved Deja Vu you'll probably still hate Source Code.<br/><br/>SC doesn't work on any level. The explanation of the sci-fi tech is lazy - it doesn't work hard enough to warrant the suspension of disbelief you'd need to invest yourself in the story.<br/><br/>The characters are so clichéd it's too embarrassing to even talk about them. Suffice it to say that they're phonier and more unbelievable than the quantum physics technobabble.<br/><br/>The hero finds the bomb in the first place he looks. Yawn. The bomber is the last person he suspects but the first person Hollywood would suspect. Yawn.<br/><br/>The super-secret, billion-dollar, experimental quantum physics project at an Air Force base is run by a nebbishy civilian professor, one technician, and Vera Farmiga. Groan.<br/><br/>Did Jake Gyllenhall change the past in his universe, the future in a parallel universe, or what? Who cares?<br/><br/>Howard Stern Tweeted about this movie ""it was great."" He is known for questionable taste in movies, so I wasn't sure what to do with that review. I figured going in that the lack of an exclamation point was intentional sarcasm. After seeing this turkey, I sure hope it was."

","OK so Gyllenhal is good in this movie. Lets get that out of the way first. Now onto the roast.<br/><br/>What a terrible steaming pile of dung this movie is. It simply makes NO sense. Lets examine the two possibilities for the ""world"" that they are operating in.<br/><br/>In the first, they have developed code that allows them to put a person's consciousness into the body of someone else in a mock-up of the world as it was at that time an infinite number of times. Fine - Where did this mock-up come from? They implied that it was from the the guy who Gyllenhal is inhabiting, but the train exploded... his brain would be peanut butter (along with everyone else on that train). OK so lets say magically his head got tossed away from the train and they retrieved it, how exactly does this guy manage to have complete knowledge of everything that exists in that world? He didn't go into the bathroom and open the ceiling and find the bomb there, so there would be nothing there in his version of the world. He either got off the train or stayed on it, so there's no way he could know what happened after the point that the train moved on. He might continue to believe that the Middle- Eastern stereotype guy was the terrorist - there's no way he could have any knowledge of what happened after those two events diverged. So of course, the virtual world example is ridiculous and makes no sense.<br/><br/>Alright so what about the idea that it is an alternate reality? This is even harder to believe. If its an alternate reality then of course there is no way to believe that the events would have unfolded in the same way as in the reality the movie takes place in. Every alternate would be different and none would reliably provide information about the reality of the movie. The guy that Gyllenhal ""inhabits"" maybe doesn't even exist in the alternate reality. Maybe he died of cancer. Maybe he works in Japan. Maybe he called in sick today. Who knows???<br/><br/>If its a virtual construct then all the information is already there, just parse the data. If its an alternate reality then by the definition of the word ALTERNATE you can't rely on it being even marginally similar to your reality. And if its time travel you could literally send him back an infinite number of times in succession. Just by the odds you would eventually get the data you needed by reading his brain (which is silly by itself, don't get me started...)<br/><br/>And then there is the annoying obfuscation that moves the plot along but is entirely unnecessary for the movie. There's no need to hide facts from Gyllenhal's character -- Just tell him what he's doing! There's no need to get his permission -- Just send him back! Why the writers play these stupid games with their audience I haven't a clue.<br/><br/>Stop being stupid movie-going zombies! Be critical! Ask questions!<br/><br/>If you keep consuming this kind of crap and saying its a filet mignon, the studios will continue to feed you CRAP."

","This movie shamelessly uses computer science (specifically computer programming) jargon (about 5-10 terms, like ""specification"", ""drivers"", ""Source Code"", etc) for a completely different purpose. For the kind of arrogant bullshit this movie presents (which is NOT science fiction, it's the new genre: bullshit fiction) it should be banned for reasons of subculture and attacking the sanctity of computer science, the most advanced and helpfull science we've got, the pinacle of civilization.<br/><br/>The dialog is complete bs, not just because of the misused jargon, but mainly because it tries hard to be militaristic and ""sf"" (trust me, it's actually bullshit fiction).<br/><br/>The special effects are not there. Even if the train crash is played repeatedly, it's just some fire covering the train, and lots of noise. That's about it. Nothing more to see. No train wrecks, no real accident. NOTHING.<br/><br/>The final scene tries to be something like the ""Matrix Effect"" with the camera moving around while everything is still. Unfortunately it is just a collage of people's pictures and the ""camera"" just zooms out (train background, people's pictures). It is so obvious, it shouldn't have been done. It's not 2011 worthy.<br/><br/>The plot is made of holes: - How can a human mind have enough information about every single corner on that train, including contents of books, or what's concealed in the ceiling (note that the attacked did not die in the train wreck)? - Even if we supposed that maybe they reconstructed the information from all the dead people, there still wouldn't be enough to ""mimic"" people's reactions (the information was reconstructed from a single person) - If the ""big bad quantic theory bullshit computer"" already had the information about the train and it's ""contents"", then it already knew where the bomb was. Why was it necessary for the wimpiest soldier ever in cinema to play with to find out where it was? -How in hell did the main character sent a SMS message from one parallel world to another (also there's a moral issue about taking that teacher's life/place - so he can be with that girl). -The nuclear ""bomb"" is so small (smaller than a little TV). Wtf, nuclear bombs are huge. They don't fit into a little box, and don't have Christmas lights on them.<br/><br/>There is a lot of propaganda about ""terrorism"" and it actually contains brain washing patriotic stuff like reasons for a soldier to die for his country (for example, it is told to the soldier, that he must stay alive and keep fighting (searching) so he can serve his country, by finding out where bomb which will kill the entire city of Chicago).<br/><br/>The soundtrack, the acting, the camera moves and general pace of the movie try to create a state of suspense. It did work for idiots, didn't work for the rest of the audience (you don't want to know the kind of people like the movie, I interrogated a lot, and really, only complete idiots).<br/><br/>Please stop making movies like these. At least invent your own words for the kind of bs you present. When I heard ""charge the drivers"" I was gonna leave the cinema, too bad I was with someone else."

At some point we learn that ""some part"" of the main character's brain is ""still functioning"". It would be absolutely impossible to undertake the complex cognitive tasks he does with just ""some part"" of his brain. Etc, etc. <br/><br/>As for the ""meaning"", what was it supposed to be? That we should learn to care about every moment of our lives? That there exist worlds parallel to ours? That we should love our neighbors? Whatever it was, it's an utter cliché.

","okay so i thought i would clear this up for most of you. the ending isn't about creating the alternate universes but what they are doing is changing the time line.<br/><br/>at the end when the guy tells Dr. Rutledge (the inventor of source code) that the terrorist attack on the train has been stopped and he says ""one of these days the right crisis is going to rear its head and source code is going to have its moment in the sun"" which means that the inventor doesn't really understand whats going on in reality source code always works every time without fail but they never remember that it works because when it does work and they attack is stopped they do not have start the source code program.<br/><br/>that is that the text at the end is about the really Sean sends Goodwin the text telling her when they start the source code up to tell colter that he will be okay this is also why she is confused because in the real time line Sean figures out how to disarm the bomb, handcuffs the terrorist to the train, and calls he police (he knows all of this because of the source code from the time line that is portrayed throughout almost all of the movie) after that he walks off with his girlfriend (or friend w/e) which is why they never know he was the real one that actually saved everyone<br/><br/>which kinda brings it into loop because now the attack is stopped they will wait till then next attack arises where they can use it, which they will and they will succeed again change the time line and not need to use source code till the next attack.<br/><br/>in summary source code always changes the time line so basically it always works and they never have to use it.<br/><br/>another way you could think of it is that colter from separate time lines gives 8 minutes of memories to people filled with information to stop terrorist attacks. the Sean on the train would suddenly have memories from a serperate time line that the train explodes so he had have the ability to stop it. this is what colter is doing to people<br/><br/>personally what i would like to know is does Goodwin frequently receive texts from random numbers telling her to tell colter hes going to be okay when they start the program and that source code works better than they know<br/><br/>after receiving many of these texts from random people who no way could know about the classified project she must eventually figure out that source code is always working because all terrorist attacks would stop completely and she would be receiving these texts every time the program worked and the time line was changed"

","A tired movie begets a tired movie review.<br/><br/>Look, I just left this film feeling like somewhere, some tiny speck of original thought crept into the screenwriter's head when he was writing this movie: The film does make the audience think. A brain puzzle in the same vein as the (much) superior ""Inception"", this film just constantly reminds the viewer how we are in the hands of mediocre talents who are too lazy to see an idea through and rely upon tired concepts to caulk together a story. <br/><br/>There is no need to poke holes in the pseudo-science surrounding the out-of-body concept employed in Source Code; it is immediately self- contradictory as our protagonist wanders into areas (train station, other train cars) that his host never did and therefore could not have known for Colter to experience. Unlike Inception, which doggedly follows its own rules of dreams, the world of this film writes, breaks, and re-writes the rules.<br/><br/>But this really isn't the biggest problem with the movie. The biggest problem is the ridiculous and ham-fisted approach Colter takes to finding the bomber. He thuggishly roughs up a variety of passengers, wasting the viewer's time with red herring after red herring. Our director wastes a golden opportunity to weave one hell of a whodunit and instead spends precious time trying to develop a love story nobody gives a hoot about.<br/><br/>I do not feel that I know anything more about these characters at the end of the film as I do at the beginning and I certainly don't care about them any more either. What could have been the emotional high point of the film, a phone call that Colter places to his father, is handled so poorly that I threw in the towel and just waited for the lights to come on."

","""Source Code"" isn't even vaguely plausible. I try not to overthink sci-fi spitballing, but even the most preposterous premises should adhere to an implicit rule set. Based on a screenplay by Ben Ripley, who previously authored two direct-to-DVD ""Species"" flicks, this lazy follow- up to director Duncan Jones' understated 2009 character study ""Moon"" is a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Steeped in pseudo-science, ""Source Code's"" biggest fault is its failure to adequately explain the parameters of the titular alternate reality experiment. Through vague governmental computer wizardry, Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is uploaded into the body of a civilian aboard an ill-fated Chicago-bound commuter train and tasked with locating a rigged explosive and its owner. To complicate matters, he only has eight minutes until impact and it's back to start.<br/><br/>So begins a trial and error rescue mission—not to save the train itself, but to identify the culprit and avert a looming second attack. If you're already confused, don't sweat it—Stevens is too. After every botched attempt, he finds himself back in a dank isolation room harnessed into an enormous machine with a video link to his commanding officers. As he probes them for more information on his mission, he also pries out the requisite exposition about the tech.<br/><br/>Long story short, Source Code isn't time travel. It merely relocates Stevens' consciousness into the lingering memory trail of the recently deceased. Cool, right? The problem is that such a heady concept immediately opens itself to a thousand potential plot holes. For instance, if Stevens is reliving the terminal eight minutes of someone's life, why can he exit the train at random when the body and mind he's sharing has no frame of reference for it? How does he even know what the passengers two cars over look like?<br/><br/>Even if you buy into the flawed logic of ""Source Code,"" the filmmaking just isn't up to snuff. Jones throws subtlety to the wind for this antithetical take on the genre he seemed so passionate for two years ago. He imbues the proceedings with a nondescript glossy veneer and achieves unanimously stilted performances from his cast. Character actor Jeffrey Wright comes away looking especially bad, but Gyllenhaal is also mismanaged in the lead.<br/><br/>It isn't their fault; Jones lacks vision and Ripley lacks talent. The latter in particular seems incapable of executing on even his better ideas interestingly. By his hand, Stevens' lame bomb-sniffing stratagem boils down to blindly badgering suspicious-looking commuters and eventually lucky guesswork. Maybe some will respond to his common sense approach, but I much prefer watching characters more clever than myself weasel their way out of trouble. For all his military training, Captain Stevens might as well have been Joe Average Passenger.<br/><br/>A far cry from the careful construction of Duncan Jones' offbeat debut, ""Source Code"" is a discouragingly impersonal film shellacked with Hollywood disinfectant. Worse, it's plain bad science fiction. It's a halfhearted amalgam of films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Inception,"" hold the fresh perspective. Still, I'm not ready to count Jones out. The young director had a hand in fleshing out ""Moon,"" and will hopefully creatively contribute more to future projects. However, as it stands, his first two features couldn't be more at odds. Taken alone, ""Source Code"" is a misfire; given that it's the sophomore effort of so promising a talent, it's a major missed opportunity."

Aside from reeking of been-there-done-that syndrome, this film is reminiscent of the Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) episode ""Cause and Effect"" in which the Enterprise was caught in a time loop in which it kept getting destroyed until the crew sussed out how to avert the tragedy. ""Source Code,"" in similar fashion repeats an 8-minute event on a train before its destruction as a result of a terrorist bombing.<br/><br/>Unlike the STTNG episode that featured characters that fans (read as: Yours Truly) grew to know and love, the ""Source Code"" cast is unfamiliar and underdeveloped just enough for me to absolutely not care about them or their predicament.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal does a serviceable job as the confused, reluctant protagonist, and though I love Vera Farmiga, she simply doesn't have that much to do here.

","An unfortunate rule in science fiction is that you have to explain the world. Thus, you have to maintain three story lines. One is the story that you give the viewers to get them from where they are to where the film is. Usually, the filmmaker either calls up a genre shorthand or invokes an all-powerful military or corporate force.<br/><br/>A second story involves the mechanics of that world as they develop through the film. Here, the mechanics are simple: you have the real world (of the movie) and an eight minute entry into quantum parallel worlds sharing a common event. As the story progresses, a human mind powered by love is able to shift the layers of that quantum reality. Okay.<br/><br/>The third story is what we allow ourselves to register, be it a romance or redemption story — or one of the very few other options in the sellable storybag. <br/><br/>The goal of a talented storyteller (at least in this market) is to enhance the engagement in that third story by folding the second and possibly the first by some shared structure. Think of ""50 First Dates"" which successfully merged all three and teased us into investing in the romance beyond the barriers we normally would erect.<br/><br/>Now this. These three story threads coexist in the same ninety minutes, but otherwise they are distinct. The first is a cheat: military technology don't ya know.<br/><br/>The second is also a cheat of sorts because the parallel quantum folds aren't used narratively. We have the faint impress of a detective searching, plus some explosions. Chicago is made safe (in one of the parallel realities, but not the one we started in).<br/><br/>The third story is perhaps the biggest cheat of all, the romance: boy falls in love and gets the girl. But how? Why? There is no seduction, no pull, no engagement between them or between the couple and us.<br/><br/>""Inception"" is sometimes criticized for being sterile. It wasn't for me because I was able to ignore Hans Zimmer's hospital machine drone, and surf the resonances among the three stories and their surprises. ""Groundhog Day"" was a success because of its uncomplicated harmony among the three (the first alluding to camera magic).<br/><br/>This is a disaster.

Where is the bomb? Is it here? Oh.. it was. Well, who's the villain then? Is it, perhaps, this guy? It was? Uh, okay.<br/><br/>The love story is equally unconvincing. Remember, we're talking about a romance that develops a total of eight minutes. There's no real reason for them to fall in love either. Colter apparently started liking her just because they sat opposite to each other. The love story is thus also a sideshow.<br/><br/>The sci-fi parts are unconvincing and worse, illogical.

In the last 10 minutes, all of the logic and rules that the movie has been building up so far get completely thrown out the window for no good reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>Instead of letting Colter have his last moments of peace before an inevitable death (effectively making a point that we all must die someday, so you might as well make your last moments beautiful and worth dying for), the movie takes an absurd leap into nonsense. Apparently this ending - though beautiful and powerful - would've been too dark, so instead Colter somehow jumps to an alternate universe, where he takes over the body of another man (effectively killing him in the process, but the movie ignores this moral dilemma) and somehow nothing bad actually happened.<br/><br/>Somehow Colter was right all along and you *can* alter the laws and timelines of the universe with the love of an imagined 8-minute romance, and to top it all off, he sends an e-mail from his dream to a real cell phone in an alternate universe.<br/><br/>What point is the movie trying to make here, exactly?<br/><br/>Nothing makes any sense.

"hitchcockthelegend","9","7","11","19 August 2011"," Source Code is not time travel. Source Code is time reassignment.
","Source Code is directed by Duncan Jones and written by Ben Ripley. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. Music is by Chris P. Bacon and cinematography by Don Burgess. <br/><br/>U.S. Military helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) repeatedly relives the eight minutes leading up to a terrorist train bombing in the hope of finding the bomber <br/><br/>With his excellent first film, Moon, Duncan Jones got himself noticed to the point that many sci-fi fans have been eagerly awaiting his next foray into the sci-fi realm. So some pressure, then, on Source Code to make good on that early promise. Leaving space, Jones is this time on Earth tackling a sub-genre that has had many an instalment over the years, the time travel thinker. How wonderful to report that Jones and his sparkling team have crafted one of the better efforts to tackle the subject.<br/><br/>Off the bat it has to be said that it's easy to draw comparisons to a number of movies that Source Code leans on. Be it the continuous comedy time loop of Groundhog Day, the techno mind meld of Déjà Vu, and thematic snatches from the likes of The Matrix and Frequency, Jones' film is not about to herald a new dawn of sci-fi. Yet all these things have amazingly come together to create one large intellectually satisfying whole. Sprinkle on some action adrenalin rushes, ease in some suspense, some heart tugging and a romantic thread that actually belongs! Well you have got yourself a very tasty piece of pie. <br/><br/>That Jones is able to blend all this without halting the flow of his picture marks him out as one who is ready for the big league. We are after all dealing with a film that for 90% of its run time is replaying an 8 minute train ride. But each 8 minutes brings more to the plot, tension mounts, clues are dangled, characters come alive, yet we know that this train still goes kaboom, the hopeless feel that accompanies the destiny of Colter and the train passengers adds another critical element to why Source Code is top stuff, namely is it possible for Colter to go against the laws of quantum physics? He believes so, he desperately wants to save everyone on that train, but logic and his superiors tells him, and us, otherwise. <br/><br/>None of this would work if the casting wasn't so astute. Having to carry the film firmly on his shoulders, Gyllenhaal is fantastic, showing vast range with every 8 minute section of that train ride. From the confusion that brings out neurosis in the early parts, to the manic and steely determination to succeed in the latter stages, he nails it as a flawed, scared, soldier of hope. Monaghan's natural attractiveness and earthy appeal really serves her character well, making it easy for us to not only want her to not get blown to bits, again and again, but also to believe that Colter wants to succeed so desperately so as to save her. Farmiga is in a small role (arguably just a plot set up), and mostly in close ups via a screen, but she makes good as the icy stickler for orders who begins to melt with Colter's desperate situation. <br/><br/>The liability is Wright, who seems to be pitching his role as the Source Code creator between evil genius and pompous prat! I've no idea what accent he is trying to do and he blatantly tries to steal the film in every scene he is in. You have to think that had someone like Ridley Scott or James Cameron been directing, such thick ham slicing would have been reined in. Jones will learn one would think. Chris Bacon's (conductor-I Am Legend) score is suitably Hitchcockian, Don Burgess' (Contact/Spider-Man/The Book of Eli) photography is genre compliant and it's nice to see some Illinois land marks feature. All that and there's even a very notable (homage) voice cameo in there as well. <br/><br/>Even paying off on further viewings, Source Code is a must see for the genre fan. A thriller with heart, a sci-fi with brains, and an action film as well. 9/10"

","Source Code is one of the most disappointing moves I have ever seen in the theater.Well what to expect from Jake Gyllenhall , a wannabe movie star whose all top grossing movies have been all supporting roles to more accomplished movie actors like Heath Ledger and Anne Hathaway.The movie started promisingly, with its Vantage point like sequences where the director would revert to the original scene repeatedly. I was so disgusted with the ending which failed to convey any logic and give us an unbelievably stupid happy ending.My question is how the hell could he have not died...he was dead for god sakes...I cannot stomach it..getting the bad guy was one thing but to save everyone aboard and then come back to life was absolute crap.How dare the director make us watch a movie which built on a premise that he was dead and suitably change the concept of the so called' source code' and bring him back to life with the notion that he can ultimately change the fate by altering a few circumstances.Rubbish!! What to happened to the guy whose body he assumed , everyone else was saved but that poor guy was discarded and the director made Jake assume his place and get his girl friend , If he saved everyone how the hell does he explain that guy not coming back to life.Science fiction I understand but IT Totally DEFIES LOGIC...If he just assumed the guys body, what happened to that guy's soul or inner self..it is a gross injustice to the teacher horrible.It would have been more believable if he could have saved everyone including the teacher and HE remained dead..."

","Science Fiction is supposed to explore the unknown areas of science, not contradict common sense. Source Code talks about capturing the ""afterglow"" of a dead person's brain activity through synaptic mapping. This is an interesting idea to explore, but how can anyone create even simulated experiences that the dead person *didn't* have, such as going into the conductor's office or a station and parking lot adjacent to the train? Second, how did the project scientists get this synaptic map, when the dead person was blown to bits by an massive explosion just 10 feet away from him, leaving nothing by splattered gray matter? <br/><br/>(spoiler alert) Third, if only ""certain parts"" of Stevens' brain were alive, they would have to be the parts involved in comprehension of speech, production of speech, seeing and complex thinking. Yet, in the scene where the audience sees where probes have been inserted into Stevens' brain, *none* of those areas were wired up. Not to mention that there were no visible signs for nutrients or other life support required for Stevens' body.<br/><br/>If I could find these ridiculous flaws in 30 minutes after the film, the filmmakers should have thought of them months in advance of making the film. I hate ""syfy"" whose core premises insults its viewers' intelligence."

","MAJOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>An intriguing set-up which promises a lot until the villain shows up. He's an American patriot. You know, the kind that's always blowing things up. To make matters worse Gyllenhaal at first follows two Islamic guys, one middle Eastern, the other white, who both turn out to be innocent, as if to say in the usual lazy Hollywood way ""see, see, we are confronting your prejudices here."" If only they would confront their own prejudices. <br/><br/>In modern Hollywood the villain comes in three varieties 1. White patriots. 2. White capitalists. 3. A combination of 1 and 2. Why is it that Hollywood now seems incapable of dealing with any idea of evil which doesn't include these categories? Its not as though the world is not furnishing enough examples of terror to write about. Yet as daily examples of Islamic/communist/ecological violence greet us, Hollywood is more and more engaging in fantasies where not only is this not happening but the choice of villain is the least likely to commit them. Its as though the Hollywood of 1944, instead of making films about spies and fifth columnists, made ordinary Americans the real threat. <br/><br/>For those not ideologically minded (ie the majority of the audience) the problem is not the leaden agenda but the utter predictability of it all by now. The brief thought that an Islamic terrorist might appear (for once) in a mainstream movie only serving the accentuate the crushing deflation when it turns out to be the same old. I expect huge groans for cinemas when the sucker punch hits them ""Not again!"" Which will turn to anger as they realise (yet again) that Hollywood and the critics have conspired to churn out something utterly insulting to its audience as ""intelligent"". Its a pity, since this film has pretensions to be a thinking sci-fi thriller."

"melancholykeith","9","6","10","10 May 2011"," Quantum Leap + Groundhog Day + Universal Soldier = Source Code **Spoliers**
","I have wanted a Quantum Leap movie for some time and it appears at this point in time (barring miracles) this is the closest I am going to get. The similarities are that the hero is traveling (not back in time, the boss of the project makes that very clear) to figure out who bombed a train, admittedly yes it not as grandiose a purpose as putting right what once went wrong but the mirror effect of seeing who the hero (Colter) has ""leaped"" into and the Swiss cheesed memory are both pure QL. Scott Bakula even has a voice only (damn director!) cameo as the hero's dad, even fitting in an ""oh boy!"" for good measure. Groundhog Day because the hero is re-living the same situation over and over again, while trying to figure out who the villain is,their plans and how to stop them. Universal Soldier because the hero is a dead pilot who is in one way or another re-animated and is being sent into a situation to fix things. Admittedly he is not a former commando but the parallel between Source Code and Universal Soldier is clearly there. Overall it is a great movie, worthy of 9 out of 10, some reviewers have criticized the happy ending but I think it works better with this ending rather Colter's memory being wiped so he could continue to be used for more source code missions in the future. The downside was by the 2nd leap onto the train I had figured out who the villain was, which in retrospect is kind of easy when you think about it. But if you don't pick it up, then there is still enough suspense to keep you watching until the end."
"DICK STEEL","10","5","8","16 April 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Source Code
","With the number of remakes and reboots and adaptations going around Hollywood, it isn't everyday that a film emerges with something relatively original and creative, except perhaps for the science fiction genre when it creates its own rules to play by. Duncan Jones proves he's no fluke with Moon, coming up with an equally entertaining and engaging Source Code that has Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role as military man Colter Stevens who finds himself in a groundhog day type of situation, tasked with a mission of investigating and stopping a bomb from exploding on a commuter train headed for Chicago, failing which he has to ""die"" together with its passengers, again and again.<br/><br/>The less said about the film, the better because letting slip any plot points no matter how minor would be a huge disservice to an audience. Suffice to say that Stevens has to achieve his mission objectives in a race against time, all 8 minutes of it, based upon a program created by Jeffrey Wright's Dr Rutledge that taps on the final collective memories of victims in any disaster, where an investigator can somehow find himself in the body of one of the victims and be at the recreated scene of the crime, interacting in a simulated environment to discover clues and of course, perpetrators. It's an extremely sexy scenario that provides a leg up in any investigations should something along the same lines get translated to reality - imagine scores of crime being solved, and being a powerful tool in the fight against terrorism.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays his character with aplomb, resigning to knowing he cannot get answers from his handler Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) unless he delivers with each cycle some intelligence and findings, while at the same time getting attracted to Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) through the identity he assumes. The love story snuck in was a nice little touch, as does the backstory of who Stevens is, and how he gets himself into where and what he is currently into now. Things start to pick up when Stevens becomes situationally aware and desires to take control over his own fate.<br/><br/>The visual effects here didn't go overboard and Jones knows exactly the limits required before they take over and overshadow the strength of the story. It's less gimmicky, with more detail to attention given to the host of supporting characters and series of events going inside the train, and covering a lot more aspects of the expansive simulated world that addresses some of the major issues that could have made plot loopholes, but thankfully didn't.<br/><br/>But the downside which I prefer to overlook because it doesn't detract the viewer from the experience, involves accepting the reality that the filmmakers present to you. If you do not buy into the paradox of time travel, then you won't enjoy any time travel movies, and the same applies here if you aren't a big fan of alternate realities - there's the world that everyone exists in the main narrative, and a recreated digital one that is used for investigations purposes, defined to exist only within the specified limits of an event centered around 8 minutes worth, and no direct line exists between the real world and the recreated one, except perhaps to send one into, and retrieve one out of.<br/><br/>The other minor disappointment involves what I thought to be pressures existing to have a Hollywoodized ending that perhaps would be more acceptable to mainstream audiences. There's a moment in time in the final act that would have closed the film nicely given the moral conscience and decency to provide proper closure, and I felt it would have been pitch perfect rather than to push the realm of an alternate reality even further. There has bound to be a cheat sheet somewhere that the story by Ben Ripley decided to pull out to allow scenes to run and continue into the final few minutes that were quite unnecessary, if only to wrap things up in a more hopeful, and expectedly straightforward manner. Some implausibilities that broke its own rules on collective memories however do provide for post-movie discussion, especially if one's stance were to centre around one of the most powerful abilities of the mind known as imagination, and the desires to hear just what one wants to.<br/><br/>Still, Source Code belongs up there amongst contemporary science fiction stories that leaves you engrossed and engaged with every repeated cycle and turn in the story, and with excellent cast chemistry making it worth the ride. It presents something that isn't done to death already with that tinge of science fiction that looks like an attractive proposition to create in our world. Highly recommended as it goes into my shortlist of the best movies of the year thus far."

","Source Code is a science-fiction mystery film set in modern day Chicago and a government facility in an unknown place. This is one of those movies that will make you think hard trying to figure out what is reality and what isn't. Unless you pay close attention to what's happening, you can easily get confused and lost. It is thus somewhat comparable to The Matrix and Inception. As you might expect, the sci-fi aspect of this film was totally ridiculous, unrealistic and unscientific. The mystery or whodunit aspect could've been more suspenseful and could've used some twists and turns to keep you guessing. If you watch carefully, it is fairly obvious near the beginning of the movie who the bomber was. Overall, this is an above average sci-fi film that is worth watching."
"Quebec_Dragon","6","3","4","28 January 2012"," How thinking too much can almost ruin an otherwise decent flick
","At its simplest, this seems to be the story of a guy reliving the last 8 minutes of someone else on a train over and over before it explodes. How and why is for you to discover. I had a peculiar experience watching this film. At first, I was quite engrossed by the mystery element and the paranoia of what's going on and who's responsible. However, as time went on, I kept being taken out of the picture. My sense of disbelief was hurt because I was finding big logical flaws. I was left dissatisfied and frustrated. However, after reading more about the Source Code concept and the ending online, it seems I was unfair about the logical flaws. The problem is that it's implied, and you assume, it takes place in someone's else memories and/or some kind of virtual reality based on those. As such, our hero shouldn't be able to discover certain things because the person he's in doesn't know them because he never saw them. It's worse when the camera shows you other people without the hero there. If he's not there, how does he know that's happening? So, my big piece of advice for enjoyment of the movie is not to dwell too much on the science explanation part, that in my opinion was lacking. It's probably not what you might think or even what the main scientist thinks. Check on the Internet afterwards to understand as I did.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, let's write about the rest. I thought the directing was excellent with dynamic camera movement in rather small enclosed environments (the train and somewhere else). The recurring fire explosion in slow-motion was sometimes quite artistic. The story was good with nice suspense (despite the repeating), a few very good twists and a few far-fetched occurrences. The science aspect should have been explained better. The main character was acted very well by Gyllenhaal. He excels at playing distress, uncertainty and anxiety. The leading actress was quite fetching and likable, making for good chemistry. The train passengers were unfortunately mostly cardboard-thin (why was it mostly men?). We weren't made to care for them. It's not a special effects heavy movie. It starts as thriller, then veers toward drama and romance. I wasn't really moved by any of it, but I liked the romantic aspect. I didn't care about the ending as it felt like a focus audience consensus, and at that point, I thought it didn't make any sense (unfairly so). The product placement was really irritating. All in all, I think it's an enjoyable movie that I'd have liked more if my brain hadn't picked (mostly unfair) holes in it while watching.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)"

","Yeah..I know. I know. I'll get heat for this one, but Source Code is so much better than and the movie I thoroughly expected from Inception.<br/><br/>Was it the hype for Inception I heard for the two months it took me to see that after it was released? Eh, I can get past that. And Inception wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't impress me than this admittedly smaller, but more entertaining sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes on a train headed towards Chicago and he's unsure how he got there. (I can relate, but mine's usually an unfamiliar beduh) And within eight minutes, the whole thing explodes! And that's just within the first eight minutes of the movie!<br/><br/>Next, Colter awakes in a pod with Colleen Goodwin (played the always fantastic Vera Farmiga) asking him questions on a screen while telling him his ""frivolous"" inquires on where he is/why he's there are irrelevant and he's wasting time. Well, if you didn't know how you got on a train one minute and in a pod the next and you thought you were supposed to be serving your country in Afghanistan – oh, I left that part out: he's a soldier – then you might be a bit puzzled yourself.<br/><br/>And repeat. He's constantly sent back to the train scene where his ""mission"" is to find out who's the mad bomber within eight minutes so Colleen and her military gang can prevent another attack – one that's actually in downtown Chicago. Only, we've sent a human to do a computer's job, à la: the Robocop syndrome. He falls for Christina Warren (played by – again – the always fantastic Michelle Monaghan – I wish we could see more of her), a woman Colter keeps seeing once he's ""magically"" transported back onto the train while he's inhibiting a body of a victim who's fate will be sealed (yet again) in eight minutes.<br/><br/>There's a lot more, and it would be hard to write a synopsis without blatant spoilers. Suffice to say, expect a lot of twists and on the edge of your seat suspense, EVEN when they supposedly solved the ""problem."" Literally, even though the movie could've ended 15 minutes before the finale, I was still on edge because humans always seem to mess things up, even when they ""won."" And lo, I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the conclusions.<br/><br/>Much like Moon, Director Duncan Jones made such a ""small"" film seem so large. I can absolutely see this making only a third of what Inception made, and that's okay. Avatar made TRILLIONS (not really, but anything over $100 million was unjustified) and that doesn't make that anywhere near the top of hardly anyone's best movies lists. I can absolutely see this movie making my own top ten of 2011 (at least.) And it's so short that, it's an easy movie to watch repeatedly.<br/><br/>Strictly for entertainment purposes only, Source Code, a more serious and more relevant (for today's time) Groundhog Day experiment, is a must-see. The performances of the two leading ladies were very good and Jake – eh – was still good, but the idea, originality, twists, fun and absolute suspense make this a train ride everyone should be all-aboard. (Dang, that was cheesy. Hope that doesn't make the poster and deter viewers)"

","Military helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself on a train, talking to Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who thinks he is someone else. After some minutes of confusing conversation, the train is involved in an explosion and crash, and Stevens wakes up in a capsule in conversation over a video link with Captain Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). It turns out that Stevens is involved in the Source Code project which enables him to be sent back into target Sean Fentress to relive 8 minutes leading up to the terrorist explosion, in order to find out who the terrorist is in order to prevent a second atrocity.<br/><br/>To thumbnail review this film, let me simply say that it is a superior science fiction suspense thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend it.<br/><br/>I am now entering serious spoiler territory.<br/><br/>It doesn't take much to work out - as he does about halfway through - that Stevens is actually, to all intents and purposes, dead. It is made clear that his 8-minute trips back don't actually change anything - the atrocity has already taken place - but real time is slipping by, and the time left to apprehend the terrorist is limited. However, Stevens badly wants to save Chistina's life despite the fact that she is already dead.<br/><br/>This film has two endings. There is an ending which uses what is essentially a bullet time freeze frame tracking shot, and this is the ideal place at which to have ended the film: it is fair and faithful to what came before. And then a further end is tacked on. It's OK, I suppose, but the only way it works in the context of the science fiction explored in the earlier part of the movie is if it takes place in a parallel time line/reality. This has been mentioned, but not really put forward as part of the basis on which the plot stands and is therefore, I felt, slightly unfair. However, it is a happy ending for the masses, so I suppose one can't complain.<br/><br/>Even so, this is a pretty good movie - engaging, thoughtful and it has heart. All the principals are good."

","Jake Gyllenhaal fleshes out the characters he portrays, and rightfully makes it his own. Whether it's Donnie Darko or Zodiac, he ups the ante. This is absolutely the case in Source Code. Think Groundhog Day meets the best sci-fi you can think of. Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a soldier who's forced to use the Source Code: repeating a real-life train journey to Chicago, and its eventual explosion and the death of everyone on board. His mission is to find the bomb and its detonator. The investigation's only half the hoot. On the train opposite Stevens (who's in someone else's body on the train) is Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a beautiful, down-to-earth woman that knows the person Stevens has 'taken over'. Colter's subconscious actions bring them closer together, but is it a relationship destined to fail the moment he enters the Source Code? Only 8 minutes of time will tell, as director Duncan Jones successfully balances romance (or not time-travelling) with heart-stopping action."

","I've just finished watching it and it really brought me to a different reality,I couldn't see anything else until it was over, it was that kind of a movie. great job to the actors & to the one who wrote that script! I would love to see more movies like this one, and I love the idea of parallel worlds where anything can happen, it makes you wonder.. The concept of the movie is quite new, never seen it in movies before and I think that's exactly what people are looking for - it enriches our imagination. To think beyond the limits and to believe that death is not the end - these are two of most important ideas from this movie (please excuse my English, still learning)."
"agmoldham","4","4","6","3 May 2011"," Not very much originality to be found here
","I had heard a couple of very good reviews of Source Code, but must confess to being slightly disappointed with it myself.<br/><br/>Source Code tells the story of a Colter Stevens who is placed onto a train that is about to be blown up in 8 minutes. Colter Stevens takes on another persons identity when he is placed on the train. He must solve the crime in order that a follow up crime can be averted. He is repeatedly placed back on the train to see if he can work out who is behind the plot.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a bit too old to buy into a plot like this, so consequently I could never warm to the film. I am a big fan of Jake Gyllanhaal and he can't be faulted for his performance in Source Code. The same can also be said for Michelle Monaghan who certainly brightens the mood as his girlfriend on the train. The interplay between the two leads certainly bears comparison with a similar situation in Groundhog Day."

"secondtake","7","6","11","20 May 2011"," Well made and fast paced, but a little been there done that and a little too improbable
","Source Code (2011)<br/><br/>It's easy to say this could have been a great movie, because it has some great elements, but it's also easy to notice how derivative the basic ideas are, too. And so this is a decent thriller with lots of issues left hanging. I think some people will totally love it, especially if they haven't seen, or maybe if they have, the inspirations for it.<br/><br/>That is, the structure of the film is a series of variations on a single set of events, returned to over and over with twists and alternatives explored, many of them imaginative. A very differently styled predecessor is ""Run Lola Run"" but I think ""Source Code"" is a more direct echo of recent American films like ""Momento"" or ""Vantage Point."" It's a little like ""Inception"" meets ""Groundhog Day,"" actually, and that's not all bad.<br/><br/>The main character who is reliving (or seeming to) the main event, the blowing up of a Chicago commuter train, is a war veteran played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's good, very good, if not astonishing (you might consider Bruce Willis in ""Twelve Monkeys"" for a definition close to astonishing, believe it or not). The talking head (mostly seen on a video screen) that helps him through his various incarnations is Vera Farmiga, always a trustworthy presence on screen. Everyone else, from the terrific scientist in the background (Jeffrey Wright) to the bland but serviceable girl and would be girlfriend (Michelle Monaghan) are support to the main pair, or even just to Gyllenhaal, who carries the show.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is eye popping effects, high tension whodunnit terrorism, and interior soul searching in a sci-fi kind of superficial way. It's fine, but it's been done better before. And there are some logic bending requirements that you can go along with most of the time, but reluctantly. By the last few minutes, when there is one ridiculous last twist, it's just a matter of saying, loudly, ""Whatever."" <br/><br/>This is almost the definition of a summer blockbuster--well made, fast, undemanding, interesting, fleeting. And it's a month early, so maybe there are more decent things to come."

","Nice science fiction thriller with good performances by the actors, worthwhile to see this in the theater.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal seems to have hit his stride lately, picking good roles that suit him with the last couple of movies he has starred in. He does well here, as a reluctant hero who starts to piece together what is really going on in a mission to discover the details of a terror plot and identity of the terrorist in Chicago.<br/><br/>The film is shot in an intelligent style, giving brief but significant snippets of various characters on board a commuter train and red herrings tossed in liberally to keep you guessing.<br/><br/>It's not that original or groundbreaking, but made with high standards and care to give the movie-goer good value for their dollar and a pleasant entertainment that delivers on expectations.

","The concept of afterlife has fascinated man for eons. In this film after the human body expires, there is residual electrical energy in the brain and an 8 minute long short term memory record.<br/><br/>Enter the source code: a time loop program that allows the subject to take over another deceased persons body in a reenactment of their last eight minutes of life.<br/><br/>Full Plot: Colter Stevens, a decorated army helicopter pilot, suddenly wakes up on a train sitting across from a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). The woman seems to know him by the name Sean Fentress, but he doesn't seem to know her. After eight minutes, a bomb goes off on the train, and he awakens to find himself strapped inside a small geodesic dome.<br/><br/>There, Air Force Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains to him through a computer screen that he is now on a mission to locate the maker of a bomb which destroyed a train headed into Chicago.<br/><br/>Stevens has no memory of how he became involved in the Source Code project; his last memory is of flying in a recent mission in Afghanistan while taking on enemy gunfire. Stevens' mission in the Source Code is to assume the identity of Fentress, one of the train's passengers, locate the bomb, discover who detonated it, and report back to Goodwin to prevent the bomber from detonating a larger nuclear device in downtown Chicago, which could cause the deaths of millions of people. Goodwin and the Source Code's creator, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), tell him that the Source Code is not a simulation, but a visit into the past in the form of an alternate reality. He's told that he cannot truly alter the past to save any of the passengers, but that he must gather intel that can be used to alter the future and prevent a future attack. Goodwin assures Stevens that ""everything will be OK."" Stevens is sent into the Source Code repeatedly, and each time a series of events repeat, with variations due to Stevens' acts. Meanwhile, he goes on searching for the terrorist and getting to know Christina, until the bomb that destroys the train goes off and Fentress dies, sending Stevens back to the chamber.<br/><br/>Even though Rutledge and Goodwin constantly direct him to focus on finding the bomber, each time around he learns more, both about the terrorist attack and his real life personal situation. Stevens resolves to complete his mission, now with the added personal goal of saving Christina and the people on the train if at all possible.<br/><br/>Using a cellphone while on the train, Stevens eventually discovers that he supposedly died two months ago. He confronts Goodwin with this information, and learns from Goodwin and Rutledge that he had been shot down during the war, and his mutilated body was appropriated by the Air Force and used by Rutledge to operate the Source Code. Stevens then asks Rutledge and Goodwin to let him die, which they promise they will do once the mission is finished.<br/><br/>He eventually discovers that the bomber is a disturbed American young man named Derek Frost (Michael Arden), which allows authorities to apprehend Frost and save Chicago before the second bomb is detonated.<br/><br/>With the mission accomplished, and despite their promise, Rutledge orders Stevens' memory to be erased and stored for reuse in further missions. However, Stevens persuades Goodwin to send him in one more time and give him one last chance to avert the train disaster. Goodwin agrees that he deserves to be allowed to die in peace afterwards instead of being held alive as a military brain in a vat.<br/><br/>With the information he has uncovered from previous trips into the Source Code, Stevens is able to defuse the bomb and immobilize Frost before he can destroy the train.<br/><br/>Stevens and Christina kiss in the last seconds before the eight-minute mark. In that instant, Goodwin turns off his life support per his request, but to Stevens' surprise, his mind remains in Sean Fentress' body. He is then able to safely leave the train with Christina, also saving the rest of the passengers. Now in the alternate universe, an alternate version of Goodwin receives an email from Stevens explaining what has happened and that the Source Code can alter the target alternate reality. The movie ends with Stevens taking Fentress' place, and asking Goodwin to help Captain Colter Stevens and tell him that ""everything will be OK."", which Goodwin had told Stevens earlier in the film.<br/><br/>Verdict: a thought provoking film that questions our deepest darkest fears about death. The only downside about the film is that it is too brief, and should have been longer. As the film approaches the finale, there is no real climax ending for the viewer.<br/><br/>Similar films: The Race Against Time (2000 TV), Time After Time (1979), Deja Vu (2006), Groundhog day (1993), The Time Machine (1960, 2002 remake), Time Cop (1994), A.P.E.X.

","Don't you hate it when people want to summarize a film in one tagline or ""pitch""? <br/><br/>Let's try here - ""Inception meets Groundhog Day"" and similar in tone to the recent ""Adjustment Bureau"".<br/><br/>Useful in this circumstance, as to give too much detail will spoil your enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>We can safely allow that Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on a train, it does not end well, despite meeting the very finely cheek boned Christina (Bridget Monaghan).<br/><br/>This will not happen just the once, another clue. The military are involved, a prerequisite in any film involving conspiracy theories and shadowy going's on.<br/><br/>The film achieves a delicate balance of thriller, romance, Sci-Fi and drama, no easy task if the tone of the film is to remain consistent. Director Duncan Jones, has crafted perhaps not a classic, but a solid piece of entertainment, whilst also broadening the film into something more than might be suggested or expected.<br/><br/>The characterizations are good, Gyllenhaal makes a believable protagonist with many and varied possible work occupations and through some acting skill, makes the completely unbelievable, believable. No easy task, compare with early Harrison Ford for a fair comparison.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is perhaps not in this league yet but this is a solid step in the right direction. Monaghan is delectable, changing her attitude and reactions appropriate to the situation and Vera Farmiga (Colleen) as a controller type character, makes some headway in a difficult role.<br/><br/>Jeffery Wright, as Dr Rutledge seems somewhat uncomfortable in his role, not really buying into the character he is tasked with selling. Choosing to play the character a little more malevolent and chewing a bit more scenery, metaphorically speaking, might have added to the film. This might also provide more credibility for Colleen's later character arc.<br/><br/>The effects are solid although not intrusive, serving the stories purpose and not the other way round. The story is inventive and just when the tension appears to have dissipated, finds another worthwhile plot strand for a thoughtful and intriguing ending.<br/><br/>Not quite ""Inception"" level spinning top debates, or endless blog ruminations perhaps but this should be good for a discussion when the credits run. Which may be sooner than you think with a relatively short running time for a modern film.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Intriguing, thought provoking thriller with a good blend of sci-fi, drama and a fine sprinkling of humour.<br/><br/>Recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","I was told about Source Code by a friend of mine who was psyched about it. So I decided to give it a try. I was expecting a usual action packed thriller with not much of a storyline. But, what I saw was a very well scripted, intellectually challenging movie with not too much action. I actually had to watch it again to get the full gist of it. The story revolves around a soldier played by Jake Gyllenhaal who did full justice to his role. This might be his best performance after Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain.<br/><br/>Source Code, being a science-fiction, had some non-explainable facets to it. But, the writer did his best to keep things clear and not make it too complicated. It may probably not win an Oscar next year, nevertheless, it is the best thriller this year and deserves to be watched at least once."
"gengar843","10","4","7","15 April 2011"," Absorbing and Conservative
","I don't often see a modern film that I thoroughly enjoy, but this is one of the exceptions. From the start, you are immersed in the world of secret ops, a soldier subjected to experiments in the hopes of gaining some advantage over the enemy. However, this familiar theme changes abruptly. Rather than engaging the audience on a secret level (revealing a surprise only at the end), and rather than leaving prior information to itself, the screenwriter both elevates the level of consciousness and conscience as the movie goes forward. The viewer is expected to adapt to new situations almost as fast as the protagonist, and the ante is raised at every turn. Just when you think you understand what's going on, a new twist is added. The greatest of these is in the exploration of paradoxes. Many films, notably Back to the Future, have attempted to logically explain the space-time continuum, but none truly satisfactorily. This foray, I think, has done a superlative job. Even the deeper questions have plausible answers, according to the premises set. The ambiance is actually more like Groundhog Day, but the engineering is closer to The Matrix.<br/><br/>As to the plot, it is riveting, and includes quite a few subplots which are handled with delicacy and efficiency. Everything from the romantic interest to the family background is explored (though some with more superficiality than others). The person with whom I went cried at one poignant moment, but not for the reason I believed! This film has depth.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as a combat soldier (much better than a Ben Affleck), and he brings the correct mentality and fervor to the part. Sure, a bit over-the-top, but it suits the predicament(s). His co-stars are ancillary, but fit the blend.<br/><br/>You will be warmed, shocked, and surrender to the outlandish ending. I hope when the DVD is released they include several alternate endings. Not that the theatre version is bad - not by any means - but I would like to imbibe in a few different avenues.<br/><br/>As to the conservatism, I thoroughly enjoyed the respect given to the American soldier, even as the military-industrial complex is exposed (yet again).<br/><br/>A few more twists delighted me, particularly the equal time given to a black genius seeking to exploit the naive white patriot (in typical casting, you might expect someone like Mos Def to be the hero and Anthony Hopkins to be the villain).<br/><br/>All in all, different and worth several viewings."

Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Just a couple of things that irked me, if Jake Gyllenhaal's character is already dead and hooked up to the machine, why did they have to set him up in that weird wrecked ship? Why did the air con in that place fail? What was the point of the stupid garbage about the cards and the opera cloak? If the source code is based on the memories of the bomb victims, how could details change so dramatically (in one version the red-head psych student got off at the stop with a bike FFS!!!)? <br/><br/>It really is a disgrace that studio execs in Hollywood take a film that is rightly popular (Inception) and then chuck millions into any old garbage that looks vaguely enough like it to sell some product placement. Jake Gyllenhaal should be ashamed of himself for lending the credibility to this film his name brings."

Instead of SW source code they could run "" April fool"" but it is already may. Also there has been quiet a bit of illogical stuff happening here and there. For example, the hero is in the memory of someone who is dead. But how can he do stuff which the dead hasn't done. I guess like in i ROBOT there is a limit of a dead mind.

The movie makes you feel very smart for understanding each twist and turn. Every single second is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind. The movie is clever. Of course the movie does toy around with some very profound ideas, especially in the last few minutes, and sometimes they don't always work. However most of the time the movie leaves you guessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters, escpically the main character. The sheer complexity makes it mind bending.

","I would never say Source Code is a bad movie, but there are simply way too many gushing reviews - from critics and viewers alike - than this film warrants. That the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be argued. I quite enjoyed the main character's recurring trips inside the source code scenario. The problem is that the central premise of Source Code is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous. It's as if the filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility very slowly, the audience won't notice. It does seem like many viewers either didn't notice or didn't mind the holes. I'm willing to entertain the occasional logical stretch, but when it is the film's central premise being stretched beyond recognition, that's when I begin to have a problem. As much as I wanted to go along for the ride, I just couldn't go all the way. By the end, the cumulative effect of all the liberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump Source Code from out of the sci-fi genre and into the fantasy world."
"Leofwine_draca","5","3","5","25 April 2012"," Muddled time travel oddity
","A bit of a strange one, this. From the premise and trailer it looked like just the sort of film that's up my street: a tense thriller utilising time travel in a more inventive way than most, packed with explosive action and a race-against-the-clock countdown. Having just watched it, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it all.<br/><br/>For a start, despite the best efforts of the cast members, it's not the emotionally involving thriller that I was hoping. Gyllenhaal's soldier, despite some pretty hefty emotional moments, just didn't grab my sympathies as a leading man. Michelle Monaghan, as the train passenger he begins to develop feelings for, is bland, as if the romantic element is there just for the sake of it and the scriptwriter couldn't do anything apart from make her a one-dimensional figure for Gyllenhaal to fall in love with.<br/><br/>Decent supporting actors, like Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright, are underused in stock roles. The action on the train is well directed by Duncan Jones, but the fact that Gyllenhaal can keep returning over and over saps the movie of impact and makes it all feel artificial; it looks great but is hollow inside. When Gyllenhaal believes that it's all a simulator early on, you're inclined to agree with him. The eventual reveal of the villain is underwhelming and, even worse, the time travel elements of the script become disjointed and muddled so that in the end, after the umpteenth twist, you feel entirely disassociated from the movie. To my mind, Denzel Washington's DEJA VU covers a similar premise to much better effect."

","I heard about this movie as a good one from a friend and decided to give it a watch. I thought it would be just another action movie with some computers stuff involved,obviously judging by the name of the movie. The movie starts out with Jake Gyllenhal as Colonel Colter Stevens, being in a Chicago commuter train. He is not sure of how he came there and he does not recognize the girl talking to him. Soon to his astonishment, he finds that he is living as someone other person. Before he understands anything, the train blows up and he finds himself in a pod. And he is being briefed that he was in a mission and he needs to undergo the same till he finds the bomber, so that he can stop yet another explosion in the REAL WORLD!<br/><br/>So, what world is he in? Is he alive? There pops numerous questions in his mind. And he finds that Captain who is briefing him is reluctant to give answers that he needs. Source code, the artificial world he is in, comes from the concepts of Quantum physics and parallel universe theory. He is living the last eight minutes of a guy who died in the train accident already. Soon he realizes that he is already almost dead and just one part of his brain is active. Will he save another disaster by finding the bomber? Is it possible to save the girl he is with? Or is he just living a shadow of the past?..<br/><br/>The Story reveals itself in a rapid pace from the beginning to the end. When he had fallen for the girl, I thought he would end up saving the girl. But there is an unexpected twist. With the concept of Parallel Universes and Quantum Physics, there is another realm of existence. A mind boggling unexpected climax!<br/><br/>The movie is gripping and will make you sit on the edge. Great execution by Duncan Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal has done exceedingly well as Colonel Colter Stevens. His acting during the last simulation of the source code, proves him as a matured actor. Michelle Monaghan as Christina and Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin have done more than justice to their roles. Former being the innocent girl friend and the latter a sympathetic captain. For people who are sci-fi freaks, they would have guessed the way how story unfolds during the later part of the movie. But for an average movie buff, the story would unfold in a totally unexpected way. This is not another action movie,but an Intellectual Thriller!"

","Cinema is an art, beautiful, complex and surreal . To make a good film requires more than just money and a fancy equipment. The problem nowadays is that it has become more and more difficult to actually find the art in cinema . We have movies coming out, it seems in factory lines, with a particular format of budget and emotions. And all this while we forget to add the soul in films.... the soul which makes it what it is, but then again every once in a while we come across something which surprises us but at the same time we find the familiarity of likeness which we have been seeking for so long. It need not be too fancy or too flashy. All it needs to be is a good idea, cleverly executed. Source Code is a perfect example of that! Having heard a lot about the film, I still kept my expectations low. In comparison to the brand of cinema (in 3D, might I add) we've been witnessing lately, it wasn't surprising that people have developed a tendency of appreciating anything mediocre these days. What I saw, however, blew my mind away. Not because it was an extremely well crafted script, not because Jake Gyllenhaal performed spectacularly but because it managed to join the small list of films which I entitle as beautiful. Made on a reported budget of a mere 35 million dollars, it did what most of these so called blockbusters haven't managed to do, made me sit in one place for one and a half hour......in awe.<br/><br/>""Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train heading to Chicago. Although the other passengers all seem to know him, he has absolutely no idea where or even who he is. The last thing Colter remembers is flying a helicopter mission in Iraq, but here he is in someone else's life, being referred to as ""Sean"" by his traveling companion (Michelle Monaghan). Even the man in the mirror looks nothing like him. Before he can find out what's going on, an express train zooms by on the opposite track and a bomb on the train explodes.<br/><br/>Colter then wakes up in a chamber where an officer on the screen (Vera Farmiga) tells him that he has just returned from the ""Source Code"", a secret government project which lets him go back to the last 8 minutes of a person's life and re-live it. His job is to use those 8 minutes in order to find out who the bomber on the train was as that is their only key to saving the other places where the bomb has been planted.<br/><br/>The movie works on a large scale mostly due to the combined brilliant efforts of both the director and its lead actor. Jake Gyllenhaal displays a wonderful presence of character and has, after a long time given such a wonderful performance, supported well by the rest of the cast members which includes a surprise number in the form of Russel Peters. Also remarkable were the special effects which showed that YOU DO NOT NEED 3D TO MAKE A VISUALLY WELL SHOT FILM, but what works most for the film is its human element which manages to make an otherwise imperfect film, beautiful. Being a science fiction film it could well have gone down the path taken by most science-fiction films where good concept is traded off for action scenes and everything that could have helped it become a masterpiece is flushed down the drain. Instead, Source Code walks down a different path... it chooses to have a soul (a la Vanilla Sky, Blade Runner and Inception) Every time Colter goes back for eight minutes, it feels as if we are back for another short adventure, building our anticipation about what indeed we are going to find next. Director Duncan Jones manages to make a fast-paced gripping thriller and displays enough reasons why he will be the one to watch out for in the years to come! With every film, he is evolving into a fantastic direct0r. Moon suggested it and now Source Code confirms it too. That's 2/2 for you! <br/><br/>If Inception and now Source Code are anything to go by, rest assured this decade, might turn very well turn out to be the age of intelligent, thrilling science fiction movies.<br/><br/>Thank you Duncan Jones, for re-establishing my faith in the new breed of film directors. Not all's lost!! <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 <br/><br/>Written by Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com"
"dharmendrasingh","8","3","5","22 April 2011"," Exactly what you'd expect from someone whose Dad once sang about spiders from Mars
","For a guy whose Dad used to sing about spiders from Mars, it's probably apt that he turned out to be a sci-fi whiz kid. Duncan Jones burst onto the scene with his 2009 sci-fi drama 'Moon', starring the great but underrated Sam Rockwell. He made an impression with that film and makes an even bigger one with his sophomore film.<br/><br/>The first time I saw 'Source Code' I dismissed it as mere escapist folly. A (much recommended) second viewing confirmed the film is clever, full of ideas, original and, most importantly, hugely entertaining. It's like a song you dismiss upon your first hearing but grow to love. I had precisely the same experience with Wes Anderson's 'The life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'; now it's one of my favourites of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>'Source Code' opens with alternating, swooping tracking shots of a moving train against a wonderfully modern, almost futuristic, Chicago. The Hitchcockian music presages the relentlessly fast pace of the film. Don't reach for popcorn, or make notes like I had to; you'll miss a vital plot point.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal awakens on this train and finds himself sitting opposite Christina (Michelle Monaghan). She refers to him as 'Sean' but he insists he's Captain Colter Stevens, a US soldier who flies planes in Afghanistan. He's acutely aware of his surroundings, all of his senses are heightened.<br/><br/>Then the train blows up. He is zapped from the train to a desolate, blackened capsule, with only a computer screen for company. A face emerges on it. It's the pretty face of Vera Farmiga's character, Goodwin. She administers a quick mental test to ensure he is compos mentis. He passes. 'Welcome back, Captain', Goodwin reassures him.<br/><br/>He obtains as much information as he can about his situation. The company he is part of is called Beleaguered Castle. He's on a mission to find out who bombed the train. He will keep being zapped back to the train until he finds the bomber. How this is all possible, he finds out later, is due to 'Source Code'.<br/><br/>'Source Code', the theory goes, allows access to a parallel reality. This reality is opened when a person's circuit memory remains active for eight minutes after their death. These eight minutes can then be re-lived by someone whose profile (DNA?) resembles the deceased's. Stevens' profile matches one of the train's commuters – Sean Fentress, a teacher.<br/><br/>Now things start to make sense and the action can be enjoyed without having to stop and think too much. Events fall into place more or less how we envisage them. There's a nice twist as to who the bomber is, but anyone who calls themselves a buff will guess correctly based on classic rules of audience deception.<br/><br/>Apart from 'Donnie Darko', Gyllenhall has scored big with performances in Jim Sheridan's 'Brothers' and Jim Madden's 'Proof'. He brings an appealing physicality to this role. He assumes the nuances of each scene skilfully and seamlessly. Like only some of Hollywood's hunks, he is valued both as a serious actor and as a bit of eye candy. My only gripe is that he's still a tad too young to pull off this kind of demanding role. Every role requiring him to be experienced and worldly, have him come off as boyish and unpersuasive.<br/><br/>A flaw here is that Gyllenahaal plays Stevens as relatively sanguine. Surely a person in his position would be the epitome of furious, if not in state of permanent disbelief or apoplexy. I'd wager that it would have benefited the story's subterfuge if Sam Rockwell had played him.<br/><br/>It's not a point that's been dwelled upon but there are four big twists. Containing them in 93 minutes, and doing so engrossingly, shows Jones's talent. Never is the film geeky or inaccessible. That's not to say it's not intellectual – it is, and Jones manages to reconcile some clever and complex ideas. The film raises an ethical question: Should such a device as Source Code, if it existed, be used in the fight in the 'war on terror'? <br/><br/>Much of the success of 'Source Code' is down to the Editor, Paul Hirsch, whose precise timing in cutting back and forth between the train and capsule keep you hooked. Credit also to the SFX staff: the explosions look charmingly fake. <br/><br/>I would have liked Ben Ripley's script to develop the Source Code theory a bit more – because it's fascinating and the film wouldn't have lost anything by dropping a few of the near-duplicated mission scenes. One or two sentences by Jeffrey Wright explaining Source Code aren't quite satisfactory, neither is Gyllenhaal saying 'Yeah, I know, quantum physics and parabolic calculus'. <br/><br/>Jeffrey Wright is believable, like he normally is, as Dr Rutledge, the patriotic zealot responsible for creating Source Code. Vera Farmiga is spot on as Rutledge's dedicated but compassionate co-worker, though her role is easy. The comedian Russell Peters features quite extensively as an obnoxious passenger on the train, though I'm not sure his appearance is necessary.<br/><br/>The characters remain sedentary for most of the film. The few kinetic sequences were just enough to break the monotony. The end scene is played out in real time, where we get to see a full episode of Source Code, i.e. a whole eight-minute scene, which is as heart-wrenching as it is cathartic. I won't spoil it by asking why Stevens' Dad doesn't recognise his own son's voice? <br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"
"ayoreinf","8","3","5","6 April 2011"," No intentional spoiler inside
","Let me start by saying, I didn't mean to see ""Source Code"". It was one of those films I red about and thought I might see them one day, but it was sheer accident I ended up seeing it. And despite some plot holes I enjoyed it. The acting is first class, Gyllenhaal is repeating his Prince of Persia role, so much so I could call the earlier movie a spoiler for this one, but that's all I'm going to say on the subject. Problem is this film is almost impossible to speak about without adding spoilers. I can say the pacing was perfect, I can say it's an action sci-fi (many scientist will debate this) in which most of the action is psychological. I could add a special commendation for Vera Farmiga whose role is much harder than most of the others on the film and she still performs superbly, but truth is that's all I can say without adding a spoiler.<br/><br/>So here is the bottom line, despite the mentioned plot holes, the movie works and that's what matters."
"jadepietro","7","3","5","3 April 2011"," Everybody deserves a second chance, although Colter Stevens has about eight chances to redo history in eight minutes or less.
","That modern day classic film, Inception, has already influenced today's filmmaking studios with its artistry and its monetary grosses. Just go to your nearest movieplex and you'll see other films about mind control games, like the two more recent hits, Limitless, and The Adjustment Bureau. Now comes yet a third...<br/><br/>Source Code is the latest in this genre, a time warped story about time travel to a parallel universe. It's the clever Groundhog Day formula re-imagined as an action thriller with the same tired déjà vu structure of Vantage Point, set aboard a moving train. ( I know, it's also reminiscent of hundreds of other sci-fi diversions like Back to the Future, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, and the Terminator series; action hits, like Speed, Unstoppable, and Run, Lola, Run; romantic movies like Sliding Doors and Time After Time, and even television series like Mission Impossible, 24, and Lost, to name a few others. )<br/><br/>But Source Code wisely takes its lead from those other films and stays on track pretty much of the time. The film begins with a puzzling dilemma: a soldier awakens on a train to find himself in the body of another person and on a train that will self destruct in 8 minutes. He is also hooked up to mind control operatives headed by the military who are in charge of a secret experimental program called Source Code who give our hero a mission to save mankind: Find the bomber and prevent this and other terroristic attacks from happening. Now granted the circumstances are enough to shock anyone, let alone our protagonist. But with a name like Colter, you know he's the right one for this job and he means business. <br/><br/>The appealing Jake Gyllenhaal is perfectly cast. As he tries to unravel the mystery, the audience immediately is held in rapt attention due to the topnotch direction by Duncan Jones, a wonderful convoluted script by Ben Ripley, and a fine cast of performers. Michelle Monaghan plays Christina, Cotter's short-lived love interest who keeps coming back for more. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright effectively serve the plot as major catalysts heading this mission. <br/><br/>Not only is Source Code a tense thriller, but it's a nifty whodunit as well. The film tries to remain logical and intriguing, although there are one too many twisty plot devices that tend to border on overdrive. Add to that mix, a stilted familiarity of the scenes being constantly replayed and reversed time and time again that becomes somewhat tedious and strained.<br/><br/>Still, most of the time, it's edge-of-your-seat excitement and suspense. Source Code has much to admire. It is a well crafted, intelligent, and entertaining joyride. GRADE: B"
"normandracula","Null","4","8","10 August 2011"," Strictly commercial
","OK, here's the pitch. A group of evil film makers plot to cross Blade Runner with Groundhog Day and end up creating a soulless and cynical exercise in viewer manipulation that does very well at the box office. No, wait, we've forgotten to include Minority Report. Within the first eight minutes you know with 99.999987% certainty pretty much everything that's going to happen. Which is that our soulful and anguished hero is going to get the mad bomber and the kookie girl; all that's required to make this happen is some routine investigation, some ludicrous science, some some stock characters, an ersatz moral dilemma, so-so special effects and a laughable yet nauseating feelgood ending. In other words, all the required elements of a standard studio movie. No, no, it still not quite there .. maybe we make our guy a captain in the US army who fell out with his dad and got killed in a heroic and patriotic fashion outside Kandahar .. Greenlight!<br/><br/>It can't be just me who longs for a sci-fi film that wasn't fathered by accountants, written by computers and tested on demographic cross sections of the Californian public wired up to electrocardiograms. Why can't the hero end up handcuffing the mad girl and kissing the kookie bomber? Or anything with the tiniest, most minuscule hint of authentic creative thought. Dream on."
"strigliariko","5","4","8","3 April 2011"," Errr I guess OK?
","The movie was good for a pop corn night, or to kill your time if you have nothing better to do. According to my expectations it was kinda what I suspected, although I am sure I will not remember much of it tomorrow. Sadly, it is a reproduction of many movies like 12 monkeys, Deja Vu, Butterfly Effect etc etc etc etc. So it delivers nothing new, but at least the acting is good. The story is a bit boring too and it is obvious from the beginning that the guy is not where he thinks he is. But overall, I did not feel sorry for watching it, but I am not thrilled either. So I guess that makes it an OK movie. I would suggest DVD rental."
"musicallyrt","1","5","11","17 October 2011"," Absolutely terrible.
","This was without doubt one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen (yes, even worse than anything Tommy Wiseau has cooked up). <br/><br/>The ""plot"" (I do not think that it is worthy of that word) has gaping wide plot holes. The ""science"" behind the plot is absurd; there is no logic present whatsoever (how is it possible for somebody to send text messages across multiple dimensions? How is it possible to exist in two dimensions at once?). Wait a second - I think I'm missing something - how is it possible to even have two dimensions? The ""scientist"" presents this pseudo scientific feat rather casually, and no time is given to explain how something like that can exist.<br/><br/>The concept that a brain can still operate at the height of what Gyllenhaal's character can in ""limbo"" is ridiculous. The complete lack of deductive reasoning on the part of the military personnel is also frustrating. If the person responsible for planting the bomb is intending to blow up a second target, then surely they must be alive to do so. Ergo, Mr Bomb man must not have been on the train at the time of the explosion. So shouldn't your first concern be not the people ON the train during the explosion, but the people getting OFF the train? In addition, how can you be certain that the bomber would be on the train in the 8 minute time slot that the protagonist had access to? <br/><br/>However, my biggest beef with this film is not the absolute lack of logic and reasoning, but rather in its completely dull and repetitive nature. The audience is presented with THE SAME EIGHT MINUTES of footage ad nauseam, with slight relief from little dialogues of our dead soldier trying to deduce how he possibly could be existing in somebody else's soon to be dead body. In the case of this film, intentionally repetitive is still mind numbingly repetitive. This has been described as a ""thriller"", but it's hard to feel thrilled when you know if the protagonist screws up, he can just go back and do it all again.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to comment on the blatant patriotic American self righteous and militaristic war on terror bullshit propaganda ""subtly"" woven in.<br/><br/>The performance of the acting is okay. Not great, not bad, but okay. It's hard to pay attention to the performance of the cast with the absurdity of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Oh, and the protagonist also walks of with the teachers life in his alternate reality. There is no mention of the morality of this.<br/><br/>Intellectual nonsense, coupled with frustratingly repetitive scenes makes this film a flop. I would rate this film 0 stars, but that isn't an option :( If you have a shred of taste and intellectuality, then I encourage you to save yourself the pain of sitting through this film."

"eichler2","5","2","3","15 January 2017"," Contradicts itself
","If you're just looking for a decent action/spy thriller with lots of explosions (or, rather, the same explosion over and over again), then you might like this movie. If you actually use your brain at all, the crazy plot holes will ruin it for you.<br/><br/>The premise is that a military pilot gets ""volunteered"" to take part in a program where he relives the last eight minutes of the life of the victim of a train crash, over and over again, ""Groundhog Day"" style. The train was destroyed by a bomb killing hundreds of people, and the authorities have reason to believe the bomber intends something bigger like nuking a major city. Our hero has to find the bomber and report his identity so he can be stopped.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS BELOW)<br/><br/>Now, the movie clearly sets out that the military has developed some method to preserve the last eight minutes of someone's short term memory after they die. That's not too much of a stretch - I could see them being very interested in a project like that. Furthermore, they can ""inject"" someone into those memories to relive them as if they were reality. OK, starting to reach there, but lets run with it...<br/><br/>The problem is that once our hero gets inside the memory, he starts doing things the original person never did, seeing things they never saw, etc. So it's not just a memory, it's more of a complete simulation of the train based on a memory, including things the original person couldn't have possibly known (like where the bomb is hidden).<br/><br/>It gets worse. By the end of the film, it's not just a total simulation, it's an alternate reality. So the good guy not only manages to stop the original bombing, but gets to live happily ever after with the girl he just met, call his father and give him closure about his death, and send an email to the technician running the military project to let her know what he did. I guess the implication is that the people who created this miracle technology thought they were only running a simulation (a fact that they state over and over again in explaining why the past can't be changed), but our hero knows better and has figured out a way to turn it into an alternate reality.<br/><br/>Makes absolutely no sense. They should have just ended it after he reported back the identity of the bomber, but then the movie would have only been an hour long. And just what happens to the poor SOB whose body the main character takes over in the end? Too bad for him, I guess.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, but it just went too far, contradicted itself and broke any possible willing suspension of disbelief."

I didn't find much urgency or emotion from him and I thought he is best left to be doing dramas. There are a bit of plot holes and unexplained elements, ***spoiler ahead*** especially what actually took place during the climax of the film. ***spoiler ends*** <br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad movie to pass the time with.

","Captain Colter(Gyllenhaal, driven), wakes up on a Chicago subway train, sitting opposite of Christina(Monaghan, adorable, if less so than she was in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which is still a ton). She knows, and clearly likes, him, yet he has no recollection of getting on, nor does he recognize her or his own reflection! 8 minutes later, the car blows up. He comes to, back in that same situation. It has already happened, but he can keep going over that portion of time, and try to find and stop the bomb. And, lest you think there is no tension or reason for us to care(as is the case with Edge of Tomorrow), he has to do it fast it was only the first attack, and he is the best chance of preventing the next one.<br/><br/>This gains a lot from the human story in there, with our protagonist's insistence on being more than a tool, by being allowed to contact his father outside of the ""replay"", and the studio-enforced, yet still sweet, romance. The explanation for the sci-fi aspects strains credulity, though not to the breaking point. It's fun to see him try to crack the mystery, and we are guessing right along with him. Ultimately, the solution has a number of problems: it feels so convenient and simple that I kept waiting for the twist to it, and it's easy once we get there, to the point where the audience wonders why it took so long to get there. The effects, editing and cinematography are very nicely done.<br/><br/>This isn't as clever as it thinks it is. It also doesn't realize all of the ethical issues the concept brings up, in spite of trying to address the ones it can. The subtle exploration of post-9/11 thinking is one of the greatest strengths here. With a running time of 83 minutes not counting the end credits(89 with), and the first(as we're waiting for the film to establish what we go into it already knowing, or at least be entertaining until it gets there) and last quarter of an hour not being all that compelling, we're left with a middle that is enjoyable enough still, I don't expect I'll watch this again. While the ending does make sense, it's rather sappy, and we end up feeling more tricked than surprised.<br/><br/>The DVD comes with the three(the latter two alternate subtitles, every few minutes a short piece of text will come up, neither of them spoil anything, so you can just put them on for the first viewing) informational tracks: #1: audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, Director Duncan Jones, and Writer Ben Ripley, #2: Access Source Code: Trivia(facts that have some connection to what's on screen, such as a ""no smoking"" sign telling us when such a ban was first done. They don't really have anything to do with the movie itself. It's funny in a quirky sort of way, since it's like watching the film with an easily distracted, sentient encyclopedia, which responds to the visuals with free association – after a while, I started trying to guess, sometimes successfully, what it would ""pick"" to spout stuff about.) and #3: Tales of Time Travel(titles and short descriptions of time travel stories, most of them films, in no particular order decent, but it might as well have been text in a menu), three interesting featurettes: the 26 minute Cast and Crew Insights(interviews), 6 and a half minute Focal Points(the concepts are explained) and 18 minute Expert Intel(physics professor discusses the realism of different aspects of this), trailers for Unknown, Brighton Rock, Attack the Block and this, and an ad for Mars.<br/><br/>There is a little violence, disturbing content and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of stories about time-travel, alternate universes, etc. 7/10"

Also, nothing more annoying than the flirting in the middle of the mission. I think once he was able to find the bomber, the rest of the movie became bearable and actually exciting. I just don't get the end though. So do the people in the train survive? Isn't that against the quantum physics parabolic calculus thingy? And if he does get to survive, does he live the rest of his life as that other character. Quite frankly this movie is not worth any of my brain cells contemplating on the ending.

I'm quite surprised by how much material is rehashed here, most notably from the Tony Scott film 'Deja-Vu', which features an almost identical plot device.<br/><br/>There are also elements lifted from features like 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'The Jacket' and 2008's 'Vantage Point' which, while not necessarily better movies, can at least hold their heads high in the non-plagiarism stakes.<br/><br/>At any rate, if you can get over the sheer lack of inventiveness in the script, the movie has some mildly entertaining action scenes (well, a single action scene shown repeatedly), and some decent acting.<br/><br/>All in all I didn't hate this movie, but it's quite depressing to see someone who was briefly shaping up to be a unique talent and a fresh voice in the Hollywood movie scene, simply decide to churn out a quite lazy and above all safe piece of movie making.

","i recently watched source code, limitless, and unknown which i will make a review for each of them. all these movies have something in common i feel the directors try to rush they don't take enough time to explain the complicated concepts and events in which is crucial to understand the movies, they also do not shed enough light on key role characters, in addition the dialog is often vague in which the viewer is not clear on whats happening, in a nutshell the storytelling in all three movies is plain CRAPPY (Unknown not so much), i cant help but feel that most directors are attempting to imitate Christopher Nolan style which i despise (making fairly complicating ideas into hugely complicated through his very bad direction and storytelling and even dialog. in limitless and source code specifically very little information is provided keeping the viewer thinking in order to fill the illogical gaping holes in the technicality of the story and the complicated events revolving around the main character leaving the viewer thinking logically of what or why just happened instead of just enjoying the moment. and this what i don't recognize in older movies i don't feel the movie is an outline or a summary of a longer movie, and i don't feel the compression of the development of incidences during the movie.<br/><br/>--Source Code--- the main point i don't like about that movie is the carelessness of explaining the concept behind the source code, they explained it in a very superficial way, i am sure most people wont care, but for me it makes a big difference, especially towards the end it quickens its pace although the end part is the most complicated part, when he sent the sms why didn't she receive it instantly? and when he wrote it how did he know he will continue to live?(as he stated in the sms). i also noticed that every time Stevens returned to the bunker was because he died NOT because the eight minutes were over. so they did an awful job explaining the technicality. also the part where he was freezing and things went wrong in the bunker the screen was broken, i don't get this part at all how did that happen? , this part just doesn't belong in the movie, its just a scene they put there to extend time."

","""Son of David Bowie"" Duncan Jones makes really great sci-fi films and one of my favorite genres is sci-fi so I really appreciate it. He started out with the super low-budget sci-fi Moon. I liked Moon but one thing bothered me about the movie, the point/twist of the movie was revealed too early in the film. Now Jones is back with Source Code and he delivers the goods once again.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer then you know the basic plot. The movie starts with our main character Captain Colter Stevens waking up on the train sitting opposite to a woman who obviously knows him and calls him ""Sean"" but he doesn't know her, he runs away to the bathroom and he sees in the mirror reflection a completely different man then suddenly the train explodes. We are transported into this weird capsule where he is ""briefed"" about what's all this about. The movie keeps jumping between these two settings: between the Source Code (I am not going to spoil what it actually is like some professional reviewers or some reviewers here on IMDb) and the reality but that doesn't limit the film in any way. The director manages to keep the movie suspenseful, balanced with amount of ""action"" scenes and mysteries to keep the audience guessing. Especially after the brilliant opening scene he' s got everyone pulled inside the film and on the edge of their seats, that's where Duncan Jones shows off his skills. The movie bears a lot of resemblance to Twelve Monkeys and Deja Vu (trying to save something/someone repeatedly or prevent something from happening or the hi-tech playing with time) so that doesn't make it completely original idea but I' m glad anyway that Hollywood still has some fresh ideas in the safe.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal pulls here probably his best performance yet. He is quite charming here, completely believable when he is confused, funny and realistic when he is falling for the girl who he can meet only in the Source Code. He is very sympathetic and he looks great with a gun. Jake Gyllenhaal has grown into one hell of a great actor. Michelle Monaghan is cute and manages to make a great character even with the minimum of screen time. The oddly accented Dr. Rutledge, the creator of the Source Code, played by Jeffrey Wright is the only character who provides the audience with some sort of explanation.<br/><br/>In the end this is a very enjoyable suspenseful sci-fi thriller but with a few flaws so it can't be put alongside classics like Twelve Monkeys or Inception. It's got a great concept but not just so mind bending. I hope this will be a box-office success so Duncan Jones will provide us with another well made movie"

","3 April 2011. While a number of critics may refer back to the comedy fantasy classic GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) for comparison purposes for its spin on repeating the same event over and over again, an over-reliance to this movie for a comparison isn't as valuable as it might be as GROUNDHOG DAY in a number of ways excels in its detail and script in using the apparent paradox of having to relive the same moment over and over again to better effect. Probably a better sci fi comparison for this movie would be last year's INCEPTION and even CUBE ZERO (2004) as they have much more relevant and similar psychological elements both apparently sinister and underlying surface suspense as well as what really was captured well in both other movies and what is surprising in this movie - a surprising emotional, relational depth and resonance that was particularly difficult considering the limited room for relational development in the movie. There was a hope before the movie was experienced that some of the intelligent and crisp action from THE BOURNE IDENTITY might surface but it really didn't appear in this movie. Overall this movie provides a satisfying, thrilling, entertaining movie-going experience for the times."

I'm a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Faminga and Michelle Monaghan so it was no wonder I liked it. In fairness, I'm a sucker for any time-travel related films. It is the ultimate bitter sweet ending. The frozen scene of all the passengers laughing and smiling was brilliantly shot. However the only issue I have with the end is that even thought it's an alternate reality, she still sees another man. What happened to the man whose body he is inhabiting? Anyway... I hate that it nags away at me, but still a good movie."

If anything it ruins the whole narrative of the movie up to then, and could have easily been avoided by just being a tad more linear than going for the ""unexpected"" alternative. The last scene really serves to make the movie ""shoot itself in both feet"" and brings everything down. Which is sad, as that scene isn't even necessary to the film or sequence of events. Also I found the movie lacked a bit of ""depth"", its too superficial. Great potential but ultimately a flop of sorts, I don't recommend it, there are plenty other more awesome movies out there."

Its best to go in knowing a minimal amount of what is going to happen. In fact, the movie itself is minimal, but by answering things that are usually important to the story at a rapid pace, the minimalist effect works well. Some may complain of the ending, but it works within the story well and leaves the audience with a large amount of space to think. All in all, an enjoyable ride that will leave you contemplating what you saw and satisfied with its workmanlike nature."
"zkonedog","6","1","1","10 March 2017"," Keeps You Engaged, But Doesn't Rise Any Higher
","""Source Code"" is a solid movie that will keep you engaged from beginning to end. It has good acting, an interesting premise, and a plot that takes the entire running time to develop and thus makes you want to keep watching. However, the film fails to rise to sci-fi classic status due to a failure to develop anything other than that interesting plot.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Source Code"" follows the strange occurrences of Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), a military soldier involved in a top-secret time-travel experiment. Without saying any more and risk ruining the overall plot, suffice it to say that Stevens' primary mission is to stop an act of terrorism involving a bomb on a passenger train...no matter how many times it takes for him to get things right.<br/><br/>The high points of this movie are the acting and the basic time-travel premise. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan turn in fine performances, as does Vera Farmiga as a conflicted military leader. The plot is also catchy, taking from previous sci-fi material found in Star Trek TNG (Picard stopping the Enterprise from blowing up) and The X-Files (Mulder trying to stop the bank from exploding).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, there is not a whole lot else in this movie to draw you in. While the acting is indeed above average, the scripted characters and their interactions are nothing to write home about. The main romantic duo that is supposed to carry the emotional base of the film just doesn't deliver the payoff in the end.<br/><br/>Also, there comes a certain point in this movie where you find yourself watching just because you want to figure everything out (after the main climax has come to a close). But (*SPOILER ALERT*): This is one of those movies that leaves the enduing up to your interpretation. Some people like that, while others don't. I guess I fall into the latter camp. There's just so much left up to us as viewers to put into place that I would have preferred a bit more scripted closure.<br/><br/>Thus, while this isn't an outright classic in my mind, it will at least entertain you for the 90+ minute duration, which is more than I can say for most movies these days. Rent it cheaply somewhere, but you really don't need to own this one."

","Well this is another film I watched just because of Gyllenhaal, and once again Jake didn't disappoint. The movie itself was just okay, nothing incredible but definitely not bad. It made an excellent use of a limited setting, uniquely using a plot with the ""Groundhog Day""-like scenario. It had a lot of different aspects, sometimes it was action packed, other times a serious drama, or a sci-fi mystery and was also occasionally funny but solidly entertaining all throughout. The premise of the entire movie was on shaky ground in my opinion. Their explanation for how the whole source code worked was vague and relied mostly on a cheap typical sci-fi scapegoat of ""quantum mechanics and calculus"" which really doesn't tell us anything. Its kind of a hollow statement that sounds really fancy if you know absolutely nothing about the subjects. The film also tried to be clever, mind-blowing and trippy in the end but it didn't really seem to work. It came across as a little fuzzy and unclear of what really transpired which I think the unexplained process of the source code and the unbelievability of it contributed to."

","After watching Moon by Duncan Jones, I was quite interested in watching his next work. After reading a brief summary of the movie, my first thought was, this will be way too similar to Deja Vu (2006, with Denzel Washington). I was wrong though, even though the movie is based on time travel as a vehicle to solve a crime, in this case the time traveler (Cpt. Stevens, cannot change what already occurred, and this travels are just merely to collect evidence).<br/><br/>A big part of the movie happens in the same train compartment where Cpt. Stevens wakes up every time he ""travels"" (it is more like access to somebody memories), however small changes occur every time, to avoid it become monotonous.<br/><br/>The movie though, gets extended 10 minutes too long, otherwise it would have been a great ending. I do like when movies end in a happy note, but they should not sacrifice the whole story to make this possible. In this case they did it (in my opinion). I know science fiction does not have to make sense all the time. However there should be a balance where even though some things might not be able to be rationalized, you should not feel the argument proposed totally dumb (specially if the movie is trying to be a bit serious like this one).<br/><br/>Score (7)"

","I love movies that make you think, and Source Code will do that, the problem is, that what you're thinking is probably what's going to happen. This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best performances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the way that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out."

","After an explosion kills a train full of people an Air force pilot is tasked with reliving the last 8 minutes of a man's life on the ill-fated train to discover who planted the bomb and prevent further attacks thanks to a project called the Source Code. However, in doing so he discovers a truth about himself is more astonishing than the source code programme itself. <br/><br/>Source Code plays out as a long Twilight Zone episode, but that's not a bad thing, it's theme is that of worm holes, parallel universes, reality consciousness and debatably time travel. There are three amusing nods to the TV series Quantum Leap two of them subtle.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is on top form here as Colter Stevens (a play on Colt Seavers possibly) and adds scope and emotion to his character as he's forced to relive the last eight minutes of life over and over again to find the bomber. Michelle Monaghan is fine with what she's been given but is really a story pawn as Stevens gets to know here better after each time the 8 minutes are rest. The most interesting character Colleen Goodwin is played superbly by Vera Farmiga who is torn between duty and Stevens' wellbeing. Jeffrey Wright (of James Bond Felix Leiter fame) gives a fitting performance as source code creator Dr. Rutledge.<br/><br/>While Duncan Jones wonderfully crafts the film with limited but successful use of effects mainly the train explosions, he manages to keep the repetitiveness fresh showing different angles revealing different parts of the train throughout. Thanks to writer Ben Ripley the story allows other settings to be used in the limited repeated 8 minutes. That said, there are few surprises, also some stereotype anti-prejudice which has now become a cliché in the bombers identity and those suspected is included. This sets it below the sharpness of Duncan Jones 2009 film Moon. <br/><br/>Thanks to the intriguing closing scene you don't feel cheated and it's a satisfying piece of constructive science fiction within a contemporary setting. Like Jones' début the poignant moments manage to tug at heart strings which for a popcorn flick is sparse these days. Recommended."

","Train now becomes a sensitive hot topic in China due to the 7.23 train-wreck accident at Wenzhou, and this film fitly offers an effectual resolution to prevent (or forestall) the tragedy, which causes an 8-minutes-save-the-world mission accomplished by a high-tech novelty called ""Source Code"". <br/><br/>Duncan Jones is sturdily paving his way for a further advancement as a new gifted director after his universally-acclaimed indie debut MOON (2009). Although SOURCE CODE, carrying a modest budget this time, Duncan's mainstream breakthrough explores again in the sci-fi genre and successfully generates a palpable solution to satisfy as much audience as possible and meanwhile maintains his auteurism among his devoted followers, from which aspect, Source Code is a decent victory. Both MOON and SOURCE CODE share a similar monochrome circumstance, claustrophobic suffocation, and deal with a straightforward trajectory of the evolution of technology (clones or time-reset mission), for me, it is not important all the happenings make sense or not, what I admire Duncan is his ability to water down the sophisticated elucidation in a range where could be digested by main population without tainting its emotional seesaw. One minor side affect is using too much platitude for the residual elements (the would-be Chicago nuclear-bomb attack looks like a tawdry joke and the ignition of love for Michelle Monaghan is evocatively banal, not to mention the ubiquitous father issue). <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal thoroughly reflexes a multi-facet impersonation as the leading role, which inevitably widens his territory and capacity. His maturity and aplomb will grant him a brighter future, which will not be so far-fetched. All the supporting cast is mainly curbed in their restricted field, Michelle and Jeffrey Wright are merely using their stock-in-trade, however the versatile Vera Farmiga's contribution is worthy of an official accolade, she magically endows a corny and stereotyped role with an empathetic credibility, even marginalizes the plot hole to a certain extent (originally I cannot understand why she risks her career just for the sake of some ""emotional"" brain wave, maybe this is the most mysterious part). <br/><br/>Finally, a big congratulation to Duncan Jones again (the first one is for MOON two years age) and I think in the near future, lesser and lesser will call him the son of David Bowie, and I wish he could astonish the world of cinema with his own free will, which is a golden mine still underdeveloped."

It's not your standard blockbuster.<br/><br/>Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley created not the most original film, but one of the best executed. A fine cast do the rest. Jake Gyllenhaal is dependable as always and especially Michelle Monaghan has the exceptional quality to have chemistry with almost any actor she works with. Believe me, in the role she is playing, it is hard not to come off as annoying or damsel in distress. And she doesn't.<br/><br/>Maybe if you looked real hard, you would find plot holes about alternate realities or universes or time travel in this film. But I didn't want to think too much.

His second movie is placed in a much more populated setting, but still very limited. The entire action takes place on board a train and in some undisclosed other facility.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the movie presented two main challenges: how to make the story and the sets not look linear and unidimensional, first, and how to induce the sensation of confusion and insecurity, second. Both problems have interesting solutions, the second one being particularly well done, with the opening sequences of the movie plunging the viewers into a very confusing environment, where they are not quite sure of what they are seeing. The angles are strange, either vertical, filmed from above straight down or very horizontal, flat and distant. It does not make sense and it is brilliant. The solution to the first problem is also very creative.<br/><br/>The script is quite complicated, and it has some problems, the techobabble being one of them. It is confusing and not very convincing, but it could have worked well. There are other problems, however with the way the drama unfolds, layer by layer. The layered approach has been used before and done better. ""Ogres are like onions."" ""You smell bad? You make people cry?"" ""Layers, Donkey, ogres have layers."" Unfortunately there are far bigger problems and one of them is the current state of the main character. It is totally uncalled for, it is a very weak and soap opera like device to introduce an unnecessary emotional charge, and it negates much more interesting possibilities and development opportunities. It also leads to a very bad ending. On the positive side, the script is very good at creating tension and drama.<br/><br/>The actors are good, with a strong emotional presence. Jake Gyllenhaal is very intense, Vera Farmiga is also intense, in a subtler, quieter way and Michelle Monaghan provides an welcomed balance to all this intensity, by being nice and relaxed.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent and very unexpected, with a very effective timing.<br/><br/>Source Code. A good thriller, if not for some script incongruities and an unnecessary ending. 6/10."

The most I can say about the movie is that it was just okay. The storyline, while repetitive, seemed to work very well. Though not everyone wants to go into a movie and see the same eight minutes repeated over and over and over, but I didn't have a problem with it. The scenes seemed to change just enough to still create a gripping story without spoiling the ending too soon.<br/><br/>As for the acting, this, in my opinion, is one of Gyllenhaal's best performances. He and Michelle Monogan blend together very well. The whole movie seemed to be held together by the very limited relationships that Gylanhalls character had with the two scientists played by Vera Farmiga and Jeffery Wright.<br/><br/>To talk about the ending without spoiling it will not come easy to me, so I'll keep it brief. I have heard and read from many critics that there is a plot twist in ""Source Code"" that really makes you think. I, however, did not get this effect. It was a surprise, but it was a very basic concept. That is all I am going to say on that.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Source Code"" is a fun movie, with great acting and an interesting story to a point.

Also, as I have a bit of a 'celeb crush' on her, I think Vera Farmiga's character came across slightly underdeveloped; you just didn't get to know anything about her.

","Wait a minute where do i begin from? ah yes in the spirit of the movie let me start from 5 years back.Tony Scott's ""DEJA VU"" released into our theaters starring his most preferred actor Denzel Washington(a total of 5 films starting with Crimson Tide).Deja Vu begins with a bomb explosion on a ferry carrying the crew of the USS Nimitz,killing both the sailors and their families.An experimental FBI surveillance unit is pressed into action who use a space folding technology to directly look back 4 days into the past to assist the investigation in identifying the bomber.<br/><br/>Now let's fast forward to 2011 and we have Duncan Jone's ""SOURCE CODE"".The premise is very similar to Deja Vu,the movie begins with an explosion killing over 100 passengers traveling in a commuter train to Chicago and the protagonist has to assume the identity of another man and relive the last 8 Min's before the explosion to investigate and identify the bomber.<br/><br/>The first 30 Min's keeps you interested with the scenes playing in an indefinite loop where the actors repeat the same actions and lines till the explosion.There is nothing much to write home about the acting however Jake Gyllenhaal our protagonist did a decent job in the role of an American Army helicopter pilot.While Michelle Monaghan just had to repeat the same dialog ""I took your advice blah blah"" every time Jake wakes up on the train in the body of an unknown man.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington in Deja Vu while investigating the bombing finds a connection between a murder of a woman on the same day of the bombing.He falls in love eventually and builds a mental picture of the dead girl while searching her apartment.So in the end he travels back in time to save her from being murdered by the bomber while putting his own life at risk.<br/><br/>In Source Code Jake falls for Michelle from the few lines of dialog they exchange before Jake set's off to catch the bomber before the bomb goes off again in 8 Min's.Beats me why Jake would risk his life to save her from the explosion.I can understand Denzel Washington trying to save the beautiful Paula Patton but why Michelle? why Jake why? I bet Heath Ledger (Broke Back Mountain) was far more interesting than her.can't remember one striking feature about Michelle to make a guy put his life at risk.<br/><br/>The biggest Goof-up in Source code has to be when the bomber must blow up the train exactly when a freight train passes by.But the bomber gets off at a station just before the explosion.He clearly can not see the trains passing each other from where he is standing!<br/><br/>Source Code is a mash-up of both Deja Vu and it's equally brilliant counterpart ""GROUNDHOG DAY"" where Bill Murray finds himself living the same day over and over again.The Writer of Source Code Ben Ripley is hands down ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" a 1999 movie starring Matt Damon as Tom Ripley whose talents include impressions and forgery.Ben clearly ripped off Deja Vu and Ground Hog day to script Source Code without any major changes in the premise.It's a shame that critics like Roger Ebert and Rajeev Masand failed to notice the similarity and to top it all they gave a generous rating of 3.5/5.<br/><br/>The Director Duncan Jones should from here on script his own stories like previously for his debut movie ""MOON"" starring Sam Rockwell which was 100% original and genuine.Of course Jones is no Tony Scott but he is a decent director in his own right. you can follow him here on twitter HTTP://twitter.com/#!/ManMadeMoon<br/><br/>Watch Source Code if you haven't seen Deja Vu before,trust me you will enjoy watching it and have a good laugh about my review later.However i felt the movie was dragging itself to the finish and a lot predictive.Yes i know i just wasted an hour trying to convince my friends not to watch Source Code but sadly they will go watch it anyway.i think i am going to beat myself up now."

","Initially I thought this film was your typical action movie, but I heard some really great things about it so I went and watched it anyway... Little did I know, film reviewers sometimes tend to have quite bad taste. Let me clarify - it wasn't a HORRIBLE movie. It just wasn't great. Jake Gyllenhall and Vera Farmiga are good in this movie, but their performances didn't exactly blow me away. (Pun definitely not intended) The film was almost comically patriotic and extremely clichéd. Also, there are some pretty major plot holes - assuming that I've understood the whole premise correctly. Like why he can leave the train for example? I think my problem was that I had high expectations for Source Code and it just didn't quite live up to them. As a sci-fi / action film with it's pretty good."

","This is the text message that Colter sent to Goodwin at the end of the movie: ""Lily awoke in an evening dress in an outbroke look. In her hand were 5 playing cards. At some point today, you're gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack on a commuter train near Chicago. You and I kept that bomb from going off. If you're reading this e-mail, then Source Code works even better than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined. You thought you were creating 8 minutes of a past event, but you're not. You've created a whole new world. Goodwin, if I'm right, somewhere at the Source Code facility, you have a Capt. Colter Stevens waiting to send on a mission. Promise me you'll help him. And when you do, do me a favor: tell him everything is gonna be okay."" Correct me if I'm wrong, that this text message was sent to Goodwin in the other parallel universe (not the reality where train bombing had occur). But, I'm confused of how the person (who told Dr. Rutledge about the failed bombing) ever know about any terrorist attack towards the train? Because logically, any planned attack will never been told prior to the bombing (or did I miss something from the movie?)"
"Eternality","9","1","1","21 April 2011"," Not every film can boast the ability to connect both mind and heart with near equal satisfaction, but Source Code does it quite brilliantly.
","From the director of Moon (2009), one of the most thought-provoking science-fiction films to hit the screen in the last decade, Source Code is a taut, tightly-paced mystery-thriller in the tradition of Hitchcock's Strangers on the Train (1951) and North by Northwest (1959) – note the wide landscape shots at the start – but has its premise rooted in alternate reality, a sci-fi concept that continues to baffle even the most seasoned fan of the genre. Proving that Moon's critical success was no fluke, director Duncan Jones imbues in Source Code, a film that is intended to attract a significantly larger audience, with a rare sense of intellect, and blends it with surprisingly honest human drama.<br/><br/>Not every film can boast the ability to connect both mind and heart with near equal satisfaction, but Source Code does it quite brilliantly. Jones' film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Cpt. Colter Stevens, who used to be part of the U.S. army fighting the war in Afghanistan, but now finds himself in the bizarre circumstance of having to inhabit another person's body in a speeding train in order to find a terrorist before he blows up a series of bombs. And like every suspenseful thriller, there is a deadline: Stevens has only eight minutes to save the day.<br/><br/>Despite the deceptively simple premise, writer Ben Ripley creates a story that becomes increasingly complicated, but it is never disorienting as viewers will be only as confused as Stevens, whose struggle to piece the mystery of his existence becomes more illuminating as time passes. Like Moon, Source Code explores themes of memory, identity, and isolation. And like Inception (2010), the film alternates between ""realities"". In one ""reality"", Stevens finds himself alone in a space capsule of sorts, with the scenes' visual design reminiscent that of the moving rover in Moon. Mental isolation is also a key theme in both films.<br/><br/>Source Code, however, could have been a more emotionally potent film if its last ten minutes were not included in the final cut. The film should rightly have ended in the manner of The 400 Blows (1959) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) – that is, with a freeze frame. That would certainly have retained and encapsulated the emotional impact and cinematic brilliance of this soon-to-be sci-fi cult classic. Gyllenhaal's performance is excellent for a thriller of this nature as he communicates anxiety and confusion with aplomb. There is also so much more to his character than what usually typifies a conventional action hero, with a strong emphasis on his back story.<br/><br/>Drawing deeper into Source Code, I feel that by using Stevens as an example, the film not only raises ethical issues, but also serves as an indirect criticism against the U.S. government/military's hardball tactics to coerce detained (but possibly innocent) suspects to provide them with vital information to nab terrorists. In a nutshell, Duncan Jones has fashioned a fascinating sci-fi mystery-thriller set in the real world of today that should give moviegoers an experience to savor. Exciting and clever, Source Code is one film that you should not miss.<br/><br/>GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)<br/><br/>(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","A really good thriller, which I haven't seen for a while. The movies have been limited to such half-hearted scripts these days that it seems not much effort is being put into the writing of the film. However for once I am not disappointed for paying the money to watch this. It's such a gamble going to the movies today. <br/><br/>The film is about a soldier put into a machine that sends him back in time to relive a persons last 8 minutes on earth before their death. It's such an interesting concept and the way the movie was tackled was pretty damn satisfying, in terms of explosions and action and character depth. <br/><br/>Jake's character never had to act out great fighting stunts even as a soldier, he struggled with the entire mission in so many different ways and it puts a challenge and the thrill to the whole entire thing. I'm still 50-50 on how it ends, but still very intriguing, and if there's two things I would complain about in the movie it is how did this ""machine/technology"" come to be and what happens after the end??? such a tease really. Though I would want to know, I still would advise not to go for a sequel of some sort, it's open for a part two quite honestly, but I'm just afraid they'd ruin a good thriller after such a long time, and drag it along the dirt. <br/><br/>All in all, worth the watch."

","In terms of setting, if not style, think Quantum Leap, Groundhog Day, that sort of realm.<br/><br/>Thrown right into the story you can start racking up the genres almost immediately, with elements of mystery, action and sci-fi... as the film moves along you'll get more of them plus some romance and traces of comedy, plus a bit of philosophy to think about if you so wish. The quality of this film, the enthralling strength of it, was clearly marked by the general silence in the cinema. A few remarks early on, such as the face of the body Jake Gyllenhaal inhabits looked to us a lot like Charlie Sheen, and our being reminded of Quantum Leap (TV show where each episode saw Dr Sam Beckett occupy the body of a person in a position to ""put right what once went wrong""). In fact the latter is cleverly/amusingly touched on by the fact Scott Bakula (who played Dr Sam Beckett) has a credited significant role in Source Code! But soon and for the rest of the film, nothing but admiring silence.<br/><br/>Well filmed, well written, well acted and with a nice soundtrack, there really isn't much to fault about this film. Some scenes are a little bit cringe and it's not an especially original premise, in a general sense. But small considerations.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is very good, Vera Farmiga has a wonderfully enigmatic look in this, looking very similar to Jake's sister Maggie in fact, Michelle Monaghan is fine considering she's not given so much to do or emote.<br/><br/>I also like the overall philosophical dilemma element and the possibilities hinted at by the ending, but for those not interested in such things, no trouble. You'll enjoy the film fine in the time you sit and watch it. It's just a nice bonus that you could end up thinking about some of it's themes and possibilities for some time afterwards."

","Gylenhaal seems to be travelling down the same road as Nicolas Cage in my own opinion as one of the hardest workers in the business and most underrated. I liked Source Code as it brought action, romance, drama all to the table. Newcomer director Duncan Jones who brought us 2009's Moon brings us yet another sci fi adventure this time about a US soldier Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal ) who wakes up on a train not knowing why he is there only to find himself sitting in front of his love interest in this film Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) He has taken on a hidden identity and with much arguing with Christina that he is not Colter he bolts to the bathroom to get a hold of himself only to find he is staring at a strange face in the mirror that is not his own! The train blows up and we see he is now in a pod of some sort in a US government lab. He gets told that he has only 8 mins to find a bomb aboard this train. They send him back and forth to the scene of the crime as he goes against time to find either the bomb or the terrorist who put it there! This movie reminded me in a weird sort of way of Groundhog Day with Bill Murray most of the way through it. It packs loads of twists and plot turns amidst all the action involved. A good watch for any fans of Duncan Jones previous work. He seems to be what we will soon be calling the sci fi director of the ages!"

","Source Code has a good idea and perhaps if it was done just slightly differently, it might have worked. Jake Gyllenhaal makes a solid leading man and the premise is pretty interesting. But roughly a third into the movie a plot twist is revealed that pretty much nullifies the entire premise. All the tension goes out of the movie, because none of it matters from this point onwards.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal's character reacts somewhat erratically to the situation at hand, but you can't really blame him. But yet again the twist gives no real reason to invest yourself in this character. At that point you are left with the other side to the story. It's not really possible to divulge more without venturing into spoilers, but there is not enough to really, well, care. An alternative take does emerge in the end and is used to conclude the movie, but not enough of the script gave this enough attention to hold any merit as a hook.<br/><br/>Otherwise this is a reasonably good thriller. If you can find suspense in the inevitable, then you might still get something out of this."
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","3","6","10 May 2011"," The First Excellent Film of 2011
","In 2009, Duncan Jones got the ball rolling for a new era of groundbreaking sci-fi films with his debut feature Moon. Later that year came the critically acclaimed District 9, venturing on a similar avenue in terms of the themes it addressed and fingers it pointed. Last year, Nolan got in on the act with Inception which, while not quite being on the same interpersonal scale as the others, was a spectacular piece of cinema in its own right. Now, Duncan Jones has returned to add to this canvas with Source Code, a technological mindbender sure to incite equal parts acclaim and debate.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is Captain Colter Stevens, who wakes up on a train without the slightest idea of how he got there. While trying to get his head together, he is shocked to see the reflection of a different man when he looks into the bathroom mirror. Minutes later, the train explodes and he is re-awoken, this time locked inside a capsule. Enter Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who informs him he is part of a revolutionary project in which he is able to occupy the body of a passenger for the last eight minutes of their life. The story turns into a race against time as Colter endeavours to diffuse the on-board bomb and catch the terrorist, thus altering the future before another imminent attack can occur. <br/><br/>Sounds like a pretty straightforward action-thriller, right? Well, to divulge any more of the plot would be the most unforgivable of crimes, as the film treks in a direction that almost makes the bomb thwarting seem like a subplot. The film opens with a brilliant set piece. Everything from the setting, to the cinematography, and even the opening credits seems Hitchcockian in nature, and Source Code retains that feeling by inserting a ton of red herrings (ranging from the subtly clever to the in-your-face obvious) as well as through the characterisation of Colter, playing every bit the paranoid, inquisitive hero personified by James Stewart in many a Hitchcock mystery.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those 'food for thought' kind of movies; one that will leave you trying to decipher the indecipherable long after leaving the cinema. Perhaps the most noticeable theme is the way Jones addresses the most basic of human emotions, happiness, and asks us to make our own judgement of the relationship between ignorance and bliss. Another angle being worked here is a criticism of man playing God (see: Blade Runner, Shutter Island), as Goodwin and her team play Colter's constant overseers, directing his every move and dismissing the questions he asks on behalf of an audience desperately seeking answers.<br/><br/>For mine, the biggest flaw of Source Code was not in leaving anything out, but in putting too much in. The film sets itself up beautifully to finish with an ending that is original, intelligent and poignant all at the same time. Instead, it rolls past this point and continues on for another scene, which, in its attempt to tack a wholesome ending onto a powerful film, comes up slightly underwhelming. I don't want this to sound like an exaggeration, because it's by no means a 'cop out' ending, but it allows for a few schmaltzy one-liners that aren't in line with the rest of the film's tone.<br/><br/>Also, Source Code lacks a sense of urgency when it's really needed. Yes, Colter has to save the day before another bomb goes off, but this doesn't feel like a big enough threat, as all the while Colter is allowed to enter and re-enter the source code until the mystery is solved. Again, these negative aspects do not detract from the film as a holistic work of art. Rather, they simply keep it from being that little bit better, and maybe even pushing a perfect score.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"johngrenci61","5","3","6","17 April 2011"," Plot holes
","I am sure I am in the minority, but I can't help but look beyond the surface to determine if there are any plot-holes. And there are. Now, I accept the movie's main premise (hey, that is what sci-fi's are about) but beyond that premise there are paradoxes.<br/><br/>One thing I DID like about the movie was that it really was not an action movie. It had about 5 minutes of action and the rest was dialogue. I think 'action' is incorrectly describing this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is good. If you like sci-fi, like your imagination to run a little wild, and don't mind plot-holes, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>If plot-holes (i.e., inexplicable parts while allowing the main premises) bother you, then you might leave disappointed."
"paperback_wizard","8","3","6","5 April 2011"," A Surprisingly Original Sci-fi Thriller
","Source Code is equal parts ""Quantum Leap"", ""12 Monkeys"", and ""Deja Vu"". It has elements of any number of sci-fi thrillers, both classic and modern. And yet, it's one of the most original movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) stars as Colter Stevens, an Air Force pilot who must find the bomber of a passenger train before another, even larger bomb is set off in the city of Chicago. He searches by traveling back in time and entering the mind of a passenger who died on the train. He can only stay for eight minutes at a time, but he can keep returning as often as he needs to; as long as he finds the answer in time.<br/><br/>While his mind travels to the past, his body is locked in a mysterious pod. He communicates with the other members of the Source Code project through video; but most of the communication is practically one-way, as the leader of the project, played by Jeffrey Wright (Casino Royale), rarely answers his questions and insists on updates. It's understandable, I suppose, with even more lives at stake, but it doesn't do much for Stevens' state of mind, which is already strained by the time travel. To make things even more complicated, Stevens' begins to fall for one of the passengers, played by Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Gone Baby Gone).<br/><br/>The movie does a wonderful job of building and holding the suspense. The mystery of the bomber's identity is hardly the only mystery that needs to be solved. Who is Colter Stevens, really? How did he become part of the Source Code project? Can he change the fates of everyone, or anyone, who died on the train? What will his fate be if he fails? What will be his fate if he succeeds? The acting is another gem for this film. Jake Gyllenhaal demonstrates his range as he plays a man increasingly frustrated with the dual tasks of saving lives and discovering his own status. Monaghan is a delight to watch, as she always is, and the chemistry between the two doesn't feel at all forced, as it so often does in thrillers with romantic subplots. Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, Orphan) plays a sympathetic Air Force captain who tries to guide Stevens through his mission, and even support him when he uncovers the truth about how and why he was chosen for it.<br/><br/>If there is a difference between derivative and unoriginal, then Source Code sets the standard for defining it. The ending, I felt, may have been a bridge too far, but that doesn't change the fact that, in a culture of remakes, sequels, and adaptations, this is one of the few movies that can stand on its own merits. There are elements, as I've written, from several different sci-fi stories, and yet they are weaved together into a surprisingly original thriller.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)"
"jonnyhavey","9","3","6","5 April 2011"," The Mind: String of Cinematic Fabric
","Ten years ago Jake Gyllenhaal brought viewers into the mind of a high school student bridging the gap between universes in ""Donnie Darko."" ""Source Code"" marks parallel universes round two for Gyllenhaal as he leads a seasoned cast with his charming acting talents. Director Duncan Jones is a relatively new director, however, he has gone down the mental thriller sci-fi path before with his 2009 movie ""Moon."" This time around he takes a well written screenplay by Ben Ripley (only lacking premier dialogue exchange) transforming it into the best movie of 2011 to date. The film is unique yet familiar because of the way it is told (the replay film). Gyllenhaal's character Captain Colter Stevens embodies a man named Sean Fentress repeating the last eight minutes of Sean's life over and over. Steven's mission is to use the new technology available to the U.S. government, known as source code, to find the man responsible for blowing up and killing more than 100 people on a Chicago commuter train and ultimately preventing subsequent attacks. After waking up from his first attempt he is disoriented and confused, wondering why he is no longer in Afghanistan with his unit. To make matters even more puzzling, he is briefed by a woman named Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga, ""Up in the Air"") about his unknown ware bouts and soldier status. Stevens learns that he is trapped and his only escape is his interaction with the people on the train that is destined to explode. A minor love story forms as he becomes closer to a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan, ""Due Date""), whom in the end he cannot stand seeing her blow up again. While he learns more and more from Goodwin throughout the film, mystery still surrounds the limits the project's creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright. ""Quantum of Solace"") has put on source code and its affect on past, present and future events.<br/><br/>While many may say that the film revolves around Gyllenhaal's performance, the most important character in ""Source Code"" is Director Jones. Jones took the advanced in-depth concept within ""Source Code"" and simplified it into a short string of cinematic fabric. By doing so he took the spotlight off of Gyllenhaal opening the mind of the viewer to the simplistic detail of his fellow cast members' performances and the detailed environment surrounding them. This exemplary artistic craft can be seen throughout the film, starting with the narrow scope that cinematography allows the viewer to see to its slow expansion as plot details come to light. Jones's greatest triumph occurs during the final sequence of his film as he compresses a 3D still image into the second dimension through what can be called pure artistic craftsmanship. However, the art in the film is presented to a broader Hollywood audience and even leaves room for snippets of comic relief provided by Russell Peters's (Standup Comedian) character Max Denoff. In the end, Peters's purpose goes beyond comedy as he helps create ""Source Code's"" metaphorical undertone of happiness.<br/><br/>Even though Ripley writes one of the best scripts of the year he fails on occasion to provide the viewer with enthralling dialogue. Periodically throughout the film the characters mend their discourse saving weekly scripted exchanges. The only other faulty part of the film comes from its almost Hollywood ending, which end on more of a happy note rather than a metaphorically profound message.<br/><br/>The mental sci-fi action thriller genre is at its best as films continue to delve into the most profound arena; the mind itself. ""Source Code"" is yet another stepping-stone for the future of mental cinema and in the end is no let down. The film proves what ""Inception"" proved last year, art can be found within the scifi genre exemplifying the infinite possibilities of life, love and happiness."
"dreamflix","6","3","6","2 April 2011"," Deja Vu
","Have I seen this before? I watched the previews and went in wondering if this movie would be much like Tony Scott's Deja Vu from 2006 where the guy keeps going back in time to save the world and get the girl in the end. So, the guy actually does not go back in time, or does he? Same question I asked at the end of Deja Vu - how many times had the main character gone back in time to fix a mess? If you saw Deja Vu, then you've seen a version of this movie. It is predictable. But the action is sharper and at a better pace. Also, Gyllenhaal does a good job of bringing presence to the screen. He has that star-power (not saying Washington doesn't). Farmiga does a good job, considering you see her mostly through a small screen. She gives pointed doses of emotion just at the right times. Wright does a killer job as Dr. Rutledge. He hits a bunch of stereotypes: geek scientist, slash brilliant nutty professor, slash can't see the harm he's doing because he's buried in his experiment. The ""recall"" scenes were different enough where you were able to tolerate all of the trips back in time. A nice add-in was Scott Bakula on the phone as Mr. Stevens. Monaghan's character could have been given more substance. But in eight minutes, you get what you get. I did leave wondering why a trained military guy couldn't seem to keep hold of a gun? The conductors take it, Frost takes it, but okay. He's a pilot. Do we really like Hollywood endings so much that we end up sitting there being able to easily predict the outcome? When there's a good twist ending, it's really worth it."

"Quinoa1984","8","3","7","12 April 2011"," like a Twilight Zone episode... only a very good one, and by a strong director
","Duncan Jones and science fiction, after only two films, makes for a pretty darn good fit. With 'Moon' he had an exploration of an astronaut losing his mind on a spaceship with a talking Kevin Spacey robot as his only companion, and it was a surprisingly entertaining-but-deep exploration into consciousness and what it's like to be lonely in space. Now with Source Code he has a more traditional Hollywood film - a ticking time-bomb scenario that doubles back on itself repeatedly as a soldier (Jake Gyllenhaal) is caught up in a mission to find out where a bomb will go off on a train heading towards Chicago. It's a time travel movie, in a sense. I say that last part since Jones and his writer do something clever and unexpectedly touching with it: the character is not exactly on the train, but rather his 'self' is transplanted into the body of another man on the train, with an attractive woman (Michelle Monaghan) and he has to keep looking for clues at to first where the bomb is and second who will set it off.<br/><br/>But, as with any good Twilight Zone style story, there's twists and turns that make for an unexpected trip. What's somewhat unexpected is how much heart the director puts into the material. It's as much, if not moreso, about a man having to come to terms with his own mortality and his relationship with his father that was left without resolution before this mission. Plus there's the whole thing of 'can-you-change-the-past' kind of thing and what this Source Code could provide, which is akin to what was done in Twelve Monkeys only with more to-the-minute timing ala 24. I was drawn into the science of it, and the trickier questions of 'is this ""right""' as coming from essentially a military-prevention-weapon' stand-point (and Jeffrey Wright's character, kind of channeling Cornel West?).<br/><br/>Aside from the cleverness displayed in the plotting, which is classic in its science fiction appeal and how it deals with the mystery without too many flash and gimmicks (mostly relying on some solid supporting characters, the kind that might pop up as 'characters' in a Hitchcock train picture), the acting from Gyllenhaal is really a winner here. Maybe it's cause of what's there in the character to explore, and his relationships and connections with the outside world that were left unresolved, but he really knocks it out of the park here, as he's stuck in this chamber of sorts for half of the movie in-between when he's zapped back to the train and has to think quickly on his feet. As an actor Gyllenhaal has always had his charms, but now as he grows older with this film and last year's Love & Other Drugs he's come into his own as an actor-star. Just watch as he calls up his ""father"" on the train near the end. It's more moving that I would have ever expected.<br/><br/>Sure the film has a few minor faults with some of the supporting actors- I never believed that ""comic"" on the subway car, and the villain when he's revealed is a little too simplistic for this story- but the main story is tight and it makes real suspense out of the ""will this happen"" and then has a big reveal near the end that turns the story completely on its head. It's still a 'Hollywood' blockbuster, but it features the same attention to ""smart"" (or just not-as-crappy) science fiction that Jones showed with his previous film. I look forward to whatever he does next. 8.5/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","7","1 April 2011"," Smart and exciting original thriller with equal heart to match the brains
","Trains, brains and alternate realities comprise ""Source Code,"" the sophomore feature from Duncan Jones, director of 2009′s intellectual sci-fi dish ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell. Jones coaches a similarly terrific actor in Jake Gyllenhaal to another commanding yet heart-filled leading performance. The difference is that ""Moon"" was contemplative and brooding; ""Source Code"" moves at thrill-a-minute pace. Both, however, possess that same cerebral quality that wins audiences over.<br/><br/>A less elaborate ""Inception"" might be one way to classify ""Source Code,"" as both share this newly founded sub-sub-genre of carrying out missions in a lifelike non-reality. ""Source Code"" focuses on Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal), a helicopter pilot in the air force who finds himself inside the titular program, which zaps him into the body of a random passenger aboard a Chicago-bound commuter train that will explode in exactly eight minutes. The passenger has already died in this incident and so has everyone on the train, but as program creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) explains, part of the human brain's short-term memory still functions in a window of time after death. The source code recreates that eight-minute long experience. The idea is that Stevens can use those eight minutes to learn information about the crime and prevent future acts of terror; all other objectives are secondary.<br/><br/>Rookie writer Ben Ripley's script moves along well enough with Jones' pacing to keep our attention away from holes in the plot and the science and everything you'd expect in a film this preposterous to make ""Source Code"" a fun and stimulating ride. And although it's seemingly all about brain science, the film displays a surprising amount of heart and a unique perspective on human nature. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan ooze a certain likability that ups the ante and lets us step back from putting the plot's puzzle pieces together so that we may adore the chemistry and other gooier moments free of guilt.<br/><br/>Even Vera Farmiga, who plays the face on the monitor guiding Stevens through the process, becomes a more involved character throughout the film, which offers a nice change of pace compared to similar military characters in these kinds of offerings.<br/><br/>The story withholds a frustrating amount of information at the beginning, made all the worse by Stevens begging Farmiga's Goodwin for answers and her continued reluctant denial of them. From the trailers, you also have an idea of what the source code is all about, but not having that confirmation is tantalizing for the first portion of the film. Frustrating, but darn effective. The answers, while not presented in a miraculous twist format are unique and certainly not predictable. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that there's no source code within a source code.<br/><br/>As a Chicago resident, ""Source Code"" was both cooler and more ridiculous. From what I could piece together, I'm pretty sure this was I usually took when I was a resident of the suburbs. I can't fathom anyone trying to blow it up — it's kind of boring. The whole ""who's the terrorist?"" element of the plot, however, ranks way behind the film's character-driven objectives. We're supposed to care much more about Stevens' and his experience with the source code, not about the ultimately irrelevant context Ripley concocted to get him there.<br/><br/>As such, the film could've taken place anywhere, although Jones takes great joy in turning Chicago's infamous ""bean"" in Millennium Park into a metaphor for the film. Henceforth, I won't be looking at the bean the same way again. I will also be sure to crawl underneath it on my next visit and decree: ""I am in the source code.""<br/><br/>Even if only coincidence, great pride comes from this thrilling movie being set in my fair city. A gripping original story — no matter the size of the gaping holes in its logic or the terrible CGI used to create its explosion sequences — clearly overrules everything, and this film has the proof. ""Source Code"" offers a thinker's thriller without the headache, a story geared to sci-fi nerds with a universally appealing message at its core. I suspect some will scoff at its relatively mid-range intellectual level, but from a pure storytelling perspective, ""Source Code"" does everything right, very much in the same way (but on a smaller scale) that James Cameron's films do. Duncan Jones should now be on everyone's list a director worth keeping tabs on if he can continue to bring high-concept films down to earth.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Source Code is a great movie, the best I've seen in a long while. The plot has been talked about and I think unfortunately that has turned people off as it has been compared to Ground Hog Day and Twelve Monkeys. I don't think it's like either one of those movies. It's much better than they were. The dilemma that Colter Stevens faces is very different and unique. It's more akin to Jacob's Ladder. <br/><br/>I think that Jake was fantastic so was Jeffrey Wright. Vera Farmiga was also very good and she and Michelle Monayhan had difficult roles.<br/><br/>I have to tell you that the ending to this movie is not inconsistent with the theme of the movie and it's not stupid either It's an ending will be talked about for years.

","Source Code is a Action Sci Fi Thriller film Directed by Duncan Jones (same guy that brought us Moon, 2009) This film centres a soldier who wakes up in another man's body. He soon discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. It's starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Russell Peters, Michael Arden & Scott Bakula. #FACT: Topher Grace was also considered for the lead role.<br/><br/>SLIDER'S REVIEW: When I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to go see it. Last time I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a major role was in Love & Other Drugs and his performance there was very heartfelt.<br/><br/>When I watched Source Code I was surprised that it surpassed all my expectations, believe me when I say this is one epic blockbuster (a must see). It's one of the most thrilling rides I've been on whilst watching a film. The action is very hands on and detective like work so were exploring with the lead role, this made it very entertaining. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is as good as Inception (yep it's that good). From the moment we meet Capt. Colter Stevens on a train this film had my full attention (it just grabs you from the word Go). I felt like I started off with the main character because he knows as much as I did when the film starts so it felt like we went through understanding the Source Code together. <br/><br/>I loved the twist and turns the storyline takes, one minute I thought I knew what was going to be the outcome... then it switches. it has a very creative plot alongside the type of love story I could see developing. Parts of the film has that jaw dropping effect that just keeps getting better. I think most people who see this film will want to watch it again to understand it more or simply to just to watch it again. I loved the concept that a man could go back 8 minutes using a computer programme before an explosion in a bid to save lives. The visual effects of the explosions looked really cool to watch. The director has produced the world a smart action thriller that does its job extremely well and will be talked about for months to come. The Best Film in 2011 So Far.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal has done it again. This has got to be his best work on screen in a very long time. His character as Capt. Colter Steven was a very heart pounding person to watch. He carried this film from the moment we set eyes on him all the way to the end. He's a smart and charming man that just had everything his character needed. A Very good actor. Michelle Monaghan is one pretty woman. Her character was Christina. She plays this neatly dressed, well-spoken woman exceptionally well. I'm sure it wasn't easy trying to keep up with forever changing scenarios. The women on the monitor screen is Carol Goodwin, her character is played by Vera Farmiga. She help us understand more as the film goes along. She also is a very good actress. Jeffery Wright plays a very believable Dr. Rutledge. I for one was surprised to see Russell Peters in this film (when did he become an actor?). I have to give credit to the comedian because he does an Applausable job, surprisingly the acting seemed to come natural to him.<br/><br/>This cast was amazing as a whole."
"thursday-14","10","2","4","10 September 2017"," This is actually ""real"" Science Fiction, so a lot of people may not fully ""get it""
","The original meaning of the term ""Science Fiction"" was basically that the writer assumes some major scientific or engineering breakthrough has been made, and then writes a scientifically coherent story that illustrates the impact that this fictional development has. Most so-called ""Sci-Fi"" is NOT Science Fiction at all, it's basically Cowboy stories in spacesuits. I don't see anything at all wrong with the ending; it might be a tad too feel-good for some sad souls, but the whole point is, this is a story centered around a brand new technology that the users still barely understand; it doesn't have to follow somebody's clod ideas of ""common sense."" Apparently science doing unexpected things is only acceptable if it does the WRONG thing.... To me the most haunting scene lasted just a couple of seconds, where we saw that the previous animated conversation between Stevens and Goodwin consisted of nothing more than chatroom-like text on a computer screen. The rest was just an illusion generated by the computer."
"Shmeagol","7","2","4","2 October 2015"," An original and movie drenched in sagacity
","The majority of films today will either have an idea that they use to compel their story and have originality, or they have an idea not so unheard of but their acting, cinematography, and screenplay will make it easy to overlook. Sometimes they will have half and half or divvy it up, but it's not often that you come across a movie that throws all of it at you at once, yet organizes and flows luxuriously. With Source Code, it seizes your attention with not just action and fast cuts, it makes you excited, it makes you sad and mourn, it takes you to somewhere that puts you in the ""body"" of Gyllenhaal as he so effortlessly jumps into the shoes of a confused and real person. He makes it seem as though he was literally put in the position of the movie with no past knowledge, he resembles all of us with the fear, anger, and all emotions that come with being put in the Source Code. In a word this movie is original, yet not just a cool idea, the acting and the techniques used by Duncan make it seem more like the source code already is real, and we are just now learning. The movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good movie."
"flobri56","8","2","4","19 January 2015"," Good movie
","This movie speaks about the ability to obtain informations from the past. As said in the movie, ""it is not time travel"", it is something else. This ""something else"" is well engaged since the beginning. I was in the entire time, and it is not easy for me in that kind of movies because I analyzed everything. It is not too hard-science (like Primer for instance) nor too stupid (like Transcendance). It is more like Edge of Tomorrow where the weight of action/science/love/thriller is well balanced.<br/><br/>I recommend to see the movie if you like ""little"" mind-f***. I liked the end, even if I don't think it can be realistic, but it is unexpected and appropriated in a sense...<br/><br/>So go watch it."

","The story is kind of predictable for this type of movie. The groundhog day element gets old fast. Read the good reviews and expected more. It is just adequate - no more no less. Could have predicted the outcome from the premise of the story. It's just not very interesting and the whole thing feels repetitive and limited in scope.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan isn't pretty enough to carry this kind of show. She looks a bit pig like - a younger Marcia Gay Harden and is more of a character actress. Jake does an adequate job but anyone could have done it. Like seeing Vera Farmiga but don't know why she has to do the behind the scenes kind of HQ woman - she is young enough for a more central role."

","Let me try communicate well. Quantum parallel universes are the premise of this movie and the machine built by the physicist in the movie. The thread that the soldier asked for executing the mission is in one quantum universe. He had the opportunity to enter another quantum universe in which the explosion has yet to happen. This opportunity is introduced due to the fact that the scientist is able to capture the overlap between multiverse after seizing the brain state of Sean just 8 minutes before the explosion. Multiverse overlaps when their states match at one time instance. The scientist will be able to hold on 8 minutes of another quantum universe and call the soldier back to the reference thread, as long as Sean exits the other quantum universe in a death state at the end of the 8 minutes. Otherwise, there will be difficulty, as shown in the movie. It all occurs as planned since the soldier is called back. However, the last time the solider enters a (not the) quantum universe that overlaps with the reference universe, he was terminated at the reference thread by the captain. Once the reference quantum universe vanishes according to the soldier brain state as he was put to death at the end of the 8 minutes in the main thread, the other quantum universe departs the overlap instance and Sean continues to exist in that quantum universe with all memory acquired from the reference universe (multiverse communication succeeds). Of course, once he texts the captain in that alternative quantum universe, the captain in that quantum universe will receive the text message before she actually proceeds with the mission. In the ending, the soldier realized that and informs the unaware captain and the scientist in his alternative universe about this aftermath of a successful multiverse joins and departs that is a successful multiverse communication.<br/><br/>The movie is an accurate depiction of multiverse communication."

","Source Code fails to suspend your belief - what's required to make you want to play along with the ""who dun-nit"" aspect the director hopelessly baits you into. It's confusing and it gets boring watching the same thing over and over again. Rather than follow along, I was left questioning: ""Is this Groundhog Day or is it more like Matrix when someone pulls the plug?"" You know what happens in the end of course - there really is no surprise. Oh, and terrorists...they are everyday normal looking dudes just like you. Uhhh, the propaganda! The action is lazy - just a CGI fire over and over. The people on the train don't behave the way real people do - they behave more like SIMS characters. I think there was even a text message sent between two parallel universes - was this an attempt at fantasy as well? The train blows up and the film just blows."

","well... first thing i did after i finished watching the movie was to google this: ""what about Sean Fentress?"" and that is exactly why i think this movie is a mindless optimistic pseudo romantic nonsense rubbish series of irrelevant flirting moments mixed up with some ""action sequences"" because in the ending the good guy does not die... he gets to lives in this parallel universe or whatever mister Duncan can call it and gets the chick... and... they live happily ever after? WHAT ABOUT THAT POOR SAD LOSER FENTRESS! OR MAYBE HE WAS A WINNER! A MUCH BETTER PERSON THAN COLTER, HE MIGHT HAVE EVEN BE A LOT MORE INTERESTING! may be Fentress was going to contribute to humanity in a vastly more important way than Colter... or whatever. My point (and the point of many who have seen this flaw too) is this: How will Colter and even more importantly Christina, live happily ever after? he should have to hide his real identity for the rest of his life and never see his father again... even though he is now alive and loves the old man SOOOOO MUCH! and Christina will share her life with a body-snatcher of sorts? <br/><br/>this must be the most stupid ending ever.<br/><br/>If the movie started at the end... i mean, how will Colter manage to live in another's man body (and life)? well that is a more interesting idea than an all American life saving terrorist fighter living dead torso (BTW... that must be the saddest idea ever... when i saw the ""other"" colter still in that DISGUSTING capsule, i felt terribly sorry for him and nauseated by the whole idea.<br/><br/>I liked moon, and i thought the director was a clever refreshing new artist, even though i felt the movie was a bit pretentious, now i think this guy is just a bit mentally challenged...

The main reason is to keep flow of positive emotions.<br/><br/>Actually there are only three negative characters which do have one thing in common: They try to use reason to achieve their goals in the real world. The main negative character, the White Religious Terrorist (of course domestic terrorist, because no one wants to stop flow of positive emotions to other nations in the world) is actually only the sidekick. He is basically irrelevant, because the main theme of the movie are repeated talks with the Pretty Girl. The clues laid to the Terrorist are so obvious that you will know who he is in about 10 minutes in the movie.<br/><br/>Then the thrill is gone completely and audience will wait for the ""more"" important things: The Talks wit the Pretty Girl, the Kiss with Pretty Girl, the conversion of another pretty military girl to the cause of positive emotions and of course, total breakdown of reality in order to save Pretty Boy and Pretty Girl in some totally absurd way.<br/><br/>The movie is total nonsense on so many levels: The Pretty Boy can see parts of the virtual world where the host of original memories never went, the characters in virtual world seems to have totally free will, you can see even things that could not be expected by anyone - like how the van of the Terrorist looks like and how the Bomb inside looks like. Sorry, this is not science, this is pure witchcraft. I do subscribe to Multiverse theory but it does not work this way. If you want to watch really good scifi thriller, pick ""The Moon"" instead. Or try a give a shot to ""13th floor"" - this is thriller with similar theme, but several orders of magnitude more believable.<br/><br/>This movie is basically love story about the power of love and the power of shifting world emotion, cold military hearts and its ability to beat the death and to bent reality and causality as it wishes. So it is basically a fairy-tale. The only remote thing that might create illusion of thriller here is the Bomb. Bombs hidden in vans are not that typical for most of fairy-tales so it might confuse viewers.<br/><br/>As a ""chick harvesting movie"" it might work fine. If you can survive the flood of positive emotions and total lack of any sense, you may get your rewards after the movie. However it is total bust if you want to entertain yourself.

","Duncan Jones's 'Source Code' is such a good movie, and feels so fresh and original because it actually concentrates on the art of true cinema, photography, editing and timing, rather than CGI driven action and effects.<br/><br/>even though a true sci-fi story, the directorial style of Duncan Jones feels more like works of Hitchcock than most sci-fi fare. even though the science fiction is good speculation and highly imaginative, the real focus is on unraveling the mystery and creating different levels of suspense.<br/><br/>it seems rare these days when a mainstream fantasy film is more about the acting, screen story, and photography and editing, than a lot of showy CGI effects that always look like CGI and create somewhat of a stylized appearance. 'Source Code' was more about building mood than numbing the audience with big, flashy effects.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones delivers some of mainstream filmmaking's more intelligent, thinking fantasy films. although not as good as his film 'Moon', 'Code' is still a thoughtful and intelligent fantasy experience that probably has more in common with DePalma's Hitchcock homage 'Obssession', rather than sci-fi like 'Inception' or 'Star Trek'.<br/><br/>for myself personally, i always like a film that is authentically a film and doesn't rely to heavily on something like a large budget, star power, or gimmicks, and use them as a crutch to avoid achieving any real inventiveness or clever plotting and structure. 'Source Code' is definitely that kind of film and Duncan Jones seems to be that kind of filmmaker. genuine and original, relying on personal inspiration and imagination rather than showy, flashy tactics."

","Source Code is now added to my top 20 all-time favorite movies.<br/><br/>This movie is excellent - if you like sci-fi. If you don't like science fiction, then this movie can't help you. You must be able to take a leap of faith with the premise of this story.<br/><br/>Why this movie is fantastic and deserves your time: 1) Quick-start. The action begins the moment we fade-in. The very first frame of the movie - that's it, game on. And don't think this is the typical gimmick of then going into flashback so we can see the ""setup"" for the action which started the story. Oh no. We simply jump into the middle of the action. The story has already started, and we're barely grabbing on for the ride.<br/><br/>2) Pacing. The hero does everything you want him to do, exactly when you want it, in the right way, at the right time. Sometimes confused, sometimes determined and forceful - always in the same frame of mind as us, the viewers. At no time was I waiting for the hero to ""catch up"" to me. And at no time was I left behind while the story raced ahead of me. It's a writing skill I greatly admire.<br/><br/>3) Characters. They are all believable. They react to situations the way you think people should react. You never ""see"" acting. You never say to yourself, ""Oh come on, nobody would say that."" Not in this movie.<br/><br/>My mind was engaged every step of the way through this thriller. There's no time to rest. And there's no filler scenes.<br/><br/>This movie has been compared to many. Source Code really stands out on its own, and is superior to most. If you liked or even mildly enjoyed some of the other movies to which Source Code has been compared, you should love this. Enjoy."

","Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-<br/><br/>1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is a fine actor. He has portrayed the character of Colter Stevens, an American Army helicopter pilot, quite well if in not the best way possible. Vera Farmiga as Goodwin was convincing and looked appropriate in her place. Michelle Monaghan too acted well but her character had far less exposure and she had not a lot to do.<br/><br/>For me the real winner here is the director, Mr. Duncan Jones, who has really put together a wonderfully captivating show. Definitely worth your time and money."

","Another in a longish line of high-concept mainstream movies. In many of those movies it's fashionable to have a confusing story which people will interpret as being brilliant/genius and which has an in-built ""repeat"" viewing factor due to the baffling nature of the story which has just been told. Think movies like ""Inception"".<br/><br/>""Source code"" is a far superior film to ""Inception"" but will probably lack the kudos of the latter. Briefly, the story concerns a commuter (""Colter Stevens"", played by Jake Gyllenhaal) on a train who has an identity crisis. Before he can resolve it, he dies with all the other passengers in a massive explosion. Afterwards (!), the man awakes in a weird chamber where he is questioned by military (or some such) personnel about who caused the explosion. Don't worry, this is not a 'spoiler'...it's established very early on in the movie that this is what has happened. <br/><br/>Of course, you get questions along the lines of ""Which reality is real?"". Going with the sci-fi explanation (involving secret military experiments) you have a plausibility to the scenario which is very nicely unambitious and may in fact have some science (perhaps speculative) to it...involving information retained in the brain post-death...some 8 minutes...which gives rise to another gimmick of the movie...the character reliving those 8 minutes in order to solve the mystery of the train explosion. The latter part of the scenario may be hard to rationalise as remotely plausible, but I just ran with the premise...perhaps it might have been a more plausible story if the movie didn't go down that path...a more 'realistic' science fiction, perhaps.<br/><br/>This is a great story which seems to have no loose ends to it, at least on one level...the film makers provide you with clues as to what is happening and you aren't left high and dry like similarly themed movies can do. <br/><br/>P.S. on reflection, the part of the movie dealing with 'reliving' the 8 minutes of memory in the way that they did, did strike me as being a loose-end/plot-hole...but you just enjoy he ride at the time.<br/><br/>A lovely, dark, morbid fantasy.<br/><br/>If you like this movie, some movies etc. with similar themes include:<br/><br/>12 Monkeys (film) The matrix (film) Dark city (film) Groundhog day (film) Assassin's Creed (video game...personally I don't find the first game in the series to be fun to play...the sequel is much more playable)."

This of course has some violent scenes typical for its own stretched-out plot of a time bomb set on a train and afterward the possibility a citywide holocaust. Jake's acting has been driving and very involving. Michelle Monaghan is cute. She did it well and much relaxed. Though the mystery is easy off since the crime perpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the movie, the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence is stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has go to be a love story. The ending surprisingly is most rewarding and would bring you to several what- if's and how-come's.

This movie is not for everyone. This is definitely not a film which can win Oscars. acting is not an extraordinary as the script does not require actors to push themselves more. I gave 7 because it was predictable."

","Duncan Jones directed 'Source Code' is amongst the most entertaining films I have seen in recent times. It's Gripping, Confounding & Intelligent. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal is absolutely superb in here.<br/><br/>'Source Code' is a sci-fi action-packed thriller, centered on a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man and discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train.<br/><br/>An interesting premise, 'Source Code' succeeds by holding your attention from start to end. It keeps you hooked on to it completely. Ben Ripley's Writing is Razor-Sharp, and Duncan Jones directs this flick with style. Cinematography is stunning. Editing is perfect.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal, as mentioned, is absolutely superb in the central part. This performance easily ranks amongst his finest works. Michelle Monaghan is satisfactory. Vera Farmiga is expressive, as always. Jeffrey Wright leaves a mark.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Source Code' is Super-Entertainment. An Ideal Pop-Corn Flick, that is Worth Your Time and Money. Two Thumbs Up!"

","Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie and director of 2009's critically acclaimed Moon, returns with his second feature length film Source Code.<br/><br/>It stars Jake Gyllenhaal playing his usual charming hero self as Captain Colter Stevens, whom is connected to a program named the source code which allows a person to take over someone else's body in the last eight minutes of their life. Captain Stevens is connected to the program in order to find out who blew up a train outside of Chicago in order to stop a second attack.<br/><br/>Cleverly written and brilliantly directed with obvious Hitchcockian influence, the film in fact is such a thrilling ride that the sentimental ending that takes it a little off track wont bother you in the slightest.

","POSITIVES:<br/><br/>1) The idea is brilliant
2) The film is only 90 mins long and takes place almost entirely in the same 2 settings; this makes the film magnificently focused
3) I genuinely welled up towards the end when Colter calls his father
4) The mix of high concept sci fi and terrorist thriller is really good<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>1) I hate when films spend their first 3 minutes doing the credits over random shots of scenery
2) I don't think the threat of the terrorist attack was focused on enough. Other than one tv screen of cars trying to escape Chicago, the impact of the terrorist attack is never really felt
3) While I actually quite like the idea of the ending, the fact that there is no explanation to the ending is infuriating"

","Jake Gyllenhaal is quite convincing as the army captain ""Colter Stevens"" working on a secret military programme whereby his consciousness can be implanted into the body of another - but only for eight minutes at a time. When a bomb goes off on a commuter train he is tasked with going back - via the body of a teacher - to try and piece together what happened and apprehend the perpetrator. before it happens again. The one thing he cannot do, is prevent the explosion but as he continues to go back, time after time, he develops a fondness of a fellow passenger ""Christina"" (Michelle Monaghan) and so he decides to establish just what he can actually do to help save her from her fate. His operators - Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga have other plans for him, though, and as that realisation sinks in he must take perilous risks to break free from his digitally induced ""Groundhog Day"". It does lack pace; the very repetitive style of the storytelling negates the otherwise well paced urgency of the plot, and can grate after a while - at times it seems like quite a long 90 minutes. It's conceptually quite clever, however, and worth watching."

","The movie is about a man stuck in a situation that he doesn't understand at first, assuming that he needs to be debriefed, since the last the last thing he remembers was being on a mission. He soon discovers that he is inhabiting the body of someone else, later to find out that he is doing it over and over for the span of 8 minutes. His mission: find out who bombed the train.<br/><br/>This is the weird part. The bomb already went off, so how can he revisit and explore the world where something has already happened? I gave this a 9 instead of 10 because of how poorly the writers explained this, so I understand why some people couldn't swallow what I think they the authors were trying to convey in the rewrite.<br/><br/>At the end, the movie would have been just great, perhaps a classic, if the main character's last moment was frozen in time, a snap shot of everyone in some sort of bliss. Instead, our main character is alive. Not only is he alive, but is able to leave a residue in what is assumed to be the true base reality. The only hint the writers gave us is that our main character says, ""Tell Dr. so and so, that he unleashed something bigger than he realized"" or something to that effect. The story should have made slightly more clear that we all have within us all the information of the local universe, so for that 8 minute heat impression left by the hand on a surface analogy, that universe can be explored in so far as it could be in real life. People that didn't like the movie, but still liked the Matrix, kept their mind too closed."

","Remember those problem solving enquiries back in school, where Train A leaves Station A at 45 MPH, and Train B leaves Station B at 35 MPH, and if the stations are 60 miles away from each other, when will they pass? Well, those problems just got a lot more complex, challenging and exciting, in this case: Train A leaves Railyard A at 70 mph, only to find out that, it's carrying a bomb, onboard that could kill everybody. How long will it take for the hero to stop it before disaster strikes? Well, hopefully in 8 minutes, because that is the time, that Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is given, when he woke up, in somebody else's body, determination to change a past event & save the future, by figuring out, who the bomber is, at least, until he fails and dies again. If this sound very complicated to understand and somewhat very confusing to you. Then, you're right! This movie directed by Duncan Jones & written by Ben Ripley, indeed, left a lot of viewers, scratching their heads. They were asking the same questions, you probably asking yourself. Like, how exactly does the source code, projects eight minutes of alternate realities with complete personalities and identities, by only using the memories of the recently demise? Also, if they only have eight minutes of memory, how can they create new memories in alternate state of being? To add to that, how is there, a number of Stevens in a multiverse of quantum worlds timelines within an uncertain state of existence? Best of all, why is there a Dunkin' Donuts on a Metra train? That was odd product placement. All good questions that the film, sadly doesn't answers. The plot is a bit muddled because of that. It's as if the theories of the Human condition & Quantum mechanics were mush into a sealed box with SchrÃ¶dinger's cat; while the big bang is constantly, happening around it. I can see, some people getting turn off, by this mucho jumbo science nonsensical premise. There is a lot of plot-holes. Plus, it is somewhat hard to keep up, especially with the director & writers's crazy train of weird thoughts. Like me, it will take you, multiply watches to figure out, at least, the basics on what the hell is going on, with this movie. Despite that, if you willing to stay tune, you would find the TV Series, 'Quantum Leap' meets 1993's film 'Groundhog Day' meets mystery novel, 'Murder on the Orient Express' action, very entertaining, even if the CGI is not the greatest. While, parts of it, are highly Deja Vu repetitive. Each loop sequence is unique enough in its small changes to stand out on its own; which is good thing. Jake's performance is wonderful as the guy trying to figure, everything out. He really did look disoriented. Also, I don't know, if it was intent, but there was some humor that came along with the many of ways, Colter can get himself, in and out of trouble. All the reactions, by the surrounding cast involving him, made me laugh hard. The secondary characters for the most part, were very well played. First off, Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren is one attractive, intelligent, funny, young woman who's you as the audience is able to warm up to the most. She really does have somewhat chemistry with Jake Gyllenhaal. You really wanted to see if Stevens can indeed save her. As for Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin. She was not as believable as a serviceperson, as she should had been. Her character doesn't well trained, passionate or really that professional. Something was just off with her performance. Despite that, she didn't take me out of the movie. As for Jeffrey Wright, once again, he really master the role of innovation tech genius, so well. However, that has left his career as always being typecast as one. This is no differences. This film, like many sci-fi thrillers of the past, plays on societal issues with technology and it's potentially dangerous implications to the world. Not only that, but the film is also somewhat spiritual. I like the symbolisms of death, limbo, and rebirth with the cloud gate. However, I found that force happy ending a bit odd, seeing that Colter essential effectively murdered the real Sean and stolen his identity & his girl. In fairness, either way, the real Sean would still be dead. Still, that's pretty dark. Despite that, I still truly dig composer, Chris Bacon's music for this film. He put a very Hitchcockism sound & feel of suspense to this flick. Mad props to him for that. Overall: 'Source Code' is one movie worth getting aboard with. It's a fun watch, even if it's goes off the rails, a bit. Highly recommended."

","""Source Code"" tells the story of a soldier, who awakens in a strange structure and is sent into parallel realities by a misterious army unit he hasn't heard before.

As time goes by, he notices, that he doesn't get all the information and that this program could implie a lot more than he originally thought.<br/><br/>The film is overall very well done. It managaes to show the same scenery time and again without getting boring or become repetitive. There's an element of mystery and an element of action that I like really much. The weak part of the movie however is the sci-fi background of the plot. Where other films present believable conditions, this one really only has a wider thought of what technology could be used to achieve what the film depicts. That way the believability of the movie gets bent pretty much and in the end it feels a bit like some of the usual phrases of love and positivity have been pressed into a Sci-Fi plot. <br/><br/>All in all this is a great realization nonetheless. It is based on some interesting thoughts, presents a thrilling plot and a lot of mysteries and is by far on the better end of technology romances."

","Source Code is a film directed by Duncan Jones. I had this film on the back of my mind. So I decided yesterday night to actually watch the film. And man, I was highly impressed.<br/><br/>Plot: Colter Stevens is sent into a computed reality to find a bomber on a train.<br/><br/>Story and direction: I have seen many time travel movies but none like this. The concept was fantastic. Kudos to writer Ben Ripley and director Duncan Jones for successfully creating a world where this is possible. Every second is utilized properly. Never do you feel bored in this 90 minute film. Also the characterization is so perfect. For every minute of the film, you feel for your lead character. You are connected with the character on screen. Also, I didn't see any sort of trailer for this film, which was an added advantage as I could enjoy the film very nicely. Also the editing was razor sharp and crisp. It felt like a nice flow, which is what makes a film believe-able. The cinematography is awesome too. But there were some flaws for me. The VFX was a bit fake. I could know in some scenes where green screens were actually used. Also towards the climax, the film felt a little bit cliched.<br/><br/>Performances: Jake Gyllenhaal has always impressed me and he cotinued to do in this film too. He acted his role so perfectly. Michelle Monaghan was also good for the part given to her. Vera Farmiga was also impressive. The complexity given to her added a different layer to her character that accentuated her performance too. Jeffrey Wright was good too. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: No spoilers, but there is a phone call scene during the climax of the film which really touched me. That displayed Jake Gyllenhaal's character at his peak.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film was a great use of my 90 minutes. While watching the film I was never bored. This is a highly recommended film for those who like mind-bending movies. I assure you it is worth a watch.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8.5/10."

Honestly it's just a great movie. People can complain about the loop holes or how a lot of things don't make sense but honestly this movie is fantastic. The story is fast paced and keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat. I love the chemistry between Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Christiana (Michelle Monaghan) but the chemistry between Stevens and Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) is even better even though they are never on screen together. Although these three actors are some of my favourite actors around at the moment, especially Vera Farmiga!.<br/><br/>It's just heart warming how much Stevens cares about Christia, which it something you don't expect from an action movie, you really want him to be successful even though you know his chances are bleak. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie and love action movies watch this instead of wasting your time on like a fast & furious movie! You won't regret it I promise!<br/><br/>8/10"
"jamesrupert2014","7","0","0","1 September 2017"," OK time-loop story but not as clever as it pretends
","The premise of ""Source Code"" is that Gyllenhaal's Colter Stevens character can replace the last eight minutes of consciousness of a person who is about to die. The person in question is killed in a terrorist bombing of a train, and Stevens is tasked with repeating the eight minutes continuously until he identifies the bomber. The clock is ticking, as there is a second bomb to be found and Stephens' subjective eight minutes is eight minutes in real-time. Similar to ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and ""Groundhog Day"", this is a time-loop scenario where the traveller gets to learn from his mistakes and enters each new iteration with a fresh perspective. Despite an early implication that Stevens' only has eight minutes regardless of what happens (in one case he is hit by another train as the 8 minutes end), later it seems that he can go on beyond eight minutes, as each iteration creates a new, alternate reality, and he finally creates one where the bomb is defused and the terrorist captured. Unlike most time travel scenarios, creating alternate universes at decision points doesn't necessarily create paradoxes, but there are some issues conveniently ignored by the writer (and characters): what happened to the consciousness of the person whose body Stevens took over (especially in the 'new' reality where Stevens appears about to live out his life in the requisitioned body) and since the 'donor' didn't die in this 'new' reality, how/why would the source code work (I guess that this is similar to a time travel paradox - you can't save the person as they have to die to enable you to save them)). There is a freeze-frame scene at the end of the last 'eight minute' that teases you into thinking that that is how the movie ends (Stevens frozen in a time loop where he, and everyone around him, are happy) â€“ then the movie continues into the 'new reality'. IMO, closing on the freeze frame would have been a much better ending."
"RubenJansen97","7","0","0","21 January 2017"," Source Code is an above average movie that could have been better, but the final result is fine. 7/10
","Characters and acting: First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal has proved himself. He's great in the role. Everyone else if fine. There isn't much character motivation or development, but characters are likable or understandable. There isn't much emotion though, except for a touching scene that (minor spoilers) involves a conversation between a character and his/her father.<br/><br/>Story and dialogue: The story is what makes this movie. It's awesome and original. Despite some plot holes near the third act. The dialogue is fine, but sometimes there is too much exposition or the lines aren't exactly 'human'.<br/><br/>Editing and pacing: Nothing spectacular or outstanding, but it does the job well. Let's say you wouldn't notice it anything good or bad.<br/><br/>Cinematography and effects: Some really nice shots in this movie, but others are lacking. With some beautiful wide shots, but on the other hand some dark, barely visible shots. The effects aren't the best, but the movie doesn't rely on them, only uses them when necessary, they are fine for the size this movie has.<br/><br/>Deeper meaning or motives/themes: Barely any, perhaps something that has to do with free will, or being human, but that's not really addressed.<br/><br/>Tone: Mysterious, suspenseful.<br/><br/>Emotional response: I was invested and excited. Wanted to know where the story would go. <br/><br/>Rating: Source Code is an above average movie to watch on an evening with friends. Don't expect a great movie but a fun movie. 7/10"

In this film, Jake Gyllenhaal is a soldier that wakes up in someone else's body and through an experiment by the government, he has got 8 minutes to find the bomber in a train. When the bomb goes off and Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another time, yet still cannot find out anything. This sequence is repeated over and over again, until he is able to complete the mission, cause if he does, he is in in fact, changing the reality of today. A little bit like what happens in back to the future 2. The movie has tension, drama, and has an uncertain ending. All of it make for a movie that may not have you on the edge of your seat, but that is intense enough to make you alert until the end."

","An explosively paced, cleverly narrated & expertly executed sci-fi extravaganza that's intriguing, exciting & engaging, and packs in just about enough twists n turns to keep its viewers around for the majority of its runtime, Source Code is a fascinating mix of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, energetic camera-work, tight editing & apt performances, and is one of the most rewarding films of its year.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, the story of Source Code follows a US Army captain who inexplicably finds himself aboard a commuter train which explodes only minutes later. Regaining consciousness in a pod this time, he learns that he's a part of an experimental government program that allows him to relive the final 8 minutes of a victim's life repeatedly, and is tasked to find the person responsible for the bombing.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by Duncan Jones in what's only his sophomore effort, Source Code invites its viewers to take part & solve the mystery within the 8 minutes window again n again, and is another winning entry in the career of this promising talent. The plot structure is slightly perplexing but the intuitive manner in which Jones presents it to the audience allows them to invest in its premise and keeps them interested till the very end.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal chips in with a highly compelling performance and single-handedly steers the film past the finish line. Michelle Monaghan & Vera Fermiga also contribute with fine supporting work but their characters aren't as well-defined as Gyllenhaal's. The film gains momentum early in the story and, thanks to its dynamic camera-work & skillful editing, keeps its moments tense & thrilling for the remainder of its runtime.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Source Code is an intelligently crafted brain-teaser that delivers a healthy dose of quality entertainment, remains intensely gripping throughout its runtime, and is a welcome example of its genre that's sharp, riveting & satisfying on more levels than one. The only glaring issue I have with it is that it steps over what would've been an ideal conclusion and chooses to finish on a hopeful note. Nevertheless, Source Code is a thrilling ride that refuses to slow down until it reaches its final destination, and comes definitely recommended."

The movie plot is set in the city of Chicago, America and whole movie ends in a day. The movie corresponds to thriller, mystery, Sci-Fi, adventure genre. The movie is of about 95 minutes and pace of this movie is bit fast.<br/><br/>The movie was about a man who don't know why he was exists.It is like he slept a night before and now he was living someone else body and some other place. Everything that is happening around him, was not related to his life. He was struglling for truth and he has limits because he doesn't has that much time. <br/><br/>The plot in this movie is based on cognitive thinking. The limited scope to live in that world for completing the mission was good and it is a very nice concept. the concept on which movie is based is very new concept and it is very unique too. Cinematics of this movie were very pleasing and environment looks very calm. When the movie started by the half an hour it is very difficult to understand what is going on but after some time, the story goes on and finally plot unveils the climax. The ending of the movie is the best part of it . I can't comment about music and sound effects used in this movie but they were good. I think it is future to our human universe. Watching the movie provides the audience with an insight and a journey into the world of Science Fiction consisting of cognitive thinking which cannot completely be expressed through words but by experiencing it live."

Sounds confusing I know and I hate describing plots in movies so lets just leave it at that.<br/><br/>Source Code is very entertaining. Well shot and well directed for the most part. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an exceptional performance as well, as his reactions to the situations seem very natural in an otherwise unnatural situation.<br/><br/>Before going in to this film let me tell you that its the mystery plot that keeps you invested. You are continuously curious about the situations Gyllenhaal is put in. About the time loop that keeps happening. Its the kind of story that relies on plot to keep you in rather than characters, since aside from Gyllenhaal, no other characters really pull you in.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with the film is the ending, which I won't spoil. Its one of those endings that right before the last 5-10 minutes wraps up in a nice bow and everything seems to make sense. Then right at the last couple minutes it takes a complete turn and now everything you thought you knew turned out to not be true at all. Your left questioning things. Its like in a horror movie when the main characters finally kill the monster but then it turns out its still alive right at the last shot of the movie. whats worse is its not nearly as smart where it could leave clues to figure out what the ending really means.<br/><br/>It just doesn't work in this kind of movie.

He feels disorientated and confused as a pretty passenger opposite called Christina (Michelle Monaghan) acts like she is his girlfriend and refers to him as Sean.

His mission is to identify the bomber who was on that train as he plans to set off a second larger bomb.<br/><br/>The simulation repeats itself and each time he gets to know more about the people on the train and possible suspects.<br/><br/>There is something Hitchcock like about this film as Colter finds himself in a position he does not largely understand and something more dangerous elsewhere is going on and people are relying on him to come through. His controllers back at command reluctantly give him small nuggets of information as Colter tries to figure what is happening.<br/><br/>The film might not be entirely original but it has enough sci-fi and thriller elements to be entertaining because Gyllenhaal sells it well helped by Monagahan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright."

","I don't get why women get all goobery about Jake Gyllenhaal. He's always looked like he needs a shave and a shower. Gyllenhaal plays the main character in Duncan Jones' Source Code, an almost-always well-plotted and coherent alternative-reality thriller. Whether or not his character, a (dead?) US Army helicopter pilot, needs a shave or a shower is ultimately immaterial. Gyllenhaal's Colter Stevens is a man tasked with finding out who is going to set off a nuclear device in Chicago, and he has to do it by repeating an 8 minute segment of time on a doomed commuter train.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into any more detail about the story line simply because I still don't completely understand it. What I do understand is that Director Jones and his screenwriter, Ben Ripley, have created a compelling story of one man's torment as he begins to realize that many, many lives depend on him suffering a fiery death over and over in order to find out how to stop a greater act of mayhem. <br/><br/>Although at times the movie devolves into slickery and silliness, Source Code is not insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Don't get me wrong--this is not a deep movie filled with emotional significance, but it is thoughtful and earnest. SC wants you to be intrigued, but being involved will do just fine. I feel a kinship with any movie that has enough IQ and EQ to make me want to rush back to see more when I have to step out to deal with reality. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal might lack a bit of subtlety at times and Michelle Monaghan seems too wholesome and trusting, but the viewer simply can't stop caring about them. Throw in Vera Farmiga as the US Air Force officer who pilots Stevens through his ""passes"" on the doomed train, and the viewer has a full set of sympathetic characters. Farmiga's Captain Goodwin is a mix of professional focus and empathy, and there are more than a few instances of her struggling with not revealing to Stevens his true condition.<br/><br/>By the end of Source Code, I was unsure and confused of and about certain aspects of the story, but I could forgive the occasional attacks of murkiness for the general feeling of satisfaction. Throw in my acceptance of a regularly unkempt Gyllenhall and there's been a good reason to blow 90+ minutes."

","The Source Code is not bad, but not great either. It works for what it is. It's one and two dimensional in which it only scratches the surface for the subject matter it is speaking about. A much better movie that goes deeply down the rabbit hole on this kind of subject matter and explores limitless possibilities is Mr. Nobody with Jared Leto. <br/><br/>Again though, the Source Code isn't bad, it makes for an interesting story. The acting is good by Jake, and Vera, and a little over the top cheesy by Miss Michelle, but still not bad. <br/><br/>At one point in the film Jake's character talks about if he can change the train accident from happening would that alter another world and Jeffrey Wright's character said no, in which Jeffrey Wright's character was wrong of course according to this movie. Basically though through the Fifth Dimension, the mind, Jake's character creates a parallel universe and even a multiverse. In the so called 'real' world, Jake's character is dead, Vera's character is probably imprisoned, and so forth and so on. <br/><br/>But now in this other multiverse, Jake's character is still incubated, Vera and Jeffrey's character no nothing about any bomb threatening a train, and so forth and so on. Then in the other dimensional world, Jake's character lives happily ever after with Michelle in another man's body. Very smart and great concept, but again, only scratches the surface. Still not bad to watch though."

","The underlying premise is really interesting, but the materialization is at a few points in the movie annoying to the point of being excruciating.<br/><br/>We have a soldier in the U.S.A.F. who finds himself in an inexplicable and highly perturbing situation. Yet, it is explained to him in no uncertain terms the critical nature of his mission. Hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of lives depend on him efficiently and methodically finding a bomber and possibly thwarting his/her nefarious designs.<br/><br/>Instead, the guy goes off-track on silly ""side-missions"" (finding out what had happened to his real self, or Frenching his leggy companion on the train), and engages in interminable dialogs with mission control.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the beginning and especially the end are superbly done. It is poignant without being schmaltzy and cheap. This is the first movie in quite a while I can gladly recommend.<br/><br/>For those of us interested in quantum physics, watching this was a boon.

","This is a movie that is about how humanity desires to go back into the past to change one event so as to make life better for us all. A US pilot wakes up on a train in a body that is not his own and at first must come to grips with the double identity that he appears to be living. However this only lasts eight minutes because then the train explodes, and he awakens, again, in a dark room with voices asking him if he has found the bomber. It turns out that he is being sent back in time, using an invention just developed, so that he can live the last eight minutes of somebody's life, and during that time, attempt to uncover the truth behind a horrid tragedy.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this film subconsciously explores that desire we have to be able to change the past. While what is happening in the movie is allegedly unchangeable, buy unraveling the secrets the powers that be believe that they may be able to unlock clues so as to enable them to prevent an even greater tragedy in the future. The problem is that the guinea pig is clueless as to what is actually happening.<br/><br/>Another aspect is about control, and how we inadvertently give up our lives into the hands of the powers that be for their own malicious intent. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is that guinea pig, and I will not reveal too much about him so as not to destroy the movie, but we do know that he has his own wants and desires, but these have been taken away from him so that he might be able to serve his masters.<br/><br/>It is not necessarily the case that these masters of Coulter's are inherently bad, they are just domineering. It appears that Coulter had no choice in taking up the role that he has taken, but we do see two sides to his reality, one in which he is in prison, and another where he is free, but this freedom only lasts a short time until he is snatched back to his prison. Therefore, in another sense, this movie is a prison break movie, but on a different level. The prison that he is trapped in is the future, and the escape route that he has to take is into the past, however it is only the eight minutes, and the inevitable death that he must face at the end of those eight minutes that keeps him trapped."

","For its second feature, Duncan Jones chose to remain faithful to a genre he seems particularly fond of : science fiction. And what's great about the English director is that he doesn't rely on a pompous, muddled science fiction, piling up information, it's always relatively easy to understand and that's one of his strength.<br/><br/>He proves it once again with Source Code, which plot is clear and interesting, very well executed, dynamic and directed in a very sober and efficient way. Jake Gyllenhaal, probably one of the best actors of his generation, is impeccable, accurate from start to finish, even though his character didn't seem to allow him to give his best.<br/><br/>Although the movie is overall good, the happy ending (imposed by the studio ?) is a bit of a letdown, it feels too contrived, especially compared to the frozen instant in the train that would have perfectly concluded the story."

","Source Code is a grabber of a premise, and Gyllenhaal is well cast as the unprepared observer trying to understand what's happened to him (the last thing he knew, he was flying a helicopter in Afghanistan) while being forced to repeat those same eight minutes over and over. Eventually, he decides to deviate from the program and try to save the life of a fellow passenger (Michelle Monaghan), even though she's already died in the bombing.<br/><br/>Source Code's themes are similar to those in director Duncan Jones's previous film, Moon, and it has many of the same flaws: once again, he lays out the clues to key plot points so laboriously that we can figure them out ahead of the characters, and the naive existentialism falls apart if you think about it for any length of time. It is a film in which you must pay attention to properly understand the concept. <br/><br/>It's watchable in spite of itself, and Gyllenhaal and Monaghan are great together. Source Code delivers the necessary thrills and suspense one would look to enjoy in a thriller. Although the film moves pretty quickly making the time go by rapid. It could have been a little longer in length. ==================================================================== ====== 
After a rewatch (03/01/17'), this film is more than great this time around. There are more subliminals and I had a better understanding of the film's concept in whole this time around. Source Code is a well crafted thriller and the short runtime (1hr, 33mins) works quite well in its favor. It allows every moment to be crucial and everything happening is quite important as the film doesn't drag or include any unnecessary or unwanted subplots that we are used to seeing in other films like this. The cast is great and everything is well connected in the end. Source Code reminded more of Edge of Tomorrow in a sense, as well as Unknown with Liam Neeson. Overall, this film is one of the greatest sci-fi films of this decade and is highly recommended, rating change to 9/10. On another rewatch 09/02/18' Source Code remains fresh and intriguing on multiple watches. Highly recommend for those still in the dark having not seen this film."

","Source Code is a very interesting little film. It follows in the footsteps of films like Deja Vu, Inception and Looper (although Looper was of course released afterwards). And one of the things these films have in common is that they raise a lot of questions and discussion after you've seen them. So I came to the IMDb message board for Source Code expecting nothing different. However what I found there, in comparison to the other three films, was different. The whole movie wasn't so much being discussed, but simply the ending. And the general question that kept coming up, which I admit had occurred to me also at the time, was 'does the ending make any sense at all?' <br/><br/>Now Source Code is a mystery thriller, which is a lot of fun to try and work out, so I'm not going to spoil the ending for you. I'll simply talk about the implications it had. Firstly, it must be said that an ending that gets people talking at all is an accomplishment. After all, isn't that what every filmmaker strives for? Christopher Nolan ended Inception brilliantly by leaving a huge gaping question for the audience, rather than giving a definitive answer. Although he did leave clues throughout the story for us to go back and work out the answer for ourselves. Here, director Duncan Jones takes a different approach. He gives us a clear and absolute ending, but the clear ending he gives raises more questions than answers (an achievement in itself). Personally I didn't like it and thought (along with a few others I've talked to) that it should have ended at a particular point a few minutes earlier. I think you'll know which point I mean when you watch it.<br/><br/>The ending aside, Source Code is a pretty entertaining, well produced and well acted film. Right from the start we are hooked into the mystery the main character finds himself in. We both find out information at the same pace and it makes for fun watching. There's a whodunnit aspect in there, which never takes center stage, but makes for a nice little addition to the story. Jake Gyllenhaal carries the film pretty well and Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga provide good support throughout. Definitely worth a watch this one and I'll let you make up your own mind regarding the ending."

","""Suspension of disbelief"". It's an agreement between viewers and the people who take it upon themselves to entertain us. We all know its fake but put that aside for the short time they've asked for our attention. In this latest Jake Gyllenhaal film, that agreement is stretched to its absolute limit and for some, beyond. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal plays army captain Colter Stevens who's suddenly found himself on a train across from woman who keeps referring to him by another name. Additionally, she's talking to him as if she knows him. After a relatively short time the train meets with a catastrophe and Stevens is in a confined area staring up at a monitor being asked to explain the events. Still struggling with memory issues, he's given the assignment, ""find the perpetrator"", and returned to the same situation. This series of events occurs several times in a way that would more likely remind many viewers of Vantage Point, assuming there are many people who saw it. That said, it isn't intent on inspiring a debate on the time traveler's paradox or parallel universes. It's a whodunit adrenaline ride made to entertain and it does just that."

","I so wish I could give a higher rating, since the film was almost really, really good. The idea was brilliant - almost hackneyed but just sufficiently novel to make me want to keep watching. The action was excellent, the intrigue was just at the right level and the acting was highly credible (well, apart from the Dr Rutledge character).<br/><br/>But since when we leave a cinema, we are most-closely reacting to the end of the film, I have to say I felt really cheated. I've seen dialogues from other commentators explaining how the ending 'might work', so I don't want a tit-for-tat argument there. Maybe like me, they desperately wanted the ending to be at least as good as the rest of the film. But my over-riding experience was of a writer who gave up - just didn't know how to end the film, and hoped against hope that the primary idea would carry the film through. Not dissimilar to the episode of Dallas where Bobby's not dead, but alive, having a shower and the previous 493 episodes were just a dream! Such a shame - maybe for many the sense of 'anything in a scifi film can happen' will be enough. For me, I felt hugely let-down."

Seriously, Gyllenhaal and Farmiga work perfectly, and Monaghan is also a great female lead (though this movie doesn't pass the Bechdel Test). I wasn't a big fan of Jeffery Wright, and I felt he could have been cast better.<br/><br/>My favorite shot in the film is towards the end and consists of a slow pan through the train while everyone is frozen in place. It's wonderful to watch and quite amazing to think about. One of the only downfalls of the movie was how they ended with Gyllenhaal's character.

","This film becomes less and less sensible as it progresses. At first, it is semi-plausible to believe the ""source code"" technology allows the protagonist Stevens to enter the last 8 minutes of the teacher's (Fentriss') reality (assuming enough of his brain survived to do so). I can also buy that Stevens is actually a vestigial body being used by a utilitarian government. While the film is pretty solid in facing up to the utilitarian use of this man's life/mind/body for the sake of the greater good, things unravel around the whole ""alternative universe"" angle. First source code allows Stevens to re-enter the last 8 minutes of Fentriss' memory, but then from there he is somehow able to explore the world, discover a bomb in the bathroom, and even track the bomber to his van and get the license plate number. Really? This was all somehow in Fentriss' mind? How did those facts get there? Or are we to believe that ""source code"" can actually create alternative realities? I'm sorry, but that is too ludicrous for me to suspend my disbelief. In fact, at the end we are to believe in two, maybe three realities. In one, Goodwin pulls the plug on Stevens, letting him die after his last 8 minute session. But that leads to a second reality in which Stevens ""survives"" as Fentriss, having foiled the bomber's plot. We also see Goodwin receiving a text message from him, which may or may not be a third reality, as Stevens body is still in a box, awaiting source code's activation. That last bit begs the question: which is the real Stevens then, the one in the box or the one walking around in Fentriss' body? And what happens to Fentriss in that 2nd/3rd reality? Are we supposed to be oblivious to the fact that he has suddenly just been wiped out to make room for Stevens? Are we not supposed to care about him at all? Doesn't that make Stevens just as utilitarian and selfish as Rutledge? It's just too bizarre. The whole cult of technology goes overboard here playing Creater God and just leaves one puzzled."

So, when the science starts getting more and more complicated and making less and less sense, it's a problem. I didn't really care how Jake Gyllenhaal was doing these things or what the scientific implications are, except that the movie kept trying to make me care about them. I liked the suspense and action of the first hour, and the more emotional route the film takes in the last part. But all this silly science kept getting in the way, leading to an unsatisfying ending that has little to do with the humanity of the story. I should also note that even though MOON was derivative in a lot of ways, this felt less original to me. It is a mildly enjoyable entertainment, well-crafted and refreshingly brief. But none of it really lingers with me, and the cast is entirely lackluster."

","""The film is a saddening bore, for she's lived it 10 times or more!"" Duncan Jones must really have some daddy issues, to disregard his father's words like that. Here he has Jake Gyllenhaal reliving the same 8 minutes in order to find a bomber. It's a great premise, and I'm not one to be offended by the casual use of science nonsense. This is no Moon. This is Jones doing a Hollywood film. He certainly does it better than most, and bravely explores the character of Gyllenhaal rather than the bombing itself. Unfortunately, his character is not one I particularly liked. I get what they were going for, but he was a whiny irresponsible man. He didn't seem to care about the lives of so many civilians, and was able to solve the case pretty darn quickly when he put his mind to it. Wright was simply horrible though. A terrible performance of hammy cheese. I have no idea how anyone acted opposite him, it's like they dragged a cartoon villain out to fill a vacant role just seconds before filming. His mannerisms, voice, dialog, and general presence, all really annoyed me. The pacing was the key to enjoying this movie. It had enough going on and a decent amount of time was spent exploring each plot strand. Highly enjoyable sci-fi hokum."

","...this sophomore (though not at all sophomoric) outing from Duncan ""Moon"" Jones shows great promise of his becoming as fine a director as his father is/was a musician/actor. It also proves that screenwriter Ben ""Species III"" Ripley has come a long way. Basically a clever riff on ""Groundhog's Day"" by way of ""The Matrix"" and various other alternate-reality stories, ""Source Code"" limns the efforts of its hero to avert a catastrophic terror attack by way of placing his consciousness within the (somehow) reconstituted/recovered/restored eight minutes of memory of a victim of a preliminary incident on a train. How all this came to pass must be accepted as a given, but if the viewer is willing to do this, a very engaging tale awaits being enjoyed. Although rooted in an interesting intellectual plot line, ""Source Code"" is, at heart, a very human story involving questions of identity, purpose, and responsibility.<br/><br/>Story aside, the film's success rests primarily on the shoulders of Jake ""Donnie Darko"" Gyllenhaal, whose performance is appropriately involved and involving; he's really turned into a fine actor. The support work is equally of a piece, no complaints there; Michelle ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Monaghan, Vera ""Orphan"" Farmiga, and Jeffrey ""The Ides of March"" Wright all turn in excellent performances. Jones appears to really know how to get the best out of his cast (not to mention the rest of his production team), and I look forward to his next project, whatever it may be. Recommended to all fans of quality science fantasy, not to mention well-crafted film."

","I believe none of this quite works - as in Super 8 recently, but in a different milieu of sci-fi - because the filmmaker takes from where these ideas have already reached us in the most polished, perfectly processed way possible, and therefore with the deeper insights already airbrushed off; so it's all a tepid rehash with nowhere to go, the nested realities from Inception, the endless returns from Groundhog day.<br/><br/>The techno mumbo jumbo that explains away the mechanisms that we need to know all takes place in the bits between the action. So we literally emerge from plot to be informed about our place in it and how that placement - enforced from above - ripples up and down. Up, there is the military-secret government complex, itself evil, battling evil. Down in non-reality is the hapless schmuck looking for where that evil is rooted. The War on Terror stuff make it seem hopelessly broad-minded, but I suppose money minds were looking to capitalize on the 10 year anniversary since the terrible event.<br/><br/>Oh, of course our guy forms emotional connections in that non- reality that are supposed to challenge real/false boundaries; and will provide the framework about coming to terms with loss and the faith in transience beyond.<br/><br/>It's all lifted from the warrior lore that has driven holy war since before Islam, but fancied up with a bunch of gibberish about quantum physics; so the warrior commits himself to jihad - meaning in its original context, a struggle in the service of god - with the promise of death after life, only to discover upon completion that the heavenly abode does wait for him with rewards. <br/><br/>So, a spiritual insight is attempted but the problem is that the notions do not align; what essentially our protagonist should have been searching for is his mirror, someone like himself another pawn in devious schemes, and through this self-discovering, self-destroying journey gain understanding of the controlling powers above; instead he merely discovers a caricature of petulant evil, and remains clueless about the extent of the evil above that wouldn't grant him even death. <br/><br/>It's rather insipid overall, with mechanical workings about the karma that moves its universe. We're led to believe it all ends with a moment frozen in time - a call for appreciation of the small pleasures - but then it doubles back to move forward. It's either a dishonest camera or it was lying all along, like it did about the face."

","I was going to warn you about spoilers, but this movie can totally be described without spoiling a thing.<br/><br/>I had no reason to think that Source Code would be any good. Eh, I take that back. Duncan Jones directed and I sure did like Moon a few years back. It wasn't perfect, but seemed thoughtful and well shot. No complaints, just good movie times. Add to that the fact that I had seen Insidious earlier and really a day can't get much lower than that. So I headed to my favorite beer bar then tried out a new Mexican joint. Delicious nachos, 4 beers, and a mojito later, I was back at the crack- head Regal Cinema. I swiped my Regal card and got a free ticket for next time. Excellent.<br/><br/>I settled into a mostly empty theater (oh yes!) and got ready. Buy Coca-Cola, popcorn, and a car, then the trailers. I can't even remember the first one. What I do remember is seeing the dreaded peaked logo and whispering ""Nnnnnnoooo"" as Summit entertainment popped on the screen. The Beaver? So this is what hitting bottom looks like for Mel Gibson. A few more Summit trailers and it dawned on me – I didn't know anything about this movie but 8 minutes, Duncan Jones, and Jake Gyllenhaal. This is supposed to be a sci-fi, special effects driven movie. Summit can't even get vampires right. Pointy teeth, that's it, and they still can't pull it off.<br/><br/>I was sad and a little angry.<br/><br/>But I soon forgot I was tricked into seeing a Summit production. Technical pseudo time-travel, wormhole, quantum mechanics movies tend in one direction – overly complicated. In theory all of these things are very complicated but you don't need to weigh down a movie by making up analogies to explain concepts that the film makers probably have no understand of to begin with. Source Code was a breath of fresh air in this regard. There was a discovered plot line - we learned more about Gyllenhaal's character a little bit at a time, all the way down to the last minutes of the film. We learn more about the technology that made his time-travel possible to the point that it was fairly obvious what was going on, but not explained enough to create bothersome plot holes. The big reveal wasn't done to shock you, but was part of an incredibly touching sequence that embodied hope, perseverance, and love. Worries over Summit special effects were unwarranted – the story was more of a romance than a big explosion blockbuster.<br/><br/>A word on Jake Gyllenhaal. He was great in October Sky, I laughed at his ridiculous character in The Day After Tomorrow, and after that I felt like he got a bit too big for his britches. When did this guy become a critically acclaimed actor? What could have possessed him to put on a stupid British accent and ruin Prince of Persia? In all fairness, Bruckheimer ruined PoP by twisting the story so much that there was nothing left of the engaging games that inspired the movie. Gyllenhaal really went down on the hate meter with his performance in Source Code. It was subtle, passionate, and injected just a little bit of humor throughout the film.<br/><br/>I forgot about Love and Other Drugs until just now though. Hate meter is reinstated by romping with Clowny Hathaway.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a fun flick that was worth the price of admission. I can't wait to see what Duncan Jones cranks out next!"
"dierregi","8","0","0","26 April 2011"," An ethical journey into basic emotions
","""Source code"" is a complex movie. It has been described as an action movie with a twist, exploring a territory similar to ""Inception"". Although it is partly that, I see ""Source code"" more as a very original journey into basic emotions.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Source code"" is more ""Groundhog day"" with a twist than an action movie. The plot in a nutshell: Gyllenhaal plays Colter Stevens, a marine whose last memories are fighting in Afghanistan, who wakes up in the body of an unknown man. This man is travelling on a train leading to an unknown city. Looking at his reflection on the window, Colter sees the face of a stranger, rather than his own.<br/><br/>That must be an extremely scary experience, but worst is to follow. The train explodes sending Colter into a capsule, where he is debriefed by a female officer. She tries to convince him that some unlikely science can connect him to the last eight minutes of memories of a guy named Sean who died on the explosion and that his job is to go back to the train until he can find the terrorist who planted the bomb.<br/><br/>This set up is intriguing, albeit highly unlikely, except in SF world. But what gives away the real plot is the fact that Sean is travelling with an attractive female friend, named Christina, and very quickly Colter's mission turns into trying to save her, while getting to know her better.<br/><br/>The terrorist plot can easily be left aside. Indeed, it is left aside also in the movie, as anybody can easily guess who the terrorist is. The viewer should focus more on what is really going on with Colter and Christina. They both are likable characters and we hope against ""logic"" that there might be a future for them. The investigation part of the plot fades in the background, while we start rooting for the main characters and hoping their lives will somehow be spared.<br/><br/>Luckily, being this a SF movie, logic can be easily defeated. Another twist of the improbable science could send the epilogue into a direction more convenient for Colter and Christina. And still, we are left doubting about what really happened and in which dimension."

","I dug Source Code. For one thing, it was a sort of funky take on the question of Free Will; that there's a discernible ""afterimage"" to events, of which the crux can be derived as a kind of source code; and that the compiling and running of that source code can produce multiple possible specific outcomes. As with Groundhog Day, Colter is very much the Random Factor in that program. The one truly free man! I enjoyed it very much. The surprising thing was that, ""gimmicky"" though it might be, it develops the storyline around the gimmick with aplomb and even a kind of verve; the writing is excellent.<br/><br/>The backstory; of an ultra high-tech anti-terrorist program; at first sort of put me off. But I came to realize this movie was not a peon to rarefied, big-ticket technologies designed to save America from a comeuppance. It seems to transcend that, and so redeems itself on this point.<br/><br/>Anyway, watch and enjoy!"

","Extra spoiler warning.<br/><br/>The titular name refers to a military project to utilize a (fictional) medical phenomenon: the brain of the deceased contains the memory of the last 8 minutes before death, just like a close circuit security TV surveillance video. If another person's brain can tap into these 8 minutes of ""security tape"", imagine how much good can be done in crime prevention? Research has brought this to the brink of success. The main criterion for the candidate is compatibility to the ""object"", things like gender, age, physical built. There is one other, which will be revealed later (more spoilers!!) <br/><br/>The movie opens with an immediately attention-gripping score accenting on timpani and brass sending your heartbeat on an acceleration course. The visual is a sequence with overhead shot of sprawling Chicago cross-cutting with a cruising, sleek looking commuter train.<br/><br/>As we get into the story, movies such as ""Surrogates"" and ""Avatar"" come to mind. Colter Steven (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up, as if from a trance, in the train and finds that he occupies the body of a man named Sean, talking to a woman called Christina (Michelle Monahgan). As we move along, another movie registers itself: ""Groundhog day"". The train blows up and Steven finds himself back in the experiment chamber as the candidate for ""Source code"" mentioned earlier, about to be sent back again, again and again until he finds out who blew up the train.<br/><br/>It is important to point out here that the plot is not about time travel. The explosion has occurred and everybody on the train is dead. This is ""time reassignment"", whatever that means, as explained in the movie. Steven's mission is not to prevent the train explosion or to save anybody, but only to find out who did it because the perpetrator has something much bigger planned: to blow up Chicago with a nuclear device. Steven's mission is to save millions of lives in Chicago.<br/><br/>This suspense alone is already material for a good thriller but then there is a parallel suspense plot. This unfolds only slowly as the story progresses. What we see on the train is in a sense an illusion. But there is another layer of illusion: Steven in the enclosed experiment capsule wired into an electric circuit connected to Sean's dead brain (not unlike the protagonists in ""Surrogate"" or ""Avatar""). Other than the experiences in the train, the only recent recollection Steven has is doing a sortie in Afghanistan as a fighter pilot. In the project ""Source code"" capsule, he keeps asking his contact officer Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), whose face he sees only on a monitor, how he has become the candidate of this project. The ominous truth comes out only gradually and this has to do with the one other criterion that I intentionally omitted to mention at the start. More SPOILER! You see, like Sean, Steven is technically dead and just kept brain-active by a life support system. Once his assignment has been accomplished, he will be ""allowed to die"".<br/><br/>It should now be evident that from this clever plot, a superb movie can be constructed. One has been. The thrills are expected. But there is also poignancy in many ways. The lovely, warm, sunny smile on Monahgan's face makes it convincing that Gyllenhaal's character falls in love with her and wants to save her, if not anybody else, from the explosion. Cliché yet touchingly handled is the remorse of a son for unkind words exchanged with his father in what unfortunately turns out to be their last conversation.<br/><br/>There are also larger matters, moral and philosophical. Ruthless project director Dr Rutleger (Jeffrey Wright) suggests to Steven that he should be happy and thankful for this last chance to serve his country - ""patriotism is not everything, it's the only thing"" (thanks coach Vince)seems to be written all over his face. Steven in turn asks his own question in the train, to Christina as well as to some other passengers, ""What would you do with the last minute of your life""? The ensuing scene is the most poignant of all.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is at his best portraying Steven in a complexity that befits the unimaginably complex situation this character finds himself in. Monaghan does not have much challenge in this movie, but melts the audience's heart just by being there. Wright's performance is impressive, even as a somewhat stereotype character. It is Farmiga, however, who deserves special mention. Starting out as quite impersonal, she skilfully let the caring person underneath gradually emerge. While the billing suggests otherwise, she is really the lead actress in this movie while Monaghan is only support, in terms of the demand of the character. But as support, Farmiga is arguably even more deserving for an Oscar nomination than in ""Up in the air"". Hope she gets one.<br/><br/>Have I missed anything? Obviously: the most important! If this movie is not one of time travel and changing the past, what is all this about Steven trying to save Christina and then, later, stop the bomb on the train? Well, there can be a good solution. In the timeline of the story, Steven, through the project ""Source code"", finds the information needed and the criminal is apprehended before he can blow up Chicago. The train explosion is something that has already happened and Steven is allowed to die. That is how the movie goes. But in the parallel universe (a theme just as popular as time travel, as fans of Isaac Asimov know), the bomb is stopped and the protagonists live happily afterward. That is also how the movie goes.<br/><br/>Why doesn't it just stop there? The movie makers unfortunately don't have the good sense to stop when things are going well, and add on something that makes an otherwise almost-perfect movie end in an irreconcilable mess. Pity!"

The acting was great and it was damn entertaining. And on top of that, I like sci-fi, specially if there's a human story amidst the action. And this is a film that has the potential to make you reflect about life, reality, philosophy and all that which is great. However, I left the theater feeling a bit disappointed, maybe even cheated? And here's why... In my opinion the film was doomed from the beginning. I'll elaborate; emotionally the ending was quite satisfactory, but in order to have a emotionally satisfactory ending, I feel that the story was compromised. <br/><br/>Why was it compromised? Because the ending was too far-fetched. Granted this is sci-fi, you had to suspend your disbelief from the get go but the ending was just too convenient if that makes sense. Even for someone who's somewhat familiarized with multi-verse theory and things like that. It's a bit hard to talk about this film without spoiling it and I don't want to give anything away so, in conclusion, it's probably a film worth seeing for all sci-fi fans but for everyone else it might be just an average piece of work.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","9","0","0","23 April 2011"," A surprisingly intelligent and dense sci-fi thriller.
","I'll start this off by saying that I love Moon to death, and while I trusted Duncan Jones, after the first trailer for Source Code I was just expecting something very ordinary and disappointing. This is the part where I say that the movie surprised me in every way almost immediately. It is highly intelligent, quite unique and, like Moon, really catches you off guard in the last act with a lot of emotional weight. The story seems standard at first: Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is part of a new military program entitled Source Code, which has the ability to send him into the body of another man within the last eight minutes of his life. The life of this man is ended by a bomb planted on a train, and Stevens has to figure out who the bomber is so they can stop another imminent attack. Pretty immediately, the audience finds out that Stevens has no idea what the Source Code is, and can't remember anything beyond being on a helicopter with his unit. This is where the film starts to hit it's finest aspect.<br/><br/>While the whole mystery of the bomber on the train is always intriguing and you find yourself playing along with Stevens, checking out every passenger and trying to figure out which one of them is a snake in the grass, the story outside of the Source Code is what ends up being the ultimate mystery. How did he get in this program? Where the hell is he? Who is this beautiful woman (Vera Farmiga) whose motives are hard to discern and the mad scientist (Jeffrey Wright) looming behind her? As much as I enjoyed the scenes on the train, the most interesting part for me was by far everything between the flashes back to those eight minute rushes to stop the explosion again. The film never stops moving, whether you're on the edge of your seat trying to figure out what he can find out on the train before it explodes, or you're on the edge of your seat praying that he can put the pieces together of what the situation in his real life currently is. Instead of getting bogged down in exposition explaining all of the complex aspects of it's logic like Inception did, it goes the exact opposite way by turning that need for an explanation into the most exciting mystery of the film.<br/><br/>The final act is an insane rush, throwing out a ton of turns and real ""Holy..."" moments that had me just desperate for more. The film is a real piece of science-fiction brilliance, another phenomenal entry by Duncan Jones into a genre that has really been slacking this past decade. Gyllenhaal is an actor I always find really likable, but rarely see displaying a lot of emotional strength, and this role is pretty much perfect for him. He gets to show off those classic American protagonist chops for the most part, constantly keeping you with him all the way and even providing some nice little bits of comedy, and then in the last half hour he hits some real high points of emotional depth. It's a great role for him and he nailed every beat. The rest of the cast is a little lacking, but the characters aren't all that deep. Farmiga, always impressive, does what she can with a role that works mostly underneath the surface, as the audience is never allowed to know exactly what's in her head. Wright pours on the looney toon act a little thick and I never understand why characters like this are allowed to be in charge of anything, and Michelle Monaghan surprisingly gets you invested in her romance with Gyllenhaal despite not having a lot of layers on the page for her character.<br/><br/>I really wasn't expecting much going into the film, and my low expectations allowed me to be knocked off my feet by how great Source Code ended up being. With a solid lead performance by Gyllenhaal and some excellent sci-fi twists and turns, it kept my heart pumping and my head racing all the way until the end. The ending was a little too schmaltzy for me, but that's easy to look past when everything else was such a rush. There's a lot more actual science-fiction than I was expecting, which was a great surprise since the trailer for the film made it look like it was mostly going to be this action flick on a train. It's definitely a great film on it's own, a nice companion piece to Moon and all around just a phenomenal sophomore picture from Duncan Jones, proving that his first work was no fluke and he is one of cinema's best new talents."

His mission is to uncover the identity of the terrorist who bombs the train in 8 minutes.<br/><br/>Source Code is a fast-paced, tightly-plotted and gripping movie with adrenaline-pumping suspense, touching moments and surprising twists. Although similar events are shown over and over again, more and more conspiracies, secrets and twists are revealed each time Colter is transported back and forth between the train and the high-tech isolation unit. Thanks to Paul Hirsch's deft editing and the 8-minute time limit which adds urgency to the mission, our attention is held from beginning to end.<br/><br/>What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live? Christina would make those seconds count and Colter would kiss her again. The message of the movie is that we should make good use of every second of our lives so that we have no regrets. I am touched by Colter's telephone conversation with his Dad and his attempt to save everybody in the last ride.<br/><br/>The movie is not flawless. First, not every idea makes sense when you think back. For instance, where is Sean's soul in the end? Second, the love between Colter and Christina can be further developed. For example, at which moment and why does Colter start to fancy Christina? Besides, Christina may not truly love Colter, which makes the ending less touching. Third, it is unlikely for Goodwin, an army officer, to help Colter. She may risk life imprisonment.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's time to stop thinking too much. Just lie back and enjoy the thrilling ride in which you can enjoy a cocktail of sci-fi, crime and romance."

","From the beautiful opening shots of Chicago to the final gasps before the closing credits, Source Code keeps a grip on you. At first I felt like I was watching a weird rip-off of Inception, but the farther I got into Source Code, the more I wanted to see. There's enough humor in the dialog to keep this from becoming a mindless mess of science-y talk (like Inception was at parts) but enough twists and turns to make your mind reel over what just happened again and again.<br/><br/>The concept that drives Source Code was obviously well thought out and throughout the film there's a preciseness in the acting that rings strong. Honestly, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Colter Stevens may just beat Leonardo DiCaprio's performance in Inception.<br/><br/>There are two great things about Source Code that I want to point out. One is how smoothly the plot flows, considering how complicated the movie's concept is. Two is the soundtrack. The music truly drives this film along. If you listen carefully, you'll realize that the soundtrack sounds like a train chugging along. It made the action more intense and the sad moments even sadder.<br/><br/>There was only one fault I could find in Source Code. It feels like it needed more time to be made. They left one noticeable plot hole, and occasionally they would forget a minor detail in the repeated pattern Colter Stevens is supposed to live through.<br/><br/>All in all, Source Code is well worth seeing, and I recommend it as one of 2011's best movies (so far, at least). This movie deserves far more praise than it's gotten.<br/><br/>As a side note, if gore makes you squeamish, you may need to cover your eyes a few times seeing Source Code."

","This film was really good I thought the acting is there and so is the script both well done. The only criticism of the script I would say is the theme it has been done before with 'minority reports' with Tom Cruise and 'Dejavu'with Denzel Washington that's why I only gave it 7/10, but still definitely worth watching. Duncan Jones pulls an excellent script together- top producer and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are both good actors and play their parts well in the film. The ending is really good as you don't expect Jake to review back to the team an 'addition' to what the source code can achieve I thought it was a good turn. I would imagine there will be a 2nd source code being produced soon I think it will work as the ending was left un- answered and open."
"Polaris_DiB","8","0","0","16 April 2011"," By golly I think he's got it!
","Whereas it still may be too early to tell, I think Duncan Jones has GOT IT.<br/><br/>This is a man who knows science fiction. He has currently made two of pretty much the best examples of the genre, but more importantly, he's doing it in a way contrary to the way most contemporary directors are trying to shine within genre filmmaking: he is not subverting it, mixing it, trying to rise above it--Duncan Jones is sticking to his premises and plying all the rules with a straight face. He is very referential, but takes care that the references are only gentle homage and that he uses them only if they fit the purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>Let me put it this way: if this movie was made write-by-committee to be the genre film it is, the initial premise would become gimmick once several obvious options for flat and uninspired twists appear in the narrative, in the hopes that it would dazzle enough people to make money before everyone noticed that it doesn't make any sense. If it were made in the manner most contemporary but famous-name directors do (Nolan, this is me glaring at you), it would not keep itself contained to the science fiction and thriller aspects of what it's doing. Most importantly of all, however, the key is that what underlies everything going on here is a strict focus on the story. Anything else that doesn't fit, Duncan Jones doesn't do.<br/><br/>Here's what I mean. Both Moon and Source Code involve an initial premise ripe with the danger of gimmick: in Moon, a man becomes slowly aware that he is a clone with an expiration date trapped on the Moon all alone; in Source Code, a man becomes slowly aware that he is a dead soldier being used in an experimental form of crime prevention involving quantum physics-based time travel (there's a bit of dialog in the movie that argues its not time travel, but for all intents and purposes, it is). In either movie both the premise, and the reveal that explains it, is delivered and clarified within the first third of the movie, with very little time wasted on exposition. Jones is not holding cards up his sleeve to wow the audience with magic tricks, he's laying out the hand early and letting the characters work with them. The rest of the movie follows their attempt to deal with their situation using whatever tools they have available. It's BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>He's also keeping it small. Moon takes place entirely in a few sets with only two actors. Source Code is much bigger, but is still contained to, basically, a train, a train station, and a government facility. I would not be surprised if Jones' movies keep getting bigger, but I would be surprised if he loses his economy of sets, characters, and conceits. The point I'm stressing again and again is that this guy cuts out all the fat.<br/><br/>Now comes the inevitable ""but"". I have to admit that there's a little more to be wished for in terms of the heavy, and his motivations. Since the story is much more focused on Gyllenhaal's character and his attempt to work through the very circumstance he finds himself in, it did not give Jones a lot of room to give much detail or development to the bomber that the character is eventually supposed to capture. The result is a rather lame high schooler who has just seen Fight Club for the first time and happens to have access to radioactive material. A little bland, I must say.<br/><br/>But you know what? I don't care. This movie was great. If Jones peeved me in any way, it's in the attempt to differentiate the concept from time travel from the explanation given, a concise enough pseudoscience explanation operable for establishing the story if not entirely accurate itself, when he already refers in some sequences (especially the end) to movies like La Jetee (which I KNOW Zowie Bowie is aware of, considering his father's music video which is a direct spin-off of that film), which have pretty much established mental memory morality plays as a legitimate form of time travel long ago. That's the the time-travel geek in me getting a bit uppity, is all. I love you D-Jones, keep working the good work.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","0","15 April 2011"," Lots of brains translates to an overall great film
","My faith has been restored that great movies will come out in 2011. Source Code is a highly original and fantastically well structured film from the director of the hidden 2009 gem, Moon, which to anybody who hasn't seen it, they are missing out on a major feat in science fiction as an art form. But Source Code is something entirely different. Our protagonist is Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on a train and doesn't know who he is or how he got there. He tries to make sense of all of his surroundings and just as he gets oriented the train explodes when a bomb goes off. Flash to a dark undisclosed location and Colter now finds himself waking up from something like a dream while a woman talks to him from a monitor screen. Colter quickly learns that he is part of a military project called source code which allows him to relive the last eight minutes of the life of one of the passengers. Through this technology Colter is supposed to find the bomb and the bomber in order to prevent a second attack. Plenty of other intriguing subplots develop and the film has a lot to offer, spanning a wide field of socio-political issues. The movie is smart, fun and even a little emotional.<br/><br/>This is a surprisingly quiet film for something that is, in a way, categorized as an action film. But is more of an art film action flick that is significantly smarter than your average film of this nature. The story is very involved and there is a lot going on, and a lot to keep up with if you want to get the full effect from the film. The film impressively is able to please the simpler of movie goers with its suspense and action, while also appeasing the crowd that is looking for more thinking than just an hour and a half of escapism. Thus the film, for me, kept my brain working and my eyes glued to the screen, anticipating where exactly the film would lead. I can be easy to tell where some of the bigger aspects of the film are headed, but there are many different smaller parts of the film where you can't be too sure of how exactly it is going to unfold. Because of this I was very satisfied by the end of the film when everything was resolved excellently, while still leaving enough unanswered questions to keep the mind juices flowing. In a nutshell, this movie is smart.<br/><br/>Ben Ripley, in his feature film debut as a writer does an excellent job on the script here. I wouldn't say it is the highlight of the film, but really there is nothing inherently wrong with any of the dialouge or any of the characters. The character of Colter has some great moments and there is some very well written dialouge between him and the various characters he interacts with. He plays a fairly existential role as the film explores the out of body, out of mind experience and gives it a sci-fi twist with the source code explanation. But he is a character who has to play a part in almost two separate realities simultaneously as he constantly jumps back and forth between the train and where the military is holding him in order to conduct the source code project. It is very interesting to watch how these two entirely different locations create this fascinating story, and it all fits together so well.<br/><br/>Source Code is one of the best of the year so far, and with the next month or so's lineup for movies, I think it will stay that way, I'm sad to say. But it is OK because Source Code is an excellent film with a lot of brains, and plenty of flare to stay interesting. The story never falters and it never wastes time with any useless subplots. Every little thing plays a role in bringing the story to an excellent close, and overall an incredible story is woven, and everything is executed just right. It can be a little slow at times, but the film is fairly low key overall, except for a few moments. This film doesn't pack too dramatic of a punch, but it is simply just a good film that was made very well and provided for a much higher level film experience than what I normally receive on a trip to the theater."
"moviexclusive","8","0","0","15 April 2011"," There's heart and intelligence in this highly recommended sci fi action thriller
","This thing about alternate realities has been making us think a lot these days. Concepts of time loop and multiple worlds have left us mystified, if not perplexed, about the possibilities of another one (or even many) of us existing in another space. And what better devices than science fiction thriller movies could we turn to, to explore these beguiling ideas? After the success of his debut feature Moon (2009), English director Duncan Jones is back to impress us with another engaging production that will leave you wondering about the existence of another you in another time frame.<br/><br/>Instead of a one man show (you have to admit that having Sam Rockwell as the one and only cast member in Moon was an ingenious move), Jones has an ensemble to work with this time. The story's protagonist is a helicopter pilot whose last memory is a flying assignment in Afghanistan. He suddenly finds himself in a commuter train and has assumed the identity of another man. Eight minutes later, the train explodes and he finds himself in a pod. It is then revealed that to prevent an impending bomb blast, he has to go back in time to relive those eight minutes repeatedly until he finds out the identity of the bomber.<br/><br/>Wasting no time to explain unnecessary details, the thriller plunges into the action from the very first scene. With a screenplay written by Ben Ripley, Jones (also known as the son of rock star David Bowie) has managed to deliver another action thriller that entertains, without leaving the viewers feeling dim witted. The concept of this mode of time travel is fascinating enough to compel audiences – it's no walk in the park like 1993's Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, as our hero is fighting against time to prevent another tragedy from happening. As absurdly outrageous as the plot may sound, the movie still makes you go along for the ride.<br/><br/>One main reason why you'd have your eyes glued to the screen is male lead Jake Gyllenhaal's on screen charisma. After his somewhat lackluster performances in 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Love and Other Drugs, Gyllenhaal wants to let you know that he is back in form. Here, he is a man who is on an urgent quest, one that showcases the handsome star's ability to capture your attention. His commendable performance is complemented by the pleasant looking Michelle Monaghan (Due Date) as a fellow train passenger, the ever reliable Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace) as a scientist with a motive, and Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air) as an air force captain, who manages to shine despite her role's limited scope to stand out.<br/><br/>The film has also managed to avoid the trap of being drearily long. Its very serviceable runtime of 93 minutes is enough to leave an impact with your mind. Viewers who are familiar with how the average science fiction or action movies tell their stories will be pleased with how the last third of the film plays out. When the end credits begin rolling, you will be awed by the cleverly inventive script. Without giving away too much, you may also find yourself appreciating how scientific concepts of alternate realities and time travel are essentially humane in nature.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

","It's rare to see such a fast paced, compact, and beautifully woven movie these days. While the plot device is out there (it is sci-fi, after all), the movie offers just enough explanation to satisfy the hard core techies without bogging the whole movie down. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering what will happen in the next 8-minute loop to the main character. Jake Gyllenhaal and the rest of the cast did a great job here humanizing the characters and making this a movie more about the people than the background or the mission.<br/><br/>This movie would have been a 10/10 if only the ending were a bit better. As it stands, it is a feel good ending, but if it ended 5 minutes earlier at that crucial scene on the train (for those of you who have seen it, you know exactly the moment I'm taking about), I think this would have been a perfect film."
"PWNYCNY","6","0","0","15 April 2011"," An intriguing movie but has its flaws.
","Beware of the movie that relies too much on flashbacks. Such movies usually lose their continuity as the audience is asked to re-watch scenes that have already been shown. A good movie is one in which the story movies forward. Flashbacks can actually assist in this process, but only to a point. And when the flashbacks further include material that are intended to mislead or confuse, like personality switches or the reworking of scenes already shown, the results can be a confusing mess, which is the case in this movie. This would like making a movie like, for instance, Gone With The Wind, but instead of opening the movie at the beginning with Scarlet entertaining her suitors and then proceeding form there, the movie opens with Rhett leaving Scarlett followed by a series of flashbacks revealing in bits and pieces what went wrong to try to keep the audience guessing. GWTW is not a sci-fi movie, yet the principal is the same. The movie offers an intriguing idea and tries to make a go of it, but it bogs down and it doesn't take much effort to connect the dots. By the third flashback it's obvious that the main character is being used for something and is not too happy about it."

","Inevitably, ""Source Code"" will be compared with ""Groundhog Day"" since both deploy the same plot device of repeating the identical time period with slight but important differences. However, whereas ""Groundhog Day"" obviously replays a 24-hour slot and is a whimsical comedy, ""Source Code"" revisits an eight-minute slice and is a sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>At the heart of ""Source Code"" and rarely off the screen is the very watchable Jake Gyllenhaal as US Army captain Colter Stevens whose task is to prevent a dirty bomb exploding in Chicago. On either side of the code are two women: mission controller Captain Colleen Goodwin, played by Vera Farmiga (who was so good in ""Up In The Air""), and fellow train passenger Christina Warren, portrayed by Michelle Monaghan (whom I last saw in ""Mission: Impossible III"").<br/><br/>Writer Ben Ripley has come up with an intelligent and intriguing script, although - like so many sci-fi movies located in our world - it does not pay to analyse it too much, while British director Duncan Jones (who once went by the name Zowie Bowie) has translated this into a taut tale that is both exciting and entertaining."

","Everything in the movie was good untill the last 10 to 15 minutes of the movie. Going by the end part of the movie, this movie does not make sense at all. In one scene captain colleen tells colter that there was a train bombing at 7.30 in the morning and he should prevent the further attacks which are going to happen. But at the end of the movie we hear someone telling to Dr. Rutledge that there was an attempt to blow up the train at 7.30 am but the attack failed. We know that colter saves the train from bomb explosion in source code but in the reality world indeed there was a train bomb explosion at 7.30 am and how did it turned as failed attack in real world by end of the movie. Also how can colter gets into the body of Sean permanently and enter real world from source code, whiles his body is still in the Life support and his mind is still active.<br/><br/>Also at point we see colleen terminating the life support of Colter but at the end we see that his mind is still active and his body is still in life support.

Not to mention the fact that according to Hollywood all terrorists and modern evil-doers are white, blue-eyed folks is also getting a little repetitive (watching these movies one has the impression that Al Qaeda, for instance, consists of white, straight, Christian, patriotic, American men...).<br/><br/>I would rather wait until they show it on TV, going to a movie theater is a waste of time and money."
"Mark_and_two_Cats","5","2","5","1 October 2013"," Science-fiction. Fiction, yes - science, not so much...
","Here there be spoilers...<br/><br/>This movie, although well paced and well crafted, required much more than the suspension of disbelief one must employ with most movies; it also required suspension of physics, logic, and common sense.<br/><br/>Suspension of Logic. The dead soldier Colter Stevens had access to the dead train passenger's last eight minutes of existence. The passenger had no experience of the loo-bomb, the gun locker, the bomb-van, etc, therefore Colter could have had no experience of it, or of anything else outside the memories of the dead passenger. All he would have been able to do was replay the passenger's memories; anything else would necessarily be merely concocted. He would have no access to the dead girl other than the final eight minutes of the dead passenger's memories of her, so he would not be able to get her or anyone else on the train to respond to new interactions. He could only passively view the unalterable memories of the one dead passenger.<br/><br/>Suspension of Physics. The dead soldier and the dead train passengers shared a virtual existence, presumably within the computers of the Source Code project, yet it is claimed in the movie that a new world was created from the interactions of the ghosts of those dead folks within that machine. Matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transmuted from one to the other. Where did the unimaginable amount of energy come from that would be required to create a new world? Suspension of Common Sense. The body of the dead soldier is revealed lying within a chamber. His Source Code contact Goodwin told him that he had been with them for two months. He would have been a festering lump of rotten meat by that time without life-support for his brain and other tissues: a lung machine, fresh blood infusions, etc. All that was shown as being hooked up to him was the I/O between his brain and the Source Code computers.<br/><br/>Suspension of Common Sense. Colter was replaying the last eight minutes of the train's existence in the world's real time (the world of the Source Code project). How did a simulation of eight minutes of a train ride turn into a time machine? How did he, an avatar in a virtual world, go back in time in the real world to send a text message to Goodwin? Suspension of Physics & Logic. If Colter was in a newly created alternate reality, he must have had great phone coverage. How else could he have texted Goodwin in her reality? Remember: in Goodwin's real time, Colter would have texted her at the end of his final visit to the train. That did not take place before the beginning of the implementation of the Source Code run but at the end. So did the Goodwin that sent him on his unauthorised final trip cease to exist, or did her world continue on its way when Colter miraculously materialised a new existence out of nothing? I guess he was texting a newly created alternate Goodwin. That dead guy Colter has some mighty god skills! Suspension of Logic. Near the end of the movie, the crutch-guy tells Goodwin to wipe Colter's memory. What good would he be to them with no memory? All his military training gone. His experience with Source Code project gone. His identity gone.<br/><br/>Suspension of Common Sense. One passenger is hinted at being a moslem: full beard, shawl wrapped around his neck, yet the bomber turns out to be an American. Yeah, right. Possible but not likely. The film maker must have thought it necessary to display his political correctness, or maybe he was thumbing his nose at America. Either way, he can stick it up his bum.<br/><br/>Suspension of Cynicism. Why did the movie have to have such a cloyingly happy ending? Feh! I rate it at five: stupid but fun. I did end up caring about the pitiable soldier, plus there was a cute girl."
"wakemeup36","3","2","5","1 October 2011"," Stupidity galore
","Theoretically, this movie could have been great. No, not just great, amazing. The premise was quite promising, being that using Source Code, the protagonist could kind of infiltrate a recently dead person's memory and observe and interact with the environment the person was in. Interesting, no? The idea had some potential, but leave it to Hollywood to take a huge dump on anything with a potential.<br/><br/>The movie is ridden with so much instances of absurdities and nonsense, it almost becomes hilarious at certain points. Firstly, the romance between the two leads ie Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. Believe me when I say this, Jake falls in love with Michelle's character after spending about...oh, I don't know... 4 minutes with her! I mean, seriously, wow! They have absolutely 0 % chemistry and by God, any parts in which try to establish their relationship and immensely painful to watch. And then there's the thing with his dad. We're supposed to feel sorry for him or something because.... they didn't meet each other for a long time...? But we never see any interaction between Jake and his dad. Heck, we don't see his father at all. We don't know anything about him. Why should we care at all? <br/><br/>Oh whatever, the main plot involves Jake trying to find a bomber on the train. I just love how he tries to find out who did it. By randomly going up to people and threatening them. Classy, ain't it? Anyways, the person who turned out to be the bomber will probably be obvious to the audience less than half an hour into the film. And the whole concept of the 'twist' thing towards the end is so moronic it hurts real bad. Other than that, the special effects aren't good for this day and age, Russel Peters' role is absolutely pointless as he doesn't even get to tell one proper joke in the whole movie. What a waste. Of course at HQ, we also have the angry commanding officer, the sympathetic female and the bland white nerd all doing their respective generic jobs. Nothing you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is a very nonsensical film. Maybe just a tiny bit entertaining, but really doesn't matter when you realize that pretty much every other second in this film is inane and laughable."

I would compare this movie to Unstoppable, not only because it is on a train but because I could have told you the ending without ever seeing it.

","I first learned about Source Code thanks to IMDb. I saw Jake Gyllenhaal was starring in the film, so I decided to check out the trailer. It was brilliant. The trailer made me excited to see the actual movie and I was very disappointed (when I first saw the trailer) to find out that 'Source Code' wasn't out yet.<br/><br/>We were originally going to see 'Sucker Punch' today, but it wasn't showing during the times we were available. Luckily, I saw that this movie was also playing, so I eagerly suggested to watch this movie instead. It was a good choice, seeing as my mom, my sister and I all enjoyed this movie tremendously.<br/><br/>This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for Colter (Jake Gyllenhaal) to make his next move. I was surprised to see that this was sort of a low-budget movie. The director did a great job with limited funding. 'Source Code' will keep everyone interested. Unless you're that type of person who over-analyzes everything and wants everything to be perfect.<br/><br/>As an action movie, this film gets a perfect grade. As a thriller, another perfect grade. But I was confused with the science-fiction part of this movie. The ending made me confused. I didn't know what had happened anymore. I think that this movie should have ended 5 minutes earlier. But it didn't. And for that, I gave this movie a 9/10. A very small (and can be overlooked if you wish to) deduction.<br/><br/>'Source Code' is an excellent mystery thriller. Don't over think things.

","I can hear it now, the reviews from a not too distant future about Duncan Jones' (director of ""Moon"") latest film ""Source Code."" It will sound something like ""It's 'Quantum Leap' and 'Groundhog Day' combined."" That will be coming from both movie reviewers and the general moving going public. They will be right. For the most part. <br/><br/>""Source Code"" follows the same premise as the 1990s TV show ""Quantum Leap"" (in fact, keep your ears open for a cameo by a famous leaper) where the hero jumps into another's person's body via quantum physics. The theory of quantum physics is explained to the viewer in simple terms so that no one is confused. A military agency found a method to transport a test subject into the body of someone eight minutes before they die. The story allows a brief narrative on how it works; if it went any further it would have lost most of the audience. <br/><br/>The test subject is Capt. Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army who was recently on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. <br/><br/>Jones does a brilliant job of setting the audience up in the first scenes. We are there with Colter when he awakes in a commuter train bound for Chicago. He does not realize immediately that he is in a schoolteacher's body. He has the same reaction that most of us would in a new situation, immediately trying to figure what is happening. After eight minutes the train explodes and the Captain leaps back to his reality in a capsule at an undisclosed location. He is then presented a series of assimilation tests by Colleen Goodwin (played by Vera Farmiga) via a computer screen and video camera. She is with an unknown military agency but we, and Colter, are not sure which one. <br/><br/>The task for Colter is simple; he must keep leaping back into the schoolteacher's body on the train until he finds the bomber. During these leaps back to the train he is developing a relationship with a friend of the schoolteacher, Christina (played by Michelle Monaghan). <br/><br/>His missions continue to be eight minutes long and when he continues to fail he continues to blow up along with the train. The process then has to start all over. With each mission Colter is discovering more and more about the train, the bomb and all of its passengers. <br/><br/>Is this starting to sound like ""Groundhog Day?"" It is similar in some respects but don't expect any cameos by a famous furry subterranean rodent or any catchy Sonny and Cher songs. <br/><br/>The story continually pulls the viewer in not only because we want to know how Colter saves the day but also why Colter is in this situation in the first place. The story quickly becomes a ""who done it"" film with great ease because we care about the characters and their outcomes. <br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes. This film had a story that kept you engaged. It also presented a real fear of terrorism that most Americans could connect with. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is proving himself as a strong leading man. He can be tough, sensitive and comedic while performing the same scenes over and over again. <br/><br/>The entire cast including the strangers on the train seemed to gel together and lead the audience further the down rabbit hole without losing us. Plus, in the end we hear a nice message about why it is still good to be a human in a world that is so bitter and filled with fear."

","I had seen Moon and thought there was definitely something there. <br/><br/>As someone who grew up on sci-fi books and Twilight Zone, I was well-prepared for the story and ""twist"" that -- frankly -- was rather obvious and direct from the get-go. But, I love Sam Rockwell, thought he was the key to the film, and I was ready to see something from the same director. I was particularly interested to see what the kid would do with a bigger cast, more money and a larger platform.<br/><br/>Well, he did exactly what every other small, indie director does once he can ""break out"": he made a total flop of a film loosely based on ideas and stories we've seen a million times before. <br/><br/>Now, I didn't much care for Inception (and those who did might enjoy this film, because it's very similar, less for story -- which is comparable -- and more for tone: a heady, needlessly complicated film that puts style and pseudo-intellectual malarkey above plot and character development), and I did not see Deja Vu (which sounds very similar, especially the ""eight minutes"" part, if I recall from trailers). <br/><br/>Regardless, Source Code was no more ""original"" than any other large-scale movie that has come out in the last 20 years (if you think Sixth Sense -- which I actually thought was a decent film -- was ""original"" in its ""twist"" ending, then you really need to read more and/or, again, watch a few episodes of Twilight Zone). Frankly, no studio and no investor (indie or otherwise) can take a chance on a director's sophomore effort and -- essentially -- a first- time writer. Nolan got to do what he did with Inception because of the Batman franchise. Period. It's Show ""Business,"" not a non-profit museum board. These movies have to make money, not art. It's just the way it is nowadays, especially with more and more execs fearing for their jobs.<br/><br/>To be blunt, I fell asleep through most of this film. Granted, it was late and I was a little tipsy from a previous dinner, but the sleep saved me from having to watch endless repetitions of the same series of sequences running with -- again -- far too little actual plot and almost no real character development. <br/><br/>I'm not surprised at all that this film was the writer's first theatrically released project and that his previous endeavors are straight-to-DVD Species sequels. This film was exactly the kind of project that a fellow like that has mulling around in his head -- we've seen it before, has little to no real substance, understands little of traditional plot/character development, shoddy/wooden dialogue with ""hollow men"" type characters who are all completely 2-D (some rather ""intentionally""). <br/><br/>And, yes, regardless of what anyone might want to say about quantum physics or whatnot, it will be as clear as day to anyone else who understands both narrative screen writing theory and Hollywood politics that very obviously there was an ending (which was neither ""tragic"" nor ""happy,"" just a little more ""real"")... and then the studio brass probably got nervous and had one of their nephews slap on the saccharine ""Everything will be fine, folks, go home and tip your waiter on the way out"" tag that so many people are complaining about (even though I fell asleep, I awoke for the last 30 minutes or so, and both my friend and I were well aware that ""second"" ending did not belong).<br/><br/>I'm surprised that David Bowie's son would be involved in a mess like this (another reason I had seen the film), but -- as they say -- ""even Karl Marx had to pay for his beer.""<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has nothing to offer an educated audience nor one looking for something unique and even remotely interesting. Yes, I felt similar viz. Inception, but look what happened there. So, many I'm totally off-base. <br/><br/>Up to you!"

","I love films about time travel or films to that effect. It often brings about a creative way to explain a concept and the execution is quite entertaining to watch. Source code is a great example of this. We start off with limited information about how a person can travel in time. As the film unfolds we get more of a sense of what's going on. The person is not essentially alive but his consciousness lives on while a small remainder also exists of his body. <br/><br/>The scientist's task him with going back to the last 8 minutes of train explosion to find the bomb and the bomber. As the film goes on we see him know every 8 minutes and come close. What is interesting is what the scientist tells him and what he experiences are two different things. The beauty of the film in the end shows him emerge with a new life and identity having survived the train incident. Since time travel is novel the directors nicely show that even the scientists didn't know the potential of their own inventions.

There were several times in the movie where I went ""what? But that's not possible at all!"", to the point that I eventually had to try to disregard the manuscript flaws. But then again, I really enjoy movies where you have to be engaged all the time, and where the audience members gets to ""go the extra mile"".<br/><br/>One of the biggest reasons for the low vote is the neurological perspective, in where *SPOILER* the main character gets to partake in eight minutes of another persons mind. Even so, the main character has access to information that the other person did not have, which unfortunately is an enormous plot hole! *SPOILER*"
"willcundallreview","7","1","2","14 December 2015"," An interesting story that turns out fine
","Source Code is a Sci-fi thriller of a film and not a bad job is done here at all, it's very nifty but is paced well and the running time is not too long so it's a nice quick watch. Directed by Duncan Jones who of course made his name with the film ""Moon"" brings a nice movie and I feel he is the man to praise in terms of the nifty feel you get from this, it isn't overly complicated although the story cannot make sense at times, but the vast majority though is well worked and pretty entertaining. The movie is one that tries it's very hardest to draw you in, thrill you, then spit you out again, as evidenced by the fast paced moments that then suddenly stop and the movie goes into a lull of sorts but it's a nice feeling, I never thought I'd say I liked being spat out from one scene to another.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is the main man of the movie and does a pretty fine job of running the movie nearly all by his character though the cast is fairly small and doesn't try to create too many random people to revolve around Gyllenhaal, but that is one reason it feels more interesting. I feel it is very difficult to write about this movie without giving anything away, I can't really even talk about Gyllenhaal's character without revealing too much, but let's just say the character is well created and tackled well by Jake too. Other cast include Michelle Monaghan, Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga with an at time dedicated performance and makes some of the more slow moving scenes easy to watch and her character is another person who is key to the story.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones is backed up with a script from Ben Ripley who although creates something intricate and gives Jones a really good story to go on, I did feel sometimes the dialogue could be a little generic. Now Ripley does a good job here, far from bad but sometimes I did feel the talking some characters do is not always fantastic but I really can't take much at all away from Ripley, most of the time the dialogue is fine. And onto Jones again, this time I want to commend him on working well with the camera angles, he collaborates well with Don Burgess who is no fool when it comes to camera work in Sci- fi thriller or actions and sometimes the camera especially in the quicker scenes is handled very well.<br/><br/>If I had to recommend this movie well I think many can enjoy this, it's pretty thrilling and also a bit of fun too, seriously this movie tries to be funny even in very serious moments, it's good though. If you're coming into this having seen Duncan Jones's ""Moon"" then don't expect this to be as surreal and it is no doubt a Hollywood blockbuster-ish kind of movie, but really what this shows me is that it is people like Duncan Jones who should be given the chance directing these kind of films rather than a lot of others who create movies that seem like no thought has gone into them. Is it great? , no I don't think so although it is good and way more than OK, definitely one I would recommend. The ending is really what makes this movie a good movie but also gives this a solid finish that makes it not only look better, but also brings a much more raw and human final part which is not always seen in movies that look like this."

","""Source Code"" is an ingenious thriller that comes billed as science fiction, although its science is preposterous. Does that matter, as long as everyone treats it with the greatest urgency? The ""science"" in this case is used to prop up an appealing story of a man who tries to change the past.<br/><br/>His name is Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal). That he is sure of. That's why it's strange when he finds himself on a Chicago commuter train talking to Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), a woman he's never met. It's even stranger when he goes into the toilet and sees a face in the mirror that doesn't belong to him.<br/><br/>How can this be? We are far from sure in the early scenes, which embed us in his confusion. Because some of the pleasure comes from unwinding the mystery, I'd advise you to stop reading now; Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Colter gains consciousness to find himself (as himself) in a secret Army lab, talking to a scientist named Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). He gradually understands that the commuter train was destroyed by a terrorist bomb, and that the brain of one of the victims was harvested for memories of the last eight minutes before the explosion. <br/><br/>But listen. Goodwin and her Army intelligence team believe that by rerunning those eight minutes, they can discover the identity of the terrorist and prevent a larger explosion that could destroy Chicago. This is because the terrorist unwisely detonated the small bomb as a warning, or something, I dunno. In the movies, evildoers love to pass out alarms and clues so they can be prevented from carrying out their schemes.<br/><br/>Now comes the human touch. As he returns again and again to those fateful eight minutes, Colter finds that he can remember his previous visits, even though for Christina and others on the train, they are of course happening for the first time.Colter begins to care for Christina, as well he might; As the conscious occupant of this borrowed body, he apparently possesses free will and need not duplicate exactly what the original memory donor did.<br/><br/>What we have here, setting aside the fancy editing involving the time travel, is something that looks like hard science fiction. That's a threatened genre. Movies with plots are threatened in general; much modern ""science fiction"" involves blowing stuff up. The good classic sci-fi involved starting with an idea and exploring its implications.<br/><br/>Characters in Duncan Jones movies should learn not to be so sure of things. But Jones has the right spirit, Gyllenhaal and Monaghan are adept at playing their variations on the eight minutes, and here's a movie where you forgive the preposterous because it takes you to the perplexing."

","'Source Code' is a enjoyable sci-fi adventure about time travel. The film just has a few characters and two locations, but it has a good rhythm and the actors do a good work.<br/><br/>However, the film has some important flaws. First at all, it remembers to much to 'Groundhog Day' (1993) in some parts. When the main character tries to do everything perfect at the end, it's impossible not to thing in the Bill Murray's character.<br/><br/>Second, the happy end doesn't work. This film is a good thriller and a interesting sci-fi story, but the end is just a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Finally, all the story is about how the hero survives his own dead. But the main character is usurping some else body! He is 'killing' somebody and stealing his life to survive. And he falls in love with a girl who really doesn't know. Actually, she is not in love with him - is in love with the man whose body is possessed by the main character. She is tricked to love him! In conclusion, it's an entertaining film but with some important flaws."
"vipcorp-954-708527","7","1","2","23 March 2014"," How it should have ended - Still a great movie
","Late to the party with this, but I thought the movie was excellent. Far better than expected. The ending was poorly thought out, however, and it could have had the same kind of ""Hollywood"" finish and still made sense. This movie is old and I am not reviewing it - all has been said. Just want to share how I think it should have played out. SPOILERS...<br/><br/>After the freeze frame, Sean's consciousness returns to Sean's body and we now ""see"" him as Sean. Sean has no recollection of the past eight minutes and wonders how he came to be standing there kissing Christina. Because he looks a little lost, Christina looks at him puzzled, wondering if he didn't like the kiss and questions, ""What?"" Sean pauses and says, ""I don't know...I just have this feeling that...'everything will be okay.'"" He smiles. <br/><br/>Sean is taken aback and has some lasting impression, a feeling of goodness that has changed him in some way, but no knowledge of anything that happened while inhabited by Colter. Being lost in the moment with Christina, he doesn't immediately talk about this memory gap. He doesn't even know how much time he lost yet and he may never really know. For now, he will simply go have coffee with Christina and go to Millennium Park to look at ""The Bean"" with her. Maybe he will tell her about his lost time later and they'll have a quaint story of how their relationship began - who knows. All he knows right now is that he feels a change in himself and perhaps he appreciates life a little more. He was unknowingly ""touched"" by this brushing of minds.<br/><br/>In the final parallel reality described above, Goodwin gets the text sent by Colter during the eight minutes he was in Sean's body and she starts to figure things out - exactly as the movie portrayed it. In this final reality, the Colter in the box has never been sent into anyone's mind, so Goodwin will piece together that a Colter from an alternate reality (the narrative reality) sent the message while visiting the reality this Goodwin inhabits (the movie's final reality). No problem. Stands as written and makes sense.<br/><br/>Dr. Rutledge was wrong about how everything actually worked. If it really was only memories, then Colter couldn't have done anything Sean didn't do. What the Source Code really did was send a mind into a shared past (a la Back to the Future) where it could affect reality for eight minutes. Any changes made would simply effect the future of a new parallel universe, not the narrative universe who's future has already played out with the train bomb exploding.<br/><br/>This fits with what Rutledge said - no matter what Colter did, he could not change what happened in the original, narrative universe. Rutledge was right in that regard, but he failed to see that what Colter did each time he was sent into the Source Code would have real tangible effects in other possible future realities. <br/><br/>Rutledge believed that there was only one real universe - one timeline, and this doesn't make sense for the character. If he created the Source Code he should have at least understood something of the ""Many Worlds"" theory. Once he realized that Colter could take actions that revealed truths about Rutledge's ""real"" universe - Rutledge's current reality, the narrative reality - he should have realized that Colter could, in fact, change the outcome of possible alternate future realities. Why? <br/><br/>Because, while it is true from Rutledge's perspective that Colter can't save anyone on the train - can't change Rutledge's past - the very fact that Colter could do something like find the bomb tells him that ""a"" past is being changed or more correctly, a ""new"" past is being formed. Surely Rutledge wouldn't believe that Sean actually found the bomb with no impetus to do so and then stayed on the train to die - and Rutledge knows Sean did die in Rutledge's reality, likely without a clue of what was going on. He must then realize that Colter is creating a new past - just not the past of Rutledge's present reality. From the moment Colter enters Sean, a new past, one that is no longer Rutledge's, gets created. Rutledge should then surmise that if Colter can create new events in ""a"" past, that new past will have a real, viable future - an alternate reality.<br/><br/>Instead, Rutledge believes that Sean's mind ""afterglow"" contains things that Sean didn't even know (and thus, by extension, the state of the entire universe or at least everything knowable within eight minutes of Sean), and that Colter's mind can connect and manipulate that construct to reveal new information. Wouldn't it be more logical for Rutledge to believe in the Many Worlds theory than this idea? Although this Rutledge couldn't have known, Colter's text would end up proving the Many Worlds theory to the Rutledge in the final reality.<br/><br/>Continuing with my ending... Colter's mind returns to his body in the narrative reality and dies in that reality, as promised by Goodwin. This is the happiest ending possible for him. He created a future for Sean and Christina by stopping both bombs in their reality, he stopped the dirty bomb in his actual reality and he got his final contact with his father allowing him to go to his rest in peace.<br/><br/>Goodwin, in the narrative reality, gets court-martialled for sabotaging Source Code, but accepts her sentence knowing she did the right thing. Yes, Goodwin is truly a ""good one.""<br/><br/>Anyway...that is how I would have liked to see it happen. It allows the tidy, happy ending they were going for, without the plot holes.<br/><br/>And yes, it could have ended on the freeze frame too without tidying everything up. Still an enjoyable film and worthy of some stars."
"craig-hopton","6","1","2","7 March 2014"," It's OK
","I was looking forward to watching this after seeing another Jake Gyllenhaal movie but I have to admit I was disappointed. Gyllenhaal puts in a good performance as the hero of this Sci-Fi mystery but the film itself didn't live up to expectations.<br/><br/>The premise of the plot is perfectly good - a man is sent back in time to the scene of a train-crash to work out whodunnit. The problem is a) you never feel like Gyllenhaal's character is put in any real danger (this is not an edge-of-the-seat number) and b) the mystery proves remarkably easy to resolve when he actually puts his mind to it. There is so much more they could have done with the plot to make things more interesting.<br/><br/>The movie is partially redeemed by a sub-plot in which Gyllenhaal tries to uncover the truth behind the motives of the people he is working for - this adds a bit of interest. But the fact is that without Gyllenhaal's performance, Source Code would be seriously mediocre. As it is, it's OK."

","Colter Stevens is an army captain who wakes up suddenly on a Chicago-bound train, unaware of how got there. When a bomb explodes eight minutes later he reawakens in a capsule. It transpires he is an operative in a daring experiment to analyse the brainwaves of one of the train victims in an attempt to unmask the bomber's identity ...<br/><br/>This low-key but exciting thriller is fun, fast, full of interesting ideas and well acted by all four leads. It ploughs straight into the action with no dull establishing shots and keeps on blasting our hero into and out of danger, but thanks to excellent editing by Paul Hirsch it doesn't feel jumpy or disjointed. As we become familiar with the setup and the train's occupants we want Colter to succeed, figure out what's going on and find a way out of the conundrum. The movie gradually and carefully reveals important details until we are truly engrossed in both the killer's identity and Colter's hopeless situation. Gyllenhaal plays is straight down the middle, an ideal sweaty Everyman hero, and the contrast between this and Wright's shifty, diffident, everything-for-the-program chief scientist is excellent. As with many good movies, by keeping the characters, locations and duration to a minimum, all of the intrigue, drama and suspense is ramped up to the max. I do have one problem though and that's the ending, which I must confess I don't understand; the Source Code concept as an interactive playback of a cerebral afterimage is fine. But, as Wright maintains, it's not a time machine, so when the action not only goes beyond the eight-minute limit but also suggests communication between multiple alternate realities it kind of goes off into a fairy tale for me. A lot of fun nevertheless though; a big screen Twilight Zone story for the twenty-first century. Nicely directed by Jones (Moon) and sharply written by Ben Ripley, this is a solid movie and the second best temporal paradox thriller drama with Gyllenhaal in the lead."
"zaphodb1","7","1","2","26 October 2012"," The Improbable versus the Impossible
","Well acted, well directed, good character development. Although repeating the train journey several times, it was not repetitive, as each time, the movie explored more of the mystery/puzzle surrounding the circumstances of the main character and the reason for the train journey.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the idea of being able to reconstruct from the memories of the deceased, the last 8 minutes of what they experienced - and injecting this into someone else's brain, so that they experience an 'interactive' environment. While improbable, when this sort of thing turns up in a movie, its called science fiction.<br/><br/>The only problem is the ending. Ihe main character is terminated at the end of a train journey sequence, and he then goes on living in an alternative time line. While this is a nice ending, it is not explained, even within the bounds of science fiction, leaving a dissatisfied taste at the end. 7/10"
"Cineman17","7","1","2","16 January 2012"," Melodramatic and cliché, but overall very intriguing.
","The dialog is a bit too cheesy at most parts. It is cringe-worthy, very poor screen writing, but overall the story is fascinating, unpredictable and original. Like with Moon, director Duncan Jones brings up very interesting food for thought. There are some REAL heavy ethical points here, but the film never dives into any depth with them. I felt there was so much more to explore with source code, and it would have been very rewarding if the the film was about 30- 40 minutes longer and ventured into some of the issues that the film only scratched the surface of. I felt the film barely had time to handle the fast-paced surface aspect of the story. The acting and action of the film was spot-on, though I wish the film would have had a different ending. Overall, Source Code is a great film, but had the potential to be something absolutely amazing like Moon was."

If anyone has watched star trek or most any other television sci-fi, you will guess this plot in the first 5 minutes as I did. You probably won't be able to predict the ending as there is a decent twist. However, the ending twist I'd say kind of ruins the ""moving"" aspect of the movie as well and just makes it even more kind of bland. But, now that I say that if the movie had ended in another way I probably would have thought it just even more typical and over done.<br/><br/>It's enjoyable, but only if you have something better to see or haven't watched a lot of sci fi before and don't get the plot in the first 5 minutes."
"xkhushali","8","1","2","19 November 2011"," Worth seeing.
","Right from the start, the intense music and mind racing scene catches your attention...and also leaves you squirming with questions (e.g. ""What just happened?!""). This movie is about a guy named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is on a mission to find the bomber of a train that exploded killing everyone on board. The twist? Well, it's complicated. Stevens has to constantly ""go back"" in eight minute intervals to the event to find out who the mysterious bomber is. He ""goes back"" through a program called Source Code which is a program that lets a selected being so-to-speak ""relive"" an event but not change the outcome or anything of the sort because Source Code acts similar to a parallel world. The movie follows Stevens' journey through the use of this innovative program that could perhaps save a future, bigger scale, bombing from happening. The only con I have in the storyline is the end. I felt it was too ""Hollywood"". It felt as if it went on a little longer than it should have.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, Jake Gyllenhaal is not to be underestimated; he has come a long way from ""Donnie Darko"". Vera Farmiga (who played Goodwin, the lady running Source Code), was a star like always. Jeffrey Wright, who played the mastermind behind Sorce Code had a nice performance as a particularly mysterious guy. Michelle Monaghan was the love-interest of the movie, her parts were simple yet sweet. Russell Peters even had a small part in the movie. In my opinion, his acting was decent, but I would have liked to see him play himself (though his character is similar). Overall, in three words, this movie was: innovative (the concept was something fresh that I hadn't seen in a movie recently), suspenseful (you'll be guessing throughout the movie who the bomber is), and (incredibly) mind-blowing. This is one of the best new movies out this year and defiantly one of the best thrillers out recently."

I mean, if we copy exact the same world from yesterday, what are the odds that it grows into what we have today? Let alone pointing out the murder.<br/><br/>Put aside these logical faults, let's take a look at the end of the story. If it ended right at when they kissed and and the whole world froze, then I would think this movie as some fairy tale and forgive it for trying to insult my intelligence.

"brando647","8","1","2","5 September 2011"," An Exciting Thriller with Bits of Science Fiction
","We need more filmmakers like Duncan Jones with a passion for great science fiction. His first film, MOON in 2009, was one of the best in years and his second while his second, SOURCE CODE, isn't as thought-provoking, it's still better than the majority of recent science fiction. SOURCE CODE feels a bit more mainstream than MOON, but it still focuses on an interesting story without relying on action to keep the viewer engaged. Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a helicopter pilot for the US military who unknowingly becomes a part of an experimental program called Source Code. He awakens on a Chicago commuter train with no memory of how he arrived, and he soon discovers that he's inhabiting the body and mind of a school teacher. Eight minutes later, the train explodes and Stevens is informed of his mission. The train had exploded in Chicago earlier that morning as a warning of future attacks to come and Stevens has been given the chance to relive the final eight minutes leading up to the attack and discover the identity of the bomber before he can strike again. Still, his commanding officers are being sketchy with the details of the project and Stevens begins to suspect there's something they're not telling him...<br/><br/>Modern science fiction in the mainstream is pretty much limited to comic book movies and big-budget blockbuster fare (e.g. Abrams' STAR TREK reboot or Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS series). Every so often, a shining gem emerges that reminds us that science fiction was once a great genre used as a means of getting the audience contemplating mankind's flaws and where they might lead us. In recent years, DISTRICT 9 reminded us of the horrors of apartheid and applied them to our first contact with an alien species. Jones' own MOON contemplated how human rights might (or might not) apply to clones. SOURCE CODE doesn't focus as much on big questions, though it does pose the moral question as to whether it was all right to force one man's constant suffering/repeated death if it means saving millions more. The movie does touch on Stevens' predicament and whether the program is justifiable but it focuses more on the mystery element as Stevens is given multiple chances to try and identify the train bomber. You would think watching him relive the same eight minutes over and over again would become dull, but Jones and writer Ben Ripley keep it fresh each time with new information and new strategies.<br/><br/>Jones is displaying a knack for great casting. Gyllenhaal does an excellent job here as Stevens. He's confused, frightened, and dropped into the middle of a situation where he has no control. He skillfully relates with the audience, and it was the little things that hit me as his best moments. I loved his reaction to the news of his fate from the last mission he remember in Afghanistan. Little bits like that and his dedication to saving a woman he's been repeatedly reminded already died. Michelle Monaghan is adorable as Stevens' only ""friend"" on the train and growing love interest, and Vera Farmiga was a great choice as his military point-of-contact Goodwin. Honestly, I envy Stevens in a sense. Who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their lives with Farmiga's beautiful face staring down. Jeffrey Wright is the project's creator and an antagonist in his own way, valuing his project over Stevens life and rights.<br/><br/>It doesn't feel as rich in content as MOON, but SOURCE CODE is still a strong second film for director Duncan Jones. It's enough to place him among the new era of emerging directors that I'm excited to see what they do next."

"pc95","6","1","2","31 August 2011"," Unfocused but Good Concept
","Anyone who's a Star Trek fan will immediately recognize that the creators of ""Source Code"" have wholly taken freely from their content - in this case, if you're interested, watch Star Trek The Next Generation's episode entitled ""Cause and Effect"". That episode is better polished than this movie and minute for minute a better production despite being 17 or so years done before it, (spoiler) but the movie does a good job with the idea of replaying time over again and again. You cant blame the creators for employing a good idea. The problem is, the human aspect of the story gets overcooked and overdone in Source Code, and Jake Gyllanthal although did a satisfactory job, probably the lead role could have been afforded to a better actor. I liked Source Code, especially it's explanations and details of what's happening during the first two-thirds of it's length. The love interest though doesn't quite mesh, and unfortunately the ending is painted too rosy and gets sappy. Still if you like science-fiction and it's employment of time as a theme, and you liked ""Source Code"" check out the Star Trek episode mentioned above if you've never seen it, enjoy and marvel at the parallels."

The only thing Rutledge will tell him, is that he must play out the last eight minutes of the Tran's existence over and over again.<br/><br/>To top it off, while Colter is on the Train, he is not Colter, but ""Sean Fentress"" - Whose body he inhabits each time he visits the train. It is during these 8-Minutes on the Train, Colter meets and comes to know Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), who sees Colter as Fentress! Confused yet? As with Inception, I had to watch this a second time, and still have not gotten all that is happening, in this very creative tale written by Fledgling screenwriter Ben Ripley and directed by Duncan Jones, who is the son of Alt/Glam-Rocker David Bowie.<br/><br/>This story holds together quite well, despite some continuity problems due to the non-linear nature of the storyline. Some have equated this film to Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"" - But as Terry Gilliam's films are always very dark and hopeless, this film has very bright spots in it, and the ending is a hopeful ending, despite the curious nature of Colter's state of being.<br/><br/>Colter, told by Rutledge he is living in a Simulation, finds that he can affect outcome in the ""real world"" (He tells Rutledge he will buy him a Pizza) - If Colter's experiences on The Train are simply a ""replay"" of the last 8 minutes of the Train, as Rutledge insists, and exist only as Source Code in a Computer, then Colter would not be able to change the events which happen on the train, which ultimately effect changes in Rutledge's and Goodwin's reality - And of course ""This is not supposed to happen"". Rutledge dismisses Colter's claims out of hand, but Goodwin, who is also a soldier, starts responding to direct questions by Colter as to his state and location, and ultimately she believes that he can effect the changes he claims he can accomplish, this belief leads to her giving Colter his last opportunity.<br/><br/>There are a couple of things that bother me about this, they never explain how Sean Fentress's body is able to be inhabited. Rutledge explains it away as Fentress and Colter have similar body and mind characteristics, now this is fine when it comes to explaining Colter, but Fentress... His actual Brain would have to be within proximity of Colter. This is simply, mentioned once, and never explained or mentioned ever again in the film. - How is it that Colter ""becomes"" Fentress? Perhaps there were 25 minutes of film left on the editing room floor that could explain this, and if that is the case, we'll eventually have to see a version of this film that has the footage restored- The people who edit films never realise, that if you make something believable, people WILL sit in a Theatre for two and a half hours. I think it is the policy of the movie companies, to release as SHORT a Theatrical Release as possible, with the sheer volume of ""Directors"" or ""Alternate Cuts"" of just about every film available recently, you can be sure this is the general policy! More showings per day, more buttocks in Seats!"

"panzicong","Null","1","2","5 August 2011"," If Your Life Has Only 8 Minutes Left
","""Everything is gonna be OK"". These words stay in my mind after I saw the movie Source Code. They are said by Colter Stevens, the main actor in the movie, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Through Source Code, the director not only presents a science-fictional world created by his outstanding talent, but also questions us what life is to us by a complex but ingenious story including issues such as love, morality and regret.<br/><br/>The plot, by Ben Ripley who was the writer of two unsuccessful movies, Species 3 and 4, has finally won lots of audiences. It's about a soldier, Colter Stevens, who, on finding himself with a different face and identity on a strange train, is blown up after 8 minutes. After the explosion, he wakes up in a sealed container, can only talk with his commander thorough a monitor, and finds what he has experienced on the train is generated by a computer program, named Source Code, from the 8-minute remaining memory from the deaths of that train. His mission is to find out who set the bomb and to prevent a large explosion in the near future. Then, he is sent back into the same program again and again. During this process, he finds the container where he is trapped is also generated by source code. What is the conspiracy? Also, his short but genuine love to the girl who sits opposite to him and his regret to his father make him suffered. What would he do in these 8 minutes? Though style has been compromised to the ticket box office, this movie has inherited the ""geek attribute"" of The Moon, one of the best independent scientific fiction movies in 2009. Directed by Duncan Jones who also directed The Moon, Source Code is his first try on commercial movie. However, it has earned a gross of $54,696,902 only in USA and has an overall score 7.3 of 10 in IMDb. As a sci-fi movie, it has compact paces, imaginative plot and elaborated editing. The unexpected ending leaves the audience an interesting problem to explore and provokes a heated discussion on the internet. It is clear that Source Code maintains a high standard of a sci-fi movie should have, while winning a good popular appreciation.<br/><br/>Besides the scientific fiction side of Source Code, which can be regarded as the rational part of this movie, the emotional part also outweighs other sci-fi movies. The movie sets several 8-minute countdowns for not only Colter in the story, but also audience in front of the screen, to think about what is the most correct way to solve the problem. When getting closer to the truth, you will also question yourself. What is the most important thing in my life when I have only 8 minutes left? What if I have another 8 minutes? Can I live it more meaningfully? What has to be mentioned again is the ending; it does not fall at a cliché with a sadly beautiful ending; it gives you inspiration and faith to change your life and your beloved.<br/><br/>In the end, I have to say, Source Code has a perfect combination of science fiction and romantic love. The ending of the story worth is 86 minutes wait. If you cannot wait, what I can tell you right now, in his last 8 minutes, the main actor chooses to save the world, say sorry to who he hurt, kiss who he loves, and tells her everything's gonna be OK. Just imagine you have 8 minutes left in your life, what would you do?"

","It's not a high sci-fi, it's not a thriller, more of a drama, actually. <br/><br/>Like most people, I liked Jake Gyllenhaal from Donnie Darko and I've been following his career (as well as his talented sister's) since. Well, it's definitely way better than Prince of Persia blockbuster, I'd tell you.<br/><br/>The thing is, that despite quite predictable twists and turns of the plot and some pieces of bad acting (Michelle Monaghan was plain dull), there's a good camera work with carefully selected angles and lighting, JG and, of course, Vera Farmiga do their best and create great characters, music is OK and... all in all, it just leaves the right aftertaste.<br/><br/>Good flick, most probably because it is not grim. It was easy to go either to heroic stupidity of most Tom Cruise' movies or dark thriller like Pandorum.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","2","4 August 2011"," A brainy thriller, one that you'll remember . . .
","""Source Code"" is a wonderfully odd and intriguing science fiction thriller. It is one of those movies that begins with no information and then builds a rotating mystery piece by piece. It contains a lot of twists and turns, a lot of detail and we are with it every step of the way.The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens, an Army Helicopter Pilot who has done his time in Iraq. As the movie opens, he is on a crowded commuter train headed into Chicago, sitting across from a woman he doesn't know. Her name is Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), she apparently knows him very well and keeps calling him Sean. Investigating his surroundings, he looks in a mirror and sees a different man staring back at him. What is going on here? Who is the man in the mirror? That's only the beginning of a long series of questions an unraveling mystery.<br/><br/>Here, I should tell you, I am going to have to give away some spoilers,so if you want to go into the movie cold, stop reading now.<br/><br/>The train that Stevens is riding on is rigged with bomb that will explode in 8 minutes. The bomb does explode and Stevens wakes up inside a capsule at a government laboratory, in his own body, speaking to an Air Force Captain named Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) on a tiny screen. It seems that he is part of an experiment, and his mission is to go back onto the train - in the mind and body of this man Sean - and discover the source of the bomb. The time between his arrival and the detonation is only 8 minutes each time and each time he must start over from the same point in time. He is the only passenger on the train who is aware of this.<br/><br/>The bomb keeps exploding at the end of eight minutes so over and over, Colter's mind is sent back onto the doomed train to find the source. Sometimes he finds a new piece of information, sometimes he uncovers a lead that turns to nothing. What is amazing about the movie is that it keeps up the intrigue of Stevens' mission and opens up to reveal more and more about the mystery of both the train and the experiment. This is a very clever movie that is entertaining even when you're not 100% sure you understand what is going on. What is fun is seeing Gyllenhaal going back over and over again to that train with new information (even though for the rest of the people on the train it is still the same timeline) and trying piece by piece to stop the train from exploding.<br/><br/>There is a lot of technical talk in ""Source Code"", a lot of conversation about the experiment that is being conducted. I'm not sure I could pass a test on it. It sounded somewhat logical and I'm sure on a second viewing I will understand it even more. What works is that this clockwork plot is never dull or predictable or confusing. It is a smart movie, cleverly written.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Duncan Jones, who made the overlooked ""Moon"" three years ago with Sam Rockwell as a lonely man on a lunar base who discovers some disturbing facts about his mission. Jones makes science fiction thrillers that are brainy, not padded with gunshots and noise. His scripts are well thought out, even if a little preposterous. I'm not sure he has perfected writing his endings though. In the case of both Moon and Source Code, they both seem to end on a note that's a little less ironic then we might be comfortable with. Still, this is a very good science fiction thriller."
"shannon_ranaweera","Null","1","2","4 August 2011"," An intelligent story with suspense and twists
","This has an interesting plot which is both quite intelligent and captivating. Special credit should go to Gyllenhaal who displays his great acting skills which is highly commendable. Especially the difference he manages to depict from the first flashback to the train in the opening scene against the later flashbacks. Where the situation is similar but he is more and more intelligent and aware of the purpose. Monaghan's role can be said as somewhat the opposite of Gyllenhaal's where she becomes more and more confused in each flashback on how this guy in front of her can ""read out her mind"".<br/><br/>The storyline is not too confusing though someone might say that they got too tired of watching the same train scenario playing over and over again. but that too made the audience think ""who is the bomber?"" and sometimes made you scream out ""no that's not the guy! try the one next to him"".<br/><br/>The ending might crop us some controversial thoughts as to how a person whose brain was living could request for mercy killing OR that its inhuman to get military services from a soldier's last living organ even after sacrificing his life for the nation.

","I have mixed feelings about source code.

As said earlier, Gyllenhaal excels at playing the disoriented captain, and reminded me of an older version of his Donnie Darko.<br/><br/>Source Code is thus a good but not exceptional movie, that is definitely worth watching."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","2","27 June 2011"," Source Code is Fresh
","¨What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?¨ Source Code is a great action thriller directed by David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, who is beginning to make a big name for himself in Hollywood. In 2009 Jones directed a small film starring Sam Rockwell called Moon, and it was among my top films of that year. It was a great science fiction thriller that reminded me a lot of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. Jones does very interesting work once again with Source Code; although this time he didn't come up with the screenplay. This was a much bigger project and Jones probably had to deal with producers this time around. There are some great and inventive moments, but there are others (like in the ending) that remind us that this is another Hollywood popcorn movie. The movie works in most part thanks to a great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Source Code ranks among one of his better performances at least in an action film. Due to the premise the story could have become predictable, repetitive, and boring, but thankfully it doesn't because of the twists (at times it goes entirely a different direction than what we expected) and because Gyllenhaal gives it the freshness it needs. Monaghan didn't seem to be up to par with Jake, but it doesn't matter because she was just a supporting character. Some credit has to be given to Ben Ripley, who although being relatively unknown in Hollywood came up with a fresh, innovative, and interesting script. The action thriller worked really well and I hope Hollywood keeps introducing some new and fresh ideas like they did with Source Code.<br/><br/>Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a soldier who from one moment to the next goes from being in a helicopter in Afghanistan to finding himself on a train in Chicago with the identity of another person. Stevens doesn't understand what is going on as the girl sitting in front of him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan), is talking to him. Colter doesn't recognize anyone in the train and when he sees himself in the mirror he realizes he is in someone else's body. Suddenly in the mix of all this confusion a bomb goes off and everyone in the train explodes. Colter wakes up inside a pod without understanding what is going on. There is a lady on a screen talking to him and informing him of his situation. Her name is Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and she tells him he is part of a program called the Source Code. A train has exploded in Chicago and they are sending him back in time to try to figure out who the bomber is before another explosion takes place. Colter is being sent into a sort of parallel universe in an attempt to discover who the bomber is, not to prevent it from occurring because it already has happened. The program seems to be able to create a worm hole that is plugged to a human consciousness. The data it receives comes from the dead people on the train. Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) is working with Goodwin; he is the scientist behind this program and he explains to Colter what is going on. They obtain this data because the human mind retains the last eight minutes of their lives, therefore they are able to connect Colter into their consciousness and send him into this parallel universe in order to identify the bomber. He only has eight minutes to make the discovery and if he doesn't the train explodes and he has to be sent each time.<br/><br/>Scott Bakula's voice can be heard when Colter calls his father from the train. Bakula is known for the TV series, Quantum Leap, which has a premise similar to the one in this movie. Jones probably added his cameo in order to credit the series for the similarity. This action thriller begins with a bang. We are put right in the middle of the action and there is no need for us to be told what is going on. Jones leaves us out from the introduction and allows us to be just as confused as Gyllenhaal's character is. We are just as lost as he is and we begin to make discoveries along the way at the same time he does. This is what makes Source Code really work: it hooks our attention from the beginning and makes us pay close attention to the action. Jones respects his viewers and doesn't dumb down the plot, he makes us think and get immersed in the plot. Source Code is really short (93 minutes long) and it moves at a very fast pace. If Jones would have slowed down and tried to explain what was going on then the movie wouldn't have the impact it did, but by letting us figure out what was happening as the plot unraveled we became more and more engrossed by the action. Source Code is one of those movies that grab us by surprise, one that we didn't expect much from, but end up leaving with a smile on our face because it comes as a sort of fresh air after a hot day. Hollywood doesn't make much of these movies anymore, but when they do come out its exciting to see something different. Too bad they ended up giving Source Code a typical Hollywood ending, but beside that I have no complaints. This was a great action thriller.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

If you are a true American soldier, you will serve your country after you die... If you block this part out of your mind, you may enjoy this film.

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","1","2","23 May 2011"," A thriller that values its heart and its mind more than velocity or adrenaline
","A man (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a train not knowing where he is. The girl in front of him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and she thinks she knows him, even when he insists that he is actually an army pilot named Colter. Going into the bathroom he checks his appearance and sees that he has someone else's face. When the train explodes Colter awakens inside a freezing cold container. He's addressed on a computer screen by Colleen (Vera Farmiga), a military captain who explains that he is part of a program called Source Code. It's administered by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and allows a person to inject themselves into someone else's body to relive the last eight minutes of their life. It is said not to affect the past but to address the future. As such, Colter's mission is to go back in time and find out who has placed a bomb on the train so that the bomber can be identified and stopped from setting off a second explosive in the city. <br/><br/>Source Code is a thriller that values its heart and its mind more than velocity or adrenaline. If Inception and Monsters gave hope last year for the intelligent blockbuster then this is the cherry on top. Working in the action genre, it's a more accessible film than Duncan Jones' leisurely paced sci-fi debut Moon. But with a solid screenplay from Ben Ripley the depth and the intelligence have not been forgotten. This is a highly economical film, working in just a few locations and moving vigorously over its lean ninety minutes. Despite its brevity, the script has more interesting ideas than so many inflated blockbusters. Jones is concerned foremost about the misuse of technology but equally the paranoia that terrorism imposes on ordinary people: an intelligent and timely theme, which surprisingly gives way to brief moments of humour. The human responses from the passengers as Colter interrogates them, turning their bags inside out, are quietly funny. Even more fascinating is the way the film touches on how racial assumptions are born from paranoia, like when Colter stalks a man of Indian appearance and also the way soldiers are brainwashed to fight mentally off the battlefield. These are issues visualised with intensity and originality. <br/><br/>As a science fiction piece the film is more of a jigsaw, with a few pieces missing. It's refreshing that the film throws viewers into the deep end, without lengthy expositional dialogue. For that reason it compels for much of its length, only to be marred by an ambiguous ending. It's a finale open to interpretation but not in the same satisfying manner as Inception's ending. This does little to detract from three impressive performances. Gyllenhaal is in fine touch, continually expressing his fear and his disorientation. The audience feels his claustrophobia most effectively through some tight close-up shots inside the container. He also holds the film's most touching moments, like Colter's fractured relationship with his dad, giving Source Code poignant thoughts about the last moments of our lives. And refreshingly for this genre, the women are dominant too. Monaghan is charismatic and has the most difficult role of balancing her normality and her skepticism. She succeeds accordingly. Farmiga is the most internal of the three but she's visibly conflicted about Colter's treatment because she's a solider too. Their relationship makes sense. Source Code has already been a huge box office success. I hope Hollywood will recognise this and continue to make more thrillers of similar merits."

"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","16 April 2011"," Duncan Jones with a 2nd Home-Run!
","Two years ago a small independent sci-fi film called Moon was released. It was one of the three best films of that year. So I knew Duncan Jones was a director to look out for. A few months ago when I heard about the plot for Source Code I thought it would be an experiment gone wrong. The trailer reinforced those ideas even more, to the point that I never bothered to anticipate it or even know when it was about to come out. Then it was released to some strong reviews. The film deserved them, because this is Duncan Jones at another strong outing.<br/><br/>Source Code handles some sci-fi ideas with it's plot in a very well thought-out manner. The screenplay is pretty great, especially when we have seen films 'play out dejavus' before. But Source Coce represents a new idea. It is true that the actual mechanics of the film's 'Source Code' would probably not be able to work in the real world, but this film succeeds in the same way that Moon succeeded. It deals with some very interesting ideas that are center in the plot of one male lead. Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty great in the main role. He hasn't had a performance or film this good since... well, a LONG time. Michelle Monaghan is also pretty good, and it's very easy to know why this character would be going out with a woman who's this likable. I also loved the ending.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones is 2 for 2 with this and Moon. Both are great thought-out films, although they do have different looks, since Moon was low-budget and this one definitely does feel a lot more mainstream. Jones kind of reminds me of how Christopher Nolan started out, with indies like Memento on to big films like The Dark Knight and Inception. Hopefully Jones becomes just as big (although better luck to Jones than Nolan at the Oscars, hehe)."

","Source Code is a more convoluted, faster paced Ground Hogs Day [1993] with guns and a ticking time bomb. Although not that well made Source Code is a reminder that audiences prefer complex story lines, even if they aren't completely coherent.<br/><br/>Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot who is trapped in some sort of machine simulator. The beginning of the film starts with Stevens waking up on a train in a body that is not his own. He's sitting across from Christina Warren played by Michelle Monaghan, a female companion who he will learn later on has a small crush on him, or at least who she thinks Sean Fentress. Stevens lives 8 minutes of Fentress's life trying to gather himself when a bomb suddenly explodes killing everyone on the train. <br/><br/>Stevens awakens in a metal dome disoriented and locked into a harness. Without knowing who or where he is an image and voice appear when he is contacted by Luit Goodwin played by Vera Farmiga. Goodwin tells Stevens that he must identify the bomber of the train so that they can prevent another terrorist attack. Steven's doesn't quite understand what's going on with his last memories being aboard a helicopter in Afghanistan. Before too many of Stevens' questions are answered he is to told to try again and abruptly plugged back into the source code. <br/><br/>This process continues over and over until bit by bit is revealed what the source code is. Apparently source code allows a certain someone to be plugged into the consciousness of another certain someone and live out an alternate reality, something involving string theory and such. The rules are that he only he can only live out the last 8 minutes of that someone's life because that's how long the ""flash"" lasts when someone dies. Also, whatever he does in that reality will not affect any other reality. <br/><br/>So Gyllenhaal is plugged into the source code relentlessly by his military commanders over and over until he finds the bomber. Over the course of his multiple reenactments Stevens narrows down the bomber and develops a relationship with Ms. Warren and Luit. Goodwin. <br/><br/>Gyllenhall and Monaghan are good but nothing spectacular. Jeffrey Wright plays the nerdy mastermind quite well. He's cruel, discordant and tunnel minded; just what you'd expect from a scientist who's spent his whole life dedicated to his pet project. But it is Vera Farmiga who really shines in her role as the intermediate officer between the enslaved Steven's and the heartless scientist. In every scene Framiga battles with the two conflicting personas of her character. The female empathic side trying to soothe and care for Stevens as he's used as a cog in the high tech military defense machine; and also the military stratagician (stratagician is not a word???) who must convince Stevens to finish the mission while withholding the painful truth of Stevens' condition. <br/><br/>The music in Source Code is a little pretentious and is abnormally noticeable. Its special effects are not the greatest with explosions and slow motion looking like they had been done by a sub par video game company. However it's not just the special effects, nor its mediocre cinematography but also Source Code's erratic pacing and editing for my undistinguished rating. The scenes don't flow well together and you feel just as pushed around as Gyllenhaal's character as you bolt back and forth between scenes. This feeling may have been deliberate on director Duncan Jone's part but watching the movie you feel like you've been riding the old bumpy wooden roller coaster you'd find at the boardwalk. <br/><br/>At the end of the film you're constantly teased with false endings. As soon as you think it's going to end, they tag on and extra scene which tangles the plot even further. During the last 20 minutes they start abandoning the rules of source code and begin cramming in new content. It's like they shot multiple endings of the film and instead of choosing one, they decided to put them all in. <br/><br/>Source Code is an intriguing film with a lot of complexities and philosophical metaphysics involved which I think is the reason for its success at the box office and among critics. As we know from Inception and The Matrix audiences today are really drawn to these alternate reality movies. However Source Code is not particularly well constructed and i'll be re- watching Ground Hog's Day numerous times before I even think about re-watching Source Code."
"dvc5159","7","1","2","8 April 2011"," A very intriguing sci-fi concept..
","""Source Code"" opens with a man who awakens in a train in front of a woman who apparently is his girlfriend. he then stumbles upon a mirror and finds that his reflection is different. While arguing with the passengers the train is blown up, killing everyone on board.<br/><br/>The man wakes up in a metallic chamber of sorts. A screen lights up and shows a female officer debriefing him about his situation. It turns out that he is a soldier used in a revolutionary device known as the ""Source Code"" which ""sends him back"" to the time and place before the bombings. No - they do not want him to save the day, the events have already happened and they are using him to find out who did it and to stop them since they had planned it to be a series of attacks on the city.<br/><br/>If the plot is anything to go by, ""Source Code"" is an extremely entertaining thriller with the right amount of action, suspense, mystery and romance. It is also - a rarity for movies today - a blockbuster which also makes you think. Not at the same level of ""Inception"", mind you - this is a totally different ball game. While not nearly as deep as ""Inception"" or ""Blade Runner"" the science fiction concept got me thinking for a while. This isn't a sci-fi classic, but it's close.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Jake Gyllenhaal makes for a solid action lead with him balancing the emotions at the right time; Vera Farmiga is somewhat cold in the beginning as the officer in charge of Gyllenhaal's situation and Michelle Monaghan plays the clichéd love interest, but both do fairly well in their roles; but Jeffrey Wright is superb as the somewhat quirky/creepy scientist.<br/><br/>As for the plot, some call it an amalgamation of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Deja Vu"" with a heavy twist of ""The Matrix"". Call it as you like, but I found it intriguing - even bordering on ""hard"" sci-fi, where done wrong it would be a disaster, however it is done right here; Wright's scientist character explains it all in a short but straightforward way that you will find it easy to understand and yet think whether this is possible or not. Preposterous? Maybe. Ingenious? Definitely.<br/><br/>Production wise - the production design and art direction are good for what they can offer. The special effects - dodgy at times, fluid during others. The editing - good but somewhat hokey during the ""time travel"" parts. Camera work - superb. You get to see everything that happens without a cameraman inflicted with Parkinsons'. The music is great by Chris Bacon - a fresh composer I've never heard of - whose music style reminisces of the glory days of the '80s/'90s orchestral action film scores by Jerry Goldsmith.<br/><br/>This is director Duncan Jones' second feature film after the brilliant ""Moon"" two years ago, and Ben Ripley's first mainstream screenplay after the back-to-back direct-to-video Species sequels. Jones and Ripley work wonders with the script, adding a huge sense of unpredictability and intelligence in an already smart script. Just when you think you've got it, there's a surprise after another. Jones keeps the film tight and taut, with the film's length of 90 minutes never holding back.<br/><br/>My only gripe is with the ending, the film could've been a classic had it not been for a (somewhat) Hollywood ending, or if it had the final three minutes cut off, right after the still frame. It may get you thinking about whether it is real or not, though.<br/><br/>In short, this is a very good, though not great, blockbuster, with some really neat thrills and ingenious twists, an intriguing sci-fi concept and some good performances that will reach out to the mainstream moviegoer, that could have been better. Hard sci-fi fans may finds this a tad too tame, but will appreciate Jones and Ripley for trying to bring back the genre one small step at a time.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 77/100"

","I give this movie a seven because I must admit it kept my attention and was well acted/edited. However, although I realize this is just escapist lore, I think the ""science"" behind the time loop could have been better explained. One thing I noticed that, although he is cascading from one parallel universe to another, with each one being slightly different, the identity of the villain never changes. Also, how does the controller know that the returning controllee is the same entity that originally went on the mission? Nevertheless, as pure entertainment, and if one allows oneself to release everything learned in Physics 101, it's worth seeing."
"ajs-10","8","1","2","10 April 2011"," A nice piece of Sci-Fi... with a twist...
","Having watched, and loved, the first film directed by Duncan Jones, Moon (2009), I was very interested to see this, his second feature. Fortunately this time it was showing at my local cinema and I didn't have to make a forty mile round trip to see it. It's quite an interesting time-travel based story with a bit of a twist at the end. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please find that bomber and save the day while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Colter Stevens is a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan who wakes up on a train sitting across from a beautiful woman, Christina Warren. He is confused and disorientated at first, but after a while he begins to calm down. Just as he thinks everything is going to be alright, BOOM the train blows up and he finds himself back in some kind of capsule. The face of Colleen Goodwin appears on a monitor and asks him if he has found the bomber. Even more confusion sweeps over Stevens as he tries to figure out just what has happened to him. Goodwin calms him down and sends him back in, explaining that it is very important that he finds the bomb and the bomber. She also explains that he will only have eight minutes each time. Going back, he realises that the woman across from him is a friend of the person he is inhabiting. He goes back quite a few times, each time to the same point in time and each time he discovers more about Christina and each time he gets closer to finding the bomber. He eventually becomes obsessed with saving Christina and the other passengers, and to this end he takes a massive risk. I will end my summary here, don't want the Spoiler Police after me.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film with lots of attention to detail, everything fits and everything works pretty well. There are overtones of Groundhog Day (1993), in that a time period is repeated, but I found this one very different. One of the best performances from Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens since Donnie Darko (IMO). Michelle Monaghan did a good job as Christina Warren as did Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin. Also an honourable mention goes to Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Routlege.<br/><br/>Although not as good as 'Moon', IMO, I really liked this film and I would watch it again. It's nicely paced, there's a pretty good soundtrack, although it's quite subdued and at ninety three minutes, it's not too long. Over all, it's a well written, nicely paced piece of science fiction with quite a nice twist at the end. Comparisons have been made with 'Inception' but I'm not even going to go there, they are totally different Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.3/10"
"Ben_Horror","8","1","2","4 April 2011"," BANG, rewind, BANG, rewind...
","Time travel stories are a penny a dozen and as old as hills themselves, so it's always a challenge for filmmakers to come up with a new spin on a very old tale. This is where 'Source Code' comes in and thankfully, it succeeds.<br/><br/>Plot-wise the movie is very succinct: there's been a tragic terrorist incident involving a bomb on a Chicago train that resulted in huge loss of life. Another attack is imminent. Jake Gyllenhal plays a soldier – Colter Stevens - who's participating in a top secret experiment – the 'source code' of the title – whose job is to investigate the 8 minutes preceding the explosion so he can ascertain the identity of the bomber and hopefully prevent another catastrophe. The one negative side effect of this is he's ends up being constantly sent back in time only to get blown up again and again - until he can find out what exactly happened.<br/><br/>The movie plays out in a 'rinse and repeat' fashion, advancing bit by bit, gradually – and enticingly - revealing more and more information each time. With every replay, we see a new item of information or something we haven't really noticed before. If this scenario reminds you of a certain comedy starring Bill Murray and a groundhog, then you're not far wrong. It's the same basic concept of 'rewinding' time, but whereas the explanation of that movie was left to the viewer to decide how or why it was happening, Source Code tells you up front that there's a Sci-fi angle anchoring everything. You could also throw other movies like Vantage Point into the mix and you'll get the general drift that we're seeing a single event played out umpteenth times.<br/><br/>But thankfully there's a bit more going on besides endless 'play and rewinds' as Colter Stevens also has to figure out his place in the whole 'Source Code' experiment and as with the bomb plot, nuggets of information is given away at just enough intervals to keep the whole thing from becoming too repetitious. <br/><br/>The film is very well executed and acted. The scenario is intriguingly set up and the way it's told will have you glued to the screen from start to finish. In fact you won't want to drop your guard once – you'll be that intent on finding out what's going on in the increasing baffling narrative. The science of the time traveling is also very imaginative and is explained just enough for you to go along with the whole scenario. Of course there is a lot of mumbo-jumbo about quantum physics, but at the same time they don't overdo it to such an extent that you feel you're going to come down with a sever case of the Zzzzs anytime soon. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the confused time travel guinea pig Colter Stevens and he effortlessly manages to anchor the whole potentially confusing scenario with a likable presence. He's entirely relatable as the 'every man' caught up in the nightmarish situation. Likewise Michelle Monaghan plays her part with a very appealing 'girl next door' quality and even if most of her role in the movie is of the 'rewinding' variety, it says something that she never allows it to go stale. Jeffery Wright is also excellent as the cold, limping, 'by the book' scientist who's spearheading the entire operation without a shred of morals on display. <br/><br/>Director Duncan Jones' last movie was Moon and admittedly this movie shares a similar DNA to it in that there's a lot of stuff about the nature of identity, second chances, and other life affirming messages, though as with Moon, you have to get through a lot of darkness before you get to the bright stuff. As with Christopher Nolan, he seems to have certain themes and traits that he's evidently very interested in.<br/><br/>The only letdown of this film is, so intent are the film makers/ distributors not to insult certain lucrative foreign markets, they're at pains to sledgehammer home the whole 'never judge a book by its cover' idea, which is a little bit of a disappointment considering the biggest threat to US security is from the very regions they're so keen to avoid offending in the first place. That's the only part of the movie that doesn't quite ring through, which is a shame considering everything else is so damn good. <br/><br/>Like the aforementioned Groundhog Day and Vantage Point before it, the biggest disadvantage of movies like this, is they have a low 'rewatchability' factor because they're so dependent on retelling the same event over and over. They generally wear out their welcome faster than a normal movie because the viewer becomes so familiar with the story beats that after even two viewings, it feels like you've already seen it a dozen times. Source Code is the same. Basically you get all the surprises the first time, but as a first time viewing experience, it's truly excellent stuff and will keep you hooked to the very end."

","""Source Code"" deals with interesting issues and themes for which if i reveal them then it could be seen as a spoiler alert, so i guess you'll have to see it for yourself to see if you can highlight them, but what i can say is that with an exceptional cast and a clever plot which is easy to follow, ""Source Code"" keeps you watching to see if you can see where the twists and turns will be coming from. Jake Gyllenhaal brings substance to his character and the film and is a great actor in this film. His co-star Michelle who played in ""Eagle Eye"" (2008) plays a similar role for which she does really well and both of them together have a great chemistry. There's not much more to say except that it has a great cast, cool and original plot with cool twists and turns coming your way!"
"Meven_Stoffat","2","2","7","25 May 2011"," Better than expected but still cheesy and annoying
","I'll admit I went in to Source Code with zero expectations at all- it didn't look very appealing from the trailer. However, I'll admit I did like a few parts. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectual science fiction thriller. <br/><br/>The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train. <br/><br/>The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his. The plot is so deathly slow, dull, and takes nearly forever to get going, and one of the worst endings EVER absolutely ruins what could have been a good action thriller to begin with. Overall, avoid. <br/><br/>OVERALL: 2/10 <br/><br/>PROS: -Gorgeously shot -Nice special effects <br/><br/>CONS: -Pretty much everything else -One of the worst scripts of 2011, almost this year's ""Salt"" -Boring buildup to a total non-conclusion -Some of the worst acting this side of Community Theatre"

Here, it's Colter Stevens who is plugged in, as attempts are made to locate who had planted the fatal bomb, in order to prevent the bomber from an even greater attack. Army Captain Stevens, thinking that he's in a simulation, is quite prepared to assault anyone in that simulation, but each time he fails, he learns a little more. He even learns that he is (I guess) at death's door - or perhaps as suggested in That Hideous Strength, his brain alone survived death. Whatever, I will never know, as at point 41.25 he yelled the f-word. In my books, at that point he assaulted me - I value marriage. So abused, I left the film with a nasty taste in my mouth. I'd give it zero rating if possible."

It's marginally less tedious.<br/><br/>This film has clearly received a high rating as its focused almost entirely on a single character as per films such as gran Torino, which apparently makes a film clever.<br/><br/>Gladly I took it back and replaced it, because I fancied a drive, otherwise it would have been snapped and binned, rubbish."

"Pining-For-The-Fjords","3","1","3","15 February 2016"," Broken premise
","This movie is by itself not so bad, it's just based on a broken premise. That's the reason why you can't get into it: the story doesn't allow you to ""think along"" as it develops, because you don't understand the rules that the whole sci-fi situation is based on. At the end, you realize that they're just making up new rules as they go along, until it makes no sense anymore.<br/><br/>At first, very little is explained: Jake Gyllenhaal is a soldier who keeps getting zapped onto a train, 8 minutes before it blows up. The commander in charge pushes off any of his questions with ""there's no time for this"", which gets annoying very quickly.<br/><br/>Then some scientist guy explains the premise, and I have to say that at first it sounded really cool to me: turns out he's not being sent back in time, but rather being uploaded into a computer program, based on the last 8 minutes of memory of one guy who died on that train. At this point I'm thinking: ""whoa this is an original idea!"" <br/><br/>But then ... the soldier starts making all kinds of moves far outside the confines of what the dead guy could have experienced: he finds the bomb, gets off the train, shoots a guy, and so on. At this point, I started to question my own intelligence first. How is he doing these things? This was also the time my girlfriend gave up on the movie. Me, I was still hoping that it would end up making sense.<br/><br/>Then at the end, though his job of finding the criminal is done, the soldier starts pleading about how he wants to go back one more time to save the train. The scientist explains to him for the third of fourth time that it wouldn't change anything, because it's not a time machine. But he keeps going on and on about how he wants to save everyone and he just wants one shot to try and save the train.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm literally yelling at my TV screen: ""IT'S A COMPUTER PROGRAM DUMBASS!!"" Yet sure enough, they send him back one more time, he manages to saves the train and ... WAIT, WHAT? ... He actually changes the present!? Yup, suddenly the train blowup never even happened, because Gyllenhaal changed the past and stopped it from inside a magical computer program! Why? Because ... reasons!!<br/><br/>And that's when I realized that it wasn't me, this movie just bases itself on trying to be ""Groundhog Day meets Quantum Leap"", but it doesn't care at all about making a clear premise and sticking to it. It just makes it up as it goes along, and for a sci-fi movie, that's a pretty unsatisfying thing to watch."

","A story like ""Source Code"", something that feels petty damn close to hard science fiction, feel like a breath of fresh air. To me, anyway. When you peel away the mind-bending technology/fantasy of the script, it's really just a guy trying to do something heroic and change history. That's appealing any way you slice it. Even the inherent ""Groundhog Day"" comparison is a favorable one.<br/><br/>Superficially speaking, I just enjoyed gazing at Vera Farmiga ad Michelle Monaghan for 90 minutes (two different flavors of winsome). But more importantly, Gyllenhaal is a great choice for he lead. And it's beautifully edited - the pacing is breakneck.<br/><br/>Good movie all-around.<br/><br/>7/10"
"mmmischael","7","1","3","15 May 2015"," Interesting film, interesting ideas, recommend...
","This film was very interesting, it's for people who likes scientific, fantastic and mystic genre. Main idea was that there are parallel dimensions and these dimensions are made by the time. Every moment has its own logical extension and we cannot change time or move between these dimensions, but it's very interesting what would be if we can? In Duncan Jones' opinion we can change somethings in the past, this develops new future, which would be the independent from other future (where from we've applied changes). I think there were 3 different demotions in this film: first it was saved Chicago, Second was place were Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) are together and third was demotion where Christina Warren receive message. I thing all three dimensions would have its own extension. But... When I saw this film I liked but also I had strange felling (negative). I agree users who thinks Source Code is mix of some films like: Groundhog Day; Sliding Doors; Blind Chance; Johnny Got His Gun etc. Also Colter Stevens take a place of Sean Fentress, but where is Sean? How did he disappear? I think this fact abrogates balance."

Why cant I get off my seat?<br/><br/>All of your questions will be answered as the movie progresses and no plot-hole will be left unturned.<br/><br/>Character Development:<br/><br/>We have a twitchy Jake Ghyllenhaal who does justice to his character of an anxious soldier who wants answers, who wants to know why he's in a train, who doesn't recognise his face. He slowly understands that he is on a mission. Colter Stevens (Jake Ghyllenhaal) is a well developed character who has a lot of back story and reason to be in the movie and his back story makes you have a special bond with him.<br/><br/>We have the girl next door Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) who doesn't have anything to do before the 2nd half of the movie. Although, they did need someone talking to the protagonist in the entire movie and the way the movie starts-off, one would think that she was needed since the beginning but after re-watching several times, one would then start to raise questions over her character. A decently developed character no doubt.<br/><br/>We have a bossy but good-hearted Colleen Goodwin (Vera Fermiga). Who plays a crucial role in the movie, her staying to the topic type attitude does save a lot of time for the movie to show us the things we want to see. There was no back story for this character but to be honest, it wasn't even needed because this character was complete without one.<br/><br/>We have a strict Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who aims for the goal he sets and nothing else. He performs just like any government agency top gun would. Doesn't want to answer any questions and only wants answers. The maker of the source code and an egotistical man who would sacrifice anyone (not himself) to get the job done.<br/><br/>While watching Source Code, you will accuse everyone you see in the entire 93 minutes. Source Code doesn't only give you chills but also explains itself. This isn't the type of movie where the main focus is only on finding the villain. It gives you a great concept of how a man can go to the same place again and again for answers, it shows you the importance of life, it shows you how a man fights for his rights and it shows you how one lunatic can harm so many people.<br/><br/>Direction: <br/><br/>The scenes are brilliantly directed, being in the train for most of the 93 minutes, the director made it look so easy and the setting for all the scenes was perfect.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>*The acting by all the characters<br/><br/>*The direction and the movie's setting<br/><br/>*The fresh idea<br/><br/>*Focusing on more than one thing<br/><br/>*The mystery and thrill<br/><br/>*The length of the movie<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>*The character Christina Warren being bland <br/><br/>*The antagonist's foolish motive for the bombing<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Source Code has it all, the action, the thrill, the chill, the love story, the bonding with the characters, a fresh idea that delivers. You will be seeing more than a mystery thriller. The direction and acting delivers, the story delivers but a couple of things fail.<br/><br/>Christina Warren, a main character looks a bit bland and out of sync with the story in the first half. And the antagonist who has one of the most idiotic reasons to kill people even for a movie.

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter and couldn't have been cast better. Gyllenhaal works much harder than most actors his age, as shown in this thriller. Colter is woken up on an unfamiliar train that involves many different types of people including the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. After the train suddenly explodes in Chicago, Colter wakes up to a secret government agency that has Colter go back in time to try and find the source of the bombing. We later find out much more about this agency and about Colter. Ben Ripley does a smart job as a writer by starting of right in the middle of Colter's situation without him knowing anything about what he is going to experience throughout the film. We start off in a peculiar setting and adapt to the conflict just as Colter does. Each time Colter fails it's fun to have to go back in time to stop the bomb all over again.There's always have something to fix and find out. Director Duncan Jones did disappoint me. He does do a good job of adding constant ignorance and suspense, but he isn't dark enough. The weak visual elements and mediocre explosions take away the darkness of this terrifying plot. A lame crucial score, shallow dialogue and a poor ending that seems sort of like a cop out take away the complexity this thriller has to offer. Seeing Colter transform back to the past every time is shot in a very cheesy way as well. ""Source Code' excels at what it tries to. Jones' direction is full of shocking entertainment and has a very unique plot that is unlike most films. We have many questions that all get answered eventually. The brilliant editing to make going back to the past the same and different each time is fun to see in Colter's point of view after he familiarizes himself with his setting. The action is balanced with touching drama and a big heart."

","Jake Gyllenhaal plays Capt.

It's his mission to find the terrorist responsible.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this, especially the ending which (despite the super happily-ever-after) is open to interpretation or possibly even a sequel. I also loved how this movie slowly unravelled itself, with more pieces unveiled to both Colter and the audience with each subsequent 8 minute trip he took. I wasn't all that surprised by Colter's condition but it was still shocking and very sad. <br/><br/>A pretty great movie I'm still thinking about.05.13"

","I rented Source Code from my library because I like Jake Gyllenhall, and had never really heard of this film.<br/><br/>I was really surprised how good the whole package was. Gyllenhall is excellent as a military type name Colt whose last memories are of being in a combat mission in Afghanistan. Suddenly he finds himself waking up on a train near Chicago. He's like - yikes! what is going on, and who is this babe (Michelle Monaghan) talking to me that I don't know.<br/><br/>Time goes along, and next thing you know, an event happens and now he finds himself if a metal box-like structure, with a military-type woman talking to him.<br/><br/>He discovers he's part of this mission to try to find a bomber who is doing bad things around Chicago. As time goes along, he understands the gravity of the situation, what his real situation is, and what his options are. Then he goes back and repeatedly goes into this short time frame to try and find this bomber. It's really cool how each time he goes back, he has more and more comfort with his situation, because he keeps the memory of what he learned, and builds upon it. Gyllenhall skillfully plays with that to the max, especially at the end.<br/><br/>Monaghan is terrifically cute and just the right foil for Gyllenhall's craziness. They have excellent chemistry. The movie succeeds with a terrific ending that only Hollywood can give you.<br/><br/>This movie is a combo of so many different films, but it's still different, and keeps you guessing. Combine like Groundhog Day, Memento, Total Recall, and part of the Matrix, and you have Source Code. Outstanding work, really worth your time. <br/><br/>Enjoy"
"bowmanblue","8","1","3","29 May 2014"," Yes, it is 'Groundhog Day,' but with explosions
","There's no other way to describe 'Source Code,' without comparing it to the classic comedy film, Groundhog Day. However, whereas Bill Murray was stuck in a day and had to get out, Jake Gyllenhaal's take is a little more specific: he's a member of a top secret military project who has to find out who planted a bomb on a crowded commuter train by 'living' the last eight minutes of one of the – now deceased – passenger's life.<br/><br/>So, ala Groundhog Day, we get basically the same scene endlessly repeated with Jake learning a little more about his surroundings and the various perils he'll have to face as he goes along. There's not an awful lot more you can say about the film without giving important points away. And, with Source Code, less is definitely more. It's certainly not a long film and it's well shot and paced, largely to its director, Duncan (son of David Bowie) Jones. It's basically a simple, no-frills film and, if you're in the mood for some – slightly more – intelligent science fiction, then you could do worse than this one.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

After hearing that the director will be in charge of an anticipated film I'm looking forward to, I had two choices, to watch Source Code or Moon. Source Code seemed the more appealing, and I'm really glad I picked this flick up. The plot itself is simple yet makes you think. By the end of the film I was in tears. The emotional and ethic writing that has gone into this film is phenomenal. I recommend this film to anyone who loved Inception style thrillers. Jake Gyllenhall was exceptional in this film.<br/><br/>9/10, extremely good."
"grantss","7","1","3","21 March 2014"," Needs a Director's Cut...
","Good, but had the potential to be brilliant. Great central plot: sort of Ground Hog Day meets Charlie Kaufman (esp Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) meets Philip K Dick (esp Minority Report) meets Christopher Nolan (esp Memento and Inception). <br/><br/>However, the clever central plot isn't enough to make a decent-length film out of, so there are some detours and padding (eg a romantic angle), and this detracts from the film. Then, just when I thought the movie had redeemed itself for all the padding by having a picture- perfect ending, that wasn't the ending. There is a final twist after the ending-that-should-have-been, and this is totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son) shows that Moon was no one-off: he is a director with a great future. He just needs more control over his movies - the tacked-on ending smacks of corporate interference.<br/><br/>Great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, and I am generally not a fan (though Donnie Darko and Jarhead were great). Good support from Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga.<br/><br/>If ever a movie needed a Director's Cut, this is it."
"MartinHafer","9","1","3","10 March 2014"," Brilliantly inventive...and yet another wonderful film from Duncan Jones.
","During the last week, I've become a HUGE fan of Duncan Jones. That's because I saw his amazing sci-fi film ""Moon"" (which he wrote and directed), his short ""Whistle"" and his latest ""Source Code"". These three films, all super-well made and inventive, represent the three films Jones has so far made--and I can pretty much guarantee you'll see a lot more from him because these three films are simply amazing.<br/><br/>I scored ""Source Code"" a 9--which is actually not quite as high as I rated ""Moon"", but the film sure came close to also getting a 10. The plot is so inventive and the film made so well that I can't see why it isn't scored higher than 7.5 on IMDb.<br/><br/>When the film begins, Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a train heading into Chicago. He knows no one aboard and is NOT the person people think he is. He is, in fact, a soldier serving in Afghanistan--so how did he magically appear on the other side of the planet?!?! While this is only the beginning of the film, I will say no more because the film has one surprise after another--and I'd hate to ruin the film for you.<br/><br/>In many ways, the film plays a lot like ""Inception"", ""Groundhog Day"" and a bit of ""The Sum of All Fears"". However, this is a great oversimplification--there is so much more to the film than this. Wonderful acting, wonderful direction and a thrill-a-minute script make this a must-see film. Really...you MUST see this film."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","1","3","29 January 2014"," Duncan Jones' solid follow up to Moon.
","Source Code is the second feature film by director Duncan Jones who directed the fantastic Moon. After I finished watching Moon a few years back, I instantly went to IMDb and checked what Jones had in the works. After reading the plot synopsis for Source Code, I immediately started looking forward to it. The wait was certainly worth it. <br/><br/>Source Code centers around Captain Colter Stevens, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who finds himself in the body of another man while traveling on a commuter train that's doomed to explode. Stevens' mission is to find the man who bombed the train. Each time he fails, he is sent back in for another 8 minutes. Just like Groundhog Day, we see the same scenario and conversations over and over, but the scenes never get boring due to a mix of editing and alternate camera angles. <br/><br/>The 8 minute time constraints gives the film a certain urgency that's often attempted in film, but rarely executed to the extent in Source Code. As Stevens continues his search for the bomber in 8 minute bites of time, the film turns into an engaging ""who done it"". Not satisfied with just finding the bomber, Stevens sets out to find a way to save the passengers, particularly Christina Warren played by Michelle Monaghan. Stevens is told that this is impossible because the fate of the people on the train is already set and that time on the train only exists in that 8 minute memory. This knowledge doesn't keep him from trying. <br/><br/>Source Code has another interesting aspect and that is how Captain Stevens even got involved with the Source Code. In between trying to find the bomber/save the passengers on the train, Stevens is trying to solve who he is. <br/><br/>I thought that they could have given Monaghan a little bit more to do, but watching the relationship between Stevens and Mongahan blossom in 8 minute intervals is truly heartwarming. The more Stevens blows up on the train, the more he empathizes with Warren. The sorrow can be seen on Gyllenhaal's face every time he looks at Warren. Knowing that she is doomed only drives him more to find a way to saver her. <br/><br/>Maybe the most memorable parts of the film is at the end of the 8 minutes when the train repeatedly explodes. It sounds odd to say, but the explosion is portrayed in such a beautifully tragic way. <br/><br/>Source Code has similar elements from some great films including 12 Monkeys, Groundhog Day, and even Inception. Unlike Inception that doesn't even try to burden the viewer with the ins and outs of how they are able to enter dreams, Source Code explains its physics in an easy to understand way. That's not to say you don't have to suspend belief a little bit. <br/><br/>Source Code feels like a lot of popular Sci-fi films, but it takes the viewer in unexpected directions. Watching the same 8 minutes over and over again never gets old and only adds to the building tension of the film. All in all, Source Code is the best film I've seen this year and one of the better Sci-fi films I've seen in years."
"just_lo777","8","1","3","17 December 2013"," Put on a ""Must Watch"" List
","First of all I got to say that I'm not a big fan of both Jake Gyllenhaal nor Michelle Monaghan so the movie must be so good that I like it that much despite their presence. It's one of those mind twisting movies that you must pay attention to every single word they say and to every single detail to be able to understand it very well . There are those moments when you get so confused and it's OK, just go with the flow and keep watching because everything is getting clearer by time. For the story, it's sci-fi but more like realistic one since it happens NOW not at some time in the future when people use laser guns and dress as astronauts. It will blow your mind with every scene but in a good way. Although it is sci-fi you can easily relate to the events and you can't stop wondering what if this is true and what if this actually can happen or what if it's happening now and that we are just part of it. I just didn't like the ending and that's the reason I gave it 8. It was some sort of mind-blowing open end that will make you unable to stop thinking maybe for few days trying to figure it out but I guess only good movies can make your mind go like this. For the performances, Jake's Performance was really good and he managed to take it to a higher level while Michelle's performance is exactly the same as all her other roles. She act in the same exact way no matter what is her character, the story or the other cast members. In the end, all I can say is that you will enjoy it specially that it is story is not one of those that had been done for 1000 times before. It will expand your imagination and the way you think .<br/><br/>For my questions about the movie, it goes like this (It contains spoilers): What kind of ending is that??? I mean I spent two hours to understand the whole idea then they blew it all off by the last scene. Does that ending mean that he just escaped to Sean's body and continued his life being aware of his own death? Is he completing his life as Sean without knowing that he is Stevens in the first place or he is aware of his death and being in Sean's body in the source code? How did Goodwin get the message while it was sent only in the Source code? How did his father reply to him and say all those things? Was it made by his mind where he imagined that this what his father would say? Does it mean that all of this was just a little part of a huge simulation that live in thinking it's the reality? Yeah I know he said that in his message but yet it doesn't make any sense. I think it would be better if they ended it right after Stevens and Christina were hanging out."
"DanielMorel","9","1","3","19 November 2013"," A movie I should have seen earlier!
","I only got around to watching this movie a week ago. When it first came out, I thought ""ohh great another Hollywood action movie"" so I never watched it. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>The plot centres around a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) who seemingly wakes up in someone else's body on a train opposite a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) who knows him. After 8 minutes, the train explodes, killing everyone, only he wakes up in a capsule of some sort talking to a woman who tells him that he was inside the Source Code, which allows him to relive someone else's life eight minutes before their death, except with free will to make choices and to change outcomes. His mission is to find out who planted the bomb before the attacker in the real world strikes again.<br/><br/>Director Duncan Jones (who also directed 'Moon', another great movie) does an excellent job with this film. He incorporates plot twists and a method of slowly unravelling the story. 'Moon' and this movie made me cry at the end. Jake Gyllenhaal, who performed excellently in 'The Day After Tomorrow' doesn't disappoint with this film, showing off his convincing emotions and great acting. Michelle Monaghan also provides a strong supporting role in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film despite some bad reviews. 'Source Code' will not disappoint, provided that you can understand the story (I did but just to make sure I had to look it up after). Watch it!"
"zombiedeathbot77","8","1","3","31 August 2013"," Excellent little sci-fi thriller which will reward those viewers who can discern the logic.
","Maybe there aren't any truly original ideas left in Hollywood, but occasionally a movie comes along and shows you something you have seen before in a unique and unexpected way. Think 12 Monkeys meets Groundhog Day with a twist ending. Top notch acting all around, Gyllenhall especially. The way the story unfolds and particularly the ending may be confusing and unacceptable to some viewers, but I am of the opinion that it all makes perfect sense. The viewer has to take into account that what the scientists are doing is experimental, and that the process they are using works differently than expected. Overall source Code is one of the most entertaining and well thought out sci-fi thrillers in recent memory. 8/10"
"jjgooner","8","1","3","1 July 2013"," The Most Original Thriller In Years
","Source Code<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>93 mins/12<br/><br/>Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Michael Arden<br/><br/>Director: Duncan Jones<br/><br/>Plot: Soldier, Colter Stevens, is on an assignment to find out who placed a bomb on a train in Chicago. He is forced to keep reliving the moment until he finds the bomber.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: Source Code opens with some overhead shots of the city of Chicago. These shots are beautiful and although seen many times before, feel completely original. This is down to constant uses of many shades of blue that stand out in the city. There are no feminine colours; just masculine. These describe the film perfectly. Source Code is a man's dream thriller showing a true, down to earth character making realistic decisions. When other films would just give the guy a gun, Source Code gives the guy a brain and a good deal of common sense. Another point is that (like the opening shots in the city) although we have seen similar plot elements in films like Groundhog Day, Inception and Robocop, Source Code feels so original.<br/><br/>The film centres on Colter Stevens, a soldier who keeps returning to the same eight minutes in time to find out who is planting bombs on trains all around Chicago. These scenes are very intense and suspenseful and the film uses that clever trick to keep the audience interested; don't overload the film with detail, just reveal each little bit every few scenes or so. Of course, in a movie cliché, Colter gets easily distracted and falls semi-in-love with Michelle Monaghan. Although this may frustrate the viewer as they wish to see the film move on, it is pretty realistic. Jake Gyllenhaal brings an honest feel to his hero role and, like I already mentioned, acts like a normal person would. He really brings the character's despair and frustration of having to see the same people die over and over again. The rest of the cast performs well, with Jeffrey Wright making a great transformation into the serious header of the operation. Vera Famiga and Michelle Monaghan also put in solid performances, Famiga as the only person Colter can communicate with in-between his mission.<br/><br/>Source Code, despite probably defying many laws of quantum physics, is entertaining, pretty original and extremely well-paced."
"Uriah43","7","1","3","3 March 2013"," Manages to Entertain All the Way Through
","""Captain Colter Stevens"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a helicopter pilot who finds himself on a train under another person's identity by the name of ""Sean Fentress"" and he is looking for a person who has already blown it up. If that isn't strange enough, he also has only 8 minutes to find the man responsible, otherwise he has to go back and search again in order to stop a ""dirty bomb"" from exploding in downtown Chicago. Now, while all of this might sound confusing, the different scenarios actually dovetail into a very imaginative film. Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a fine performance as does Michelle Monaghan as his female friend ""Christina Warren"". And while there isn't much action and the suspense is low-key for the most part, this movie still manages to entertain all the way through. All things considered then, I thought this was a very enjoyable film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

","Take a measure of science, add copious science fiction, a few dashes of ""Groundhog Day"", a touch of ""Deja Vu"" and ""Premonition"", and presto you have Source Code.<br/><br/>The first minutes of this film, eight minutes in story time, are a little edgy, uneasy, as if the actors are not sure where things are going, and I am captivated. Slowly a difficult first experience is made easier as the film reveals a deliciously inventive plot and sub-plot. And our main characters play it out so extraordinarily cleverly as the explanations for early clumsiness come thick and fast. And that is one of the exceptional talents of this film as it changes up the gears but keeps the suspense lingering right the way through.<br/><br/>The editing, cinematography and soundtrack are very well done, and the sets are a work of art. Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal are excellent and there is very good support from elsewhere too, as things rev up towards the final fifteen minutes or so.<br/><br/>There are bound to be a few people who'll point out the impossibility, scientifically, of what we see, but remember they'll only be correct through what we think we know, not what we may come to learn. And this film does its own thinking on its feet to come up with a clever, and somewhat unpredictable, ending.<br/><br/>This is more than worth a watch especially if you are feeling down and out.

"n8hale","8","1","3","1 February 2013"," The Source Code is AMAZING
","So Source Code... a great movie with the one and only... Jake Gyllenhaal! His performance in this movie was excellent(as usual). BUT I'll get to that in a second. MOVIE INFO The movie Source Code came out into theaters on April 1, 2011 and I actually saw it in the theaters. ""An action thriller centered on a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man and discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train."" -imdb. This movie is rated PG-13 with a running time of one hour thirty-three minutes. Directed by Duncan Jones (Moon). Starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye), Vera Farminga (The Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Casino Royale). REVIEW I really enjoyed this film! It had a mixture of thriller, sci-fi, mystery, and even a little bit of romance! (But if we be honest here, every film nowadays has a bit of romance). If you like the kind of movies that keep you on the edge of your seat because you just want to find out what the secret is, what the answer is to the mystery, then you will really enjoy this film! Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter. He keeps waking up on the same train, and he only has eight minutes to stop a bomb that is on the train. So the whole entire movie he is searching for the bomb, and especially who is in charge of the bomb. That's where the whole ""edge of the seat"" experience comes in. The whole movie you start guessing who is behind the problem, who is really in charge of the bomb that will be exploding. I myself had quite a few thoughts on who it could be, but of course I was wrong. It's a great story plot! Did it leave up to its expectations? Yes! Now the first time I saw this in the theaters I didn't like it as much, only because I had such high expectations for it and so I was expecting the next best movie! But after watching it almost two years after the release for the first time since then, I really enjoyed it! I'm always into a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal because I just think he is an amazing actor. He played his roll excellent. Think about it. It'd be hard to play someone waking up on a train, not even knowing who you are, and trying to stop a bomb you know nothing about! But he nailed the roll and, like always, delivered a great performance. Michelle Monaghan was also very good for her roll. It's not like she was so amazing that I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the roll, no. I could imagine several other actresses that would've also delivered good performances, but she was great! I really liked her character, Christina, too! *spoilers* When you finally got to find out who the person was that was behind the bomb attack on the train, I must honestly say I was sort of let down. It's not because of the fact that ""the guy who dropped his wallet"" was the one, it was the way they presented it. Jake Gyllenhaal calls the guy's number and finds out it is him, and then____ nothing. He confronts the guy turns off the bomb and well that's the end. Everyone is saved. I just wish that when you find out who the person ended up being, they would've made it more dramatic. I wish Jones would've set the tone for that part. That is my only complaint. Overall Grade: B+ I give it a B+ because it was a great film and I really enjoyed it all, but just the way they showed the audience who the person was, wasn't enough for me. I felt that we've been waiting to see that part the whole movie, in fact ever since we saw the first trailer, and then when we actually did find out, it was just like ""oh. that guy..."" I just wish it would've lead up to the mystery bad guy in a better, more dramatic way. I hope you all enjoyed this review! I recommend this movie big time! Thanks for reading!"
"gary-444","8","1","3","30 December 2012"," A Fine 21st Century Sci Fi Film
","After the commercial ,and critical success of Moon, Director Duncan Jones was handed a bigger budget and bigger story for Source Code. The results are impressive. A student and aficionado of the Science Fiction genre, Jones takes a good plot idea and gives it a 21st century makeover to establish himself as a credible modern protagonist in the field.<br/><br/>Writer Ben Ripley's original idea is inspired- that an individual, in a parallel dimension might, for eight minutes, be able to affect the future, but not the past. This is ideal when you are trying to deal with a train and city threatening terrorist. In an amusing spin on Groundhog Day, our hero is able to keep returning until he gets it right, and thwarts the plot. Lead actors Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens and Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren lead the action well.<br/><br/>Jones worked the confined spaces of space station well in Moon, he also replicates a twist regarding the ambiguity of the exact circumstances of the main character. He replicates that skill well by placing most of the action in a single railway carriage. American Directors notoriously lose their way when given a fistful of dollars, rather than dimes, to finance their films, but not Jones. The money goes on one (frequently reprised) set piece action sequence and a convincing set and cgi. The result is compelling, thought provoking, entertaining and gripping.<br/><br/>In a style which will excite Hollywood , the film is intelligent, but never self-indulgent and at 90 minutes is generally tight. Yet it is not flawless. A minor irritation is the inclusion of comic Russell Peters in a cameo role, demonstrably a fairly cynical attempt to create a broader North American market. It is unnecessary as he is not funny, although he apparently kept the cast amused between filming. The more significant failing is an appalling bolted on Hollywood ending that might have undermined the entire film if what had gone before had not been so good. Two excellent opportunities to end the film, a kiss and a freeze frame, are eschewed in favour of absurd schmaltz and a platform for a sequel. This is a shame, because the romance between the leads works well and reeks of a post production fix."
"reviewer135","7","1","3","28 November 2012"," great thought provoking movie but loses it at the end
","This was a very well acted and great story line movie. the premise is that a dead person has 8 minutes of short term memory that is retained in their brain after death. The another person could ""inject themselves"" into this short term memory time window and relive the last moments of a persons life. To me this was a unique and interesting concept. It is very believable that such technology may one day exist to essentially ""playback"" a person's dieing short term memories. So the movie gradually builds on this theme and it does make you think. However the movie crashes in the end, again in my opinion. I will be the first to admit that maybe I just didn't get it but i didn't get it. The ending turned supernatural with time travel fantasy that really detracted from a good movie. Still it is definitely worth a rent and watch."

Believable characters and superb acting by all involved, including the bit-part passengers on the ill-fated commuter train. The concept of Source Code, while fantastic, leaves me wondering what might have happened on 9/11 had this program really existed. Source Code is like a jigsaw puzzle. At first all you have are meaningless pieces until, one by one, they are fitted together to reveal the final picture. Source Code not only completes the picture, but also has it framed and hung on the wall. I thoroughly enjoy the trip it takes me on. My only question about the film is what happened to the essence of Sean, the passenger taken over by the essence of Colter Stevens? Everyone on the train was eventually saved, yet Sean is somehow left in Limbo. I think I smell a sequel in the making. If so, I hope it's as good as this!

","The concept where a particular past juncture in time is re-visited in order to effect a change in future circumstances, was marvelously handled in the brilliant comedy-fantasy, 'Groundhog Day'. 'Source Code' utilizes a similar concept, but here it should basically be subsumed under the genre of Sci-fi Thriller. Unlike 'Groundhog Day', which repeatedly brings a time-tripping Bill Murray back to the past by sleight of hand, 'Source Code' provides a pseudo-scientific rationale, which proves in the end to be decidedly derivative of other time travel tales we've seen before.<br/><br/>Our protagonist, former Army helicopter pilot, Colter Stevens, now severely injured and in a comatose state, is being used as part of a secret US Army project dubbed 'Source Code', to uncover the identity of an individual who bombed a Chicago commuter train, earlier that day. The creator of the project, Dr. Rutledge, and his assistant, Air Force Captain Goodwin, repeatedly keep sending Stevens back eight minutes prior to the bombing inside an experimental device which resembles a space capsule, in order to find out who planted the bomb so they can stop him from detonating an even more destructive dirty bomb in downtown Chicago, which the bomber has promised to do an hour later.<br/><br/>Stevens learns that he's unable to change events in the future reality which Goodwin and Rutledge are a part of, and is only able to be an observer. The Source Code enables Stevens to enter the body of one of the now deceased victims, Sean Fentress, and move about on the train in a parallel universe. While the basic events in each alternate time line are the same (the bomber always plants the bomb in the same place), due to Stevens/Fentress acting differently in each time line, the exact sequence of events is changed. The concept derives from 'Groundhog Day', where the core events end up as variations on a theme. The interactive aspect of the protagonist's abilities, can also be likened to the Star Trek holodeck, where a user is able to interact with a series of images which are mere projections of reality.<br/><br/>One can argue with all the pseudo-scientific explanations but the films' scenarists are basically asking the audience to suspend one's disbelief when it comes to the main premise. For some this is a big problem, but I found other areas of the film to take issue with. One of screenwriter Ben Ripley's big quandaries is how to develop Stevens' character arc in eight minute segments. You'll recall that Bill Murray's 'Phil' character in 'Groundhog Day' was a narcissist who needed to learn an important life's lesson about being a nice guy. He has a whole day (repeated multiple times) to transform himself. Here, we learn virtually nothing about Fentress as his back story is a cypher. When Stevens becomes Fentress, Ripley has him gradually warming up to the film's love interest, Christina Warren, after he acts gruffly toward her when Stevens makes his first 'time trip'. But Stevens/Fentress acts badly at first because Stevens is disoriented not because he has a character defect. So the transformation seems unnecessary and forced since Steven's only real goal is to prevent the bomber from causing further havoc.<br/><br/>Equally less charming are the assorted characters Stevens must deal with on the train and the methods he employs to find out whether they might be the particular villain he's looking for. Again, a comparison to 'Groundhog Day' is instructive. All of the characters Phil interacts with in the Groundhog Day universe, are utterly quirky and charming. Here, they're stereotypical--either obnoxious (bad comedian) or ineffectual (computer geek). What's more, Ripley lacks the imagination to come up with a series of interesting variants. All Stevens/Fentress ends up doing is awkwardly confronting each one of his suspects by ripping the bags they're carrying and spilling the contents on the ground and getting into some kind of physical or verbal confrontation.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest clue that 'Source Code' lacks gravitas, is in its choice of a convincing antagonist. Heaven forbid that Mr. Ripley would attempt to create a bad guy rooted in today's headlines. Instead of perhaps an Al Qaeda sympathizer, we're presented with a Mad Bomber of the 1950s dressed up as a modern day disaffected techie. When both the bad guys and the good guys in your movie don't seem very real, the stakes aren't very high and hence the tension on the 'suspense' meter, has got to be very low!<br/><br/>Finally, there's the whole question of a so-called 'twist ending' that doesn't seem to be very surprising at all. Remember, according to the rules of the alternate time line, changing events in a parallel universe, cannot change anything in the present real world. So when Stevens sends the text message to Goodwin that he's stopped the bomber and that the Source Code experiment worked, and Goodwin and Rutledge aren't even aware that any of those events have transpired, that's not the same world we experienced at the beginning of the film. Rather, it's an alternate universe where the 'happy ending' of Sean and Christina walking off into the sunset, is a reality. One other thing that did bother a lot of other people who have posted on the internet, is what happened to Sean once Stevens takes over his consciousness? I guess he's left screaming, inside the mirror!<br/><br/>Back in the real world, the reality of the train bombing remains unchanged. We do wonder, after all those time jumps, did Stevens have enough time to actually communicate the information about the bomber to Rutledge and Goodwin? Couldn't the bomber have easily driven to downtown Chicago and set off his dirty bomb given how much time Stevens was taking with his jumps and inside the capsule?<br/><br/>Source Code looks and feels more like a movie made exclusively for the Syfy channel. It keeps your interest in a basic way but certainly doesn't deserve all the accolades heaped upon it to date."

","Spoilers! I must admit I saw Moon and wanted to see this immediately after and am most impressed, it sort of reminded me of The Jacket with Keira Knightly and Adrian Brody. <br/><br/>I love the way director Duncan Jones takes his time to unravel a story, you learn with the main character what is going on every step of the way and grow to have empathy with him/her. <br/><br/>My only problem which I feel may have been caused by test screenings, which is mentioned quite frequently on IMDb is the ending. Just when it seemed to stop at the perfect moment, the main character finally gets to call his dad, arranges for a comedian to entertain the passengers and with seconds to live, kisses the girl and all the victims of the disaster are laughing and smiling and it freezes, I expected it to fade to black ... perfect, emotional and a logical conclusion. <br/><br/>but no.. it decides to go on a little longer as the couple go on a date, and there's a text message...and.. well it takes the shine off what would have been a truly memorable film. <br/><br/>Its still excellent though but so close to being perfect."
"Urantia","7","1","3","28 January 2012"," A Close Examination of One Scene
","SPOILER ALERT! Although the plot defied logic to me, there was one scene in particular that I liked more than any other scene in the movie. I'm referring to the freeze-frame scene near the end of the movie when the camera slowly zooms out from ""the kiss"" to pan across the frozen-in-time faces of other passengers on the previously doomed train of death. Aside from my curiosity as to how technologically this shot was realized, there was a much deeper fascination that appealed to me. Here were the smiling faces of individual personalities rescued from an alternate reality where they smiled no more as the ashes from their fading faces fell to the floor. I immediately began to reflect on the many thousands of souls whose mortal bodies were unjustly destroyed on September 11, 2001 and then I began to forget about the total number reported (a cold statistic) and I began to imagine what it would be like to have really known each and every person prematurely released from this world on 9/11...appreciating the subtle intricacies of each man and woman and child (including future projections of the unborn ones from expectant mothers who were snuffed out before they even had a chance to see their babies take their first breath)...taking the time to clearly focus on each one of them as a unique (one-of-a-kind) child of God just as the glass lens in the scene from this film took its time to allow that same kind of visual perception of each person to slowly sink in. And it's worth mentioning here that there was also some dialogue about LIFE near this scene that helped lead this train of thought to wherever it was going. Life. Death. Life Again. I mentioned God already. He was in there somewhere...inside these thoughts of mine. I'm not sure what He was saying. But I think perhaps He wanted me to know that this is what their smiling faces look like to Him when He puts them all back together again on the other side. God is good at fixing things that are broken, you know."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","3","27 December 2011"," Interesting and creative sci-fi twist to Groundhog Day and Deja Vu.
","It's easy to label Source Code as Groundhog Day crossed with Deja Vu. Easy but unavoidable.<br/><br/>The tale of a man named Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) who awakens on a train that he can't recall boarding across from a stranger who obviously feels she knows him and swiftly learns that he is not even in his own body has definite parallels to both films, and while it is definitely worth a look it ends up as a lesser film than both.<br/><br/>The central premise of Source Code is that the human mind can recall with great detail the final minutes of life - in this case the final 8. Ambitious scientist Dr Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) has discovered a method of jacking into the brain of a bystander and having a military man play through the closing minutes to see if they can funnel key information back to headquarters, information that might assist in learning about the circumstances behind the event, perhaps even something that might prevent future incidents.<br/><br/>In this case Stevens is inhabiting Shaun, a teacher aboard the morning train to Chicago, a train that also carries an explosive device that will kill thousands of innocent passengers in 8 minutes time. At the point of explosion Stevens has his consciousness sent back to an undisclosed location where his only contact is a female soldier named Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who he interacts with via a monitor. In the initial stages Stevens is quite literally in the dark, confused and disoriented, each time he is urged to go further and try new things, but Goodwin and ultimately Rutledge seem reluctant to stray from the briefest of scripts, something that frustrates Stevens no end. Then it is back to the train for 8 more minutes of trying to ascertain exactly what went on and to prevent another more serious attack on Chicago itself.<br/><br/>This is where the Groundhog Day scenario kicks in, though with 8 minutes instead of 24 hours. Stevens learns quickly that only his actions can differ from what actually happened, so it is like he is in a carefully scripted play where he is the only one allowed to improve. Shaun's traveling companion is a young colleague named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), and the carriage they are riding in has a group of passengers that over the many run throughs Stevens learns more and more about. Seeing as at the end of each 8 minutes the entire train-load dies Stevens rapidly learns that there needn't be any reluctance to interrupt, annoy and even beat down the passengers if it helps enlighten him - they're gonna die every time anyway - but this is where the minor flaw in the film happens for me.<br/><br/>Stevens makes what I feel are some boneheaded decisions repeatedly in his many runthroughs, then in subsequent situations knowing full well he is on the clock he loafs through the early minutes, wasting precious time, before charging headlong into flawed assumptions and illogical deductions. I realise that in a 90 minute film about one 8 minute scenario that perhaps they felt they had to pad out the running time somewhat but I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the dumb things this supposedly highly trained helicopter pilot was doing.<br/><br/>That aside however flawed I found the actions at times Source Code has a pretty solid premise that again is not too dissimilar from Deja Vu, which itself had vast holes in logic that required ignoring in order to enjoy the film more. That is the case here. If you think too hard about Source Code it is patently obvious that the whole thing makes precious little sense, but neither does Star Wars, The Matrix and dozens of other universally lauded films. Source Code is not ever going to threaten their position as a hot topic on various message boards but it is worth a look and in the early stages while you are attempting to piece together what is going on alongside Captain Stevens it is quite captivating.<br/><br/>I think the acting is a mixed bag, Farmiga is OK as Goodwin but reminds me too much of Kristen Wiig, who I find annoying. Wright channels Darth Vader with his speech patterns and deeper than usual tone and Monaghan is fine in a role that basically requires her to be puzzled for at least 6 minutes out of 8 as her train buddy acts in ways that she has never seen before. But obviously this is Gyllenhaal's gig, and I guess he is fine. I don't think he quite cracks the 'leading man / hero' ranks just yet though, but in a smaller budget film like this I'll give him a pass mark. He's definitely far more likable - or is it less hittable? - than Shia LeBeouf.<br/><br/>One last thing. In the dozen or so runthroughs where the early goings were exactly the same routine the ticket lady always asks 'Shaun' for his ticket, yet never Christina. Strange...<br/><br/>Final Rating - 7 / 10. Sure the story doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. But I'd rather watch this implausible creativity over a million lazy remakes and sequels. (Scream 4 anyone???)"

This movie has one of the most twisted, developed plots ever to be written. The acting was good. If you're able to understand it clearly, you can even point out information used for the film (which is what I did, making it more fun). It does get a little confusing near the end with the whole quantum physics thing. But if you're smart enough then you'll be able to understand - this movie is targeted at an age group that will mostly understand the confusing parts. But anyway, this movie has the rare mix of sci-fi and mystery. It almost like a science fiction detective movie. The acting was very realistic.

","I was really intrigued by the this movie after seeing the trailer. It looked like high excitement, just a bit of sci-fi, and action with a tad of romance all rolled into one. I couldn't have been more fooled. <br/><br/>This movie is such a disappointment. Without providing spoilers beyond what the trailer provides, the basic story line is an army helicopter pilot (Jake G.) wakes up on a train, but soon discovers he's not himself (literally), and soon after the train blows up. He then finds himself in a pod talking to another military figure who tests him and re-thrusts him back into the train scenario.<br/><br/>The plot unfolds slowly, as we gradually find out who Jake's character is, why he's in this situation, and why he's up against the clock to keep returning to the scene and solve the train bombing in the intermittent eight minute intervals. In this respect it's like Bill Murray's role in ""Ground Hog Day"". In the plot line itself, the sci-fi aspect takes us to ""Inception"" because the concepts presented really, really require you to suspend your disbelief and embrace this fantasy which goes from the believable to the ridiculous, by the end. <br/><br/>There are the traditional good guys, bad guys, and the hero on a quest to save the train (and the girl). <br/><br/>It is both exciting and boring at the same time, making you wish for the ending to come sooner. The only blessing is that it's a mere 93 minutes long. <br/><br/>In my opinion this was probably and action movie made for teenage boys, but I'm willing to bet even they would grow tired of it. <br/><br/>In summary. don't waste your time!"

","First off, I've seen enough bad M. Night Shyamalan (whose IMDb star rating has gone down on each successive film he's made since The Sixth Sense) to spot a poorly-concealed surprise twist, but not when it's the twist on the ends of the big, PCP-laced joint that the director was smoking instead of studying physics or even practicing common sense. <br/><br/>Second, yes, it was obvious he was dead. It was obvious he was going to somehow ""save"" the passengers, or at least the girl. It was obvious he was going to have sex with Heath Ledger on the upper deck of the train. Obviously.<br/><br/>Second off, NO, you cannot record a person's experiences from a stationary train seat (see the movie if you think I sound like a moron for wording it this way) and then upon playback relive totally different experiences through their eyes. That would be what we call ""imagination."" And, of course, the digital ""people"" on the Source Code train would not have the same spontaneous personalities of the actual people they represent. They would only do what they did in the original scenario, not react or ad-lib or zag when they really zigged. This would be like listening to a Beatles record from 1964, using a karaoke microphone to jack into your stereo and through it request that George hammer out a metal solo on Can't Buy Me Love...and then you just hear it magically add itself in.<br/><br/>Third, what mechanism in a phone or cell tower or satellite allows a text message to be sent into another dimension from said Beatles record? I mean ""Source Code?"" Confused?? So was my wife when I tried to tell her this half-assed plot!!<br/><br/>I'm not a realism Nazi. I like fantasy stuff. I like Sci-fi. I like movies with aliens and creatures and spirits and all of the other improbable stuff out there. What I don't like is a director who doesn't even bother to pick up a 12th grade science book, who after two feature films has already established a pattern for his plots and characters, and who pays homage to himself by *cleverly* disguising themes from his first film (for instance, Chesney Hawkes' ""The One And Only,"" used in both films). But at least he's not as bad as Tarantino in that respect.<br/><br/>~B. Rafferty<br/><br/>P.S. - Ways in which Source Code was like Moon:<br/><br/><ul><li>Main characters are not who they think they are, so to speak - There are many different ""versions"" of the main character, clones in Moon and alternate realities in Source Code - Each main character has a loved one he can't contact - Each main character has a face on a screen he interacts with from confinement - Each main character is being manipulated by an evil group, and is ultimately aided by the face on the screen who takes his side in the end. - Each has a love he can't be with because it turns out she's dead - Each performs some final act of communication (destroying the jamming tower in Moon, sending the text to Goodwin in Source Code) to disrupt the evil group before departing in the end. - Each main character dies, but it's okay because his replicas live on. - Probably a ton more that I don't feel like typing.</li></ul><br/><br/>BR"

The audience is inducted into the main storyline very quickly as Colter dies after 8 minutes since he woke up and ends up with some memory loss in a surprising turn of events.<br/><br/>The first few minutes are intense and intriguing enough for you to want more. And more is exactly what you get. Except it's only the same. but still, it's more.

Over the course of the movie, we find Stevens desperately trying to figure out the what's, who's and why's of his mission while ""when"" is all that he knows.

Parallels have been drawn with 'inception' by some reviews before me but I think they are exaggerated 'Source code' is a good watch but doesn't possess the heart thumping edge of your seat suspense that we got from Nolan's masterpiece.<br/><br/>You must watch this movie because I was particularly caught by surprise by one sad twist in the tale that I am sure will find interesting too.<br/><br/>I'd say seven stars for great acting and some really fine dialogue."
"eorenmh","8","1","3","7 April 2011"," very interesting and unique as far as i know
","Wow, this movie just blew me up! The pace is smooth and i find it perfectly to my viewing comfort. The plot itself reminded me of classic ""time loop"" stories. It's when you found yourself on an infinite loop of life and Reliving its events Usually it's a day, but on this movie it's like 8 minutes long. Gylenhall's character is connected with 8 minute last experience of a Sean, one of train bomb victims. That experience is called ""source code"", some kind of virtual reality stuff that allowed him to relive Sean's life. Interestingly, he could also acts by his own will, and that's when the inventor of source code said that all events caused by him is only occurred on source code itself.<br/><br/>Actually i wanna give it a ten. But a particular acting from one of the actors is kinda made my viewing experience becomes unpleasant.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spoil more than this. Just enjoy watching it. It wouldn't make you think hard. (sorry for my bad English ,it's not my native language)"
"adamalderton","8","1","3","7 April 2011"," Gyllenhaal's best film? Yes
","Some movies have obscure plot lines, that are more easily understood on a visual platform rather than writing. But writing is all I've got, so here goes nothing.<br/><br/>In the film, Source Code, Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train headed for Chicago, with no idea how he got there. He starts talking to people on the train to try and figure what is happening but an explosion destroys the train and everyone aboard. Stevens then awakes in a chamber, unsure of where he is or what went on while he was on the train. A small screen in front of him shows a woman trying to give him instruction. Stevens discovers that a bomb has been planted on the train and he needs to find out who has done it, in order to stop a bigger catastrophe. He is continually sent back to the train with an 8 minute time frame to shut down the bomb and discover who has planted it. (Think the style of Groundhog Day).<br/><br/>Confused? Doesn't matter. Source Code is worth the blurred storyline. You have to see this one for yourself to get a full grasp of what is happening. If you're worried you'll leave this one in a daze and unsure of what you just saw, put the worries aside. The dots get connected as the movie moves forward with an accelerating pace that never lets off the gas pedal. Gyllenhaal brings an outstanding performance to this sci-fi thriller. Amidst all the action, he doesn't let us forget about the human element, which brings Source Code to life."
"Chilosopher","6","1","3","7 April 2011"," A moderately entertaining sci-fi thriller that slowly unravels under an absurd plot
","NOTE: This review contains basic spoilers, but no plot specifics beyond the first 30 minutes. I discuss the ending in a very general way and only in the last three paragraphs.<br/><br/>After watching Moon, I had relatively high expectations for Source Code. The film's premise is fairly preposterous, but I was willing to give it a chance because of the video game-like idea of re-living a short period of time over and over. The general concept had been mined before to great comedic success in Groundhog Day, but is well-suited for an action/sci-fi/thriller.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that a terrorist has bombed a commuter train outside Chicago, killing hundreds. The military believes that the bomber plans to kill millions more. To avert disaster, they utilize a mysterious invention called the ""Source Code."" The logic behind the Source Code system is where the movie gets a little too ambitious (or lazy, depending on your view) with its pseudo-scientific justifications. Suffice it to say that this invention allows handsome Army Captain Colter Stevens (played with convincing bewilderment by Jake Gyllenhaal) to essentially take the place of a passenger on the bombed train right before the explosion. Stevens must relive the last eight minutes before the bombing again and again until he can find the bomb and the terrorist's identity.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal pulls off an effective and dynamic performance, especially given the inherently repetitive nature of the plot. His initial confusion is a useful device to ease viewers into the film's intentionally mysterious circumstances, while also driving the suspense of wanting to know what the hell is REALLY happening. His growing comfort with the ""virtual"" nature of the Source Code provides a surprisingly hefty dose of comic relief and a few subtle philosophical observations. The lovely Michelle Monaghan, who plays a fellow passenger, makes the most of limited dialogue and action. As with her roles in many other loud, chaotic action movies, she almost effortlessly imbues her character with some much-needed empathy. Her chemistry with Gyllenhaal grounds the otherwise ridiculous events occurring around them and provides the only real heart of the story. <br/><br/>Vera Farmiga is decent as Captain Stevens' supervisor, whose cold-hearted dedication to the mission masks a more sympathetic side. The only real acting complaint I had was with Jeffrey Wright, who kicked ass in the Bond reboots, but here unravels into an odd, mad scientist caricature complete with menacingly drawn out speech.<br/><br/>The cinematography is pretty, and often striking, especially when depicting the many, many explosions that occur as well as in the more intimate settings of Stevens' isolated world. The pacing is very good, alternating between the game-like experimentation within the Source Code and the steady drip of plot details that occurs outside in the still mysterious real world. This alternation gives the film a smart, purposeful personality in the first third, but begins to sag in the second act as we learn more and more about the absurd nature of the Source Code and Stevens' predicament. Still, the well-developed suspense keeps you hanging on despite the mounting plot holes. Unfortunately, the momentum comes screeching to a halt with a painfully excessive ending and epilogue in the last 20 minutes or so that seems more intent with each passing scene on erasing the pleasant memories of everything that came before it. <br/><br/>Now here's the thing with sci-fi movies that depend entirely on a nonexistent technology. No one thinks that the technical explanations must be 100% accurate and consistent with all known scientific facts; this is still fantasy, after all. Without a little creative license, we'd get stuck only watching boring NOVA documentaries. However, the technology's nature must at least reflect a reasonable extrapolation from current scientific knowledge and engineering. Thus, I can buy a ""dream-sharing"" machine in Inception, since dreams are essentially electrical signals which can theoretically be networked. It also helps when this technology is left purposely ambiguous. With Source Code, however, the writers simply work their magic device into a technical and conceptual corner that the film never quite breaks out of.<br/><br/>The main problem with the writing here is that the film establishes the nature of the Source Code as one fairly graspable concept (inhabiting someone's ""memories"" through a computer simulation). Then, the third act (in a desire to include a brilliant ""twist"" that will get people talking, no doubt) flips this concept around, turning our interpretation of the film's events into an arguably more intriguing perspective. However, almost NONE of the monumental implications of this twist are even explored; there simply isn't time. Instead, we're given a pat, sentimental ending that seems more like a cop-out than a brilliant resolution. Perhaps more frustrating is that the ""twist"" makes absolutely no scientific sense given the stated mechanics of the Source Code. <br/><br/>If the film had ended maybe ten minutes earlier, I think Source Code could have deserved a 7. Instead, the haphazard ending combined with the increasingly ridiculous techno-voodoo significantly killed my enthusiasm for this otherwise well-crafted story. ""But how can an ending erase the quality of everything that came before it?"" you might ask. Because the film never bothers to explore the implications of its twist from the beginning. If you rewatch The Sixth Sense knowing the twist, there's a whole other level of enjoyment to be gleaned from seeing how previously unnoticed details fit into the new framework. In Source Code, we are instead given a series of vignettes that toy around with the idea of ""re-doing"" certain events, without any cohesive discussion of the ultimately much grander (not to mention more morally troubling) nature of the Source Code. Not only is this wasted potential in a creative sense, but the film lacks a coherent message as a result.<br/><br/>Overall, Source Code is an enjoyable thriller, a decent action movie,and mediocre science fiction. See it if you're craving some reality-skewing escapism, but you might want to consider leaving the theater a little early."
"moviemania513","9","1","3","6 April 2011"," great movie, really makes you think
","""Source Code"" is a 2011 sci-fi thriller film directed by Duncan Jones and starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. Captain Colter Stephens (Gyllenhaal) has a mission, and that mission is to find the one who placed a bomb on a Chicago train and has only 8 minutes to do so! As time goes on, Stephens finds himself in a race against time situation! This film reminds me a lot of ""Inception"", it's one of those that really makes you think. It's also one you might have to see more than once. I thought the plot was excellent and the film shot very well with special effects all around. Anyone who is in the mood for a creative action-packed thriller should go see this."
"skatiehall","9","1","3","6 April 2011"," Definitely was not expecting that!
","When I saw the first trailer for Source Code here on IMDb, I nearly flipped out because it stars one of my favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal. As I continued to watch it, I saw the 8-star rating and that Michelle Monaghan, whom I loved in Eagle Eye, plays the leading lady, and I decided that somehow I was going to see this movie. I finally got the chance today when my family and I traveled to our nearest theater and saw this film for a very discounted rate, and I could not have been more pleased!<br/><br/>Source Code is about Captain Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot for the US Air Force, who wakes confused to find himself on a train and sitting across from a woman he does not know talking to him. Eight minutes later, a bomb detonates on the train and everyone, including Captain Stevens and the woman, is killed. As the film progresses, Captain Stevens learns that he is a part of a program called the Source Code, a computer program that places him in the body of Sean Fentress, which the Air Force, by finding the train's bomb and bomber, is using to prevent another bombing of Chicago that will occur later that day.<br/><br/>I sat on the edge of my seat through the entire movie, awaiting Captain Stevens' fate as thousands of questions flooded my mind: Why him? Will he find the bomber? I even, for a second, believed that either Captain Stevens or Christina (the woman) was the bomber. I came out of the movie with more questions than I did after watching The Matrix, but after sifting through every lobe of my brain for about twenty minutes, I came to my own conclusions and deemed the movie worthy of watching multiple times over. The plot kept me praying for that happy ending I hoped was coming, and the characters and subplots had me laughing, tearing up, and becoming immersed. The twist completed the film, and the ending (which fueled most of my questions) had me itching for more. Anyone who is willing to pay attention and wrack their brain for an hour and a half would love this film, as I did. Had I not come out so utterly confused, I would have given it a ten!"
"cosmorados","8","1","3","6 April 2011"," Aaaagh! It's in my head!
","Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on a train next to an attractive woman he seems to know relatively well, apart from the fact that she keeps calling him Sean, what's with that? Oh and he doesn't know who he is or how he got there, and after a mere 8 minutes he is ripped apart along with every other passenger on the train by a huge explosion. He then ""Wakes up"" in some kind of capsule to be told he is part of a test operation called Beleaguered Castle and what he has experienced is reality inside what's called the source code and is reliving the last 8 minutes of life of some other poor soul who was killed on the train. His mission, find and identify the bomber.<br/><br/>And that's it. Owing more to the Matrix than inception the writer, Ben Ripley, and Director, Duncan Jones have crafted an almost top-drawer thriller that stays with you long after you've left the cinema. Unlike some of the other semi-recent disaster/thriller's I have seen, namely ""Knowing"" and ""The Adjustment Bureau"" the problems that both those films had was the reliance of some kind of benevolent alien/god type figures controlling everyone's lives. This film sweetly side-steps that pitfall and so were just left to enjoy the tense tale of this man's last eight minutes on earth. The direction is tense, claustrophobic at times but, like Jones' previous effort, ""Moon"", it's the humanity at the heart of it that pulls us in.<br/><br/>Credit to Gyllanhall (Is that spelt right?) for giving yet another interesting performance but also credit due for me to Vera Farmiga who as his superior gives a performance that in a way everything hinges on. In many ways she is the unsung hero of this film and she, probably more than the cute looking Monaghan is really the second co-star. Everyone else does there job well, but the best thing about this film is that I found it stayed with me long after I'd seen it and was filled with a need to watch is again.<br/><br/>Could have been standard predictable fare, but left me asking more questions at the end of it. Always a good thing."
"freemantle_uk","9","1","3","6 April 2011"," A really good sci-fi thriller
","Despite only making two films, Duncan Jones is seen as one of the great new directors around, for good reason. Having made the subtle, intelligence sci-fi film Moon that only had one actor throughout he has moved onto making a bigger budget, but still complex film.<br/><br/>Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall), a army helicopter pilot awakes on a train and unaware about what is going on. A young woman, Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who speaks to him as her friend, Shaun. After the train explores Stevens discovers that the train was blown up by a bomb and the people who run the Source Code project, Captain Collen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), tell him he can go back to last eight minutes of a person's live and that he has to discover who bombed the train before a dirty bomb goes off in Chicago. But every time he goes back to the event Stevens becomes closer to Christina and Stevens goes on to his own personal mission to save her and discover what happened to him in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>The big risk for Source Code was that it would end up being like Vantage Point, a film repeating the same event over and over again and becoming a very boring film. Luckily Jones did not fall into this trap and he made a film that is intense mystery, events that change and made sure that Source Code was filled with twists and turns. Many elements were similar to Moon in how the film unfounded and moral arguments it created. Whilst Moon avoided CGI as much as possible, Jones was more comfortable using special effects, whether for the explosion or Stevens entering the Source Code. When Stevens entered the Source Code it reminded me of the Assassin's Code with the white and blue imagines and it has a similar concept of going back in time using another person's body discovering something to change the present. The science behind Source Code, that everyone who dies lives an electric imprint of eight minutes so therefore a person's conscious can be put into it is ridiculous, but Jones made the film so well that you can easily ignore it.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent in Source Code, Jones does have a eye for casting and he brought in a cast of indie darlings. Of course Gyllenhall is a great actor and had great chemistry with Monaghan; both were confidence in their roles. Monaghan is the innocent eyes on everything and despite having to play the same events over and over she is able make out she is confused by why her friend's behaviour has changed. I personally love Farmiga for her roles in The Departed and Up in the Air and again she is able to mix both a strong confidence and someone is more nicer and compassionate. Her character starts off as someone is cold and hard but slowly soften as her character develops. Wright is very much in an antagonist role and is very solid playing the director of the Source Code operation.<br/><br/>Source Code is a film that has a lot of ideas behind it, particularly about fate and destiny and if someone change the future. Stevens knows the events that coming but has to take matters into his own hands. Stevens not just wants to stop the dirty bomb but he was to save the passengers on the train and particular Christina. Stevens wants his own free will and make his own choices. There is also the moral argument about whether should want to live on after death, whether it would have negative affects or whether death is better then just being a pawn. (SPOILER ALERT) Source Code also rises a time paradox when Stevens in his final journey into the Source Code he is able to stop the bombing and the dirty bomb and therefore never needed to back in time in the first part. There is also a moral problem that Stevens survives in Shaun's body and lives, but happened to Shaun's consciousness. It still debate to what happened to John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich. (SPOILER OVER).<br/><br/>I do wish that Jones was a little harder when it came to violence and language and gone for the full R/15 rating, but that is mainly because I had to sit need a couple of annoying school kids. One of them said ""I'm confused"" and I thought to myself ""because you are an idiot"".<br/><br/>Source Code is a more mainstream effort compared to Moon, but it is just as clever. Hopefully we will get to see even more from Jones."
"Jerique","8","1","3","6 April 2011"," Not the best of the year...so far...
","As my first film of 2011, Source Code ended up being as good as expected. It is not supposed to be a time-travel film. But, it plays like it at first. However, the difference between this movie and Back to the Future is that this movie has rules to explain whereas Back to the Future doesn't really.<br/><br/>It opens already into the story which seems placed in present time, where Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on a train to Chicago as passenger Sean Fentress. He soon after dies after a bomb on the train kills everyone on board, and wakes up in a capsule looking at a screen of Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). She tells him what is supposed to do during his time using the program Source Code which is to find the bomber before the next destructive plan goes through.<br/><br/>I liked the film's somewhat repetitive style that reminds me of Vantage Point, and although I've never seen Quantum Leap, I have a feeling this film was using a similar storyline from another film. It's a fresh thriller and I liked the way the story gradually plays out. It's not very hard to guess the predictable culprit in the small cast.<br/><br/>My one problem with the film is how they establish rules and tell the audience (and Colter Stevens) that it's a program that uses memory and doesn't have the ability to alter reality nor time-travel, but then Colter Stevens figures out how to do exactly that in the end. It annoys me to know end if you establish rules for your movie, and then break them. It doesn't necessarily ruin the movie, but it makes it lose credibility.<br/><br/>It won't be the best film of the year, but it might be one of the top ten for me when the year is over."
"TheDarkKnight21","9","1","3","4 April 2011"," Science Fantasy Bests Science Fiction
","Source Code is a fantastic movie, a smart thriller that gives you a satisfying and humane story and lead character. Weirdly, such a great film is being classified in the wrong genre. Nearly everyone is call it science fiction, leading the film's critics to call Source Code's science ""stupid"" and ""nonsensical"". But Source Code was not trying to describe the intricate mechanics of time travel the way films like ""Primer"" and ""Donnie Darko"" have explored. Rather, Duncan Jones was using time travel as a simple plot device to tell an emotionally-driven story.<br/><br/>Now, the explanation for how the Source Code works is quickly described by Dr. Rutledge and is overtly simple. He just says that they created a machine through ""quantum physics and parabolic calculus"" that can witness time rather than travel through time. That is pretty much the extent of the ""science"" you get in this so-called science fiction movie. When you start to think about it, it really doesn't make much sense. But, Duncan Jones wasn't trying to show explain how time travel works, which is to put it simply, a foolhardy effort. What makes this film great, is Colter Stevens' emotional journey aboard the Source Code.<br/><br/>The film is very well paced, especially for a film as short as 93 minutes. The dialog flows and makes sense, especially when Colter has relived the crisis a few times and is able to make dead-on predictions on what will happen. In light of the heaviness of the film's looming threat of death and destruction, there's enough comic relief to liven up the situation but not too much for you to be drawn out of the film. The film is also remarkably shot for a film that has a total of four settings. Then there is this spectacular shot of a character tumbling out of a vehicle and you see every thud and bump against the ground that looks very, very real. However, the film's script and direction are only icing to the delicious cake of character development you get in this film. <br/><br/>Colter is a sympathetic man who's caught in a shitty situation. The man was a soldier and has real-life issues to work out with his father. Now all of a sudden he's found himself in a ""Groundhog Day"" scenario of reliving the same horrible moment over and over again just to find clues of the terrorist's identity. You feel for Colter's plight, and Gyllenhaal injects the pathos needed for the audience to care about his character and the subplot involving his father. Mind you, this subplot could have been excised from the film and nothing would be lost to the story, but a whole chunk of Colter's character would have been lost as a result.<br/><br/>What could never be cut from the film would be Colter's relationship with Monaghan's Christina. Christina is the light at the end of this hellish tunnel for Colter. Never mind that Monaghan is drop dead beautiful, she also carries a sincere sense of sweetness and care for Colter, or rather the man Colter has become. And Monaghan shows her acting chops just as well as Gyllenhaal does, so pay attention to this rising star in the future. Farminga's Goodwin is the only person who aids Colter in making sense of this insanity and the veteran actress does her job just as well. <br/><br/>The film only had two minor problems. First was Wright's character, who was a little too much a caricature to be believable. Particularly because he shows zero empathy to Colter's plight makes us detached from him. Granted, it makes us side with Colter more, but Wright had a genuine goal that he could stand by proudly, but the actor does nothing with it. There's really no strong villain as you would expect from a terrorist plot, but I guess that time was cut in favor of developing the strong three leads.<br/><br/>But getting back to my initial discussion of Source Code's genre, the film's ""science"" is laughably stupid and simple. However, it is a ""scientific"" explanation nonetheless for how Colter is able to relive the same moment in time over and over again. And this is what makes this film fall under science fantasy, a genre where the scientific explanation for plot devices are absurdly simple. But what the genre loses in making sense to the scientific community, it makes up for in scores with audiences by telling a compelling story. I've spent a good few paragraphs gushing about how emotionally connecting the characters were and how well the film is paced. Obviously, I wasn't too hung up about the science in the film, because I had so much fun with everything else.<br/><br/>Source Code is a smart and fast-paced thriller that gives you characters you give a snap about, to-the-point dialog, great acting, and a surreal adventure in time loops and parallel universes. Don't be scared by the science, it's satisfying light, and doesn't get in the way of the tense plot of locating a bomber aboard a train. This film has everything that I love in a film, and take you on one hell of a time trotting adventure."
"TheMaskedMovieMan","Null","1","3","2 April 2011"," Source Code - 'or should that be Object Code'
","For a while now, sci-fi has been home to films about faceless alien invasions and empty space battles. ""Why is it so bad?"" I hear you scream. Surely the rich volume of scientific knowledge available (that would be the 'sci' part of the film type) and the ease at which this could be blended into a fictitious event (need I say 'fi') should make the genre an interesting and entertaining library of films. However, where many fail is in the fact that they seem to think that the audience demands special effects and burning cities, in which doing so loses most of a film's charm and half the story, unless you have Will Smith to battle those bad-ass aliens! I guess what I'm trying to get at is that it is the people themselves in the story that provide the best entertainment and emotional connection.<br/><br/>A director who has been able to bring us out of this rut and back towards the light is Duncan Jones. In 2009, he gave us his directorial debut, 'Moon.' A brilliantly eerie look at a a lonely man's life in isolation on a moon base. Now, two years later, 2011, and Jones is back with 'Source Code,' his next film.<br/><br/>Source code opens with Shaun (Jake Gyllenhaal) jolting awake on a busy commuter train heading towards Chicago. He has no idea where he is, or even who he is, with the woman sitting opposite him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan), calling him Shaun, although he doesn't seem to know who Shaun is. He tells her his name is Captain Colter Stevens and that he has no idea who she or Shaun is. Even stranger is that the last Colter/Shaun remembers is that he was on a flying mission in Iraq. Finding himself seemingly trapped within another person's life, Colter barely has enough time to gather his wits before the train explodes, killing everyone on board.<br/><br/>Where Source Code gets far more interesting than just an exploding train is that Colter wakes after the explosion. He isn't dead, instead finding himself confined to a seat inside an isolation chamber, wearing his flight military uniform. Still having no idea what is going on, he is contacted through a television screen by the mission controller, Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga.) It turns out that Colter is part of a science experiment in which he is able to re-live the last eight minutes of someone else's life. The train attack happened previously that morning and using the last eight minutes of Shaun's memory, Colter needs to find out who bombed the train so that they can prevent a future attack.<br/><br/>What follows for the next twenty minutes is Groundhog Day on an exploding train but seemingly different in that each time Colter goes back something is different, leading him to believe he can change the course of events. We learn the parameters of the 'Source Code' technology, where Colter is in fact being contained before each eight- minute burst and more about the passengers on the train. However, where Source Code truly becomes something special is in the second half of the film. A huge plot twist leaves you feeling as if the film has given its best too soon. Although as Jones showed in Moon, even once the true situation is revealed, what happens afterwards is far more intriguing and leaves the story open to pave its own way.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific on all fronts and the shots and dialogue flow without anything feeling clunky, creating a film in which its pace never slacks and its scenes never feel irrelevant or boring. To me, it almost felt like one of those films that could have been filmed in an afternoon, which I see as being a success when it comes down to make up, continuity and tone. <br/><br/>There is a Moon reference that some will appreciate in the form of Christina's mobile ringtone, and a splash of humour throughout prevents those not able to follow the science mumbo-jumbo to still enjoy the show. So, without giving any spoilers away, it is quite hard to examine the rest of the film apart from the ending, as much of a contradiction as those words might seem. This is because I always find that most films seem to get a bit strange towards the end. Either the writers ran out of coffee/money and feel as though things need wrapping up fast or it drags on too long because nobody wants to commit to ending the film on one particular note. However, Source Code, in my opinion, had a great ending in comparison to a lot of films. Not only does it hit on an emotional level but it also demonstrates how involved the viewer has become with the story, which is something that is always hard to achieve, especially in action. The finale is then topped off with a clever and stylish closing scene in which all the answers are in your hands only you get to spend the journey home thinking it through before it all connects. <br/><br/>My only gripe would be with the film title, though it is a bit pedantic. It should be noted that 'Source Code' is the written programming code, whilst 'Object Code' is the compiled output, ready for execution. Though, seriously, would you have ever taken a film called 'Object Code' seriously?<br/><br/>Re-cap: one of the best sci-fi films I've recently seen; ignore your Battle L.As and Skylines, old-school sci-fi is back and expect big things from Duncan Jones in the future.<br/><br/>www.maskedmoveman.blogspot.com"

","You probably know what this movie is about by now, but it's pretty simple premise. A soldier from Afghanistan (Captain Stevens) has his consciousness put into a normal school teacher riding the commute to Chicago on a train. It is his mission to find out who and where the bomber is that blew up the train. The bomber is planning to use another, more powerful, dirty bomb (a bomb loaded with radioactive material) inside Chicago. All they want to do is capture this assailant before the second bomb detonates.<br/><br/>According to the science, it is impossible to stop the first bomb from happening (at least in that universe). Yeah, string theory anyone? While the geniuses in the world will have a field day with alternate realities, as far as the movie is concerned, it works good enough for the normal movie goer.<br/><br/>I'll accept all that, and the inconsistencies, as the movie was excellently shot, very enjoyable (up to a point), and acted quite well. I would recommend seeing this movie for any thriller/disaster types. The characters are well done, and things move at a perfect pace.<br/><br/>Here's where everything went wrong... the ending. Horrible Hollywood ending that makes absolutely no sense at all. If they would have ended the movie at the time stop, when she pulled the plug, it would have been much better. Instead, there is 5 minutes of complete drivel at the end.<br/><br/>My advice when watching this movie? Enjoy it, watch it, and then when the time stop happens near the end, leave. The last 5 minutes isn't even worth it. Again, Hollywood decimates another wonderfully done, and very enjoyable experience."
"Maziun","1","2","10","20 September 2014"," Idiotic movie from beginning to the end
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I didn't liked Duncan's Jones previous movie ""Moon"" which had positive reception , despite my opinion that it was poor man's ""2001 Space odyssey"". This movie is even worse . ""Moon"" at least had good acting , music and art direction. ""Source code"" doesn't have anything to defend itself.<br/><br/>The story obviously has been inspired by movies like Groundhog day"" , 12 monkeys"" , ""Memento"" , Deja vu"" or Inception"". It's hard to find something truly original nowadays , so the lack of originality isn't a sin here. However the fact that Jones managed to create a dull nonsense based on such good movies is something that cannot be left without a comment.<br/><br/>One has to remember that real life Source Code isn't a computer program. In the movie the source code is a computer program which creates a worm hole to plug any consciousness into other similar parallel universes it can locate based on its input data. Here we have all the minds on the train whose last 8 minutes of existence have been recaptured to locate the exact time, place and event that the army wants Gyllenhaal's consciousness to be plugged into.<br/><br/>The problems here start from the beginning. How can you create an entire fully-interactive alternate reality based on somebody's memory ? MEMORY by definition is s something fixed that can't be changed or interacted with. How do you create an alternate reality at all ? Creating alternate realities and being able to recover the last 8 minutes of a dead person's memory are two concepts that have absolutely NOTHING in common. Those are two SEPARATE ideas badly combined together. The plot's ideas are far-fetched and they're not even consistent or logical. It's impossible to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>At one point we learn that ""some part"" of the main character's brain is ""still functioning"". It would be absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to undertake the complex tasks he does with only ""some part"" of his brain. And why the army won't tell Gyllenhaal what's going on ? They send him time after time after time without telling him about the situation ! How he or anybody else in his situation was about to solve the mystery without any information ?! It's not until five Gyllenhaal's failure they decide to tell him about the program , bomb , terrorist , his situation and what they want from him. Jesus , it's like sending a recruit to war without any weapon or training WHY does army and Gyllenhaal think the person detonating the bomb is ON THE TRAIN when it blows up ?! They know about the second attack , so it's obvious that the person responsible couldn't blown himself up. No solid reason is ever given for why his commanders are so incredibly sure the suspect was even on the train ANYWHERE CLOSE to that 8 minute window he keeps visiting to begin with Other issues – Jake Gyllenhaal is an SOLDIER ?! God save America ! The love story between Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan not only is morally wrong , but also completely forced , unbelievable and unnecessary. The terrorist is just one man who was able to CREATE ATOMIC BOMB BY HIMSELF. I know it's possible to create a bomb by yourself, but NOT an atomic bomb (without skills , money or equipment) ! And how do you sent SMS from one universe to other ?! This film is a whodunit and the guilty person in this movie is obvious from the beginning. The question is answered by the first candidate the audience suspects, but the last the protagonist bothers checking. ""Source code"" suffers from being repetitive since Gyllenhaal repeats the same 8 minutes over and over again. The characters are uninteresting and rather dull. The movie doesn't have any heart , despite the lame subplot with hero's father. The acting is terribly bland , special effects mediocre and the dialogs completely forgettable.<br/><br/>What is the meaning of the movie ? That we should appreciate every second of our lives ? that there is a parallel universe to ours ? That we should be nice for each other ? This comes from a ""visionary"" director ?! It's terrible cliché . The ending is lame , totally unconvincing and denies the ""logic"" of the universe Jones created (not that there was any logic in this movie from the beginning) . Terrible movie that pretends to be smart . It's not science fiction , but BULLS*** FICTION. I give it 1/10."

It's not a movie you ponder for days, it's a movie you forget in hours.<br/><br/>It is my fault, since my last 2 viewings were Primer and The machinist (which is a stunning movie if interpreted right), so I had very high expectations....I did think that a 7.5 rating warranted it, but sadly not.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable, the ""time travel"" theories have no real depth, the ending is classic Hollywood, while the real shockers of this movie are the 2 actors. Not going to say which...you figure it out. I mean really shocking. In The machinist I was watching the amazing Christian Bale and in this one I was practically gritting my teeth together because of the acting...<br/><br/>I heard someone comparing this to Inception. Please don't be fooled. Although Inception may be boring for some at some points, this one does not even get close. I mean come on...Inception had Leonardo in it...it's in another league, trust me. <br/><br/>I usually agree with IMDb ratings, but this one really missed it.

","I'd hesitate to use the word ""thriller"" as part of the summary of this movie. That said, it is a decent attempt at mainstreaming science fiction - and casting Gyllenhaal as the lead is sure to bring this movie to more people than it would have reached otherwise.<br/><br/>As someone who loves almost anything science fiction, the premise of this movie is very interesting. The ""source code"" has been created so that Gyllenhaal can inhabit another man's body, sort-of go back in time and figure out where the bomb is and who planted it - in eight minutes. But the catch is that the bomb has already exploded and everyone is already dead. Small revelations throughout the movie keep you just interested enough to get to the end and keep from feeling bored as Gyllenhaal repeatedly goes back to try and figure everything out. The problem with this movie is that Hollywood doesn't understand that science fiction doesn't need the fluffy, mushy endings. The climax of the movie felt silly and anti-climatic. Just when you think the movie is over and Hollywood has their perfect ending they make it even more Hollywood instead of just letting it be. Overall, a good science fiction-lite movie with an easy-on-the-eyes cast.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I'd pay $2 at the cheap theater for this one."

","Take a dash of ""The Matrix"" and ""The 13th Floor,"" add a smidgen of ""Sphere,"" ""Donnie Darko"" ""Frequency"" and ""Paycheck"" and, voila, you have ""Source Code"". Jake Gyllenhaal plays ""Colter Stevens,"" an Army helicopter pilot whose last memories are flying sorties in Afghanistan, but suddenly finds himself in the body of a schoolteacher on board a double-decker commuter train speeding toward Chicago. Sitting opposite him is ""Christina Warren"" (Michelle Monaghan), a friend the schoolteacher has known for a couple of months. Eight minutes pass with no significant incidents, when suddenly the train explodes, incinerating everyone on board. Colter Stevens then himself strapped inside a pod, his only outside communication a webcam connecting to Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), who tells Colter the train was bombed earlier in the day by a terrorist and that, using his acute powers of observation, Colter must discover the identity of the bomber to prevent an even worse disaster. Colter not only takes on this mission for himself, he determines to discover the nature of what happened between his mission in Afghanistan and his current presence inside the pod.<br/><br/>To reveal more would spoil the film. Let us just say it has a lot to do with the nature of ""reality"" as it pertains to quantum physics and Jewish Khaballah, that moment-to-moment reality is determined by consciousness.<br/><br/>This is a ""small"" movie with big ideas. Like ""Groundhog Day,"" Colter keeps relieving the same experiences, expanding the possible outcomes in order to accomplish his mission. Production values are superb and the small supporting cast is professional, bringing just the right nuances to thinly written characters to make them believable. Gyllenhaal and Monaghan have great chemistry, thankfully, as they have little time to establish their relationship, due to both the repetitive nature of their scenes and their time apart in order to produce the necessary variances in the 8 minute segments.<br/><br/>Many, especially those bound in causality and linear thinking, will find themselves baffled by this movie, particularly the ending. No, this isn't really about ""parallel universes"" or ""time travel,"" it is about the nature of consciousness as it relates to quantum probabilities. All life is lessons and the ""reality"" we see depends upon the lessons we need to learn. We truly are ""a thought in the mind of God"" and our fate can be changed from instant to instant. That is the lesson of ""Source Code"" and that lesson alone is worth a ""10,"" in my book, anyway."

","The merit of this movie is the idea - quite brilliant. Acting is fine, mostly because the actors are all reasonably good-looking. My low score is perhaps due to my low tolerance for explosions, crashes, and unnecessary noise. In this particular movie, the same crash happens over and over again in all the sauces. There was a time when special effects and conflagrations impressed audiences very easily. In the 21st century, however, we have the technology to produce our own explosions on our own laptops, that is, if we really care to live with images of things blowing up on a regular basis. The repetition of the explosion in this movie is essential to the story, but the dialog is completely unnecessary at times. The main protagonist's anxiety about his mission is crucial to our appreciation of the film, but the whole business could have been compressed in about 25 minutes. I cannot spare you the trite feeling: who is going to give me these couple hours back?"
"galahad58-1","5","1","4","19 August 2011"," Code Dumb
","Science Fiction movies usually try to keep some sort of ""possibility"" within their story lines. We know that you cannot travel through time, but the theory may one day be put to use and warping through time and space may be a reality. Source Code indicates that when someone dies you can still see their last eight minutes. Interesting concept. The problem is that no matter what they try to say--once you are dead that implanted memory will never ever ever change. So this movie has someone go into a dead persons memory, but the dialog changes and the events change. Could never happen. Plus, it becomes an entire world and he leaves the area the deceased was in--where that could never be since the imprinted memory would not open the entire world to someone who enters. The movie is beyond dumb with an idiotic idea. Even if you suspend reality, science, intelligence--the ending is one of the worse I have ever seen. Not recommended."

The heroine repeats the same dialogue again and again when Jake enters the source code to find the bomber. No comedy and not as much as expected action too.. There are scenes where u cant imagine would ever happen.. Like for example in the end when they show parallel reality which is totally impossible.

","Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gylenhaal) wakes up in a Chicago train, not knowing anyone around him, even the pretty girl (Michelle Monaghan) in front of him who seems to know him. After a few minutes, we are all shocked when this train blows up into flames! Cut to the next scene where we see Capt. Stevens in a cramped little capsule speaking to a controller (Vera Farmiga) on a TV monitor. Then we see the incredible mission that Capt. Stevens was actually on, and from there, we the audience gets a smart, thrilling, dramatic and romantic ride all the way to the end.<br/><br/>OK, at the start, the film was very repetitive (ala ""Groundhog Day""). However when the film hits its drift, it doesn't let up. The science fiction aspect is unbelievable, but they make it actually sound plausible. Jake Gylenhaal does it again in creating a character you will definitely root for to complete his unprecedented mission. Stevens' touching phone call towards the end is an acting highlight. The final ten minutes still manages to spin the film around, which can be good or bad depending on the person watching. Thinking about the fate of Vera Farmiga's character can give rise to a lot of plot questions.<br/><br/>When I first saw the poster of ""Source Code,"" it did not make me want to see it. It looked like just another generic explosive summer action film. The title sounded very lame as well. However, when it debuted in theaters last week, the reviews were consistently very good.

"cadillac20","8","1","4","1 April 2011"," Surprisingly Effective and Emotional Film
","When I first saw trailers for Source Code, it didn't come off as anything noteworthy. It looked decent enough, and it's from Duncan Jones, the guy who gave us the fantastic Moon. But the concept seemed a little been-there, done-that. The thrills seemed like they could be light and even a bit dull. But, color me surprised to report that this is an unexpected film that does both the thrills and emotions right. Much like Moon, Jones manages to package this film with both a fascinating story and a very relatable and human protagonist.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough: Capt. Colter Stevens has just awoken on a train in someone else's body. He soon comes to learn that he must find out the identity of a terrorist bomber before a devastating attack is to take place. He only has 8 minutes to do so. With this plot, it could have been simple enough to create a thriller that chucks the humanity out the window. However, Jones does a great job of doing just the opposite. Jake Gyllenhaal very successfully injects a great deal of sympathy into his character and makes him relatable. Going beyond typical thriller trappings, the story does its job of digging deep down to find it's heart. In doing so, it balances the many thrilling moments with the more heartfelt ones, whether they be depressing or joyful ones. Even the going back and forth between train and pod is kept to a minimum, making it far more interesting.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that there aren't faults. The film let's it's big secrets out too early, and this in a sense makes the consequences of our character seem less thrilling. At one point long before the end, you just kind of wait for the ending to come. The story about thwarting the bombing also seems to lose tension as it goes on, in part because of the lackluster villain at the center of it and how secondary it's handled. The ending certainly makes up for it by being very unexpected and focusing on the more important things. Nonetheless, a lot of tension is lost because of the lack of focus on the bombing aspects. <br/><br/>Overall, Source Code is an unexpected thriller. These days, action thrillers all too commonly forget about the human qualities of their story. But, in Jones hands, he puts that heart right in. By the end of the film, you will have a smile on your face, reminded of just how enjoyable a film with an emotional punch can be."

""I know not,"" said the second Shape,<br/><br/>""I only died last night.""<br/><br/>Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Identity<br/><br/>Be it from aborigines or astrophysicists, alternative-universe theories intrigue me. Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself not in Afghanistan, where he was just flying helicopter missions but as a civilian on a train going to Chicago. Although the beauty opposite him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan), knows him as someone else, he does not know her or anyone else on the train.<br/><br/>Source Code is a sci-fi with a brain, perhaps not as intriguing to as The Assignment Bureau, but engaging nonetheless because like that study of free will, Source Code also dabbles in physics and metaphysics just long enough to make us believe that a character like the Captain can be part of a simulation project that sends him back to 8 minutes on that train in order to find its bomber to stop subsequent sabotage.<br/><br/>Director Duncan Jones opens with music and shots of Chicago and the train moving toward it as Hitchcock might have, or did in a similar way in the opening North by Northwest, with the train coming later. The suspense reminds me also of Hitch as it hovers around identity, or loss thereof, and greater consequences than just for ordinary mistaken identity. <br/><br/>Colter falling for Christina is not a stretch anymore than Cary Grant falling for Eva Marie Saint or Mark Damon for Emily Blunt, charming women all. As in Adjustment, the growing romance helps in the reality department where the metaphysics seems unbelievable.<br/><br/>At this time of year, a dead zone for movies in the first four months, it's comforting to have brainy movies to relax with. Come to think of it, Liam Neeson's Unknown, while not sci-fi, is concerned with the loss of identity as in Source Code. All three movies move quickly, all ask a certain amount of disbelief suspension for the holes in the plot, and all have romances believable while forgivably clichéd."
"candyapplegrey","2","1","5","5 March 2013"," Pointless
","This film is like a long version of Craig David's 'Seven Days' video, without the humour, the music and Craig's smile. Painfully slow and mind-numbingly dull, with a daft, ill-thought-out premise that doesn't quite hold water, it's billed as a futuristic thriller although it's about as thrilling as watching paint dry. Neither is it particularly dramatic so it's hard to know how to categorise it. It's another poor career move by Jake Gyllenhaal after the dreadful Prince of Persia, which, with its confusion of accents and the wooden Gemma Arterton, not to mention the hackneyed concept of an antagonistic couple forced to spend time together, was about as believable as a Carry On movie. The female leads in this have little to do. Although time is supposed to be of the essence in the plot, the cast and crew are happy to waste ours and theirs on this pointless drivel."

","I like sci-fi, but it has to make sense in its own 'made-up reality' way.

You don't know if you're coming or going. The film is all over the place, broken chain of causation, contradictory events with no explanation, bits coming out of left field with no prior build up: messy, messy, messy .In other respects, the film is reminiscent of a dreamy ground hog day experience with lots of thrills and knuckle-biting action thrown in. What it could have done without though, was the hurried romance thread which seems to have been added as an afterthought."
"bob the moo","Null","1","5","24 July 2011"," Has its wobbles but is engaging and entertaining right up to a slightly disappointing ending (SPOILERS)
","Quite often concept films don't quite live up to their potential. Films that have a great concept at their core but yet cannot make that one idea into a fully functioning film. Setting aside a few stutters, Source Code is not one of those films as it draws the viewer in with threads that engage in the present and also the past. The plot is relatively simple – a soldier in a test programme gets to relive the final 8 minutes of someone else's life as many times as he wishes; these 8 minutes end with a terrorist attack on a train and, while he cannot do anything to save those on the train, he can use that time to identify the bomber so that he can be caught in the present.<br/><br/>Source Code is clever and yet also simple at the same time. Like a lot of good sci-fi it is build on ideas but doesn't forget the people. While on the train it manages to deliver tension and a palatable sense of a race against time as Stevens battles his confusion and desire to save the train, in theory the restricted place and time should get repetitive but it builds in enough in the present to inform and vary the past and make it slicker, more engaging and, of course, has less carrying to do in terms of the whole movie. The linkage to the present is good and the plot unfolds there well in a way that also got me to care about what was going on with the characters. Both aspects move along very well and it becomes clear that, while director Jones may seem to like a good idea, he also knows how to direct action.<br/><br/>The final ending seemed like a little bit of a cop-out. There was a sense of emotional buy-in for me in the train and I felt the final scene or two took away from it – it was not that I didn't get the idea that each jump into the source code doesn't just relive the reality, but actually allows for another reality to be created. I won't say it makes any sense, but I understand what the film did with it. Problem for me was not the understanding so much as it was the feeling; regardless of your interpretation of the ending, it ultimately seems to be there to give a positive ending in regards the main characters whereas a much stronger ending would have been his wish being fulfilled (death) and leave it at that. It did sour the movie for me a little bit and it felt like one of those endings that a test audience came up with (even though it isn't).<br/><br/>A large part of it working is Gyllenhaal. He is a great presence in this film and he made me interested in him in all the scenes, whether he was coming to terms with the reality of his situation, or racing around the train – he got his character and it made it easy for me to care. Outside of him the support cast are a little bit secondary but are still good. Monaghan, Farmiga, Wright are all solid and interact with him well, but Gyllenhaal is the star of the show here no doubt.<br/><br/>Source Code may have a few wobbles and appear to bottle it when it comes to delivering the logical but downbeat conclusion the film deserved, but it is still a very good film. The concept is well laid out and the details aren't allowed to bog the action down – action, which is complimented by the characters being good and thus getting me to buy into them and their story. It has room for improvement, but Source Code is still an engaging and enjoyable sci-fi that remembers that it is about people, not the science."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie) was the writer/director for a terrific 2009 film called ""Moon"" (highly recommended). Here he stays in the sci-fi realm with a thrilling and brainy script from Ben Ripley. The best, most accessible sci-fi films not only don't require the viewer to hold a Ph.d, but they also don't talk down to us. This is a fast-moving script with a smart (though a bit preposterous) premise, and plenty of reality to keep us glued to the screen ... and hanging on every word spoken.<br/><br/>It's impossible to write much about the film and not give away some of the stuff that makes it fun, so I will be very brief. Trying to figure out what's happening, how it's happening, and whether they can stop it from happening again ... well, that's just about all a movie lover can hope for! So I won't give away any more than what the trailer sets up.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens and he is involved in a remarkable project that allows ""time travel"" to a parallel universe so that a military contractor can discover the terrorist who bombed a train. The first time he wakes up on the train across from Christina (Michelle Monaghan) he has no idea who she is or where he is. 8 minutes later he is face to face with Captain Goodwin's face (Vera Farmiga) on a monitor and her voice telling him to calm down. Her boss (Jeffrey Wright) is some type of ambitious genius trying to make a name and a buck for himself.<br/><br/>The story evolves by Gyllenhaal being sent back and forth between ""then and now"" on numerous occasions with the mission of uncovering the identity of the bomber. Of course, Gyllenhaal is a good soldier and wants to go above and beyond the call of duty. That's where the film gets tricky and brilliant.<br/><br/>Director Jones works wonders with the camera and we are treated to some fascinating images - both large (Chicago) and small (Gyllenhaal in a train restroom). Great stuff here. That's about all I will say on this one. It should be obvious how much I like it. Also, a fun note ... the phone voice of Gyllenhall's father is that of Scott Bakula, who is known for his role in the TV series ""Quantum Leap"", also a time travel premise."

Most movies I am looking at my watch 3/4 way through, but not with this movie. I was wanting more. There were some unanswered questions, but for the most part I was okay with that because with this kind of storyline I would think it was impossible to fill all the gaps. I thought the ending was good and wasn't left open like some movies do today hoping for the numbers to bring back a sequel. If you want to see a good thriller and a movie that has a good plot then see this...I don't think you will regret it."
"blacklist-1","9","1","5","1 April 2011"," Another terrific sci-fi thriller that more than lives up to the hype.
","The years 2009 and 2011 in the film world have one thing in common and that is a superb year for the science fiction genre. In 2009 there were three, District 9, Star Trek and the very underrated Surrogates. This year so far there have been two, Limitless and now Source Code. When I first heard about this film I was taken aback by the high IMDb rating of an 8.1 and on the statistics most people were rating this a nine or a ten. Well I'm pleased to say the hype has been more than justified and this is almost as brilliant as Limitless.<br/><br/>Without going into a synopsis as other reviewers will undoubtedly do anyway, the idea of alternate realities (Quantum theory) and going back to a point in time, more specifically for eight minutes is an interesting premise (all this due to the programme Source Code). It explores the premise to some extent, but where this film mainly succeeds is not in the science, (which was a bit confusing and not entirely credible) is in fact the acting and the characters, Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens gives a great performance and is always convincing throughout the movie. Michelle Monaghan as Cristina Warren I think was a bit underwritten but she humanises the whole movie with a touching, charming and believable performance and is the movies biggest asset. Gyllenhaal and Monaghan in their roles because of their believable performances makes you emotionally connect with them as characters and come to care about what happens to them as they also have a lovely chemistry on screen. <br/><br/>They are helped by a script which was well written and sharp. I was also taken with the cinematography of the ""source code"" universe, which was beautiful to look at, the special effects were also superb as well. There was plenty of suspense and tension throughout as well and it kept me watching to the end. Speaking of the end I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong your glad for Cristina and Colter and I am all for happy endings, but it just felt conveniently added on to me and there was no explanation at all of how it came to be as it was with the simulation of only eight minutes becoming a reality universe. So you are left with a big question, which ultimately left me feeling a bit incomplete. <br/><br/>Saying that Source Code more than entertained me and it's nice to see a sci-fi movie that dosen't just care about the action but the characters as well, which gives it heart. Definitely worth going to see."

","Another film by Duncan Jones...... Let me re-phrase that - another first-rate classic from Duncan Jones.<br/><br/>A man awakens in disarray and cannot understand what is happening, a good-looking woman talking to him - she calls him Sean, he corrects her, stating his name is Air Force Captain Colter Stevens....from there his mission starts, although he discovers more once the train explodes and he is drawn, via quantum mechanics and parabolic arcs, back into the future, namely later that day. There he is ensconced in a metal all-surrounding cell with a face on a screen issuing instructions (Captain Goodwin) - before being sent back to 7.40am that morning!<br/><br/>Confusing? No, the story opens itself relatively easily and progresses at a fast pace, taking the viewer along the same path as Captain Stevens, taking the woman (Christina Warren) along with him in a vain effort to save her whilst trying to succeed in stopping that days disaster.<br/><br/>The photography is stunning, showing a city and its environs, transportation links and countryside in clean, crisp images, offset by the dark, crowded, cramped, almost dingy interior of the Source Code Headquarters.<br/><br/>I smiled at the ring tone of Christina's phone - I guess Duncan Jones has a thing about that song; I am sure Mr Hawks will be smiling too!<br/><br/>Twists and turns occur, misleading the viewer into a thought process, before veering into another, during another eight minute intrusion into the past. <br/><br/>All in all the satisfaction felt comes from figuring out as Captain Stevens does what the inventor of Source Code (Dr. Rutledge) cannot know. <br/><br/>The end is a perfect conclusion to a great film. Thoroughly recommended and worth every point of ten out of ten. I sense greater things for Duncan Jones and look forward eagerly to watching his career unfold. Please let every film be as good if not better...."

","I would consider this one of the most overrated movies on IMDb. The characters are without exception shallow to the point of annoyance, and the story holds little to no surprises. The main potential in the story would have been an interesting variety of approaches how to solve the task of unmasking the bomber. Instead we the main character repeatedly engaging in unpromising and uncreative methods and bad acting. Jake Gyllenhaal looks all cute as usual, it's not for a minute that anyone beside an infatuated teenager could take him seriously in the role of Iraqi war veteran. Even amongst recent movies there are examples which deal with time travel and parallel realities in a both more precise (Looper) or ironic and amusing way (Edge of Tomorrow)."
"vostf","5","1","6","20 November 2013"," A bit patchy, feels like a nice B-movie
","First things first I eventually watched Source Code after avoiding it on release for its nerdish title. Source Code is a vague concept and I would never think of it as an attractive or even intriguing title. But yes, to me source code is about computer science so it has a very mundane meaning, and this makes me think of Matrix, which is also about some Reality Source Code, but with a cleverer - indirect, evocative - title.<br/><br/>In retrospect I was expecting more action but I was OK with the approach, only it didn't bloom into something really powerful IMHO. The main problem is in the plot device, which is actually the Source Code device. The great ambition of the script is to win on two counts: the mission (into a parallel reality) and reality. The former is more about action, but mixes with wider life concerns, sentiments, while the latter is fuzzier with a difficult blend of mystery, life, duty and trust.<br/><br/>Going back and forth between reality and the parallel reality of the Source Code proves to be a poor narrative choice since it is done much too often and suspense cannot reach high levels once you are just expecting developments on both counts. The inter-cutting with present was greatly criticized in Titanic, but it really added suspense by giving us a better understanding of the technical side, which was only in the background of the lovers story.<br/><br/>On the other hand the cinematography is great. Well there are actually only half a dozen of the train in the countryside, then approaching Chicago, and also of Chicago itself. Most notably are very nice helicopter shots in the opening credits, even if this bears little relevance to the story itself (since Chicago is just the background). But the rest feels cheap, like B-movie cheap. It would be OK if there was a tense suspense, but the constant inter-cutting results in a hurtful discrepancy between great establishing shots on one side (and their redundancies BTW) and the closed narrative spaces (the train and the labs). The patchy look just makes weaker parts more salient and obvious.<br/><br/>I am surprised Source Code got such a fine IMDb rating. I guess it plays to the crowd of Matrix enthusiasts. I admit Source Code aims for originality, while Eagle Eye, for example, is more of a routine actioneer with SF undertones. I personally found Eagle Eye more satisfying in the end. Maybe it aimed lower, but it was not getting pretentious with sentimentalist stuff. Both movies don't succeed in being totally impressive, but one doesn't mess with its inner narrative flow. Having a pieced up narrative is really not piece of cake, and if you fail to make it look great it just looks obvious and pretentious too. In Source Code it is obvious the storyline is stretched to reach the 80-minute mark, and the growing sentimentality is only obvious too, there is nothing really deep in it.<br/><br/>Casting: I was not impressed by Jake Gyllenhaal, he does the job but I wouldn't say the main character is a great part. Michelle Monahan was better here than in Eagle Eye, perhaps because it is more of a quiet girl-next-door part. Vera Farmiga was just wasted in a translucent role. Eventually I find Jeffrey Wright is a very weak actor, I couldn't get how they cast him as Felix Leiter, he is always hamming it to exist in the frame. He certainly contributes a great deal to the cheap B-movie feel here."

","SOURCE CODE (2011) *** ½ Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright. Frenetic and engrossing sci-fi thriller mash-up of a ""GROUNDHOG DAY"" meets ""THE TWILIGHT ZONE"" via ""SPEED"": stoic soldier Gyllenhaal (a career high giving a complex turn) finds himself hurtling back in time to an 8 minute pocket in a governmental/military experiment to unravel a terrorist plot marking Chicago for nuclear annihilation via a commuter train bombing set upon its path and the time ticking away. Novice screenwriter Ben Ripley delivers the sweat-inducing, edge-of-your-seat attention to detail with his pretzel-twisty mind f*cking (ala ""INCEPTION"" – what is real? What isn't?) and director Duncan Jones keeps things even keeled as all hell breaks loose largely in shrewdly making his performers 'talk' and not ""SHOUT"" their precise and important dialogue making the audience listen and think (Thank you!) with his stars doing the heavy lifting with aplomb (Monaghan is a nice touch as the sexy girl-next-door type that Gyllenhaal eventually falls for in the process to save her and perhaps himself).

"Astralan","9","1","8","1 April 2011"," Just when you think you know ...
","Little twist in this movie make you change your mind how it is going to end. Slow to draw you in and almost uninvolving even if you know this is scifie give you ample ""Ah hah!"" moments, then put you back in that unsure mode. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter Stevens, an army helicopter pilot that finds himself flashed into the life of some other man riding a Chicago rail. He comes to facing a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him enough to form what could become an intimate relationship. The panic of the first instance is monumental; he was in a rescue mission one minute then on a train with a crowd of people he has no connection to at all. The only problem he confronts though is that 8 minutes later the train explodes. From there is sheerly up to speculation. Personally, I believe that every decision you make changes the future. The creates parallel realities that could exist for any given instance. On this concept alone, this movie creates one alternate reality after another hence my comment on the ""Ah hah"" moments; they are quickly challenged. Even at the end you conclude it is over then it doesn't end. This is the way it is with alternate or parallel realities. It is never over, only different. Pleasing, suspenseful, oddly engaging, totally unbelievable you follow this near 2 hour romp into the Twilight Zone with surprise that makes it all worth the price of a ticket and maybe a copy of it for your own home. Granted, once you know the ending a re-watch just won't be a satisfying, but it is exceptionally well directed and produced. Recommended."

","Pros:
1. Jake Gyllenhaal (Colter Stevens) per usual gives a brilliant performance.
2. The train setting gives the film an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia which helps to increase the tension.
3. The CGI, in regards to the train, fire, explosions looks surprisingly good. The movie also knows never to over-rely on it.
4. The pacing is fantastic. With a limited plot, it's always a high risk that the movie will start to feel repetitive, however this film keeps the same pace and manages to stay fresh.
5. The ending is simultaneously heartwarming and satisfying.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. The score is extremely overbearing and obnoxious, as well as the fact that it's mostly just stock action music.
2. The film's lighting makes the movie look really cheap and bland.
3. Derek Frost's (Michael Arden) motives for blowing up the train are very weak. He states the ""world is hell,"" and therefore it needs to be reduced to rubble. This reduces the tension, and it induces an eye-roll.
4. There are a few plot-holes. For example: somehow Colter Steven's dad didn't recognise his own son's voice over the phone; the film never explains how Colter Stevens' consciousness can be broadcast into a dead person's memory; and at the end, a new world is mysteriously created with no explanation."

","This film should probably be remembered as a sleeper sci-fi gem. I honestly didn't expect this movie to do well at the box office: It's by a director whose other film had an extremely limited run in theaters, and is remembered now only by independent film fans. However, Duncan Jones has done it again; he has managed to craft, a smart sci-fi thriller that, though more than a bit confusing, manages to tell a surprisingly human tale of terrorism, mind jumping, and how people should proactively get out there and seize the moment. The movie's premise is one that is never sufficiently explained, but is cool enough to warrant curiosity by itself (BTW, calling this a science fiction film is a bit of a stretch, since there really isn't much ""science"" in it). Apparently, a man's brain will still possess enough electricity passing through it to allow someone to hijack their mind for eight minutes to relive this person's final moments. Though this is one of the most ludicrous explanations I have ever heard for anything in a movie, it allows the same tense scenario to be played out differently each time. A former helicopter pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) is thrust into this experience inside a capsule of unspecified origin and location, and is forced to find the culprit of the train-mounted bomb that killed the man whose memory he is reliving.<br/><br/>This really should go down in history as one of Gyllenhaal's best roles, which he slips into like a glove, managing to be so convincing as a frantic abducted soldier and a crime-solving sleuth that you can see these emotions clearly in his eyes as he is constantly switched between these roles. Along for the ride is the deceased's love interest (Michelle Monaghan), whose cheerful innocence and ignorance of the crisis at hand remind you that this is a simulated reality, that in real life, no one was aware of their imminent demise. She is who ultimately keeps the story's human touch from slipping out of its grasp, and does so with an ease to rival Jake's.<br/><br/>There are two stories playing out in here: one is the main train-bomb thing, and the other is inside the dome, as Gyllenhaal desperately tries to determine where he his, what his family knows about him, and who is keeping him... wherever he is. Vera Farmiga plays the officer in charge of communicating with Gyllenhaal's character, and she is Monaghan's living counterpart, reminding Gyllenhaal constantly that there will be another bomb, and that this is why he needs to find the one who destroyed the train, blah blah blah. The parts taking place within reality are the ones meant to make you think, the parts in the dead guy's mind are to entertain, and manage to do so consistently, despite the same scenario looping about seven times over the course of the film.<br/><br/>The way in which Gyllenhaal's character goes about trying to solve the mystery is elegant in how easy it is to relate to; he starts out not having a clue of how to go about his task, and slowly manages to work his way through various methods of detection, such as from which direction the explosion came, in which room the bomb is, calling the terrorist from the cell phone meant to detonate the bomb, and finally tracking down the actual person responsible. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Monaghan is strong, and everything about them suggests that they are the characters they are meant to be seen as, which begs the question as to whether the audience is meant to focus on the story or the characters.<br/><br/>Though the ending makes absolutely zero sense, it further strengthens the message that people need to get out there and live life to the fullest. This is, admittedly, and unusual message for a sci-fi thriller to have, and fortunately, is pulled off brilliantly. This movie is not one that will be made clearer by multiple viewings, which is good, because this little gem will shine in your memory for a while after you leave the theater."

"bretwoods","9","0","1","27 June 2019"," A Thought-Provoking (but still blockbuster-esque) Film
","The opening credits are displayed over a running sequence of fly-overs of the city of Chicago, accompanied by a score that is generically common in the thriller genre. The story begins when the protagonist, Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), awakens on a commuter train outside Chicago. In the seat across from him sits Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), a friend who recognizes him as ""Sean,"" and immediately engages him in conversation, telling him she took his advice. But Captain Stevens does not recognize his companion or his surroundings; when he first awakes on the train he knows as little about what is happening to him as does the audience. At one point he notices a brief reflection in the window of the train that startles him, and he excuses himself and walks to the lavatory, where he discovers that his reflection is that of another man. Somewhat panicked, Stevens spends eight minutes looking for clues as to what is happening to him, until the train abruptly explodes, killing everyone aboard.<br/><br/>Stevens then awakes in a small capsule, strapped into a seat that appears similar to a pilot's chair. He is confused and disoriented-as is the audience by this point-and as he attempts to loosen his seat belt, a voice over the intercom keeps hailing him. Stevens finally establishes communication with Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), who puts him through a series of tests to help orient him to what is happening. She tells him that a train exploded just after 7:45 AM outside of Chicago this morning, and that using a revolutionary quantum computer technology, he is serving his country by entering the mind and/or memories of one of the passengers who died aboard the train. This is apparently possible due to a mystery of the human mind, in that there is an ""afterglow""-an effective window of eight minutes where electrical activity is still possible and present within the neural pathways. Later in the film, more details regarding this process emerge, though they are never explicitly tackled as part of the story. Rather they function as an implicit element, assumed to work for any number of reasons.<br/><br/>Goodwin and the team monitoring this computer ""source code"" technology need Stevens as their operative. He must learn who planted the explosives in the train in order to track down the bomber and stop him from additional planned attacks on the city that were threatened for later that day. In these early moments, though, Stevens is confused and cannot remember how he got into this ""capsule,"" where his unit in Afghanistan is, or anything immediately before he woke up on the train. His identity, however, and his memories before the immediate events that would have led him to this current situation are all intact.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prompted by an agitated Doctor Routledge (Jeffrey Wright), Goodwin sends Captain Stevens ""back in,"" and he wakes up in the same moment as before. This time, having a greater sense of his bearings on the train, Stevens tries to find information about himself and what happened to his unit in Afghanistan, in addition to interacting with other individuals on the train in order to discover the location of the bomb and the identity of the bomber. Each time he goes back, he begins at the same moment and has eight minutes before the bomb explodes. Over the course of several trials, each of which end with the same result (the bombing of the train), the surface of the plot seems to suggest that the source code technology allows Stevens to enter the memories of someone on the train. However, more details become apparent to Stevens with each ""trip"" as the story progresses, all of which suggest there is more at work within the process. For example, Stevens begins to suspect that he is dead, and confronts Goodwin about it. Both she and Doctor Routledge are reluctant to give Stevens any immediate details, claiming several times that all other aspects of the mission are ""irrelevant."" But Stevens can't let it go, and finally uncovers that his body experienced an accident that no one could survive. His brain is hooked up to electrodes that allow his neural map to be read and utilized by the source code.<br/><br/>When that proverbial cat is out of the bag is when, for me, this movie goes from being a decent action/scifi/thriller to an almost brilliant, multi-layered commentary on quantum consciousness, quantum reality, and experiential directionality my review here. When it is discovered that Stevens is essentially ""dead,"" and that his consciousness exists as a template for use within the source code, Doctor Routledge is adamant about keeping Stevens focused on the task at hand-finding the bomber. Goodwin also encourages Stevens to work to find the bomber, though she is more sympathetic to his plight. Both Routledge and Goodwin, though, approach the situation from their own point in their own reality-that Stevens is only able to enter the memories and ""afterglow"" of the man Sean who was present on the train before the explosion. Approaching the outcome of events from this standpoint would hinder one from seeing how far this film reaches.<br/><br/>Stevens finally locates the bomber, and brings the information back to Goodwin and Routledge, who dispatch operatives in their reality. There are news clips that show the bomber's white van being stopped; Stevens's information checks out and the bomber is stopped. At this point in the film, Stevens appeals to Goodwin to send him back inside and give him the opportunity to save the passengers. She comments that it cannot be done, that it is impossible to change events, but Stevens flippantly says he understands that, but that Goodwin and Routledge are wrong-he can change things. Goodwin promises Stevens that she will send him back for one last trip, eight minutes of time inside the source code, after which she will terminate his life in her reality. This takes place much to the disapproval of Doctor Routledge, who wants to wipe Stevens's memories and set him up with another mission now that the source code program is successful.<br/><br/>While back in the moments before the initial explosion, Stevens uses the information he has learned along the way to disarm the train bomb, stop the bomber by handcuffing him to the inside of a rail car, and send Goodwin an email. He saves the people on the train, and the people in Chicago, from the bombs, and steps into a new life with Christina. It is in this science fiction that his actions within the source code make sense in an Einsteinian quantum consciousness paradigm.<br/><br/>Each time the source code sends Colter Stevens back into the ""afterglow"" of the train victim Sean's neural map, he is sent back with eight minutes of time to effect a change. Each time, however, any changes he made ended with a train explosion that did not create a great sense of entropic change from the reality in which Goodwin and Routledge first sent him into the source code. While back in that kinetic window, however, Stevens's consciousness essentially left this reality and traveled to another reality, where there was another Goodwin and another Routledge working with another Stevens in the source code lab. The Captain's consciousness transferred from our reality back into Sean's reality (where he was presumably asleep), and when he managed to save the people on the train, he essentially created a completely new reality for hundreds of other neural consciousnesses. These alternate realities are foreshadowed in the film when Captain Stevens asks Goodwin if she thinks there are other versions of herself out there somewhere. One who never got married, one who never got divorced, etc.<br/><br/>While the consciousness of Stevens was inside Sean's body, he was acting out that experiential reality in the moment, from the experiential direction of that particular consciousness. For him in that moment it was essentially another reality altogether. He was able to email the Goodwin of that reality-a different Goodwin than the one who originally sent him into the source code. She was able to receive that email because Stevens stopped the momentous event that triggered the need for source code to be used in the initial reality. This, of course, was the largest hole in the film in that the power of the source code to access the eight minute afterglow of the human brain was never addressed, thus befuddling any reason for one quantum reality to be out of temporal sync with another (though not excluding that possibility). Still, assuming that the technology is based on interactive quantum energy, the reasons why it would be possible are largely irrelevant. Regardless, the end result is a temporal anomaly due to the transfer of one consciousness into a reality where it already exists in a different (inactive) version. This leads Stevens's email to ask Goodwin to be gentle with this alternate version of himself, and tell him that ""everything will be okay.""<br/><br/>When Stevens's body was terminated by Goodwin while he was inside the source code, his consciousness remained in the new reality, an alternate energy pattern able to interact in its new experiential parameters with nothing connecting it to its former reality (since for Stevens and presumably Sean that reality no longer exists). Ultimately he discovered that the source code does not just allow people to access information from memories, but due to the afterglow's temporal shift allows the source code operative to alter the nature of reality itself-to create new realities. The end of the film also shows us that the source code program still exists in this newly formed version of reality, on the lookout for the next crisis that will prove its importance.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie on multiple levels. There are issues in that there are hollow elements of the story and in the temporal aspects of the science fiction, but overall, as a piece on quantum consciousness and rethinking alternate realities and Bose-Einstein condensates in quantum computing, it was pretty trippy."

It was important that Captain Colter Stevens character was casted right due to the role he had carrying the movie. His humour, confusion and likability meant that Source Code was a real success as the story was already exciting and interesting. Although short Source Code is intelligent and rewarding, making it one of the best thrillers of recent times."

","Source Code is a fun and interesting take on what at first seems to be high tech memory analysis where an Air Force Captain has his consciousness placed into the last 8 minutes of a man who died in a terrorist attack.<br/><br/>The actual procedure is far beyond that we learn in the end as the tech was actually placing the Captain's consciousness into that dead person in an alternate reality that was identical to reality up to that point.<br/><br/>The problem is less with the story or tech since this is a Sci-Fi movie and accepting that future tech and alternate realities are par for course, but with the fact that the scientists involved don't realize that changing what happened makes it not a memory. Although they may just be making assumptions that the tech allows the simulation of sorts since that is as believable as alternate realities I suppose.<br/><br/>The reviews I have read that feel the later scenes and the final run through the source code somehow don't make sense led me to post a review. Simply put, the last scenes at Nellis are in the alternate reality. Therefore the train didn't blow up. The Captain is still alive in the device.<br/><br/>Of course I feel a little bad for the teacher in that alternate reality as he ceases to exist when the Captain's consciousness from the first reality takes over - although since he would have died otherwise maybe not as tragic as it seems at first."

"kalkaanslag-62205","10","0","1","6 January 2018"," In par with the best Sci-fi thrillers, like Inception
","Source Code is one of my favorite movies of all time! It's sublimely acted and directed, and many of the plothole-y problems others have had with it, do seem quite far fetched, but still plausible to me. (Spoilers beneath)<br/><br/>One question many people have is where the mind of the history teacher goes when his body is taken over. My initial thought was that it just gets erased, or replaced, like a CD that you could burn. This only adds to an intriguing perspective; whether this is ethically right.<br/><br/>Another interesting ethical question this movie rises, is whether lives in a parallel universe matter. Our protagonist cares a lot about the passengers on the train, but does their alternate existence matter at all in a universe where they've already died?<br/><br/>What I loved was that there is - apart from the bomber, of course - no real bad guy in the end of the movie. In the part where Colleen wants to accept the wishes of Colter and let him die, the actions of the Doctor are equally good, just from a different standpoint. Colleen wants relieve Colter of his tormenting state of artificial consciousness, which ends up giving him a second life which he loves, instead of the mental imprisonment he would have to endure. However, the Doctor's need to keep him alive is of greater humanitarian benefit, as Colter could help to prevent future catastrophes.<br/><br/>The ending is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Colter sending the email to Colleen gives her just enough clues to the outcome of the Source Code experiment, and the Doctor's comment about the experiment not having been done in this universe really reminds you how different, yet similar this universe is to the original. It also provides the most intriguing question of the film: Has this been done before? Have the instructions that Colter gives to Colleen been given in the first universe as well? Thus, is the first universe already a artificially created one by Source Code? <br/><br/>In conclusion: Source Code is a non-stop thrill ride that keeps you guessing throughout the movie, and provides answers as our protagonist is figuring it out as well. It's intelligent, beautifully shot and created, thought provoking and just a ton of fun. 10/10, must see!"

I mean, I'm pretty sure it's possible to answer those same questions without using all that cliché that the blockbusters of Hollywood are used to—and here's a thing that had blurred some part of my excitement about Source Code: a movie with a great potential that lost it among schemas that people are already tired of.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the photography and soundtrack are good. And that's all. Worth to keep in mind that this *can* occur due to the lack of places our characters have been—three or four, at max—, which delivers a good experience, but an advise for you: don't expect anything breathtaking —you'll not get.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a good movie.

","Source Code (2011): Dir: Duncan Jones / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Michael Arden: Total mind blow that takes its life and death matters to unbelievable heights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a deceased military soldier who finds himself thrown into a government experiment where he resumes the body of someone aboard a train that will explode via bomb in eight minutes. He has no idea what is happening or how he got there but he is instructed by a couple officials via screen that he needs to find the bomber. That means repeated visits and blown to bits but each return he stumbles upon something new to clue in a suspect. Director Duncan Jones delivers a great credits opening with great camera panning but the screenplay plays like an action version of Groundhog Day. Gyllenhaal is a capable actor and he does a convicting job juggling the crime as well as the lives of those on board. We learn that his character is deceased, so that leaves the nitwit happy ending where he ends up in the body of someone else, to be tacky and a complete shove in the spiritual sense. Michelle Monaghan is pleasant as the girlfriend who questions him and is caught up in the repeated investigation. Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright play Gyllenhaal's contacts who communicate via screen. Both have different views with regards to this experiment and both actors elevate the material from potential formula. Michael Arden is featured in a cameo as the bomber whom Gyllenhaal must seek out and put a stop to. Well made entertainment but pointless exercise in time travel. Score: 5 / 10"

Thus, it gives a sense of feeling to the audience that its actually a time travel. In a particular scene in the movie, Source Code is described as a time displacement. Its not a time travel.

","This is a movie about data extraction from the human mind. When a person goes into a coma (for example), technology and professionals use a technique to gather information from a person who is unable to communicate. The information is gathered through tapping into the mind, to communicate with the mind of the person. A simulated world is created for the subject to walk around in and interact with (think of it like Avatar, but for people who are physically disabled throughout the entire body, except their mind). Then, the person has to accomplish some goal, because doing so is the only way their mind can communicate with the extractors. This is in part because they barely remember anything. So the problem solving, ends with a solution that is actually what the mind was trying to tell the extractors.<br/><br/>But, it was just a decent movie to me. The ending is anticlimactic. It was also trying to have a twist, but for the wrong reasons. The writer was trying to be cute, rather than entertaining. The movie is kind of another ""protagonist reliving the same day over and over until they do something right"" story. It was like the writer realized that it actually wasn't too unique after all, so they tried to make the ending bizarre. It just came across as an awkward movie. I think this could have been better.

","This movie could have been far more satisfying. You have to suspend your sense of logic, as you do in most sci-fi movies, to accept the premise that a dead soldier can be transported into the body of another man about to be blown up on a train. One question that is never addressed is; where did this man's soul, his personality, go during those eight minutes when Jake Gyllenhaal's character took over his body? <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is okay in the lead role, but how he can be sold as a sex symbol is beyond me. Those huge, bug eyes of his alone should turn off a lot of people. The lovely Vera Farmiga is excellent here, as always, but it's a thankless role and she isn't given much to do. Michelle Monaghan's character seems shallow and isn't developed at all (actually, none of the characters are developed whatsoever and come off as empty shells). <br/><br/>The movie trots out two of its favorite, stereotypical casting devices; the head of the super secret project is one of those incredible black computer geniuses, which are usually played by Morgan Freeman. In any event, they are plentiful in Hollywood. And the bad guy, the lone ""nut"" terrorist who is singlehandedly holding the country hostage, is a dumpy, very innocent looking white male. Wow- didn't see that one coming! Does the movie industry really think no one notices this kind of stuff? <br/><br/>The movie borrows heavily from ""Groundhog Day"" and other superior films, but the premise was interesting enough that, with a little more creative thought, and a better lead actor, it could have been much better."

It could have been worth half watching over the Internet except Russell Peters ruins it. It could have been improved with some cowboys on spaceships with lots of slave girls. But Source Code is no The Purge. Visually it's dark and unappealing. Nothing to titillate or arouse here. The music is overly dramatic to no apparent purpose. The blatant product placements are great, but the ads before the movie have more of those, framed better, without the annoying people playing amateur actor in between. Source Code tries hard to trick and mislead you, like Agatha Cristie could. Sadly it fails, and given the rest of the elements, you don't even care that it fails. I really did watch this all the way to the end, just in case it turned into a different movie half way, or the protagonist started claiming ""I see dead people."" There are plenty of Philip K. Dick stories that haven't been remade into movies often enough yet, so no excuse not to have a decent story to work from, even for giving such a shoddy treatment as this.

","Many of the objections cited here against various films, which invariably begin with the claim that 'this is 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back', baffle me. Those involved in filmmaking do so for any number of reasons ranging from the purely commercial to artistic and political, and however good or bad one thinks a film is, it is almost always very obvious why a particular film was made. And usually it is to attract a fee-paying public to cough up the readies to, naturally, cover all production costs and then turn a handsome profit. Source Code, billed as a sci-fi thriller, is one such film. But a great many user reviews on this website lambast it for 'poor science' and using various computer terms misleadingly. Well, what on earth were they expecting from a film? What did they make of the Star Wars series, of The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Jurassic Park and any number of other films which deal, ever so superficially, science? So please don't be put off by some of the criticisms here. Source Code is a rollicking, very entertaining, intriguing and exciting film. No more, no less. It makes no grand statement, doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps you watching, includes loads of quite daft science, has a touching, though quite slight, romantic angle, and for my money is worth the time of anyone who would like to relax watching a well-made, entertaining film. Don't listen to the harping critics, sit down and watch this. You won't be a 'better person' afterwards, you won't have altered your political views, you won't be in tears, and you most definitely won't have learnt a little more science, but you will have enjoyed a great piece of sci-fi thriller hokum."

","Duncan Jones directs ""Source Code"". The plot? A terrorist plants a bomb on a train. The bomb explodes, killing several hundred people, including passenger Sean Fentress. When the terrorist reveals that he shall soon detonate another bomb, a secret Government Agency springs into action. In their possession is a supercomputer dubbed Source Code. Source Code, we are initially told, allows its ""pilot"" to ""enter memories"" once belonging to recovered, dead bodies. As Sean Fentress' body is the only body on the train not to have been completely pulverised, it is selected to be used by Source Code. The plan? Army Pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) will use Source Code to ""go into Sean's memory"". Once there, he will search Fentress' head for clues which will hopefully allow law enforcement officers in the present to stop the terrorist and thwart his second detonation. Sounds familiar? The plot's Tony Scott's ""Deja Vu"", mixed in with a little ""Rashomon"", ""12 Monkey's"", ""Quantum Leap"", ""Primer"" and ""Groundhog Day"".<br/><br/>Like ""Deja Vu"" it is also eventually revealed that the supercomputer in question is a lot more powerful than its creators perceive. Source Code (again like ""Deja Vu"") isn't simply creating an interactive simulation based on Sean's memories, instead it's actively creating a wormhole which allows Colter to travel back in time and into a parallel, alternate universe. In both films there are temporal limitations as to how long this ""gateway"" can be left open and in both films a new parallel time-line is created every time our hero ""jumps"" into an alternate universe. In ""Source Code's"" case, Colter repeatedly relives the last 8 minutes of Sean's life, until, of course, he collects enough clues to stop the terrorist. As his body is dying in the present (his helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan), Colter asks to be left inside Source Code. Here he is a given a cutesy ""happily ever after climax"". This climax ignores a bevy of interesting points. Firstly, if we allow for parallel universes, Colter's actions were entirely pointless; the terrorist succeeded in any number of alternate time-lines and our Colter only in one. Secondly, for Colter to continue living in his new, parallel universe, he would have usurped and effectively killed Sean, whose body he now possesses. Thirdly, as Source Code triggers the creation of parallel universes, and as it actively creates alternate realities, during every one of Colter's jumps he would have triggered a whole new round of train explosions. The guy's practically a mass murderer.<br/><br/>Duncan's film is at its best when its evoking Hitchcock, specifically the aesthetic of ""North by Northwest"" and the tone of ""The Lady Vanishes"". His aesthetic is one of clean lines, lots of horizontals and verticals, lots of nice, uncluttered aerial footage (of train lines and well manicured landscapes), and some of his architectural choices (Millenium Park, The Cloud Gate) are somewhat interesting (a kind of contradictory, postmodern futurism). The film's classier than Tony Scott's ""Deja Vu"", but the sleazy nature of Scott's film also made it a bit better; less pretentious and free to go odd places. ""Source Code"", in contrast, is repetitive, overstays its welcome and pretends to be about a hero who cheats chronology in order to save the lives of strangers, yet is quite cynical in the way its train passengers are repeatedly collected and coldly murdered/dispatched. The film's part of a wave of time travel movies, all of which tap into a very specific fantasy. Like the tag-line to ""Quantum Leap"", these heroes ""leap from life to life, time period to time period, striving to put right what once went wrong"". It's the fantasy of a military industry complex that, not content to neurotically control everything in the present, must reach far into the past, future and even alternative realities, all to stop terrorist bogeymen.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing."

He doesn't think he is being the whole truth and becomes determined to find out just how he got there and prove that he can change what happened.<br/><br/>This sci-fi thriller starts with a bang and manages to keep things tense right until the end; there is more than one mystery as not only is the bomber's identity unknown there is also the matter of how Capt. Stevens got into the programme when his last memory was of serving in Afghanistan and the question of whether or not he can save anybody. Director Douglas Jones does a good job keeping the action going without sacrificing a decent plot and star Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a solid performance as Capt. Stevens. There are some good surprises during the film; most importantly concerning how he came to be selected for the mission I won't spoil that here though. The film isn't without its faults though; the explosion looks like CGI rather than a real explosion which was a shame as we see it several times. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you enjoy thrillers with a sci-fi twist."

","Source Code finds Army Helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) waking up in complete disarray to his surroundings on a train with people treating him as someone he isn't. Eventually the train explodes and he wakes up once again to find out he will be inserted into an alternate timeline for eight minutes at a time with the mission of finding out who was responsible for the bombing of the train before the same person sets of a bomb in downtown Chicago later that day.<br/><br/>Source code has a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time and a lot of potential plot holes. After all, there is the mystery of who Colter is, who bombed the train, the science behind it all, the relationship between Colter and Christina Warren (Monaghan), a passenger on the train and the whole alternative timeline business. Yet, somehow the film sidesteps inevitable plot holes and questions and manages to make an endearing sci-fi action film because of its pacing, entertainment value, concepts, and performances of almost every actor and actress in the film.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is a big part of why this film works as he plays each emotion he goes through with his own edge. Making you feel for him and even laugh at him at some points as he frantically searches the train and nearly assaults innocent passengers thinking they were suspects. I also believed him when he started to care for Christina Warren which is also a tribute to how well Michelle Monaghan played her part as the innocent and lovable passenger on the train. This could have seemed forced as another typical love story shoved into the context of another film that didn't need it but because of the films excellent pace and acting it actually added to the story. Even the story going on behind the scenes between Captain Goodwin (Farminga) and Dr. Rutledge (Wright) as the two people pulling the strings behind Source Code matter to the film as they toe the line between heartless conductors of a science experiment to people trying to do the right thing and save lives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately some loose ends and plot holes are inevitable with a story like this but Source Code is so well oiled that it runs seamlessly through them as it focuses on the heart of the story embedded in the suspense of the situation and it's well written characters. It asks some interesting questions, invests you in the characters and manages to be quite entertaining at the same time."

","I stumbled across this film more by accident than design but decided to give it a try. I have always liked Jake Gs work. The plot has been outlined in other reviews so I won't go there but I have to say I was very quickly intrigued by the strange concept which I hoped would not become another Inception inspired mess.<br/><br/>But the story holds it course even if it is a little uneven and obviously far fetched. The principal actors do a very good job and you are kept guessing until the very end, which I think leaves the way open for a sequel.<br/><br/>After some of the dross that has been pumped out as science fiction in recent times (such as Avatar and Prometheus) this is miles ahead of Inception and close to the original Matrix.<br/><br/>Recommended if for no other reason than for the gorgeous Michelle Monaghan."

It defies a truth people tried to avoid forever: a man lives just once, and then it comes judgment. Or in more simpler words: in this world you can only live once.

"Schnayblay","8","0","1","21 April 2012"," This Decade's ""Minority Report"" is Here...
","When I saw the trailer for ""Source Code"", I immediately thought ""this looks like it could be really awesome or really dumb"". I was kind of leaning towards dumb because there aren't many sci-fi thrillers that are good these days. So I held off on renting it. But I finally did because I saw the trailer again and was like, ""you know what, I'm going to watch ""Source Code"" finally"". And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Source Code"" involves Captain Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) being abducted by a government project so he can go back in time into the body of another man to stop a terrorist from blowing up a Chicago train. I have to say, this premise always sounded really cool. Anything involving time travel in any way shape or form is always a good thing. But the cool thing about ""Source Code"" is, as it's said in the film, it's not time travel, it's time reassignment. It isn't explained too well and I have a hard enough time trying to think about it as I'm writing this, but when you're watching the film, you understand, and that's really what matters. This isn't a time travel film you should go all sciencey on. It's just meant to give you a basic explanation for how the premise of this movie can even work.<br/><br/>Acting is good. Nothing Oscar worthy, but good performances none the less. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good as Colter. He brings a lot of frantic and chaotic energy to the screen. Colter is a very believable character. You sympathize with this guy and you really believe him. It kind of reminds me of Bruce Willis' performance in the original ""Die Hard"". Even though he's in this ridiculous situation, he's still making wise-ass jokes and being smart. It's a really enjoyable performance that really shows how diverse an actor Jake Gyllenhaal really is.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan plays Christine, Colter's love interest. Her character isn't that developed since we hear a lot of the same facts about her repeatedly, but overall she's a decent character. I didn't think she was there for much, except so that the ending of the film could even happen. But I'll get to that later.<br/><br/>I like how small the scale of this movie is. Overall, there are three main sets; the capsule that Colter is stuck in, the headquarters for Source Code, and the train. You get associated with these areas real fast, and it kind of helps to put you in Colter's shoes. You're just seeing the same stuff over and over again. You already know where everything is, what's going to happen and how it will happen, but each trip is a little different.<br/><br/>The final half an hour of the film is excellent. This is where Jake Gyllenhaal's acting skills are really spotlighted. He practically has this whole last half hour to show off what he can do. We get to see a cocky Colter, an emotional Colter, and a romantic Colter. We get to see all sides to this character in the span of this hour and a half film, and that's what makes him so believable.<br/><br/>The ending is interesting. I'm not going to spoil it but I'll put my feelings out there. I think it was the right move, story wise, but I think it wasn't executed the best. It's still good, but I think the real thing that kills it is the lack of emotion in Jake Gyllenhaal's final narration. Especially because this ending is emotional. Overall, I think ""Source Code"" was very enjoyable. While not the most thrilling of movies and definitely not at all action-packed, ""Source Code"" will make your mind think. A lot of people might not get it, and a lot might think it was very generic, and I could see why. So I say, at least watch ""Source Code"". You may be surprised."

One more thing about this is that Source code it's all about action and syfy. Quantic physics ain't so much syfy nowadays, but action movies doesn't have to be all about explosions and gunshots every 5 seconds. At this point, Source code really went great.<br/><br/>The plot takes us by surprise almost every time and this is what can guarantee an overall rate to any movie.<br/><br/>One of SOurce Code problems were that it's soundtrack looks like Harry Potter. No Kidding. We can almost see wands about to come out from people pockets.<br/><br/>It's not always a movie can hold out attention for an hour and half without letting us down by the end. Source code is amazing at this point, too pity it's too short (but this is questionable).<br/><br/>I'd recommend it more than just a pass-time, but as something to be watched again, to be understanded more than just the story itself.<br/><br/>Watch like if you could go back not to just to change the future, but to understand the lives you haven't lived."

","One of the best films I have seen in recent years. Full of suspense and questions that take a while to be resolved. Like most science fiction, you have to suspend rational thinking to really enjoy the film, but unlike most science fiction you do not have to do it that much! OK so time travel into the past is not really possible according to the laws of physics, who cares. The point is, it raises lots of ""what if"" questions that keep you enthralled from the beginning to the end of the film. The acting is good- Jake Gillenhall is surprisingly compelling as the agent who is trying to work out why he is on the train and why he does not die when the train explodes.

","Source Code is a combination of Quantum Leap, Ground Hog Day and Deja Vu, taking the better qualities of each and turning out an entertaining science-fiction movie.<br/><br/>Also, and rather crucially, the creators took time to look at this movie as a piece of entertainment and craft it in such a way as to remain entertaining without it becoming exceptionally repetitive (which will become abundantly clear once you watch the movie and understand the core premise).<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is as reliable as ever as Colter Stevens, our deeply confused but redoubtable hero, and Jeffrey Wright nails the crippled academic with an ego, playing Dr. Rutledge.<br/><br/>A quality I enjoy in this kind of fast-paced whodunit movie is following the clues and getting ahead of the story, which is doable if you pay attention to the details.

","Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train to discover he's assumed the identity (and body) of someone named Sean Fentress. Confusion quickly sets in for the military pilot - his last memory is of a mission gone haywire in Afghanistan. Eight minutes later, after the train explodes, he's strapped inside a cold, dark pod. He is soon contacted by Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who bombards him with questions about the train and the explosion. Struggling to make sense of what happened, he fires back with questions of his own. Careful not to disclose too much information, Goodwin instructs him that he has eight minutes to track down the bomb and the bomber. Any deviation from the mission, including trying to save passengers, is highly discouraged. <br/><br/>He's transported back into Sean's body over and over until, finally, he speaks to a man who appears to be in charge of the mysterious operation, Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). It turns out that Colter is in a project called Source Code, which allows him to relive the last eight minutes of Sean's life in order to gather valuables clues about the bomber. For Rutledge, it's about the objective. For Colter, it's now about saving the lives of the passengers, particularly Christina (Michelle Monaghan), the pretty and flirtatious passenger he's steadily been growing feelings for. One problem: Source Code is not time travel - it's time reassignment. It's metaphysics, quantum theory, and a host of other scientific concepts that will likely fly over most viewers' heads but don't worry, you don't need to understand how Source Code works in order to enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>Source Code has been mentioned with and compared to Nolan's wildly popular dream invasion flick, Inception. Having seen both, I urge you not to go into Source Code expecting an Inception knock-off. While both films have their strengths, I found Jones' action/sci-fi/thriller miles better with its character development. Another plus is that it has a very Hitchcockian/The Twilight Zone feel to it in that it relies on its story and the actors, rather than extravagant CGI and a dramatic soundtrack. Having said that, as much as I gripe about the over-use of CGI, the special effects in this movie are rather underwhelming and a bit dated. No biggie, though. This isn't the kind of movie that relies on grandiose computer generated imaging and it's certainly not hindered by any lack of it. <br/><br/>Ironically, I loved this film (and its delightfully dreamy leading man) until the last eight minutes. A 9/10 knocked down to an 8/10 for its ridiculously sentimental, typical Hollywood ""and they all lived happily ever after"" ending. I'm not a pessimist. I root for the underdog. I believe in soulmates and love at first sight. I like to see karma reward the good guy or gal but closure should be a resolution that makes sense for the characters and viewers in a way that doesn't completely insult either parties. There's poignant (frozen kiss) and then there's sickly sweet (let's go look at our reflections in the big, shiny thing). <br/><br/>I think Source Code is more suited for mainstream audiences than films like Inception or 12 Monkeys so I give it the go-ahead to most of you out there."

","I liked director Duncan Jones' earlier movie Moon, which was a throwback to those thoughtful early 70s sci-movies. And this skilfully crafted follow-up works just as well. It is, of course, reminiscent of Quantum Leap, Mememto and Groundhog Day; but it's how the story is told and the little details that make this a superior work.<br/><br/>I suppose it's a bit like a clever B movie of yesteryear; running just 89 minutes, Jones doesn't waste a second of screen time (and how many directors avoid that pitfall these days?) delivering an engrossing and smart entertainment.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal gives a good performance in the lead role and he's ably supported by Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga. Some of of the other support acting is a little weak, but this isn't a major concern. I'm not going to mention any plot twists, but the story basically concerns Gyllenhall's attempt to uncover the identity of a bomber on a Chicago-bound train - except in this case he's actually using a very special kind of time-travel - one that can't change history. I'm deliberately being a little misleading here so not to spoil things.<br/><br/>I'm still slightly puzzled by the text message sent to Goodwin at the end of the film, i.e. how can ol' Jake actually do it given what's been told to us before. But maybe I just need to watch it again.<br/><br/>Source Code is an entertaining sci-fi thriller with a heart, and it looks good, too."

Mission Impossible 4, that came out only a year later, ran for 2 hours and 10 minutes, and it was part comedy. TWICE, we had a flutter of special effects and quick explosion to signify the lead character had traveled into the Source Code and had died before finding anything, 16 minutes had passed in the structure of the film that we didn't get to see. For a film that is only 93 minutes long, how dare you quickly hash over anything!<br/><br/>This film has no artistic discipline, the premise is interesting if entirely unbelievable, the main character has 8 minutes, EXACTLY 8 minutes, to avert a disaster. Can you not afford a stopwatch? It was always short of that 8 minutes and often it jumped around, give me exactly 8 minutes, no cuts please, that is what I would expect from a great film, discipline. The last trip into the Source Code was a farce, Colter defuses the bomb and apprehends the suspect in about 30 seconds due to cuts. <br/><br/>SERIOUS SPOILER: The main character is actually dead. Okay, I actually think that is interesting, just decide what your focal point is. I'm not sure what the movie was mostly about, was it about relationships? Was it about saving the world? Was it about death and alternate realities? I think it was about all three equally. Too many things happening for a 93 minute film, all meaning was rendered mute by the fact it rushed through so much. <br/><br/>Deja Vu has a lower rating but is a far better film in my opinion. Its running time is 126 minutes and it is much better off for it, it gives it time to develop the thriller plot more.<br/><br/>Source Code is not a great film, it may be in some respects be a good film, an enjoyable watch, but it is not art, it should be closer to 6.5/10 then 7.5/10 because it isn't that good.

","Source Code (2011) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Strange but satisfying science-fiction film has soldier Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) waking up on a Chicago train talking to a woman (Michelle Monaghan) that he doesn't know when eight-minutes later the train blows up from a terrorist attack. Colter then wakes up as part of a scientific experiment, which allows a source code to be used to transport someone back in time to re-live someone's final eight-minutes, which the soldier is doing for a man on the train. Colter must keep investigating these final minutes to try and determine who set the bomb off and to prevent a future attack. SOURCE CODE has a complicated storyline and a very far-fetched premise but director Duncan Jones does a marvelous job at making sure you can follow it and never got lost in the twists and turns. The movie's certainly a lot harder to explain than actually watch because once the story does pick up and take off you're really on the edge of your seat in thrills. Gyllenhaal offers up another excellent performance and it's this performance that really helps draw you into the material. Just look at the first scene where he wakes up not knowing why he's on the train and the level of confusion that he gives off matches what the viewer is feeling. Gyllenhaal not only makes for a good lead but he also comes across as someone you can follow throughout the film. Monaghan doesn't have as much to do but she too is charming in the part and Vera Farmiga is also very good in her role. I think a lot of credit has to go to Ben Ripley's screenplay because it mixes so many different genres but it never gets watered down or to the point where you simply don't care. It's a rather complicated bit of science and fiction but Ripley's story never crosses the line to the point where it's a turn off or to the point where the viewer just won't care what's going on. Jones' direction perfectly brings the material to life and the way he floats us through the action pieces was very good and I especially liked the different ways the eight-minutes were shown."

","This movie used to be actually excellent I assumed the performing is there and so is the script each smartly done. The only grievance of the script I would say is the theme it has been performed earlier than with 'minority reviews' with Tom Cruise and 'Dejavu'with Denzel Washington that is why I best gave it 7/10, however nonetheless for sure value watching. Duncan Jones pulls an excellent script in combination- best producer and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are each good actors and play their portions smartly within the film. The finishing is in point of fact good as you do not be expecting Jake to study back to the crew an 'addition' to what the supply code can reach I believed it used to be a excellent turn. I might imagine there will likely be a 2nd source code being produced soon I believe it is going to paintings."

The actress playing Christina is also very good, and Vera Farmiga is great as always, especially in a situation where she only shows her face for 95% of the movie.<br/><br/>If you like movies with twists this is for you, but it is definitely not your typical predictable action movie.<br/><br/>At the end, it is a tale about what is important in life, and shows us once more how life is rare and that we should value every 8 minutes of it.

","This movie really makes all the mistakes that a Rod Serling or an Alfred Hitchcock would NOT have made. I don't want to give any spoilers but the issue here in this sci-fi area is about information. Who knows what about what? And it really does not add anything to the plot here the way it is done. It does not add anything to the suspense either. It just makes us wonder: ""Why are the characters pretending they don't have information of what is going on?"" It would have been much more interesting if the VIEWER did not know what is going on. But this cliché about the main character not knowing who he is, identity, etc. is just not working at all in this movie. The movie has other qualities though, and it is really like a Twilight Episode. One of the weaker episodes though."
"pink_wall","8","0","1","26 December 2011"," One of the best action movies I've seen!
","I'm usually very picky with movies; there's very few movies who make it to my favorite list. If a movie I'm watching hasn't impressed me already from the beginning, I easily get restless and in some cases even leave the room. However, Source Code got me completely HOOKED.<br/><br/>I decided to watch it since I heard Jake Gyllenhaal was the main character (I've seen what an amazing actor he is from previous movies)but it wasn't Jake who made the movie golden. The actual plot is what caught me off guard and kept me interested. The movie was breathtaking from start until finish, not leaving a single second where I'd feel bored. Even if the amazingly good looking Jake Gyllenhaal himself would've sat next to me while I was watching it, I still wouldn't have taken my eyes off the screen. Such an exciting story with unpredicted scenes and originality. I remember getting frustrated when I could tell that the movie was ending because I just wanted more, hoping that they'll make a sequel to it. <br/><br/>It's not a typical action movie where there's tons of explosions and gun shots. Source Code had a certain class to it, holding back unnecessary action with a flawless plot. By making the Source Code the producer killed off the stereotype of action movies. It's quality over quantity in this one and I'm very pleased to have watched it. I hope all other action movies that releases in the future will be as interesting as this one.<br/><br/>If you want to have a movie night with your family or friends I suggest this one without any doubt. It has everything in it; the hot guy (how old is Jake now again 'cause you can't tell by that gorgeous face), the pretty girl, the golden story, the perfect ending you wouldn't be able to guess and of course some of that physical action you expected from watching the trailer. I won't give it a 10 because I've seen better movies but I'll still give it 8 for not letting me down and being worth my time. Not a single second of my night was wasted and time well spent is exactly what this movie is about, right?"
"sddavis63","9","0","1","5 December 2011"," An Excellent And Exciting Movie That Did Leave Me A Bit Confused
","I really liked this movie. That's the first thing that needs to be said. The premise is interesting, the story is exciting and the characters are believable (in a sci-fi sort of way) and as a result likable. Jake Gyllenhaal put on an excellent performance in the leading role as Capt. Colter Stevens - a US Air Force pilot who, as the movie opens, mysteriously finds himself not in Afghanistan where he was posted but on a commuter train heading into Chicago - and in someone else's body and life. Gyllenhaal was superb in this role. He literally held the movie together. There were very few scenes in which he wasn't front and centre, so if his performance had been anything less than superb the whole movie would have suffered, but he made this work. We discover pretty soon that something bad is going to happen on this train, and as the story unfolds we learn that Stevens is being used in an experiment called ""Source Code"" that allows him to experience the last few minutes of someone else's life. The authorities have discovered that there's a series of terrorist bombings planned in Chicago, and in an attempt to thwart them sends Stevens into the last 8 minutes of the life of someone who died on the train in the first of the explosions. Stevens' mission is to figure out who the bomber is, and to do that he keeps being sent back in after his 8 minutes are up to relive the whole time over and over again until he pieces enough together to reveal the bomber's identity.<br/><br/>It's an interesting premise - and it's a good mystery. There was nothing especially that gave away the bomber's identity until it was revealed. It could have been anyone on the train, which is part of Stevens' challenge. Gyllenhaal was teamed with a pretty solid cast. I really liked Michelle Monaghan as Christine - the almost girlfriend of the guy whose life Stevens is thrown into. She did a great job in the part, confused by Stevens' confusion (because he knows nothing about the man's life) but obviously caring about him. Until the end, the temptation to get these two together as a couple was largely left alone, and when it did happen at the end, it was kind of a nice, feel-good ending to a troubling premise that I don't want to say too much about in a review. Vera Farmiga as the Air Force officer who's Stevens' basic contact with the outside world was solid as her character develops an increasing sympathy for Stevens' plight and Jeffrey Wright - while good - came across as a bit of a stereotypical scientist more concerned about his experiments than about how they'll affect others.<br/><br/>I had a bit of confusion over some elements of the plot. I understand that Stevens was being sent to live the last 8 minutes of this person's life, based on the premise that a person's brain lives on for a few minutes after the body dies. OK, but I wondered how they would have been able to access this man's brain memory (for lack of any other way to describe it) since he surely would have been dead longer than that by the time they pulled him out of the wrecked train? I also wondered how Stevens, once in this man's brain memory could do anything other than what the man had done, or could know anything other than what the man knew. Wouldn't his experience be completely dependent on the deceased man's memory and experience? Confusing - to me at least. Otherwise, I thought this was an excellent and exciting movie."

","I was skeptical. Time loops have been explored very well in many Star Trek episodes through the years, and I expected some commercialized version, with loud action and little drama.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is about trying to find a terrorist on board a train. Gyllenhaal plays a military helicopter pilot killed in action. They hook him up to an advanced sci-fi machine enabling them to put him into the mind of one of the passengers for 8 minutes before a bomb destroys the train. His task is to find the terrorist. It is very exciting.<br/><br/>Very early on, I felt the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. Love always gets to you. I was full of wonder. It is like the most incredible thing you could imagine. To live 8 minutes over and over, and being able to connect with people. Tell them what you really want to tell them. Make them happy. Especially a girl you really like. This is what makes the whole movie tick. It reminded me of Groundhog day. There was the same sense that I am being told something very important here.<br/><br/>While I was watching, I was thinking about my own life. How do I spend my time? The thought came to me that life is like a source code, and every moment is a chance to do something good.. Only thing is that we only have one chance. Because moments go by. But there is this beautiful song by the late Norwegian song writer, Alf Proysen, saying that tomorrow is a new day with blank pages and thumbtacks.<br/><br/>I don't have to say much more about the movie.It spoils everything if you haven't seen it. Just to say that the main character is a good guy, and he gets close to at least 3 people during the movie. It all helps to suck us into the drama and the suspense.<br/><br/>I can safely say this movie made my day better."

","""I took your advice it's a very good advice"", is the first words that you will hear over and over again. I always love the good movie which could generate debate and controversy among viewers. Considering all of the twists and turns, thiz is one of those. The opening scene brings us to Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up in a train. Afterwards, in front of him, a beautiful girl named Christina (Michelle Monaghan) talks to him, some detailed events, such as: the soda water splashes to his shoes, the train conductor checks up his ticket and some more, and ends up exactly 8 minutes later when the train is exploded! And then again Stevens wakes up in a capsule in the name of Beleaguered Castle, where he meets project administrator Lt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) along with the creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). That is the first piece of our puzzle, afterwards we will be gathering piece by piece of the mystery that takes us to the new masterpiece. Gyllenhaal shows his star quality here, he can deliver the leading role very well, his confusion and integrated expression successfully brings us up and down through the story. Farmiga brings her potential talent to the maximum by delivering her investigating expression, and she looks gorgeous like always. And finally Monaghan is a good sweetener for the story. But once again the power of thiz movie is coming from the well-built story itself, promising at the first, mind-blowing for the end. It's a pure classic thriller with futuristic details, brought up by rising-up Director Duncan Jones who directed highly respected thriller "" Moon"" (2009). Although there are some same repeating scenes over and over again, the storyline is actually very dynamic. After three quarters of the film, we still don't have a clue where is thiz movie going to take us. The most interesting part of thiz movie is: well, you know thiz movie brought up 'Quantum Theory' to explain things that happened. It easily reminds us of the famous 90's TV Series ""Quantum Leap"" (1989-1993), where Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) was always told to wake up in different body in every episode. Guess what? Bakula appears as a Cameo in thiz movie, although it's only his voice as Stevens's father when he speaks over the phone. And Guess what again? Some things will never change, Bakula starts the conversation with his famous line,""Oh, Boy!.."". If you didn't even realize that, I think you should see it all over again.

Even though I had to see this movie.<br/><br/>Jake wakes up in a train, after eight minutes everyone dies in the train due to a bomb explosion. Jake wakes up in a capsule. He's connected to an experiment called source code. The government can get him back into the train into the body of someone else, just for eight minutes, over and over again, to find out where the bomb is hidden and who the person is behind this act of cruelty.<br/><br/>Now, that is a formula of a good movie isn't it? Besides of getting the feeling that you're watching groundhog day, you also want to learn more of what the situation is where Jake is captured in. Jake talks to the man who has created this source code and with a lot of science-alike blablabla you have to believe of what this man is saying, that is the reality. Well, there this movie lost me because I only heard a lot of crap that did not make any sense, ave the movie a second chance and watched the movie further. You get to see the situation where Jake really is in and that is not pretty. You know that it does not matter in which direction the story goes, you will never be satisfied as a viewer. And that really is the feeling I was left when the movie was over.<br/><br/>Some people say it gives you stuff tot think about, but this ain't Inception.

","In Hollywood industry, science-fiction often means E.T., robots and laser sabers.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" reaches a higher standard, and achieves to blend the paranoid matters of Philip K. Dick (altered consciousness, parallel realities) with the sensible depiction of human emotions.<br/><br/>""Moon"", Duncan Jones' previous movie was already illustrating the interest of the director for 'hard' science-fiction, as well as the reflections around self-consciousness, death, reincarnation, free will, love. In his second film, Duncan Jones gives his characters a new dimension : the characters really stands, with more profound personalities. There is a better balance between the science-fiction plot and the emotional plot. To support this idea of a 2-axis film, it is interesting to observe that ""Source Code"" has two endings : the climax of the human emotions (son-father relation, and love), followed by the termination of science-fiction machine.<br/><br/>Technically, ""Source Code"" is very good. The special effects are not overly present, and are serving the film purpose well. Nevertheless, the art direction is rather impersonal and it would be difficult to identify the film by its photography only. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting well (much better than in Brokeback Montain) and the supporting actresses (Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga) are convincing.<br/><br/>This was a very enjoyable movie, and I am looking forward for Jones' next movie. Will it be a new SF film? Will it be possible to find new dickian themes to explore? I sincerely hope so."

If you enjoy science fiction for with ethical and character issues then this is a good movie for you. Though it could have been more of a mystery or thriller style movie, the focus really is on how Gyllenhaal's character develops rather than the dramatic situation. Sometimes the next step or plot event that progresses the movie feels too easy and in once case contrived. Don't expect a lot of action despite frequent explosions.

","Jake Gyllenhaal stars in a new mind-bending thriller about a former soldier from Afghanistan who goes on a mission through a source code program that lets him go back in previous events in his own alternate universe, only this time, he has to prevent a dangerous terrorist bomb in a train ride. Throughout the movie, he always has to go back and forth to the same location, from finding the bomb in the train, to the identity of the bomber, over and over. ""Source Code"" is exhilarating, and entertainingly thrilling, and it's one of the best movies this year so far. Jake Gyllenhaal brings one of the best performances of the year with his charisma and sense of realism. Michelle Monaghan makes an excellent portrayal, and Vera Farmiga did an excellent job in the movie as well. Duncan Jones did a magnificent directing duty, and brought a movie this year that blew me away. The film editing is so awesome, because it happens so unexpectedly. The cinematography is superb, the music is thrilling, and the visual effects are like no other I have ever seen before. But the only problem with this movie is that it was 93 minutes too quick, and it looked like a movie that people would usually spent 2 hours watching, and that was unexpected. The rest of ""Source Code"" is crystal-clear perfect! If you enjoy watching thrillers that mess with your mind, go see ""Source Code"".

"themovingpic","8","0","2","9 October 2011"," Thrilling and engaging!
","Source Code begins by jumping right into the action which was an excellent approach to starting off the film; it kept the audiences' attention and at the edge of their seats. Instantaneously the viewers were filled with questions and assumptions as to the identity of the bomber. We are first introduced to Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on the train confused and disoriented and seated across from Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). From then on it jumps back and forth from the real world to the 'source code' where Jake's character fights to not only find clues about the bomber, but as to how and why he was put on this mission. Coming into the theater I assumed that the film would only focus on locating the bomber but the film is given several layers such as Colter Stevens' history in the military and the relationship that progresses between him and Christina Warren. Ultimately what drives Jake's character is saving Christina and the other passengers on the train, but it is, at the beginning of the film, made clear that the source code is a shadow and a glimpse into eight minutes and therefore impossible to alter the past.<br/><br/>The director and writers did a great job in developing the storyline and the characters. I had fears that the film would become repetitive since Jake's character had to keep going back into the source code and was only given eight minutes each time he entered; but every time he went in something different would transpire and the storyline would develop more and more. There were many twists and turns in the film that made it all the more exciting and engaging! And with an ending that will leave a clever smile across your face.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal as always entertained the audience on the big screen. The comedic moments he was given in the film is the Jake-like-humor we LOVE seeing in other films such as Love and Other Drugs. When he needed to be intense and extreme he delivered; when he needed to be funny or compassionate he was proficient in doing so! This film was exhilarating, thrilling and mind boggling! It is fresh and different from any other thriller I've seen. Some may compare it to Christopher Nolan's Inception but it's a different take on the use and capabilities of the mind."

Add Michelle Monaghan, so underrated and still gorgeous, and it turned out even better.<br/><br/>It's great that syntax of time was not adhered to as relevant, that the story, however small, changes. And to end the way it did, not the alter-reality, but to make everyone laugh ... that is awesome. And the music works here best. Music matters a lot, and I found the dramatic unwarranted. The story had more depth than that, but just at that point, at about the 1:18:15 mark, with all that laughing. This is really beautiful. The alter-reality music is OK, but the rest, unfortunately, is pretty unremarkable. Shame. <br/><br/>Still, a great, well-executed story. I read somewhere that Jake was over-acting. Seriously, what would you be doing if you were on a train and the last thing you remember was trying to fly a helicopter? He did a good job. And Vera Farmiga was good, too. It's tough to be human in the military.<br/><br/>Fine job."

On one hand, he always overacts–those blue eyes widen, his mouth slightly opens and the camera pans in for a close-up of Jake Gyllenhaal reacting to something. On the other hand, however, he possesses an intensity that is almost (but not quite) there that keeps me hoping all the time that he will make that leap from moderately-good technician to good actor--a leap which he hasn't managed to make yet.<br/><br/>I've seen him in quite a few movies now, and I am of the opinion that he doesn't allow himself to be free when he acts.

","Source Code is a rare kind of a film nowadays. A techno-thriller with brains and soul. No easy task, but apparently not a first for director Duncan Jones whose previous film Moon (which I did not see yet) has a large number of fans. This second full feature film establishes him as one of the most interesting directors in a genre which is not lacking opportunities in Hollywood, it is missing exactly the intellectual quality and the emotions that he is bringing on the set.<br/><br/>The main hero of the story is a US officer fighting in Afghanistan who wakes up in a train speeding to Chicago in the company of an attractive young woman and soon realizes that his identity and appearance have changed. A few minutes later the train explodes in a terror attack, and he wakes up in his own skin in the constrained space of what looks like a space capsule, to be briefed and learn that he has just lived the last eight minutes in the life of another person. By means of a combination of quantum physics and computer engineering he will be able to return several times in the speeding train and re-live the same events accumulating the knowledge from the previous instances, in alternate runs of the reality, with the goal of finding the terrorist and preventing a second much more damaging attack. Inevitably he will fall in love with the young woman in front of him and tray to save her life and the lives of the other people in the train. It is just that succeeding would actually sliding in a different reality or a parallel universe, name it as you wish.<br/><br/>Science in movies would almost in all cases fail you in technical universities exams, and the one in Source Code would probably not rank better if put under academic scrutiny. It has however two qualities that are important for the film - they allow for the repetition in a constrained space which provides the unity of space and time so dear to writers of good story since the Greek tragedies, and it is exposed gradually and learned by the main hero at the same time as the viewer, which helps us identify with the dilemmas and emotions of the character. Jake Gyllenhaal is an excellent choice for the role and all the other characters support him like a web threaded around his fight against the time to discover the truth and the moral and emotional choice that he makes in the final. A well made film, not too long, not too expensive (but not lacking a few spectacular moments), smart and sensible. One of a rare kind nowadays, did I already say it?"

Writer/director should have done a little homework by consulting with ANYONE in Chicago about the train or just gone online and checked with Metra.

","Source Code can be easily said to be the best movie I have ever seen. Some movies are meant to be cherished ,experienced and enjoyed , questioning the concepts they use is irrelevant, story telling is a space where one has freedom to let open the doors of imagination . Source Code is one such film , it showcases Science fiction in a never before seen avatar , and that is what makes this movie one hell of a ride. Another thing which would amaze you is the fact that despite being a science fiction movie this movie shows a beautiful love story too.

","In watching the Trailers and reading about Source Code, this is a movie that fulfils every expectations you have of it. It doesn't try to be something it isn't and it is very entertaining simply enough. Sometimes a film can misrepresent itself in trailers but Source Code is exactly what it explains to be and unfolds at breakneck speed and will not disappoint for even a moment. Even the ending, where they could have stumbled ends perfectly for anyone. The lead performance in the film is a Hollywood star and he carries the film flawlessly. The film adds action intrigue and a whole of thrilling elements to the story which is certainly science fiction but a good solid action movie as well. The story is interesting and full of plenty of twists. It reminded me a lot of perhaps a Phillip Dick story in the same vein as Paycheck, or Minority Report although maybe a little more mainstream and subtle than perhaps those were in the genre. This film was made to entertain and it does and it might not be an amazing piece of film making artistically it does what movies are meant to do and that is entertain.<br/><br/>I like Jake Gyllenhaal. He's the perfect Hollywood star. He has this intensity and he also has this 'guy next door' feel to him. He has done some really terrific roles and handles mainstream films like this easily because he is charismatic but his role in this film also requires some great intensity so as I mentioned he flawlessly and effortlessly carries this movie. Every time I see Michelle Monaghan in a film, I think the same thing. She's cute. She's always been decent in her roles but I've never seen anything she's done that really stands out and she is just cute. You want to pinch her cheeks and like Gyllenhaal she has a very 'next door' feel to her. Her and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry, it isn't mind blowing but it carries the film well enough. I do feel she could have been a little better in the role but she still does well. Vera Farmiga is good in a subtly intense role as the person directing Gyllenhaal to try and stop a disaster. She isn't right on the forefront but as a supporting character she is really good. Same could be said but on a small scale for supporting actors Jeffrey Wright, and Michael Arden who are good but don't really stand out in the film.<br/><br/>Oddly enough the director of this film bucks my usual theory of directors with very few credits to their name tend to ruin a good story. Duncan Jones has very little big screen credits to his name but that doesn't stop him from making a captivating story. I think he's probably lucky to get really good actors and a solid story. Not that he isn't good from his own talent, in fact there are some really well put together scenes especially when Gyllenhaal is back in the future and inside the machine that transports him. Source Code is the perfect Saturday night flick to watch. It will entertain, and get you excited and give you a good solid story and anyone can enjoy it. It's the type of sci-fi flick that doesn't cater to just those fans. Source Code will be enjoyed by anyone. I definitely recommend! 8/10 <br/><br/>***Support your video stores!!

","Source Code (2011) directed by Duncan Jones (moon), written by Ben Ripley. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farminga and Jeffrey Wright.<br/><br/>Now let me start by saying that I had no idea what I was going to get when I saw this film. Was it going to be a mindless thriller-action film, or was it going to be much smarter than that. To be far it's very smart (even though the IMDb list it as an action film, it's actually low on action but that doesn't matter), but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>The plot basically involves a young man named Colter Stevens (played by Gyllenhaal) who awakens on a train and discovers that he is living the identity of a school teacher. The person sitting next to him named Christina (played okay by Michelle Monaghan) thinks he's crazy when he tells her that the train is going to explode. The explosion happens and Stevens wakes up in the cockpit where he meets air force captain Colleen Goodwin (played by Vera Farminga), who informs him he is inside the Source Code, which is an experimental device created by Dr. Rutledge (played by Jeffrey Wright). This device allows a person to experience the last eight minutes of somebody else's life. Stevens is informed by Goodwin that he can not change the past and save the lives of the people on the train in his own time, but if he can identify the bomber in the alternate time line millions of people will be saved. As such Stevens enters the train to find out who the bomber really is.<br/><br/>Source Code is a very well done film. The directing by Duncan Jones (who also made the masterpiece moon) is first rate. The script by Ben Ripley is extremely crafty. The acting is mostly good (especially Jeffrey Wright who I think gives the best performance in the film, as a somewhat crazed doctor).<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>PS: Anyone find it weird that Russell Peters is in this film."

","In the not-at-all-distant future, the US military runs a trial of their new take on time travel. Through a loosely-explained implementation of cutting edge technology, they're able to insert an unwitting agent into the near past, where he then relives the eight minutes immediately preceding a terrorist attack over and over again, desperately seeking suspects and answers. I'm typically a big fan of this style of high-concept science fiction flicks, and for the great majority of its running time, Source Code manages to continuously one-up itself in that respect. The film doesn't shy away from delivering powerful, surprising answers as events play themselves out, while a deep, complex script ensures there's always a new mystery to pick up where the last one left off. With that nice juicy carrot always dangling just out of reach and a breakneck pace from start to finish, this plays more like an intense, brilliant short film and not the feature-length offering it actually is. Though an awkward, mismatched happy ending does sour things to a certain extent, the sharp curves it navigates before running into that brick wall won't easily be forgotten."

","In Manhattan I watched Source Code, a science fiction thriller which stars Jake Gyllehall who is in a race against time to prevent terrorism and to alter his own fate.<br/><br/>Picture Groundhog Day meets Inception, Source code is a pulse pounding thriller involving a commuter train headed to Chicago with a bomb on board. Captain Colter Stevens played by Jake Gyllenhall is a soldier but wakes up in the body of a school teacher on that train. The science explained in the movie may not be true but it does not matter as the story of a man who tries to change the past succeeds.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Duncan Jones, Source Code which is a government experiment enables Stevens to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. The source code program allows Stevens to go back to the last 8 minutes time and time again with his mission to find the bomb and bomber. Each time Stevens relives the incident he gathers more clues and begins to fall for Christina played by Michelle Monaghan.<br/><br/>I watched the movie in Times Square with two friends in a large theater but with a small audience. There was little wait time to purchase my tickets and to walk to my theater seat. Arriving ten minutes early allowed me to view commercials and advertising up until the start time of the movie. Then at the start time there were at least six trailer previews followed by more advertising before the movie started. As an avid movie goer I do not mind the extensive movie trailers and they actually make me more excited for the movie. The audience was generally quiet throughout as the movie required you to concentrate on the clues that Stevens was finding on the train each time he went back in the train for eight minutes.<br/><br/>Source Code is based on the idea that Sean Fentress, a school teacher on the train who dies when a bomb explodes is compatible with Stevens who can cross into Sean Fentress's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. The government program source code is used because the bomb on this train is only a warning act of terrorism and that a more powerful bomb is planned for the city of Chicago. The second attack is imminent so Stevens is sent back again and again despite not knowing what he is doing and if his father has been notified. Source Code still keeps the human story whilst providing entertaining action. The acting and casting is excellent and it leaves the viewer with satisfaction and intrigue after a running time of 93 minutes. I strongly recommend this film as it works as an emotional, and intelligent gripping story."

","Source Code is a very cool sci-fi action/drama from Duncan Jones.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as a harried, confused man who eventually finds focus and purpose in what he's been tasked to do. <br/><br/>You don't have to be a hardcore sci-fi fan to enjoy this, as it's grounded in the real world in a way that makes it very easily accessible.

","Jake Gyllenhaal stars in ""Source Code"", a science fiction time-travel thriller directed by Duncan Jones. A bomb explosion occurs on a Chicago train that derails the locomotive and in turn kills hundreds of people. In an attempt to identify the bomber and prevent another, larger attack on downtown Chicago, Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is forced to encompass the body of one of the passengers during the eight minutes before the man is killed. However, during his first trip back, Captain Stevens fails to gather enough clues to prevent the second bomb attack. With time quickly running out, he must repeat the mission again and again in a desperate race to head off one of the deadliest terrorist attacks ever. ""Source Code"", a follow-up film by director Duncan Jones, who made his directorial debut in ""Moon"", truly shined after receiving a much larger budget to go to every length for this spectacular film. Far from turning into another Michael Bay, Jones still manages to create this movie from the same roots as his independent film ""Moon"". While it may not be as thought-provoking as ""Inception"" or ""Memoriam"", this isn't simply another mindless action blockbuster. The plot is much more intricate than it may appear, creating an in-depth film that the average moviegoer can easily immerse themselves in. Jake Gyllenhaal has starred in varying roles throughout his career, whether it be in the unforgettable cult favorite ""Donnie Darko"", the controversial film ""Brokeback Mountain"" or a simple romantic comedy like ""Love and Other Drugs"", Gyllenhaal has always been able to reveal another side of his acting range in his movies. In ""Source Code"" he is portrayed as a confident action hero, while still possessing the heart and desperation of a man locked in time. The supporting actors Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright also carry the film well in their respective roles. Monaghan and Gyllenhaal have great chemistry together, making their characters' emotions seem realistic and believable. This movie is a groundbreaking and heart-pounding thrill ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The script is brilliant, with easy to follow dialogue, characters that you can invest in yourself in and a storyline that constantly takes an unexpected turn. Although the beginning is slightly repetitive and reminiscent of ""Deja Vu"", the movie soon finds its footing and breaks into the underlying plot. Try to catch this movie before it leaves theaters–it's a ride you won't want to miss."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens to find himself on a commuter train, opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who claims to know him well, but who he can't remember. Shortly after, the train explodes, killing everyone on board except Colter, who wakes in a pod like chamber where he appears to be under the control of a mysterious organisation. He learns he is virtually brain dead, but the small part of his brain that's still alive (like the inside of a light bulb after it's been switched off) is being used to go back in time and stop a terrorist attack taking place.<br/><br/>It seems if Hollywood isn't relying these days on resurrecting old franchises with a loyal fan base to make easy money, it's throwing up the most obscure, far fetched ideas to a modern audience that probably likes to challenge itself, with films such as Inception and this rather less complicated but still far flung and vaguely nonsensical tale that is all too much to take in at first glance.<br/><br/>Still, it pays to stick with it, since it does generate an air of mystery and even a bit of suspense as it goes on, even if some of the character motivations do seem as slightly ridiculous as the story itself. You could be more critical and call it an absolute nonsense, but it's just too intelligently done to fall under this category. And despite lacking in humour through out, there is an optimistic, happy ending that results in quite a nice pay off. It would just be nice if Hollywood films weren't aiming for quite so much of the grey matter these days. ***"

Duncon Jones has tried to direct it with efficiency but it don't stand to the level it should have gone with the brilliancy in concept. At one point of time I started feeling bored with the repetition of things and going through the same thing again and again without any limit. This is the same thing that happened with Vantage Point. The movie is very good despite of all the facts but it could have gone par limits. Climax will be quite surprising for everyone I guess. But there is no such thing like repeated viewings to understand. The climax was amateur and is left to be on the viewer's interpretation. But it's not at all done with the elegance it was left in Inception for example.

There are some strange interactions with a few passengers, he being confused about the situation, until a great explosion takes out the train plus the one traveling next to it. <br/><br/>Colter is unharmed, because he wasn't actually on the train but into the consciousness of a man who had been on that train. He has been sent there with one mission, to figure out who the bomber is because they are expecting him to strike again shortly, with a bomb into Chicago that will take out part of the city and a lot of lives. <br/><br/>While the first few minutes is pretty confusing, until you realize what is going on, ultimately the story makes sense and has a resolution that was not anticipated by the scientists controlling the experiment. <br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan is of course good as Christina Warren, the young woman Colter finds himself on the train with. As is Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin, the lady in the lab communication with Colter.

Competing for his attention are his own questions about what happened to him, finally finding out he himself was reported dead in action. But, badly injured with only a part of his body left, he still had brain activity and was in the experiment. He formed the theory that the technology could also save the passengers, but alive in an alternate existence. He wanted to save and be with the girl. After he found the bomber, Michael Arden as Derek Frost, his alternate consciousness was able to send a text message to Goodwin, so she knew that the now saved train passengers were alive in the alternate existence, now that he prevented the train explosions."

","So far, 2011 has been a mixed year. There have been fantastic films, like Tree of Life and some pretty bad films too like Battle:Los Angeles.

Duncan Jones(director of the wonderful Moon) does a superb job directing, and the film looks great with atmospheric cinematography and lighting. The writing is outstanding, thoughtful with the odd bit of droll humour and the issues of loss and responsibility give it some emotional weight as well, and the story benefits from an interesting idea, is compelling and has enough suspense and tautness to satisfy. The acting is great, Jake Gyllanhaal balances vulnerability and muscle-bound action expertly. Jeffrey Wright tries a little too hard, but Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga are solid as rocks.

The true problem here is the great resemblance of the plot with Deja Vu, the movie with Denzel Washington (who was way better in my opinion) - the components are completely the same, even down to the pathetic mechanics of the machine, that allows time travel or passage between plains of existence, dimensions or whatever you like to call it.

He has been put in the mind of one of the passengers. The train is going to blow up, and the terrorist is going to blow up another venue in Chicago later in the day and kill even more people. His assignment is to find out who the bomber is so that the government can stop the second bombing.<br/><br/>Stevens is sent back as the train passenger over and over, unable to get information on the bomber's identity. He falls for his traveling companion (Monaghan) and becomes determined to stop the first bombing so that she and the other passengers will not be killed. He is told, however, that he has not gone back in time and cannot change what has already happened.<br/><br/>Fascinating film that takes the theories behind quantum physics and pushes them into the realm of science fiction - though scientists are actually studying some of the ideas put forth in the movie.<br/><br/>As Stevens, Jake Gyllenhaal does a terrific job as a confused man who is having trouble with the different realities he is thrust into; Vera Farmiga is very good as the person running the experiment, who bonds with Stevens, seeing him as a human being instead of an experiment. Michelle Monaghan resembles a young version of the actress Terry Farrell (and I remember when she was young) and is very good as the passenger's traveling companion.<br/><br/>The end is thought-provoking and asks just what science will be able to accomplish as the years go on.

After his amazing directional debut with Moon i taught how could he ever top that but i was wrong because he does so and does it very well. Source code has everything you want in a science fiction thriller. It has the time line that keeps the audience on the edge of their sit. It then incorporates time travel in a way that hasn't been done before. Jake Gyllenhall(zodiac,Donnie darko) does what he does best and carries the film which is needed for the audience to believe this movie, they have to root for his character. The icing on the cake for this movie is that with all the explosions and CGI going on underneath it all is a love story which the audience can connect with. This a brilliant way of not letting the audience question the characters decisions as everyone can relate to bad relationships with fathers and falling in love. This is not the last we have seen of Duncan James he is one to watch out for in the coming years."

If I can give this movie props it has a original story like no other a Army pilot goes back in time to find the bomber of a train but he can only go back for eight minutes at a time before he has to restart the whole thing over again.<br/><br/>This plot keeps you guessing the entire time on what has happened to Colter Stevens (Jake), and what is the bombers plan and why. Now you can probably guess who the bomber is in the first five minutes just by film cliché but that is not really the true mystery the mystery is where is Stevens and how can he go back in time. His love interest in this film is Michelle Monaghan and she is hot plus they really seem to have chemistry together. This is an exciting story from the begging to the end. Now saying that the ending does have the sappy ending but honestly you do just want to see this character be happy.<br/><br/>The motto of this film is ""Make every second count"" and that is what they did in this film it is truly a must see.

It is where a person is implanted into the thoughts of an already dead person for the last 8 minutes of their life in order to find out something of critical importance. In this case, it is to find an explosives expert who bombed a train killing everyone on board before they bomb another area in the epicenter of Chicago where millions of people reside.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Capt. Colter Stevens, who's the man inside the Source Code trying to figure out who the killer is before he kills again. Michelle Monaghan is lovable as her character plays the 'love interest' in a way of Gyllenhaal.

In short, Colter must change the past to save the future.<br/><br/>Is it just me, or whenever you see a train in a suspenseful movie, do you think Hitchcock? The movie begins with a sweeping aerial shot of Chicago and some very Hitch-style music in the background. The director may get a bit of a criticism for this. It seems these days, everyone borrows from Hitchcock. I think if you are going to be influenced by someone, why not be influenced by the great auteur? Especially if you are given a script where a lot of the action takes place on a train. As a filmmaker, you must be practically compelled to give a nod to Hitchcock. See it not as rip–off but as a homage.<br/><br/>""It's the same train but different."" (Colter Stevens)<br/><br/>When you have repeat scenarios in a movie, they can seem dull and repetitive, and it is very hard to show the same set-up over and over again while managing to make it fresh and interesting. However, Source Code Director, Duncan Jones, and writer, Ben Ripley, have used humour and character to make the film seem fresh and interesting, and have also kept the running time to just over 90 minutes, so that the repeat scenario is not too laboured<br/><br/>In a quirky aside, Duncan Jones, the director, must really love Chesney Hawkes. In Moon, Duncan Jones' directorial debut, he used the One and Only, - Chesney Hawkes one-hit-wonder- as the alarm music, and in this film, he uses the song as Christina Warren's (Michelle Monaghan) ring-tone for an ex-boyfriend. You would think the son of David Bowie would have more high-brow musical tastes. However, this song does fit on both occasions and hammers home what the director is trying to say – if the song makes it into his third film, this might just be his trademark. Also, near the beginning of the movie, I noticed that Jake Gyllenhaal looks in the mirror and sees another face staring back at him. This screams Quantum Leap. So, it was nice to see the director acknowledging this by giving Scott Bakula a brief, but important, cameo. I like directors making little personal touches like this, it gives something for us movie geeks to talk about and it suggests to me that a director is not just making a film for a paycheck but it is more a labour of love.<br/><br/>The cast are all superb: Michelle Monaghan gives warmth and a personality to a character that is basically incidental; Jeffrey Wright is suitably callous as an ""end justifies the means"" villain; and Vera Farmiga plays Colleen Goodwin, with just the right amount of stoic pathos to make you like her. But above all, Jake Gyllenhaal shines in this movie. He is beginning to garner a reputation as an actor whose movies are a cut above the rest of the usual tripe that floods the cinemas. Prince of Persia is, of course, the exception that proves the rule.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie a sense of doom hangs over Colter Stevens and everyone else on the train. However, the movie does not end as you would expect, and after it is over, you will either love the ending or hate it. Some people will think it is too complicated and others will blast it for being a bit of a cop-out. It is an ending that will pique your interest and give you a chance to develop your own theory as to what actually happened. It is not Inception complicated, as some people are claiming. You may need a second watch to really grasp what was going on, but that would be about it.<br/><br/>""Everything's gonna' be okay."" Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan)<br/><br/>If you like a bit of J.J. Abrams Fringe, you will like Source Code. If you have a doctorate in physics, you may scoff at the idea of it, but as far as I am concerned, Source Code ticks all the boxes as Sci-Fi actioners go. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It has wit, personality, breath-taking action sequences and an ending that you will probably want to chat to your friends about. What more do you want? Grab yourself some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, then sit back, relax and enjoy."

When one character he never chose to pick a fight was a man wearing sunglasses, having a computer and phone, a view of on coming train and a very aggressive personality. <br/><br/>After only his third time back he gives up and spends the time trying to get in contact with himself, his dad and finding out what unit he is working for. When he does eventually put effort in he gets it all straight away as he would of from the start. The bomb fiasco only gets about 25mins of the movie. <br/><br/>This could have been a very good film if they just stayed basic and kept it a mystery thriller, however, romances, trying to explain the science too much, relationships with Goodwin & co., relationships with his dad, why, and why so long??, make this a bad story and only for the good performance from Gyllenhall is it not a 2 or 3."

","The film was fun in it's jumping back and forth between the different attempts to find the bomb and surprisingly it doesn't feel repetitive because every time is different and they haven't put in too many attempts.<br/><br/>The thing that bugs me about this film is that even though it opens up a lot of questions about quantum mechanics and parallel realities it doesn't leave you thinking for days after, like Inception or Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>Another Annoyance is that the film doesn't really get interesting or exciting as he can't ultimately die and at the end everybody's happy with nothing wrong and their the story ends. The film doesn't develop any excitement or any real story. I watched it mainly to pass the time and it felt like a short film even though it was about 90 minutes.<br/><br/>No cliffhangers either which makes you forget about all the characters personal issues and adventures and future attempts to save the world.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film as a way to pass the time but I wouldn't bother paying to see it in a cinema, more watch it at a friends house or with a girlfriend."

","Source is a futuristic thriller, although it may bear its similarities with the Minority Report movie, though it is nothing like it. It's a very creative movie that starts a bit slow but picks it pace later on in the movie and the ride only gets more enjoyful from that point on.<br/><br/>Captain Colter Stevens is a solider that finds himself being trapped into a cube shaped device, which people refer to as the ""Source Code"", the easiest way to understand the ""Source Code"" is, it's a device created for the good of man kind, that lets you travel into a parallel universe and lets you see things and determine its outcome, for instance in the movie Captain Colter finds himself in a train that is about to blow up in about 8 minutes, what he has to do in those 8 minutes is to search for the bomb, track down who might have put it and search everyone through the train and has infinite amount of tries to find that out.<br/><br/>Telling you more about the story would be giving too much away from the plot that serves as a thrill of its own and a twist in the end itself. It's a very enjoyful ride if you can get past the story driven the first 30 minutes of the movie. It's a must check out for the sci-fi fans and futuristic thrillers, if you liked the movies like Inception, Minority Report & Sunshine than this movie must be right up your ally to watch.<br/><br/>I would give it a 7 stars out of 10.

Goodwin tells Colter that his brain has been kept active in order to put him on a super secret mission that he's not expected to come out alive from! Since he's not really alive, Colter is on life-support, to being with in the first place that fact doesn't seem to bother him! <br/><br/>This mission that he's in no condition to reject is to become Sean Fentress and prevent the detonation of a nuclear device in downtown Chicago. The train that Colter is on now he's told by Goodwin and her boss Dr. Rutledge, Jeffery Wright, is already gone together with the some 200 or so passengers on it! But Colter is given a window of opportunity to prevent that, the future Chicago nuclear explosion, from happening by him discovering and preventing the man who's to set it off in him using the train explosion as a diversion: An 8 minute time loop that was invented by the super secret project ""Beleaguered Castle"" that both Capt. Goodwin & Dr. Rutledge work for. Taking advantage of the time loop Colter can relive those critical 8 minutes as many times as he want's until he finally gets it right! In that way Colter can find out who placed the bomb on the train and thus prevent him from doing far greater damage in nuking the entire city of Chicago and end up killing hundreds of thousands if not as much as a million innocent people!<br/><br/>A real mind blowing like movie with Captain Colter Stevens going back and forth in time,the 8 minute time loop, about a half dozen times in order to find out who's responsible for the train explosion only to end up falling in love with Michelle and not only wanting to prevent the nuclear blast that's to level Chicago in the future but prevent the train explosion that already happened that ended up killing her! Being told by Capt.Goodwin & Dr. Rutledge that he can't change what already happened Colter still tries his best to do exactly that.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** To paraphrase a quote from a famous 1960's sci-fi TV series Colter in his determination to both go back and forth in time and change the outcome of both past and future events in the end ended up succeeding on both counts! What Colter in fact ended up doing was to participate in a great mind as well as time bending adventure.

But then he cannot have any other memories - he cannot see anything the deceased did not see. He cannot find a bomb in the bathroom which the deceased never saw. It just doesn't make sense.

"zetes","8","0","3","31 July 2011"," A fine sci-fi thriller
","Entertaining sci-fi thriller by Duncan Jones, whose debut film was the mind-bending Moon a couple of years ago. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a military man who is part of an experiment where he can enter the mind of a dead man for an eight minute span. He's made to do this by his superiors so he can scope for evidence in a crime, here the bombing of a train in Chicago. At first, Gyllenhaal is disoriented and does not understand his purpose. He becomes attached to a woman on the train (Michelle Monaghan), but, after those initial eight minutes, his superiors (Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright) inform him that everyone on that train has already died, that he cannot change that, and that his only purpose on this mission is to figure out who is responsible so that the authorities can prevent a second terrorist attack. He goes back and re-lives those same eight minutes - and then he does it again and again. Much like in Moon, there are some major weaknesses in the story. In particular, it sets up rules that it pretty much ignores as it nears the end. And I was never quite as attached to Gyllenhaal's character as I was to Rockwell's in the previous film (though I will complement Gyllenhaal on a fine performance). But I still found the film very gripping and breathlessly paced. The plot may remind some of the television show Quantum Leap, as it must have Jones and company: he casts Scott Bakula in the role of Gyllenhaal's father (who is only heard on the phone). It was even more similar, in my mind, to the underrated 2006 film Deja Vu, which I might slightly prefer to Source Code even though, God forbid, it was directed by Tony Scott."

","With the name recognition of Jake Gyllenhaal and a few snazzy trailers thrown in, it was a sure thing I was going to watch this movie. I also like Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga I've already drooled over publicly in previous reviews so my bias here won't come as a shock. To the movie; I found it thrilling, exhausting, thrilling, exhausting, puzzling and exhausting, that's about it in a nutshell. Why? Because it's a science fiction thriller? Sure, that must be it, let's go with that; simplistic as it may sound the truth is usually that simple, we just like to read and hear more complicated explanations and if you're a CNN fan you want to hear the two-sided explanation over and over until you forget the logic and are satisfied with just remembering the spin. My 'anti-spin' is the following: <br/><br/>The IMDb full storyline pretty much outlines what goes on without of course the 'finale' which I will be just as much a bastard not to divulge. Now, the flic is more fiction than science as all sci-fi's are naturally. If you listen carefully to the explanation Dr. Rutledge, played by Jeffrey Wright, gives to Gyllenhaal who wants to know what is happening to him , you may, as I did, pretend to understand immediately Dr. Rutledge's meaningful illustration of the process Gyllenhaal is going through, whence much further reflexion was required to come up with the conclusion perhaps it may come true in the future when the human race has colonized another planet outside our galaxy, so to enjoy the movie you might as well just go with the flow.<br/><br/>I bit of romance for good measure! Gyllenhaal progressively falls for Monaghan, it would have been a commercial mistake not to go with this sub plot given how well it worked. No romantic tribulation for officer Goddwin played by Vera Farmiga; well none outside my own head.<br/><br/>As for the thriller aspect of the movie, that, I'm not afraid to state, is a successfully accomplished piece of work. The actors are very good at delivering their parts, something I always felt required a dose of talent to accomplish in sci-fi's and horror films. As with the movies ""Vantage Point"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Run Lola Run"", ""Memento"", ""Butterfly Effect"" and ""Primer"", one can't help but praise the patience of the actors, crew and the ballsy supervisory skills of the director as well as the talent of the editors. I liked it but I won't feel the need to see it again. If you usually avoid sci-fi's, you may not appreciate my recommending this movie, so you make your own decision. In my opinion, Gyllenhaal tends make Hollywood movies more palatable for those who are tired of them."

","I love SF movies. In this one, the premise of projecting someone's consciousness into a past event is interesting. They made clear in the beginning that the movie was not about time travel nor alternative reality, and all those people are really dead and nothing he does would change that. As an example, in one iteration, he took ""his"" girlfriend out of the train and even so she was dead at the end of the 8 minute period. So, what happened happened and there's no way to change it. OK, that's clear to me and then they've changed that.<br/><br/>The movie should have ended when the life support was turned off (well, but wasn't he dead already?) and everybody on the train has frozen in the last iteration. But no, they have to put a happy ending even if it doesn't make any sense at all. So, they come up with a alternative reality or something like that. I just can't buy it.<br/><br/>It's not about two realities but there is only one in which everybody in that train was dead. Jake's ""reality"" was just a projection, a simulation made by a software (hence the name source code, I guess) that is driving his mind (his brain waves) to that train. Everything happened inside Jake's mind. So, I don't see how he could've survived after the plug has been pulled. The only explanation is that they needed a happy ending badly and didn't care if it would make sense or not.<br/><br/>Too bad, because without this nonsense ending the movie would be so much better."

It was a fun, tense story and kept me wondering - and I was hoping for a good ending. Did I agree with the choice for the terrorist – I never agree with Hollywood's idea of who the real-world bad guys actually are. I don't think they ever do. Gee golly, Hollywood is so stuck in some weird politically correct world that never has anything to do with reality. My trivial whining and negativity now comes to an end. This story was so clever and well written. I know there is another story just like this, done somewhere, in a land far far away, but I cannot remember it, probably because it was not executed as well as this movie. Kudos to the acting well performed. Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga all did a super job and I could not stop cheering for their side to win. But! Jeffrey Wright – man that was such a good job. To play the villain so well, he did a super job. I wanted to reach out to the screen and smack him upside the head so bad.

Would recommend to all and probably watch again quite soon. Gyllenhaal is probably the only actor in the movie however that actually keeps the score moving along at an interesting pace and is also the only actor with any real talent that is believable. I feel that a stronger supporting cast along with another half hour or so added to the length and we would have a real strong film that merits a lot more.

Goodwin, along with project chief Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), go on to explain that through a time loop program known as the Source Code, Stevens is sent back in time, into the identity of Sean Fentress, a casualty on a train that was blown up. Knowing that he has only eight minutes before the bomb goes off, Stevens is repeatedly sent back until he figures out the terrorist. At this point, prepare for a plot twist that can only be truly appreciated by thinking outside the box. <br/><br/>Remember that weird kid from ""Donnie Darco""? Well, he's not a kid anymore and no longer weird. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jake Gyllenhaal in his first ever character driven role― a role that he sinks into, like a hot knife through butter. Not only does he do justice to the well written script, As Colter Stevens, his portrayal is so convincing you actually feel for his frustration in looking for answers; answers that are against his favor. Supporting him on either side is Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren and Farmiga as Goodwin. While both women play important roles in aiding the plot, each renders a heartwarming touch to Stevens' struggle in finding answers. Of the two, Farmiga's role has a very humanitarian touch towards the end while Monaghan's character becomes his object of survival. <br/><br/>This is a thinking man's movie. In comparison, ""Inception"" held its ground for the most part, then went overboard with the whole dream within a dream within a dream scenario. For that matter, ""Source Code"" has its moments with a puzzle within a puzzle. But it stops there and gives the audience a chance to think for themselves without overdoing it with road kill. What anchors the film is the intelligent screenplay by Ben Ripley, which also happens to be his first screenplay intended for a cinema production. Although the plot can also be compared to ""Vantage Point"" or ""Déjà vu"", Ripley's principal ideas are rife with originality. The concept behind the plot may be shocking for some, but agreeable by most is the fact that only a genius could have come up with such an example of time travel. Again, it is not time travel par se, but using the last few minutes of life before a clinically dead person becomes brain dead. You need to watch the movie to really understand that last line. <br/><br/>Onto Duncan Jones and I am all praises, given that this is only his second movie as a director. When I watched Jones' directional debut, ""Moon"", not only was I blown away, I saw a lot of promise for a young guy directing his first movie. If I may say so, I am happy to say that I was right in predicting wonders from this guy. Along with the aforementioned script and Gyllenhaal's acting, Jones' narration grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go until the end. Even then, I found myself starring at the screen as the credits rolled up. On one hand, the answers were coming to me, on the other, I was thinking 'absolutely amazing'. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. Like the icing on a cake, one little surprise is the guest appearance of a stand-up comedian who even gets asked ""what are you, a comedian?"" Priceless!"

","Ladies and Gentleman ... Duncan Jones .... once again.<br/><br/>After creating a beautiful movie like 'Moon' Duncan has done it again. Albeit the story wasn't written by him this time (Ben Ripley wrote it), his direction was just brilliant. A story like Source Code needed a director like him eh! and of course great actors like Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga. Jeffrey Wright, Michael Arden and Russell Peters did their bit in the flick.<br/><br/>Source code had more than a brilliant story to offer. It had both action and drama intermingled and must I say it proved to be a pretty good fest altogether. Jake Gyllenhaal is getting better day by day, whoa he was already good wasn't he since his teen years (Donnie Darko and October Sky still rule). With great movies like The Day after tomorrow, Brokeback mountain, Jarhead, Zodiac, Rendition, Brothers, Prince of Persia and Love and other drugs, he has another thriller to his name – Source Code where he Is the protagonist once again.<br/><br/>In the movie he poses as a soldier who wakes up to find himself a part of a mission wherein he is supposed to find a bomber who is going to strike again as is told to him by Vera Farmiga. Source Code enables him to take someone else's identity and revisit those 8 minutes just before the train is brought to splinters by the bomb. No matter how many times he dies he is supposed to find the bomber and the bomb. The question is can he do it? <br/><br/>Watch the flick for yourself because it's an action packed thriller which would definitely rivet you to your seats till the end. Some class acting by Jake, Michelle and Vera. A must watch. 8 on 10"

","What will you do if you had only a minute to live? I myself cannot zero my thoughts onto anything particular. It's a very smart question to know the answer to, don't you think? Colter Stevens, an US Army helicopter pilot wakes up to a beautiful Christina on a train heading towards downtown Chicago. Having no memory at all as to where he is or how he even came to be on that train, Stevens panics only find out that he is actually in the body of another person. 8 minutes is all he has to figure things out, when suddenly the train explodes and Colter Steven wakes up within a pod/chamber all fuzzy and confused. Whilst in a state of trance he is contacted by Captain Goodwin who tries to explain to him exactly what took place on the train. 8 Minutes is all he has to solve it all.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" an impressive piece of work I must say. Very very strenuous on your mind, it twists your ability of thinking quite far out with the cliffhanger in the end. A noteworthy script by Ben Ripley, this is the first thing that I wanted to find out once I was through the whole movie. Who was the man behind the script? It is a common practice that the writers are mostly over looked in respectable productions. It's always the director or the cast that gets most of the praise. I myself personally am guilty of being such. To bring an original idea of this degree to life and to see it all the way through as a box office hit is a great achievement on his part. All I can think of while I pen this down is how in the world he was inspired to write this all on his own. Very smart and innovative movie, although one may say it can be named similar to the likes of ""Inception"", I would disagree. Moving onto the directorial, nothing extravagant, pretty straight forward, however maybe the character development could have used a bit more attention. There is potential in the storyline to add more depth; however Duncan Jones does not seem to care much as he seems to be quite satisfied with how it's done. I would love to see more passion between Christina and Stevens, since everything builds based on the connection they have. However, Duncan Jones does capture most of the spirit and rides on the brilliance of the script with ease.<br/><br/>Vera Fermiga (The boy in the striped Pyjamas), Michelle Monaghan (Due Date) & Jake Gyllenhaal (Prince of Persia) dominates screen time and keeps the script mostly amongst them. Jake Gyllenhaal who has the lion's share of the work to do all on his own, does well and does not bore! Seems he has learnt since Prince of Persia. Monaghan and Fermiga side by side gives a good portrayal and since I am at liberty to choose, I prefer Fermigas' performance over Monaghan since she drew more emotion over the other. This is where I see opportunity for Duncan Jones to have paid more attention to detail. The plot pulls the movie through. This will be her only saving grace, if the plot differed and the efforts put in by the cast were the same with the exception of Gyllenhaal and Fermiga, ""Source Code"" will fail.<br/><br/>If you – the reader, appreciate movies with a twist and original plots, this is a very good movie. I will not rate it as a must watch, rather I would prefer to say it's a good movie to wrap up a day.<br/><br/>Title: Source Code Directed by: Duncan Jones Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Vera Fermiga & Michelle Monaghan Rated: PG 13 for some violence including disturbing images and for language.

","If I use one line to explain Source Code that would be ""Practically impossible yet nail bitingly bloody entertaining""<br/><br/>Captain Colter Stevens suddenly realizes that he is not where he is supposed to be. He is inside another man's body and travelling in a train to Chicago. What he can remember last was flying a helicopter in Afghanistan. Soon he realizes that he is on a mission that none has taken before and his objective is to get in to roots of a bomb explosion which will take place in 8 mts. Not knowing how he ended up there at the first place and getting little help from the people at the commanding center, Capt Stevens has no option but to complete his mission. And he discovers that he is a part of a top government experiment where he is transferred to a dead man's final 8 minutes of consciousness. He painfully relives the 8 mts over and over again to gather evidence of the bomb blast and to prevent a different catastrophe that is yet to unfold by the same bomber.<br/><br/>The flick is a bucket of confusion from the start. And that's where the entertainment is. You get to know very little of the characters in the movie at the first and expect a lot from them right throughout. You feel like there is a big mystery hidden somewhere but the movie gives you just small hints only. Just like Capt Stevens the viewer would struggle to unfold the dilemma and connect the dots each time a new 8 mts cycle starts. But when the truth is revealed it will blow you away and somewhat breaks your heart in the process.<br/><br/>This movie is well structured. As I mentioned at the start it's doubtful how much the plot is close to real science but the mere interesting execution of what's suppose to be a big 'lie' will make you forget all the glitches.<br/><br/>My reviews at flickshout.tk"

","I like a lot see movies, and this is the kind of movie that ends and you ask yourself: Already finished, where did my hour and a half?, it's that good that you don't realize the time has passed.

For the guys like me, who like to enter in the plot of the movies and try to make sense of it comparing to the real life, I can tell you that this movie is very good on that. To me the use of the science fiction according with the current advances in the science is very acceptable and it can be a reality in some point of our future like many others things that the science fiction has predicted that could be done. We can buy it almost all the stuff that they are telling us, except parts of the final when......... :)), see the movie; though, is nice and I like it because we need to see the world like a beautiful thing and dreams don't cost anything, also we are used to the Hollywood endings.

"twilliams76","7","0","1","13 July 2011"," Duncan Jones does it again!
","Duncan Jones (Moon) gives us yet another short-and-sweet sci-fi treat with Source Code. I didn't like it as much as I loved Moon; but this is still a very respectable watch as some sci-fi is too outlandish and over-the-top for everyday people (non sci-fi fans) to enjoy -- this one has a story that I think should appeal to anybody (it simply is grounded in sci-fi).<br/><br/>As the film plays out (quickly), we discover that Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead) is being sent into a parallel reality to find the source of a bomb on a commuter train headed into the metropolitan area of Chicago. Seated across from him is a pretty passenger who knows him (although he doesn't know her) played by Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, North Country, Somewhere). With only 8 minutes at a time to move about and discover something new about his environment, our hero only has limited options.<br/><br/>As the urgency presses, his supervisor who appears to him via video screen, Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, Orphan, The Departed) reveals to him why he has been chosen for this task and why it needs to be solved. Her supervisor, in turn, Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Casino Royale, The Invasion) wants her to keep mum on all info she offers him and the secret soon comes into focus.<br/><br/>The film plays out at a taut pace and it keeps one's interest rather easily. Gylleenaal and Monaghan are two of my favorite in the upcoming-next-generation of Hollywood so they help make the film play-out even when we are questioning what it is exactly we are seeing. While this one does NOT have a Moon-esque twist at the film's end, it is gripping nonetheless.<br/><br/>I'd recommend Source Code to anybody who likes suspenseful drama ... and leave out its sci-fi element entirely as it isn't what makes that film. THAT is Gyllenhaal and Monaghan."

","I love films or TV programmes that play with the idea of circular time and this movie is an especially good example. Like most of its type, it takes a little while to actually suss what exactly is going on, but once you settle into the rhythm of it, this is a taut, intriguing thriller which keeps you watching until the end.<br/><br/>I got the references to the 80's TV show ""Quantum Leap"" right down to Scott Bakula's off-screen cameo as the voice of Jake Ghyllenhaal's character's father and of course it's not hard to see links to the likes of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Speed"" and even the old Powell & Pressburger classic ""A Matter Of Life And Death"" amongst others that I no doubt missed.<br/><br/>Perhaps a little too much is compressed into the film's 90 minute running time, the way for instance that Ghyllenhaal so quickly finds first the bomb and then the bomber and possibly the freeze-frame moment on the train at the end is a bit too happy-clappy, but these sins are quite easy to forgive, given the main body of evidence here.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal and Monaghan convey an easy chemistry in their recurring 8 minute relationship and Vera Farmiga is also fine as the programmer with a heart who gives in to her humanity in allowing Gylenhaal's character a dignified release after he duly saves the world.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a good thriller, well edited, shot and played delivering a race against time actioner alongside a make-you-think premise on alternative realities."

","A good idea is sometimes more than all the special effects worth millions of dollars. Believe it or not, sometimes an idea happens in Hollywood, too. And what makes this flick above average is just the idea.<br/><br/>Source code reminds me of the Phone Booth with Colin Farrell back from 2002. Simple idea, not too long, good acting and it all makes sense together. In this case, Colter is a dead soldier whose brain is kept alive to participate in a military program. The program, that makes possible to live over and over again somebody else's last minutes of life.<br/><br/>Although there are several questions you might ask and you feel that it does not always seem right, don't bother to think too much and don't look for the answers.

Luckily for me, I only spent five minutes looking at a gay cowboy on a train, because Jake G. managed to pull this one off beautifully.<br/><br/>Is a good story and (what I like most about sci/fi movies) it has just the right amount of ""wow"", ""I didn't expect that!"" and ""I told you I didn't like that guy"" to keep you glued to your seat.

The main problem is the storyline. Yes, I know these types of movies require you to take a leap of faith and leave aside logical explanations, but the ""parallel universe yes, parallel universe not"" that only serves to justify the end did not help me buying into it. And then is the end. All the intrigue and emotion that has carried you during all the movie to end up in something so predictable that makes you sad.

The film throughout the 90 odd minutes carries a deep story-line about a fallen captain! The novelty here is how they mixed the surprise ending with science fiction to the emotional roller coaster. The movie spends its cinematography mainly in few scenes but they adapt it brilliantly, Again this is not the kind of movie you need your minds wide open when watching, cause that is the biggest mistake you can do when you are watching this film.. But the best thing you can do is to open your heart to the characters and try matching with their thoughts and lines, and see how justifiable they are in their own minds.

","SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity. Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. <br/><br/>The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished. Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago. It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky. <br/><br/>*In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth. That is what a superb cast can do with any material, but with this particular strange tale it works perfectly. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

The two issues I have with Source Code are that they repeat the same scene a few times (couldn't be helped, given the plot, but still a bit annoying) and with the really weird reactions of everybody involved. The idea was good, the script was a little worse than the idea, but still good, but the dialogues were really unnatural. Given a better screenwriter, this could have been brilliant.<br/><br/>That being said, I really liked the movie and do not regret choosing to see it. It may be one of the few films that are worth watching in a cinema, as the constraints of the theatre chair are forcing one to get into the feel of it.

""Source Code"" must have been a real challenge to make. It's great, it's surprising, it's exciting, keeps you on the edge of your seat, makes you think!

","This second movie after Jones' very accomplished first movie ""Moon"" is a modest yet satisfying science fiction thriller that keeps the mind ticking and confirms away any skepticism that this director may have been a one-trick pony. Geared towards a more mainstream crowd , this smooth, polished movie,Source Code, works as an entertaining, intelligent, imaginative puzzle. Jones' film is exquisitely constructed and steadfastly focused. As Stevens wakes up time and time again as the same events play out from different perspectives and with numerous consequences. In true Hitchcockian style,a train carriage acts as a restricted and claustrophobic setting where the action plays out. Jake Gyllenhaal is superb and engaging as usual and seemed perfectly cast here."

","Jake Gyllenhaal is a helicopter pilot who finds himself on a train in the body of man who will die along with all the other passengers when a bomb on the train goes off. He has to find the bomb and the bomber and each time he fails he gets sent back in to try again. As he gets to know his fellow passengers he finds himself falling for Michelle Warren.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. The story is a take on the familiar science fiction plot where characters are experiencing a closed time loop, repeating the same time over and over (as seen in several Star Trek episodes and in Groundhog Day) but this film gives it a couple of nice little twists. It is probably a good idea that there is not a lot of detail given of the Source Code process itself. Attempts to explain such impossible things using current science would just not work and you only have to remember The Core to see what that could lead to. I am happy with science being substitute for magic in this type of film. I still wonder why a science technician has to wear in a lab coat in lab with very few chemicals or fluids. I know this just nit-picking but lab coats are utility wear and not a badge of office or a lazy shorthand for scientist.<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside this film is worth watching. There is a bit of tension built up in the hunt for the bomber even if the climax did fall a bit flat. It does raise questions that it didn't really stop to answer about what the Source Code actually did but the twist at the end seemed more of a twist to characters in the film than it was to me because I saw as it as more a narrative inevitability.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"

You wont be when you watch this because this flick moves along a really fast pace from the moment it starts and unlike Inception , you don't finish the film scratching your head wondering what the hell just happened.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is superb , as is Christina Warren , the only one letting the side down is Jeffrey Wright , who plays Dr. Rutledge . His acting is a bit wooden.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Source Code highly enough. It's ninety minutes of pure entertainment."

","This science fiction thriller stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens, A helicopter pilot who wakes up on a train as a man called Sean Fentress. Across from him is Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), a woman he has never met but seems to know him. As he tries to figure out his situation, the train explodes and he awakes strapped inside some sort of iron room.<br/><br/>He is told by a woman on a screen, Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), that he is on a mission to find the bomb that destroyed the train and the ID of the person responsible so as to prevent a much larger attack on Chicago. He has eight minutes to do this.<br/><br/>He goes back again and again via the ""source code"" system that allows him to re-live what happened. It is revealed that Stevens' mind is connected to the dead Sean Fentress's brain accessing the lingering memories of the last eight minutes of his life, creating a sort of parallel universe. <br/><br/>It is an incredibly intriguing concept, complimented with good acting, visuals and editing. However, as with most modern sci-fi films, it futilely tries to explain the impossible with science. Although it is more believable/realistic than others like Hulk or Iron Man. But it still raised questions such as: how can Stevens move around the train and do what he wants if he is only accessing a dead guy's memories? How can he go places that Fentress would not have been in his last eight minutes, such as the bathroom of a station the train passed by?<br/><br/>However, this is obviously not main the point of the film. Even if it doesn't make sense it's a thought provoker and an intriguing idea. Altogether it is worthy entertainment. It's interesting that when Stevens re-lives the explosion as Sean Fentress, the same actor is used (except for his reflection). Which makes sense because it is from his point of view.<br/><br/>The ending was disappointing and stretched the rules of physics even further. There weren't many places to go with the ending though."

","This hurtling high-concept thriller confirms director Duncan Jones (Moon) as the great white hope of cinematic sci-fi. After blacking out in Afghanistan, a U.S. fighter pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes inside the body of another man on a Chicago commuter train, and eight minutes later, when a terrorist bomb rips the train apart, he awakes again to find himself in a sort of control pod, communicating by monitor with a crisp national security officer (Vera Farmiga). What's happened is that the feds have recovered the brain of one of the bombing victims, which retains its last eight minutes of sense memory, and are sending the pilot back into those eight minutes again and again to track down the bomber. None of this makes any sense if you think about it, but the idea is so much fun that thinking about it may be your last impulse. With Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright."

Jake gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are very talented actors and played their roles extremely well. They were very believable and kept me off of my seat.

"danielbardem","7","0","1","17 June 2011"," Source Code is still absolutely worth seeing, especially when you compare it to its competition
","The success strategy of Inception seems fairly easy to pull off. Reality bending sci-fi, action romances cater to just about every audience and has already been copied to similar success. Source Code may fall into this category, but it subverts any notions to prove that it's a cash in to deliver a solid, dialogue driven sci-fi.<br/><br/>Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up in a train en route to downtown Chicago surrounded by people that the woman across from him (Michelle Monaghan) claims that he knows- the last thing he remembers is flying a helicopter in Afghanistan. His confusion is only made worse exactly 8 minutes later when a violent explosion engulfs his carriage- killing everyone on board. As opposed to dying, he wakes up in a dark, metal capsule with only a solitary computer monitor providing him with some context. Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), the woman on the monitor, sends only ambiguous hints but he soon comes to realise that he is the first user of Source Code. Source Code is a computer program that allows you to relive the last 8 minutes of someone's life. After blowing up the train, a terrorist is threatening to detonate a dirty bomb in the centre of Chicago and Colter is sent into the last eight minutes of one of the passengers lives to uncover the terrorist's identity to stop his future attacks. Colter reluctantly accepts his part, learning more about the passengers on train and the army operators on the other side of the monitor with each jump.<br/><br/>Source code is rather unique in that its characters and dialogue are the focus though it's undoubtedly science fiction. The current sci-fi trend seems to be computer effects becoming the stand-in for emotions across the board and it's refreshing to see Source Code reject this. So far this review sounds interchangeable with Inception, but the two do come across very differently. Source Code is a lot more character driven than Inception, with a relatively simple premise being strung along by the cast members' personality and nuances. Along with the main character you begin to gain a familiarity to the people on the train, with each jump creating different circumstances and consequently highlighting different parts of their personalities. You understand the urgency of the military officers' situation but also the moral dilemmas put forth by their actions. This level of detail, not only in the plot but in its characters, makes Source Code a rich experience.<br/><br/>Ironically the least polished part of Source Code is its science fiction. Mechanics of how Source Code works are glanced over and raise more questions than answering them. The details are even more obscured when the ending of the movie completely demolishes the facts that they spent so long explaining. The third act is actually the weakest part of the film. As the game changing plot point is revealed halfway through the second act, the film slows down from there, culminating in an overly sentimental ending which clashes with the tone it set beforehand.<br/><br/>Despite these criticisms, Source Code is still absolutely worth seeing, especially when you compare it to its competition. It's one of the rare blockbuster films with both a brain and a heart and it's still as thrilling as any other pure action film.<br/><br/>Taken from my blog at http://aguywholikesmovies.blogspot.com/"
"prateak09","7","0","1","15 June 2011"," an intelligent and interesting movie...though my expectations were much higher...
","Duncan Jones' sophomore directorial effort after the sublime Moon further proves he has a knack for intelligent, emotion-filled sci-fi's. Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-<br/><br/>1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller.<br/><br/>Here you follow the main character. When the movie starts, you know just as much of what's going on as our main character does: Nothing. The movie starts out with a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) waking on a train not knowing where he is. The girl in front of him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and she thinks she knows him, even when he insists that he is actually an army pilot named Colter. Going into the bathroom he checks his appearance and sees that he has someone else's face. When the train explodes Colter awakens inside a freezing cold container. He's addressed on a computer screen by Colleen (Vera Farmiga), a military captain who explains that he is part of a program called Source Code. It's administered by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and allows a person to inject themselves into someone else's body to relive the last eight minutes of their life. It is said not to affect the past but to address the future. As such, Colter's mission is to go back in time and find out who has placed a bomb on the train so that the bomber can be identified and stopped from setting off a second explosive in the city.<br/><br/>The Story reveals itself in a rapid pace from the beginning to the end. It is a thriller that values its heart and its mind more than velocity or adrenaline. Working in the action genre, it's a more accessible film than Duncan Jones' leisurely paced sci-fi debut Moon. But with a solid screenplay from Ben Ripley the depth and the intelligence have not been forgotten. This is a highly economical film, working in just a few locations and moving vigorously over its lean ninety minutes. Jones is concerned foremost about the misuse of technology but equally the paranoia that terrorism imposes on ordinary people: an intelligent and timely theme, which surprisingly gives way to brief moments of humour. The human responses from the passengers as Colter interrogates them, turning their bags inside out, are quietly funny. Even more fascinating is the way the film touches on how racial assumptions are born from paranoia, like when Colter stalks a man of Indian appearance. These are issues visualised with intensity and originality. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone- setting.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic by everybody. Gyllenhaal is in this movie for nearly every frame and he's great in every scene. He proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an action feature. He succeeds in this role, where other actors may have failed. Gyllenhaal had the perfect persona for this role. He's got a forceful attitude with a sympathetic face. Michelle Monaghan has this innocent charm with her character. Vera Farmiga and the very underrated Jeffrey Wright give very interesting and complex performances as well.<br/><br/>Despite all the positive comments above, I was a bit disappointed. The movie, performances, cinematography, script everything is great. It's just, I had a enormously huge expectation from this, which was a mistake. I wanted to feel the same way when I felt after watching Inception, which did not happen.<br/><br/>I give it 7 for being a deeply enjoyable experience, although it should be noted that considering what was said above, it isn't revolutionary."

The scope is not to rid oneself from all attachments, but to unify the source with the best particular manifestation of those.<br/><br/>Great! As for the soldier twisted plot, i do not see it as the centre idea, maybe if we shift the soldier term to the less material idea that in a way we are all soldiers, but somehow it is unclear in which army:). but I'd rather leave that alone, it seems nonessential and somehow propagandistic compared to the other part, about how we live our lives and how we could actually live them, maybe...<br/><br/>""Everything is gonna be OK"""
"AudioFileZ","9","0","1","13 June 2011"," Stellar Sci-Fi Tale With Great Humanity
","Sci-Fi movies with absolutely as much humanity written in are somewhat rare. ""Source Code"" uses a very ""out-there"" sci-fi framework to tell such a tale.<br/><br/>A heroic helicopter pilot who died in Afghanistan saving lives in the balance is kept ""brain-alive"" so he can be used in an experimental program where he is dropped in to the last conscious 8-minute memory of a passenger in a commuter train targeted by a terrorist. His mission is to reveal the terrorist's name and subsequently allow authorities to stop a subsequent attack that would kill millions with a so-called ""dirty bomb"" in metro Chicago. The whole scenario can be repeated an infinite number of times only limited to the time in between the initial attack and the suspected larger one that is to follow. Whew! Jake Gyllenhaal superbly plays the protagonist who is dropped into the train passenger who is experiencing a budding romance with a regular passenger played by Michelle Monaghan. The fact that his last memory is his latest mission in Afghanistan bewilders him and in eight minutes of consciousness on the train he suffers the fate of his fellow passengers when the terrorist's bomb kills all aboard. His next memory is in some sort of ""pod"" type capsule where he is being reluctantly debriefed regarding if he was able to identify the terrorist. This all occurs in the first fifteen minutes of ""Source Code"", so much for a set-up! As Captain Coulter Stevens attempts to extract what the heck is happening so we, as viewers, are brought up to speed as to what exactly is going on. We learn than ""source code"" is an experimental project dealing with the final retrievable memories a person has before, and actually during death. The premise is that these memories can be used to thwart anything that may be follow subsequently. Well, this is a very good sci-fi premise and I have to say this movie doesn't ""drop the ball"" as it unfolds.<br/><br/>So, where's the humanity? Captain Stevens (Gyllenhaal) has another side that paints a very humanistic palate to hang the story on. He immediately feels a love connection with his beautiful passenger who we learn he has been sharing a common commute for a short time. He also figures out that he has been declared a deceased hero and his unrequited reconciliation with his father. This plays a big role in his decision to keep returning to the eight minutes through multiple ""scenario resets"". In a nutshell; this is where the story adds a great dimension.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" delivers a fast paced fine sci-fi tale made imminently more engrossing by the ""human factors"" of love and light comedy. There really isn't a miss-step along the way even if the ending is, perhaps, a bit of ""feel-good"" open ended one. This movie offers the rare combination of an excellent story, perfect fit characters played well, and fantastic cinematographyHighly recommended."
"chrichtonsworld","6","0","1","12 June 2011"," Predictable and far from complex yet entertaining!
","While the premise sounds new and does have the potential of becoming very intriguing it sadly never gets past predictability. People like me who love science fiction will immediately recognize the similarities to a show called Quantum Leap. The nod to this wonderful series with Scott Bakula (star of Quantum Leap) playing the father was nice. But at the same time it showed how very flawed the plot of Source Code was. The scene was nice and strong only did feel like a rehash of a scene Scott Bakula had in one of the episodes which was so much better. Throughout the movie I felt it was like a rehash of something which was done before and much better. Not that the movie wasn't entertaining. But it sure lacked the depth and intrigue that could have made it a far more compelling watch.Sure the tech talk might be confusing and maybe will give the impression that it is complex.And it could have been if they added some layers into the story. Only it never does. Well,not in a way that it will surprise you.The acting is decent. Source Code could have used more spectacle though.Now it seemed like a production made for television.And there is nothing wrong with that.But I have seen better ones with more cinematic value that never got the recognition Source Code is having. Movie for a rainy Sunday!"

"KyleBel","10","0","2","11 June 2011"," Brilliant Story, Brilliant Concept and Jake Gyllenhaal
","I watched this movie, not expecting some brilliant film. Rather I expected a typical Hollywood assembly line style movie. The concept seemed to similar to the likes of ""Inception"" from the trailers I had seen. Now while at first the hook of this movie seems as though it will be one that drags... watching this 8 minute scene over and over. I believe the most exciting part was when Gyllenhaal's character (Colter Stevens or Sean) surprises his lady friend by predicting the future, (As he has relieved this moment in time over and over). <br/><br/>I couldn't have been any more wrong about my assumptions with this movie. The idea itself behind the source code; being able to recreate the last 8 minutes of someones life as if it were a dwindling remnant of a light turned off, was a quite refreshing concept in itself. The movie's arc is Gyllenhaal's assignment to catch the man who planted the bomb, while we find multiple stories hanging off of this arc. We are given a few true touching moments throughout this flick that are all to relatable to each and everyone of us as well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling to much of this movie i will simply say the stories concept with the ""Source Code"" itself is the most refreshing part of this cinematic masterpiece. The Acting is superb, with no unintended humorous beats and it even may bring a tear to the light hearted. The ending of this movie is one that leaves your mind wondering. I would put this movie well above inception. It's definitely worth watching!"
"fe_scolfaro","8","0","1","11 June 2011"," Extremely well woven...
","Source Code is what ""Inception"" aimed for, with added coherence and no plot holes that I can think of. Well worth the watch, it keeps the ball rolling in what seems to be a genre started by the ""Matrix"" and a few less successful predecessors.<br/><br/>The plot takes place in mental space, so to speak, like with the aforementioned titles, and as with both, there is little linearity in plot time. Somehow it also reminds me of ""Groundhog Day"" and specially ""The Thirteenth Floor"", again with added coherence as there are no questions left unanswered about ""why"" or ""how"" things were happening.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one particularly good point about this movie, I'd say that the script was marvelously written, considering how the time line unravels and how the plot is conducted. The only negative thing about the whole experience is that it comes directly after ""Inception"", and a lot of elements (specially the soundtrack) can be seen and heard there as direct ""consequences"" of it, so I doubt it'll significantly impact the industry at this point in time. But other than that, the script itself makes it well worth the watch (irrespective of how it was executed).<br/><br/>I give it an 8 for being a deeply enjoyable experience, although it should be noted that considering what was said above, it isn't revolutionary. As for the science aspect, if you know a little about quantum physics you'll understand why this movie is specially coherent and creative, and again, well worth the watch (not just for science fiction buffs)."
"intelearts","7","0","1","11 June 2011"," 426th Review: Groundhog Day goes Sci-Fi - good film to get you thinking with good thriller elements
","Source Code is one of those films where 40 minutes in your going meh, but by the end you're impressed. The premise is neat, that recreating an event over and over will lead to different results, but it's the mystery elements that carry this - and the human story that evolves that clearly lifts it from other such films.<br/><br/>We found ourselves really walking out satisfied - and half-way through it seemed to be just the same scene over and over, but as the film develops it does truly surprise you.<br/><br/>All in all, the concept will get you thinking what if, and the plot and the actors will have you engaged and enthralled.

","This was another composite movie of the ""Time Machine"" - Rod Taylor, ""Butterfly Effect"" - Aston Kutcher, ""Out of Time"" - Denzel Washington, etc.<br/><br/>I was okay with the concept that after death of the body the brain waves remain active and the source code takes advantage of that energy. However, I think that the person who should have been on life support should have been the man in the mirror and not the face of Stevens. It would have been a kind of modern Frankenstein as the soul-looking like Stevens was transferred into the body of Fentress. In that way, the audience would realize how successful the Source Code was in that the soul-looking like Stevens lived on the body of Fentress. I got that if the body of Fentress met its death that the full completion of that source would be terminated and both the soul-looking like Stevens and the man in the mirror would cease to exist.<br/><br/>Perhaps I just missed something but somehow not utilizing the image of Fentress was in the end as bad as the mistake of ""The Notebook"" where we are given the image of the dark haired - clean shaven James Garner as Lon rather than the image of Ryan Goslin as Noah - dirty blonde - scruffy beard.<br/><br/>Again, perhaps I just missed something and have no business writing reviews, but then again maybe I think too much about the devil in the details."

","This movie has everything that one loves and expects from a good enjoyable movie.In all the departments, whether it is acting, casting, story, editing, or visuals, this one delivers. I loved the concept of the movie, no matter how improbable it was. All through the movie I kept thinking how it was possible to make up an entire alternate universe from 8 minutes of memory synapses of a school teacher. Most of the time this would be a turn-off and will go against the movie, but it is handled in such a fashion that I was willing to suspend disbelief and incredulity and just enjoy the film. Because every time I questioned the movie, I also asked the question, ""Ok, fine, but I ma willing to see what happens next."" It is a rare thing for a film-maker to be able to do this, especially since this is not a hardcore action movie.<br/><br/>The ending could have been handled better, and was a bit disappointing because the protagonist, who wants to die in 'this' universe, does not instruct the lady Captain to take him off life support in the 'other' universe. but at the same time the message that he does send her is appropriate. Everyone needs to hear 'It is going to be okay.', especially when one is in the same situation as the protagonist.<br/><br/>Some of the people who watched the movie with me were of the opinion that JG's acting was a bit wooden, but to be honest, it fit in well with the mood and pacing of the movie.

","I was of course amazed by this very original concept. But I don't think quantum mechanics allows that in the real word now ... or later. Suspense keeps you in your seat from the very beginning. And even when you finally know who build the bomb, you want to know if the future can be changed. What I noticed first at the end of the movie was the hidden message : enemy is not from outside. The bomb maker is American. But the non avoided train explosion triggers a massive American response in the main time line of the movie. Does it not sounds like a real event occurred ten years ago in our real world ? Is this movie trying to tell the world something like : yes, ""we"" did it ... sorry ?"

","Lots of people seem to think this was a great film, given that it's scored 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. I disagree. It was okay, but not great. Different, but a tad convoluted. Formulaic and a little dry. Here's why:<br/><br/>Plot: Not a bad idea at all. However, the writer tried overload what is a simple story with a little too much heavy-handedness. For instance: Jake G (whatever his character's name is) wakes up from an apparent dream, and doesn't know where he is. Fair enough. So he asks ""Where am I?"" Also fair enough. But then it's case a case of him not being given enough information, as if trying to keep something hidden. Well, something is being kept hidden, but it all goes on a little too long. He could have just been told what the source code idea is etc etc, but instead this atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust is rather artificially forced.<br/><br/>The focus is misdirected. Rather than hiding what ""source code"" is, it's easier to just tell the audience, get them into the basic concept, and save your energy for the more important twists.<br/><br/>The big ""reveals"" in the plot are okay, but they lack narrative strength. The storytelling is a little muddled and formulaic. By creating this artificial atmosphere (undoubtedly to try to keep the audience guessing), it takes something away from the simple storytelling aspect. That makes the twists have less impact, I found. My attention was diverted by the faked tension, and so I couldn't settle into the basic plot premise as much.<br/><br/>Characters: Pretty bland. Michelle Monaghan is very cute, although her role was pretty limited. Jake Gyllenhaal is okay, but he's not given much to work with. The others are average as well, for the most part.<br/><br/>SFX: Nothing much. It's a relatively non-SFX film, for the most part. I did actually see a trailer that had a bus or something explode, but that didn't make it into the film. Maybe the story changed midway or something. Maybe I'm off my head and saw some different movie's trailer.<br/><br/>Overall, it's okay and forgettable. The ending is weak, and lacks any emotional punch. It's too unbelievable. The big screen doesn't do much for it, so look to catch this one on DVD. 6 out of 10."

","Duncan Jones' sophomore directorial effort after the sublime Moon further proves he has a knack for intelligent, emotion-filled sci-fi's. His deft touch with both the action and dramatic scenes shapes Source Code into an edge-of-your-seat thought-provoker which stays with you well after it has finished. Scribe Ben Ripley also deserves credit for his multi-layered script which, although featuring a couple of plot holes for those looking hard enough, pushes the intriguing concept – that you can relive the last eight minutes of someone's life over and over again – past expectations whilst still maintaining a sturdy realism. On screen Jake Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens – the man responsible for repeatedly going back through the last few minutes of another man's life to find clues as to who blew up a train – with a nice mix of individuality and dutifulness, smarts and bewilderment. He shares a natural chemistry with both Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga, a victim of the terrorist attack and a fellow Army officer respectively, who are both outstanding in their own right. The trio invest the story with a believability required and subsequently give the moral questions posed a higher level of poignancy. I've always appreciated a thoughtful thriller and Source Code ranks among the best in this category. 4 out of 5"

It's easy to like Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan but the supporting cast is equally good. Vera Farmiga is intense.

So I had absolutely no idea what to expect.<br/><br/>The movie starts of really good instantly grabbing your attention and I must say, the movie does a really good job in keeping your attention through most of the movie. The filming and setting is great. The scenes are not grand but fits the story perfectly. Special effects and settings are top notch. So no comments there. The acting is good to very good. The main characters play their role perfectly and by doing so they make the story more intense. No comments there.<br/><br/>However, I read some other reviews and apparently there are a lot of dumb people reviewing this movie. The main problem with this movie is that the background story/idea on which this entire story/movie is based, is completely insane, impossible and as far-fetched as I have ever seen. The movie is set in the present and presents it self as a physiological thriller (so no sci fi). But as I said, i can not give any details as that would result in spoilers. But just to give you a hint of how unbelievably stupid this movie is; normally when your body stops but your brains are still functioning, your alive, when your brain stops your officially dead. Not in this movie, in this movie, even though the brains are still functioning, your dead. How stupid do they take their viewers?<br/><br/>all in all, good movie and a fun ride, however if you have any high education or at least your own opinion based on common sense, there will be a moment in the movie where you will be thinking, that is completely impossible. If the writers wanted to make this story believable they should have presented the movie in a different way and used a similar set up as in the movie inception. The source code is eventually a bad rip-off from inception, (background)story wise.<br/><br/>Go rent the movie and I promise you will enjoy it, however be aware of some serious short comings in the (background)story.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: As there are a lot of people saying that this movie is intelligent I feel that I am obliged to explain the opposite. When our main character starts to thinks what the 'f' is going on, our big scientist arrives and asks, ""do you know something about quantum physics?"" ""because by the means of quantum physics we have made it possible to relive the last 8 minutes of someones memory"". Now I am not a quantum physics scientist, but the link between reliving someones memory and quantum physics is VERY far-fetched. As the end of the movie makes clear that he is actually not reliving someones memory but is in an alternate reality, the link with quantum physics does show up. So apparently they were setting up for explaining the alternate reality. Or did our scientist already knew? However there is still a big flaw there as well. There are an infinite number of alternate realities and actually ending up in such an identical alternate reality several of times is IMPOSSIBLE. Ow and if our main character is reliving someones memories, how then can he leave that train or even explore if there are no memories of doing something like that? So at that moment I was already thinking, here is something wrong. In the end, being an alternate reality, this is explained. At the end, as I stated above, another big flaw, our main character is apparently not dead, he has wires attached to his freaking head and you see him actually moving!!! So why kill him off???? Ow yeah, and in the alternate reality, what happens to the guy that in who's body the main character ends up? Well, i guess he is dead, great job soldier, killing a person in another reality and taking over his live. No excuse in the argument, he would have died anyways. Any person daring to call this movie intelligent should be ashamed."
"eschetic-2","8","0","1","17 May 2011"," Sci-fi Lite, but a satisfying, intelligent date flick
","In a film so fast paced that most audiences wouldn't notice any plot holes until well after the lights come up, the Asimovian/Heinleinian underpinnings are so well written that even after a couple hours discussion most will feel that a majority of the obvious incongruities are satisfyingly tied up - and given the general appealing nature of the characters and story, you will want to talk about the film over long drinks or desert afterward if this is taken as the intelligent date movie it should be.<br/><br/>One of the nicest things about SOURCE CODE is that *part* of the quality in the writing is knowingly letting the audience guess what's going on a scene or two ahead of the characters. We went in not even knowing the core concept, just that there were sci-fi overtones and that the lead was the always enjoyable Jake Gyllenhaal - it could just as well have been Matt Damon or any of the other current young action heroes - and were immediately swept up in the well explained action. All very satisfying, but, as I said at the start, also ultimately light. Because it is at its heart a sci-fi mystery, once the mystery is solved it doesn't seem as weighty philosophically or as demanding of re-viewing as, say, a GROUNDHOG'S DAY, but it is just as much undeniable fun at the time.<br/><br/>Despite my last sentence, this is a film I'm going to want on DVD when it comes out. The CGI effects - both exploding trains and the in-lab environment(s) for Gyllenhaal - are beautifully executed and the real time cinematography is a delight to watch. Is Chicago re-imagined as it might look in a decade or two or shown as it is? From these crispy clean overhead and suburban angles it is hard to tell for this non-native. If the setting is, as I suspect, in the near future, it is delightful to have an essentially optimistic take on the future for a change.<br/><br/>Just HOW optimistic will depend in part on how the audience interprets the final scene - which is one more admirable aspect of the generally salubrious writing. Note that the final text message sent and received (is it to this reality or an alternate? Your choice) is ""Help him"", not a request to ""give him what he wants"" *now*. Again, what is meant or how it will be interpreted is left to the audience - and offers as many possible interpretations as there may be dimensions the audience is willing to posit.<br/><br/>This will almost certainly be long forgotten by the nominators when the year-end honors are being proposed, but it is still the most satisfying non-epic science fiction film I have seen in a very long time. If you like light sci-fi or tech-mysteries, this is close to a don't miss and a great potential date movie if your date is intelligent enough. Think INCEPTION-lite. I suspect that in 50 years SOURCE CODE will play as well as the 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto films do today - even though no one is going to build a series around it."
"CinemaFrostedBetty","7","0","1","17 May 2011"," High concept at its best
","First off, I'd just like to say I had absolutely no desire to see Duncan Jones's Source Code (2011) upon hearing of it, but since the majority of my friends are male, I've come to accept that despite the fact that I'm a film student, I don't always get to pick the flick, and I will constantly suffer through exposure to explosions, muscles, bad accents, and aggressive one- liners. However, Source Code offered none of those things (well, except for the whole explosive device on the train part of the plot) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that. In this (romantic) action-thriller, Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself thrown into a serious mission where he must find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train—here's the shocker. while inside the body of another man! Essentially, Colter's mind is utilized as an experiment with a new program, ""Source Code,"" which somehow magically allows him to be in the mind of another man's body for the last eight minutes of his life— this man being a passenger/victim of the commuter bombing. This is a smart movie, or it at least comes off that way. I was so busy trying to keep up that I didn't even have time to think about whether or not certain aspects were actually plausible. I had accidentally left my diagram that lays out the development of a structured narrative involving time travel, the cerebral cortex, and existentialism in the car. My bad. But like many say, ""It's just science!"" Jake Gyllenhaal succeeds in this role, where other actors may have failed. He brought character to the character. Anybody can read a script out loud and call it acting, but Gyllenhaal had the perfect persona for this role. He's got a forceful attitude with a sympathetic face. Yes, this could be another macho thriller, but instead of a bulky, apathetic protagonist, we get an emotional, relatable, well-developed character. Source Code will provide you with an exciting 93 minutes of mind-bending. Sure, what you're getting is a high concept film, but it's high concept at its best."
"blackmamba99971","10","0","1","3 May 2011"," A really good parallel
","I thought this was a great movie. The idea of using soldiers who are near death to do their duties in a place called the source code. A place where a human's last moment in history lives in the brain even after death. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a captain where on a mission is killed in action. A secret part of the government uses his body and brain to peer into the minds of victims on a train to find a bomber. But he has only eight minutes to do it each time because the victims memories only last that long after death. So, he goes in as someone else on the train in the source code to find a bomb, and the bomber to stop an even greater threat. Yet his thoughts dwell on his past which interferes with the objective. Seeing this as a new approach to his plight, he alters a few things to give himself a new path to stopping the crazed maniacal domestic evil doer. With him in the real world is Goodwinn (Vera Farmiga) who helps him in small ways as to be not noticed by her superiors. Now with his objective in sight, he stops the bomber and saves the people on the train within the source code. This now gives a new path for which alternative realities can merge within themselves, yet cause no damage. This movie held a great story, to see paths of lives changed because of a dead persons thoughts. The music was a little soft, but held better for dramatic purposes. Effects were fine, that really was not the story anyway. And the idea that now, it could be possible to use a person's subconscious after death. How to map it is something else. I recommend this film for those fans of the psychological thrillers, I do not recommend it for the idea of still using mid east tactics to sell films. We are past this, move on and away from the mid east, people do not need it in their lives anymore."

","It's not everyday a movie comes out that can keep a viewer on the edge of their seat at one moment, and then sighing with romanticism at the next. Jake Gyllenhaal's role as ""Special Agent Man"" is one of variety. He is an actor who is able to play an action scene and then suddenly change gears into a love connection in seconds. His lines are flawless, his expression will make the viewer feel like they are on that train with him.<br/><br/>Michelle Monaghan is the perfect female protagonist. Her cute facial features and sweet dialog was enough to keep me glued to her face anytime she was on screen. She delivers her lines with expert timing, and plays the role of ""Confused Lover"" better then any other actress could. A absolutely lovely pick for this role; Props to Duncan Jones for this.<br/><br/>How could one forget Goodwin (Farmiga); the essential ""mother figure"" to Gyllenhaal. Her mixed emotions to Stevens (Gyllenhaal) make for excitement and anticipation to see how her decisions will influence the plot. With good looks, and a kind heart, she is the perfect actress the role. <br/><br/>Ahh of course. The famous ""Half-Antagonist"". Rutledge (Wright) plays the scientist who uses Stevens for his ""experiments."" At first the viewer could see him as being either good or bad, but as the movie goes on we see him in his true light as a man who will use others for his ill gains. Wright plays the role very well; I found myself infuriated with him after he broke his promise to Gyllenhaal about his ""freedom"" after his mission. That's enough to make me applaud him for his work.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Source Code"" is a huge hit to me. It is the first movie of 2011 that made me enjoy paying the ticket price. If your looking for to go on a action-packed adventure into the world of secrets and lies, ""Source Code"" is well-worth it's price.<br/><br/>9/10 - AG"

","21st Century's movies have become more sophisticated to watch and even more to understand.Every filmmaker has his own way of telling a story.But,when it comes to sci-fi,using some of the basic science concepts an weaving it to a movie's storyline is just amazing. Having said that,Source Code relies upon Quantum Mechanics in its storyline.Now Quantum Mechanics,as most people know,is one of the most complicated branches of Science ever.So naturally,the movie goer expects a twisted screenplay. But the biggest factor acting in the movie's favor is its lucid style of storytelling,that keeps the audience hooked to the screens from the first minute of the movie till the end. The movie reminds you of Deja Vu and Vantage Point at places.Especially,the Vantage Point's way of story telling,by replaying the some of the same scenes again and again,and at the same time,revealing some important twists along the way. Although an intense action/sci-fi/mystery thriller,the movie will be loved by men and women,movie buffs and non-movie buffs alike. Although the movie boasts of many plus-points,I was quite disappointed with the visual effects in this movie.Blame me,but my eyes have only begun to accept High Definition and filter everything out! On the acting front,I think this is a landmark movie for Jake Gyllenhaal,and he will be popularly known the world over as the ""Source Code"" star. Although,I expected more of Vera Farmiga on screen. OK,let me stop here now,on thing though,don't read the synopsis until you watch the movie on big-screen! Trust me,this is one of those movies,where you should blindly go by what the Movie Critic says....!"

","The film has a really interesting storyline, Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) military helicopter pilot awakes up on a train and has no idea where he is, why he is there and doesn't recognise anyone around him, opposite him sits Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him and keeps referring to him as Sean, this creates the first of the films 'huh' moments. He spends a few minutes stumbling around the train dazed and confused gets to the toilet and looks at himself in the mirror and sees someone else, shocked he bolts from the toilet runs into Christina and then they are both engulfed in a fiery explosion as the whole train is destroyed.<br/><br/>Colter awakes strapped into some sort of harness in what appears to be a metal room of sorts with someone who refers to themselves as Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who proceeds to run a series of memory tests on Colter, evading Colter's questions about where is he and what is going on. He doesn't get any answers and is constantly being told by Goodwin that time is running out, and asked 'have you found the bomb yet?', 'have you identified the bomber yet?'. Further confused Colter gets told he has to go back into the Source Code; once again he awakes on the train in what appears to be a repeat of the earlier events, except that he notices he can change things. This series of events repeat several times as he eventually locates the bomb, several red herrings are presented including a foreign individual (who is completely innocent) identifying the US military's ethnic profiling procedure.<br/><br/>All the while, as these events are reoccurring it becomes more and more apparent that Colter is not doing this because he is following orders, but because he has started to care about the people on the train and is continually trying to save them. But every 8 minutes or if he gets killed in the Source Code he winds back in the chamber. Eventually after pushing for more answers a new person speaks to him, a Dr Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who is bullish and insists he carries out his orders. But gives a very quick indication as to what is happening, that he is reliving the last 8 minutes of Sean's life, but that it is futile to try and save the lives of people on the train because in reality they are already dead, what he is essentially doing is reliving a fixed moment in time, and that he must hurry as the events that are occurring in the Source Code happened that morning and that the person responsible for the bomb is planning another, bigger bomb and that is why he needs to hurry.<br/><br/>All the time this is going on, the chamber that Colter is in keeps changing, getting smaller, colder, bigger raising the question, where is he? As the film comes to its climax Colter finds out that in the real world he is actually dead, killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Naturally this comes as a bit of a shock to him and comes to the realisation that his only purpose is to stop this bomber, he comes to an agreement with Dr Rutledge that if he stops the bomber he will be put back in to the Source Code. With new impetus and the hope that he can go back into the Source Code and live happily ever if he stops the bomber he identifies the person responsible for the bomb, but in doing so gets shot by the bomber. Once out of the Source Code, the information is relayed to Goodwin and Dr Rutledge and then to the relevant authorities and they apprehend the suspect who is a normal person who has a personal vendetta against the modern world.<br/><br/>It quickly becomes apparent that Dr Rutledge has no intention of allowing Colter back into the Source Code, leaving Colter in his chamber he goes away to get the plaudits for his Source Code experiment. Colter starts to talk to Goodwin and reasons with her to let him back into the Source Code and to pull the plug on him after the 8 minutes.<br/><br/>On this his apparent last voyage in to the Source Code he not only stops the train bomb, but captures the bomber, handcuffs him to a rail on the train, phones the police and tells him where the van with the dirty bomb is parked. He also borrows someone's BlackBerry and sends an email to Goodwin. He tells Christina that he loves her and as the 8 minutes come to a conclusion kisses her and as Goodwin pulls the plug the world freezes mid kiss.<br/><br/>Seconds pass and then the world continues, Colter looks at his watch and the timer moves past 8 minutes, and the universe doesn't end. The scene changes to a military lab and Goodwin walks in and checks her email, she receives an email from Colter stating that if she receives this email the Source Code isn't just 8 minutes but a whole new universe.<br/><br/>How you interpret this is up to you, is it a new Universe, is this an afterlife, what Colter's subconscious wants to happen, and that is the beauty of the ending, it isn't set in stone it is open to your interpretation.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and I will definitely now watch Moon, Duncan Jones's first film. Having already bought the film on Blu-ray about a year ago that is half the battle done! I loved the ending, I really liked how open ended it was, the acting was great throughout, Dr Rutledge trampling on Colter's rights just because he is technically dead rises some interesting questions no matter how effective the Source Code technology is.<br/><br/>For more reviews check out my blog: warningmaycontainspoilers.blogspot.com"

","""Source Code"" is a movie about trains blowing up, but with far more intelligence put into it than explosive action. The former is why I didn't see it at first, the latter is why I finally had to. Another movie that belongs to the science fiction romance genre. Heavy on the science fiction, light on the romance.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a U.S. Army colonel who only knows where he should have been: in Afghanistan on a helicopter mission. He doesn't know where he is now: in some cell after a bomb on a train was detonated. The movie tells us everything we need to know about this new world he's in and the mission he's on. The description of this science fiction world was thought out way more than most Holllywood movies attempt. I appreciated that.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Source Code"" was Jake Gyllenhaal and his character. He completely stayed in character, and the film managed to always keep the character in check. I felt for him, and I, too, wanted him to save the world and get the girl. The worst part, was the three or four endings that dragged on way too long. Hollywood couldn't just let a good movie be, they had to add multiple twists which undid the story they were trying to tell.<br/><br/>""Source Code"" exists in a world where terrorists plant bombs, the hero tries to win the girl, and after awhile, things just stop making sense. Oddly enough it sounds like the real world, but it doesn't have to be. If only they knew to leave well enough alone."
"Jigsaw_At_The_Disco","7","0","1","30 April 2011"," An Interesting and Unique Thriller
","You have eight minutes to prevent the world from ending, but you have no idea where you are or why this huge responsibility is in your hands. What in the world do you do? Captain Colter Stevens is faced with this harrowing question and many more, and you'll find yourself looking for the answers with him in Source Code.<br/><br/>I think you'd be surprised to here that Source Code is a movie for everybody. If you're looking for action, Source Code is your movie, it seems like there's an explosion just about every eight minutes. (you liked that didn't you?)If you're looking for a movie that'll make you think, Source Code is without a doubt your movie. But you don't HAVE to think during Source Code, I think it's safe to say you can have a below average IQ and still enjoy it unlike other sci-fi thrillers like Inception.<br/><br/>When asked what Source Code's weakness is though, I'd have to say it really struggles with depth. Not only is there really no emotion in any of the characters, other then Gylenhall's, the film has a hard time helping us understand the characters at all. We touch bases with why the villain is doing what he/she is doing, but as interesting as it all sounds, we never truly understand him/her. To me, it's almost like Source Code decided to skip over this as if it was unimportant. And that same thing goes for all of the characters, not just the villain. A lot of the time you'll be asking yourself, why is this character doing this? Why don't they do this instead? So I guess what I'm saying is that in the end, the writing for Source Code is mediocre. It has it's high points but most of the time, it wasn't very good. It's an interesting premise and I can see were the writers were trying to get at with the main character and the villain and the plot in general, but it feels like it never really got there. <br/><br/>The good news is, there were a lot of things that bailed the writing out. Duncan Jones, the director of Moon, is great and I think he did a good job dealing with the bigger budget. He showed me that he can direct those big action sequences just as well as anybody out there. The cast also did a great job with what they were given. Jake Gylenhall has clearly come a long way since Donnie Darko. His haunting performance in Brothers stands out as one of his best ever. I think he did a great job portraying Colter Stevens in Source Code, but that he could have come away with an even better performance if he was faced with a character with a little more depth. The music was not what I expected and at first I didn't know how it was going to work with the film but it ended up making a lot of situations more intense and more emotional then they would have been without it. <br/><br/>In the end, there's no reason to be tough on Source Code. It's a very enjoyable, fast paced film and anyone can enjoy it. I was surprised that I had such a good time while watching it and I didn't regret picking it over Fast Five this weekend. Oh, and I was genuinely surprised that the movie went along without Gylenhall having to take his shirt off. . . sorry ladies!<br/><br/>***/*****"

The information about what was going on was slowly revealed, adding a bit every loop, and created the same atmosphere as Memento.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie, get's a little bit boring, because everything is already revealed and gets more predictable with each minute. The ending is quite thought provoking and more or less original, so at the very least, it will at least make you wonder about the concept of reality for a brief moment.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a movie that would appeal to most viewers (especially Memento fans) and I definitely recommend watching it."

","Being a fan of high-concept films, I was always going to see this film and I am 100% glad I did.<br/><br/>At it's heart Source Code is an easy concept to understand; A train will explode in eight minutes. The protagonist must find the bomb. If he fails he can try again, as he is in a machine called the 'source code' simulating time travel. Simple enough? Things get complicated as the plot takes unusual and exciting twists and turns. Just what is Source Code anyway? Is it really time travel? Where is the protagonist in reality? And. of course, the challenge of finding the bomb and the bomber in eight minutes every time. It's great fun that will keep you on the edge of your seat for every minute.<br/><br/>What I really loved was the fact that the audience knows no more than the protagonist. In the opening scene he is flying, then he is in a train. How did this happen? Neither the protagonist or the audience know the answer. It really is a fun journey of investigation and action.<br/><br/>The acting was completely believable, this real-life setting giving the film great strength in terms of helping the story continue. There are some great unexpected moments on the train, where just as you think you have found the answer, the film knocks you on your head. Great stuff.<br/><br/>The film also has some great cinematic moments, featuring a scene where everyone on the train freezes for a few seconds, greatly impacting on the emotion of the scene itself as well as satisfying the audience with what is clearly a fantastic film.<br/><br/>I'm sure anyone can enjoy Source Code, providing they get sucked into the story (not hard to do). If you get a chance, do not hesitate to watch this. It will surprise and entertain you."

","A man comes to on a morning train. An unfamiliar train, and he's wearing somebody else's body. Confused, he tries to get his bearings but 8 minutes later a bomb blast takes out train and everyone on it. After a strange interlude, our man is back on that same train, back where he started with a mission to save the future. Yep, this is one of those time loopy science fiction thriller joints, but for a film with such hoary gimmick its actually rather decent stuff. It has problems, but first off here are the things that really work. Jake Gyllenhaal pulls off a great turn as the confused hero, his movement from perplexity to fragmented understanding and frustration, gradually into ultimate determination is the driving force of the film above and beyond the plot and e convinces every step of the way. Michelle Monaghan is a fine love interest/foil, sweet natured and pretty with the right flashes of shock and confusion at things going down beyond her comprehension. Jeffrey Wright is similarly fine as a secretive, gently amoral scientist, whilst Vera Farmiga is fairly convincing in a slightly underwritten sympathetic military role. The other big plus to the film is its tightness and measure of real excitement. Flashy effects work is largely eschewed in favor of clock ticking suspense and physical rough and tumble, also writing is tight and the viewer is placed in the same position as the hero, without flashbacks or extraneous character detailing we find out everything alongside him as the film progresses, maintaining a fair sense of mystery and making for the odd decent twist. The tightness of the thriller structure and its execution actually lead into the films problems though. At the centre is a piece of science fiction gimmickry explained with analogies and some one six fits all quantum physics jargon. It works just about well enough to hold things together, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny and in the end hurts the film, as the final (seemingly tacked on) sequence is rather jarring. The suspect explanation also meshes with the structure to bring down the films potential as thoughtful science fiction, it is mildly thought provoking but doesn't really go anywhere with its mind expanding possibilities, nor the moral and existential questions that arise during the course of the film. I guess one is not really supposed to question a film in this way, being that it is after all a thriller and not some piece of ""hard"" science fiction, but when the potential is clearly there its hard not to be a little ticked off when it isn't realised. Still, by and large I had a fine time with this one on a basic entertainment level, I'll give it a generous 7/10."

","This movie was AMAZING, so many twists. This have to be one of my favorite movies of all time! I didn't know what to except when I started watching it but oh my god, I'm in love with this movie. If you haven't seen it go get it RIGHT now. You'll love it. I can't stress enough how wonderful this movie is. It has a perfect blend of story and excitement. The actors are great and the plot is just down right genius. I'd defiantly recommend this movie to everyone I talk to.

","To me, it seems like most modern films are over-hyped and usually don't live up to their hype. to me, this film felt like the exact opposite. I didn't see too many previews of this movie on TV or the internet, But i just got back from watching, and i think it deserved more hype.<br/><br/>Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gylenhaal) is a U.S. Army Chopper pilot who wakes up in the body of a man on a train destined for disaster. He doesn't know how he got there, or what is about to happen, and He's sitting across from his girlfriend Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) 8 minutes after realizing he isn't who he is, The train explodes. This brings him back to reality, as a man strapped into a machine, being assisted by Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) They want him to find out who blew up that train, through a highly advanced piece of technology, known as ""Source Code."" <br/><br/>Going into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I haven't seen to many action flicks, mainly because action flicks end up being the same old garbage. But this film surprised me. It was kind of slow out of the gate, but as Capt. Stevens learned more, along with the audience, I got more and more interested. But there were a few little things that I noticed.<br/><br/>One, The special effects were badly outdated. The train's crash did not look very realistic, and the transformation from Past to present, Present to Past seemed very Generic. In one scene, Capt. Stevens falls and rolls, but the Special Effects looked like Star Wars: Episode II, and that movie is almost a whole Decade old.<br/><br/>Also, at some points it felt like Jake Gylenhaal Overacted. The one particular scene where he gets extremely frustrated with Goodwin to the point where he uses a 4-letter word which I cannot repeat, Sure felt like he tried too hard...but that was the only part. the rest of the film he was superb.<br/><br/>One thing I couldn't stop thinking about was how Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) looked sort of like Carrie Fisher (who most of us know as Princess Leia from the Star Wars movies) And that's pretty cool. Another thing that was cool, was seeing Russell Peters in the film. Most people know him as the Indo-Canadian Stand up Comedian who often makes fun of his own people, mimicking their accents and their culture, Even near the end of the film he makes a few jokes.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, There is a message in the film about life and how it could end so quickly, so maybe if you have a suicidal friend or feel like you have nothing to live for, maybe this film could be an inspiration to you.<br/><br/>I Recommend this movie, if you have a night to waste, go and watch it, you shouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>9/10"

","That time of year - beginning in the month of April - where truly great movies start to emerge is finally upon us, so it's no surprise that I should get exactly what I wanted out of the Sci-Fi/Suspense Source Code.<br/><br/>The film stars Jake Gylenhaal as Colter Stevens, a US Army helicopter pilot recruited for a top secret operation known as the Source Code, which enables a person to relive the last eight minutes of a life deceased during a major catastrophe, and used to prevent further foul happenings from taking place. He is repeatedly sent into the scenario of a pre train explosion in the guise of another man to try and piece together the mystery of the bomber, all the while falling in love with a woman (Played by Michelle Monaghan) sitting in the row directly across from him.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Duncan Jones, the man behind 2009's intriguing Moon, and he's obviously not a one trick pony. One of the things I love so much about the film is that it reminds me of the sort of film Alfred Hitchcock would have directed, right down to chilly atmosphere and editing, kinetic cinematography (Supplied here by the great Don Burgess), and a ubiquitous musical score which evokes all the tension that Hitchcock's longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann would extract. Jones is a visually impressive director, and he only does good things for this movie.<br/><br/>But the screenplay by Ben Ripley is just as much to thank for how good the movie is. He balances the arks of the characters, the action sequences, and the ever present desire to solve mystery in erect, orderly structure, and offers appropriate opportunities for the cast, specifically that of Gylenhaal, as well as Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, and Jeffrey Wright, to truly shine and showcase their talent. Just be sure you're keeping your uninterrupted attention on what's happening.<br/><br/>The movie is a huge collaborative effort, and as a result, a tense, intelligent film that must not be missed.

","Born and raised in Chicago,the train scenes were a source of constant distraction. That is to say, I was predisposed to confirm or deny the accuracy of anything pertaining to the train scenes. For example, The trains appeared to be Metra units; however, they carried a different logo. The train interiors did not have Metra upholstery. They is no Glenbrook station. Glenbrook is an area between Glenview IL and Northbrook, IL. The area includes Glenbrook High School and Glenbrook Hospital. There is a Glenview station. The Glenbrook station in the film appears to be the Arlington Heights station. In which direction were the trains traveling? The Metra trains run out of Chicago like spokes on a bicycle wheel. They travel north, south, east and west. Otherwise, I throughly enjoyed this film at the historic ( 1927 ) Pickwick Theatre in Park Ridge, IL. The story line was riveting, and was well told. The entire cast gave very believable performances. All the scenes moved the story along. There were no wasted moments of film or dialogue."

","This is an amazing movie. It pulls together a lot of the cooler concepts in physics (some of which are not directly articulated). Ideas such as quantum theory, Schrodinger's cat, and the many-worlds interpretation are combined with locked-in syndrome and the idea that human consciousness and memory itself exists as a quantum construct and can be manipulated as such.<br/><br/>The above is the smoke and mirrors that make up the story-telling part of movie magic. And few movies are as deft doing this as _Source Code_. Fewer still are movies that achieve the depth of verisimilitude this one does in using possible implications of real scientific ideas. <br/><br/>Once the movie postulates its ideas, it does a wonderful thing. It treats them logically. The movie resides within the rigid framework of that logic. As a long time s-f reader and movie fan, seeing the screenwriters, director, actors and all involved actually having the discipline to do this is very special.<br/><br/>The movie then adds a thriller plot, compelling characters, actors that make us care about those characters, romance and a resolution that is emotionally gratifying. <br/><br/>That is why I rate _Source Code_ 10 out of 10. If there is a better movie to come out his year, I would be shocked and gratified. I would be happily surprised if there was even one other movie this year that approached being as good as ""Source Code_."

","Wow! Duncan Jones is AMAZING! In Source Code, he manages to keep a energetic and complex plot rolling, while bringing to light the very real question, of, ""If you only had a short amount of time left to live, would you spend it trying to save yourself, or would you try to impact someone else's life in a positive way?"" The story is centered around Capt. Coulter Stevens {Jake Gyllenhaal}, a helicopter pilot who wakes up on a train in Chicago in the body of another man, sitting opposite of a woman named Christina {Michelle Monaghan}who acts as if she and him know each other. Then the train explodes and Stevens wakes up inside a machine called the Source Code. He then finds out that he is part of a program designed by a man named Dr. Rutledge {Jeffrey Wright}, to enter the last eight minutes of another man's conscience, thus allowing Stevens eight minutes to try and find the bomb and the bomber that are on board the Chicago train. Find the bomb, find the bomber, prevent another major catastrophe in the heart of downtown Chicago. With a great script, an awesome cast, and an amazing director, Source Code is a thriller you must see! ""What would you do, if you only had eight minutes to live?"""

","In conventional usage, ""source code"" is the programming language that is human readable, which is converted to ""assembly language"" or ""object code,"" which runs the computer. Commercial software firms never release the source code, and sell the binary object code, often at a handsome profit, think Microsoft Windows, for example. There are also Free and Open Source programs, such as Linux, Fire Fox, Open Office, and others whose source code is universally and freely available to anyone.<br/><br/>I went to this movie, thinking I would recognize some reference in the storyline to ""Source Code,"" as described above.

"seansshack","9","0","1","12 April 2011"," Source Code: A classic tale mixed with modern filmmaking
","Background and insight: Pure Science Fiction is often regarded as too complex for film audiences, which is why so often we see it mixed with other genres. Fine examples are the likes of Star Wars and The Matrix (etc), where you get action/westerns mixed with Science Fiction. I have always been a fan of science fiction films. They present a higher (usually) level of imagination than most genres. The rules are not always confined to real world, realistic events or physics. The only real limitation is the imagination of the writer. Science Fiction relies on its audience to suspend belief, which can be a step too far for some viewers, but for me this is one of the reasons I have always loved film, the chance to escape and experience things that only the silver screen can allow you to experience (in the visual sense). I really enjoy writing science fiction, but like the examples above I also tend to mix the genres and stay clear of pure science fiction. Duncan Jones on the other hand has been looked upon as being a modern day saviour of science fiction with his first film Moon. A master class of indie film making that was so well made, it was (and still is) almost impossible to figure out how it was made for a tiny budget of $5 million. But I'm not here to review Moon and don't believe in comparing bodies of work. But if you haven't seen Moon, check it out. It is a great example for indie screenwriters and directors on how to make a solid film that stands out with very limited budget, locations and cast, In much the same way as Buried succeeded (but without the gimmicks to keep the audience interested). As a writer it's the type of script you will (at some stage) get asked for. A short or feature with one character in one location and your first reaction will (nearly) always be, yeah right. Then you think of Moon and recall how well that redefined the rule book on this type of restricted film making and you find yourself feeling just a little inferior (from a story telling standpoint).<br/><br/>My full (extensive) review wouldn't fit here so if you would like to read it all (and the rest): http://tinyurl.com/6ay5wp3"

","First of all I should admit Source code is one of the best so far out of what 2011 have already seen. Its real neat and Crisp thriller so that you don't wanna invest your bite of snack thinking what happened in the past scene missing the forthcoming's. Its brilliantly neat. Oh yeah, Jake is the best throughout the movie carrying a very sensible part and delivering his best out of what all he have done so far, a big thumbs up. You gotta mark this in your book buddy, kudos. Not to be forgotten the touch of Duncan Jones, the script speaks for its self and its brilliantly narrated with a huge risk of audience easily drifting towards the other side of thought about the movie, luckily the effort yielded and no soul felt bad with the performance of the crew and captain, at least with what i had witnessed in the theater.Its hard to Imagine some one delivering this concept in a much clearer fashion than what Jake and Duncan Jones combination delivered with Source Code and the Pair worked out excellent with the best thriller. I should really give a 10/10 for what it is and rather not to pin point things for which always there are more movies to address, after all what we are happy with are the things about to be praised for. Good job guys.."

"kluseba","7","0","1","11 April 2011"," Where Avatar meets Inception meets the Green Zone
","I was really intrigued by the trailer of this movie and decided to go to the cinema for the first time for a pretty while. The film is very worthwhile and touching with a great main actor, an interesting plot, a lot of suspense and action, a twisted part towards the last third of the movie and a happy ending with a philosophical focus.<br/><br/>The only problem is that we have recently had movies such as ""Inception"" or Avatar where people are getting transfered to different place and sometimes in the body of different persons in order to save the world or where they fall in love with a stranger. The conspiracy story surrounding this movie makes me rather think of ""The Green Zone"". ""Source Code"" is surely an entertaining and intriguing movie but it somewhat lacks of originality. A good twist, some emotional and dramatic touches and a very good acting still make this movie stand out and pardon for a rather mediocre script that also has a plot hole concerning the explosion of the two trains that works well timed even though the villain isn't able to observe the right place and time to commit his attack while the first train is also too late and should indeed have meet the other train a couple of minutes earlier than we see. Another thing that I must criticize is the weak villain that is not charismatic enough and I didn't like the rather superficial reasons and motivations for his devastating acts.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Source Code"" is a very entertaining and worthwhile movie but slightly overrated and not as stunning, innovating or gripping as one might think. It's worth to be watched at the cinemas because of the visual and sound effects but a part of that, I would rather suggest to wait and loan this flick later."

No. This is something, maybe not completely new, but still thrilling and good and not used so many times before.<br/><br/>So, the storyline - Colter Stevens an American Army helicopter pilot, wakes up on a train, discovering that he has assumed the identity of another man and he has 8 minutes to discover the bomb and change the world that he knows... 8 minutes, blast and wake up somewhere with a voice telling that he needs to come back and solve the mystery not only abut the bomber, but about himself too. Who is he? Where is he? And can he change the events that already happened? Those are the questions and it is really worth to watch this movie to have them answered.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

He's even more puzzled when he looks in a bathroom mirror and sees a different face. It seems that he's part of a military experiment to investigate the fact that this train is about to blow up as part of a massive terrorist conspiracy, after which he will wake up in a pod-like interior, where he can communicate with other military officials. He can be sent back a bunch of other times to pick up more clues, but the catch is that he can only be sent back for eight minutes at a time due to constraints.

","Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train, with no idea how he got there. A total stranger (Michelle Monaghan) treats him like an acquaintance. His reflection in the window shows him another person's face. The train explodes. Colter finds himself strapped upside-down inside a strange machine.<br/><br/>'Source Code' is only Duncan Jones' second feature and already he has been compared to Christopher Nolan. It's not hard to see why - Jones seems partial to playing with your mind, and he does it well. Minutes in, viewers are as confused as Colter is and just as desperate to find out what is going on. It's not long before things are explained, but that just messes with the mind even more.<br/><br/>As it turns out, what Colter experienced was a Source Code, a virtual re-play of a real-life event, where subjects experience the last eight minutes of someone else's life. He must experience the same event again and again to find out who bombed the train, before the bomber strikes again in real time.<br/><br/>There is a bit of exposition about how Source Code works, but it is pure tech-nonsense, delivered so hurriedly it's over before you can say ""plot device"". Like with the dream machine in 'Inception', it is not how the tech works that matters but the kind of story that it allows. 'Source Code' is primarily a thriller, mixed with sci-fi, drama and whodunnit mystery in the right proportions. The genres never clash, and it is down to Jones' talent that it all feels masterfully coordinated.<br/><br/>It's not very hard to spot the ideas that inspired 'Source Code'. The film's influences are so obvious that they might as well be in the credits. Virtual realities - 'The Matrix'. Time on loop - 'Groundhog Day'. Time-travel crime-prevention - '12 Monkeys', 'Déjà Vu' and 'Minority Report'. Despite including all these elements, 'Source Code' doesn't feel unoriginal.<br/><br/>Tired of stories where time-travellers are not allowed to do anything for fear of changing the future? No problem, it's only a program, so actions have no consequences. Bored of omnipotent action-men? That's alright, Colter has no idea what he's doing. As Jones and writer Ben Ripley break down the barriers of conventional genres, old ideas are recycled in new ways. The result is a story so fresh that you don't mind if it's not entirely original. 'Source Code' is more clever than cliché, and greater than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal steals the show in his most impressive performance to date. Colter is, at different times, an amnesiac, a frustrated soldier, a helpless civilian, a determined action hero, and an amateur detective. Most importantly, he is a normal man, not above flaws or feelings. Gyllenhaal shows remarkable range, playing all of this with subtlety and making Colter very believable.<br/><br/>However, Jeffrey Wright's approach to his role (as the brains behind Source Code) undermines the tone of the film every time he appears. Limping through his scenes and mumbling with a distracting speech affectation, his melodramatic mad doctor schtick would have been more appropriate for a Hammer Horror production. Still, this is a minor flaw and doesn't come anywhere close to derailing the film.<br/><br/>'Source Code' is an engaging and highly enjoyable film, with a great concept and even greater execution. Along with last year's 'Inception', it seems that Hollywood is beginning see the value of intelligent blockbusters. At this point, it is still too early to tell if Duncan Jones is indeed the next Christopher Nolan, but he certainly shows promise. Keep an eye out - he's going to be big."

","Source Code is a great science fiction movie. Forget all the mindless action of modern sci-fi, this one makes you think. And when I said it makes you think, I mean in a good way, not like how Inception just messes with your head and you think it's really deep. Then you walk out of the theater and realized you got cheated.<br/><br/>Well written science fiction is one that expands the consciousness. Source Code shares much of the plot of the show Quantum Leap, which I've never seen. So maybe for fans of the old show, the movie may not be that innovative. <br/><br/>But after watching Source Code, I was relieved that the writer/producers did not go certain overly predictable routes in the ending. It is still relatively constrained within the rules of its own creation. That's the difference between sci-fi and fantasy, magic and technology. Magic is generally unconstrained by its own internal logic. Too often now, ahem Inception, sci-fi movies are just unrestrained action flicks that leave you more confused than enlightened."
"d_art","9","0","1","10 April 2011"," 'Source Code' is a unique, entertaining thrill ride
","This film is a sci-fi geek's dream-- a cross between Quantum Leap, Groundhog Day, and possibly a computer adventure game. The film starts off like an episode of Quantum Leap. The main character is Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up inside a commuter train, with an attractive girl in front of him, who already apparently likes him (perfect!). He looks in the mirror and finds out that he is someone else, at least to everyone else around him. He realizes too late that the train he is on has been set to explode in 8 minutes, which happens. He wakes up inside a pod of some sort, a part of a government experiment in which he can travel to the past, into the consciousness of a passenger's last 8 minutes of his life (multiple times). His mission was to find out who had caused that explosion, so the culprit can be located (in the present) before he bombs another train or building. To add, Colter can go to the past, but he can't change it to affect the present. The film goes on to explain all this with jibber jabber about parallel universes and its link to the last 8 minutes of a memory of a deceased passenger. Colter can enter into this new reality and interact with things that the passenger hadn't experienced—because it's actually a parallel universe, you see? (Say what?). Thankfully, the film doesn't try to explain this in great detail.<br/><br/>Now, once you can run with this idea, it's an extremely entertaining movie. Like Groundhog Day, death isn't a factor for Gyllenhaal's character because he will merely return back to the pod after 8 minutes. I'm partly reminded of the text adventure games I used to play when I was a kid--you'd die and you'd return to a saved point, where you can try a different route in the story. In essence, you don't even have to really focus on the mission. In each scenario, Colter would try different things to find the bomber, but on the side he proceeds to find out more about himself, of which he has only fuzzy memories of. Given 8 minutes each time, the pacing of this film is relentless. Understandably, it's not a heavily character-driven film, aside from Jake Gyllenhaal's character. The whole train motif, the confused protagonist, and pastel colors bring back a bit of Hitchcock. The pacing is consistent and the twists keep coming.<br/><br/>The suspense in the film works mainly because we care about Jake Gyllenhaal's character. Gyllenhaal is a great everyman. He reacts just as one would expect in such extreme circumstances. He struggles with his own desires, duty, and with his rights which are being infringed upon. Michelle Monaghan does well enough as Colter's potential love interest, Christina—understandably, due to time constraints of the situations, she is not complex. How many meaningful conversations ever stayed within 8 minutes, after all? Likewise, the government agents who are heading the experiment, as played by Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga, feel mostly like archetypes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun, entertaining thriller with many potential threads. Like Inception, as Hollywood films go, this is a unique film. The ideas aren't new, but it takes a fresh approach. The 8-minute gimmick forces the story to waste little time. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal brings in the emotion and Duncan Jones' taut direction pulls out the suspense. Because there are so many ways one can go with this material, this could have been a pretty good ongoing TV series like Lost. If not, I imagine straight-to-video sequels coming soon.<br/><br/>For more of my movie reviews, you can find them through twitter.com/d_art"

Unlike ""Inception,"" as well as numerous other movies which incorporate this plot twist, this leaves no room for speculation as to how the truth may or may not be apparent, as it wasn't designed for speculation, just an ""ah-ha!"" moment.<br/><br/>At first, you'll want to watch it again, after coming to conclusions as to whether it happened this way, to cause that, or that cause was an effect of this causal reality, and try to ascertain a somewhat clear opinion (and it will be opinion, like as to what an artist may or may not be saying with their art);however, the point of this mobius strip movie, in my ""opinion,"" is not for it to have audiences arrive to a conclusion as to what was real, what was fantasy, what was effect, what was cause, nor do I believe it had anything to do with time travel, quantum physics, but the whole movie was itself just a gimmick to have the audience concentrate on figuring it out.<br/><br/>I won't go into details about the beginning clues, end clues, as they are irrelevant in my determination that this film had only one mystery, and it wasn't to see what was cause, and effect, or what was real, what was fantasy, nor delve into metaphysics, fringe science, but to be simple, it was in my opinion, a perfect example of a cinematographic interpretation of the 3 dimensional mobius strip.<br/><br/>If you are not aware of a mobius strip as learned in math class, research it. The plot, and writing were beautifully executed to bring a harmony and balance in tit for tat clues which in the end were so balanced, they each canceled one another out, until there were essentially no clues, and looking at the formula, and discarding the variables which may give the watcher a clue, you will find, your mind has just played a trick on you, believing there was some point to this, some end, some beginning, but the only real point was the pleasure in trying to figure this out, and the only beginning was the time you sat down to watch this nicely executed film, twist your mind back and forth, and finally, mangle it in the end with a flurry of what ifs, and why this, and how about that...<br/><br/>Most films of this nature, give you a clue as to what ""really"" may have happened, and the better ones leave the watcher with a sense of it being open to interpretation, and gives subtle hints as to it's true intention based on the characters, the direction, the end, and the beginning;however, if you try to make sense of this movie intentionally riddled with plot holes which embraces it's twisting nature which is not apparent until the end, you'll find it makes no sense, other than a nice trip that had no beginning, and no end.<br/><br/>What I found quite clever about this film is that no one seemed to get it, that this film is not to ""get,"" but to be enjoyed in ""being got"" Yes, if you think you know what really may have happened, even if arriving to the conclusion, that one cause is the original effect, or even if there are two or more possible conclusions one can arrive to in an effort to make sense of this mobius strip movie, then you have been ""got,"" and the writers and producers must be really enjoying the reviews, and watchers interpretations as this is all in your heads, in our heads...a film that delivers an intentional purpose supposedly, but when mathematically weighed, and logic applied to the max, the only explanation is this is a gorgeously balanced equation that says only one thing...""I am here."" An enigmatic, ""what came first, the chicken or the egg?"" formulaic artistic cinematic experience that will leave you guessing, until you realize, your guesses are in vane, and unlike most films of this genre, is not open to interpretation based on clues, or lack of.<br/><br/>A twisting loop that has no end and no beginning...possible only in math with our linear thinking minds, but when you put it on the big screen, the dear mobius strip comes to life in vivid color and detail; however, it being a representation of a mobius strip, one can finally conclude, this movie had no end, no beginning, and the twist was intentionally put there to confuse you as to whether it did or not.<br/><br/>The acting is good, cast is decent, and a movie I'd recommend to friends, just to hear their interpretation of what ""really"" happened. (nothing really happened, as there is nothing causal without an effective reality, which this movie operates on, so it essentially, never happened...the movie was nonsensical, but appeared to make perfect sense, but what movie can make sense, that according to math, never happened?) Writers are starting to incorporate math into their movies, as the tired trite twists of yesterday become mundane and over shadowed by the glittery graphics of the new age of cinema, and expect more math in the movies, especially as our society becomes more intrigued by thought, than by mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>A good movie, worth the cash, but your ""final and real"" decision on what REALLY happened, like I said, will be in vane, as an argument on determining the beginning and ending of a circle would be.<br/><br/>Well, there's my two pennies.<br/><br/>I've wasted my last two, so.... a penny for your thoughts?"

","Finally a movie worth writing a comment about. It was original and not some three minute remake of an existing movie or a cookie cutter piece of crap. I like the suspense and a cast of unfamiliar faces that doesn't have you thinking of the last movie you saw that super famous type cast actor in. Keeping the how and what of everything that happened before the opening scene makes for a good way stay interested in this film. This movie had that 12 monkey's feel to it but very different.

","I walked in the theater expecting another Vantage Point...with just boring repetitions of the same crime scene, but the movie is fulfilling in so many other themes as well as having much more involvement that it was a pleasant surprise to go see it.<br/><br/>Okay...I will admit, that the first 3 scenes or so are really...average. EXACTLY what you expect, even the explosion is done in a quick/rushed nondramatic and unconvincing manner. <br/><br/>But one thing I enjoyed was that just about each time when Gyllenhaal's character gets sent back into the train via the Source Code, how<br/><br/>1)There's a different objective <br/><br/>2) There a subtle changes to pay attention to <br/><br/>3) Achieving that objective often plays out awkwardly and comically. <br/><br/>Going back into the train felt like an I-Spy game or even like Goosebumps books where you choose different endings. This part of the movie feels really free and loose, and Gyllenhaal really takes advantage that he knows he can do just about ANYTHING in this reality, though knows he has a goal to pursue--which may be more challenging than it seems.<br/><br/>More predicaments, twists, character involvement and additional plots occur, too many of them do, so they're not all predictable. Also, this movie was truly emotional towards the end. It delves into what it means to live life to the fullest and to experience happiness.<br/><br/>What I must admit also though...is that the ending took off the ""perfect 10"" star for me. A forceful moment in the storyline near the end was so perfect that you'll wish that was the ending, but instead, the story continues for an extra 5-10 minutes, in a fashion that provokes questions and confusion, and the real ending is definitely not as satisfying.<br/><br/>BUT...the movie was still largely a great, and surprisingly entertaining ride, and a nice runtime too.

","Long story short, Source Code isn't time travel. It merely relocates Stevens' consciousness into the lingering memory trail of the recently deceased. Cool, right? The problem is that such a heady concept immediately opens itself to a thousand potential plot holes. For instance, if Stevens is reliving the terminal eight minutes of someone's life, why can he exit the train at random when the body and mind he's sharing has no frame of reference for it? How does he even know what the passengers two cars over look like? Even if you buy into the flawed logic of ""Source Code,"" the filmmaking just isn't up to snuff. Jones throws subtlety to the wind for this antithetical take on the genre he seemed so passionate for two years ago. He imbues the proceedings with a nondescript glossy veneer and achieves unanimously stilted performances from his cast. Character actor Jeffrey Wright comes away looking especially bad, but Gyllenhaal is also mismanaged in the lead.<br/><br/>It isn't their fault; Jones lacks vision and Ripley lacks talent. The latter in particular seems incapable of executing on even his better ideas interestingly. By his hand, Stevens' lame bomb-sniffing stratagem boils down to blindly badgering suspicious-looking commuters and eventually lucky guesswork. Maybe some will respond to his common sense approach, but I much prefer watching characters more clever than myself weasel their way out of trouble. For all his military training, Captain Stevens might as well have been Joe Average Passenger."

","I saw a short review for this film on Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman, but I wasn't sure what to make of it, but hearing a bit I guess I got more interested, so I decided to go and see it, from director Duncan Jones (Moon), David Bowie's son. Basically American army helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a commuter train sitting next to Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan), she is calling him a different name, and he sees in the mirror he has assumed another man's identity. Eight minutes pass, and the last things he sees is a train passing, and suddenly the train explodes, and he wakes up in a dark pod, and he talks to someone called Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who wants to know if he knows who caused the train to blow up. She explains that a bomber has threatened to set off another bomb somewhere, and until Colter discovers this knowledge, he will be sent back to the same time, all events repeating again, until he finds the bomb and the man controlling it. So the events in the eight minute time repeat many times, he finds the bomb in the carriage toilet above in a vent which has a mobile phone timer, and the bomber is extremist passenger Derek Frost (Michael Arden). When Colter returns to real time in the pod he tries to piece together what he remembers last in his past real life, and work out who is controlling this new technology, including with Goodwin and scientist Dr. Walter Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). Rutledge tells him that he cannot change the future, as he is working with what is called the Source Code, a technology that is made by placing his mind into that of a person who has eight minutes of memory before they are medically dead, obviously the memory is that of the man with Colleen. Throughout the repeated events Colter slowly finds himself falling for this woman who believes he is the other man, but against the orders of the technology minds he is sure he can change events. So in what he requests to be his final sending back, Colter catches the bomber, disconnects the bomb, and what would have been the final minute does not discontinue, and in this new time zone he carries on living. In the end you discover that Colter was essentially on life support in the Source Code pod, and the final moment sees that the text message he sent in the memory time does go to Goodwin, saying that it works better than they thought. Also starring Russell Peters as Max Denoff and Cas Anvar as Hazmi. Gyllenhaal gives a good modest performance, Monaghan is good in her time on screen too, if you took elements from Déjà Vu, Murder on the Orient Express and Groundhog Day then that sums up the film as a whole, the story is patchy in places, and the ending could have been a little improved, but overall, not a bad science-fiction drama at all. Very good!"

","Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on board a train heading to Chicago, in a body he does not recognise and with no knowledge of what is going on. The train explodes and he finds himself in an unknown place, being told by a woman calling herself Goodwin that he is going back and doing the whole thing again, in order to find the bomber, and that he has an eight minute window in which to do so. So begins a dual-challenge for Stevens: to complete the mission, and to understand why he is there in the first place and what is going on.<br/><br/>Duncan Jones is treading a slightly different path to his father, but is proving to have inherited the gene for creativity; I adored his debut ""Moon"", and although perhaps not quite as good a movie (it would have taken another masterpiece to have stood up to such an impressive first film), his follow-up feature is still very enjoyable and exciting. ""Source Code"" is not written by Jones, only directed, and is far more a balls-out thriller, but interestingly it still explores some similar themes and questions as ""Moon"". The slightly higher budget has been put to good use, although Jones is a director who proves that big explosions and incredible CGI effects are nothing without a brain, and that good filmmaking is more fundamental than those things; even in today's hi-tech, fast-moving world, a film still needs to do more than look pretty.<br/><br/>Just like its predecessor, ""Source Code"" sets you up with ideas you have seen explored elsewhere; where you could find the roots of ""Moon"" in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solaris"", ""Source Code"" has closer kin in the likes of ""Speed"" and ""Inception"". In the case of both of his movies, though, what marks them out as great is what he then does with those ideas and how much heart the films have. Granted, ""Source Code"" is not quite as surprising as ""Moon"", but it still proves to be an intelligent, challenging piece. Another thing I like about his films is the science of them; they do not skip over explanations, and he works hard to lay what some might consider complex ground work for his audience, ala Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Despite some small quibbles with the movie, such as the fact Clint Mansell would have scored it better (I mention this because I know it was only timing and circumstance that prevented Jones working with him again), and the film actually having room for a bit more development in the central location (it is rare for me to say I feel a movie would have benefit from being longer), I still very much enjoyed myself and recommend it as a cinema trip! Jake Gyllenhaal continues to prove himself to be a terrific lead actor who can carry a film, and do not assume that the ""Groundhog Day"" idea of the same eight minutes replaying time and time again gets boring; just as you get to a point where you feel it might get stale, the film changes things up; those who have seen ""Moon"" will know just how surprising Jones is. The drip-feeding of information keeps you hooked, and just as interested as Captain Stevens in finding out what is happening.<br/><br/>If Duncan Jones just keeps doing what he is doing, staying ambitious and not becoming lazy, I see good things ahead for him, and I see myself being a big fan!"

","Source Code follows a soldier, Colter Stevens, (Jake Gyllenhaal) who awakens to find himself on a train heading for Chicago. After talking to the stranger opposite him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him well, he goes to the bathroom and standing in front of a mirror sees another person staring back at him. As we think about what on earth is going on, the train suddenly blows up and he wakes up, again disorientated, to another scenario. Leaving all those questions unanswered, it kind of drags you in! Now within a dark room we find he is linked to a program, the source code, that uses shadows of peoples memories to relive the last 8 minutes of their lives. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), a sympathetic operator of the source code sets him the task of finding the train bomber so that other attacks that have been planned later in the day can be stopped before they occur.<br/><br/>When I watched this movie, I thought that it was going to be solely the whodunit mystery revolving around the train and the identity of the bomber. However this is not quite the case as Colter finds himself unsure of his surroundings while not in the source code. This leads to the viewer having two riddles to solve- on the one hand who is the bomber and on the other the mystery behind who has put him into the source code and why is he there. I feel this puzzle within a puzzle adds to the excitement giving the movie several levels to work on.<br/><br/>The one thing that this movie had to contend with is the potential for there to be large scenes of repetition whilst Colter is on the train reliving the same moments again and again. This is well handled with enough variety that you become more intrigued by what he is going to do next and start demanding that he pick on a particular character that you have had your eye on for a while rather than the one he is currently investigating.<br/><br/>The movie is well acted with Gyllenhaal in particular putting in another strong performance to follow up his one in Love and Other Drugs with the relationship factor once again playing a strong part in his role in the movie. In general though the acting is impressive and I look forward to Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie wouldn't ya know!) next foray into the movie world because after this and Moon he has a lot of pressure to deliver something exceptional.<br/><br/>The only slight issue I have with this movie is something I can't really talk about until you have watched it. So all I will say is this- I was not a great fan of the way things ended.<br/><br/>Source Code looked like it was heading for a good haul before it was released and it does not fail to disappoint. I was never falling off my chair in anticipation but it is a cleverly thought out plot that is executed well with good CGI, acting, music and enough mystery to pull you through to the end. Not a classic but a very good watch none the less.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","There are so many lame-ass films out there, being made directly for cable. Or ""big"" films being made in 3-D even though their plots and their merits are ""small."" They think that the special effects and the extra dimension might obscure the fact that no one would want to watch the film otherwise.<br/><br/>I am not going to say anything at all about the plot of this film. I knew the set-up (I'd seen the trailers). And that's all you need to know if you haven't seen the film yet.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, and then coming home and thinking about it all, there are obviously some major logical problems in the science behind this sci-fi. Could that actually happen? Probably not. But if that's going to kill your enjoyment of the film: tell me, where did Mary Poppins go when she floated up into the clouds? A UFO? Heaven? Neptune? The answer is totally irrelevant. If you are inclined to ask such questions, don't see the film.<br/><br/>This film was so shockingly good, and literate. And human. This is probably the most human sci-fi film I've seen in years. It didn't rely on computers or visual tricks for its effect.<br/><br/>What you take home with you after seeing the film will be a product of what you had in your heart before the film began. And after you see the film, is this more about love, or hope? (And the film clearly illustrates faith, hope and love, but it is not at all religious and you won't notice unless you are.) There are obvious parallels with earlier films, especially that absolutely terrific masterpiece Groundhog Day. But while I was watching the film, I was not focused on identifying the past similar themes.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this film that would seem to pose a problem for home screening. No sex or rough language. No gore or graphic violence. I can't imagine a child under 12 years old being interested, but there's nothing here to warp their development. And I think this would also be a good ""date movie,"" because a lot of it is a love story.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain. Justly so, IMHO. But I thought that his performance here certainly equaled his earlier celebrated performance. Not a false note in this film, in which he is on screen for at least 90% of the time.<br/><br/>I can't fault any of the acting. Amazingly good for a sci-fi film.<br/><br/>I gave it a 9/10, because I've not yet totally concluded that something so unheralded and mainstream could be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is a film as much about the heart as about the mind. Or scientific facts. I've often contemplated how the advent of cell phones has changed screenplay-writing, allowing the easier ability to call for help. This film integrates current known cell-phone technology seamlessly. And there is a cell-phone call here that is absolutely heartbreaking.<br/><br/>I can't say more than ""see it."""

","Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a passenger train. He is confused and disorientated as the woman across from him engages him in conversation. How did he get here? Why can't he remember anything? Why isn't he with his battalion in Afghanistan? These questions abound in his head when an explosion is heard and the train car explodes killing all on board.<br/><br/>After the explosion, Captain Stevens wakes up in some sort of simulation chamber. He is strapped to a chair and a small video screen appears where Mission Controller Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) calmly requests that he recalls the incidents on the train leading up to the explosion. Stevens learns that he is part of a military scientific experiment wherein they can insert a consciousness into another body in the past for a span of 8 minutes. Stevens has assumed the body of a non-descript school teacher and he is continually sent back in time (much to his frustration) with the mission of determining who triggered the bomb so that future lives can be saved.<br/><br/>We then sit back and get a mix of Minority Report meets Memento meets Groundhog Day as Captain Stevens continually travels back and encounters repeated behaviors from the passengers in an attempt to extract clues that will lead present day authorities to the bomber's capture.<br/><br/>Upon his return visits, Captain Stevens is distracted by two involving yet distracting sub-plots. The first involves a budding relationship with Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) – a fellow passenger on the train. There is little chemistry to be compounded in 8-minute intervals, but Christina's involvement in the investigation will be paramount leading to the eventual climax.<br/><br/>The second diversion comes with the Captain's attempts to determine his own fate. Why is he here? Did he volunteer? Why doesn't he have any recollection of the events leading up to his cooperation in the operation? Is he dead? These questions will impede his focus on the tasks at hand and cause for much confusion and stress between the Captain and the commanders running the operation (code named Beleaguered Castle).<br/><br/>Sharply scripted by Ben Ripley (Species III) and efficiently directed by Duncan Jones (Moon), Source Code is better than it should be thanks to the combined efforts of the believable cast and the tension of a reducing timeframe in order to identify the terrorist.<br/><br/>Dead ends do occur, but they are plausible actions taken in a live game of Clue where one query or investigation may lead to the exclusion of a potential threat. Gyllenhaal steps into a role that would likely have been cast to Harrison Ford circa 1991 and he does his best to help us forget that it's the Prince of Persia himself trying to help solve a case that will save millions of lives.<br/><br/>The final chapters of Source Code are Inception-ish in that the ending can be argued for interpretation. Whether the laws of science and science fiction could be altered in a Twilight Zone finale might leave some groaning in non-acceptance. Add to that a few plot holes (one involving a gun) that just didn't make sense based on the parameters set by the premise, and the movie just fails to meet the mark of 'excellence' and has to settle for 'very good'.<br/><br/>But that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying an enjoyable film that can make rehashed scenes still feel new and exciting. There is some good action intertwined with an intelligent script that doesn't talk down to its audience as he barrels its way down the tracks.<br/><br/>www.killerreviews.com"

","Over the years, Science-fiction thrillers have either proved to be really good (District 9) or completely rubbish (Skyline)...There really haven't proved to be so many excellent films, but District 9, Inception, and Matrix are my faves. Director Duncan Jones has truly dazzled me with Moon, but that's really it. Jake Gyllenhaal also hasn't proved that he's a well-known actor 'over-the-world'. This film, however, proves me wrong.<br/><br/>'Source Code' is a fresh and highly original thriller that exceeds from a visual view, as well as a visceral one. A smart piece of writing and just the right amount of humanism is put in.<br/><br/>Performances don't tick so much in these kind of thrillers but Gyllenhaal gives his best. He literally carries the film with his light hands and guides it in the right way. His worthy acting is to watch out for. Even though the other performances weren't paid much attention too, they were at least decent. Monaghan is O.K.; playing her character with simpleness. Vera Farmiga is the same, but slightly better. Rest of cast is natural and fits in.<br/><br/>Thrills in this film are highly praise. I was hooked onto the film as soon as it started. Slightly surprising? Well-done transition from the train to the 'pitch-black' hole is shown. Visual Effects have to be one of the year's best...<br/><br/>Overall, what can I say...Source Code is definitely worth watching over and over again. Its mind-bending, thought-provoking, and very well-crafted. It also has to be one of the best films I've seen this year, as well in the Sci-fi category. Wow, forget about everything and go see this film!"

The movie is written with concepts which entail the string theory, and alternative events. In the movie, the soldier has no idea of what is happening, but he must complete the same mission over and over again. What is great about Source code is the sub-plot which asks the question what effects does the experiment have with the present? I will not ruin the movie by writing anymore. I give source code a 9 or 10 out of 10. Source code was not my first movie pick yesterday! I am very happy we went to see Source code over battle Los Angles."
"Hellmant","8","0","2","1 April 2011"," 'TWELVE MONKEYS' crossed with 'QUANTUM LEAP', eight minutes at a time!
","'SOURCE CODE': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Director Duncan Jones follows up his critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit 'MOON' with this critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit, although the film is more fantasy than science fiction since the science of it is not grounded in reality at all. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. It was written by Ben Ripley (who's only other film writing experience is in direct to video and TV 'B' movie horror films, like two 'SPECIES' films) and was filmed on a budget of just $35 million. The film tells the story of a soldier who travels into the body of a man killed by a terrorist explosion for the last eight minutes of his life, repeatedly, in hopes of finding information that will prevent the terrorist's next attack. It's sort of like a variation on 'TWELVE MONKEYS' or 'QUANTUM LEAP' (Scott Bakula even has a cameo in the film). While the movie is completely over the top and unbelievable it's still a very well made and entertaining film.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens, a former airman stationed in Afghanistan who, as the movie opens, unexpectedly finds himself in the body of another man sitting on a train. After eight minutes the train blows up and Stevens then comes to in a capsule communicating with another military officer named Carol Goodwin (Farmiga). He discovers he's part of a military program called 'Source Code' and must continue to reenter the man's body for the last eight minutes of his life until he can gather enough information to discover the identity of the terrorist responsible for the explosion and lead authorities to his capture before he strikes again. While doing so he falls in love with another passenger on the train (Monaghan) and becomes obsessed with saving her life even though he's told it's impossible.<br/><br/>The story is far-fetched but the characters are involving and believable. While the concept of the film is kind of routine and unoriginal the script is well written in it's details. The performances bring a lot of heart and emotion to the film, especially Gyllenhaal (like always) and Farmiga, and the directing is top notch. In many ways Duncan's two films are very similar in their core. They both deal with a man who unwittingly finds himself the tortured victim of a science experiment meant to serve a greater good. While this film is not quite as clever or interesting as 'MOON' it does match it's strengths in character development and emotional drama. Duncan is definitely a promising up and coming director and I can't wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0"
"PhilS","7","0","2","2 April 2011"," Thrillers as well written, acted and shot as this are rare.
","Saw it on its opening day, yesterday and have to say it is one of the relatively few recent films that I want to own on Blu-Ray to watch over and over.<br/><br/>This is all spoiler free, so you'll be kept in the dark as you watch - best way; so please don't read too many reviews lest some surprises are revealed. The film looks great and has some lovely aerial shots; the acting is top notch from all concerned. It's quite refreshing when, in what is afterall an action movie, the producers and director have been able to cast people who can say so much about their individual characters by the slightest of looks or ways of moving or keeping still. I'm not a massive fan of Jake G's movies, but in this he really shows his acting abilities. There is one scene where he really gets everyone sniffling just by raising his eyebrows.<br/><br/>There are some logical flaws, but as with anything fantastical, you've just got to accept the briefly described premise and run with it. So, sit back for the beginning and enjoy - because you'll soon be sitting upright as the story and events draw you in. You find out stuff at the same pace the main characters do, and that's quite enjoyable. You'll be lulled into thinking you know what comes next, or what is actually ir/relevant. But then sit forward with the rest of the audience as events unfold. It's a short film at approximately 93 minutes; I'd have liked more time with some of the train passengers, but as mentioned earlier, these actors do wonders with the little screen time they have. I always think it's a mark of good writing when I end up considering and caring about what a character is doing when off stage/screen and what their motivations are.<br/><br/>A famous director once said that Groundhog Day was a masterclass in how to show repeated actions and events, yet keep them fresh. That happens here too. The style of story and storytelling of many favourite movies went through my mind as I watched, yet I never felt Source Code ripped them off: Groundhog Day, obviously, but also Bourne Supremacy, Mission Impossible, Quantum Leap and (elements of) The Jackall.<br/><br/>Music is used cleverly and they give you visual hints and throwaway shots that later make sense. There is a feeling that you think you can see the end coming, but trust me, you could be wrong...<br/><br/>They get the repetitive quotient right and for that reason I liked it more than the effects laden and overly dream layered Inception.<br/><br/>A great thriller with twists right to the very end. Duncan Jones is a great director to watch out for."

","Review of Source Code The Good<br/><br/>Think of combining Three Days of The Condor and Moon, and then gamify the hybrid, you get Source Code – almost. A highly enjoyable movie experience with the suspense, the pace, the unknown identity (not quite as exciting and intense as the first Borne Identity movies though), and the pressure to piece together a puzzle that will save a city and redeeming a personal love discovery. Duncan Jones proves he can delivery even more than Moon. And Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was solid.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>The premise of the story is flawed. It doesn't take much away, but left you wonder after leaving the screening on that premise – did Colter live on in the alternative universe accidentally created by Source Code through the 8 minutes of memory flashback of Sean the teacher?<br/><br/>Goodwin's humanity, and Dr. Rutledge's drive for success is quite cartonized, so was the bomber, and even Colter's personal redemption with his father. Think of the Unthinkable, a thriller that gave every character some layers that as extreme as their actions might be, there is a psychological accessibility for the audience."
"MovieProductions","7","0","2","3 April 2011"," The epitome of a popcorn flick
","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Source Code"", Jones' sophomore directorial debut is, simply put, the epitome of a popcorn flick. It's visually astonishing, the action is well choreographed, and there are twists and turns at every corner. Sprinkle in a few solid performers and a well written script, and you've got yourself a good movie. Yes, ""Source Code"" may be that monthly action-heavy film that wins audiences over based on its titillation, but it actually has a bit more substance than your average thriller. The film actually has a nice message, and questions our perspective on life. <br/><br/>First off, I thought Gyllenhaal, Monaghan, and Farmiga all delivered great performances. They did what they were supposed to do, and rose above what they had to work with. Moreover, the scenery was pure eye candy. The fact that this sucker has a budget less than one hundred million dollars is impressive. Not only that, but the action is top-notch. This movie is just replete with thrills. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the script was very well developed. The twists were neat ideas, and their executions sufficed. Any problems? For one, there were a few unbelievable moments. I won't spoil them here but I'll give you a hint: it's towards the middle portion. I kept thinking, ""how did he get away with that?"". I guess because the director just wanted to get the scene over with. <br/><br/>Not to mention, the end is very abrupt. It just ends. It's almost like after the climax, BOOM! It's over. There's no resolution. It wasn't a bad ending, it just wasn't a good enough one.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Source Code"" should have no problem financially, critically, and universally. It's a film that clicks with almost everyone, and respectfully so. It has all the elements of a solid film, while staying true to its genre. If you're craving for a solid sci-fi action flick, look no further."
"alplo","9","0","3","3 April 2011"," Say: ""Life if beautiful!"" with the ""Source code""
","""Source code"" is shocking film. The shocking in all senses of this word. So high-quality movie that grasps the spirit. This film - individuality, bright stain gray weight cinema's plankton. It's especial, unique, with a highlight. <br/><br/>Exist many movies in which follow the idea: ""life is beautiful, and we have to accept it as it is"". But in the ""Source code"" this thing is showed somehow in especial way, ambiguously, if I can say so. This is very important because when you watch this idea is expressed simply and it's banal, the idea don't take rood to you. After watching just this movie I understand that life such amazing with its failures and successes. Life is life and any program like source code won't come back it. You can make its illusion but not real. This is because we have to appreciate it. This is sense.<br/><br/>The movie haven't made to trifles but it doesn't matter. Jake Gyllenhaal is unbelievable. All the film turns around him. His performance forces to feel unusual emotions and things. Duncan Jones is amazing and all people who made film."
"FbxCycler","9","0","1","2 April 2011"," Source Code: Inception Meets The Matrix Meets Quantum Leap = The First Big Thriller of 2011
","I saw Source Code this afternoon, in a lightly-populated theater for the first matinée showing of the day.<br/><br/>Source Code is one of those movies that you really can't explain or talk to anyone else about unless you've seen it.<br/><br/>It's a very good film, along the same general lines of Inception and The Matrix trilogy, with a sprinkling of (and more than the tip of the proverbial hat) to Quantum Leap and a dash of The Adjustment Bureau along with a smidgen of Deja Vu for flavor. And, it's got more than a little bit of Groundhog Day mixed in.<br/><br/>Throw all that together, mix in some excellent acting by Jake Gyllenhaal (probably his best performance to date) and Michelle Monaghan, a tight, well-paced script by Ben Ripley and some very spare, stripped down, focused direction from Duncan Nolan and you get Source Code, a movie Philip K. Dick would have written and directed, if he'd ever tried his hand at such.<br/><br/>Gyllenhall plays a soldier, fresh from the war in Afghanistan, who wakes up in the body of another man and discovers (through various twists and turns, some predictable, others not) that he's the only one who can find out who placed the bomb on the train he and Monaghan are riding before that person inflicts an even bigger atrocity on the city of Chicago.<br/><br/>And he's got eight minutes.<br/><br/>The result is an hour and a half of thrill-a-minute action, a roller-coaster ride that will keep you guessing about some of its twists and turns, and an all around great movie.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up on this one. It's very definitely worth seeing and I'll be getting the Blu-Ray when it comes out later on this summer."
"ConstructiveCritic","7","0","1","2 April 2011"," A great start and a great ending
","As a big fan of Moon, I was admittedly expecting a lot from Source Code which was only further fueled by it's action packed/edge of the seat trailer. At the same time, I always knew it was going to be difficult to stay on track with an 8 minute changeover for the protagonist even at a shortish 93 minute runtime (the first and last 30 minutes of which are excellent) <br/><br/>With that said, I enjoyed Source Code, Gyllenhaal plays the leading role immensely and actually makes the audience believe that he could fall for his opposite, Michelle Monaghan, in the few minutes that they only spend together.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the movie would be that when outside the 'source code' the story gets boring very quickly and somewhere around the halfway mark, there is a 20/30 minute period that leaves you wondering if the movie has lost its way. Luckily it doesn't and there is an inception/shutter island-esque ending left with the viewers that will leave you thinking and hopeful of a DVD purchase to figure out what really happened!<br/><br/>Definitely worth its money as a cinema visit but I've heard there are possibilities of some alternate endings and great extras on the DVD so you might also want to wait it out for that!"
"davidgee","7","0","3","1 April 2011"," The two Jakes
","Early in the movie Jake Gyllenhaal looks into a mirror on the commuter train and sees Sean, the passenger he's been ""zapped"" into, staring back at him. This moment reveals the film's - to me - fatal flaw. Shouldn't we be looking at Sean in the train scenes and only see Jake in the time capsule scenes? Of course, this would limit Jake's screen time - unless he played Sean and the other actor played the time traveller.<br/><br/>You can imagine how this was pitched: INCEPTION meets UNSTOPPABLE with a bit of GROUNDHOG DAY and THE TIME-TRAVELLER'S WIFE thrown into the mix. The mix is a hell of a mish-mash. The film's dynamic pace - and Gyllenaal's considerable screen presence - carry the story past its many inconsistencies, but it's only fun while you're in the cinema. Its internal logic is flawed, particularly in the way it works up to a ""surprise"" ending which, when you think about it, isn't really that much of a surprise. How else could it have ended?"

","Only eight minutes to write this review. If I'm making any progress I'll get another eight minutes. Why eight not seven or nine, they'll tell you why with a straight face. They'll explain the ""Source Code"" as they know it. Everything is delivered as the gospel in this writer created science fiction world.<br/><br/>The characters are likable. Turns out Jake is half the man he use to be in this who's doing it action thriller. It's a serious ""Groundhog Day"" mostly on a train. The ""do-overs"" are changed enough to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>Will Jake find the bomb, the bomber, and save the world. Last time I looked Chicago was still there. As hard as it is to imagine there's even a Hollywood ending."
"harrmabb316","7","0","5","1 April 2011"," Duncan Jones seals his place among the top directors of today
","Most directors tend to stumble for their second film, others far exceed them while Duncan fits nicely in between those two extremes and follows up his very impressive debut, Moon, with this well-executed thriller.<br/><br/>While this is more mainstream than Moon was it doesn't make the film any less thought provoking and exciting, if anything it exceeded my expectations. Based on what the film industry is churning out recently this film particularly stands out for me.<br/><br/>But all the credit shouldn't be down to Duncan. The script is really well written with some smart dialogue and a cleverly crafted story that keeps you guessing. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a very convincing performance along with a great supporting cast that overall will make this film go down as probably one of the more underrated films this side of the summer blockbusters."
"skinhead-5","7","0","3","1 April 2011"," Mix up of films?
","A bit of a slow starter for this film but when finally gets going it's a fairly good enjoyable movie. Not too many surprises with this one though there are hints of several films and movie directions in it. Take the concept of Inception and Quantum Leap with a hint of Vantage point (you'll see this as the film moves on) and Final Destination with the repeating coffee and ticket inspector scenes.<br/><br/>There's a bit of everything in here but although the films lacks the punch of Inception. The acting from some of the people is a bit lacklustre and revolves more around the plot. However the resulting feeling of the whole film is that you leave the cinema a bit disappointed, not quite sure about the ending. I just get the impression the writers gave up or the budget was stretched so it seemed ""cut short"". Although just as you are about to grab your coat and get up there's a bit more of it. What is a big disappointed was the capture of the Derek Frost, they could of an effort on this one instead of leaving you wanting to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>While the plot is implausible I didn't think for one minute it was going to be an epic with the unknowns in it, but it makes up in effects."

There are similarities to Quantum Leap and that was a big selling point for me.
