","Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.<br/><br/>Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a ""no confidence good guy"". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into ""familiar gross-out"" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following ""Rock and Roll personified"". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.<br/><br/>For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies."

","This movie was great. I expected considering how much I enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and how much I enjoy Jonah Hill in general. I was not disappointed. The only reason that I did not give this movie a higher rating was because it was so ridiculous and unbelievable. I could not stop laughing out loud in the theater and neither could the rest of the audience (which was decent sized for a mid week night time showing after release). If you do not like drinking, drugs, and sex than I would recommend that you do not even come close to this one. It is above the top in all three of those aspects. You may be offended by some things, but that is the whole point of the movie... enjoy it. See it soon, I foresee this one growing in popularity as word of mouth spreads. 8/10."
"cadillac20","8","69","130","5 June 2010"," Very very funny
","When I saw the trailers for Greek, they looked moderately funny. I hadn't seen Sarah Marshal, so I had no idea what that was all about. But, reviews were good and I thought, hey, what the heck. What I found was a very funny Apatow-filmish take on the rock n roll film. All the elements of a usual Apatow troop film are there: focus on unusual moments, sex drugs and gross out humor, friendship and some serious moments, and the breaking down of typical film trappings. Suffice to say, this is a great summer comedy.<br/><br/>The film, as many know, charges Allen Green with getting washed up rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theater in LA for a 10th anniversary concert. As one would guess, things don't go accordingly, and a whole lot of comedy ensues. The film, more than anything, is essentially a rock pic. It's about the life of this rock star who has burned out his bulb and is attempting to put in a new one. And as Aldous Snow, Russel Brand is fantastic. He truly embodies this rock star and you feel he really IS this character. He boozes it up, drugs it up, sexes it up, and whatever other manner of things a rock star might abuse. He's a mess of a guy, and like so many famous people who have gone south, he's a complicated person who has let fame get the best of him. This is translated extremely well. Despite all the comedy, this is an excellent rock and roll biopic type film. Jonah Hill is great as the lead character with baggage of his own and he does what he does best here, although he plays a more awkward kind of character versus his geek-in- charge style that we're so accustomed too.<br/><br/>Stealing the show, however, is Sean Combs, who plays Green's boss Sergio. Every scene he is in is hilarious and he is surprisingly funny. It was definitely pleasant to see him pull off such a funny role. The other supporting characters are great, doing a fine job of being very funny themselves. Most of the film falls into stages of comedy bits, and all are pretty damned hilarious. There's nothing here that's too ridiculous, which is nice. There is once scene that kind of makes you raise a brow, but it's just so damn funny, you forget how insane it is. And that's really the charm of the film. Everything about it is larger than life, yet believable. This is exactly why it perfectly molds both the rock star film and an Apatow comedy so perfectly. It's the kind of comedy you would expect it to be, while not knowing exactly what is going to happen. If you don't like these kinds of comedies, this one may not be for you. But if you've enjoyed other films like Sarah Marshal, Pineapple Express, and other Apatow troop films, you'll find Greek hilarious. I know I did."
"desiplaya","Null","122","243","21 April 2010"," A Hilarious Spin-off
","I was lucky enough to see this movie tonight as an advanced screening at my school.<br/><br/>It is the funniest movie of the year so far and I think it will be a sleeper hit like The Hangover was last year. I loved Russel Brand's character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but I was bit hesitant to see an entire movie based around the character. If you feel the same way as I did, stop! This was an excellent spin off with a great cast. If you love movies like Superbad and The Hangover, you will not be disappointed with this. Although, don't go in expecting another Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which is more of a romantic comedy. This is just 108 minutes (approx) of pure fun and a lot of crude humor.<br/><br/>Russel Brand, Jonah Hill, and Diddy are flat out hilarious. I'll go far as to say that Diddy's character Sergio is to this movie as Russell Brand's Aldous Snow was to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. There are a lot of hilarious lines throughout the movie and a couple of awesome cameos.<br/><br/>I haven't laughed as much as I did tonight since I first saw The Hangover last year. If you love comedies, then don't miss this! I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Electrified_Voltage","6","29","52","28 March 2011"," I sure did laugh, but this spin-off eventually wears a little thin, and sometimes gets kind of disturbing
","The now very famous but widely despised Russell Brand made his breakthrough in 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", in which he played Aldous Snow, the lead singer of the fictional rock band, Infant Sorrow. In this 2010 spin-off sequel, the comedian got to reprise his role from the previous film, but this time, it was one of the two lead roles. As frightening as this may sound to a lot of people, I do think Brand is a funny comedian, and I found the 2008 Apatow Productions film he appeared in to be an overall funny and satisfying farce, so I was obviously interested in seeing this follow-up. I wasn't expecting ""Get Him to the Greek"" to be as good, and had noticed a lot of criticism of it, making my expectations a little lower. It turned out that I found it a LOT funnier than many others have, but it certainly doesn't stay as consistent as it could.<br/><br/>Infant Sorrow frontman Aldous Snow, whose current girlfriend is pop star Jackie Q, makes an album with his band called ""African Child"", with the title track as a single, but this turns out to be a critical and commercial disaster! The singer has now been sober for seven years, but his relationship with Jackie fails, and he relapses, abusing alcohol and illegal drugs again after all these years! This makes him spiral out of control and ruin his career! Meanwhile, Aaron Green is a lowly Los Angeles talent scout who works for Pinnacle Records, a company which is currently in a financial rut. He is also a hardcore Infant Sorrow fan, so he suggests to Pinnacle Records head Sergio Roma, who is looking for ideas to save the company, that they have Aldous perform at the Greek Theatre on the tenth anniversary of his big show at that venue. Sergio sends Aaron on a flight to London to escort the washed-up rock star to Los Angeles, and tells him he has 72 hours to get the man to the Greek Theatre. Unfortunately, several complications will make it difficult for Aaron and Aldous to make it to this major gig on time! <br/><br/>Aware of the criticism by the time I watched this, I thought maybe it really would turn out to be lame, and a major disappointment after ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", but that wasn't the case for me. I soon found myself laughing (sometimes lightly) as the film shows Aldous and his girlfriend and what goes wrong. More funny parts follow as we are introduced to Aaron Green and his life in L.A., and at this point, it helps that Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs is funny as the short-tempered Sergio Roma. There are times when the film lags around this point, but not usually. I think it gets funnier when Aaron meets Aldous in London, and we hear what Aldous' mother thinks of his father. On the flight back to the United States, the conversation between Aaron and Aldous is another comic highlight, with Aaron admitting what he really thinks of ""African Child"" and the Infant Sorrow frontman's reaction to this. The big laughs continue with all the problems these two characters face as the talent scout tries to get the singer to their destination before the time is up. Sure, there are some pretty lame gags, but these are fairly rare. However, after a while, it wears a bit thin, and it sometimes gets kind of disturbing with Aldous' drug problems and what happens when he gets Aaron to smoke some of these drugs without the talent scout knowing, though I'm certainly not saying that it's all straight-faced from this point on.<br/><br/>Other viewers can hate this movie and look down on anyone who likes it all they want, but after watching such lousy attempts at comedy as ""Ed"", ""My Boss's Daughter"", and ""The Master of Disguise"" recently, I have to say that this one is a LOT funnier than those! ""Get Him to the Greek"" is the first comedy I've seen in a few weeks that has actually made me laugh a lot, so I have to give it credit for that! Still, even all those bad comedies didn't make this one look like a work of genius to me, as I could still see the flaws in it, which eventually get more significant as the movie progresses. Since this is another effort from Apatow Productions, you can obviously expect it to be very raunchy, and some scenes could gross you out, but even if you can take this and are prepared for it, and even if you like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", you could find ""Get Him to the Greek"" disappointing. Still, while many would disagree, I certainly think it could have been MUCH worse, and it can obviously please certain audiences."

","Unexpectedly funny, with many celebrity cameos, very grotesque on-drugs characters... Develops the same charm as ""Fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" while maintaining a certain message and character development.<br/><br/>The movie picks up issues most people (obviously - judging by other review s here on IMDb - not all) have thought or dreamed about. How would it be to go anywhere anytime you want, have any woman you want, use drugs whenever you want. Would it be a lonely life, is it destructive? What would you do or react if you were thrown into such a lifestyle, if only for a few days?<br/><br/>This movie made me laugh heartily while giving me things to think about. Absolutely grand and absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>WARNING: Expect this movie to be an underachiever concerning ratings because of moralists all over the world though. So if you're an open minded person, easily add 20% to your average rating and enjoy!<br/><br/>Very fun movie."

","They should have called this movie ""My Favorite Rock Star"" because ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller scenarist Jason Segel look like the Peter O'Toole comedy ""My Favorite Year"" inspired them. Pinnacle Record President Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) is searching for a surefire hit to keep his brood of kids in Air Jordans when an intern Aaron Green (Jonah Hill of ""Super Bad"") suggest that they stage a comeback concert at the Greek Theater for washed up British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"")whose career tanked after he produced an album called ""African Child."" Sergio packs Aaron off on a trans-Atlantic flight to London to pick up Snow and bring him back in 72 hours. Meanwhile, Aaron and his live-in girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss of ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"") are having relationship woes. She is a hospital intern who is worked so hard that she doesn't get to spend much time with Aaron. She finds a job in Seattle that would give them more time together, but it would force Aaron to look for a new job. They decide to break up and Aaron flies off to England. Of course, the comedy here is that Aldous is a drugged-out rock & roller who cannot get enough booze and narcotics into his system while straight-laced Aaron does his best to keep him off drugs and get him onto the plane. The irony is that Aaron eventually winds up doing all of Aldous's narcotics. At one point, Aaron has to stuff a ball of heroin up his anus so that the two of them can slip past the airport checkers. Aaron discovers what it is like to be a free-wheeling, drugged out guy and gets laid once in a bathroom by a woman and later is raped by a drugged out Vegas chick called Destiny who stuffs a dildo up his butt while she straddles him in bed. Indeed, poor Aaron does virtually everything to nurse maid Aldous to the concert. The jokes are not that funny and the formulaic characters are far from sympathetic, despite the fact that Aldous redeems himself and Aaron becomes Aldous' producer. Incidentally, Aaron and Daphne hook back up and make it to Seattle. Sean Combs delivers one of the funniest performances and Colm Meaney of ""Con Air"" isn't far behind him as Aldous' father Jonathan Snow. Kristen Bell appears in a cameo."
"stmaartengirl45","5","57","113","10 June 2010"," Was expecting more laughs.
","I kept hearing Get Him to the Greek, being compared to The Hangover, which I loved and thought extremely funny. Get Him to the Greek was at times more disturbing, pathetic, and gross than funny. I should have waited for it to come out on video. Normally you can hear people laugh around you, but I do not recall hearing anyone really laughing. My son, son-in-law and daughter also saw it. They said they liked it but they usually will instantly start talking about the movie and playing out some of the scenes, but that did not happen either. So it leads me to feel, they were not very thrilled by it. My son actually said he could have done without the threesome scene. They all agreed, not near as good as The Hangover."
"annejenningsparis","10","76","155","5 June 2010"," Surprisingly Outstanding
","Many people won't get this movie, because it moves so quickly from extreme comedy to near tragedy, but that's the whole point of the film. Russell Brand is near genius in his portrayal of an out-of-control rock star has been, and Jonah Hill, for once, plays the low-key straight man. Another standout is Sean Combs as an over-the-top music exec. My husband and I saw this on a date, and we both loved it. Granted, it has plenty of profanity and some gross-out moments, but I felt all of those contributed to the message of the movie, which was about the extreme nature of the rock and roll lifestyle. Funny, poignant, and ultimately a feel-good story about friendship and forgiveness--and rock and roll!"
"jsavage8282","1","58","118","18 November 2010"," t's an acquired humor that I will never find funny._spoiler_
","After watching this movie, I am pretty sure I will never watch anything by this director or anything starring Russell Brand or Jonah Hill. The movie was quite distasteful with the idea that you should help your friends by doing anything you can even if it includes: over abuse of drugs, dropping off the wounded in front of a hospital, sticking drugs in your rectum in an airport, and ridiculous kinds of unnecessary sex (some in bathrooms - gross, suggested and almost forced threesomes, cheating). So your health means nothing as long as your friends or your work are satisfied with your loyalty? I should mention there was a quasi-rape scene that was absolutely unnecessary. Not a woman being raped, but Jonah Hill with a dildo. Wow, not something I'd ever like to see or think about. By the way, if you were ""jones-ing"" to see Jonah Hill's overweight bare naked bottom, then this is the movie for you! No thank you. Not only was the movie semi-musical, but the songs were treacherous and completely stupid in context. <br/><br/>I have seen other things with Russell Brand and Jonah Hill, two comedic actors. Two actors that I have not found the least bit funny among actors such as, Jason Segel and Seth Rogan. I always thought this was due to their roles being minor in certain movies. Instead, I was right with my own judgment that I should have not seen this movie - even though I saw it.... This movie was not worth watching, making, or filming. It's an acquired humor that I will never find funny."
"legalguru36","1","44","87","19 June 2010"," The longer it goes, the worse and worse it gets.
","Anyone who thinks this is good must be taking the same drugs that Russell Brand's character is in the movie. First off, you know going in with Apatow that it's probably not going to be a thought provoking, compelling storyline, so the comedy HAS to carry the film. Sadly (and honestly painfully) it doesn't, not even close. This is one of Apatow's worst films, if not THE worst. Jonah is funny to a point, but what was fresh with him (Superbad)in the past, to me has gotten old very quickly. There are a few instances that are funny, but nowhere near enough (tired, old, unoriginal bits we've seen before) and nowhere close to as funny as ""The Hangover"" (it was advertised to be), ""Superbad,"" or ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" The whole bit with Snow and his father is pointless (it's neither funny nor do they re-examine that relationship). The movie just drags on and on, not being funny, and they should have cut it by at least 30 minutes. After a short amount of time you just say ""Uncle,"" and hope that it ends."
"thesubstream","8","45","92","5 June 2010"," So much puke
","It's not quite Pixar-like, Judd Apatow's streak of very funny, very good films, but it's close. As a producer, he's as close as it gets to Mr. Automatic, going from Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy to The 40-Year-Old Virgin to Talladega Nights to Superbad to Pineapple Express with only a couple Year One's and Walk Hard's to queer the run. Apatow's done it the right way, by surrounding himself with a gang of truly funny people and by recognizing what a lot of timid, gloss-obsessed Hollywood folks won't: that guys like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Steve Carell and Seth Rogan could carry pictures. They're all... these are odd-looking dudes, these Apatowian fellas, and it's hard to make them look good blown up billboard size. But all of them can write their own jokes, all of them are funny, and as Hill proves in the new Get Him to the Greek, all of them can carry the weight of a big film on their back, despite their schlubbiness, despite the films not being SNL spin-offs. There's just talent and comedy, that's both fresh and charmingly old-fashioned. With Get Him to the Greek there's a weird bit of Hollywood story/actor oddness that evaporates as soon as the picture gets rolling: writer/director Nicholas Stoller is taking characters from a previous film that he directed (that was written by and starred Jason Segel), Forgetting Sarah Marshall, keeping one intact (Russel Brand's rock god Aldous Snow) and slightly tweaking one other (Jonah Hill's disturbed-fan maître d' becomes a shy music intern), and sets them loose in a completely unconnected narrative. Snow is the last true rockstar, recently fallen hard off the wagon post-a disastrous, career-threatening single about starvation in Africa called ""African Child"". Worried about slumping record sales and a label-head (the surprisingly entertaining Sean ""Diddy"" Combs) looking for ""the next thing"", intern Aaron Green (Hill) suggests the company return to its rock roots and sponsor a gig at the Greek theatre in L.A., to mark the 10th anniversary of a legendary Aldous Snow show. Green is sent to London to collect him, packing an adrenaline shot and instructions to do whatever it takes to get the slippery, deluded, hard-partying rock god to L.A. in three days. Very funny hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Brand as Snow is the spectacle, the wild spark that animates the whole film. Snow vacillates wildly from petulant artistic preciousness to aggressive junkie posturing to anarchic drug logic and back. Story-wise, tt's a dangerous thing to chance, as the rock-excess thing has been parodied to near-death. Brand, though, limns the edges of his chaos with occasional moments of human frailty. The film notes late in the going that Snow's self-appointed rock messiah is intelligent, and it's a small ignorable moment that speaks to the subtle bits of originality in the film's script and in Brand's performance: he's a pompous idiotic waster in true rock fashion, but there's a cruel, manipulative intelligence underneath it all that helps the whole film feel fresh and funny, even if it's going over well-trod Spinal Tap ground.<br/><br/>The discovery of the film, though, is Jonah Hill as Aaron Green, the spectacular punching bag at the heart of a film that mercilessly visits every kind of humiliation and degradation on him. He stands square in the furnace blast of Snow's rock-superstar excess and the shrivelling, repeated ""mind f__ks"" of his conniving, unbalanced boss: he pukes, he's sexually assaulted by more than one person, he's threatened, cursed, party to a stabbing. But what makes Hill's performance truly funny is that while he is in essence a nebbish, a victim, a barf-coated ill-looking cannonball of a man he nonetheless retains a really kind of compelling dignity and oddly endearing self-confidence. There's a depth to Hill's performance in this film (and in Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well) that's actually special. He's not an oversize wild-man, he's not a tiny Michael Cera-esquire mumbler. He's doing something new, and it along with everything else in this film is very very funny. 8/10"
"tomgillespie2002","5","31","62","3 June 2011"," A film of two halves
","The comedy films of writer/producer/director Judd Apatow have somewhat dominated the last eight years or so. As well as being commercial hits, they have been lauded by critics for their sweet approach to comedy, blended with gross-out aspects and genuinely good scriptwriting. Apart from his best works - The 40-Year Old Virgin, Superbad, Knocked Up - his films can often be lazy, relying on quirky randomness to get through. The overrated Anchorman, which has somehow become a massive cult hit, was the biggest example of this, and although I could watch Will Ferrell all day, the film just felt like it was desperately trying to get through to the other side. Get Him To The Greek is another example of this.<br/><br/>Music producer Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) convinces his somewhat angry boss (Sean Combs) that an anniversary concert for failing rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is the way forward. Convinced, Green is sent to London to collect Snow and take him on a few promotional spots before arriving back in America for his concert. Snow would rather have endless parties, take lots of drugs, and sleep with lots of women - which is okay with Green, only he has an angry boss on his ass and a girlfriend (played by Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss) who he's not sure has broken up with him or not.<br/><br/>This is really a film of two halves. The first being genuinely funny - with Brand breathing likability into his somewhat loathsome character, and the exchanges between Hill and Diddy being a particular highlight. This is coming from a person that hates Russell Brand. I mean I really, really hate him. But the charm that everyone else seems to see only becomes apparent to me when on the screen. Here he reprises his role from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, where I was surprised with his comic timing. When the second half comes around, I began hating him again.<br/><br/>The film simply runs out of ideas, throwing in a troubled father-son relationship between Brand and his Las Vegas-based father Jonathan Snow (Colm Meaney) that is of no interest. It also throws up one of the unfunniest scenes in the film, with Hill being smashed on a 'jeffrey' (a mix up of a variety of drugs smoked like a joint) and stroking a furry wall while Brand and Meaney fight. It resorts to scenes like this because it has no more jokes to tell, and combined with Aldous Snow's increasingly crap and unfunny array of songs, it all feels like it just wants to end.<br/><br/>Sadly, a more interesting sub-plot that reveals Snow's serious drug habit crops up then seemingly fades out without being properly explored. It could have added another dimension to Snow's character, and stopped him becoming a whiny and annoying protagonist. That said, the first half is funny enough to make it worth a watch, and Sean Combs near enough steals the entire film.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

From the start of the movie, I was already alarmed that I had chosen the wrong movie what with the music video and the switching between the various newscast of Aldos Snow. I thought it would get better once we get into the meat of the story. I thought Jonah Hill will bust out a few good jokes, but most of the jokes just make me cringe instead of laugh. By the one hour mark, I wanted to leave, but stayed which is a mistake. In the end when he finally got to the concert, I thought it would be over, but no, they had to prolong it another little bit to extend the bore. I went in expecting something close to The Hangover and instead got 90 minutes of swearing and a few flashes of nudity. I don't know how anyone can rate this a 7 out of 10 or more."

He does it well and leaves us with a strong and convincing performance, but then It's hard to criticise his acting when he for the most part just plays himself, and to that point he does it well as always. <br/><br/>The story-line is basic but strong, and doesn't skimp on the laughs... or the nauseating, leaving the theater in stitches and disgust several times throughout.

The one interesting thing I liked was the link with the Sarah Marshal movie and the commercial for her upcoming T.V. show. Even though that wasn't one of my favorite films either, it was a whole lot better than this piece of crap. I have to add more just to get the minimum 10 lines, so I'll add that I only went to this film because of the 7 plus rating I saw here. It was between this film and Grown Ups, and that had less than 4 stars. My guess is that Grown Ups will turn out to be a better film; not that I expect that much from it either.

If there was supposed to be a message, it was lost in the tsunami of bodily functions, profanity, drugs and alcohol that never stopped. <br/><br/>All in all, a waste of time and money to anyone outside the 13-25 demographic. Then again, that's where the cash must be nowadays, Hollywood keeps targeting them almost to the exclusion of the rest of us."

I think the money would be better served and less angry at me for spending it towards something so repulsive. This group of guys in high school that must have been total nobodies, must have gotten together and thought of scripts for all these movies brain storming on the raunchiest, most sexist, degrading, cliché, nasty crap without ANY substance what so ever! and thought ""hey, maybe people will be ghetto and dumb enough to actually like this"" I honestly think I would enjoy getting served crap on a plate than to have to sit through another one of these immature, offensive, ""shock-value"" type movies. Its hard being an intelligent person in this world, movies are limited. To sum up the movie, a low intelligent film of a rocker with the topless women, strippers, drugs, and plain stupidity with lame jokes.

Its a train wreck and paying money for this or to even see this is a total waste. I think people should instead donate money to these guys in the movies for acting school and to the directors for a psychotherapist to talk about their women issues. Cause they are clearly angry women haters who feel to the need to humiliate, degrade, and insult women on a constant basis and who have absolutely no respect for women nor their bodies. Degrading a person because of their sex or their body is not funny, its stupid and shows lack of character and immaturity. Can these directors seriously not make a movie without insulting women? are they incapable? Movies can be funny without belittling a sex.

","I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this movie last week in Las Vegas and there was a short Q&A with Russel Brand and Jonah Hill after the screening. <br/><br/>I would say this movie is a solid 7.5 out of 10, but that isn't really an option. The comedy in this movie lands well almost all of the time, and the story more or less takes a backseat to the comedy until the final 30 minutes or so. <br/><br/>That is really the only part where the movie falls short. The story putters along adding more and more along the way, and the closing struggles to wrap it all up because it doesn't do anything to invest itself along the way. But the whole idea of the movie is to put the story in the backseat and have the audience enjoy the ride of the loosely stringed together jokes, and that is where it shines.<br/><br/>T.J. Miller (notable from Cloverfield and She's Out of My League) has a fantastic turn as a concierge that Aaron has a short run-in with. Rose Byrne does a fantastic job of moderately offending you while making you laugh, and it is a definite departure from her past roles. There are plenty of fantastic cameos that serve their purpose to elevate the comedy to another level. <br/><br/>By far, Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs steals the show as Sergio. The natural biased to accepting him as an actor dissolves by the time his first scene is over and you're too busy laughing to care anymore. The power of the comedy that was wrote for him overpowers your want for an actor you thought would be better suited for the role. It isn't until the hotel- chase sequence that you realize the casting was perfect for him.<br/><br/>This film sets out to make you laugh and does exactly that in spades. The only qualms come from the story aspect, and when you're going to see a movie like this you shouldn't ever expect too terribly much from the story. ""Get Him to the Greek"" is extremely funny, easily watchable, and does its semi-source material (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) justice."

I would have liked the film to be more about him but he's fine with the role he has.<br/><br/>Its more and less a remake of ""My Favorite Year"" which had Peter O Tool but it lacks that film's showmanship. The film had potential but outside of a few moments of really funny material ( All thanks to Sean P Diddy Combs), there is really nothing here that can't wait for DVD."

","As a spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the movie uses many of the same characters, even if some of them appear only briefly, and the story focuses on one of the most interesting and entertaining of those characters, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Aldous Snow returns as the eccentric British rock star that is at times very wise and likable and at other times a complete douche.<br/><br/>Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) works for Sergio Roma (Sean Combs), a soulless, money hungry music producer that gives Aaron the unenviable task of getting Aldous Snow sober enough to perform an anniversary concert that will revitalize his defunct music career. Aldous Snow is very uncooperative and his antics lead to a series of funny misadventures for both himself and poor Aaron Green. You really want to not like Aldous but there is something about him that is too charming to resist and you end up rooting for him to crawl out from the bottle/needle/pipe/pill bottle/etc. and get his life back on track.<br/><br/>While Jonah Hill and Russel Brand are the stars of the movie, the supporting cast is also very entertaining and funny. Sean Combs is particularly amusing, as is the dysfunctional relationship between Aaron Green and his girlfriend Daphne Binks (Elisabeth Moss). Get Him to the Greek is a very lighthearted and entertaining comedy that I soon hope to own on DVD. If you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshal you will love this film."

Brand plays Snow, who has just suffered a catastrophic flop in album sales, fallen out with his girlfriend and has fallen off the wagon.<br/><br/>What he needs is a comeback, and what a better way to do it than have a ten year anniversary show of his legendary Greek performance. The only problem is, Hill has to get him there from London on time.<br/><br/>As the old saying goes 'life imitating art', Brand almost plays himself as the Lothario Snow, who knows no bounds, and he is wonderful in every element. He is funny yes, but you can see when the guy is being dramatic, and he really turns into what should have been a stereotypical rock star, into a human being with emotions and weaknesses you really show empathy for.<br/><br/>Hill is really Brands fall guy, but he is funny in his own right, and the two have a great time on screen when they are together.<br/><br/>As you would expect from an Apatow production, there are big laughs, and some very uncomfortable set pieces always involving Hill, but you cannot help but watch whilst you are cringing.<br/><br/>The funniest part in my opinion has to be the ;Jeffrey' scene. It's impossible to explain, but it had me laughing for at least five minutes. There are also some random lines such as 'you look like Dennis Quaid' which are just so silly you cannot help but laugh.<br/><br/>It's slickly made well edited and the music is very good, with some hilarious support from Combs and Byrnes.<br/><br/>It may not translate well to people who are not familiar with Brand, but if you are, you'll know what to expect.<br/><br/>Very funny."

Jonah Hill isn't funny at all in this film and Russell Brand is probably better served as a supporting actor because his comedic routine gets old very fast. The best role comes from Rose Byrne who unfortunately only spends about 15 minutes on screen, the interactions between her and Brand's character as the highlight of the movie and it probably would've been 10x more entertaining had they just focused the film strictly on the relationship of those two odd characters.If you enjoy overacting and simple punchlines, this movie will be right up your alley, otherwise do yourself a favor and save ten bucks."

","We're normal people, we live normal lives and go about our daily tasks. But what if for a couple of weeks, we got to hang out with Montley Crue who you could easily say was one of hard rock's most crazy bands and has some extreme stories that one could only dream to tell. We could never party the way they did or any other hard rock band, but we don't even have that type of a band any more. But in Get him to the Greek we have one last rock star who does and that's Aldous Snow. A spin off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, this movie capitalizes on it's most favorite character. However even though he does remember dating Sarah Marshall, Jonah Hill is a completely different character from Forgetting Sarah Marshall. So I wasn't sure if this was a continue on Adous Snow's character or the story. But let's assume that it's different, this falls into the more predictable comedies. We'll have some gross out jokes, some weird forced jokes, then gross out jokes and a heart felt message that makes you just go ""awww"" at the end.<br/><br/>Rock star Aldous Snow releases an album and an accompanying single ""African Child."" The song and music video flops, is banned and called ""the worst thing to happen to Africa"". His girlfriend Jackie Q takes custody of their son, Naples, and leaves him; as a result, Aldous hits rock bottom by drinking and doing drugs excessively once again. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Aaron Green works as a low-level talent scout at Pinnacle Records. Pinnacle Records has lost a lot of money, so the head of the company, Sergio Roma, asks for ideas. Green proposes to have Aldous Snow play at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles for the tenth anniversary of a particularly famous performance there. One month later, he sends Aaron to London to retrieve Aldous. After retrieving Aldous from his apartment, Aaron tries desperately to control Aldous' rambunctious behavior, which causes them to miss several flights. They bar-hop across the city for several hours, leaving a trail of women and alcohol. Taking Aaron on a ride that even Montley Crue would say to chill out on, he parties like a true rock star.<br/><br/>The one thing that I could say that got a huge laugh out of me with this movie was Sean Combs aka ""P. Diddy"". Him at the end with Aldous trying to bring Aaron back to life from an overdose and P. Didddy is just fighting with all these people and then gets hit by a car while running in the streets was just priceless. There are some occasional good moments in this movie, but I would say that over all it's forgettable. There wasn't anything special about it and I liked having Aldous just in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, here he seems so forced on you that you have to like him because he parties. I also found the scene in the airport where Aldous asks Aaron to shove drugs up his behind very unbelievable. Come on, no one saw that while he was doing it in public?! Then let's add in Aaron puking every 5 seconds, how is that funny? The movie just seemed so forced and could have been so much better with another writer. It's a rental, that's about it, it has a few chuckles, but it's nothing special.<br/><br/>4/10"

I am really really surprised at the amount of good reviews on here. I suppose if you are a big fan of Russell Brands humor that would help. I am not. While I still thought forgetting Sarah Marshall was funny, Aldous Snow, ( Brand's character) was not my favorite part at all..so maybe I have should have known better. Regardless, while the movie opens up in a promising way, with an almost funny mock music video of Brand's character entitled African Child--the movie seems thrown together, unbelievable and unoriginal, (for example, the over the top mock music video of Brand's pop singer ex-lover has been done before exactly in ""Music and Lyrics""), and it was overall far too long and just not funny to me, my friends, and apparently the entire theatre, judging from the awkward silence. While i'm all for goofy Apatow comedies and the like, I wouldn't want anyone to waste their time on this one. Unless you love Russell Brand. Then you'll probably like it."

After flying to London and making contact with Aldus, Aaron suddenly realizes this is going to be tougher than expected. Aldus Snow seems more interested in showing Aaron the ""best night of his life"", so off they go on an almighty all-day bender. After this intense night of partying and missing about 4 flights, he finally gets him on to the plane and he can finally relax, mission accomplished.<br/><br/>This was the end of the movie, for me.

I snickered a little, I went hmmmm, I smiled a bit but as far as genuine gut-busters there were hardly any. As it wore on I started paying close attention to the audience (and this was 9pm on a Friday night, where many folks on first dates were desperate to latch on to a shared experience like, say, laughing together) and found they were behaving exactly as I. Scattered laughs from different parts of the theater, but no communal hilarity where the whole audience cracks up as one. The Apatow cash cow snuffed it on this one. Clearly the company is more focused on being prolific than funny and it shows.

"wakemeup36","1","14","33","13 October 2010"," Recycled, unfunny garbage
","Whatever happened to witty and smart comedy films like Monty Python, Airplane! and Spaceballs? They got replaced by films like this one that shouldn't appeal to any one over 13.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this movie you ask? Everything. The plot, the characters, the 'humour', everything. Let's start with the plot. Some guy (who's exact job isn't made very clear in the movie) is supposed to get an 'out of control' rockstar to a concert. In doing so, 'hilarious' antics ensue which I will cover later in the review. What I hate about this plot is that the rockstar life is portrayed so negatively. Drugs, drinking, degradation of women. According to the movie, that's what rock n roll is all about. The music? Oh no, that has nothing to do with being a rockstar (OK, I'm exaggerating, but the music part is kept very minimal throughout the film). And of course, the film has the obligatory sappy part and a 'everything's fine and dandy' ending.<br/><br/>As for the characters, they're all just so annoying! The main character, played by Jonah Hill, is an overweight, useless person who continues being everyone's welcome mat to wipe their feet on. His girlfriend, played by ... umm ... some random good looking chick, manages to be a busy surgeon and an obnoxious 'Oh.Em.Gee' teenager at the same time. Sean Diddy plays the boss, and is as much of a scumbag in this movie he probably is in real life. The rockstar, played by Russel Brand also makes me want tear my hair apart due to his extremely irritating 'I'm a rockstar and therefore better than you' attitude.<br/><br/>The 'humour'. Where do I start? Barfing, pooping, drug use, overuse of alcohol, breast exposure and other forms of female degradation are common. Sean Diddy pulls out jokes which would be considered very racially insensitive if it wasn't for the fact he is black himself (I consider these jokes offensive anyway). Swearing is obviously very common and is never used in a humorous fashion. There are a lot of awkward moments in the film too which are supposed to be funny. But the filmmakers forgot one thing. If there is no humour applied to awkward moments, they are just that, awkward and not funny, not by a long stretch. Then there's this scene where the obligatory crazy chick takes out a dildo and rapes the main character. This is supposed to be hysterical, but I think any sane person will find it awfully disturbing more than anything. The only somewhat redeemable joke was the little Lars Ulrich/Napster reference. But that doesn't make up for the fact that there is so much tasteless 'humour' and also the fact that Lars' cameo is pretty much wasted.<br/><br/>This is a terrible film. An example of how much Hollywood has dumbed itself down, at least in terms of the comedy genre. But what's even sadder is, that most people have swallowed this as a good comedy flick. I'd honestly watch Epic Movie 60 times over in a row than call this a good movie. Yes, it's that bad."

I just don't find them funny, and yes, you are going to crucify me, but I'm talking about 'The Hangover,' 'Pineapple Express,' and all those sorts of films. I don't find people getting wasted, or stoned funny. Needless to say, I did not like 'Get Him To Greek.' It was just another blur of cussing, sex, drugs, and drinking, with a half-hearted and vague moral thrown in there just to save face. Something about monogamy and sobriety tucked into the last couple minutes that I could tell the producers didn't believe but just inserted so they wouldn't be criticized for their promotion of these reckless behaviors.<br/><br/>But I seem to be the only one on this boat.

What ensues is a not so tedious but hilarious battle to get Aldous to where he needs to be whist enjoying a 'Jeffrey', some furry wall stroking, late night partying (including a cameo from a certain Harry Potter villain), plane hopping and even a few poignant moments where you see a bit more to the troubled rock star. It's not a complicated plot and doesn't require you to think very hard but that's not the aim here. The film makes for a great night out and judging by the roars of laughter emanating from the audience it's safe to say other people are of the same opinion.<br/><br/>Brand is excellent once again as the debauched character but is most definitely not the only reason to watch. Jonah Hill is as funny and awkward as ever and the two make a great double act as the straight and funny comedy act . P Diddy for me is shining star here, I wasn't aware of his great comic timing and the script writers quite rightly gave him some stonking one liners which were delivered with gusto."

","I don't get it.<br/><br/>Did a bunch of people actually agree to spend money and time and effort on this putrid pile of excreta without having their kids and pet dogs held at gun-point? I'm disturbed at the amount of good reviews this movie is generating. Do people really find scenes where a character is forced to shove a packet of drugs up his rectum (in an airport security line no less!) and then is forced to expel it out again- funny? Seriously? Like. Really? This could have been tear-your-eyes-out funny (c'mon! you had Russel Brand to play with!), but the film-makers don't know when to quit being crass and excessively OTT with racist, sexist, juvenile humor. And who the heck okayed Sean Diddy for ANY role, he can't act much less be comedic! I wanted to slap him silly every time he came on screen and masticated his lines. Come to think of it, I wanted to slap everyone silly for wasting 109 minutes of my life! Note to Jonah Hill- Just being fat isn't funny. For the love of Gawd, go on a diet and invest in a treadmill and make a movie of that. I guarantee it will be a huge success.<br/><br/>The ONLY redeeming part were the songs. Sad, right? But I actually found them funnier and quite original than this entire depressing premise."

","A dreadful unfunny mess for which Director Nicholas Stoller should take full responsibility . Russell Brand is a charismatic talent, Jonah Hill who plays opposite him as record company executive Aaron Green is not. The equal billing and screen time they receive, presumably for the benefit of American audiences, holes the film below the water line from the start. Hill is not up to it, and is miscast. The visual attraction of a tall handsome louche Brand and a short fat ugly Hill,I can accept. What I cannot accept is the total lazy confusion of what happens around them.<br/><br/>The idea is fine, that of a washed up rock star, Aldous Snow, whose career is to be rejuvenated by a 10th anniversary concert . Green is charged with the task of getting Snow from London to the Greek Theatre in LA. That provides a platform for the straight Hill to be subjected to rock n roll depravity by Brand, but the mix doesn't work. Hill is not written as a foil for Brand, instead he has equal status and the energy drains from the film with every camera shot of him.<br/><br/>Record Company President Sergio Roma, played by Sean Combs,is a character with promise which is wrecked by overuse of profanity and one dimensional characterisation. Beyond that every stereotype, writing by numbers, and cliché supporting cast that you could ever have hallucinated about in your worst nightmares appears here.<br/><br/>The DVD contains an alternative opening and finale, both of which are far superior to those which are on the final edit. In the theatre version a messy, ambiguous, video shoot for Snows latest single is presented as a potential trailer or promo and is highly irritating. The alternative conventional scene of a country house launch party with the video being screened and other characters introduced makes far more sense. Equally a tedious official finish at the inevitably successful concert is vastly inferior to a quite witty alternative . the many deleted and alternative scenes are testament to the fact that Stoller seriously lost the plot here.<br/><br/>The music is uniformly bad, many scenes are superfluous and boring, and the clichés about a rock n roll lifestyle choke the life out of the story. How Stoller and co-writer Jason Segal could have so succeeded with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but failed so abjectly with this is a mystery. Although not the worst film I have ever seen, it is close run thing."
"colinrgeorge","4","9","20","29 June 2010"," Poorly Structured; A Different 'Greek Theater' May Have Helped
","Until this past weekend, I'd never sat through a film as literally the only audience member. So that's new.<br/><br/>Granted, it's been nearly a month since the initial release of ""Get Him to the Greek,"" and admittedly, the screening was before noon on a Sunday, but it's an experience that couldn't help but enunciate exactly how often I wasn't laughing. The silences practically echoed.<br/><br/>However, the scenario was hardly the film's sole detractor; the Apatow-produced comedy was, in many ways, the polar opposite of what I expected. From a structural standpoint, I anticipated there being a harder driving force; I thought the plot—Which sees Russell Brand reprising the role of debaucherous rocker Aldous Snow from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""— would consist of a series of escalating outlandish and out-of-hand party sequences with the omnipresent ticking clock to keep it dramatically grounded.<br/><br/>But if anything, ""Get Him to the Greek"" is not only pointlessly cyclical in how it stacks its scenes, but cause and effect are tossed clear out the window. The gist of it is that the irresponsible Snow must be chaperoned (Cue Jonah Hill as record company intern Aaron Green) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles for an anniversary concert in 72 hours. Writer/director Nicholas Stoller sets up countless potential snags for Green, such as Snow forgetting his commitment altogether, and the duo running impossibly late for their flight, but renders nearly every plot device irrelevant within ten minutes of its introduction. There's no potential for suspense when resolution is always a few easy lines of dialogue or a scene transition away.<br/><br/>""Will he make it?"" should be the audience's imperative question, and I mean, of course he will, but it's like Stoller isn't even trying to make us squirm. Then again, his script is so heavy with missed opportunity that frustration and boredom may produce the identical effect.<br/><br/>And just when his story should be roaring to a climax, it all but sputters out. Our heroes make it to LA with time to spare, which they then spend mending spats with their significant others—A transparent and lazy attempt at adding depth to this lightheaded farce. It allows Snow to have his obligatory existential crisis before the show—Only to be reaffirmed by Green, acting for the first time, as a friend.<br/><br/>This has grazed into spoiler territory, I guess, so let me pitch you a better ending while we're here. After much trial and tribulation, Snow and Green arrive at the venue with moments to spare. The lights are down; Snow steps on stage and belts out the first song. He is met with the rousing applause of just a few hundred fans. Reality check. Now he can have his existential crisis. In finally coming to terms with his diminishing career, his friendship with Green is made all the more poignant, and his comeback single (which the film already goes out on) is all the more triumphant.<br/><br/>It's not hard to rewrite a film that so narrowly jukes its own potential. I sought out ""Get Him to the Greek,"" even four weeks late, because I was sold on the trailer. The premise is strong, and the Brand/Hill combo under the Apatow umbrella seemed like a sure thing. The bottom line is it's not all that funny; but even more disappointingly, its narrative backbone is flimsy. If a great story had been locked in, and had I felt even momentarily unsure that he would be gotten to said Greek, those echoing silences might not have mattered.<br/><br/>But when I'm not invested in the story, and I'm not laughing, I become painfully aware that I'm the sole occupant of a silent two hundred seat theater."
"atticismic","4","10","23","10 June 2010"," This is basically just Russell Brand's life
","Most every scene in here is meant to showcase Aldous Snow's rock n' roll lifestyle, which are actually all the past autobiographical experiences of Russell Brand. Russell Brand does dress like that, his mother does push food instead of love (though he doesn't live with her), he did try boxing his estranged father as some kind of creepy Oedipal christening, he was a heroin addict that made many trades in Camden Town through kissing the beads from the dealer, and his methods of transportation for his narcotics is the same as the one excruciatingly drawn out in the film, and I'm sure he had many similar scandalous relations with women and men similar to as seen in the film. R. Brand has relapses. R. Brand has taken drug-crazed road trips through the desert and holds some heroin-haze encrusted truths (like the ones Jonah comes up with in the car ride to LA), still like gold to his dear muddled little heart and until a year ago thought it was groundbreaking and revolutionary to give them away on TV interviews and the like. And most of all, he loves being self destructive and feeling sorry for himself through his art. The only thing I can find in the film not ""branded"" by the (made public) past that runs through youtube and his autobiography is Jonah Hill and Elizabeth Moss's stretched for time relationship and her status as a doctor. Left field. So we all know now, much as we did before, that Russell Brand can't act, he can only play himself. So this is a fantastic movie if you want to see Mr. Brand taking himself too seriously. Even in acting he has too much earnest sincerity beneath the veil of making fun of himself; It makes him a great human personality and relatable media character, but only is truly funny when he relates to us about himself aka his day job, stand-up comedy. I think this movie is the life Brand likes to think he had for himself and this hinders the viewer if they don't understand this because everything is blown so far out of proportion and none of it is in any way relatable even for a spasm of a second (except for that bit with Jonah's girlfriends bad hours), that it's much better as farce seen (through Nick Stoller's interpretation of) thru the eyes of Russell and those who know him than another Apatow comedy. Some people would say if you have to look through the eyes of the creator, it's not a true work of art- but of course it's not, it's Russell Brand."

","Do you remember the movie, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""? Remember, the guy from that movie, played by Russell Brand? He portrayed a fictional rock star named Aldous Snow. Yeah, I like that guy. Guess what, he has his own movie called ""Get Him to the Greek"", with Jonah Hill and P. Diddy. Yeah, the movie is about Jonah Hill who helps Aldous get his career back, and send him to the Greek Theatre in L.A. for his 10th anniversary concert. Yeah, and throughout the trip, they get into some drunken chaos. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Anyways, back to my reality voice. ""Get Him to the Greek"" was actually a super funny movie, and it was fun to see Russell Brand's hilarious character again after so long since ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". I think this movie really shows the spin-off back-plot of the character, explaining to us more about this particular character. And Jonah Hill was also pretty funny, and he has his moments. Both Brand and Hill create a good and hilarious chemistry together, and I couldn't resist. But P-Diddy's performance was about to be ""off-the-roof"" funny, until he starts to get annoying later on. And Nicholas Stoller and Judd Apatow returned to make more laughs, and make them bigger than the laughs I made when watching ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". You know what, they did just that. They just blew the roof off this movie, and made the Aldous Snow character more raunchy and more funny. Now, let me just say, this well-written, raunchy, off-the-roof movie is like watching a sequel to Sarah Marshall, only I would call it: ""Forgetting Aldous Snow"". Now, where was I? Oh, yes! ""Get Him to the Greek"", in my review, ""rocking funny, and a perfect piece of character""."

","Seriously I can see why Jonah Hill and Russell Brand took the paychecks for this movie but it is sorely missing the greatness of Jason Segel's writing. There is not much witty dialogue in this movie at all just Russell Brand being obnoxious which was fine in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but for 2 hours it gets annoying. I only gave it 2 stars because of course there are a few comedies that are far worse but this movie shows that Russell Brand can not carry a movie on his own. I would say Not Another Teen Movie was a better comedy than this movie. That is how far the writing sunk without Segel being involved. Wait for rental."

","I saw the premiere of this movie in Las Vegas at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I was really excited to finally see this movie, especially since it was with the cast. Sadly, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>If you are looking for the Aldous Snow from Forgetting Sarah then forget it. No more ""Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe... like this one. It's like this one's fellow... it's sort of the exact opposite in fact of that - not an evil version but just, you know, a shoe like this"" or ""*after spilling cranberry juice on his shirt* Oh God, please take my eyes, but not the shirt! "". While Brand is funny as Aldous Snow at times, the character just isn't the same. Stoller expanded greatly on him in order for this character to be able to support a full movie, but I think he fell short of accomplishing this successfully and ended up robbing Aldous Snow of what made him so funny in the first place.<br/><br/>Jason Segel wrote Forgetting Sarah Marshall and came up with this character in the first film. Nicholas Stoller, the director of Forgetting, directed and wrote this film without input from Segel and you can tell the difference. Aldous no longer has the funny and stupid lines that made him so memorable. Instead his character entertains by gross out humor and ridiculous actions. Some have warned that this movie is not like Forgetting and I completely agree; but what they haven't said is that Aldous Snow isn't the same character either. Sure, some elements have returned but, as stated above, what made this character great has not.<br/><br/>You'd expect Russel Brand to carry this movie but he actually seems to make the movie drag on. Luckily, Jonah Hill manages to pick up some of the slack and Hill provides almost all of the funniest parts. It's sad that Russel doesn't deliver but I don't blame him for not living up to par, I blame Stoller for taking away what made Aldous Snow so funny in the first place.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but they shouldn't have marketed it as Russell Brand returning as Aldous Snow. I think this is giving people a false idea of what this movie actually is. If you go in expecting Brand to do nothing but flawlessly execute hilarious lines, like from the first movie, then be prepared to be disappointed. If you go in with an open mind and try to forget the Aldous Snow from the first movie then you might actually like it. Sadly, for me I went it wanting to see the Aldous Snow from Forgetting Sarah Marshall and left wishing this film was better."

","The tern 'toilet humor' is often thrown around without a care of how broad it is. Outrageous, tasteless jokes can - and often are - done badly, but when the script pulls no punches, the pacing stays good and the performances are sharp, you can get quite a gem. Forgetting Sarah Marshall did this well with off-kilter jokes and a hint of oddity. But this spin- off takes it well beyond that, adding a level of insanity that elevates it even above the likes of the Hangover. In other words, if you liked that movie, you should watch this. It remains consistently demented, with Russel Brand's Aldous Snow keeping the fires burning while Jonah Hill as the blindsided intern makes the perfect hapless victim. Also worth catching for Puff Daddy as a crazy record mogul and a sequence in Vegas that is just unforgettable."

","Firstly, I love Russell Brand. Secondly, I have seen but pretty much hated My Favorite Year. I thought this was going to be the same thing. It is and then it isn't. It's not as much of a comedy to be honest. And they totally sell it as a comedy, which they do with all Apatow movies and I don't know why. Forgetting Sarah Marshall to me was barely a comedy because it's about a guy who is depressed the whole time. This isn't really that different. Just in this case it's a drug addict rock star who is pretty much headed on the road that many people have taken in recent years and ended up as a breaking news obit at the top of this website. It's another bromance as well, which is fine by me. All these movies are more sentimental than they'd have you believe in the trailers. I personally think that's detrimental to the movie because it makes people expect one thing and get another and then write on the internet how disappointed they are. Problem is, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie about the record industry and people and how they treat each other in such a ridiculous lifestyle with some funny bits thrown in.<br/><br/>I love Russell Brand and Jonah Hill together. I think they have the best chemistry. Their scenes together, pretty much the whole film, were more personal than funny. The more comedic parts usually happen when other people enter the mix. P. Diddy, for example, had a much larger role than I expected and he was okay in it. I probably would have cast an actor with more comedy experience, as well as choosing a different rock star cameo for Jackie Q's other love interest. But apart from that I really have no complaints. Perhaps I would have used more of Aldous' songs throughout the film, but that's because I quite like Brand's voice. I don't know that it was necessary for the plot.<br/><br/>Other stuff. It's an R for a reason. There's sex humor and drug stuff going on. There are some breasts but not much else in the nudity dept. that I can recall. I guess I'd recommend it for people like me who like English rock stars and comedies with warm fuzzies.Evren Buyruk"

","A very funny film starring Russell Brand and Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>Aldous Snow (Brand) was a sober and highly popular rock star. He became concerned by poverty to African children, so went to Africa to try and help the problems with starving children there. He released a single titled 'African Child' and according to critics, it was the worst thing to happen to Africa since the apartheid. So he loses his great reputation, his girlfriend Jackie (Rose Byrne) leaves him so he starts to use drugs and alcohol to the excess. He goes off the radar. However though, head of Pinnacle records Sergio Roma (P Diddy) needs new ideas as his company is in dire straits. One of his employees Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) suggests that his one time hero Aldous Snow should play at the Greek theatre in LA to commemorate a highly famous performance there ten years previously. This could earn a load of money due to the release of a CD, DVD etc. and great commercial interest from sponsors. Sergio agrees to this and Aldous agrees. Aaron is given the task of going to London and taking Aldous to LA and making sure he is ready to perform at the Greek Theatre on the given day. Aaron is also told to agree and do everything Aldous says. Yet with Aldious living this excessive Sex, Drugs, Alcohol and Rock & Roll lifestyle, will Aaron really do everything Aldous tells him and will he get him to the Greek on time...<br/><br/>This is a good film, with some great comic performances. Russell Brand was great as Aldous really living the excessive rock stars lifestyle to the hill and P Diddy was great as Sergio, how I laughed when he has everyone in his household singing 'Daddy's favourite TV show' (even his wife) when his TV show comes on. Yet the greatest performance in it came from Jonas Hill as Aaron. He was the one you had to identify with. He was the man whose own welfare didn't matter and he had to put himself last all the time, being exploited to the limit by Aldous and Pedro. How much exploitation could he handle. Being forced to drink excessively (absinthe) and take drugs (Jeff) was one thing. Being made to smuggle Aldous's drugs out of an airport (heroin) and being raped by a woman in a nightclub at Sergio's request was another thing and what's more being made to have a threesome with his girlfriend Daphne(Elisabeth Moss) and Aldous was a different thing all together. He was excellently exploited.<br/><br/>'Get him to the Greek' is not one of the 'classics'. I have seen better films and I will see better films, yet it succeeds in being very funny and when I say very funny, I mean belly laughs. If you want to be entertained and you want to find yourself laughing, then I strongly recommend this picture."

","Get Him to the Greek (2010): Dir: Nicholas Stoller / Cast: Jonah Hill, Russell Brand, Rose Byrne, Elizabeth Moss, Sean Combs: One of the best comedies of the year, sporting a theme of rock music personas and reality. Jonah Hill plays a talent scout who has three days to get a washed up musician to a concert performance but in doing so, all sorts of things go wrong. Director Nicholas Stoller does a great job at reflecting upon his superb Forgetting Sarah Marshall, with numerous cameos. Russell Brand portrays the same character as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall only he is seen as lonely and drug dependent. As the film opens it is documented that his single ""African Child"" was a failure, and his marriage follows soon afterward. Hill makes a great foil in his drunken mishaps. He is under pressure with his job as well as his relationship but this outing ends up benefiting both he and Brand to great realizations. Elizabeth Moss plays Hill's nurse girlfriend who leaves Hill with the impression that their relationship is over but Brand poses a rather perverse solution. Rose Byrne plays Brand's former lover musician whom he regrets cutting ties with. She steals every scene she is in with her drunken behaviour. She will end up involved with another musician although she will clarify certain facts upon their next encounter. Sean Combs is hilarious as a conniving record company owner out to control Brand and cause Hill paranoia. Great comedy demonstrates the pressure of fame and the struggle to be real. The result is a comedy that will leave you laughing at the absurdity of it all. Score: 10 / 10"

","Something I really liked about this movie, was fact that it was a kind of sequel, kind of spin off to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Our main character, Aldous Snow, was a main character in that movie. We also see, really quickly, another little hint to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. We see Sarah Marshall on TV. Aldous and Sarah had previously dated. You don't need to see Forgetting Sarah Marshall before you watch this, but I do recommend it. Not just because it will help with one tiny piece of the movie, but because it's a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>I love Jonah Hill in this. He is so outrageously funny in it and he just makes me laugh so much. Russell Brand is also a very talented and funny actor in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is about getting a man, Adous Snow, to the Greek. Hence the title, Get Him To The Greek. The Greek is actually The Greek Theater in Los Angeles, where Aldous is to perform a concert to get people talking about him again. One man, Aaron Green, is sent to pick Aldous up from London, and get him there. We see a lot of stuff happen in this movie. Including, but not limited to, drugs, sex, random stuff, funny stuff, etc. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"dmanyc","2","6","15","27 May 2011"," Should've smoked a Jeffrey instead of watching this.
","Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is a rock 'n' roll icon that looks like the spawn of Mick Jagger and Amy Winehouse. He's on a downward spiral professionally (African Child) and personally (break-up with pop star Jackie Q, who I didn't realize till afterward was the chick from Damages) and his one chance of a comeback is a reunion concert with his old group Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater. Aaron (Jonah Hill) is an intern at Pinnacle Records with low self esteem, a girlfriend who spends more time working at the hospital than with him, and a boss Sergio (Sean Combs a.k.a. Puffy, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy) with the assignment of a lifetime: get Aldous Snow, who's also Aaron's idol, to the Greek Theater in 72 hours with a stop on the Today show along the way. Sounds simple, right? Not really. Aldous downs drugs and alcohol, has sex with numerous women, and encourages Aaron to get in on the fun. Aaron, who's on the outs with said girlfriend and desperate to get respect at Pinnacle, tries to do his job but succumbs to Aldous' lifestyle. All this is suppose to be funny, but it's not.<br/><br/>One of the problems is the acting. Brand is funny...in small doses. In FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (where Aldous originated), he's a scene stealer. In GET HIM TO THE Greek, he wears out his welcome about a half hour into the film. Hill is better as a smart-ass like in KNOCKED UP and SUPERBAD than a people-pleasing mope. Combs playing an exaggerated version of himself gets old pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Second was the vomiting, the quasi-rape between Aaron and some broad in Vegas, the almost threesome with Aldous, Aaron, and Aaron's girlfriend, sticking heroin balloons in bodily functions not meant to hide anything much less drugs, etc. It just came across as been-there-seen-it-too-many-times-in-other-funnier-films. Even the famous cameos can't save this.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a funny film about people doing bad things, just rent THE HANGOVER. If you get the urge to see GET HIM TO THE Greek, just stoke a furry wall."

I gotta admit without these scenes, the film will likely to take up 30 mins screen time. The story is just that simple. I don't know, the crazy-stuffs works for me most of the time, but in this movie I felt like it was a bit overused, an excuse to patch it up to 2 hrs running time. I guess I got a bit tired of the Aldous thing going on. Not like other comedies I've watched when there's a hilly-billy threesome (Harold and Kumar), stupid-crazy Cops (Superbad), or a Vegas-fuckup scene (Knocked Up). Then only crazy scene that made me laugh was the one regarding the furry wall. That aside there's just Aldous on crack."

","To start, I didn't want to see this movie, but some friends dragged me to it. It was lude, it was crude; everything you would expect from Russell Brand.<br/><br/>The characters weren't very realistic at all- Aaron downing a flask of whiskey so that Aldus couldn't drink it (instead of dumping it out), Aaron's girlfriend not breaking up with him after hearing him have sex while butt dialing her, and then her decision in the super awkward last scene. It also bugged me that Jonah was not reprising his role from Sarah Marshall, but Russell was- not a huge distraction, but I thought it lazy.<br/><br/>Some of the funnier lines came from P. Diddy, but it was all script and had nothing to do with his acting; he's terrible. Rose Byrne also gave a weak performance, and her character's songs didn't even toy with innuendo, they were 100% genuine filth. The songs were perhaps the grossest bits of dialogue in the film.<br/><br/>The timing of some of the scenarios is also really, really off. More than once we're told that they have ""less than an hour to get to the airport"" while stuck in traffic. In the three hours before his show we're shown Aldus visiting Jackie and having sex with her, Aldus visiting Aaron and trying to threesome with him and his girlfriend, and Aldus finding an exclusive party and getting wasted where he falls in a pool and learns his lesson.<br/><br/>One redeeming quality of the movie is Brand, who is just an awkward accident waiting to happen, you can't stop watching him. The other is the not-so-subtle addiction and loneliness theme personified in Aldus, it gave the film some context and a little bit of heart amidst all the ludity."

","While there is no doubt that the comedy in this film stretches through different layers it also captures the visual dangers of narcotics. If anyone has been in that situation before I'm sure it will seem familiar. It cannot compare to the likes of ""Trainspotting"" or ""Hot tub Time Machine"", it seems to lie between the two.<br/><br/>Personally I didn't think a film, of this genre, could be serious and funny at the same time, yet it captures the realism of the care free lifestyle whilst entertaining you in only a way Russell Brand could, who is a seriously under rated actor, but ""PD"" lends this movie most of the laughs, which I thought surprising.<br/><br/>Cringe moments, but definitely worth a watch."

","Disappointing. Started off incredibly well - screamingly funny, and a good parody of the music industry. Then about halfway through, it just suddenly hit a wall, running out of ideas, and anything funny to say.<br/><br/>If the music industry parody could have been maintained at the same level of intensity and humour as in the first half, this would have been a great movie. The edginess just seemed to disappear after a while, plus the writer and director seemed to think the movie was a drama, delving into some rather half-baked takes on relationships.<br/><br/>Russell Brand is great in the lead role, playing a character that was tailor-made for his rock star-like personality and appearance. Jonah Hill is weak and irritating as the sidekick. The surprise performance comes from Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs as the intense record exec. He is amazingly good, and almost steals the show from Russell Brand.<br/><br/>Watch the first 40 minutes or so, and save yourself some time by skipping the rest."

","Russell Brand was quite amusing in Forgetting Sarah Marshall playing a pretentious yet rather likable rock star.

Here we have a nebbish who gets to lead the life of a rock star, but this is not portrayed as a good thing, making it more of a be-careful-what-you-wish for theme.<br/><br/>Brand is very funny in this film (and in the end proves he'd make a pretty good rock star), but it is Sean Combs who supplies the biggest laughs with a take-no-prisoners performance as a music studio head.<br/><br/>Brand's peculiar charisma and the movie's frenetic pace work well, and over all I enjoyed this movie a bit more than Forgetting Sarah Marshall."

"MaxBorg89","7","3","6","6 February 2011"," The Russell Brand Show
","Although the lead role was ostensibly played by Jason Segel, many reckon (and justifiably so) that Forgetting Sarah Marshall really belonged to Russell Brand, whose deranged - and, to some degree, autobiographical - performance as a womanizing, junkie pop star was a consistent laugh magnet. Not a big surprise, then, to find out that the character received his own movie, albeit described in official circles as a ""semi-sequel"" instead of a ""spin-off"" to avoid comparisons with previous, failed attempts to flesh out minor characters from popular films. Well, one thing is certain: for all its flaws (and there are a few), Get Him to the Greek is no Evan Almighty.<br/><br/>Aside from Brand reprising his role as Aldous Snow, the only other on-screen link with Sarah Marshall, not counting a brief but fun cameo by Kristen Bell, is Jonah Hill, playing a different character this time. Gone is Matthew, the hotel employee with a weird fixation for Aldous; welcome Aaron, a California record company employee with a weird fixation for Aldous. In fact, he suggests that, in order to boost the company's success, they bring the British singer from London to L.A. for a big comeback concert. His boss Sergio (P. Diddy) agrees, on one condition: Aaron himself has less than three days to get Snow across the Atlantic. This proves to be more difficult than anticipated, as Aldous is off the wagon, pining over former flame Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) and generally prone to behavior that could wreck the whole operation. To quote Bette Davis, ""It's gonna be a bumpy ride"".<br/><br/>With no aid from Segel (who participated merely as a songwriter), returning director Nicholas Stoller is on scripting duty as well, and retains the first film's showbiz satire angle. While that got a bit out of hand last time, a tighter focus (solely the music industry) allows for greater, more genuine laughs: as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Aldous' outrageous lyrics are a hoot, and the presence of all the genre clichÃ©s - sex, drugs, booze, family issues, slutty girlfriends, et al - feels less trite and predictable than usual. Then again, not many movies begin with the ""hero"" proudly proclaiming himself ""the African Jesus"".<br/><br/>On the flip-side, the rom-com material isn't equally strong, the main ""arc"" - Aaron's strained relationship with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Moss) - being a rather conventional and tired plot device that fails to convince throughout, climaxing in a cringe-worthy Chasing Amy spoof that wouldn't be bad if the storyline had been developed more carefully. A shame, because Moss, who proved to be the best thing in the dull Did You Hear about the Morgans?, shows once again that she has comedic skills to be reckoned with. The rest of the cast is just as reliable: the spotlight is inevitably on Brand, but the real standouts are P. Diddy's hilariously foulmouthed manager and Rose Byrne's spot-on ""troubled"" British singer, showing off a knack for comedy never even hinted at in her previous roles (well, 28 Weeks Later... is hardly laughing matter).<br/><br/>All in all, perfectly acceptable Apatow stuff: inconsistent but solid laughs, a game cast, terrific soundtrack and some neat movie references. Hardly a genre classic, but the Kubrick joke alone makes it worthwhile."

","""Get Him to the Greek"" had me cracking up within the first two minutes of the opening scene. I am not Russell Brands biggest fan, but I have to admit his portrayal as Aldous Snow, the totally drugged out alcoholic rock star was spot on and comical. Jonah Hill played the awkward, but lovable Aaron Green great as well. I was also really surprised how well P. Diddy did acting in this film.<br/><br/>This movie is full of stupid laughs, but stupid laughs are my favorite. It reminds me a lot of Superbad; the plot really isn't all that amusing but the one-liners and the actor's delivery definitely bring the laughs.<br/><br/>""Get Him to the Greek"" is definitely a movie I would put in and watch to de-stress and get a few good laughs out of after a bad day. It is one of the first movies that had me almost in the floor laughing in the theater in a very long time."
"spacechick2003","8","3","6","18 January 2011"," Quite a surprise!
","There have no doubt been loads of reviews written on this board already on this title, so I will keep this brief, not go over the plot (as there are plenty of others with the time and patience to do that) and just give my honest opinion on first viewing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, it was hilariously funny in parts, quite touching in others and there was a message contained in the film if you cared to look. That message being, in my opinion, that celebrity can be over-rated, but who honestly can say, hand on heart, that they aren't even slightly jealous of the celebrity life-style? Certainly not me. Oh the other message would be, do what makes you happiest.<br/><br/>That slight digression aside, a quick word about the cast. I was pretty amazed at how good an actor and singer Russell Brand is, even though I am a fan of the guy. Still wasn't expecting him to be such a good actor. Alright, basically I just think it is Russell playing himself if he was a rock star instead of a highly famous comedian/actor/writer etc. Still he was very good in it as was the guy who played his 'minder' for 3 days, sorry don't know the actors name, but they played off each other brilliantly, especially in the threesome scene.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me was probably what the biggest surprise was for everyone else, that Sean Combs was so funny as well. Well done to him and really everyone in the cast for the funniest couple of hours I've spent in a while. (Oh and his wife in the movie, Jackie Q, doing her videos, so like Katy Perry as well).<br/><br/>Think the cast must have had a blast doing this and it shows through to the movie.<br/><br/>Really good movie, didn't over-analyise it as you can see. I'm just saying it see for a good laugh and some surprising turns from people you somehow expect to be more serious. Had a great time watching it! Don't trust the reviews who say this film is not funny, they must have a sense of humour by-pass. Now pass me a Jeffrey and if I can't handle anything in my life now I only need to think of Furry, furry carpets!"
"Chase_Witherspoon","2","6","16","27 May 2012"," Bangers and mash, this is trash
","This film is an absolute abomination. I watched it about 18 months ago and my feelings haven't yet mellowed. Brand plays a drug-addled bad-boy rock star thrown a lifeline by Combs who agrees to promote his tour, but only if the comparatively conservative Hill (whose idea it was to resurrect Brand's career) can successfully bring him half way round the world to close the deal. In my opinion, it's not necessarily the story that's mundane or just plain useless, but the miscasting.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill isn't nearly ""mature"" looking enough to pull-off his world-weary music industry marketing exec, a man-child whose apparent knowledge and appreciation of grass roots rock belies his meagre age. He displays a resigned grief at the commercialisation of rock'n'roll, but it's the dialogue of an older actor, and Hill just doesn't look convincing. Even his live-in girlfriend, a medical intern (Moss) looks old enough to be his aunt (or his mother perhaps but I don't want to go there). Some reviewers have lauded Sean Combs' foul-mouthed music promoter as deft casting, but in my opinion, he comes off looking self-indulgent. As for Russell's brand, his celebrity status is so inescapable that any attempt at playing a ""character"" (arguable as to whether he's more or less playing himself here) fails miserably.<br/><br/>The lyrics to Brand's satirical songs could have been a coup, but they too are gratuitous and self-aware. More subtlety and less canned laughter was sorely needed to float this boat, and in the end, it, like its drug-fuelled fictitious star, drowns spectacularly in its own slick puddle of sick."

But he really didn't' add anything to the proceedings.. and as the film moves along. it feels more like MOMENTS that work well enough on their own.. but as en entire film, it never really ties together.<br/><br/>And as you clip along into the third act.. Snow finds his ""rock and roll life"" empty.. And what was with putting Rose Byrne in the movie? She had some funny lines.. but yet again, didn't add too much to the film over all. If anything.. the relationship between Aldous and his ""son"" is what should have been explored.. sadly the same with his father (while some funny moments... nothing really felt resolved, as you'd think.<br/><br/>But. that's the REAL problem here. with Aldous being the CRAZY and loopy rock star.. part of what worked in his earlier role.. is that everyone around him was kind of normal. and you even identified with SOME of the characters. You don't here really.. and the movie jumps from being ""guy being smacked in the face/head"" to this.. kind of slightly serious third act.<br/><br/>Sean Combs? I have nothing against him or his music (not my taste). But it seemed like they thought the foul mouthed Tom Cruise character from ""Tropic Thunder"" was a good idea.. but let's let P. Diddy drop the bombs. he really has no impact as a character.. and he has no real presence in the film as a whole either.<br/><br/>The movie had.. at the first minute a confusing opening.. but then again.. it makes sense giving the ""music video"" in Marshall.. But..<br/><br/>I don't hate the film totally.. there were a few laughs.. Carla Gallo shows up as a stripped named Destiny.. is a real stand out BIT for the film.. in the whole over the top level as they go. but.. it never felt they were poking FUN at the rock star life, as you'd hope.. and they never really make much of a notice of how miserable, really, that it makes Aldous to have to live it..<br/><br/>This is by far to me the WEAKEST Apatow entry.. It scores just below ""Funny Peope"" (can't comment on ""Drillbit Taylor"".. so I won't). Unlike ""Funny People"" which may not have been GREAT.. it did tie together quite well.<br/><br/>This is a real disappointment on ALL levels.. from the director, Stoeller who did a great job with Marshall just felt FLAT and confined here.. the casting was OK.. but the characters were so transparently THIN and really unlikable or unrelatable (Adam Green and his girlfriend being the two worst in this area).<br/><br/>There are some THEMES that.. it would have been GREAT to explore.. the whole idea of Aldous finding his LOVE of performing again.. deciding the rock star life wasn't for him.. or the fact that record managers are A lot of the problem telling people what they WANT to hear.. rather than what they NEED to hear.. all great things that MIGHT have given.. something to this film..<br/><br/>but, as I said.. there are IDEAS thrown out there.. and I did like the BRIEF callback to Sarah Marshall.. it tied the worlds together. But over all.. its not a film that's either fall out funny.. and not a film you can identify with the characters (I couldn't anyway). So it fell as a rather sharp disappointment. I was quite looking forward to it. The character had such great potential, and the idea of a film pointing out the flaws and foibles behind the music industry could have been GREAT fodder for the film. As it stands the episode of South Park about illegal downloads really does have more depth than this film. unfortunate."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","13","18 March 2011"," Forgetting Aldous Snow
","Russell Brand reprises his role as Aldous Snow in this spin off of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. The film starts off hilariously summarizing the rise and fall of rockstar Aldous Snow mocking many celebrity couples. Once Jonah Hill's Aaron Green makes his entry, the story shifts on Green getting Snow ready for a comeback concert and their pukish and sometimes funny adventure together. I would say that this film is somewhat better than the usual non-funny comedy that comes out of the Apatow factory. Expectedly, there's plenty of repetitive toilet humour and that does get annoying but most of the other tongue-in-cheek commercial works well. The pacing is sluggish at times and the movie feels very long. Russell Brand is great as the washed out rockstar. Jonah Hill is a lot less annoying than he usually is. Rose Byrne is terrific. P.Diddy Combs is wooden. Obviously, 'Get Him to the Greek' is not to be taken too seriously. It's easily forgettable but it did make me laugh a couple of times."

"zetes","6","5","13","6 June 2010"," A slight disappointment for a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","A movie spin-off of Nicholas Stoller's previous film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That was one of my favorite comedies of the year in 2008. In fact, I include it fairly high on my top 10 list of that year in general. And Aldous Snow (played by British comedian Russell Brand) was part of the reason for that movie's success, for sure. So, alas, Snow's spin-off movie is unfortunately a mild disappointment. Jonah Hill (who had a small role in Sarah Marshall but plays a different character in this) works for a record company. He has an idea to re-ignite the fading rock star's career by having him perform a ten year anniversary gig at the site of one of his biggest triumphs. But, of course, Snow is a pampered rock star who likes to party constantly and do whatever the Hell he wants, and Hill is kind of a pushover. It's a simple story, and one that has been done before. All you have to do is string some good jokes along and it should work. It does work much of the time, in all honesty. It even has some good characters. I especially love Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) as Hill's overworked girlfriend. And P. Diddy is actually really funny as Hill's boss. Colm Meaney (whom I always remember from Star Trek: The Next Generation) is also good as Snow's father. The film is sporadically funny - hilarious at times, even. But for some reason it always feels like it's kind of shallow and just not funny enough. Forgetting Sarah Marshall really scored by having just enough real emotion in the film that we ended up caring for the characters. I don't think this one ever gets that far, though it does try. Maybe Sarah Marshall's screenwriter (and star) Jason Segel should have collaborated on the script with Stoller. This film is still well worth a rental if you liked the first film. Kristen Bell has a nice cameo as Sarah Marshall in the film."

"brando647","9","4","10","3 November 2010"," Aldous Snow Gets His Own Movie!
","I had commented on FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, stating that Russell Brand's self-focused rock star Aldous Snow was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. Apparently, I wasn't alone and writer-director Nicholas Stoller has returned to give the lead singer of fictional rock band Infant Sorrow his own movie. As the film begins, Aldous has fallen back into a life of stoned/drunken debauchery as his music career hits rock bottom with his universally hated album ""African Child"" and his love life sits in shambles with his long-time lover model/pop star Jackie Q splits with their son. In Los Angeles, Aaron Green is an up-and-comer with Pinnacle Records and suggests to his boss that they hold a ten year anniversary concert with Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater. Aaron is given the job of flying out to London, wrangling Aldous, and ensuring that he gets him to Los Angeles in three days for his performance.<br/><br/>I was worried when I saw the original trailers for this film. The jokes weren't coming off well and I began to fear a movie I'd been looking forward to was going to fall flat. I was so glad when I finally got to the theater and saw the film because it is HILARIOUS. Russell Brand as Snow is one of the funniest characters in recent years and he completely embodies his role (probably because some aspects are loosely pulled form his own personal life). Surprisingly, he even manages to give his character some depth and earn sympathy as the film progresses when it becomes apparent he's not a one-note joke but begins to show a bit of humanity. Jonah Hill, while usually a scene stealer in his own regard, is constantly over-shadowed by Brand's bravado. His character was written as a passive person, which sealed the deal of playing second fiddle when you put him with Brand's stoned energy.<br/><br/>There are some great cameos in the film. Colm Meaney shifts gears for a comedic turn as Aldous's father, Jonathan, and he's got great chemistry with Brand. The entire sequence in which Aldous detours to Vegas for a visit with his estranged father is the funniest in the film, beginning with an awkward conversation and ending in a full-blown rock star hotel room trashing. Even Sean Combs is hilarious in the film as Sergio, head of Pinnacle and Aaron's boss. He fell right into the improve/comedy vibe and I wouldn't mind seeing Combs making further appearances in Apatow-produced comedies.<br/><br/>Major credit needs to be given to Jason Segel, Lyle Workman, Mike Viola, and the rest who wrote original music for Infant Sorrow and Jackie Q. Seriously, the music in the film is good enough that I had to get the soundtrack. Each of the songs sounds as if it could be a legitimate rock/pop song and each of them is hilarious and often addicting. After having seen this film a few times and gotten the tunes stuck in my head, I really wish Infant Sorrow was a real band."

And while Get Him to the Greek isn't bad by any means, I don't think it lived up to either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or it's own potential.<br/><br/>Russell Brand and Jonah Hill are funny guys, so it may come as a surprise that the two funniest people in the movie were Rose Byrne and Sean Combs. They were both hilarious. Brand's character seems to be more reigned in this time around, and doesn't get to be nearly as funny as he was in the previous movie, where he stole the show. The great (and hilarious) songs from FSM were also replaced with some that weren't nearly as funny or clever. Hill gets some funny moments, but the stuff with his girlfriend (the awesome Elisabeth Moss in a small role) just never came off as particularly interesting or genuine. I get that the filmmakers were going for that mix of humor and relationship stuff that made FSM have such a wide appeal, but that's a tricky thing to pull off and the formula doesn't work as well, here.<br/><br/>I'm sure my review seems harsh, and I don't mean it to be that way. Get Him to the Greek is a decent comedy. Some parts were quite funny. But to be honest, as the movie went along the jokes began to fizzle out until I was almost bored for the last 15 minutes. Check it out, but I doubt you'll be in a hurry to see it again soon."
"stang-creativitree","9","4","10","13 July 2010"," Greek - love this movie
","In a sense this is a typical Apatow movie, comedy, humor, and heart. The movie is so much more than the trailers suggest. Some people apparently are put off by that; while I, on other hand, found it a great rock and roll story, a look behind the industry, and a feel good movie at the end. The two main characters slowly help each other to sort out their respective lives. I thought it felt similar to a documentary about a favorite rock star; and ultimately a feel good movie. I liked the flow; and I especially liked the music and also the dramatic side to this movie. If you are expecting gross out humor for the entire movie, you will be disappointed. However, if you want a great story, acting, and incredible music, go for it."

","Get Him to the Greek is an excellent comedy, largely due to the hilarious performances by Jonah Hill and Russel Brand, and P. Diddy in a standout performance, but mostly because of the fact that it just doesn't give a damn.<br/><br/>What I mean is that it shows scenes of excess that are so wacky, outlandish, and sometimes impossible that writer/director Nicholas Stoller has to know that they're wacky, outlandish, and sometimes impossible. But he also knows that they're very funny.<br/><br/>I also found it nice to see Jonah Hill in a role that is a bit different from the sarcastic nerd that he usually plays, and he does a good job of playing the role of the uptight, nervous, well-meaning nerd. I was also very surprised at how funny P. Diddy was. I was expecting his role to be just a cameo, but it was actually a great comedic performance that nearly steals the show. But Russel Brand is the real star of this movie. Every scene he's in is funny.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of ""sophisticated comedy"" or you aren't a big fan of producer Judd Apatow's other comedies, you will probably dislike Get Him to the Greek. But if you want to have a fun time at the movies and don't have problem with suspension of disbelief and being politically incorrect, I believe you'll love Get Him to the Greek."

","Get Him To The Greek, is hilarious. I laughed my *** off throughout the entire movie. Even during parts of the film that weren't even that funny.<br/><br/>This film is funny, but, when compared to other comedy's such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hang Over, Or Supberbad, it is not that funny. However, it was funny enough to keep me laughing, and entertained from start to finish.<br/><br/>If you go to see this movie, and you take it too seriously, you will not enjoy it. Because, some of the humor may not be found to be humorous to everyone that see this. As much as I enjoyed this movie, I would not recommend it to someone that is looking to see a masterpiece plot. Because even though I found it be very humorous,the film does have a little bit of a dull in plot. With that typed. If you watch it without taking it too seriously, you should laugh out out like no tomorrow.<br/><br/>Also, despite Russell Brand not being such as great actor, he actually did a pretty good job in this film, and did a great job with his charictor, and the comedy itself.<br/><br/>To sum this all up, I would just simple state that it is a great, entertaining, and interesting film."

It is one of the most offensive films of all time and one of the worse. Get Him To The Greek's leads Hill and Brand cannot save this movie from a atrocious script and direction. The film is about the comeback of a singer as a guy at a music company tries to get him to America but stuff happens along the way and its just awful. I don't think awful is even a word to describe this movie. Its... I don't know. This film has some of the most offensive stuff in a movie ever. It starts with a music video about Starving African children and blow jobs. How appropriate. There is much more awfulness but I haven't seen it since.

","This movie likes to rely on a used perverted mind to preserve its stale overrated comedy. I watched this movie and only enjoyed the parts where any sense of the real world was available. When our friend Aaron is trying to get Albous, the rock star, anywhere he just falls on weak knees getting drunk and having sex. No sense of character development was shown or even tried for. I had to keep myself from leaving halfway through this garbage. If I was to describe this movie in one word I would say pornography. Not once was the main character able to stand firm with any decisions; he was always getting pushed around by others. Also, it seems that everywhere they go they have sex. I saw nothing funny after watching sex for the fifteenth time. Don't watch this."

But big mistake!<br/><br/>Very slow-paced, not many comical moments, verbal or otherwise, ruins this film quite a lot since it's one of those movies that has great potential if only the director and script writer to name a few had made some real effort in the making and not just rushing it.<br/><br/>Russel Brand on the other hand is the one guy here that's actually funny for one times sake so it's not all bad, but not far from it sadly.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to stay away from this movie if you expect a comedy with lots of laughs, cause that this is not."

","I liked the idea. I liked the character from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" I fully anticipated, and wanted, a hilarious gross-out farce. Sadly, someone forgot to include the laughs, as they tried to get us to care about these characters. The opening was funny, depicting rocker Aldous Snow's pretentious fall, but the laughs soon dried up. This film reminded me of the flawed and ill- structured ""Funny People."" Both films desperately wanted to you laugh and care about the characters. Both films failed. ""Funny People"" was the better of the two. It had the head start of a better script and better acting. (But, come on, who really wants to see Adam Sandler in another dramatic turn?) A disappointment."

","I watched Forgetting Sarah Marshall just before Get Him To The Greek came out of the cinema. I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I thought instantly .. I REALLY want to see the squeal as it looked good. <br/><br/>The plot is about a guy called Aaron Green (Jonah Hill)who works in a record company which is stuck in a recession. Aaron's boss gives him a career making task - to bring English rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)from London to L.A. for a concert in 72 hours. Then, it becomes a roller-coaster ride from London to Los Angeles. <br/><br/>First of all, I am a massive fan of Russell Brand and I thought he was great playing Aldous. But I do think that this film is not a reactment but shows his story about Russell's past. You will get me on this if you live in the UK. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill also did a good performance playing Aaron.<br/><br/>They were scenes that we LOL funny. Especially the scene where Aaron has an heart attack and Aldous tells him to 'stroke the furry wall', oh god that did made me giggle. <br/><br/>This film is better than Forgetting Sarah Marshall as Get Him To The Greek is mainly directed at Aldous at what happens to him as well as Aaron. <br/><br/>Get Him To The Greek will not disappoint if you like outrageous comedies.<br/><br/>Get Him To The Greek gets a 7/10 from me. :)"

","""Get Him to the Greek"" was one of the funnier movies to come out in 2010. Within a few minutes of the movie starting it had me dying in laughter. The movie is based on an insane rock star Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brands, that just does what ever he wants and does not have a care in the world for anyone but him self. Between doing tons of drugs, drinking, and parting it is just one big spiral out of control. That is until actor Jonah Hill, who is Aaron Green a nerdy very good hearted person steps into Aldous Snows life. This movie is full of laughs the entire time and is recommended to any one that just needs to laugh a little bit or are just trying to watch an hilarious movie."

Comedies like Killers, Sex and the City 2, Cop Out, and Furry Vengeance all bombed in the box office and critics hated them. Although Get Him to the Greek is raunchy and full of sex jokes, it still got me laughing my ass off. I enjoyed this very much and writing a long review for a comedy like this isn't my style.

","In the soft chewy center of every Apatow movie there is a heartwarming message and that somehow has always flowed naturally with the movie no matter how raunchy.In Get Him to the Greek it didn't workout so well, it was kinda forced.Also,this movie never felt like it had a real lead. The movie is a spin-off of a supporting character from the movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" which in like every Apatow movie the supporting characters are the funniest parts, so what could go wrong when you make a movie from the funniest parts of an Apatow movie.The message get forced in at the last minute because the story isn't making any progress because jokes are being told every 5 seconds its not a bad thing but it kills the buzz at the last 15 mins and slows down this really fast paced movie.The movie starts funny and it just gets crazier and more raunchy as it goes but the message slows it down and it feels out of place plus this brought memories from Walk Hard the other musician Apatow movie which in the directors cut has 35 minutes in the comeback phase of the artist.It feels like Apatow liked that so much that he picked his other character that sings and made a movie out of it. Walk hard is a more quotable movie but Get him to the Greek is better but unlike Walk Hard its dated thanks too way to many pop culture references and cameos which was the bad thing with Funny People way to many cameos there are all funny but not all of them are necessary.The movie is really funny.Russell Brand is insane,Jonah Hill is funny but he has done better.Diddy steals every scene he is in but what made this movie is the insane amount of not giving a crap that Russell Brand brings he is the Rock Star of comedy and the f'd up moments are really f'd up even for Apatow,the dildo scene was hilarious.<br/><br/>Too sum up.The movie is really enjoyable and hilarious.The heartwarming moment was out of place but well executed to a certain degree.Russell Brand is top-notch.And I know I mentioned Apatow names a bunch of times but this is really Director Nicholas Stollers movie.<br/><br/>8/10 It's a really funny movie but it wont be as memorable as other Apatow produced or directed films Rent it"

","Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is a rock star who has come under public criticism for his tasteless song African Child. Following this critical panning, Aldous breaks up with his long term partner Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), even though they have a son, and after being sober for several years he resumes drinking again. Meanwhile, Pinnacle Records boss Sergio Roma (Sean Combs) calls a crisis meeting with his staff, hoping to spark ideas for his music company. Intern Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) comes up with the idea of holding a special anniversary concert for one of Aldou's famous performances. Sergio is initially reluctant but with little choice he tasks Aaron with bringing Aldous from the UK to the Greek Theatre in the USA. Just before he leaves, Aaron has a row with his girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss), who is working as a nurse and wants to move to Seattle. Believing that he has broken up with her, Aaron has a slightly more free rein as Aldous takes him through his crazy rock star lifestyle.<br/><br/>It is with a certain degree of irony that toilet humour has long been a staple of adult comedies. Sex gags and bodily functions are favourable in American comedies because they allow people to experience the most cringing situations without the embarrassing memories or incriminating Facebook photos. Judd Apatow is a director who has deliberately set out to throwback to the 80s style frat boy gross-out comedies for adults. His production company has been responsible for films such as Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and now Get Him to the Greek. This film has Apatow's stamp on it but it was written and directed by Nicholas Stoller who brings back two of the same characters from Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The result is one of the funniest films so far this year, no matter how lowbrow it may seem. The film is tailored for audiences who enjoy the gross-out brand of humour as there are copious scenes involving anal humour, vomiting and drunkenness. Some may compare it to The Hangover (2009) but given the way that it parodies and mocks the music industry, it probably has more in common with Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008.), drawing broad strokes about the self-indulgent nature of washed-up celebrities in a cutthroat industry. The plot here is indeed thin and exists largely to host a series of extremely funny skits of Aldous embarrassing Aaron, like getting him to smuggle drugs in his anus through the airport. Yet the tone remains light, never nasty and the cringing nature of these situations and some of the tension too, ensures that the laughs are frequent.<br/><br/>Although Russell Brand is a popular comedian it is pleasing that the script is brimming with hilarious dialogue that allows him to share a lot of the laughs with Jonah Hill. Hill's timing, expressions and his ability to look completely helpless when his girlfriend, Aldous or Sergio are standing over him, makes Aaron an incredibly funny but also endearing character. Both actors give really funny and silly performances but its Hill that practically steals the movie. Surprisingly, there are some efforts to round out the characters beyond a level of caricature in the form of their relationships, in a manner which is not entirely superfluous. There are loose women who follow Aldous everywhere but he also has his partner who holds a revelation about their son and Aaron also has a rather sweet relationship with Daphne, which brings some humanity amidst the craziness of the rock star lifestyle. One of the biggest surprises held by the film though is the hysterical, self-deprecating performance from Sean Combs, whose character shares the same vein of insanity as Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder. His crazy theories about mind controlling and the life expectancy of British rock stars are just some of his very best moments. This unlikely performance actually begs whether Sean Comb's embarrassing fragrance commercial ""I Am King"" was a joke on himself and everyone else for believing he was serious.<br/><br/>Get him To the Greek is an adult comedy with a lot of juvenile and silly gags but this is still one of the funniest films one of the year because of the frequently hilarious dialogue and the performances of the cast who know how to play their roles straight. Those who are willing to tolerate this brand of humour will find this to be a most enjoyable comedy and the end will resonate with them because of its rather sweet message, speaking about personal potential, leaving it as a warm and funny film, no matter how crude it may appear on the surface."

","The main problem is the main character, he's just not funny at all. I had seen him in other movies as a random sideshow and sometimes he's slightly funny in those cases but still more corny than anything.<br/><br/>Oddly enough Kanye West or P diddy or whoever that was did provide some laughs. I can't tell them apart because they both do the same dumb things to try and act cool (like wearing sunglasses indoors at night). But he was funny and did a good job acting hypertensive and crazy.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is normally a really funny guy when given the right role, but in this case he has to try to make something off his interactions with the main character which is hard to do when Russel Brand just brings nothing to the movie for him to work with. It wasn't a good role for Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>The movie does have quite a few cameos that I guess they hoped would engage the viewers more, but I was so annoyed and disappointed by the lack of comedy that I just didn't care."

","Get Him to the Greek shows us what can happen when a regular guy gets the chance to party like a rock star. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill), a seemingly nobody record executive get his once in a lifetime chance as he is chosen to escort failing rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his comeback show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles after a few scheduled appearances along the way. Of course Aldous is less concerned about schedules and more about partying, which provides conflict as Aaron's boss, Sergio Roma (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs), is constantly tracking his every move.<br/><br/>Get Him to the Greek is like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles on drugs. Though it may be too soon to compare Jonah Hill and Russell Brand to the likes of Steve Martin and John Candy, these two definitely displayed a comedic chemistry. Similar to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Aaron and Aldous are two strangers on a journey that find trouble, and friendship, along the way. That is where the similarity ends. In their time, Martin and Candy would not have gotten away with some of the outrageous scenes found in this movie. These days, given what we can see daily on cable television, it would seem almost impossible for a movie to provide original, ""gross out"" comedy without being rated NC-17, but Get Him to the Greek pulls it off, with a bonus.<br/><br/>My expectations of this movie were pretty low. I hadn't seen the trailers but have always enjoyed watching Jonah Hill and was excited to see him have a larger role in this movie. However, I assumed the film would be another unrealistic, gross comedy and nothing more. To my surprise, with the exception of some exaggerated scenes, the characters seemed to make the film believable, which served to enhance an already very funny film.<br/><br/>The main focus of the film was on the characters, Aaron and Aldous, two men on opposite ends of the lifestyle spectrum. Aaron is the everyday, regular guy trying to lead a normal life, and Aldous, the famous rock star for whom everyday is a party. The settings in the movie really accentuate the lives of each; for Aaron, the ordinary apartment building and office job, and for Aldous, seemingly every five star hotel and night club from London to Los Angeles. All in all, if you like outrageous comedies, Get Him to the Greek will not disappoint. I felt as though I got my money's worth and then some."

1. Jonah Hills character has a different name than what his characters name was In Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Yet he's supposed to be playing the same character?
2. His job in Forgetting Sarah Marshall was at the hotel in Hawaii yet now he's working for some label? And not in Hawaii?
3. Random actors that were in Forgetting Sarah Marshall are in this but are not playing their original characters?<br/><br/>If you're going to make a spin-off at the very least, have the lead actor be playing his character from the original movie. Not some made up new name, new job, new location - no correlation to the first movie at all character play the lead. You might as well just make a stand-alone movie instead of a ""spin-off"". Just because two of the same actors are in it doesn't make it a spin-off.

The plot I thought was good. Thought it went a bit downhill after the hour mark and the ending was just a bit meh. Wasn't a bad ending or anything it was just a bit dull.
A solid part of the story was based on the relationship between Jonah's character and his girlfriend. And to be honest it just never sucked me in.

I saw the uncut version, so not sure of how much of the music video is in the regular cut. But let's just say yo can't be squeamish or on a political correctness path - this will not sit well with you. If you dislike Brand himself ... well that doesn't help either. I know some people who find him annoying and his role here does not help liking him more.<br/><br/>I'm not saying he's playing himself (hey, that's not what I meant, though there are quite a few innuendos in this one, so who knows?), but for some what is portrayed here, is how they perceive him in actual life.

We are sure all the amazing people that worked on the project had their best intentions for giving the viewer a good time at the movies. The comedy is not exactly inspired and at times it falls flat.<br/><br/>The basic excuse for watching the film is to see the amazing Russell Brand as the rock star trying to stay sober and free of drugs. Jonah Hill has done better in other films, especially as Matthew the Waiter, in the much better ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", of which this film is a spin off. Elisabeth Moss as Aaron's girlfriend, give us a break! No one can believe that one.

","If you want to laugh and are a fan of Jonah Hill I would suggest seeing this movie, I like Jonah Hill and how he has such a subtle sense of humor. Jonah Hill really made me laugh when he smoked that amazing joint. Without Jonah Hill this movie would have fallen flat. A couple of years ago, Russell Brand was thrown off the BBC for being naughty on the radio, and pundits suggested his career was dead. Today, he's a Hollywood film star. What do pundits know? I think he's funny, but in some scenes he's acting like a fag! Not like a real rock star. I think the movie crew didn't know difference between POP STAR & ROCK STAR!! One would think ""Get Him To The Greek"" is a re-imagining of ""My Favorite Year"" ain't??"

They were right, It was surprisingly very funny and entertaining. I laughed through the whole movie until the end.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, the only things I didn't like is Jonah Hill Pukes way too much, and there was so much sex and nudity it wasn't even sexy it was just raunchy."
"KnightsofNi11","7","3","8","23 August 2010"," Surprisingly great film
","Finally! A comedy that doesn't bank of copious amounts of stupidity and overused jokes to ""entertain"" its audience. Get Him to the Greek actually managed to entertain me enough to be considered not just another silly comedy. It's not to say that the film isn't silly, or raunchy, or over the top, but it's all done in a fashionable manner. It had me laughing practically through the entire film. In Get Him to the Greek Russell Brand reprises his role as Aldous Snow, a self destructive rock star whose first appearance was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall in 2008. At this point in time, however, Aldous is a has-been rocker after the utter failure of his last studio album. Jonah Hill plays Aaron Green who is a record company intern who is in charge of setting up Aldous Snow's reunion concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. Aldous proves to be absolutely uncontrollable and completely insane. He fits all the criteria of a true rock star. He's got a big personality and attitude, he's addicted to booze and women, and he's also on drugs. Lots of drugs. The ensuing journey is full of shocking hilarity and scandalous behavior.<br/><br/>The great thing about Get Him to the Greek is that it is just a comedy that pulls out all the ridiculous stops, but I can actually go as far to say that it is a well made film and slightly more credibility than just some good laughs. Russell Brand is hilarious as the overzealous drugged up rock star and Jonah Hill, while I do tire of his typecast role, does a great job here, stepping up his game to a slightly higher maturity level while still retaining his quirkiness. And Brand and Hill together as a pair do fantastic. Their chemistry is completely there and provides for some great character interaction with increasingly funny results. The supporting cast do a great job as well with people like Rose Byrn playing Aldous' ex-girlfriend Jackie Q who sports an adorably hilarious Australian/British hybrid accent. There is also P. Diddy Combs who plays the manager of the record company Aaron works for. He impressed me with some of the most twisted and monumentally funny moments of the whole movie. The whole cast has fun with this one and they don't refrain from going as far into the insane world of rock and roll as they can.<br/><br/>The other great thing about this movie is that it is a movie about rock and roll. It's a comedy first but it actually has legitimately rocking scenes that are so fun and exciting that you can't help but enjoy the rocking grandeur of this comedy. It's also helpful that the film succeeds on these levels so that some of the issues can be forgiven. There are definitely some plot holes and odd moments that make you do a double take as to how reasonable this plot really is. The film also does seem to get lost in itself towards the end. It randomly squeezes in a bit of philosophical intrigue towards the end that breaks the flow of the film to an extent. Problems like these are excusable against the funny and entertaining backdrop of this film.<br/><br/>In the long line of Apatow Production films Get Him to the Greek stands out as one of the funnier films. Its a great no holds bars comedy that you can find humor in somewhere. And despite the issues and the getting lost in itself, the film indeed has a heart. It's one of the few comedies that has come out in recent years that I would consider going back to re watch."

","Get him to the Greek was comedy perfection. If you liked the last 2 minutes of The Hangover... you may like this movie. However, it is going to be way more than most people will be able to take. This movie is 2 hours of what we had a glimpse of in the photos at the end of the Hangover. It is twisted and sick and I loved every moment of it! <br/><br/>If you are not easily offended, and can appreciate depravity, this may be the movie for you. It contains extreme drug and alcohol use, gratuitous sex and nudity, lots of vomit, and a general lack of respect for women, men, monogamy. Definitely NOT mainstream! <br/><br/>Although it may sound like it's a one dimensional movie, it really had subtle complexities. I am keeping out details as not to spoil anything... At one point, Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, was a little tiring. I felt that that was the intent, because the story absorbed it, recovered and I forgot all about it. At another point during the movie, it got insanely funny, milk coming out of your nose funny, and then turned again to something a little different. This time, it got bizarre. I think some people left the theater at this point. It wasn't funny, but I didn't feel like it was trying to be. It seemed as if the intention was to convey the uncomfortableness of the situation. If so, it was done wonderfully. <br/><br/>In the end, I really liked the characters Aldous and Aaron. I cared what happened to them and wanted things to work out for both of them. In spite of the extreme excesses portrayed in Get Him to the Greek, the movie got sweet at the end. it was a good ending to a completely insane movie. <br/><br/>If you like stupid comedies with a little toilet humor and some sex you should like it. Take the movie for what it is... a raunchy, hilarious, good time. Don't take it seriously and no matter what absolutely NO CHILDREN should watch this movie.<br/><br/>It's going on the shelf with my other favorites Dodgeball, Joe Dirt and Old School."

I liked the ties made within the movie to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and thought the parts in London were funny and a few parts in Las Vegas and scenes here and there were funny. But a lot of the jokes felt forced and didn't seem as funny. Overall I would saw one should wait for this to get to DVD and then rent or buy it, because while this is a decent movie, it isn't all its predecessor was, that movie was funny throughout and never had a dull moment where one is checking their watch. This movie some is hilariously funny but there is too much material that falls flat in between those."

","Jonah Hill plays Aaron a young music producer who likes musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) and he's been charged to ""Get Him to the Greek"". The beginning of that sentence sounds familiar because this film is ""based on characters created by Jason Segal"" (as written in the credits). At least they credited it correctly because they take nothing from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008). Just two of the same actors playing characters with some of the same superficial aspects and that's it.<br/><br/>I like Hill and Brand in small doses, but they just aren't likable and talented enough to carry an entire film. It was all unfunny jokes and dragged out ad nausea. I don't believe there was any spoofing going on here, just trying to steal some once funny lines. They had a character copying Isla Fisher from ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005) but she was just a cheap imitation.<br/><br/>""Get Him to the Greek"" didn't have anything very funny and nothing original and just wasn't well written. I would recommend re-watching ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""; it's just so much funnier and overall a better film."
"Bravesfan17","9","3","9","5 June 2010"," Very funny movie
","This movie is just as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, director Nicholas Stoller's debut as a director. He makes a very solid sophomoric effort here with Get Him to the Greek, which is a spin off on Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Stoller knows how to make the situations hilarious and how to make the laughs keep coming scene after scene.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is hilarious in the leading role as Aaron Green, a representative at a music company who has to get singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles in three days. Brand is a riot reprising his role as Aldous Snow. Brand shows that Aldous Snow is still just as ridiculous as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but he also shows us that there is to more to Aldous Snow than we thought we knew.<br/><br/>Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q, a singer and ex-girlfriend of Aldous. She does a fine job, but she isn't given a whole lot to do with this role. The same goes for Elisabeth Moss, who plays Aaron's girlfriend Daphne. Moss is given more to work with and she does a good job.<br/><br/>Sean Combs (a.k.a. P.Diddy) is a scene stealer and a hilarious supporting player as Sergio, Aaron's boss. Combs is a riot and shows that he can do comedy.<br/><br/>The laughs keep coming and the situations are absolutely laugh out loud funny. While not as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it is still a very solid effort from all involved. Judd Apatow is one of the best comedy producers out there today, and he proves it again here. If you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall, you should like Get Him to the Greek."

Jonah Hill and Russel brand seem to be a flawless duo in these roles;even if you normally find Brand a tad annoying. If this film was to be the ""sequel"" to Forgetting Sarah Marshall I would have to concede that it actually better than its predecessor. I'm afraid to ask but... Can I please have another?

","I'd give GHTTG a resounding 10/10, some great performances all round, especially from P Diddy who showed himself to have fine comic timing with some pretty decent acting skills. You could argue he was only playing himself, but he was playing himself on Jeffrey, which is another thing altogether. I know a lot of people have a problem with Russell Brand, but this film wouldn't have been the same without him. I cannot think of a single other actor who could have done the job so well, but this probably comes down to the fact that Russell, himself, is not exactly a million miles away from Aldous when it comes to excess. Truth be known, Aldous is probably a lightweight compared to Brand, and would need to make his excuses and leave when the naked Siamese twins sat astride a donkey holding a lucky bag full of narcotics rode into the suite. I honestly couldn't fault it, not a dull scene in the whole near two hours and it flew by.<br/><br/>""You can't outrun me, I'm a black man."""

Aaron Green (Hill) goes through the stereo typical drugs, women world that rock stars live in and tries to keep a relationship thriving with his live in girlfriend all the whilst trying to get Aldous Snow (Brandt) to the concert on time. Once again Jonah Hill does an awesome and comedic job, but i was very surprised on how funny Sean Combs was as his' do anything to get the job' done boss.

Every characters in this was hysterical to watch, especially cause of the funny but awkward dialogue that is exchange between the characters. P.Diddy was actually pretty good in this film as well, especially when he goes haywire. The story is pretty simple, it's about a rocker that has a name that should belong in some Harry Potter book hits rock bottom or just the lowest point in his career and the character played by Jonah Hill tries to get him to a Greek concert with the permission of the producer P.Diddy, although he doesn't allow it at first. Anyways there is a lot of random funny stuff that happens along the way, although the ending is actually quite predictable it's still a hilarious film even if the plot is typical of getting a guy from point A to point B.

"montera_iulian","7","2","6","28 July 2010"," Hilarious ""sequel"" to Aldous Snow's personal life since the events in Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","This movie rocked the audience for what it was supposed to deliver. Great humor, fun times and of course, ludicrous situations and hilarious interpretations of those two main characters; Aldous Snow and Aaron Green. The story in this movie is filled with great situations that you would laugh your ass off. It has it's clicheic ideas at moments and you get the feeling that it might turn cheesy but right next there's something insane happening. The two characters are portrayed excellent by both Russell Brand and Jonah Hill, Diddy gave a solid performance as the clicheic routine-type of boss but with all these points in favor, Get Him To The Greek lacks of a great ending which brought the whole movie to down from what could have turn. The ending felt like it's just too much and tried to scream for ""Hollywood Mainstream"". Why ruin a very good comedy with a typical ending I don't know... The lack of ideas maybe??? This movie delivered the expected although being better than it's predecessor it's a rough thing to say.<br/><br/>The execution of the movie was handled very well, the video editing and cinematography was something really really well handled offering some great visuals along the chaotic humor. Besides the technical aspect, Get him to the Greek felt like I've seen the best comedy this year but also felt like it tried too much. There were plenty of moments where you were not amazed but dumbed down by some situations which in a normal world wouldn't occur. What I've been dazzled about was though the Aldous Snow character which is so great written and played in such a wonderful manner by Russell Brand offering a visual entertaining face of the iconic rockstar that has everything a guy would want. The opposite, Aaron Green, is a nobody in world that has nothing to offer for him except him being an exception. Jonah Hill was so good in playing the insecure (clicheic) type of nerdie dude that clinches to his job and kiss ass in order to be recognized. There were so many funny moments were the actual hilarity stood in Jonah's ""straight-face"".<br/><br/>In the end, I think this movie deserves the title of the best comedy this year thus far but it also leaves the door open for other comedies to kick it's ass, not like Kick-Ass but more like some Hangover kick-ass. It feels like the typical summer comedy but it's not. It's a deserving hilarious ""sequel"" to Aldous Snow's personal life since the events in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and by doing almost just that it succeeds in entertaining the audience."

"SubterraneanHomesickAlien","7","2","6","11 July 2010"," Not Apatow's best, but still very funny!
","www.ourfilmreviews.com <br/><br/>Judd Apatow has elevated the genre of the raunchy-comedy to something more dignified and worthwhile than a sequence of scenes designed to gross you out. Ever since the release of his directorial debut, ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" Apatow has shown us that crude comedies can also have a lot of heart. The best film from the Apatow canon is ""Knocked Up,"" which he wrote and directed, but even the films that only bear his name as a producer have that same stamp of quality (""Pineapple Express,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marhsall""). The lowest film (and it is a very low, so low I pretend it doesn't exist), bearing his name is the abominable ""Year One,"" a film that Dani and I walked out of 20 minutes in. With that anomaly aside, Apatow has provided us with some of the best and funniest comedies of the 2000s, which seems only natural as he also provided us with the best TV show of the 90s, ""Freaks and Geeks"". Also from that show came the careers of James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel, all of whom appear in at least one Apatow film.<br/><br/>""Get Him to the Greek"" is another solid comedy from Apatow and his team. While it never achieves the hilarity of ""Superbad"" or ""Pineapple Express"" or the heart of ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" or ""Knocked Up,"" it still provides 109 minutes of good fun and a few big laughs. The film's plot is simple enough. If you want a synopsis just check out the trailer. It tells you everything you need to know. Jonah Hill is funny enough, but he lacks the charisma and depth of both Seth Rogen and Jason Segel. He is better suited in the supporting roles he usually plays. Russell Brand is also funny reprising his role from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" as the egomaniacal, brain-dead rock star Aldous Snow. But surprisingly, the funniest person in the movie is P.Diddy. I didn't know he could act or be funny, but he does an excellent deadpan.<br/><br/>This film succeeds for the same reason the other Apatow films succeed: It makes us laugh and also makes us care about whom we are laughing at. It is funny without feeling fake. So often comedies will have a character do something or act a certain way because it might be funny, but it betrays the authenticity of the character. As absurd as Aldous Snow may be, he and the rest of the characters in the film are acting out of real and identifiable human feelings and emotions, not out of a contrived and shallow script. We don't just see crude behavior for the sake of crude behavior. We understand the characters and the humanity behind what they do. And it is hilarious."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","6","7 July 2010"," Enough immoral and outrageous fun for a good time at the movies
","If the cliché ""sex, drugs and rock 'n roll"" has seemed obscured or irrelevant the last thirty years, it is no longer. ""Get Him to the Greek"" serves this unholy trinity buffet style. The latest Judd Apatow-produced laugh fest is a spin-off on the character Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" the licentious rock star with a drug addiction. How else, then, do you make a film about a walking stereotype other than expounding on the stereotypes? ""Greek"" suggests you roll with it, which is easy enough.<br/><br/>There's not much of a story here, which limits what this movie can ultimately do, but there's just enough to get the ball rolling. Jonah Hill stars (in a role different than his ""Sarah Marshall"" character) as Aaron, an aspiring music producer working for millionaire music mogul (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs), who suggests they throw a 10-year anniversary concert featuring Snow's band Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater, a move which could help the label and resurrect the sunken career of his favorite frontman.<br/><br/>He is then charged with the responsibility of personally escorting Mr. Snow from London to the Today Show for a live appearance and performance and then to Los Angeles for the concert. Given Snow's reputation and bacchanalian tendencies, this task will prove much more difficult than the straight-laced Aaron could ever anticipate.<br/><br/>What follows is the sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, but mostly drugs. About every scene involves at minimum the consumption of alcohol. If Aaron is not being tempted into it, he needs it to take the edge off because babysitting Snow is a painstaking endeavor. Producer/director Nicholas Stoller, understanding his film is both literally and figuratively laced with substance abuse, doesn't treat it like a physical gag that needs building up to like every other film with a clichéd ""drug scene."" He uses quick sequences with rapid-fire shots that while seemingly rushed at the time, get the point across without calling any more attention to it than the film already does. This is of course with the exception of the climactic drug scene toward the end when it all hits the fan. <br/><br/>Comedian Brand actually plays Snow with unexpected dignity in this film. Here's the potential to just go batty and ridiculous, but Brand tastefully realizes that this is part of Snow's make up; he doesn't need to externalize it with raucous and stumbling behavior. There's also a very human element to the story as we learn Snow's behavior is largely tied to his split from longtime girlfriend and the mother of his children, Jackie Q (Rose Byrne). <br/><br/>Then again, the sentimental aspect weakens ""Greek"" in terms of its lasting impression. It's a bit unrealistic to expect that a film basking in loose morals could possibly have morals of its own and convey them with legitimacy. Aaron too has a love sub plot: his long-term girlfriend (""Mad Men's"" Elisabeth Moss) and he get in a fight right before he leaves for London. Stoller admirably hopes to touch the heart as well as the funny bone by keeping these threads going throughout the adventure, but it keeps ""Greek"" from building into the comedic hurricane its ""less plot, more fun"" premise suggests (and many fans were likely expecting).<br/><br/>As outrageous as ""Get Him to the Greek"" behaves at times, it will manage to bring just about anyone with a raunchy sense of humor aboard for its shameless and sinful ride. Even Diddy has his moments in a cast of solid characters whose stories might be weak, but performances reflect the underlying maturity that Apatow films have been known for in spite of the boundary-pushing sex and drugs humor.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"sebrat","4","2","6","7 July 2010"," So much potential
","I'm a fairly rabid Brand fan, mostly because he brings a sense of philosophy and sophistication to his truly crass comic material that is unseen with most modern comedians. Accordingly, I went through to Get Him To The Greek with high expectations. The opening scene - a hilarious satire of Bono/Geldof-style charity music videos - had me just about convinced that this would live up to Brand's reputation. Sadly, for the rest of the film his own comic sensibilities jar somewhat with Stoller's awkward scripting. Every part of me wanted to like this film, even the reliance on toilet humour and unfunny celebrity cameos. It worked about 50% of the time, hence the score. What I see in place of a really good movie is a really good idea that could have, with the right people at the helm, become a classic rock 'n' roll spoof in the vein of Spinal Tap and The Rutles. Instead it's a generic, bombastic '00s Hollywood comedy script crafted around the music business."

Puff Daddy, P.

She has one of the funnier scenes later in the film that helps give it the R rating. What else gives it the hard R rating is some nudity, language and a lot of drug use.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate it an 8 or 9 with the only drawback is that my friend that I saw it with - we both thought the film sagged a bit at the end, but then brought it back with a closing funny scene that referenced something earlier in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, the film ""works"" in the grand outrageous style of The Hangover, Borat, etc. I will see it again."

","I've recently watched and reviewed actor Jonah Hill's directorial debut in his coming of age skatepark drama ""mid90s"" which impressed me, so I wanted to check out his other work. I haven't seen Jonah Hill in a lead role before, and neither Russell Brand who I was also impressed by in his voice acting role in ""Trolls."" I was excited to see these two leads together in one film because I think they are funny, intelligent actors who normally get more sidekick, supporting roles. Dunno why I haven't heard about ""Get Him to the Greek"" (2010) before here in 2019, but I am glad to see it featured in HBO's Amazon Prime channel because it is a fantastic comedy that had me and my sister laughing.<br/><br/>""Get Him to the Greek"" has kind of a diabolical ""South Park"" bent, especially with the antics of Russell Brand's character and his spoof ""African Child"" music video which opens the film. I love ""South Park,"" I enjoyed this film. There's a similar satire, self-awareness, childish but unsentimental quality that comes across as brutal but refreshing, while still being funny. In one scene maniacal music manager P. Diddy gets hit by a car and then chastises Jonah Hill for not picking up his phone when even he did. Later Russell Brand shows his broken arm to P. Diddy and they laugh it off as ""just a scratch"" and continue their show.<br/><br/>Other than ""South Park,"" ""Get Him to the Greek"" has the same type of humor as ""The Hangover"" as well as those same endearing parts. While it doesn't fully land, Russell Brand has good acting moments as popular but lonely rock star propped up by idiot lies.<br/><br/>Everyone in ""Get Him to the Greek,"" even Brand, is a bit of a dork, with much too much eagerness to please. The characters are written as lovable but realistic simpletons who do stupid things which are bad ideas, but are well intentioned enough. This makes them pretty enjoyable to watch in what is ultimately a very simple (but effective) point A to point B story. Kudos."

","Forgive me up front by saying: I truly believe both Johan Hill and Russell Brand might very well be comic geniuses. And this is coming from someone who only liked Brand in small doses, but always loved Hill.<br/><br/>Here, in the faux-pas sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, they're both absolutely hilarious and despite the movie being a tad uneven and overlong, I had a great time with the misadventures of Hill's Aaron Green character who needs to lead his rock idol from London to L.A. for a reunion concert.<br/><br/>One Sunday, well, yesterday, I vegged by watching four movies and left this one for last – if I got to it, that is. It appears I did save the best for last, for, I had the most fun during this than the previous three movies, two of which, were supposedly cult comedies.<br/><br/>Normally, I would provide a synopsis, but I pretty much already did. Music recording enterprise employee, Aaron, must hand deliver Russell Brand's aging rock star, Aldous Snow, from England to several U.S. cities while trying to deal with both the crazy antics of the druggie has-been Aldous, his own possible ex-lover, Daphne and his eccentric boss, Sergio, played wonderfully by Sean Combs.<br/><br/>Like I already reported, the movie is a tad uneven as told with the sometimes directionless plot and clichéd shenanigans, but the basic concept keeps us entertained until the ""big show"" that will both further Aaron and Aldous's career.<br/><br/>I really did laugh out loud a lot during this movie and was sad that I missed it when it was released almost 3 years ago. It's not a movie I would want to buy, but I am glad I got a chance to see it, finally.<br/><br/>I know this is short, but, let me assure you, it is hilarious in most scenes, thanks to both Hill and Brand and all the secondary characters with inside jokes. It's highly recommended."

","When I saw ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" I thought Jonah Hill was criminally underused, and thankfully this spin-off makes up for the damage. There was just so much juice left in that character, and it's all squeezed out here. Granted, it's barely the same character anymore (the obsessed fan schtick is mostly dropped), but the chemistry with Russell Brand is still very much there. And his girlfriend is Elizabeth Moss, that helps. The story isn't that inspired to say the least (trying to get somewhere but encountering troubles, AKA the plot to 80% of all comedies), but the great interaction between our main duo really manages to keep this show on the road. Even if some of the lines fall flat here and there, you just can't stay mad at this movie. Not great, but definitely good for some laughs."

","Aaron Green (Hill) has 72-hrs to get a fading rock star Aldous Snow (Brand) to the comeback concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>I thought this movie would be a complete disaster. In the beginning all I heard was obscene language, watched obscene sight gags, watched barfing as though the whole world thought that was funny, and listened to sexually explicit songs and also listened to fouled mouthed people who had no fear of using sexual body parts as part of their normal conversations. I wanted to shut this down, but I took a chance and waited until all the ugliness was out and eventually most of it was out, not entirely, mind you, but the worst parts were over. Then the story started. Oh, there were still foul mouthed people spewing their stuff, but it became no different than any other movie with bad language. Good God, am I getting used to this stuff?<br/><br/>To continue a little bit with the story, Aaron has a very hard time getting a difficult out-of-control drugged up rock star to do what he must do to get back his rock-star career back. But, in order to get the job done and appease this rock star, Aaron ends up doing things he doesn't want to do, drink a lot, do drugs and have sex with other women. Have to admit some of those scenes were only funny when he was out of it via drink, and drugs and was not very graceful on his feet. There should have been more of those scenes because some slapstick was definitely called for. Otherwise nothing else was funny. <br/><br/>What held me was the performance of Russell Brand. He was in his element or zone and although he also spewed foul language as called for in the script, he sometimes mumbled but you got the gist of what he was saying and that was sort of a reprieve for me not to hear the words. Jonah Hill was kind of miscast as he brought nothing to the table because his character was too low-keyed and he was not given any memorable lines. He was only funny when he was knocking things over in his drunken druggy stupors. Surprisingly that worked. <br/><br/>Cameos: Mario Lopez, Billy Bush, Pink, Christine Aguilera, Meredith Vieria and others of lesser notoriety. <br/><br/>Why these foul mouthed comedies appeal to the populace is beyond me, but they continue to try to outdo the previous same kind of foul mouthed sexual misadventure ""comedic"" movies. Comedy in America is dead. Now, all we have is bathroom humor. Sad. Soooo, not a complete disaster, but real close. <br/><br/>Violence: No Sex Yes. Nudity: Yes. Drug usage: Yes.

"Chris Knipp","6","2","7","7 June 2010"," Get him back to rehab?
","n this new movie from the Judd Apatow comedy factory, a Hollywood recording company flack called Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) has the job of getting wildly unreliable, substance-abusing English rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from London to LA for a concert in three days. He succeeds, just barely. And so does this unruly movie succeed, just barely, in entertaining you -- if gross-out parties and sex and such are your thing.<br/><br/>Here's how Apatow movies work. The personnel move around and ideas are spun off earlier movies. Stoller, once an assistant and collaborator on Apatow's TV series ""Undeclared,"" directed the 2008 Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his first feature, using a screenplay by Jason Segal and starring Jason as a character spun off Segal's original daddy-of-them-all ""Freaks and Geeks"" TV series' lovelorn kid persona, Nick Andopolis. Brand was woven into Forgetting Sarah Marshall as the Aldous Snow character. It was a minor role, but one of the highlights of the movie. So why not spin out Aldous Brand into a screenplay devoted to him as the main character? And that's what they did. The question is whether Brand, a stand-up comic, is endurable over the length of a whole movie. Get Him to the Greek, a disheveled road movie with echoes of Todd Philips' very successful 2009 The Hangover (whose praise and profits these folks were doubtless not unaware of), is just a series of skits with a lot of barfing and partying. It's got its funny moments, and Brand is still himself a pretty droll fellow, but the story is very repetitive. (Economics commentator Paul Krugman and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich are woven into this in cameos, but we doubt they'll have Apatow comedies spun out of their characters.)<br/><br/>Apatow comedies involve a revolving list of co-conspirators who alternately act in, write, produce, or direct movies. Addous Snow, the outrageous, funny, sort of cool and sexy rock singer who keeps this movie going, is played by Russell Brand, a British comic who looks and dresses much like his character and, as detailed in his 2007 autobiography My Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs, and Stand-Up, once acted just like him too -- only, if anything, quite a lot worse. The difference is that Brand in real life has been clean and sober for years and regularly attends 12-Step meetings. Like Robert Downey Jr., he has lived the debauched addict life to the hilt (complete with nearly a dozen arrests) and so when he acts such a character, he's playing a version of himself. Brand's character, Aldous, went straight for a few years also, but then party-time began again, causing his longtime girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), also a famous rocker, to cut off relations. Aaron's boss's idea is that a concert by Aldous commemorating a famous evening at the Greek Theater in LA ten years earlier when he was at his peak of popularity will revive both Aldous' fortunes and the company's.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is practically a comedy factory of his own by now. He was in the cornerstones of the Apatow movie empire, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. He's just a straight man here, and to emphasize his straightness, he has a workaholic doctor-in-training girlfriend played by Mad Men's Elizabeth Moss. What's a nice girl like her doing in a gross-out comedy like this? The tone of Get Him to the Greek can be wildly uneven. As Aaron Green's record company boss Sergio Roma we have Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs, whose crisp delivery and absolute self-possession in his scenes seem to belong to a more verbal comedy with sharper timing. The British actors playing Aldous' mum and dad (Diana Stabb and Colm Meaney) come from a more realistic kind of comedy. There are mock-ups of rock videos by Aldous and Jackie Q, including Aldous' bomb, ""African Child,"" a mockery of rock stars' self-appointed and utterly skin-deep save-the-world poses. Brilliantly realized and perhaps the best things in the film, these again belong to something else, something parodic and outrageously witty, something with an elaborate, gorgeous mise-en-scène. But the base line of the movie unfortunately is simply crudeness, as exemplified by the parties where girls take their boobs out and the sequence when Aldous forces Aaron to place a balloon of heroin up his rectum on the way through airport security, or the (ha ha ha, ho ho ho) scenes when the obliging flack has to smoke a lethal joint called a Jeffrey or chug vodka and quickly becomes falling-down, upchucking sick-drunk.<br/><br/>Russell Brand still is funny; and he delivers his rock singing sequences with impressive panache and some singing talent (some of the songs, though, are just utterly crude and tasteless). This time, Jason Segal is given a partial writing credit just for the ""characters' and Stoller himself did the screenplay; I'm not sure how good a writer Stoller is. There's not much room for character development in Aaron and Aldous' 24-hour-party trip. Take a look at Forgetting Sarah Marshall again. Jason Segal's lovesick guy was a well-honed persona, a character it's easy to sympathize with who has some depth. Feeling sorry for that guy and feeling sorry for Aldous Snow are two different things. Drunken addict behavior is colorful and exciting, alright (like a train wreck), but it's not very funny to watch somebody ruining his life. There are some keen observations about the addict mindset here. In Drugstore Cowboy the main character says the drug addict has control over how he feels because he creates his moods with chemicals. Similarly Aldous says his life is simple because his only worry is where his next high is coming from. He also has a suicidal moment, and performs on stage while badly injured because doing so brings joy to his audience and to him. In this sense Get Him to the Greek has a nice ending. But it take too long to get there."
"forkingpaths","10","2","7","6 June 2010"," Crude but brilliant
","Get Him to the Greek is an entirely different creature than Forgetting Sarah Marshall, so if you are looking for a Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2, you will be sorely disappointed. If, however, you're looking for a roller coaster ride of depravity, crudity, mockery, and unfathomably grotesque yet ridiculously funny, this is the movie for you. I have not laughed so much or so hard in a movie in a long time. <br/><br/>The Aldous Snow we see here was not quite the character we might have expected from the brief caricature we glimpsed in Forgetting Sarah Marshall; but then, the Aldous Snow we see in Get Him to the Greek is a creature so riddled with drugs and alcohol, he hardly knows where he is from one day to the next. Heck, we hardly know what to expect from him one minute to the next, which is half the fun. Russell Brand's Aldous Snow was brilliant, and displayed Brand's versatility. This Aldous Snow was believable (much more so than the Aldous we loved from FSM). He was in turn hilarious, tragic, overstated, insightful, overbearing, stubborn, demanding, and sarcastic as I could have hoped for. Did I mention hilarious? <br/><br/>Sean Combs was the big surprise. Sergio - what can I say about Sergio? The best lines in the movie were given to Sergio, and I am not sure many could have pulled them off as brilliantly as Sean Combs did. I will be laughing for weeks."

There were some funny things, but it is just not enough for a whole movie. And Jonah Hill comes back playing a different character.<br/><br/>The whole African Child video in the beginning was funny, perhaps the best part. But the movie tries to get most of its laughs by having the characters do crazy stuff while high instead of having funny situations like in FSM. Also, besides African Child the movie didn't use enough of Aldous's crazy song lyrics.<br/><br/>P Diddy is in this and plays a record executive that only knows how to cuss all the time. It's cute the first couple of times but good comedic writing needs more than dirty words to be funny.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's got some laughs, but don't expect anything great.

It is sporadically amusing, some of the gross humour is funny and Brand manages to be just on the right side of being frazzled rock star without getting too irritating.

","So I watched 2010's raunchy comedy ""get him to the Greek"". So was it good, I say ehh.. it started good.

He is an odd ex drug addict, who is sexy and looks like a rocker, so he is perfectly cast here. It also stars P-diddy as a record label owner a role he is well suited for. Additionally, it stars Jonah Hill who is very finny, and several supporting roles all done well. This movie starts awesome. It has sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, all with raunchy humor and an interesting take on the classic road trip theme used by movies. However, the third act doesn't just feel weird and out of place it also feels awkward. The film comes back together by the final sequence, but by then I at least lost interest. This movie is geared more towards stoners, raunchy comedy fans, and the youth of this world. If you are not part of this demographic you will probably not care for this film much, and if you are, you may find yourself rolling on the floor in laughter until the third act when you may find yourself saying ""what?"". if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

This particular sub genre includes movies like ""Stepbrothers"", ""Superbad"", and the too-famous-for-its-own-good ""The Hangover"", and the (fairly) newly released ""Get Him to the Greek"". I find the humor to be verywell, stupid, the plots lacking, and overall they're just poorly put together pieces of crap that requires an IQ of ""Meathead"" or less to not only comprehend but enjoy. And I am a snob and am therefore too good to get any sort of entertainment out of such frivolous movies. They just seem like a waste of time and production money that could be used for bigger and better things. Like a movie about the sinkhole in Guatemala. But I digress:<br/><br/>It is with this blatant, loud and proud hatred of mine I'd like you to keep in mind when I tell you what I think about GHttG: This may have been the funniest movie I have seen all year.<br/><br/>I almost find it disappointing how much I like this movie. I keep watching movies that are surprisingly good and it's making it really hard to bitch about them, and that's the fun part for me when I write these reviews. But no, ""Greek"" was a ridiculously funny movie and as much as it kills me to admit it, Reader, I really really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The plot is simple; Aaron Green works for P. Diddy (uh, I mean ""Sergio"") who owns a music production company of some ambiguous nature. Aaron comes up with an idea to get the company more money; the famous rock star Aldous Snow can do a 10th anniversary concert at the Greek theater in LA. Sergio Diddy agrees, and sends Aaron to London to fetch Aldous and well, ""Get Him to the Greek"". He's got three days. Simple, no?<br/><br/>No. <br/><br/>Turns out, and this is quite a stretch, Aldous is quite the junkie, and he keeps messing around and getting Aaron to do all sorts of crazy, drug-addled things that basically generate lots of lulz for the audience at the expense of Aaron's health, his relationship with his girlfriend, and his sanity.<br/><br/>But even good movies have their faults, and the flick in my opinion took a turn for the worst when it started to do that ""gooey touchy feely"" thing all comedies seem to do at least once. It even sort of started to take on an agenda as the issue of Aldous's drug use became more and more of a problem for Aaron, but the movie ended with a bang and was overall a really enjoyable experience.

"pcongleton-1","7","1","3","18 June 2010"," I feel like I have seen this movie many times before.
","I have been a fan of Russell Brand for a while now, but not for his movies. This is actually my first film of his that I have seen. I got to know him from his various appearances on Letterman and Conan O'Brien. Anyway, I was excited to see one of his films finally. Jonah Hill plays a normal guy who works as an intern in the offices of a music business and gets the unwitting opportunity to pitch a concert idea to his boss (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), that involves bringing Russell's character back to the States for a concert in L.A. Unfortunately, the Director/Writer of the film picks a tired, overused character design in the guise of the typical drug-ridden, big-haired, British-1980s-like star who has seen better days and needs a come-back scenario that has been seen and heard time after time. The comedy unfolds methodically in the beginning, dishing out the laughs at a slow boil. Or, at least, it felt like that. The movie starts out slow in the beginning, gets going in the middle but crashes in the end. By the time you get to the end of the movie you do not like any of the characters and the message, although received is ignored because we have heard it a million times. Brand is very talented. He has a wonderful scene where he calls his ex-girlfriend and finally you begin to like this guy, but it is a little too late. Hill just seemed to be there, although he had his moments. Diddy steals the show. He has the most laughs but like everyone else in the movie you just want to punch him out. What we have here is a cute, funny, enjoyable attempt and a film worth seeing at least once, but overall it is repetitive and unoriginal. It felt like they needed to force the comedy out and needed a Herculean effort just to execute, even, the potty-humor."
"dfranzen70","7","1","3","13 June 2010"," A laugh riot in spots
","Get Him to the Greek has moments of riotous hilarity, pockmarked with only a few scenes that try a little too hard to be effectively sentimental. The yin/yang chemistry between Russell Brand as a druggie rock star and Jonah Hill is believable and entertaining, and aside from the typical awkward nonslapstick scenes from writer Judd Apatow, the movie generally works.<br/><br/>Aldous Snow (Brand), introduced in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, is now a washed-up rocker. He's been on the wagon, then off it. His band, Infant Sadness, hasn't played in ten years. Then a young record-company intern named Aaron Green (Hill) gets the idea of having the band reunite for a tenth anniversary show at the famed Greek Theater in Los Angeles. Aaron's high-octane boss Sergio (P. Diddy) instructs his charge to jet to London, gather up Snow and fly him to New York to be on the Today Show, then fly him to LA for the reunion show. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>It actually does, too. Naturally, Aaron and Aldous are complete opposites – one a party-hardy hedonist and one more of a button-down, take-no-chances drip, one who has many brief encounters with the female kind and one who is just coming out of a long-term relationship. Or so he thinks, anyway. And as much as Aaron wants to get things moving along, Aldous wants to tarry and enjoy life a bit longer, sort of a microcosm of their individual lives up to that point.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that each does a little bit of growing up along the way. But we're not meant to focus on that. Instead, Aaron and Aldous experience wacky escapades along the lines of Bachelor Party, with echoes of Pulp Fiction and The Hangover. What makes it all work is that it's not just one zany scene after another; director Nicholas Stoller tosses in some serious moments that are meant to humanize Aldous a bit more and take the edge off a little.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is effective in part because Brand is such a gifted comic who's made the Aldous Snow character his own. Brand as Snow electrifies the room when he walks in, sort of what you'd expect from a glamorous rocker. Even one who has some deep-seated issues of his own. See, the movie moves along pretty damn well when it's concentrating on the wackiness, with a smidge of seriousness thrown in, but when too much focus is diverted to those serious psychological issues, then it sort of crumbles. And it's not just issues with Aldous Snow, either; there are a few that try to work out Aaron's own problems (although for most of the movie he's befuddled and along for the ride, a well-meaning patsy).<br/><br/>In particular, there is one scene near the end in which Aldous attempts to help Aaron and his girlfriend Daphne resolve their differences. Like with the more serious scenes in Forgetting Sarah Marshall – also directed by Stoller, and the movie to which this is sort of a sequel – the scene seems pointless and jarring. It's the opposite of what you, as viewer, want to see, as it's neither sexy nor funny nor illuminating.<br/><br/>Another slight debit is P. Diddy. The man can play unhinged well, but he's not always funny here – sometimes he just comes off as a mean jerk. And not in the Mr. Dithers (boss of Dagwood Bumstead) way, either, not in the comically inept gangster way, just sort of sour and bitter. A little more work might help him, since I believe this was his first comedic attempt. And for a first attempt, it ain't bad.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that Get Him to the Greek is really funny for a good portion of the film, with only a few dips into ill-advised sentimentality that just isn't effective and even helps kill the mood. Both Brand and Hill are well cast and are hysterical."

Russell Brand's Aldus Snow is a hilarious character that worked much better as a minor ""just for the fun"" one. <br/><br/>As I remember, their stuff in ""Sarah Marshall"" delivered pretty much the greatest laughs of the movie (here Jonah Hill plays a completely different character tough). It was a simple situation: rock star dealing with a fan, (who is basically in love with him). Here we have a similar situation: same rock star dealing with a young man who works in the music business and who is also a huge fan. Laughs? Yes, we do have laughs, is pretty much inevitable having a guy like Brand (I would say ""like Hill"" too but like I said, he is losing it and certainly a not- just-for-the-fun part, the exact we have here, doesn't fit him extremely well) but the movie never really feels like something fresh, like something worthy. It's a movie to see only once, that's for sure. 6.5 out of 10"

","Its rare when a sequel tops the original. The Dark knight did, T2 did, Star wars did, but those are the only ones I can think of. Some sequels aren't necessary. Home alone is that way. So was Bruce almighty, and The Mask didn't need one either. Get him to the Greek is sort of a sequel. It doesn't top the original, and it's unnecessary. But still a good movie.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill doesn't reprise his role as the desperate waiter who loves Aldous Snow(Russell Brand). He does love Aldous Snow, but this time he isn't trying to get famous, he's trying to Get Aldous back on track.<br/><br/>Snow's career went downhill after this horrible album called African child. So, 10 years after he performed at The Greek theatre, he's going back. In hopes to boost his career back. So Aaron must get him to the theatre in 3 days.<br/><br/>The movie is very funny when it tries. The moments with Sean Combs(Didi) especially. But somethings about this movie didn't work for me. The movie doesn't follow it's timeline. Two years ago, he was dating Sarah Marshall. And now, according to Get him to the Greek, he has a kid? What? We don't want to see Aldous the family man. It's lame.<br/><br/>I'm a little mixed on Jonah Hill I like him sometimes, but sometimes he's very annoying. He's not very annoying here, but he's still sort of annoying. I'd of thought that Aldous Snow having his own movie would be great. Russell Brand is obviously hilarious. And a lovable lead. But unfortunately, he's given a story line that falls flat. I understand why they brought him back. I liked the movie. But it could've been better.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I am a 'Sorrow Sucker', which Aldous nicknamed his fans. I loved that movie. I liked Get him to the Greek, but I feel it lacks something. It lacks something that that movie had. Can't put my finger on it. Brand should not be punished. It's disappointing, but still occasionally hilarious.<br/><br/>B-"

","Nicholas Stoller's 'Get Him To The Greek' is a film that never promised path-breaking Cinema, so it's non-stop madness, doesn't really gulp in a bad taste. It's a stupid film, with idiotic moments, but one can't deny that you laugh in some of the portions, at the right time! <br/><br/>'Get Him To The Greek' is about a rock-star, who's in the dumps. Entry, a low-level talent scout at Pinnacle Records, who makes the appointed rock-star come back in the day.<br/><br/>Some jokes are truly hilarious. The funniest is the one, where Jonah Hill is forced by Brand to put up drugs in his bum! At the same time, some moments are absurd and very unfunny. The Threesome Sequence is horrible and fails to evoke a inch of smile. What made them to even think a sequence like that?? <br/><br/>Nicholas Stoller's direction is fair. His writing, is flawed. Robert Yeoman's Cinematography is average. Acting wise, Jonah Hill is fantastic. He handles himself wonderfully even the most absurd situations. Russell Brand is bland. For him, making morbid faces and expressions is humor! Elisabeth Moss is flawless. A true talent! Rose Byrne is perfect.<br/><br/>On the whole, Watch this one if must. Not really recommended!"
"chrichtonsworld","4","1","4","21 September 2010"," Honestly I laughed real hard at a few scenes,but overall this is one disappointing affair
","The introduction had me rolling around and laughing so hard that I could not expect that this movie would be disappointing. Some of the jokes were too much of the gross factor. Who are these people that think vomit is funny. It is just incredibly nasty. Russel Brand is obvious the highlight of the movie and he was as great as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. However for some strange reason he isn't the lead. And this ultimately bombs the movie. While Jonah Hill has some comedic timing he just isn't right as a lead. And he has no range at all. It seems he always seems to be playing the same character. Russel Brand went from hilarious to some serious acting in no time. And one other surprise is Sean Combs in a parody of himself which was quite funny. While there were some real funny moments it didn't last long enough to carry the whole movie. Comedies are meant to be fun not disgusting."
"filmbantha","6","1","4","6 July 2010"," Forgetting Aldous Snow
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a dull, unfunny comedy, in fact I would go as far to say that it wasn't comedy but a boring drama. It pains me every time i hear someone mention how brilliant it was, and I really can't comprehend why anyone commissioned a spin-off, on second thoughts scrap that, Forgetting Sarah Marshall made money at the box office, so of course we are going to get a lacklustre follow-up, none other than Get him to the Greek.<br/><br/>The story follows Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) as he attempts to escort Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his long overdue comeback gig but struggles to keep the dishevelled rock star away from drink, drugs and desperate women. It sounds like the perfect recipe for a comedy but unfortunately it appears that the writers created a number of key scenes and then attempted to loosely tie them together with a script, and that will never work.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the majority of the jokes are clearly aimed at a teenage audience when references to The Mars Volta and Lars Ulrich clearly pay off, film-makers should realise that not everyone in the world is a hormonal teenage lad, desperate for a glimpse of nudity or endless toilet humour, but have faith that intelligent people are out there! Maybe they are just too on the ball and realise that anyone with half an ounce of intelligence will probably steer clear of this film. Admittedly, some of the jokes did bring a smile to my face, but this was not nearly enough to redeem the lack of structure and poor characterisation.<br/><br/>If you like your films without meaning, easy to follow and easy to forget, go and watch Get Him to the Greek, the perfect throwaway Summer comedy. Just don't say I didn't warn you!"

","I didn't really know what to think of this movie when I went in. Is it a sequel? Is it a spin-off? What is it? Well, the answer to that is, Who Cares? It was funny! Jonah Hill always plays a great underdog character and Russell Brand is hilarious as always. The humor is pretty raunchy at times and if you're easily offended you may want to pass, particularly if anal references disturb you. Otherwise get ready for some great laughs. I even found myself listening to the song lyrics and laughing because they are so over the top.<br/><br/>One thing I wasn't expecting was Sean Combs.

","In Get Him To The Greek, Jonah Hill plays Aaron, an assistant for record producer Sergio (Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs). When Aaron is sent to pick up Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), a washed out, alcoholic rock star who is performing at a theater in California, Aaron figures out it's not as easy as it appear. The film then goes into a raunchy but hilarious film that makes my list as one of the funniest films thus far this year. Jonah Hill has learned to become a good, funny actor without being consistently wacky, and Brand is also very funny, and as a former alcoholic, very authentic in his performance. The real scenery chewer, though, is Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs who had me falling out of my seat with laughter every time he came on screen. He was a fresh idea rolled up in a very funny character. I also liked the music. Yes, Brand's Snow is supposed to be making fun of the rock music world, but his voice and the execution make his music surprisingly good. The one complaint I did have is the last 20 minutes or so, which goes on for way too long and gets too sappy. I think they really wanted to make their point but they tried to make it too hard. That said, Get Him To The Greek is a funny, well made raunchfest that also has a heart and soul to it."
"jdesando","Null","1","4","6 June 2010"," It's all Greek to me.
","Everything in Get Him to the Greek gets carried over: Director Nicholas Stoller steals broken-down Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from Stoller's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and producer Judd Apatow offers some homoerotic low jokes from Knocked Up with touches of bromance from The Hangover and I Love You, Man.<br/><br/>Greek is not funnier by far than any of the recent male-bashing, chauvinistic romantic comedies, but it has moments of rock-star bashing and music industry mashing that save it from true crashing. Russell Brand's Snow is believably degenerate while displaying some wisdom about the world for the innocents abroad with him.<br/><br/>Aaron Green (Jonah Hill), a greenhorn intern for a large music company, owned by Sergio Roma (a terrific Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), is sent to London to bring back for a renewal concert bad-boy Snow in a concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. The mayhem has the usual wanton groupies, drugs in a scatological logistic new even for jaded bromance mongers, and throwing up that is just not pretty or important.<br/><br/>Brand and P. Diddy save the movie from boredom, and the issue of doing what one loves gets some play both from rocker Snow and operative Aaron, whose medical intern girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) wants to move for a residency to Seattle. The tension between her as an accomplished young professional and Aaron as a smitten Snow fan, and thus naïve, plays out as a credible argument during the narrative. Snow's attempt to reconnect with previous wife Jackie Q (Rose Byrn) is less believable again because the man seems so much less mature than the woman.<br/><br/>That the attractive young Daphne could love the man/boy schlub Aaron is just one of many stretches that melodramatic bromance demands. Rock 'n Roll will survive as will Judd Apatow and immature men. I just hope Daphne becomes a doctor specializing in rock degeneracy. There's a future there."

","A young intern at a record company is given the task of escorting an old and out of control rock star to the Greek theatre, for a comeback gig that will earn the company millions. <br/><br/>Was the character from Forgetting Sarah Marshall really likable, or popular enough to warrant a spin-off film? Someone thought so, thus we have Get Him To The Greek, where Russell Brand plays Aldous Snow. While he has had smaller roles in other films, it's this flick and Marshall, where people recognize him. Those who do not know this is a spin off might think he is a note note actor. We'll see when more work goes his way. Jonah Hill does his thing, make snide comic remarks at situations that seem to be one of the chosen bits from a line- o-rama piece. Just have him stand there, spit out random things that are funny and we'll pick the best one. I hope his style doesn't get old fast, or he's in trouble. <br/><br/>The film works for the most part, it's not as funny as you'd want it to be. The people that make this film funny are the supporting characters. Brand and Hill are probably the least funniest thing about this film. Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs stands out, surprisingly. He has the comedic chops that fit this film and he worked it well. Colm Meaney, a character actor notorious for playing a-holes is hilarious as Snow's father. His scenes are great as well.<br/><br/>Get Him To The Greek is mild entertainment, there are far more funnier films out there than this one and the characters are pretty generic that you don't seem to care if they make it to the theatre or not. One of the weaker Apatow style films, which is a shame because it has a lot of talent. Get Him To The Greek, is as I initially expected, a mediocre comedy that barely gets the laughs out. Still, it's funnier than a lot of comedies that came out the same year."
"Hellmant","9","1","5","28 September 2010"," The humor is pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time!
","'GET HIM TO THE Greek': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Nicholas Stoller writes and directs this sequel / spin-off to his surprise 2008 hit 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', which he directed and actor Jason Segel wrote. This film centers around only the outrageous British rock star Aldous Snow (played once again, hilariously, by Russell Brand) and a record company intern (played by returning actor Jonah Hill, but weirdly not as the same character 'Matthew the Waiter'). This film tells the story of Aaron Green (Hill) trying to get Snow to a reunion concert at L.A.'s Greek Theater from London in something like three days. The concert was his idea and his chance to prove himself to his boss (played humorously by Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs) but Snow is suffering through a midlife crisis and turns out to be impossible to control. All kinds of hijinks ensue as Green desperately tries to get Snow to the concert in time.<br/><br/>The movie is just one witty and hilariously outrageous joke after another but then it surprisingly turns dramatic and at times serious as we get to know the characters more and it actually builds to a pretty emotional climax. This is my favorite type of comedy. Not only is it nonstop hilarious but it has heart and real emotion as well because the characters feel real and we actually get to see their problems.<br/><br/>The film is not quite as classic as 'MARSHALL' and it definitely doesn't benefit from the stunningly graceful beauty of Kristin Bell, although she does make a cameo appearance, but it's about as good as you could expect from a followup to that film, which is one of my favorites. The humor is all pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time. It's brilliantly written and directed by Stoller and both Brand and Hill are classic in the film. They're both comedic genius in my mind!

","I wasn't that big of a fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I was seemingly interesting in seeing how this film would be. I recently watched this film and thought it was great and very funny at many scenes. Though, its humour in this is more dirty and raunchy compared to the smart, clever, and witty humour seen in Sarah Marshall. There are enough classic scenes in this film to make me want to go back and see it for a second, third or even fourth time. Get Him to the Greek pushes every envelope in the comedy world. From crazy sexual jokes to drug jokes, this movie has it all. What's hilarious though is that considering how raunchy the film is, there is a ton of heart as well. That is exactly how Judd Apatow films always work out. Now, Apatow did not direct the film but he was the main producer and it has his style all over it.<br/><br/>Sean ""Diddy"" Combs absolutely stole this movie. Every time he was on screen, he was pretty funny. I am sure it had a lot to do with the writing but his delivery was perfect. It was if he saw Dave Chappelle show episodes that made fun of him and he embraced that by using that to his advantage in this film. He was just as funny as the film's leading stars! In my opinion, Russell Brand and Jonah Hill need to make more movies together. Neither of them outshines the other. All of their jokes were perfectly balanced out and every time they were on screen, the jokes were flowing perfectly. This is one of those rare comedies that is consistently funny throughout the entire film. Though there seemed to be some downhill in the film toward the third act but it went back up again and caught back its funny sense. The film had many great moments but many awkward and weird moments. Overall it was a surprisingly funny film."

","This was another good movie by the amazing Jonah Hill. Well, Jonah Hill didn't really WRITE it but he had a funny character in this movie. Basically it was about how Jonah Hill and this English POP STAR buddy up in an effort to make it back to a concert in LA. I like Jonah Hill and how he has such a subtle sense of humor. Jonah Hill really made me laugh when he smoked that amazing joint. Without Jonah Hill this movie would have fallen flat. Puffy's character was really funny and he interacted with Jonah Hill in a funny way. Jonah Hill was constantly being bitched out by Puffy. That was funny when Jonah Hill looked at his cell phone and Puffy texted him that he was going to kill him :). So, if you want to laugh and are a fan of Jonah Hill I would suggest seeing this movie. Jonah Hill must have gained about 40 pounds for this. As if Jonah Hill wasn't already heavy enough."
"meeza","6","1","9","5 June 2010"," Greek is not the word! Even though at times it was diddy good.
","The sidesplitting and sharp comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is one flick I have not forgotten about. So I was all psyched on seeing ""Get Him to the Greek"" which is from the same director behind the Marshall plan; that being Nicholas Stoller. Well unfortunately it looks like Stoller has stolen 109 minutes from my existence, because ""Get Him to the Greek"" was an enormous disappointment. The Greek film stars Russell Brand as Aldous Snow of the band Infant Sorrow, who would be the same uproarious rock star character he played in a supporting role in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Also in the Greek starring show is Marshall alumni Jonah Hill portraying Aaron Green, a record company assistant who is given the challenging task of accompanying (or more like babysitting) the out-of-control Snow from London to Los Angeles' Greek Theater for a scheduled Infant Sorrow comeback concert. Ruckus follows consistently as a neurotic Aaron does his best to control the alcohol & drug induced Snow on the ride from London (with pit stops in New York & Las Vegas) to the Greek, but to no avail. Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs co-stars as the demanding record executive Sergio Roma who delegated the ""snowjob"" to Green. Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q., Snow's sexy pop star ex-girlfriend who shares a child with Snow, but now is Entering Sandman every night by mating with Lars Ulrich of Metallica. Elisabeth Moss also co-stars as Daphne, Green's longtime girlfriend who is more on the Daphne Duck side in the looks department. The movie does contain some gross-out comical scenes that provide a few chuckles but they wear out their welcome already during the film's second act. Brand was a riot in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but his branded ""highwire"" rock star personification is not fit to lead a film. Hill's tiresome bit as the starstruck but determined assistant Green also started growing weary early in getting to the Greek. However, I do not fault Brand and Hill completely. They both got a raw deal by Stoller getting them a muddled & disconnected screenplay. The one thing that really rocked in ""Get Him to the Greek"" was the scene-stealing performance from Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs as the self-centered but charismatic Roma. The movie worked when it was in Roma. To say that ""Get Him to the Greek"" is a forgettable movie is definitely not part of Greek Mythology, it is a fact! What a Greek tragedy! *** Average"
"the_Poppuns","9","1","14","4 June 2010"," Liked it but not what I expected
","Firstly, I love Russell Brand. Secondly, I have seen but pretty much hated My Favorite Year. I thought this was going to be the same thing. It is and then it isn't. It's not as much of a comedy to be honest. And they totally sell it as a comedy, which they do with all Apatow movies and I don't know why. Forgetting Sarah Marshall to me was barely a comedy because it's about a guy who is depressed the whole time. This isn't really that different. Just in this case it's a drug addict rock star who is pretty much headed on the road that many people have taken in recent years and ended up as a breaking news obit at the top of this website. It's another bromance as well, which is fine by me. All these movies are more sentimental than they'd have you believe in the trailers. I personally think that's detrimental to the movie because it makes people expect one thing and get another and then write on the internet how disappointed they are. Problem is, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie about the record industry and people and how they treat each other in such a ridiculous lifestyle with some funny bits thrown in.<br/><br/>I love Russell Brand and Jonah Hill together. I think they have the best chemistry. Their scenes together, pretty much the whole film, were more personal than funny. The more comedic parts usually happen when other people enter the mix. P. Diddy, for example, had a much larger role than I expected and he was okay in it. I probably would have cast an actor with more comedy experience, as well as choosing a different rock star cameo for Jackie Q's other love interest. But apart from that I really have no complaints. Perhaps I would have used more of Aldous' songs throughout the film, but that's because I quite like Brand's voice. I don't know that it was necessary for the plot.<br/><br/>Other stuff. It's an R for a reason. There's sex humor and drug stuff going on. There are some breasts but not much else in the nudity dept. that I can recall. I guess I'd recommend it for people like me who like English rock stars and comedies with warm fuzzies."

"TheMovieDiorama","4","0","1","1 September 2019"," Get Him To The Greek sings through its unfocused plot quicker than a Metallica song.
","The British eccentric behaviour of the leather-coated Brand and the American lifestyle of the fatigued Hill was an odd combination to say the least. Two types of humour that are regrettably polar opposites from each other. Explicit ""London, ennit"" expletives against monotonous lines of musically inclined dialogue unfortunately just doesn't work, further cementing the juxtaposing, unfocused and ill-fated tones that Stoller explored. Perhaps we shouldn't forget about Sarah Marshall after all. Tasked in bringing the rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theatre in LA, a wannabe music manager must adjust to the rock'n'roll lifestyle in just 72 hours.<br/><br/>I'm unable to score this highly for one simple reason. Depicting male sexual assault at the hands of a female for the sake of laughs is highly insensitive and just plain wrong. Imagine if the genders were swapped. It's not a joking matter, whatever the circumstance. Now that's out of the way, as mentioned before the two styles of humour failed to strum any guitars or bang any drums right from the offset, so the majority of laughs were diminished pretty early on.<br/><br/>The unlikely bromance between Hill and Brand failed to generate any electricity, just simply a means to showcase an onslaught of drugs, alcohol and sex to a peer pressured individual for the sake of his career. Brand was either too exhausting when conveying jokes or too unnaturally restrained to allow Hill to have his say, as if watching two different characters. And when rap titan P Diddy is funnier than the entirety of comedic actors, you just know something's not right (he was surprisingly effective). As was the rest of the supporting cast, including Byrne and Moss. The plot however held no substance, comprising of montages that showcased Hill's vomiting abilities. The tone bravely became darker in the conclusive third act, tackling depression and loneliness, yet it abruptly disrupted the characters and the ""humour"". Whilst I appreciate the exploration, it was far too thin to be anything but inconsistent.<br/><br/>Pretty much surmising the film. An inconsistent comedy that, whilst displayed talent from its supporting cast, predictably tarnished the lead characters by forcibly shoving the sentiment ""the rock'n'roll lifestyle isn't for everyone"" in our face and including a inconceivably sour sexual assault scene. By the end, you won't care if that make it to the Greek or not. All you will care about, is how Aldous thought ""African Child"" was a good idea..."

","""You're mouth is smiling,"" Russell Brand's has-been rock star Aldous Snow tells Jonah Hill's put-upon record company gopher Aaron Green, ""but your eyes look all sad."" This describes much of what makes Jonah Hill a likable comedic actor: just how vulnerable he can get in desperate situations, and eventually how sarcastic he remains through a tumultuous misadventure <br/><br/>It's too bad GET HIM TOO THE Greek has a title with much more urgency than the movie itself: The plot involving Green having to take Snow (green and snow how's that for symbolic?) from England to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, an outdoor venue where Snow will have a ten year reunion concert from the album that, like FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE, made him a sensation. The concert will also save Green's job and make his boss happy.<br/><br/>Creating a film about a fictional rock star (or band) is never easy since it's just as important to write tunes that would seem worthy enough for that person's fame to seem legit. With that in mind, Greek opens with a truly horrific song called ""African Child,"" a pretentiously liberal disaster making Snow a punchline in the music industry it's much easier writing a flop than a hit.<br/><br/>Russell Brand takes the easy road playing a womanizing smug jerk with a heart of gold, his character, a determined heroin addict seeking the next score in various stopover cities including New York and Las Vegas isn't very funny. And Jonah Hill's constant victim remains in sleep mode even through a breakup, various sexcapades and a heart-pounding overdose... Although it never really seems like Greek is trying to be hilarious – it's a breezy character study about two polar opposites remaining mellow no matter what the stakes are: they could have been on their way to McDonalds and it wouldn't have made a difference.<br/><br/>For anyone who has purchased L.A. Greek Theater tickets, you never want those seats that say ""Obstructed View,"" which means the stage is blocked by beams or girders, and with an overload of gratuitous sex and nudity there's a lot missing in this limp road movie. And yet, despite the abundant flaws, Brand and Hill have just enough chemistry (or anti-chemistry) keeps the movie watchable for a short ninety-minute ride."
"christophe92300","4","0","2","26 May 2013"," Didn't live up to the expectation
","Once again, we are dealing with a comedy that presented good potential but that ultimately disappoints.<br/><br/>Yet, Get Him To The Greek started off pretty well in a sustained rhythm with flying dialogues, gags, songs more absurd one from another and a crazy spirit that augured good things. Jonah Hill is excellent as always and proves once again he is probably one of the best comedians of his generation, but P. Diddy is particularly surprising because he managed very well.<br/><br/>But the more the movie progresses, the more it loses its comical aspect, the gags fall flat and become more and more rare, making room for very boring, satirical melodramatic episodes on the music industry and the life of an artist. In this sense, Get Him To The Greek probably would have worked better as a pure comedy, and shorten by 15 minutes to make it denser."

","... an amusing follow-up/spin-off to the okay ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", this one takes up one of the characters, unfettered by the former's poor shot continuity.<br/><br/>Amusingly free of a moral anchor, it does nevertheless get predictably mawkish in the last act, with the traditional ""mainstream Hollywood"" need for an epiphany/moral of the story. Yet Brand and Hill have an easy chemistry that carries it through, even if it's Puff Daddy that steals the film.<br/><br/>At nearly two hours it does stretch its limited concept to breaking point, and seems to have about fifty separate endings as a result, but this is a fun, engaging watch for entertainment purposes."

","I was cautious of this film. I'm not a brand fan, but thought he was excellent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. However, that was a smaller role. Now he's the star. Is Aldous Snow good enough to carry his own feature? Just about. The scriptwriters give him a bit more backstory, involving a failed marriage, and do eventually give an an emotional focus as a sad and lonely rock god. The film is also very funny, though this may have been aided by a bottle of wine. One scene had me laughing, uncontrollably, with tears streaming down my face. It involved Brand, Hill, Diddy and Colm Meaney, on drugs, screaming and a furry wall. The humour is broader than Marshall, with plenty of vomit, drug and sex gags. At almost two hours it is stretching its welcome, but I was very entertained."

I like movies that keep the audience entertained and interested in the characters, this movie has the same cycle over and over again where Aldus makes Aaron do stupid stuff and distracts him long enough for them to miss the airplane flights so Aldus can party some more each night.

","It was obvious to me that Aldous was messing with Aaron throughout the trip, beginning the very first day in England. Was Aaron so naive as to not see it himself? Or just star-struck? I'm 80 minutes into the movie and it's so unbelievable that Aaron just can't tell.<br/><br/>But my biggest objection is the language. Every major character has such a potty-mouth, it destroys the movie. <br/><br/>And the Sergio character is so sensitive about his race, he sees prejudice and bigotry everywhere, even when it's not there.

","I was sort of skeptic about this movie, not really sure what to expect of it. I thought it was going to be just another mediocre comedy that would be seen and then forgotten all about. But the movie took me by surprise.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Get Him to the Greek"" was actually a really good story, a story that I think we all can relate to on one level. Especially the message about being true to who you are and don't give up on your dreams and principles. And the way the story was presented and told was really good.<br/><br/>The cast in the movie was just amazing, especially Russell Brand in the role as Aldous Snow. He really nailed the role right on the head, and you really bought into his performance and his appeal as a rockstar riding on drugs and alcohol. And Jonah Hill, playing Aaron Green, also did a good job with his role. Now, personally, I am not one for musicians in movies, so I wasn't much fan of seeing Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs in the role of Sergio Roma.<br/><br/>I loved the partying scenes in the movie, because they were so nicely put together and filmed, especially with the way Aaron Green stood out and interacted with the drugs and alcohol. And I was laughing hard every time he threw up.<br/><br/>""Get Him to the Greek"" came as quite a surprise to me, and I am happy that I took time to sit down and watch it, because it really is much deeper than just your average comedy. And truth be told, I think this is one of Russell Brand's better movies."
"oneguyrambling","6","0","3","17 December 2010"," Amusing but underwhelming - relies too much on the personalities of the leads.
","It took a while but I eventually got around to watching this. (Thanks Hoyts discount offer!) Russell Brand was hardly the best thing about Forgetting Sarah Marshall a couple years ago, that film is a little underrated and had several memorable scenes and roles, not least of which was surprisingly Paul Rudd.<br/><br/>But Rusty was the guy though that did the most with his sudden emergence, since that time he has been a staple on the late night talk shows, continued releasing his stand up comedy DVDs despite the fact that they have no jokes and are basically him telling stories with his humorous cadence and patois, and managed to nab the music ""It-Girl"" of the moment Katy Perry. (Oh and Russell, as far as having a unique way of speaking, that worked for Pauly Shore. For a while.) Coupled with the fact that I believe Russell Brand to be quite a smart bloke (apart from the Katy Perry thing) and I hope he makes the most of his 15 minutes because he can be quite funny and often inspired to laugh inducing rambling rants, (my favourite type of rants by the way).<br/><br/>So rather than come up with a new vehicle to maximise Brand's ""brand"" they smartly stick with what got him there in the first place, the rock star Aldous Snow, lead singer of Infant Sorrow.<br/><br/>In Forgetting Sarah Marshall Aldous Snow was merely the guy who took Peter's titular missus. During the film Snow sang two songs and showed that he was capable of great rock star excess, but he rarely gave too much direct evidence of how capable.<br/><br/>In Get him to the Greek he gets his shot.<br/><br/>It is a few years on from the Hawaiian soujourn and Snow's high flying career is abruptly grounded. An ill conceived song and album both titled African Child is universally panned by critics and even his loyal fans, and his longstanding, similarly smutty missus Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) has ditched him, taking their son with her. Aldous has as a result fallen off the teetotalling wagon big time and is hoovering up everything he can push into an orifice.<br/><br/>Snow is left to revel in his own depression with only toadying henchmen and his Mum (with who he has a love/hate relationship) sticking around. For some reason, cinematic convenience perhaps? Snow travels sans entourage for the entire film.<br/><br/>Back in the States a low level music exec Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is sitting in a company brainstorming session, he floats the idea of Infant Sorrow reforming to play a 10 year anniversary gig in LA at the famed Greek theatre, the site of Snow's greatest success. Aaron's boss the Les Grossman rip-off named Sergio (Diddy... as in Diddy) is unimpressed, but looks into it. Imagine Aaron's surprise when Sergio returns days later to inform him that Snow has agreed to the gig, and that Aaron is to almost immediately set off to chaperone him to America for a promo TV appearance and the concert.<br/><br/>Aaron is a longtime devotee of Infant Sorrow's and heads home to tell his overworked missus Daphne of his success. Daphne is not a big music lover unfortunately, what with her career as a doctor taking shape and all, and after a brief argument they agree to break up.<br/><br/>So Aaron, simultaneously heartbroken and breathless with anticipation heads off to run his taxi-service. As with all major musical gigs apparently the planning and implementation of the entire proposal can be done in no time... Aaron has three days.<br/><br/>Look I could go through the next hour of the film describing misadventures and hijinks, we all know going in that this would be more ""Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'Roll"" than ""Wine, Women & Song"", and it is, that's why it is a bit odd that all the goings on left be more bemused than amused.<br/><br/>Sure Aldous gets himself in many a predicament with his spoiled ""I do what I want"" attitude, and manages to drag Aaron into most proceedings despite his weak protests, but the whole thing is more matter-of-fact than shocking or hilarious.<br/><br/>Missed flights, absinthe, casual groupie encounters and botched interviews all come and go, but the only scene that raised the eyebrows was when Aldous demands that Aaron hide his stash as they go through customs... join the dots from there kids.<br/><br/>Will Snow get to the gig? Will Aaron get back with Daphne? Will Diddy ever be anything less than a self-absorbed prat? I'd like to say that the whole thing was as I expected and feel pretty smug about myself that this wouldn't stand up well against the original film. Going in I thought there'd be some debauchery featuring drugs and women and hopefully more Brand than Hill, that all happened, but I did fully expect that this would make me laugh a lot more than it did.<br/><br/>All that and the fact that Diddy just can't make himself seem memorable, attention grabbing or as cool as he has always seemed to think he is, even when his role is practically written that way.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 6 / 10. Amusing at times, worth a look. Why do I feel strangely empty? Definitely a film I will revisit on DVD to see if I think differently next time round."

Russel Brand also makes another great performance by bringing back his character Aldous Snow who was also in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Jonah Hill however, yet he was funny he lacked in the field of jokes. All of the top jokes, go to P Diddy and Russel. I thought that he could be a little more funny.

"witster18","5","0","2","18 October 2010"," I wasn't necessarily disappointed, but this spin-off is average at best
","The film starts off funny and lays down some character development.<br/><br/>P-Diddy was one of the highlights of the film with his 'do-whatever-it-takes' role as a record label exec/ceo. You can tell that this was familiar territory for the anal-retentive-superstar who truly does act like he is above everything else in true life.<br/><br/>There are many funny moments in the first hour of this film, and most of those moments center around Aldous Snow(Russell Brand). From his ridiculous lyrics, to his falling-off the wagon, Snow really is the glue that keeps this together early. I was slightly disappointed in Jonah Hill's character. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Hill was completely convincing as an over-zealous Aldous Snow fan, but here his obsession with Snow and Infinite Sorrow is understated and under-developed. There could be an explanation for this. Aldous' latest album 'African Child' was an awful, critically bashed piece of junk that could turn away any music fan, but we still don't see the fanaticism from Hill that we expected coming out of 'Marshall'.<br/><br/>There is a major flaw with this film.<br/><br/>The relationship between Hill's character and his long-time girlfriend is shallow, and that shallowness really disintegrates the ending of the film. We're left to feel something for these two, and ultimately, Hill's character should have just kicked her to the curb.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes is painful to watch. The best thing about this film is the relationship between Hill and Brand. The film spends enough time showing us that their girlfriends are shallow and unlikable - so it makes no sense whatsoever when the film abandons the concentration on the friendship between Hill and Brand, in favor of rekindling the unlikable relationships with their girlfriends. We were having fun when they were single. We wanted to see Brand and Hill ride off into the sunset smoking a Jeffrey - instead we get back to what they both ran away from, terrible relationships with unlikable women.<br/><br/>Serious but also meaningless spoiler alert!!!! When the end of the film shows us that Hill followed his shallow girlfriend to Seattle - it completely undermines the entire film. Awful ending!<br/><br/>49/100<br/><br/>You'll MIGHT like it if you liked: I Love You Man, Bachelor Party 2, Weekend at Bernies, and The Great Outdoors."

","Get Him to the Greek is the hilarious spin off of an already funny Forgetting Sarah Marshall. In Greek we are re-united with the rock star Aldous Snow from the first film. However the once prominent rock star has taken a turn for the worse after his latest Single ""African Child"" (Trapped In Me) was labeled as racist and ""the worst thing to happen to Africa since AIDS"". Aldous then falls of his once pure ways and falls into his drug and women habits. Meanwhile in US Jonah Hill return to the series. Strangely though, he plays a different character than the one from the first film. He then receives the assignment of transporting the unstable Snow from England to a show at Los Angeles's Greek Theater. While not ground breaking in any way, this film is a crack-up throughout. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs stars as Hill's boss and steals the show. Who knew rap artists could be funny? Combs' one liners and text messages sent to Hill will keep you rolling with laughter the whole film. <br/><br/>The film also does a great job of keeping the viewers fully engaged and entertained at all moments. Whether it be the craziness or hilarity delivered by Brand, or the surprise of Combs' performance fans, are not to be disappointed. While in the theater I do not believe there was one quiet moment. Between the furry walls, or Snow's nasty drug addiction which leads to a gut-busting scene in the airport, there wasn't a quiet moment the whole time. The soundtrack is also a triumph in this film. Released on a CD before the release of the film, was the Infant Sorrow CD. Infant Sorrow is Snow's band and also acts as a soundtrack to the film. This was a creative and very appealing way to go after a soundtrack. The songs featured in the film are all memorable and have lines that will make you ask what you are listening to, and then laugh it off. Russell Brand who plays Snow leads on vocals on all the songs. <br/><br/>Greek acts as a perfect summer buddy comedy film. While not ground breaking on any levels Greek delivers big laughs minus very little pain (barring the hypocritical ending). IF films like Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Super Bad is a choice in your movie collection, then Greek is a must see. And with its soon to be released date or September 28th it's the perfect time to see this hilarious film."

","Drugs, bitches, rock stars, alcohol poisoning - geez! ""Get Him To The Greek"" is like one of my regular Tuesdays.<br/><br/>In this Judd Apatow-produced road movie, Aaron Green (Jonah Hill, looking like a grounded zeppelin) has three days to get British rock legend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, intensity of a charged defibrillator) from England to Los Angeles, for a 10th anniversary concert at the Greek Theater.<br/><br/>Sean Combs (or whatever his fad name is now: P-Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy, Diddy, Poffy, et al.) brings the pain as the record executive and self-proclaimed ""mindfucking expert"" Sergio, who orders Green to escort Aldous to the Greek, and then turns up mid-journey to stroke the furry walls with Green when Aldous slips him a Jeffrey.<br/><br/>You don't wanna know.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Nicholas Stoller, ""Get Him To The Greek"" is a delicious slice of rock and roll madness and simultaneously a vacation from the thinking part of your brain. The hedonism and gauche antics of Aldous may be drawn from rock star mythos, but the simplistic idea of a concert at the Greek Theater being staged three days from its inception is patently brainless.<br/><br/>Yet that is the ticking clock: get the rock star from England to America in three days for a gig which we just brainstormed yesterday; no need to call agents, licensing companies, production personnel or band members; no need for rehearsals, soundchecks, hiring gear; no need for contracts, negotiations, safety regulations; no need to even call the Greek Theater to see if they're booked - just plan the concert and everything magically falls into place. In this movie world, the hardest part about putting on a concert is having the artist actually appear, whereas in the real world, just negotiating the blue M&Ms on the rider is a three-week blood-letting ordeal.<br/><br/>Deliberately British Russell Brand (known to American audiences since FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, 2008, and his devilish standup special RUSSELL BRAND IN NEW YORK CITY, 2009) is fierce, a pacing animal, twitching and gyrating and lip-licking in low-slung trousers; Jonah Hill was the charging beast when he was let loose in SUPERBAD - here Brand pummels him with salacious energy; it's the exact relationship Aldous shares with Aaron Green - slipping him mickeys, loose women, injecting him with adrenaline, and eventually convincing Green to patch up his shaky relationship with his girl (Elisabeth Moss) by having a threesome with them.<br/><br/>Brand's performance reminds me of a quote from The New Yorker Apr 2007, Sasha Frere-Jones writing about Prince: ""When he simply cocked his head and smiled, it seemed like an act of public lewdness."" We are witnessing the launch of a superstar.<br/><br/>In FUNNY PEOPLE, plump Jonah Hill tells a slim Seth Rogen, ""You shouldn't have lost all that weight, man. There's nothing funny about a physically fit man."" But someone should warn Hill that the converse is also true. While Jack Black, Chris Farley, John Belushi and Fred Flintstone may be pulling laughs with their acceptable rotundity, Hill's girth in ""Get Him To The Greek"" is frankly disturbing, and a distraction to his comedic chops. As he approaches The Gabriel Inglesias he should remember that there's nothing funny about morbidly obese either.<br/><br/>Like every Apatow piece, ""Greek"" takes strange dark turns and creates sweet captured moments that seem all the more amazing for their randomness. After the banal, laugh-out-loud scene of Green shoving heroin up his bumhole to smuggle it onto a plane for Aldous, there is sudden silence in the audience when Aldous cusses out Green for destroying the heroin, demeaning Green for not understanding addiction and yet demeaning himself for being a slave to it. Scenes like this keep Apatow miles above the usual fare of lowbrow comedies that are his closest rivals, yet nowhere near him.<br/><br/>Though it's done in the spirit of irresponsibility, Aldous takes a detour to visit his dad (Colm Meaney), a musician in Vegas, and through their eternal bickering, there is a moment where we sneak up on them sharing a song together - and then get right back to bickering. Again - Judd Apatow, you maniac genius! <br/><br/>There are the formulaic moments, when we realize Aldous's arc involves reconciling with his girlfriend (Rose Byrne) who is sleeping with Lars Ulrich (playing himself), and that he necessarily must get off the drugs. Only by pleasing the craven hypocritical witchfynders who call themselves the MPAA will the film gain distribution; the beige activists at the Motion Picture Association of America literally blackmailing mediocrity into each and every American film release.<br/><br/>Creative direction, split-screening establishing shots, a thousand one-liners that you will miss from laughing so hard in the frenetic middle act with Diddy attacking everyone while stroking the furry walls. And whenever T-Rex's 20th Century Boy is launched onto a soundtrack, it takes any movie to another level.<br/><br/>Apatow has maintained ""Get Him To The Greek"" is anti-drug and anti-excess - but the message is lost somewhat when the coolest cats in the movie are having this much corrosive fun roaring, rogering, gorging and puking while on drugs, drink and dames. The message to some might just be: We should all be so lucky to try a little excess sometime.<br/><br/>Just drop by my place any given Tuesday."

","It is a bit annoying that I have seen this film before the predecessor Forgetting Sarah Marshall, also being the first I have seen with Russell Brand, but it doesn't matter too much. Basically Aaron Green (Superbad's Jonah Hill) is a low-level talent scout at Pinnacle Records, and he gives the idea to boss Sergio Roma (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs) to celebrate the ten year anniversary of a successful rock star's live performance. Aldous Snow (Brand) was a great rock star, and his live performance at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles was legendary, but after making the hated album 'African Child' he slipped down on the celebrity list and got into drugs and alcohol again. It is Aaron's job to get Aldous from his home in London to the Greek Theatre for the ten year anniversary performance, but that will not be easy with Aldous wanting to party and shag a lot. Aaron is relying on Aldous to stick to the scheduling to get his career back on track before the big event, but getting into the sex, drugs and parties himself, Aaron is in trouble himself. It is after the point of helping to smuggle drugs and believing he is split with his girlfriend that Aaron almost gives up on Aldous, but don't worry, he does get him to the Greek in the end, and everything else settles. Also starring Rose Byrne as Jackie Q, Elisabeth Moss as Daphne Binks, Kali Hawk as Chantal, Colm Meaney as Jonathan Snow,and cameos from Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lars Ulrich, Tom Felton and Kristen Bell as Sarah Marshall. I would have obviously loved to see Brand's debut in the predecessor before this follow up, but I am glad I saw the more critically liked film first. Brand is loud and rude quite a lot of the time, as he is in his British comedy work, and he shows a sensitive side too, and Hill makes a great character that suffers through all the rock star's lifestyle, they make a really good double act for this comedy that has some hilarious moments. Very good!"

","I was very excited about seeing this movie and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>A Russell Brand fan from way back, and a fan of Sarah Marshall, I was excited about this movie but was slightly concerned that my expectations would not be met, having been let down by sequels and spin-offs in the past. I am not a fan of many recent big budget comedies and was concerned that the charm of Forgetting Sarah Marshall would be missing from this film. Thankfully, GHTTG does not try to be another FSM, but stands independently as a hilarious and interesting movie.<br/><br/>The story flies by from one hilarious incident to the next and the resolutions of various comedic situations are largely unpredictable, which keeps the audience hooked. I found so many of the performances clever and the characters engaging that I did not want the movie to finish.<br/><br/>My only criticism about this film would be that I found it overly soppy and sentimental in some parts, something which makes me uncomfortable in movies that aren't meant to be taken too seriously.<br/><br/>But although the movie does not cause viewers to reflect on larger societal issues, (and is less successful the few times it does try this) as a light-hearted, entertaining film it is highly effective. Both times I saw this movie at the cinema the audience laughed hysterically at every joke from the start to the finish and this certainly helped my enjoyment. I am baffled as to why this film has received some less-than positive reviews."
"tjackson","9","0","2","6 July 2010"," Disgusting, hilarious, and sweet
","At its heart this is another Apatow late coming off age movie. Everyman officially has moved from Tom Hanks to Jonah Hill – I shudder to think what that means. But he's really good and convincing in the most random and insane situations. Most of those come from Russell Brand's rock star character Aldous Snow (is that Aldous Huxley meets Aurora Snow?) – part rock savant, part purveyor of petty musical porn. But he is amazing in the role. And Sean Combs is brilliant. He's so good you realize he can be completely ironic about his own mythology and powerful enough to stick it to the music business. As does the movie. It's pointed, unlikely, slapstick, disgusting, hilarious and sweet. And you never know where it's going to head next.A real bonus is the wonderful Elizabeth Moss (sooo good in Mad Men) as the unlikely girlfriend to Hill. The threesome attempted between these three characters in the bedroom says a lot about the clash of decades and generations. Brilliant and unrelenting."
"Troy_Campbell","6","0","2","2 July 2010"," Constant chuckling and the occasional belly laugh are on offer.
","Russell Brand is charismatic. No two ways about it. He oozes an effortless charm that sucks you in whether you like it or not. Which is lucky, because his Aldous Snow is completely unlikeable for the most part and is only palatable thanks to Brand's aforementioned qualities. His nonchalant approach towards what other people think and his egotistical attitude – in real life that is – suits the portrayal of a rock star perfectly, to the extent that it's extremely difficult to ascertain whether this is life imitating art or vice-versa, such are the similarities between actor and character.<br/><br/>However for Brand's ying there is Jonah Hill's yang. Polar opposites in just about every way, Hill provides the ideal counterbalance to the brash British comedian. He is subdued, straight-faced and subtle – the adrenaline shot sequence being an exception – but just as funny, if not more. Where Brand relies on outspoken brazenness for laughs, the chubby American elicits humour with measured wit and authentic comic timing, as evidenced by his superb comebacks throughout the film.<br/><br/>With the brilliant chemistry between its differing leads and the surprisingly terrific support by the usually dramatic co-stars – Combs is hilarious whilst Byrne and Meaney are in roles you would never expect to see them in – you would think GHTTG is a sure-fire hit, and it looks that way for the first 75 minutes. Unfortunately it begins to fall to pieces come the final act when writer-director Stoller opts to take a serious route and deliver a clichéd moral point rather than sticking with the unabashed entertainment of the first two acts. This serious misstep in tone finishes the movie on a low and undoes some of the good work that proceeded it, though not enough to dampen the overall experience.<br/><br/>Constant chuckling and the occasional belly laugh are on offer in this solid, if ultimately forgettable, comedy.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

"Jules45","6","0","2","30 June 2010"," Get me to the greatness of the Greek - Again!
","After 2008's quirky romcom Forgetting Sarah Marshall – arguably that years' best giggle wiggle, I was surprised to see that there was going to be a sequel, even if it was indirect, because: a) Sequels rarely work and b) Why ruin what was so enjoyable about the first? It's like if they did 'The 50 Year Old Virgin', it would completely make people reluctant to ever watch Steve Carell again, though Evan Almighty did a good enough job of that.<br/><br/>But here in all its Russell Brandness is a sequel that almost is as good as the first. Hallelujah! This time round instead of Jason Segel being our leading lad, its Russell Brand playing a British rock version of himself, who is being taken from London to L.A. within 72 hours via Aaron Green (Jonah Hill). This however is apparently considered an impossibility and after seeing 0.25 seconds of Aldous Snow, it isn't hard to see why.<br/><br/>If you hate Russell Brand this really isn't for you (Duh?). Everything from his Edward Scissor Hands hairdo to his teenage libido is at an all-time high for 99% of the film, the other 1% being the credits. Hence it is unsurprising why many consider this the visual/audio version of his 'My Booky Wook'. Personally I love dear Russell, to the point of wanting to dip him in my coffee and put sprinkles all over his head.<br/><br/>Russell along with Jonah Hill and P.Diddy make a threesome that is a delightfully humorous combination, like a modern day 'Apatow' version of the three wise men. On the topic of threesomes, that word will never have the same pleasurable meaning again after seeing Get Him to the Greek - just stay away from a horny Jonah Hill, that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>Out of all the whole grain goodness of the film - sorry about that, I forgot it wasn't a cereal, the Las Vegas scene is quite easily the most funny. It has the kind of mayhem you'd expect to have happened during the drunkenness of The Hangover. There is also a scene within that of an adrenaline shot which compared to the heart stopping nervousness of Pulp Fictions' certainly isn't the counterpart.<br/><br/>Admittedly Forgetting Sarah Marshall is marginally funnier, but that doesn't mean if there was a threequel I would at all be hesitant to watch it. My bets on it being Kristen Bell and her cheesy in-film television shows – but I'd much rather have them call it a day than risk another spin-off."

","First off I'm not a massive Russell Brand fan, he has his moments but to give him credit he does a great job in Get Him To The Greek.<br/><br/>The film starts off a little slow but it soon picks up and keeps it pace very well. Dishing out comedic moments by the bucket load, but balances it well with a bit of drama (Which I wasn't sure that Brand could pull off!!...and I stand corrected)<br/><br/>There were a few moments that I thought should have been cut out or at least expanded on (the whole wife thing) but it didn't bring the film down at all. It added a sense of drama, but I'm not a big drama fan lol<br/><br/>Brand, Diddy and Hill are a great comedic combination...(True Diddy can't act for sh*t but still)<br/><br/>I'd recommend this for sure, probably one for the 16 - 30's, not a lot of people can handle puke on the big screen =P<br/><br/>Some people are moaning that this film was a little crude, that it wasn't funny, that it's ridiculous that a fat guy gets girls??...it's like they've watched a completely different film to everyone else! They probably thought the twilight series is good...anyway...ignore them and make your own decision!<br/><br/>FYI - Blade is the only vampire film you need to watch...vampires glowing? bah lol"

","Going into this movie I was expecting a fun comedy movie, Russell Brand was going to be the stand out cast member and there was going to be tons of swearing and sexual innuendo. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>If you are after the above then go see this movie but be warned, this is not all about laughs. I had spoken to a friend who saw this before me who told me that she was quite concerned with the over the top drug use portrayed in the movie. For me this didn't concern me in the slightest as in some of the scenes it really did enhance the comedy.<br/><br/>The problem is that the writers of the script tried very hard to push an anti-drug message throughout the movie, for which I have massive respect. The problem was the timing of the delivery of this message. In a lot of scenes you have just wet yourself laughing (at drug use), to be promptly smacked in the face with the anti-drug message.<br/><br/>This left me feeling a little guilty for laughing to be honest.<br/><br/>Mind you, I haven't laughed this hard in the cinema since I saw The Hangover so it wasn't doing many things wrong.<br/><br/>Despite all of this I would suggest waiting for the DVD."
"cbolton121","7","0","2","25 June 2010"," Some cheap (but big) laughs
","The first and most important thing about this film is you cannot go into it expecting the world. If you hope for a groundbreaking new comedy to top all others then this isn't for you. However, if you wish to see Brand and Hill at their best in addictive relationship with some genuinely funny scenes, then this is your film! I must offer a word of caution though, if you are easily offended in any way then you may find this... distasteful shall we say. Watch it with a light heart and an open mind and you will find this all part of the charm though and you will find yourself watching a very respectable and amusing comedy, it will not be a disappointment."

","Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) works for a record company and is tasked with getting hard living but has-been rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, playing the character first seen in Forgetting Sarah Marshall) from London to Los Angeles in time for a comeback concert, despite Snow's concentrated efforts to indulge in sex and drug fuelled rock'n'roll chaos instead.<br/><br/>As a Daily Mail reader of mature years I hate Russell Brand, of course, and I deplore the vast amount of recreational drug use and the constant bad language in this movie, of course, and I have hated Jonah Hill ever since I first loathed the character he played in Superbad. So there was no way I was going to enjoy this movie. Of course. How could I? <br/><br/>Thing is, this is a very funny movie. The humour ranges widely from character based, to verbal, to situational (and, yes, to unmentionable body parts, sexual matters and drugs) and is often laugh out loud funny. The mostly young audience I watched with laughed a lot, and so did I. Brand is a very talented man - he sings well, has an engaging screen presence, and knows how to use his face and body to excellent dramatic and comedic effect. I even warmed to Jonah Hill, playing a much more sympathetic character than usual. And Rose Byrne, usually so serious, was an absolute revelation, playing Snow's gorgeous (and more successful) ex, Jackie Q, with earthy and very funny gusto, and an occasionally dodgy gawd luv us cockerny accent.<br/><br/>The music is quite good, too, being peppered with songs in the same vein as Snow's videos in Sarah Marshall, ie. effective and enjoyable spoofs of their particular genres, with lyrics which are just overstated enough to be effective parodies of something which you would often think couldn't be parodied.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film a LOT more than I expected to."

","I cannot stand Jonah Hill. A friend asked me to see this with her, and I went thinking I might get a laugh or two out of Russel Brand. I was dreading having to watch Hill on screen for so long.<br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>I did not stop laughing. From the second Brand appeared on screen, the cinema was full of giggles and bursts of laughter. Anyone who has read Brand's book will notice a few home truths with him and his character. That being said, he was completely believable. Hill was surprisingly likable, Rose Byrne was amazing as always, and P.Diddy shockingly good. I think the fusion of American/British humour was played brilliantly. I hated the Hangover, LOVED this and am planning on seeing it again and again."

Which makes this easier to watch with family or relatives.<br/><br/>One thing I found though, was that many scenes that were in the trailer/s aren't in the actual film.<br/><br/>Overall, if your looking for a good time (and if you loved ""Superbad""), check out ""Get him to the Greek."""

","Don't you remember those days when you'd hear your favorite singer on the radio, and would think ""I want to work for him!""? Then as you older, find out the easy way (that is, by reading the news and such) that it's not such a glamorous life after all? Well, unfortunately, Aaron Green, a Record Company assistant who is a big fan of Alodus ""Infant Sorrow"" Snow, has to find it out the hard way... that is, actually work for him. And so begins the hilarious spin off of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"".<br/><br/>Aaron Green is working for a dying record company. His manager Sergio, played in a hilarious performance from P. Diddy, needs ideas quick. However, Aaron comes up with one quick idea: the 10th anniversary of Infant Sorrow's legendary show at the Greek in Los Angeles is coming up, and the perfect way to celebrate is to have an anniversary concert at the exact venue. Sergio approves of the deal, so he is given three days to fly to London, get Alodus Snow to New York City for an interview and performance on ""The Today Show"", then back to Los Angeles for the concert. So it sounds simple, right? Actually, wrong. The moment Green meets Snow in London, a nightmare begins. Snow is a drugged out and alcoholic man who lives with his mom after his breakup with female pop sensation Jackie Q and the flop (and mass criticism of his apparently horrible record ""African Child"", oft regarded ""The worst thing to happen to Africa since Apartheid"". Crazy parties including absinthe consumption, ugly sex, and unexpected detours begin. Just pray to god that they'll get to Los Angeles on time, okay? Now enough of the babbling about the plot, let's get to the bottom of it. Personally, I enjoyed the movie. I mean, I knew what it was gonna be- a rude and crude comedy from Apatow. His movies are often that, and this is no different. The movie has excellent performances from Russell Brand and P. Diddy, and especially a different direction for Jona Hill. There's plenty of gags and laughs, plenty of grossout moments and WTF scenes.<br/><br/>However, there's something missing from the movie I can't seem to find. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because of the fact that some scenes, including the ""Jeffery"" scene, go on for too long, and as a result, beat the audience to death with the joke because they feel that the audience isn't laughing, its almost Stoller's way of saying ""laugh, dammit, laugh!"". Also, I found some scenes to be a bit too dark (granted I love dark things). About 10 minutes before the concert, some scenes are just downright depressing. Not to mention the heroin scene at the Vegas hotel. Also, the movie is a tad too long, and at least 10 minutes could have been removed.<br/><br/>In short, it's good laugh fare if you just want a nice little comedy with crude jokes and Brand, but just don't expect too much. I personally find Forgetting Sarah Marshall to be a lot better."
"michaeloreper","9","0","3","10 June 2010"," Very funny but also a heartbreaking story of celebrity madness.
","Yesterday I enjoyed a showing of ""get him to the Greek"" starring Russel Brand, Jonah Hill, and a breakout performance by Sean ""puffy"" Combs. Brand plays the part of washed up and drugged out international rock superstar Aldous Snow to perfection, seemingly drawing fro his own experience on the gritty streets and shady bathroom stalls of Great Britain where the comedian-cum-actor spent his younger days as a VJ for MTV's Heathrow office, where he allegedly got canned for introducing Kylie Minogue to his dealer. Jonah Hill delivers an equally poignant performance as Snow's weekend chaperone proving the Apatowian comedy formula holds strong and that a Keanu Reeves type leading man is not an integral part of producing a blockbuster. Sean Combs perhaps played the most hilarious role in the film as intense studio head ""Sergio"", and was responsible for many of the most memorable lines of the film, giving a performance described by Brand to be ""his comedy equal"". Though this film was laugh out loud funny throughout, it also effectively conveyed the surreal sadness and loneliness that celebrity life affords. Brand's personal take on the subject matter was obvious throughout and allowed for a realistic, though heartbreaking take on celebrity, drug use and the inevitable eventual descent into madness. This film was quite good and I recommend it, however the subject matter is not for the consumption of children."
"EUyeshima","7","0","4","7 June 2010"," An Unexpected Comic Pairing Brings Laughs and Surprising Resonance to an Apatow Factory Farce
","There are moments that are laugh-out-loud riotous and there are others that are purely head-scratching, but the net effect of this raunchy, often clever 2010 anti-buddy comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller is genuinely positive. This is his second feature after 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which served as the introduction to Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, a sexed-up, heroin-abusing, non-sequitur-spouting British rock star. In this screenplay co-written by Stoller and Jason Segel (who also co-wrote and starred in ""Sarah Marshall""), Aldous has been on the skids since the release of a publicly reviled album called ""African Child"" - denounced as the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid.<br/><br/>What's worse is that Spice Girls-inspired pop star Jackie Q, his longtime girlfriend and mother of his child Naples, has left him for Lars Ulrich, the longtime drummer for Metallica. Meanwhile, Sergio Roma, a megalomaniacal label executive, is about to release Aldous from his contract when puppyish young staffer Aaron Green comes up with the high-risk idea of a comeback concert in LA, marking the 10th anniversary of Aldous' landmark show at the Greek Theater. The rest of the story is a ""Hangover""-type road movie of sorts between Aaron and Aldous, as Aaron has to fetch the rock star in London and get him to LA in time for the concert three days away. Predictably, nothing goes as planned as Aaron, in the throes of a sudden break-up with his overworked hospital intern girlfriend Daphne, gets seduced by Aldous' narcissistic excesses.<br/><br/>What becomes less predictable is how Stoller and Segel choose to deepen Aldous enough to give the character a sense of introspection about his besotted life, including a side trip to Vegas where he reunites with his estranged father, a guitarist for a Rat Pack tribute show who is jealous of his son's success. At the same time, Roma is in hot pursuit to make sure Aaron does his job, and everyone gets involved in a drug-fueled mêlée that should serve as the definitive anti-drug commercial. Brand completely stole ""Sarah Marshall"" from his cast mates, including Kirsten Bell, who played the title role and shows up in an unexpected cameo. Given this is a vehicle for his character, he manages to show more dimension to Aldous without losing sight of his hilarious comic creation (his opening video is hysterically tasteless). In a comparatively more constrained role, Jonah Hill manages to be regular-guy funny and brings surprising heart to put-upon Aaron.<br/><br/>Together Brand and Hill convey a convincing sense of trust between the characters despite their opposite tendencies. On the sidelines, Rose Byrne shows real comic chops as the uninhibited Jackie Q, while Elisabeth Moss of ""Mad Men"" makes Daphne far more than the wet rag she is set up to be in the story. Colm Meaney effectively plays Aldous' embittered father during the film's most serious scene, while Sean Combs is quite funny - in a good way - as Roma. It should come as no surprise that this whole venture was produced by Judd Apatow since his fingerprints are everywhere given all the comic and often crass male bonding throughout. Stoller's uneven direction explains the fluctuating variations in the movie's tone, and like every Apatow movie, the film runs about twenty minutes too long for the slight story being told. Brand and Hill, however, make an engaging duo no matter what."
