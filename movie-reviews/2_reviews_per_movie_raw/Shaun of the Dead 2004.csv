"Gafke","10","284","340","5 June 2004"," Bloody Brilliant! Literally!
","""Shaun of the Dead"" is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time, it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time, PERIOD! Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) isn't having a very good week. His co-workers have no respect for him, his uptight stepfather is on his back and his beloved girlfriend Liz has had enough of his laziness and inconsideration. Really, Shaun isn't such a bad guy, but he has no ambition and seems to prefer the company of his unemployed, flatulent, video-game obsessed slob of a flatmate Ed to anyone else. And as if this were not enough, the dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain. Not even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world. When Shaun and Ed finally do realize what is happening, it quickly becomes a race against time: save Shaun's mum, rescue Liz and go to the pub where they can wait out the zombie infestation with a pint and a smoke. <br/><br/>Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with, ""bitey"" zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments. But Shaun, armed with a cricket bat, is determined to save the woman he loves and nothing is going to get in his way!<br/><br/>This film should be seen side by side with Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as both films cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombified society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. There's not much gore here, but there is one very unexpected and Savini-worthy moment in ""Shaun"" when the zombies rip a living man to shreds, yanking out intestines and tearing off limbs. I really hadn't seen such a gory scene coming and was too stunned to look away. It's truly graphic and nauseating...and, though I usually hate gore, very well done. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in ""Shaun."" There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean stepdad. Shaun himself is forced to grow up and take charge as the zombies close in around them. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away the incredible ending of ""Shaun"" except to say that the living dead are not immune from pop-culture commercialization, and though loved ones may die, video games are forever. <br/><br/>SEE THIS FILM!!! You do NOT have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate the sublime satire that is ""Shaun of the Dead."" I haven't seen a movie this good for a very long time. 10 stars."
"Damian_Piesse","10","348","441","17 April 2004"," Instant cult status.
","Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, both the joint writer and the main star of the film, has been a comedic force for some time, most notably in the fantastic BBC2 series 'Hippies' (which inexplicably bombed in the ratings) and the cult Channel 4 series 'Spaced'.  Both programs hinted at Pegg's saliently dead pan comedic manner (and writing skills) which comes to full fruition in 'Shaun of the Dead'.<br/><br/>In a nut shell, this film is a romantic comedy with zombies (or zom-rom-com) who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered).  The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant.<br/><br/>Pegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film.  And not in the 'American' form of: 'I am a loser but I work in TV and have Jennifer Aniston as my wife'  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as 'Bruce Almighty' or dozens of other US 'loser' films.  Pegg's Shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too, he's an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing - and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film.  There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop.  The first time Shaun plods semi-comatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser.  However, by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on!  The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! Not that this film is subtle however, there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles `28 days later' - see if you can spot it!<br/><br/>The only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film.  All I can say is that I cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laugh-out-loud moments. It was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that I can never watch this film for the first time ever again - every viewing will forever be a repeat viewing.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is not very everyone though - the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film (in the UK). This film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films. It will also be enjoyed by teenagers (who filled the cinema when I viewed this film which was terrific, as they laughed loudest).  Finally, I do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie.  Black Book's (channel four) star Dylan Moran seemed a bit wasted and so was Martin Freeman (from BBC2's The Office) - who would have made a terrific zombie!  Also, did I spot Matt Lucas (from BBC3's 'Little Britain') in this film? I am not sure as I was laughing too hard maybe!<br/><br/>
These problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven.  My suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give Simon Pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the UK papers have suggested as his next project - `From Dusk 'Till Shaun'."
"erolsab","Null","243","308","16 April 2004"," You'll laugh till it hurts!
","Shaun Of The Dead isn't your typical zombie movie. In fact, the zombies don't truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in. So what's it really about? A man named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.<br/><br/>Don't let the title and premise fool you, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead, it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the undead. The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout. The jokes that stem from this are absolutely hilarious but will probably be lost on any non-Londoners. It's actually quite unlikely that this film will translate to anyone outside the UK and this is a real shame and perhaps the films biggest flaw. But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here. The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. The humour comes thick and fast, never have I laughed so consistantly during any film before, it only pauses briefly for a few dramatic scenes, all of which work surprisingly well. In fact the film tends to genre-hop quite a lot, and while some find this unappealing I think it works in its favour. One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror. In fact some scenes are quite jumpy and certainly violent. One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you. That's the thing about this movie though, you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. Can I explain it? Well, no. You'll just know if the film's for you when you see it. I can assure you that most will like it. If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill . Ok, that wasn't long ago, but before that I don't think there was a film that was so rip-roaringly funny and then unashamedly brutal at the same time. There is nothing subtle about this movie, and yet it will simply go over the heads of most people. I urge you to watch the film and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it. It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead is a great film. It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it! Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve. Go watch it, you'll laugh till it hurts!"
"colettesplace","9","292","373","17 December 2004"," The best rom zom com ever! A loving satire with lots of British humour.
","Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this quintessentially British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) to realise anything's wrong is priceless. Director Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the film with Pegg, also demonstrates that there's little difference between glassy eyed commuters and their undead brethren.<br/><br/>The plot rips along beautifully and parodies both the romantic comedy and zombie genres, while at the same time remaining true to them. Hopefully a new genre, the romzom com, has been born  incidentally, that's where you can go to find out more about the movie  romzom.com. The fabulous supporting cast includes Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as Shaun's supercilious stepfather, Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls) as Shaun's absent-minded mum, Dylan Moran (Black Books) as Liz's snooty housemate David and Lucy Davis (The Office) as wannabe actress Diane.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead was partially inspired by the classic zombie flick, Dawn of the Dead. Its creator George Romero was reportedly so impressed with Shaun of the Dead that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are taking on cameo roles in Romero's latest instalment, Land of the Dead.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is one of the best comedy of 2004 and a must-see for all rom zom com (romantic comedy with zombies) afficionados. ****½/***** stars."
"dee.reid","10","182","236","26 September 2004"," When there is no more room in hell, Shaun will walk the earth and...
","...He'll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""<br/><br/>Armed with a cricket bat, razor-sharp wit, and an attitude, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is perhaps the last guy that you'd want to save the world from the legions of the living dead that have suddenly begun to storm the London neighborhood where he lives. It could be stated, as this is a running gag here, that we're all dying slow deaths, so it's no surprise that when zombies begin to eat the flesh of the living, Shaun couldn't be any more oblivious to the chaos that has gripped most of London.<br/><br/>Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.<br/><br/>While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.<br/><br/>Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.<br/><br/>You may remember the character of ""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that ""SOTD"" was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action-mayhem ""Dawn of the Dead"") and 2002's ""28 Days Later"" (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Granted ""Shaun of the Dead"" is aimed largely at the gorehounds who idolized Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy, but it's also the first zombie flick to attempt making a hit with the mainstream. I guarantee any viewers out there that you'll spend more time laughing than you will being frightened.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Grigory_the_Wanderer","10","241","329","7 October 2004"," The best comedy of the year!
","Here in the States they don't show too many foreign movies, even if they are from the countries like UK. When they show them, however, they tend to outdo some of the American movies in the box office. Although the British movies are rarely shown here, they're a guaranteed success - do you recall the popularity of the last year's ""28 Days Later""? Well, this movie is even better - it's a hilarious combination of comedy, social parody, tragedy and drama, spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. Some references are pretty slim, though - for example ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" is a reference to ""The Night of the Living Dead"" - a reference that many people (including George Romero!) didn't get. Most of the actors are unknown to an average American, yet they played great! I hope that movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" will make big wigs in Hollywood realize that there are many great foreign movies, and that integrity is always better than crude remakes which the States are so notorious for... I encourage everybody to come and see SOTD - the best comedy of 2004."
"BrandtSponseller","10","106","144","12 February 2005"," May be the best comedy-horror mix of recent years
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) is in the midst of a lousy patch--he hates and is embarrassed about his job, he gets no respect from other employees, one of his roommates is on his case about the other roommate--a slacker friend of Shaun's, his girlfriend is on his case about the fact that all the ever do is hang out at a pub, and he hates his stepfather, who is also on his case about doing something nice for his mum. As if that's not bad enough, suddenly, everyone is turning into a zombie. Shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same time.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is a superb blending of horror and comedy ala An American Werewolf in London (1981), Idle Hands (1999), Frankenhooker (1990), or the Evil Dead films (beginning with the 1981 original, although there is progressively less to more comedy in that series). It manages to successfully both pay homage to and spoof a number of classic zombie films and horror film zombie mythology in general.<br/><br/>The film begins firmly in very British comedy/drama territory, with a number of stylistic directorial flourishes that seem like a cross between Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting (1996). The horror material enters gradually, beginning with a couple background gags, then entering Desolation Boulevard territory via another Boyle reference, this time to 28 Days Later (2002) (although that itself was basically a version of The Last Man on Earth (aka L'Ultimo uomo della Terra)(1964), based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend). This arrives in the guise of Shaun crossing over to the corner store to buy his morning soda. He doesn't notice the deserted streets or store because he's so hung over from the night before.<br/><br/>Before long, our ragtag bunch of heroes is in the midst of a full-fledged zombie apocalypse--of the traditional, slow-moving zombie type. Acknowledging the cultural differences that strict gun laws bring about, they have to use their wits to commit the requisite head busting, enlisting unwanted LPs (after some debate over the merits of each), cricket bats, shovels and other items for the job. Of course it would be easier if any of our heroes were the slightest bit athletic and had any aim, but they get the job done. More or less.<br/><br/>Furthering genre-fan fun, director/writer Edgar Wright and co-writer Pegg insert a lot of references to other zombie films--especially when it comes to explaining the source of the ""epidemic"". The ""scientific"" explanations given in Resident Evil (2002), 28 Days Later, all of Romero's Dead films--beginning with Night of the Living Dead (1968)--and possibly even Romero's The Crazies (1973) and then some are all mentioned in the background, but resolutely cut off before they're finished. Part of the reason might be that usually, the explanations were pretty ridiculous, and we didn't really care--we just wanted to get to the cool zombie stuff, such as limbs being torn off, guts being eaten, and brains being blown or smashed out of skulls.<br/><br/>Wright and Pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films. Shaun looks and walks like a zombie when he's waking up. We see zombie like office workers, retail workers, and so on. There's also an amusing nod to filmic attempts to study and tame zombies, as well as organized militaristic defenses (both very prominent in 28 Days Later, but present in other films as well). There are interesting, more subtle and original zombie subtexts in Shaun of the Dead, also, such as the ""mirrored"" scene where Shaun and his crew meet up with Yvonne and her crew.<br/><br/>As long as you like outrageous comedy, somewhat gory horror, and you don't mind mixing the two, Shaun of the Dead should provide an enjoyable ride. Although it is the most fun when you're very familiar with the source material it is spoofing and referencing, it is still a great comedy-horror film if viewed with fresher eyes, and not so much as a spoof."
"meako1973","10","145","206","3 April 2004"," Like Spaced...with zombies
","In a London suburbia, Shawn is almost 30 and hasn't really achieved much in his life. He comes home from his mundane job each day, and goes to the same pub (The Winchester) that he always has gone to. He shares his flat with an ex-student friend, and his lifelong slob of a friend. On top of that, his girlfriend has had enough of him. Oh.and the dead have started walking the earth!<br/><br/>Hot on the heels of recent remake Dawn of the Dead comes Simon 'Spaced' Pegg's black comedy zombie spoof, in which Shawn must save his friends, mum, and ex-girlfriend from the masses of lumbering dead by, erm, going to the Winchester! Unlike recent zombie-fests, these dead-ites are pretty lame, lumbering monstrosities, much like the ones from the older zombie films. This is used to simple comic effect throughout as the 'heroes' seem to have plenty of time to think about things before being attacked.<br/><br/>The film balances the humour excellently with a decent zombie-story, and the array of characters within are not there just for laughs, there are plenty of poignant moments scattered throughout. Issues of family, love, and friendship, along with growing older and accepting responsibility are contained within the script. Much in the way that TV series Spaced managed to play the absurd with the serious, so does this film. It is easy to compare it to a 'big screen Spaced' episode, but that doesn't sell the film enough. It is much more than that, and is the perfect homage to zombie flicks, and social satire too. Watch towards the early stages of the film to see that most of the population could be confused for zombies anyway, and as for the end scenes of the film.well.suffice to say it will keep you laughing right to the end.<br/><br/>With a cast pulled from many cult British shows (Dylan Moran from Black Books, Matt Lucas from Little Britain, and nearly everyone from Spaced), and an excellent appearance by Bill `Love Actually' Nighy, there isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks.<br/><br/>This is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. The only drawback is that if it catapults him to international stardom he may never get around to making that final season of Spaced!!"
"tjcclarke","Null","122","178","15 April 2004"," Flesh-eating fun for all the family
","The great British sit-com has undergone something of a revival in recent years. Galvanised by the new wave of smart, sassy imports from the US, the Brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland, identikit dross of the late eighties and early nineties.<br/><br/>One such series is Spaced, a wholly original and delightfully quirky comic bagatelle which has built up a small but dedicated following in the UK. Now writer/actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright have teamed up once again to give us Shaun of the Dead which is, in a nutshell, a feature-length episode of Spaced (with added zombies). Happily timed to coincide with the Hollywood remake of the 1978 classic shocker Dawn of the Dead, Shaun is the perfect antidote: Irreverent, warm and very funny.<br/><br/>Shaun (Pegg) is your stereotypical sit-com loser: An ineffectual slob in a dead-end job, he is terminally afraid of commitment and spends all his time with his flat-mate Ed (Nick Frost, also from Spaced) who is an even bigger loser. After his girlfriend dumps him, Shaun and Ed seek solace in their local pub the Winchester - a good old-fashioned English hostelry with warm beer and pork scratchings which is infamous for its lock-ins. They stagger home in a state of advanced refreshment, unaware that the dead are now walking the earth. Indeed, it takes Shaun a little while to work it out the following morning despite interacting with a few of them (one of the recurring themes is that most of us go through the drudgery of our daily routines in a trance close to inertia).<br/><br/>When the penny drops, Shaun resolves to rescue his mother and his (ex) girlfriend and generally stand up for himself for the first time in his life. There is not much more of a plot than that. The film, like Spaced relies on a flawless script, observational humour and the theatre of the absurd. Pegg has perfected this in his writing but he is also a surprisingly good actor. It helps that he has surrounded himself with the pick of the British comedy fraternity who seem to have been lining up (literally in one scene) for a cameo. The stars of similarly acclaimed series' such as Black Books, The Office and Little Britain are all on show here as well as Jessica Stevenson, Pegg's Spaced co-writer, who plays a jolly-hockey-sticks human vigilante with a stiff-upper lip and can-do attitude ready to give those nasty zombie's what-for.<br/><br/>Veteran support comes from Penelope Wilton (a sit-com stalwart from a bygone age) as Shaun's curtain-twitching mother and Bill Nighy as her fearsome second husband who performs one of the most dignified and poignant descents into zombieness ever caught on camera.<br/><br/>Despite all the high praise, it must be acknowledged that Shaun of the Dead is still a spoof - a comic tool that you could argue is as low a form of wit as sarcasm. But where it scores highly is in its respect for the original material. Most spoofs (the Scary Movie franchise, for example) are vicious lampoons that unmercifully mock the films they are taking off. Shaun of the Dead gently pokes fun but doesn't lose sight of the fact that if something is worth parodying, it must have some merit. Pegg is also careful to ensure that his film can stand up on its own - there is barely a minute goes by without a very good joke and despite the light-heartedness, there are some satisfyingly scary moments and ample gore.<br/><br/>What is most encouraging is that us Brits have started playing to our strengths. It took a long time for comedy writers to realise that making an English version of Friends is doomed to failure (in the same way that The Office will not work with an American make-over). We should celebrate the Britishness of this film, laugh knowingly at the in gags, and be proud that it doesn't take a huge budget or movie stars to entertain people at the cinema.<br/><br/>8/10"

Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is really good looking. Its not like many other British movies and has a good looking use of cinematography and lighting. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks.<br/><br/>You might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) but its really more than that. The movie is good and creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof. All of the characters are well written and are funny in their own way.<br/><br/>The acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's.

Massively overlooked at the time of broadcast yet with a hardcore fan base of loyal devotees a third series was long overdue but never did materialise.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is the continuation of what went before; of a similar format yet in a completely new setting, with new characters, plus new cast members and for the first time a feature-length run time for the big screen. So how does it play out? Even with such a departure from the original setting, the history of TV to cinema adaptations is a dodgy one to say the least. Fortunately for those of us who already fans or (more likely) if you've never seen the series before prepare to be impressed.<br/><br/>The style is all it's own. With inventive direction and editing making the visual impact which fans will instantly recognise, to the writing which importantly is firstly genuinely funny, interspersed with references to popular culture of the past two decades, always with a self-knowing grin, a wink to the viewer rather than a pretentious nod. And of course several self-references and in-jokes of the TV series all fill in the gaps between the tastefully presented killings. There is blood, after all this is a ""rom-zom-com"" or ""romantic zombie comedy"" - a self-proclaimed new genre and rightly so. This is as about as original as it gets.

","I was really looking forward to enjoying a quirky, English comedy but from start to finish I just could not get into Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>It should be noted that I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies. The genre has always seemed to focus on gore, effects, and thrills over plot and innovation. But I didn't think this would be an issue since Shaun is a spoof.<br/><br/>But it's not a spoof. Or at least not entirely a spoof. Shaun is a conglomeration of spoof, satire, horror, thriller, fantasy, romance, and of course comedy. Very rarely do I enjoy movies that attempt to bridge more than three genres simultaneously. The only similar movie I can recall for comparison is Mars Attacks! (1996).<br/><br/>I had some laughs, but overall I could not slip into the proper mindset to enjoy this film even though I desperately wanted to. At times it was clever and creative by placing average Joes in bizarre zombie situations. But at the same time it suffers from all those traits that infuriate and annoy me in horror and thriller movies.<br/><br/>In short the primary problem was an inability to empathize with the characters. One reason I don't care for horror movies is because the main characters are generally morons. Shaun himself was no exception; he repeatedly makes poor choices and either under or over reacts to all sorts of situations. His mother is a cross between senile and dim-witted. Ed is borderline retarded.<br/><br/>Truthfully, in real life, I can't stand people like Shaun. They are so absorbed in their own problems that they are completely oblivious to their surroundings and events around them. They have no one to blame but themselves for their predicaments. The characters just don't seem to behave realistically, which would be fine if the movie was an outright satire sketch like Monty Python, but it's not.<br/><br/>All in all, I give Shaun of the Dead a 6 / 10, still worth a watch."
"poolandrews","6","53","97","3 January 2007"," A good horror/comedy but somewhat overrated.
","Shaun of the Dead is set in London where Shaun (co-writer Simon Pegg) has problems, his fat mate Ed (Nick Frost) is holding him back, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him & then there's the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living. However, Shaun has a plan to save himself, his mate, his ex-girlfriend & his mum & step-dad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub...<br/><br/>This British French co-production was co-written & directed by Edgar Wright & I have to say I was left a little disappointed by it & I can't quite see where all the glowing praise for it comes from. The script by star Pegg & Wright is obviously a nice homage to George A. Romero's 'Dead' films although to be honest I'd sooner watch Romero's splatter/gore films than this odd mixture of comedy, romance & horror. Shaun of the Dead is all very British & maybe the novelty of it wins people over especially those who don't live here in Britian, unfortunately I do live here & it just doesn't have quite the same affect on me. Apparently both Pegg & Wright were involved in the British comedy series 'Spaced' which to be honest I've never heard of & maybe that's where a lot of it's fans come from. Anyway, it's a moderately successful film & certainly a watchable one, it's amusing, it's pretty clever & well written, it has plenty of fun references to other films, it's a fairly fun film but I found it to be too spoofy, it goes to far into the direction of silliness & some of the things that happen just annoyed me. I'm in two minds really, I will openly admit it's a fun watch but I didn't think it was as brilliant as many seem to think, I doubt I'd watch it again anytime soon & I didn't have as much fun with it as I'd hoped, overall I'd say I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Director Wright does a good job, it's shot like a TV soap opera at times although he manages to juggle the comedy, romance & horror quite well. It's not scary & I didn't find it laugh out loud funny either but I'm sure many of you out there do/will. I like the laddish approach that the modern British male would barricade themselves in a pub & wait for it to blow over rather than head for the plush & sensible surroundings of a supermarket as seen in Dawn of the Dead (1978). There's some gore, someone is torn apart at the end, there are someone gunshot wounds to the head but little else worth mentioning.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Shaun of the Dead is well made although there isn't a great deal of style or flair to it. The acting is good & the cast make their character's pretty likable.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is a decent fun homage to Romero's zombie films, to be brutally honest I'd rather see one of those again than this though. Worth a watch for sure but not as good as I'd hoped & I feel it's slightly overrated."
"bob the moo","Null","53","102","10 April 2004"," Not wholly successful but a solid horror with laughs - fans of Spaced, Black Books etc will love it!
","Shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers.  He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this, his girlfriend dumps him, leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears - `sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into, well, the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.<br/><br/>Although the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this film's release with the (much bigger budget) remake of Dawn of the Dead - however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straight-scares of Dawn.  A point to note for all those moaners, is that this film went into production before the remake did.  Anyway, ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very British affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour.  In essence, if you love Spaced then you'll enjoy this.  The film is NOT a spoof - it is a horror movie with laughs, not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to - instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.<br/><br/>The film has movie references, but not to the point where they become the gags themselves (Spaced's cutaways for example).  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles - the film is still a horror, not a Naked Gun style spoof.<br/><br/>As a horror, the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow, and this will not work for modern audiences, but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood, and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and, aside from a slow start and a more horror-focused ending, this is consistently funny.<br/><br/>The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily (early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily) but it is still true - having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semi-trance!  This is a nice touch - the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made, so it is good to have some here.  Again however, non-Brits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this pub-orientated culture.<br/><br/>The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great, he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable - this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know, but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life, Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran, Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of in-jokes for fans, including a great cameo from Stevenson, who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and (pretty much) TV series background (eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books).<br/><br/>Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far - fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film (horror, comedy, romance, drama, gore) because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film - I hope to god that is not the case."

","Here is another movie that I discovered purely by accident, and could not be happier that I did. One lonely night, looking through the shelves at Blockbuster, I happened upon this and rented it.
This is the story of a lovable loser named Shaun, his ever present friend Ed and his girlfriend Liz. As Shaun tries to be the man Liz needs, while staying the man-child friend Ed needs, he keeps screwing up his relationship with Liz. This leads to her dumping him. The next day, resolved to win her back, also happens to be the beginning of the Zombie apocalypse. The hilarity ensues as Shaun tries to get his mom, Ed and Liz to safety.
What works about this movie is everything. Simon Peg is a huge horror nerd, so there are many outright, the movie title for one, and even more tongue in cheek nods to what came before in the genre. There is also a great social commentary that runs through the movie, where you can see they are trying to show that the human race has become little more than zombies already. This is a perfect fil for anyone that has a sense of humor and likes zombies/horror movies."

"moonmonday","1","49","113","1 June 2010"," Insert Noun of the Dead
","Zombie films are something that many people have tried to make and many people have failed to make well. Even George Romero and Lucio Fulci, it must be admitted, do not have the Midas touch in this genre. This goes ably to show that even when it's a single genre of horror, it's difficult to pin down.<br/><br/>Multi-genre combinations are typically even more difficult to accomplish successfully, and unfortunately that's exactly what Shaun of the Dead tries to do. It fails in more or less every way that it possibly can: it's not well-acted, it's not funny, it's not scary, and above all it's really not entertaining or amusing. It's depressing and sad, and the film's end leaves one with a sense of futility and pointlessness, a sense of having wasted the entire running time on a completely and utterly meaningless thing.<br/><br/>The whole film is spent with unsympathetic and unlikable clods who manage somehow to survive as long as they do through sheer luck and no real ability or even desire to persevere. The humour is hardly passable, even by today's standards; it's often either crass and unfunny or simply unsubtle and unfunny.<br/><br/>The script is as pedestrian as possible, with attempts at tugging the heartstrings merely coming off as manipulative and illogical, especially given the subsequent 'resolution' the film gets. If the viewer is not furious, then he clearly wasn't paying attention. And the scriptwriters certainly weren't paying attention, as the script's coherency is laughable. Even for a comedy, it ought to be much tighter than this happens to be.<br/><br/>After people raving about Shaun of the Dead, it's easy to go in either extreme direction. People jump on the bandwagon easily, especially when friends recommend something, and eventually it reaches a point where people who haven't even seen the film are recommending it to others. The overblown nature of the film, however, makes judgement of it much harsher. If it had been simply the small-time film that it probably was intended to be, it might be easier to forgive. However, as an overrated 'cult classic', it is not worth the praise heaped upon it for being something it is not: namely enjoyable."

Every character is someone you know; every interaction is something you've experienced; every emotion is one you know. Except with flesh-eating zombies.<br/><br/>A brilliantly observed comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead' makes shrewd points about the nature of mass media and consumer culture, the banality of everyday life, love, friendship, fear, and heroism. It also pokes fun at traditional zombie movies, with the undead moving so slowly that Shaun and Ed have time to go through their album collection to determine which records are too precious to be slung at their shuffling assailants. The humour is occasionally gross, but always funny; the observations about how real people would react to an entirely surreal situation are spot on.<br/><br/>An instant comedy classic."

","Without a doubt ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of the worst comedies (if not the worst) that hit the big screen in 2004. The characters of the film have IQ's all shy of 75. Every single one is borderline retarded. The zombies has more of a mental capacity than those of the living. I did not laugh nor so much as break a smile during this entire film. Anyone who has left a review that has stated that this movie is funny, you have been warned. The entire film takes place in about 2 locations, with very few movements along the way. I wasted over an hour of my life to watch this garbage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I've browsed some of the reviews that have been previously written where some of you say that us ""Americans"" can't understand the ""English"" comedy due to various reasons. Trust me when I say that that isn't the problem here. The problem isn't the dialect, nor the fact that the film boasts primarily English actors. The problem with this movie is that the actors are all C class actors. The problem is that they all lack common sense/intelligence above and beyond the norm. The screenplay is down-right awful and it was just as pathetically acted. Poor acting, poorly written and poorly thought out = an extremely poor film.<br/><br/>There is no reason to watch this. You will not laugh, you will not smile. You will waste your time. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a good quality horror/comedy film. I suggest you watch ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"". That movie is without a doubt, hands down 10x better than this film here. I have yet to watch Zombieland, but would also be willing to go out on a limb and suggest that that film as well has got to be better.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review and I certainly hope you take it into consideration."

","I guess you could call this a combination of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Snatch,"" the latter used as a comparison because of it's modern-day dark humor, That's what this film is: a combination of irreverent, modern-day attitudes and profanity from young Brits and a re-make of sorts of a famous horror film.<br/><br/>Here, we these these 20-ish types fighting a mob of the ""undead"" as zombies roam neighborhoods devouring everyone. Our hero (Simon Pegg), a shiftless bum who has just lost his girlfriend due to his ineptness, winds up being the productive guy who saves the day and gets his girl back. Along the way, we get a number of laughs and a number of gross-out horror scenes, and a lot of f- words and the like.

"Serva","1","49","129","22 March 2005"," Yawn of the Dead
","** SPOILERS **<br/><br/>Before I start with the review I'd like to make clear that I am a huge fan of anything that has anything to do with zombie films. I see all I can get my hands on, whether they get good or bad reviews and whether I've heard anything about them or not. Shan of the Dead seemed like a cool idea for a movie, at least prior to when I saw the trailer. After seeing the trailer I thought I'd give it a chance anyway. Something not recommended to others, since that's those 99 minutes of your life that you're never going to get back.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with this movie is the characters. For good drama you need suitable characters to move the story forward. Shaun of the Dead lacks this vital component. In many instances it's hard to tell what the screenwriter was thinking. The following characters inherit this film: The main character Shaun. He is an ugly loser with nothing going for him. He feels sorry for himself the whole film through all the way to the ending, but it's really his own fault that he is a big loser. Shaun has a friend who lives off him and Shaun's other roommate. This guy is a lazy, fat and disgusting slob with no sense of responsibility whatsoever. I forgot to mention that he deals marijuana as his only way of income. Adorable, isn't it? Shaun's second roommate has a job (!!), a sense of responsibility and seems to know what's right or wrong. Constantly throughout the short period of time that this character still survives, he is being called names behind his back by his ""friends"", and he is the one who dies first.<br/><br/>Hold up a second here. Something's wrong. The unsympathetic main characters are morons who nobody can identify with, and the only sensible person in the trio gets killed off quickly. You can't build a movie like this. If you can't identify yourself with the protagonists, you won't care what happens to this and then the movie will not draw you in. I won't bore you with descriptions the rest of the characters, but it's basically the same drill as with the ones I've already mentioned.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is that it's a bit schizophrenic in the sense that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. It certainly is no romantic comedy, because 1. Let's face it: How romantic are zombies, really? and 2. It's a failed attempt at comedy since very few jokes actually are funny. Maybe the last one is because it's a British sort of humor that I don't 'get'. Anyway, the up until the last 20 minutes, the movie tries to be a comedy, then however it gets 100 percent serious and turns into some sort of splatter-horror-drama. This film is not a good film, and it's one of the worst zombie films I've seen and I've seen some pretty bad ones."

","I am a big fan of what I would still call pulp and others would call pulp fiction.

But he is wrong, it is, because the dead have started to walk the earth and feed on the flesh of living.<br/><br/>What we get is basically a funny little comedy involving Zombies. On one hand I can argue that pop-horror works because it takes itself seriously and uses humour to cover the lack of budget, so Shaun of the Dead turns horror completely into a comedy missing the point. On the other hand, I don't know any movie that has ever really delved deeply into Zombies (while other unspeakable evils, such as vampires, werewolves and lawyers have all been suitably looked at). So Zombies are always good for a laugh and treating a zombie movie as a comedy makes more sense.<br/><br/>That sums up the movie, good for a laugh, never rises above that. It contains over 10 times your daily requirement pop culture references and with the best ending to a Zombie movie that I have seen."

The intentions of cast and crew are good, there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless, there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey, banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job, nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back, a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing, Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually, the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies, but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy, The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans, it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall, this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited."

Not to say it's bad, it's perfectly acceptable - but I certainly didn't think it was worthy of this 'cult classic' label that people give it, and the high rating it has here on IMDb.com and all the talk it gets about it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I have no idea why people recommend it the way they do. I get that humor and what people find entertaining is subjective - but I just don't understand the appeal here.<br/><br/>There are definitely better zombie genre films, with better stories, and better characters, out there to enjoy compared to this one."

"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","10","22","29 August 2004"," Not really THAT great.
","It's time for a serious, level-headed review of Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most over-hyped of the year. I'm tired of everyone calling it an instant cult classic. This phrase doesn't make any sense. A cult classic is a film that no one sees by has a small but loyal following. Shaun of the Dead was a big hit when it was released her back in April and it seems like it will do the same when it's released in America thanks to the alarmingly widespread positive word-of-mouth. Everyone seems to be caught up in the off-centre comedy to realize that the film is heavily conflicted and doesn't add up.<br/><br/>First of all, this is not a romzomcom, or whatever. There is no romance, just a guy who wants to make up with his girlfriend while zombies get in the way. And to call it a comedy would be totally wrong, anyone paying the slightest iota of attention would see this film is not a comedy! Some funny moments, yes. But not all the way.<br/><br/>Like most other zombie flicks there is no explanation to why Britain is suddenly overrun by the undead. The plague slowly trickles to life from the odd zombie stumbling around to full-blown hoards of them. Amidst this Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (the great Nick Frost) make fun of the undead and go about dealing with the holocaust in their own silly way.<br/><br/>There are some pretty hard scenes of heavy emotion is this film (I want say what, but some characters do die) that totally contradict the 'comedy' label it's been stuck with. And despite some scenes of graphic violence this is NOT a horror film. It's not a comedy, a romantic comedy a spoof or homage. It simply doesn't know what it is. <br/><br/>Many people believe they got a breath of fresh (or should that be old) air when it was revealed the film would have slow zombies and not the faster ones like in DOTD 2004 and (the dreadful) 28 Days Later. I personally do not understand this overused moan. Slow zombies are not scary; there is no threat from them. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead starts out very stupid and slow. The opening scenes of people doing the repetitive things day in day out are not subtle at all and hammer the point to the audience way too forcefully. Then when the zombies first appear the characters and the audience don't fully realize/appreciate the danger until the last five minutes when the film finally becomes exciting and then that's when we get REALLY ripped off. The film ends way too quickly and conveniently. What a let down after building up so much only to collapse back into the stupid tone the film began in.<br/><br/>Horror buffs will like the zillions of in-jokes and references to other horror movies. To the casual viewer, they will go right over your head. It's about the only thing that's consistent throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the word of over-excited reviewers who are inexplicably giving this film 5 stars. It is in no way the classic they are making it out to be. Good, yes. Entertaining, yes. The best movie you've ever seen/best zombie movie ever/yadda yadda yadda, definitely not. Shaun of the Dead has great potential come from inspiring sources, but the end result is not what the hype is telling you.<br/><br/>Already out in UK, the DVD has great 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound and zillions of extras including Audio commentary from actor/writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, Audio commentary from actors Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Dylan Moran, Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis. Audio commentary from actors Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton, Audio commentary from the zombies!, Extended bits with audio commentary, Outtakes, 'The Man Who Would Be Shaun': Simon Pegg and Nick Frost impersonate Sean Connery and Michael Caine, 'Plotholes': comic strip sequences with voice-over from Lucy Davis, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost including What Happened To Shaun When He Ran Off?/What Happened To Diane When She Left The Winchester?/How Did Ed Get From The Cellar To The Shed?, Extended edits of the TV Shows within the movie: Coldplay on T4 / Fun Dead/Trisha-'Your nine lives are up!'/Trisha-'I married a monster', 'Remembering Z Day': an interview with Jeremy Thompson, 'Electronic Press Kit' featurette, Vignettes: Simon's cam/Lucy's cam/Joe's diary, 'Edgar Wright's and Simon Pegg's Flip Chart': a presentation of the first draft, SFX comparison from Double Negative, Make-up tests, Photo Gallery: photo's by Simon, Lucy and Charlotte, Poster Designs: from the original Oscar poster to the final official poster, 2000AD Strip: 'There's Something About Mary', TV spots, Official trailer, Official teaser trailer, 'Fright Fest' exclusive trailer.<br/><br/>Phew! For those with a multi-region DVD player, get the R2 DVD version. Otherwise you'll have to wait until September 24 (my birthday!!!) for the film to be released Nationwide in America."

","When my family told me they wanted to see ""Shaun of the Dead,"" I was less than thrilled. I thought it would be just another spoof/satire on all the zombie/horror movies that have previously been released.<br/><br/>Was I in for a surprise. Although the first 10-15 minutes of laying the foundation of the movie seemed to be the typical droll, dry Brit humor (and I do mean dry)and very unimpressive, the movie took a turn. During this first 10-15 minutes, I was thinking of reasons why I should leave my seat and do ANYTHING - go to the bathroom, get popcorn, etc. However, I was helplessly stuck, as I had already powdered my nose and had a hot dog on my lap. <br/><br/>All of a sudden,the movie picked up rapidly when Shaun and his hopeless roommate find a little ""drunk"" girl in the garden (zombie), and the poor guys came to the realization she was a monster. This was the turning point, when matters turned from severely dry to utter hysteria!!!! <br/><br/>The plot was exceptional, when you think of two average (and less than average) Joes trying to deal with a zombie in the back yard. When they tried to throw kitchen utensils and, yes, a toaster at her, the whole theater was roaring! I especially loved the old record collection that Shaun frantically used to throw at other zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums he wanted to throw and which he wanted to keep!<br/><br/>The ways in which this average town first of all overlooked the zombies (just another day in town, ho hum) and then, dealing with them and at one point, trying to blend in so they could make their way to the Winchester Pub (I'm laughing even as I'm typing) was hilarious! Just walk like a zombie, don't say a word, and they won't know the difference! Too bad Shaun and his ex-girlfriend had to get into the inevitable spat and blow their cover!<br/><br/>This was an unexpected treasure of a movie, with fresh and innovative writing. I would recommend this movie to all moviegoers!"

","Well people who would have rated this this movie must be either in very good mood or very high on drugs. The first 10-15 minutes was good sensible comedy. Then the movie went down exponentially to total disgusting and non-humorous stupidity.

Also there is lot of bloodshed and gore, which is not funny for zombie related movies.

","As with Hot Fuzz, these directors had the same problem in this earlier production, which most story writers have the hardest battle with: to create a story line with all the strings tied together into a complete movie with a good ending.<br/><br/>Although Hot Fuzz turned out to be a real story mess, Shaun of the Dead feels like it is able to stay on track the longer, mainly probably because the story line in a typical zombie movie is so easily predictable to copy.<br/><br/>With that said, I can only say that Shaun of the Dead follows the now typical pattern of a great start, with a ""meh"" ending."

This was an awful movie. I can appreciate the idea of a spoof on zombie films, but at least do it properly! The attempts at ironic humor and sarcasm were very dry and weak. It was neither laugh worthy nor relatively clever. I wasn't too fond of the acting or the use of a Queen song in the soundtrack. Queen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time, please do not defile their music by featuring it in something as awful as this. All in all, I thought this film was very stupid.

When I got back 5 minutes later, I did not even feel like I missed a part of the film.<br/><br/>The only good thing was the way the camera moved around shaun on his way to the grocery store; that was brilliant.

"dormehl","2","13","34","26 February 2006"," I didn't laugh once.
","Britain excels at a certain type of comedy. Any time there is comedy to be had in the mundanity, tragedy and petty minutae of everyday life, you can be sure that Britain is the country to handle it. Leave the pratfalling to other people - Britain has honed this particular style of comedy for years.<br/><br/>So explain how this film got it so badly wrong? I loved The Office, which this film clearly wants to be - but this film seems to have completely missed the point. It is like a film student trying to make a Tarantino-esquire film and eschewing a good script and hip, funny dialogue (you know - the things Tarantino is actually good at) for a series of slow-motion action sequences set to a retro soundtrack. In short, they have missed the best parts of the comedy style (the awkward glances, the tragi-comedy etc.) for broad,""safe"" humour. And it doesn't work.<br/><br/>But, people tell me - isn't it great to have a Zombie film that pokes fun at the genre. Isn't it original? No it's not. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was using the genre in a similar way long, long before this film came out. And was far cleverer and more subversive than this film could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>I never laughed once during this try-hard-to-be-quirky piece of nonsense. Watch it if you're looking for an average bit of slapstick comedy. If you want something cleverer and more uniquely British watch any number of classic BBC comedies."

Which part aside from the opening lines is supposed to be funny here? The part when he needs to kill a family member? The part where a man is ripped apart and his legs are then used as weapons? If you thought this movie was funny, you deserve to rot in hell. I understand that there were some British jokes, and I understood and was entertained by them for a few seconds. Then those dear to Shaun are brutally killed, and it's apparently supposed to be funny. If you have not seen this, get on your knees and thank whatever god you worship.

"tedg","Null","5","10","13 October 2004"," Looking Down
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Movies are nearly always about other movies, and here's a great example.<br/><br/>In this great piece of writing, we have explicit nods to three layered worlds. There's the world of the viewer, from which the simple artifacts of troubled relationships are drawn. At a rather precise rhythm, this is brought to the front, no matter what else happens.<br/><br/>Then there's the layer of the pubgoers, Shaun and girlfriend. And under that is the world of the zombies. Ted's law is that when you have a film within a film, the abstract distance between the first and second is exactly the same as between the second and third. <br/><br/>The film starts with Liz telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want to be with him any more because she is afraid she will become a zombie. The boyfriend goes around the room and takes apparent zombies and makes up a film for each one: gangsters, porn and so on.<br/><br/>Then, we fall into a movie within the movie as effortlessly as an unwanted, even disturbing song comes up on the jukebox. It all centers on whether the pub is the place for zombies or non-zombies. Every action, every scene is drawn from prior films, and not always straight horror films.<br/><br/>A dog can only look down the levels, never up. Except maybe. In the end, our hero has avoided the pub zombie disease; his buddy has not, which means he is pretty much at the end as he is in the beginning.<br/><br/>'Stacy, Schoolgirl Zombies,' is another, more obvious example.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

I still found the worst part was having to see a decent comedian like Dylan Moran being ripped apart, yes it was fake, yes he isn't really dead, but this film is not a comedy. IT SUCKS!!! Edgar Wright is lucky he made Hot Fuzz (a masterpiece), but Shaun of the Dead should be a reminder of how not to make a film!

","A great idea - to send-up zombie movies - just doesn't hold up. (BTW, before I get going, I haven't ever had an opportunity to watch ""spaced"", so it could be that some of the problems I found are because the in-jokes are lost on me. But even so...)<br/><br/>I loved the beginning of this movie -- the ignored snatches of newscasts, the slowly building feeling of things getting out of control, all done very cleverly (the z-day scene in the snack-shop was great!) It seemed to me, though, that the writer and directory kind of ran out of creative steam, and became more interested in little vignettes, at the expense of the general narrative (most specifically once the escape to the pub begins). Characters seemed alternatively oblivious to their situation and sharply aware of it; for instance collecting weapons, then abandoning them -- but not replacing them (so that after laying about with all sorts of useful implements, they spend vast amounts of time getting to the pub and inside of it totally unarmed, despite repeated opportunities). This takes farce into the realm of ridiculousness, as characters spend apparently endless time doing suicidally dumb things (like arguing, answering phones, etc.) while the zombies take five (or something). There's a line of farce just like there is a line of 'suspension of disbelief' -- disbelief doesn't apply here, but once you cross the line of farce, the audience (or at least me) won't pay attention to the attempts at humor any more. The viewer gives up, as I did, and so I couldn't enjoy the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>A shame, really --'Shawn' had a LOT of potential. If the wit of the first half had extended to whole thing, it would have been quite a gem. It could have been up on the level of the Evil Dead series, but I think it missed the mark rather widely."

","SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2 <br/><br/>Horror and comedy have been going hand-in-hand ever since Abbott & Costello met Frankenstein over 50 years ago and this latest installment of the you've-got-your-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter genre splicing from the Brits is a laugh riot shockfest the likes not seen since George A.Romero's 'Living Dead' films and the early splatter fests of Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>Set in a rural London burg of overcast skies and proletariat listlessness the film begins with our unlikely hero and slayer of zombies in the pasty skinned form of Shaun (Pegg who resembles Mike White, Jack Black's roomie in 'School of Rock'), an electronics store clerk who seems stunted at the age of 29 going on 13, or so his out-of-his-league pretty girlfriend Liz (the fetching Ashfield) feels as she confronts him one night in his fave pub hangout The Winchester. Liz's long-suffering has come to a head and more-or-less expects some drastic changes if Shaun is to be part of her life, namely his pot-smoking lifelong chum and flatmate Ed (Frost who resembles fellow countryman Mark Addy of 'The Full Monty') whose only talent seems to be video games and taking up space. On hand for this revelation is Liz's pals Dianne and David (Davis and Moran, respectively her girlfriend and her unbeknownst would-be lover), a couple of acquaintance, who provide some moral support for the put-upon Liz.<br/><br/>Cut to Shaun's next morning ritual of sleep-walking thru his daily trek to his dead-end job making his rounds to the local bodega and taking in the equally dank and depressive working-class enclave. Unknowingly in the background are some tell-tale signs that something is amiss in the form of an unsettling plague suddenly overtaking the country with out-of-focus TVs in the background showing scattershot footage ofwell you know<br/><br/>Shaun forgets to make dinner reservations for Liz and himself and winds up on the skids with his lady love. Depressed he and Ed go to their watering hole for some soul searching and youth rekindling as they get pissed and rap to 'Whitelines' (in one of several truly funny sequences) as they head home.<br/><br/>The next morning Shaun goes thru his gimlet-eyed routine but there is definitely something wrong and what's so dead-on (puns more to come!) is director Wright (who makes a fine big-screen debut from a career in BBC TV programmes and co-wrote the scabrous ingenious screenplay with Pegg) accurately showing just how brain-dead life can be in the numbing daily constitutionals we take for granted replacing the monotony with monstrosity as a horde of zombies from some unknown viral infection spreads quickly as Shaun and his friends soon realize it's the end of the world as they know it!<br/><br/>Sprinkled with liberal amounts of humor  both scatological and witty in-the-know as well as slapstick  with horror (good amount of biting and one  of many  homage scenes to Romero involving a truly nasty buh-bye a la 'Dawn of the Dead') but not exactly wall-to-wall viscera (although the blood is by the buckets) but shares in spirit more closer to Jackson's 'DeadAlive' with its gonzo-style mix of murder and mayhem and a few echoes of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' Ash character and even Mike Leigh's too-true working stiffs of his oeuvre and Richard Curtis' smart veddy proper British romantic comedies a la 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.<br/><br/>Simon and Frost make a fine comic duo of not-so-dumb and dumber in their bonking on the beans of the undead as well as fine able ensemble including the pretty Ashfield as the slightly-believable gal pal (come on Shaun you're one lucky slag!) and Nighy , late of 'Love Actually', as his stepfather who endures some painful confessions. <br/><br/>The collaborators all have had some significant success across the pond and clearly have the chops in this valentine to the previously mentioned genres (Shaun's blithering mum is named Barbara a nod to Romero's heroine in 'Night of the Living Dead').<br/><br/>The film is riotously funny with sharp editing (lots of montages of items being quick-pan slapped about purpose) and a few startles prior to the onslaught that totally sets the mood of this cheeky and scary horror comedy with a surprisingly sweet chewy center.

More akin to ""Carry on Screaming"" than ""An American Werewolf in London"".<br/><br/>Which is a shame really, because the horror genre has plenty of comic mileage left in it - if you can get the balance right.<br/><br/>And that's another thing.

Ed (Frost) is introduced whilst playing a slot machine, he is overweight, dirty and foul mouthed (a bit of a stereotype) which has me laughing from the start.

They are both fantastic, and the dynamic between them is captivating to watch. The pair have an extremely close real-life friendship, and it translates well to the screen.<br/><br/>All of the other cast members were very good. There wasn't really a weak link, although the characters of David and Diane were a little too much at times.<br/><br/>The direction from Edgar Wright, and the screenplay by Wright and Pegg, is what turns a great concept into an absolute blast to watch. The writing is tight, hilarious, and full of some iconic moments such as the scene in the back garden and the Queen moment in The Winchester.<br/><br/>Whilst the second half of the film is excellent, I actually prefer the first half. The dialogue is a little sharper and it also contains much more humour than the second half.

","""Shaun of the Dead,"" with the title itself imitating those of George A. Romero's zombie films, such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), is a pleasant diversion from more serious fare in the subgenre, especially when, if like me, you've been viewing a bunch of zombie and other apocalyptic dramas during, as of this posting, the pandemic. The parallels between the yawning protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg, also co-writer)--working a dead-end job, returning to the same pub night after night and playing mindless video games with his best mate Ed, much to the frustration of his girlfriend, who seeks more culture and varied experience--to thoughtless, slow zombies is even played purely for laughs instead of as some sort of social commentary along the lines of that with materialism in ""Dawn of the Dead.""<br/><br/>It's amusing, too, how Shaun's obliviousness to his surroundings is largely reflected in our understanding of the story. While there's some dramatic irony when the outbreak initiates, as the spectator will surely pick up on the escalating population of zombies surrounding Shaun before he realizes it, any explanation for the events remain elusive. Humorously, Shaun's first news of the epidemic on TV is cobbled together by his changing the channels, with words and phrases from each show adding up to a report on the undead. We hardly get a look at the newspaper accounts, either, and as soon as the TV is about to tell us what caused the outbreak, the boob-tube is shut up. Contrast this with, for instance, the rambling of talking heads about radiation from a Venus satellite in ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). There's also a funny reference to ""28 Days Later"" (2002), where the outbreak's supposed origins to rage-infected monkeys is dismissed.<br/><br/>The point is that it doesn't matter where the zombies came from or that they're an analogy for some real-world problem; ""Shaun of the Dead,"" regardless, is going to do the same thing that's been done over and over again, whether it be drinking at the pub or being yet another zombie movie, to make light of it. If you're so bitten, like me, to have binged on numerous zombie movies already, such a sentiment is easy to appreciate."

","Shawn of the dead is a great spoof of the zombie genre which is funny and a breeze to sit through. Perhaps the best way to describe the film's comedy is to call it ""British humor."" Don't expect a gag-a-minute affair like Scary Movie, or a TV sit-com approach. Shaun of the Dead's niche is much closer to the one occupied by Evil Dead 2 (and its sequel, Army of Darkness) and Tremors. Those movies understood what makes a good horror movie, then had some fun with the premise, neither taking it too seriously nor utilizing contempt in its ridicule. Shaun of the Dead is a movie that one might not expect to work at first glance, but, for those who don't mind a little laughter with their zombies (or perhaps it should be the other way around), this is an unusual source of entertainment. If you are in the mood for some zombie action, I suggest you watch Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the dead in succession. This is great entertainment."

","Everything in this movie works to perfection. The comedy is on point, the acting, it's a perfect combination of scary and funny, in just the right amounts. My favorite thing about this movie is the directing by Edgar Wright. He has a way of showing thigs that shouldn't be all that interesting in an insanely original fashion. For example, at the beginning of the movie, when Shaun is slowly finding out that there's something wrong, it's shown in an original way. So is everything else in the film. I won't say much, but this is a fantastic film. Also, very emotional and deep when it needs to be."

","This is the only 2nd comic horror film I have seen, having been put off by finding Young Frankenstein unfunny (perhaps a letdown after the brilliant Producers), but I surprised myself in finding this film hysterically funny. What prompted me to try it was the wonderful Simon Pegg, who I saw in an episode of Black Books and the star-studded cast of other comic actors eg Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy). We all know these people: the nerdy but nice fellow in a crap job who lacks the social skills to keep their friends, girlfriends and other folk happy simultaneously, but it was wonderful to watch this ostensibly sad character become the hero in the face of a zombie invasion. This film was entertaining, fast moving, and gripping to the very end, and the elements of sadness, romance, and conflict added to its charm It has whetted my appetite to watch more movies of this genre."

","Slack-jawed, vacant stare, lurching, staggering gait ... I'm not talking about the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"". I'm talking about some of the people I saw after I left the theatre.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" is not scary. What's scary is that there are people out there, around us, among us, who live as though they were zombies. People for whom life is never anything more than working 9 to 5 in a dead-end job, then coming home to spend the evening as couch potatoes in front of the TV or video games. People with no soul or spirituality. People for whom there is no heaven or hell, no thought of survival after death. People for whom mere survival in life is about as much as they can handle.<br/><br/>People of whom John Cougar Mellencamp sang, ""Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.""<br/><br/>As it turns out, the zombies in ""Shaun of the Dead"" are creatures of habit. They may be brain-dead, but they can perform menial, mindless, mechanical tasks -- just like any real live working-class stiff.<br/><br/>I was led to believe that ""Shaun of the Dead"" was a satire on the modern British middle class. Ghoul Britannia, so to speak. Bangers and monster mash.<br/><br/>But ""Shaun of the Dead"" is universal in its import, a comedy with a tragic message. And the message is this: The greatest thing modern man has to fear is not death. It is life in death."

","Something told me, from the first time I saw the trailer, that I was going to love this movie. I'm glad that I can trust my instincts because Shaun of the Dead rocked. Hard. This has to be, without a doubt, the best movie of it's kind since Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" and it's one of the funniest movies I saw all year.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: Shaun is a guy (not much different from me) who works a droning job, spends most of his free time with his roommate Ed, playing video games, and downing beer after beer at the local Pub. In fact, when we first meet him, he's being dumped by his girlfriend Liz, who is tired of the same old routine. Yeah, it takes a while for the zombie action to kick in, but I was having such a good time with Shaun and Ed, I really didn't care. The dialog is so well-written and the chemistry between the two are so good, I would've been satisfied had this been a straight comedy, without zombies. Anyway, on a very bad hangover, Shaun slowly (and I do mean SLOWLY) begins to realize that all is not well in London. He finally puts it all together when a girl shows up in the backyard, falls on a pipe (which impales her), then gets up and proceeds to attack. After watching the news, the two slowly begin to realize that people are starting to turn into zombies and eat each other. In what is probably my favorite scene, the two devise a plan to escape their house, pick up Shaun's mother, kill Phil (Shaun's stepfather, because he's been bitten) pick up Liz, then find a nice, safe place to hide out and wait for things to cool down. The way that the whole thing is shown is flat-out brilliant and if something of it's kind has been filmed before, then I'm just unaware. Love that sequence.<br/><br/>I can't begin to count the reasons why I loved this movie. The acting was topnotch, the dialog will have you quoting for years to come, the directing was brilliant, and then there's the zombies and the gore....Let's just say that ""Shaun of the Dead"" had one of the most gruesome death scenes I've ever witnessed in any movie EVER. All in all, this movie is flawless.<br/><br/>On a side note: I watched this movie ONCE and was able to remember all of the characters names without having to go back and double check myself. Taking my short-term (almost nonexistent) memory into consideration, that's really saying something."

","British humor, how I love it! ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is full of it. Let me make clear right at the beginning that this movie can also be watched by people who are not into Zombie and horror flicks at all. This is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine. There's a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, some horror and, as I said, LOTS of humor! It's easy to tell that the people behind this project have a great love for the Zombie genre. What separates them from geeks like Peter Jackson, is that they don't live exclusively in their fantasy world, but that they have a sharp eye for people's motivations and their way of dealing with everyday problems. Where ""Dead Alive"", ""Bad Taste"" and even ""Evil Dead 2"" drew their laughs from extensive use of blood, guts and over-the-top violence, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is funny because of its debunking look at the lives of average Joes. Somehow the movie follows the tradition of Romero's flicks by unmasking people's weaknesses, but it does that in a much warmer and - again - humorous way.<br/><br/>Shaun is one of us, an everyday guy, who has everyday problems, and keeps having them even in the most bizarre situations. Simon Pegg nails the character. He creates a new Anti-Hero à la Ash without being a pale rip-off of that character. Each cast member has amazing timing and knows how to bring the humor of the script to life.<br/><br/>The only little beef I have with ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is that it gets a little too serious in the end, which is a little inappropriate considering for the rest of the time the viewer plies between grinning incessantly and roaring with laughter.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is an instant cult classic and will gain a huge fanbase. It was about time someone took the throne of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are definitely worthy of that legacy."

If you want to subvert the genre have the lead guy bitten or the girl, the rest has been done before.<br/><br/>A lot may hinge on whether you like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost or whether you have seen enough zombie films to realise that what they're doing isn't as innovative as other reviewers would have you believe."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","4","10","14 June 2007"," A brilliant satire, an often moving drama, and a darn good horror film all in one
","""Shaun of the Dead"" isn't a spoof of the zombie genre. It just isn't the same sort of film as ""Scary Movie"" or even in a sense Pegg and Wright's later effort ""Hot Fuzz"". It's a darker sort of satire, not light hearted and at points it is a reasonably effective drama. Surprisingly, it's actually a bit scarier than your average modern zombie film because it takes the time to develop its characters and make you feel for them. The screenplay is actually human and smart instead of just being a loosely connected series of gore scenes. Zombie films are, and have been for over 25 years now, for the most part simply meaningless gore scenes attached to each other. Remember when Romero was out making films that genuinely horrified you? Remember how terrifying even the dated ""Night of the Living Dead"" still is, and how its sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a wonderful, edgy satire with some truly horrific moments? Sadly, those movies just aren't around any more. With the exception of a couple of gems like ""28 Days Later"", zombie movies are now nothing more than extremely violent action films with a slightly supernatural feel.<br/><br/>It's a simple movie really, Pegg's character Shaun has lost his girlfriend and realizes that his life is going the wrong way so he vows to get his girlfriend back. Unfortunately the day he does this is the day when London becomes 'populated' by the living dead, but Shaun soldiers on regardless armed with only a cricket bat, attempting to save his family and friends. The film doesn't work as well for someone who is unfamiliar with the sort of film that ""Shaun"" is simultaneously making fun of and paying tribute to because it is after all a fan film, jam-packed with references to other films both in the script and visuals (the zooming and quick cutting is directly taken from Raimi's latter two Evil Dead movies). It helps if the viewer is familiar with those films.<br/><br/>At times during ""Shaun of the Dead"" one forgets they're watching a comedy and feels genuine horror and sadness. There are only two or three extremely violent scenes, but the sense of dread, particularly when combined with the generally fun mood of the film, is effective, and when major characters die, you actually do feel a bit sorry for them, which is a lot more than I can say about most zombie movies that have been made recently. The script doesn't focus on making fun of the zombie genre, or more specifically ""Dawn of the Dead"", instead opting to create both an effective satire on the zombie genre AND on our society, much like ""Dawn of the Dead"" did in 1978. Of course, ""Shaun"" is a lot funnier and much less gruesome than that film, but they are so similar in the sense that they were more about people and society than about zombies. Zombies themselves are hardly the most intriguing creatures, they're dumb and slow and really not all that menacing, they lack the creepy sophisticated cruelty of vampires or the pure cruelty of regular human villains.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's direction is superb, and the scene with the zombie in the pub involving Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' is both an excellent bit of comedy and an involving piece of cinema- well-staged, well-shot, and well-acted. The last half hour of the film is less light-hearted and more serious than the rest of the film and includes some genuinely dramatic moments. It is not my intention to make ""Shaun of the Dead"" sound less funny than it is, but it is absolutely, unequivocally necessary to point out that this is hardly just a random spoof of the zombie genre, it does mock the genre in areas, but it is more of a loving tribute to the genre films of past than a heartless spoof of them, which makes it in a sense similar to ""Young Frankenstein"". ""Shaun"" is also a brilliant satire on society, much like the best of zombie films. Actually, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is truly one of the greatest zombie films ever made and an instant classic.<br/><br/>8/10"
"eightie","10","4","10","18 October 2005"," US, UK, you'll enjoy it just the same
","I'm not from the UK (live in NJ), and not a fan of horror movies, but I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead thoroughly. I first saw it on DVD, and watched it twice plus all the additional material, which is rare for me. I'm sure that a few jokes were missed on me (for example, I only found out about the original, Dawn of the Dead, a few weeks after I've watched it), but the greatness of the movie lies not in any one-liners or comedic material. Movies that rely on this are rarely enjoyable when viewed more than once. No, this movie belong to the same category as Spinal Tap: its appeal is in the off-the-wall characters and situations, and in the absurdity of it.<br/><br/>And this, in a nut-shell, is what this movie is: a theater of the absurd. You have people who desperately try to maintain a normal life-style while all around them is chaos; who try to patch up relationships while being attacked by flesh-eating zombies. In one of the best scenes, the main character, Shaun, has his first heart-to-heart talk with his stepfather of 20 years just as the old man turns into a Zombie. In another, Shaun tries to prevent his best friend Ed from throwing an AC/DC record at a zombie in self defense because it is a first edition. And not to mention the laid-back Ed himself, who decides to take a call on his cellphone just when it is imperative that he pretends to be a zombie to avoid being attacked by their kind.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't just a mindless comedy. There's good directing and acting, and the timing and pace are excellent throughout most of it. The plot is very strong and even the TV broadcasts which are intertwined with the movie are entertaining. One word of advice, though: don't show this to small kids. While less terrifying than your average horror movie, there are still some gory scenes."

Directed by Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>The movie written by the director Edgar Wright and actor Simon Pegg whom also plays Shaun in the movie make a hilarious observation on what is an apocalyptic nightmare. Shaun (Pegg) is an over worked lackey who's love life with his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) is dying on it's feet, in his last fleeting attempt to please her, he only makes it worse. Shaun now suffering the heartbreak in the company of his bumbling side-kick Ed (Frost) is soon shocked when the recently deceased come back to life. Wright and Pegg make what seems to be an over indulged film genre back to life and one of the best zombie movies out there. My final rating 10/10."

","So what would happen if you replaced the hero of a zombie movie with a bubbling slacker? Well if you are British, you get Shaun of the Dead. The movie starts out following Shaun around his mundane life. He's still working at a computer store. He still sits in front of the TV flipping channels with his buddy Ed, who is a bigger loser than Shaun is. But his world comes crashing down when his girlfriend dumps him. Oh and the whole city is being turned into zombies, not that Shaun or Ed even notice. That's until Ed notices a weird girl hanging out in their garden. This gives Shaun the idea on how to get his girlfriend back, sweep her off her feet and take her to safety. But Shaun and Ed are no Will Smith and Bruce Willis so hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>The major problem with the movie is that their too many spots in the movie where the scenes are not funny or scary. With a movie that mixes humor with gore, there should be a least one going on at all time. Another problem with the movie is that there is some things that are lost in the translation as it is a British film. While I was watching it, I wondered out load, ""Why would Shaun have a paddle in his shed and why would he grab that?"" Someone then pointed out that it was a cricket bat. And there were a few places where the British slang just went over of my head.<br/><br/>The DVD extras include the usual trailer, documentaries (extremely boring), deleted and extended scenes (good choice taking these out), and blooper reel. One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story. No if only every movie did this. Also, during the film, Shaun and Ed flip through the TV pretty quickly, so in the extra they show extended versions of what they flipped past including a interview with Coldplay who lost some of their members to the zombies and what looks to be the British version of Jerry Springer.<br/><br/>With everything that had be popular oversees, I predicted we will get an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead (spelled Shawn instead)within five years with Stifler as Shawn, Jack Black as Ed, Kate Bosworth as Liz, the nerdy dude from The O.C. as David, some token hot chick as Dianne, and Burt Reynolds as Phillip. And in hopes to rejuvenate his career, Michael Jackson will don the Thriller makeup one more time to be the head zombie that leads the other zombie in a zombie dance. Just make sure Shawn grabs a baseball bat out of the shed."

However, things don't go as planned, because... watch the show. This movie almost single-handedly launched Simon Pegg's career, and justifiably so. In SHAUN OF THE DEAD, there's a plethora of memorable one-liners, quirky characters, and (yes, gentle bloodthirsty viewer) a healthy smattering of bloody zombie action.

A perfect score that incorporates some of the best songs ever into sequences that make you smile from ear to ear and Wright and Co.'s trademark sound effects are just a few of the things that work absolutely perfect and make for a great experience.

"RorschachFTW","10","3","7","16 December 2011"," One Of The Best British Comedy Movie's I Ever Seen
","Part 1 Of The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy In The Horror genre, there's been a few good zombie comedies. Return Of The Living Dead and Army Of Darkness are probably the most famous titles to grave the genre. Shaun Of The Dead is by the best Zombie Comedy since. What makes the film so good is Simon Pegg and Nick Frosts antics on screen. Especially Nick Frost as Ed. he is just hilarious. Shaun of The Dead can easily be seen as the best Zombie Comedy since Army Of Darkness and Return Of The Living Dead because the humour and horror elements are blended together very well to create a unique film with plenty of laugh yet enough horror elements to please the regular comedy viewer and the die-hard zombie fan. The script is very well crafted and the film is clever, witty, and over the top funny. Watching this film is a blast and will guarantee a great time. Shaun and Ed are the main characters, and they try to survive in a local pub during an apocalyptic zombie outbreak. This film is a treasure and the cast does a phenomenal job with a terrific script and story. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are always a pleasure to watch on screen, and Shaun Of The Dead proves it. Shaun Of The Dead is a real treat to watch with family and friends, and is a good film to watch during the Halloween season. Many laughs and scares will abound in this latest zombie comedy genre, and therefore is another addition to the very short list of the best zombie comedies ever made. The film should appeal to every horror fan, as this has all the elements of a good horror film and elements of a good comedy film. Edgar Wright has done a marvelous job at crafting something great here, and Shaun Of The Dead remains one of three most memorable British Horror films. Definitely one of the best horror films in the last ten years. Sam Raimi and Dan O'Bannon would be proud. Considering that this film has George A. Romero's stamp of approval, it should be enough for you to give this a look if you still haven't. Its A 10 Star Zombie Masterpiece!!"

","What to say about this movie. Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest comedies if not one of the funniest movies I have seen in such a long time. What makes this movie different from other films in its genre, is that their are zombies added to the mix. I especially like the way the characters behave when they are trying to figure out how they are going to survive while their home city is infested with zombies. The acting, special effects and make-up is just brilliant. Simon Pegg really knows how to act and he plays his role very well and with a lot of conviction. I like how his character is portrayed as a slacker and a very unreliable person, namely to his girlfriend who dumps him as a result, and gets his but off the couch and tries to save his friends from a zombie apocalypse. Shaun of the Dead is a fun movie."

","Shaun of the Dead has a big problem. The writers love their horror films. Sadly, they love their horror films just a bit too much and spend most of it ripping ideas and scenes from flicks such as Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and dropping in references to other characters and pictures. As a result, you end up with a VERY British hotpot of something 20% original, 80% remake.<br/><br/>The premise is good, the acting is pretty decent and locations and sets are spot on, but when everyone is called Ash and shops are called Landis and posters on the walls are Japanese flicks, you begin to grow tired of the cleverness of it all. Throw in a few ""SPACED"" in-jokes for good measure and you have one of the most geeky monster films ever made.<br/><br/>The good news is, if you grow tired of spot the film reference, you can always play spot the comedian/rock star not-very-funny cameo game instead.<br/><br/>I picked up the DVD of this expecting more.

","I first encountered Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright when a friend of mine introduced me to the English cult-series; ""Spaced"". It's clear that these crazy fellows make movies, just because they love it. It's the kind of ultra-referential meta-manic intertextual stuff that any moviefanatic loves. Almost every scene is a reference to another movie, and the real sport is guessing what movie it comes from.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" follows the same tradition, but with Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" as their main-inspiration. Anyone who tried to analyze Romero's work should know that it's not just about people coming back from the dead to eat the brains of the living. It's a critical comment to the modern zombie-culture one sees when entering a shopping mall. The zombies are consumers, and the are us.<br/><br/>Pegg and Wright has certainly not abandoned this idea, however the zombies are not just mallrats. The zombies are lazy, unemployed, couch-sitting playstation-junkies. The zombies are our TV-culture. Keeping the idealistic ideology, add humour and a passion for movies. - There you have; Shaun of the Dead is funny, original, interesting and quite gory.

Not only is the setup a bit silly(slow-moving brainless easy to spot zombies taking over the world? Yeah, right) but the movie takes itself so seriously, and the fans even more so. Shaun of the Dead doesn't, and that's its strength.<br/><br/>The movie starts as a normal relationship comedy, and Shaun is our regular loser. The whole problem of the dead walking begins just as any problem; something you hear on the news but ignore because you have worse problems. People's reactions to the zombie plague (Don't say the ""z-word""!) is actually pretty realistic and also funny.<br/><br/>The movie uses gore in a good way, and doesn't indulge in it, like the 2004 DOTD remake. Since this is not USA, the Londoners have to use cricket bats and umbrellas instead of shotguns and colts. The classic mall is replaced with a pub, and when Shauns mum tells him she's been attacked on the phone, she refers to the zombies as ""a tad bitey"". It's very British, and I love that.<br/><br/>The cast is good, especially Pegg, who shows a great range o emotions.

The cast are all superb in this film as it wallows its way through London to try to get to the pub.<br/><br/>Pegg is excellent as Shaun, our have a go hero, yet he still kept most of the best lines for Nick Frost (Ed) Peggs real life best friend. The other cast members all do great jobs too, Kate Ashfield (Liz) plays a straight role to a likable enough degree, Dylan Moran (David) is excellent with his sh*t eating grin as Liz dumps Shaun. Lucy Davies (Di) also does a great job with you feeling such sympathy for her just for the look on the girls face. Last but not least Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are as excellent as ever, as i think we all expect from them, as Shauns Mom and Step Father.<br/><br/>The film pays homage to lots of great horror films with slight references to everything from Halloween to An American werewolf in London. But what impressed me the most with this film was the way it stuck to the George Romero zombie flicks, without ever trying to dull it down. The gorefest is exactly what you expect from a zombie film and even though this is a comedy it stays true to the zombie genre. I was also happy that the zombies moved like zombies and not like the running idiots from the dawn of the dead remake, i feel that the slow movement gives a creepier edge to the zombies that modern zombie flicks have lost.<br/><br/>I feel that the hard work of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright deserve to go down in history as a zombie film you should not be ashamed to own.<br/><br/>An instant cult classic Happy Viewing"

"MovieManiacX","10","3","7","12 August 2005"," Hilarious & Scary
","After hearing all of the buzz online about Shaun of the Dead and seeing the Dawn of the Dead remake earlier in the year and enjoying it (though it had nothing to do with or was nowhere near as good as Romero's Dead films, including Land of the Dead), I had extremely high expectations. Needless to say, it far exceeded my expectations. Shaun of the Dead is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>First off, you will enjoy the film more if you like British humor, like Monty Python or Mr. Bean. This is not saying you won't enjoy it if you don't like British humor, but you may not find some of the jokes funny.<br/><br/>The characters are great. Simon Pegg is perfect as Shaun and looks good sporting the white shirt and red tie. Nick Frost is laid back as Ed and pulls it of wonderfully. The always useful Bill Nighy gives a great supporting performance as Shaun's step-dad. All of the other characters are perfect in their roles as well, especially Liz and Pete.<br/><br/>The comic genius of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright is exactly that: genius. The film has so many hilariously funny parts, especially whenever Shaun and Ed encounter zombies. The way they deal with them is gut-bustingly funny. There's great dialogue between the characters, especially between Shaun and Ed, who are obviously friends in real life. I won't give away any of the jokes, you've got to watch it for yourself. The likable characters play off of one another so well that it makes the film ten times better. The film also has many amusing and much appreciated nods to Romero's Dead films. When they talk to Shaun's mom on the phone, listen to what Ed says before they hang up. Being a big fan of Romero's Dead films and horror movies in general, I was laughing at things most people didn't get.<br/><br/>Once the dead rise, Shaun of the Dead becomes an effective zombie movie, but still retains its comedic elements. The zombies themselves are very well done. These are the 'shambling' zombie variety, which I prefer because I find them scarier. The scenes when Ed and Shaun are driving through London are excellent, displaying chaos and lots of zombies (I loved the ambulance zombie, very clever). My favorite scene in the entire film is when Shaun walks to Nelson's shop after the zombies have risen. The movie showcases some top-notch gore, with some chunky zombie bites, messy headshots, and a scene where one character gets ripped in half and eaten. If you're a gore-hound like me, you won't be disappointed. Yummy! <br/><br/>Finally, I loved the music. Edgar Wright utilized some of Goblin's original music from the original Dawn of the Dead throughout the film. It worked well with the film and was a nice nod to Romero. The music through the rest of the film ranges from British pop/rock to Queen and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: <br/><br/>A side-splittingly funny zombie movie with some nice gore and excellent nods to George A. Romero. Shaun of the Dead is the perfect Rom-Zom-Com (romantic zombie comedy)."
"chuckthomas69","10","3","7","3 August 2005"," One of the most seamless blends of Comedy and Horror ever!
","I know, I know... I've barely started this review and I already fear it smacks of hyperbole, but I can't help myself... I have such love for this film, I can hardly contain my geeky joy.<br/><br/>I am a lifelong fan of the Horror movie in all of its forms; from atmospheric and creepy classics to the most exploitative and gory grind-house flicks. My second favorite type of films are Comedies, from cheap scatological humor to the driest British wit. I only mention my tastes here to point out that this movie satisfied me on pretty much every level.<br/><br/>Horror and Comedy are like two sides of the same coin, and yet very few films have really blended them masterfully. I would say that the short list of those which have includes An American Werewolf in London, the Evil Dead trilogy, Dead Alive (Braindead)... and now, Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>I found the horrific aspects of this film wonderfully executed and effective. The scares run the gamut, from quick-cut BOO! shots to subtle, ominous dark shadows to full-out, body-rending gore. And the humorous aspects were likewise varied, from crude bathroom humor to clever puns and pop-cultural references.<br/><br/>Not only does Shaun of the Dead juggle laughs and scares with surprising skill, but this film turns out to have a heart, too. Billed as a Rom-Zom-Com, the fantastic elements of this film are kept in check by the affection of the characters for each other.<br/><br/>The underpinning of this tale of Zombie madness is the everyday life of working-class schlub Shaun, his long-suffering girlfriend Liz and useless slacker buddy Ed. The relationship between these and other characters is really the main story, with the undead plague providing a backdrop for much better dialog than I've come to expect from a Zombie movie. By creating characters that the viewer can care about, SOTD achieves an emotional depth between the gags and the gristle. The last frame of the film is truly a moment that made me laugh and cry at the same time.<br/><br/>Obviously I have nothing but praise for Shaun of the Dead. For me, it was an instant addition to my Top Ten list. I highly recommend that you see it, often."
"anhedonia","7","3","7","15 January 2005"," Very funny until it runs out of steam
","There's no doubt this entertaining British comedy has all the makings of becoming a cult hit, much like the George A. Romero horror films that it pays homage to.<br/><br/>Writers Simon Pegg (who also stars) and Edgar Wright (who also directs) clearly have a lot fun with this story. There are several moments of truly inspired comedy and understated wit. Much of the comedy here works because the actors take themselves seriously. They treat as very real the situations in which their characters get thrown into.<br/><br/>What's clever about this film is that it doesn't come off as a pure spoof of horror films. That would be easy. Too easy. Instead, this is a horror film, but comes packed with laughs.<br/><br/>The best jokes, actually, have little or nothing to do with the zombies and everything to do with Shaun and his friends.<br/><br/>Pegg's ideal as Shaun, a lumbering, clueless twenty-something who works at an electronic store where he's quite possibly the oldest employee. His best friend Ed (Nick Frost) lives on Shaun's couch and plays video games all day. Which is what Shaun would love to do, too, but he can't because his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), wants him to do more with his life.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy is very inspired. Some comedic moments actually have layers to them. For instance, when Shaun and Ed throw Shaun's LP record collection at the zombies. That scene would have worked as it is. But Pegg and Wright add another layer by having the two chaps take time to discuss which records are worth tossing.<br/><br/>And then there's the moment when Shaun, hungover, walks through his neighborhood oblivious to what's happening around him. He's such a creature of habit that he doesn't notice obvious signs of something gone horribly pear-shaped.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Pegg and Wright can't sustain their comedy throughout. The film falters in the final act when Pegg and Wright literally write themselves into a corner. The film suddenly turns into a straight zombie-horror film right out of Romero's handbook. By placing their characters in an untenable situation, a place from where there's little chance of escaping, the story falls into all the conventional traps of the genre. And it's nothing we haven't seen before, right down to characters standing by windows just waiting to be yanked away by zombies.<br/><br/>The flaw in the third act is that Pegg and Wright forgot they're making a comedy. Frankly, zombies aren't all that interesting as movie characters. Shaun and his buddies are. But turning the film into a standard zombie film wasn't the right thing to do. Not only does it bring the comedy to a screeching halt, it also makes the film drag. Even at a mere 99 minutes, this film feels about 10-15 minutes too long.<br/><br/>However, the first two-thirds of the film are awfully funny. It's dry, bold and inventive. Too bad, Pegg and Wright just didn't have enough for a better denouement."

Having lazy days running by their life seems to be; nothing! Shaun's girlfriend leaves him and his having problems with his mum and da.. stepdad.

And soon; London is a city filled with man-eating zombies.. one man has to stop the madness; Shaun...<br/><br/>SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply a small masterpiece. Featuring hilarious scenes as when Ed and Shaun starts throwing old records at two zombies in their garden, discussing what's worth throwing and not. The genius plan going-threw by Shaun, where everybody's smiling like it was all a fancy commercial. Or; the great achievements of ""you've got red on you"", the typical comedy gold of Shaun trying to take a short-cut over a fence... I could go on for ever.

It's got a lots of the same Monty Python achievements of originality and exciting comedy, and being a success world wide! Great use of music in Queen's upbeat hard rocker ""Don't Stop Me Now"" and being placed in one of the movie's must ass-kicking scenes.

","At last, someone has taken the only logical step with a zombie movie: made a comedy out of it!!

Yeah, they eat ya, but you pretty much have to be nailed to the floor for them to catch you.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead has taken this approach with the zombie flick, and has done it to tremendous applause! This film is funny, satirical, a bit tender at times but very entertaining. It is the best approach to a zombie film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It also shows that comedy is not dead, it's just American comedy that's dead.

"aroswald-33960","10","2","4","8 December 2018"," My favorite comedy of all time.
","Good comedy is hard to do, because some people think good comedy would be a joke that is built up until it is finally done, while others think good comedy is a loud noise, like a fart or someone screaming random nonsense. It's hard to make comedy that will stay funny, but that's exactly what Shaun of the Dead does. It stays funny after I watch it multiple times. On many viewings, it was funnier than I remember it being from the previous viewing. But it's not just great comedy that holds this movie up as my favorite comedy.
The story is about a man named Shaun. He can't keep his life sorted out. He makes promises to his girlfriend, Liz, that he can't keep. All the while, a zombie apocalypse has just broken out, and he and his best friend, Ed, have to survive the apocalypse and save Shaun's mom, Liz, and her friends.
I love the story of this movie. Edgar Wright made a movie that is a funny parody of zombie movies, but is also a good romantic comedy/zombie movie alone. All of the characters have amazing chemistry with each other. Shaun and Ed act just like real best friends, mainly because they are best friends in real life. Shaun and Liz do great at acting like a relationship that is falling apart and building back up again near the end. Liz's friends, Dianne and David, are completely opposite characters. Dianne is nice and friendly, as best as she can, to Shaun, while David strongly dislikes to even hating Shaun for his actions and mistakes throughout the movie. Every character here stands out from each other.
The movie is also really well made technically. To think that they were able to get so many extras to play as the zombies near the final act is impressive to me and the lighting, camera work, and editing is great. There's very little cgi in the movie, but the cgi in the movie holds up a little. Some of the cgi hasn't aged amazing well, but it didn't bother me that much.
This is, as I've already said several times, my favorite comedy of all time, and it remains in my top 5 favorite movies of all time list. It's smart, it's creative, it's fun, it's funny, it is a masterpiece. I will always love this movie."

","This movie is kinda the start of non told series of movies which is the result of cooperation between""Edgar Wright"" and ""Simon Pegg"" , The next movie in the series is ""Hot Fuzz"" and then ""At World's End"".<br/><br/>It's better not to compare any of the movie in the series with each other, because they are separated story wise. But the similarities include, the same directing team, almost the same actors team and the same genre.<br/><br/>I saw it as a sarcastic movie about the Zombies idea, the scenes and the comedian parts weren't that funny. But the good thing that they kept everything simple, the idea is simple, the make up and eye lenses of zombies are simple, the killing scenes and the places included are simple, so everything was clear to the point.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a good comedy zombie movie that can get you out of a bad mood although it has some points that may get you bored."

","Taking a satire and turning it into a real movie takes an incredible amount of talent, all-around. Sure, everyone, including me, loves Simon Pegg and his (best) boyfriend, Nick Frost, and they get huge credit, on screen, in turning Dawn of the Dead's spoof Shaun of the Dead into a raging success, even by today's standards. But, it was mainly the writing by both Pegg and (also, Director) Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>I used to be a huge spoof fan, until 2000's Scary Movie, one of my all-time favorite comedies, put an end to actual funny spoofs. Four years later, unbeknownst by me, came Shaun of the Dead, another great parody. I didn't know about it because it fell far under my radar and I probably didn't see this the first time until 5-6 years later. Just recently, (8/31/13) I watched it for the second time.<br/><br/>I am fully aware this lands on a ton of people's top list, and I truly liked it, myself, but I wouldn't go as far to land it in my top whatever list. Okay, maybe spoofs, since there's so few really good ones, but that's about it.<br/><br/>My only real problem is the movie runs out of breath in the last act. Gore replaced comedy in the last third and yeah, it's to remind us this is *also* a zombie movie. But, to me, it felt more like they ran out of jokes and lost focus on what the first two-thirds were all about.<br/><br/>That said, the first two acts were fantastic. Absolutely hilarious and ingenious use of both comedy and the zombie genre, all with deadpan deliveries. Basically, Shaun (Pegg) lives the same droll life and this is affecting his relationship with his girlfriend, but not so much his (best) boyfriend, Ed (Frost.) Unfortunately, for the threesome – eh, maybe also the world, a zombie outbreak occurs and, not coincidentally, mirrors Shaun's existence.<br/><br/>There were many opportunities to exploit the potential humor in a zombie outbreak film, and I doubt writers Pegg and Wright missed a single one. Leading up to our heroes finding out what's going on, and a little beyond the acknowledgment, it was one hilarious scene following the next. Mercifully, they chose the (much preferred by me) slow-moving zombies in order to give the cast a lot more time to give us more entertainment.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen this, and are a fan of zombie films, or even dislike them and would like to see them ridiculed, this is your movie. It is also the teaming of Pegg and Frost's absolute best film, even though they would make a couple more enjoyable flicks.<br/><br/>Gotta love lines like: ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" – Ed."

Though thin on plot, it's a well written and well directed film, more than could be said for any of Romero's films. Great cinematography with long traveling shots, well developed characters (and I do mean characters) and a very subtle build up to the introduction to the first Zombies (though we all know its coming).<br/><br/>If you are looking for some good, bloody fun and are a fan of camp, check out Shaun of the dead."

","SPOILERS Zombie films are the corner stone of so many childhoods. Constantly terrifying children since George Romero's 1968 classic ""Night Of The Living Dead"", the notion has experienced a bit of a revival in recent years. Like so many different topics though, it's always been a curiosity how the rest of the world would cope other than America. In wonderful spoof ""Shaun of the Dead"" we finally learn how your every day Brit deals with the impending threat of the walking dead.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a hopeless 29 year old who works at an electronics store, spends all his time in the pub and has just been dumped by his girlfriend. Now, just when things feel like they can't get any worse, the dead are walking.<br/><br/>A masterful idea, the entire notion of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is pure genius. Transplanting the story of zombies to a typical London flat and it's occupants, there are so many potential ideas and it never ceases to exploit them. Whether BBC Coverage, T4, playing on the Playstation or pub fruit machines, the film is wonderful at poking fun at countless different aspects of the British lifestyle.<br/><br/>Led by a solid performance by main star Pegg, the film has the cream of modern British comedy involved with it. With Dylan Moran, Martin Freeman, Lucy Davis, Jessica Stevenson and countless others, the film's casting is perfect.<br/><br/>There are so many quality lines in this film too, there are times you find yourself laughing at the most random of times. Then again though, this is what you want for comedy.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is amazing. Starring a solid cast and with some classic lines, this film is a brilliant portrayal of how your typical Brit would deal with a zombie threat. A wonderful idea which is played out superbly. Well worth a watch."

","A very funny British comedy and funny parody of the Dead Trilogy. It's unlike Scary Movie or Student Bodies but it is funny nonetheless. The title itself is a pun on Dawn Of The Dead, the film is about an average English worker who is trying to get his girlfriend back and making things right with his parents, until for some unknown reason, the dead begin to walk the earth, and Shaun together with his buddy Ed decide to find their friends and Shaun's mom and girlfriend and get them to safety. It had many funny moments, like the day it started, Shaun and Ed are very oblivious despite news broadcasts that the dead are taking over, and the part when they pretend to be zombies just so they can get past them. The film itself became very impressive to everyone including George Romero himself! I haven't such hilarious stuff like this since Student Bodies. Now, the guys behind this film, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are now given cameos(possibly zombie cameos) on Romero's forth upcoming film of the Dead movies(they should've brought Nick Frost in it). Jolly good show you two, see you in Land Of The Dead!"

","I have never been a fan of zombie movies and never will but this was a slam dunk. The first half is straight comedy and great comedy at that with the second half being more horror with some comedy thrown in. Shaun is a guy who works a average job but doesn't have much on the ball and no ambition to speak of (please stop reading if this hits too close to home which it probably does for most of us guys) not to mention the fact that he is dating a pretty girl who is getting way more than just tired of his backsliding and his complete lack of sensitivity and romantic tendencies. All he wants to do is drink at his favorite pub the Winchester and keep his relationship with her on life support which causes her to break up with him. His roommate is a complete a-hole and his best friend is a loser who doesn't have a job, plays video games nonstop and sells weed. He hates his father-in-law and he is sleepwalking through life. Then things start moving when zombies suddenly start appearing and Shaun has to deal with them. He does the best he can but not being up to snuff on zombie killing he has to try a little harder to save his family, friends and even his girlfriend from joining the legions of undead. The whole film is of course an homage and spoof of the Caesar Romero movies that the whole world has come to know and love and I feel it is worthy of just praise. I would like to see a sequel and there may be one with all the favorable publicity and acclaim Shaun of the Dead has received."
"MatBrewster","8","2","4","18 February 2005"," Solid Zombie Spoof
","The plot is the pretty standard zombie movie stuff. Some type of radiation/virus wreaks havoc on the earth re-animating the dead into brainless, homicidal maniacs. The movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre. The title character, Shaun, is so stuck in his hum drum existence it takes him a couple of days to realize that his city has been attacked by zombies. He has a dead end job, his girlfriend just broke up with him, and his flat mates are constantly fighting. Despite their being several zombies eating human flesh around him and the constant media blitz about them, it literally takes a zombie in his back yard for Shaun to notice. There are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie cliché's.<br/><br/>Here, the zombies walk in the classic, slow motion, brain dead way. They are mockingly slow. In one scene Sean and his friend, Ed, throw a large crate full of junk at two zombies, then have time to run for a crate of records and argue which records are crappy enough to launch. The entire time the zombies are slowly walking towards them to devour Sean and his friend. Other scenes have one zombie being beaten with pool sticks repeatedly to little or no effect. Time and time again there are little digs at the genre conventions while still lovingly following them.<br/><br/>A quick perusal of IMDb's list of trivia for this film will show plenty of references to nearly every zombie film imaginable. I consider myself a fan of zombie films, but these guys must be nuts about them. They've set up multiple scenes that are exact homage to older films. They've lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre. I must say that while reading the list I became more impressed with what the filmmakers created with this picture, but while watching it most of the references went over my head. As I said, I like zombie movies. They're gory, violent, bloody and often hilarious (intentional or otherwise). I have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks. Yet here, most of the references were naught caught by me. I can't exactly fault a film for referencing so many other films, yet I have to wonder who but the die-hard zombie fanatic caught them.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the film is that it is too comedic, without being funny enough. What I mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy. The actors play their parts as if they are in a comedy and not the horrible zombie addled situation that is scripted. Sure, there are a few moments of anguished screaming and fear, but those are over acted and far between. The story is truly frightening, the dead of came to life and are devouring the city. This is not a light hear-ted romp. Though often quite funny, zombie films play the situation straight. I felt let down that everyone was playing the situation for gags and not allowing the comedy to be more organic, or to flow out of the conventions of the genre itself. In the end I didn't find the movie funny enough for all that. It was played for humor all the way through, yet I wasn't laughing nearly enough. Some of this comes from not getting all the ""in"" jokes. Some of this is also, likely enough, because it is a British comedy at heart. There are a number of bits that seem to play better for the British sensibilities than my American in France heart. There were several moments that I could see the joke play out and ""get"" it, but it wasn't enough to really make me laugh. This is not to say the movie isn't funny. Because it is, often hilarious even. It's just that the tone of the film was of great comedy, and the buzz I had heard matched this. Yet while watching it, I didn't find it as funny as expected.<br/><br/>While thinking about this review I began to wonder how I would make a zombie spoof better. It wouldn't be right to go the Zucker brothers way. I got over that type of comedy in junior high, and the genre (well the horror genre which zombie movies are a sub-genre of) has been spoofed in this way enough (see Scary Movie). Slap stick spoofs were perfected by Sam Raimi in the Evil Dead series. In the end I decided that what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film is exactly the way to do it. I just think they missed the mark a little. I think I was partially disappointed because the genre itself has produced enough unintentional humor. Zombie movies are so often insanely bad, they are great fun. It is difficult to spoof a convention when the convention itself is so awful it seems a spoof unto itself. Likewise some of the conventions such as the ineptness and slow walk of the zombies has been revamped by the likes of Danny Boyle. Instead, here, I would have preferred a darker, bloodier movie. I don't believe this would have hurt the comedy. The references and homages could have stayed in tact and comedy could come out of horrific situations."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a selfish,unmotivated loser who lives in North London.He has badly let his girlfriend down once again and is trying to make amends with her.However,as he goes about this,he fails to notice that the world is in the grip of an invasion of flesh eating zombies and suddenly finds himself forced to fight back.<br/><br/>I started to watch the new version of Dawn of the Dead on Thursday night,only for the DVD to mess up about a quarter of the way through.However,I feel I was still able (having seen the original three NOTLD movies as well as the more recent 28 Days Later) to be able to judge the type of movies Shaun of the Dead was parodying.And it was quite an idea and one I'm sure was executed to the best of the ability of all concerned.<br/><br/>Unfortunately,Shaun of the Dead just doesn't rise to the mark for me.As appealing as the jokes are,it's rarely funny (and I stress the word 'rarely' as,admittedly there were one or two scenes that made me chuckle quite a bit),not to mention overlong for the type of film it is.All the best spoofs from the likes of Leslie Nielsen and Jim Abrahams never rised above the hour and a half mark (if that) and this just verges over it's boundaries a bit.<br/><br/>There's also an unexplainably,inexplicably serious,heavy-handed nature to the film in certain parts,i.e. when Shaun is forced to kill his mother that detract from the silly fun element of the story and appear at odds with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I see that the film is to be released in the States pretty soon.Given it's good box office takings over here,it's got admittedly pretty good chances of doubling it's success over the pond.I certainly wish it all the best and hope that a different audience can derive some fun from it that I never did.But then,given 'the dead' wasn't a British franchise to begin with,maybe the yanks will be able to see it and go one better.**"
"gothguy25","Null","2","4","31 August 2004"," One of the funniest best horror movies ever!
","I'm American. Saw this in NYC at a screening set up by Fangoria Magazine. Now, to set up this review, I have been a fan of Britcoms for years from Python to Black Adder to Fawlty to father Ted to Black Books to Young Ones...etc....<br/><br/>So needless to say, I enjoy the dry, dark humor mixed perfectly with slapstick and sarcasm. And I have been a fan of horror movies since I was first scared s***less watching Halloween home alone. (stupid thing to do.)<br/><br/>I simply just loved this movie. At first, like some shows from England, I had to hear the verbiage (they speak quicker than me and have an accent obviously).. but once I found the pacing, I was drawn in as usual.<br/><br/>Clever doesn't do this justice. It blended all the zombie movies I loved with some members of the Office and Python sense of humor. Not many movies can blend them. Fright Night, Lost Boys, Fearless Vampire Hunter, and esp. American Werewolf in London are some of my fav blendings. There were some hilarious moments. Even when people are dying, there were some laughs.<br/><br/>And, at the screening I was at, there were some HUGE jumps from the screen. It's cool to be in the middle of the theatre and see hundreds of people jump in fear at the same time. <br/><br/>Anyway, I digress. Last year, zombie movies were revived by 28 days later (A truly scary and intense movie), and Dawn of the Dead..(A kick ass fun ride.) This cements the humor blend. Don't think anyone could do any better from Hollywood. (Although I would have thrown the Sade album without thinking.) <br/><br/>Anyway.. would have loved to see these slacker gits tackle vampires and such instead of Van Helsing. But, thank God, this movie had plot, deep characters, and a fun sense of style and spirit.<br/><br/>Thanks for a refreshing happy moment here in America, Britian. I certainly needed the charge to my creative life and the sense of fun again in my movie pleasures. :)"
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","10","2","4","15 April 2004"," Better than I thought, actually it was amazing!
","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>Whether or not you like Simon Pegg and the odd but refreshing British comedy he has introduced over the last few years remains to be seen but I think he has answered his critics with Shaun of the Dead.   There are some good zombie films but I am not a keen fan but if I was to say the best one then Shaun of the Dead is miles ahead compared to the rest because I thought it was bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>There is nothing you can say that would convince me that this film was a bad film.  Everything about it was just amazing from the story, the gags, the violence and the classy fast paced editing.   I wouldn't even call this a cheap shot at Dawn of the Dead even though it is clearly better though I do like the original Dawn of the Dead.  Shaun of the Dead has the right to call itself an original zombie film as it has it's own story and no one else's. <br/><br/>Instead of shopping malls we've got pubs which is more better watching especially if you're British because you get al the jokes better.   Also we have our very own hero in the shape of Shaun and what makes this even better is it's sense of humour.   Dawn of the Dead had this but Shaun has it much more and is a black comedy more than anything.   <br/><br/>The beginning scenes where Shaun is oblivious with what is going on around because of his own problems is just great and hilarious to watch because it doesn't look obvious that he is ignoring it.  It just happens to be that he is looking elsewhere and has his mind on different things at the start of the chaos.  What I loved a lot about it also was how everything that was happening around Shaun but he wasn't noticing all the news reports and military trucks going past every five minutes until Shaun becomes aware of the situation.  <br/><br/>It was great to see so many comic characters together in one movie as well like Lucy Davis from the Office and a tiny cameo from Martin Freeman.  Bill Nigh also was good as always but had a more serious role more than a comic one and of course Simon Pegg who is not the next anybody when comparing him to other characters.  You could say he is the next Ricky Gervais or Steve Coogan but he is not, he is Simon Pegg and he has just brought the best screen debut film for an actor to the big screen for the first time and has outdone everything he was capable of.  There is even enough time to have some very emotional parts which will get the better of you.<br/><br/>There are many British comedies that have be turned out over the last few decades but I can honestly say that this is the best since Monty Python bring brought a film to the big screen and that's a fact."

","I must be honest, I've never really been interested in seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', as trailers depicted the film as a slapstick comedy. (I detest slapstick comedies!!) I decided to watch this after seeing the Norwegian horror comedy 'Dead Snow 2' about zombies - a film I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is so much better than expected, and is actually not slapstick. The humor is effective and really funny - some in a creepy way, but still funny. The make-up and visual effects are very good. This film is a family movie compared to 'Dead Snow 2', though. It is not as graphic or gory and the zombies are rather passive. Simon Pegg is excellent as a bit of a hopeless guy, who becomes the film's hero. The rest of the cast were also very good. Bill Nighy, off course, is brilliant in everything he does.<br/><br/>The photography and editing are fantastic. The film is fast-paced and exciting from beginning to end. If you want a zombie film that doesn't feature too much guts and gore with good humor, then 'Shaun of the Dead' is the perfect choice."
"TJFitzy","10","0","0","6 October 2019"," Repetition used the best its ever been!
","The movie follows Shaun, a loser in his 30's who lives a comfortable but unfulfilling life that he coasts through like its on autopilot and how he becomes a better and more happy man thanks to the zombie apocalypse and its downfall. The film uses repetition to convey that using cinematography, for instance, identical long takes of Shaun going to the milk bar and back, one time before, and one time after the zombie outbreak happens.
In a way, the entire setting of the film reflects Shaun, he lives with his two roommates, Ed, (Nick Frost) who's been his best friend since a young age, and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) Who he's known since college. These two characters are the two sides of Shaun. Pete is the responsible adult who has his life together. Ed, on the other hand spend his life on the couch playing video games. These two roommates make up the two sides of Shaun, the lazy and irresponsible man who just drifts through life without dreams or a purpose, and the responsible but boring man who goes to work, gets paid, goes to sleep and repeat. And through these characters is where we find the theme of the movie. Repetition. I've already discussed how the director uses the camera to convey this, as well as characters but he also uses plot and the zombies to convey this message.
The zombies are a metaphor for the average life of the towns people, and just people in general. The opening scene and the scene right before the outbreak conveys this perfectly, the opening scene is a montage of London commuters, all looking bored and identical to the rest of them, like a zombie. The scene before the outbreak conveys this even better, Shaun is wandering around after work, and we see people all around him, and its impossible to tell which have been infected and which are just bored. It's an extremely clever way of communicating to the audience through visuals. Near the end of act one, Liz (Shaun's girlfriend) dumps him, due to him never living life, and just dragging her back to the same pub every night with Ed. And when the whole entire town is finally zombified at the start of act 2, it's up to Shaun to rise up and become someone who is brave and responsible enough to fight back against the zombies and grow up.
At the start of act 2, Shaun and Ed take a car down to Liz's apartment, and we are introduced to the other 2 main characters. Dianne, (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) Lucy is probably the character with the least going on, but for the most part is a good supportive friend to Liz. David on the other hand doesn't like or believe in Shaun, he ends up making situations worse due to his distrust, and though near the start of the film, he seems like the voice of reason, due to Shaun's incompetence. but as we grow to like and trust Shaun we grow to distrust and dislike David, he is also seen facing away from the other characters in the film deepening our distrust of him. Another way of using visuals to tell a story instead of just outright telling the audience to be wary of him.
A big part of the film that I haven't touched on yet is its main genre, it pulls from horror and character drama, as well as romance, but, it's mainly, a comedy and it uses the medium of zombies to tell funny and clever jokes constantly, and use the medium of comedy to foreshadow future events, for instance telling someone: ""You're dead"" as a threat, but then you'll see them in the background as a zombie, or foreshadow the zombie by showing it on the tv
The movie is extremely clever, and every single piece of dialogue is brought up again or referenced in some way later In the film
What really makes the film in my opinion is the editing and screenplay, as well as cinematography and acting. The film is quickly edited, using loads of match cuts and other smart editing tricks to make mundane things exiting and thrilling, parodying over the top zombie movies of the past, but replacing the insane over the top gun-tooling montages with someone brushing their teeth or getting ready for work, adding to the comedic genius that is this movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie, though not my favorite Edgar Wright movie, (that award goes to Hot Fuzz) is extremely witty, tightly written, well shot, well-paced, quickly edited, funny yet bittersweet and British.

","The ""zombie"" first appeared on film in 1930's with White Zombie. Still, they did not become horror staples until Night of the Living Dead (1968). Over the years, zombies have morphed and evolved from slow walking chumps into ravenous hell hounds. For over 70 years, zombies lived on solely within traditional horror. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright changed that notion forever with their breakout comedy, Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>Shaun (Pegg) is a droll waste of human existence whose mediocrity is only surpassed by his flatmate Ed (Nick Frost). After his girlfriend dumps him, it seems only the apocalypse could make life worse for Shaun. To viewer delight, that is precisely what happens. Armed with a sturdy cricket bat, a scraped shovel, and childish enthusiasm, Shaun and Ed set out, vying to survive. There is a sense of familiarity in these protagonists which warmly draws the viewer. We feel Shaun's worthlessness after the breakup. This is in part due to long tracking shots as he accomplishes his daily tasks. Furthermore, as Shaun grows to be a champion and a leader, the shots quicken and character movement grows exponentially.<br/><br/>Between laugh out loud Brit humour and animated gore, there are honestly sweet moments that further beg us empathize with Shaun. And that is the sign of a geat film. A film should grab hold of the viewer, place them in the hero's shoes, and excite them until the credits roll. For those reasons alone, Shaun of the Dead remains a cult classic worthy of praise seldom offered horror films or comedies. It defies two genres wholeheartedly while making no enemies along the way."
"rachelgallit","9","0","0","14 January 2019"," Delightful
","This film is needless to say entertaining, revolutionary take on the classic genre of Zombie Horror. Providing a new perspective and a less than scary view into the lives of apocalypse survivors Shaun and Ed, this movie is a delightful comedy that seems juxtaposed to the dramatic nature of the world in chaos that is collapsing around the oddball pair. By breaking the norm and giving a funny insight into a zombie apocalypse instead of a morose morbid one, the death and destruction seem ironic and cheesy instead of terrifying. The film has a very British sense of comedy, and the pacing and jokes contribute to the lack of severity."

It just makes sense that when English humorists get their hands on this material, it would become sharper and funnier. Shaun of the Dead is pretty damn funny.

It's clear every part in this film was written specifically for the actors who played them. Pegg and Frost obviously have perfect comedy timing but they pulled of just as many dramatic scenes as well. All the supporting actors made the roles their own and played of the two leads well.<br/><br/>The directing in this film is vibrant and alive. Like all of Wright's film, it feels like I could watch this film for days on end and still discover new hidden details and references he put in the film for viewers to discover. The comedy in this film is some of the most inventive I've ever seen. Theirs so many examples of visual comedy as their are in the script.<br/><br/>The romance in this film really didn't do a lot for me. It was by far the most generic and cliche element of the film and I was far more invested in Pegg and Frosts friendship than I was in Pegg trying to win back his girlfriend. As much as I love watching this film I don't consider it much more than a very clever comedy but for Wright's feature debut I couldn't have asked for anything else.<br/><br/>I really do love this film.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is a horror comedy movie directed by Edgar Wright and written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg. The movie stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The movie premiered in 2004 and is about a zombie apocalypse in London from the perspective of a TV salesman without much direction in his life. The movie primarily follows Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, and Ed played by Nick Frost as they navigate the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>This movie is a cult classic. There are countless hilarious scenes that this movie has. There is a wide array of humor here as there are funny dumb moments and funny moments with a long pay off. The humor in the movie does die down in the later parts of the movie with character deaths. This is luckily helped by the good direction in the latter half of the movie. The movie also paces its humor out well as the movie's scenes have many fun small touches that might only be seen by the audience on a second watch. One of the scenes that had me in tears was Shaun walking through the neighborhood after the zombie apocalypse in a mirror of an earlier scene. The movie is filled with these moments that make the movie incredibly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's direction is certainly helpful in this movie. The film moves at an electric pace matched by the electric direction and editing. It was even a joy watching the more mundane parts of Shaun and Ed's lives. The cutting style in this movie helped a lot with making every moment seem fun. I do not think I was ever bored throughout the 99 minutes of running time in the movie. There is not a scene or dialogue wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>The main leads of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Kate Ashfield work incredibly well. These actors have great comedic timing and delivery. It is definitely easy to root for Shaun to prevail as he is this lovable buffoon.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is basic. Anyone that has watched Dawn of the Dead or any mainstream zombie movie can predict the story. Shaun of the Dead does not do anything new to the zombie genre story wise. The newness comes from the comedy in the movie.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is an incredibly well done movie, I highly recommend the movie to both audiences that do not like the zombie genre and existing fans. The movie is one of 2004's highlights.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","As another Brit comedy flick, Shaun of the Dead certainly has some illustrious peers such as Lock Stock and 4 Weddings. However, while it's certainly not in the same league as any of these it still holds its own reasonably well.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is Shaun, an average joe sales assistant in a fairly crummy flat with very little to look forward to. Ed is his best friend and flatmate and when everyone begins to turn into a zombie (This one ain't overly realistic) they put together a motley crew and set out to survive the onslaught of the dead walking.<br/><br/>Yes, more than a nod towards the Romero 'Dead' trilogy is in evidence here, not least of all in the *name*. Plenty of other homages are showcased but it obviously helps to have seen the originals otherwise you just won't 'get' them.<br/><br/>This *is* a comedy, but it lacks a lot of laughs, and that is the main criticism. When it tries to be funny it succeeds, but it doesn't try often enough. This is a huge shame. There are many moments of amusement which aren't belly laughs, but for a comedy you expect to laugh out loud a little more often.<br/><br/>A very clique cast is featured here, with actors and actresses who are known as off-screen friends playing most of the main roles. That chemistry works on screen in places but not all.<br/><br/>The direction does what it's supposed to without being especially inspiring, and the acting is sitcom standard. <br/><br/>Overall it's decent enough entertainment, but ultimately it could have been a bit better."

","The British penchant for understatement and the audience's perfect understanding of slackers mix to make zombie spoof 'Shaun of the Dead' both funny and appropriate for a society that fosters couch potatoes and underachieving 29 year olds. So universal is the satire that Hollywood movie-making and dear old mums are not spared.<br/><br/>Obviously from the title, George Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' and numerous other zombie flicks are cannibalized as they rise themselves from the dead heap of old 'B' movies to amuse audiences, and in this case, scare them as well. Director Edgar Wright, who has many British TV series in his resume, knows enough about contemporary 20-something working class blokes to amuse everyone. <br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg), an electronics store employee, can't live up to the ambitious expectations of his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Most of his time is spent defending his authentic slacker roommate buddy, Ed (Nick Frost), who trashes the living room with junk food detritus and watches endless TV and games. Ed's comic ability at surprise flatulence or imitating an orangutan amuses and endears Shaun to him.<br/><br/>The fun comes when zombies begin roaming London streets and Shaun is so distracted by his own challenges that he doesn't see them. When he does, and he is called upon to act heroically, the Winchester Arms pub, a home for the guys and source of irritation for Liz, becomes home base against the armies of the night.<br/><br/>As in 'Harold and Kumar,' the humor is low, but the pace is leisurely enough not to force the satire, as 'Lost Skeleton of Cadavra' did last year. The characters are fully 'fleshed' enough to make us sympathetic to them, a remarkable feat for movies about zombies where characters are usually as undead themselves.<br/><br/>(By the way, if you want a real contemporary zombie flick, see'28 Days Later,' by British director Danny Boyle ('Trainspotting'). It is the best horror/zombie film since George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead, and maybe better.)<br/><br/>Zombie conventions are fully lampooned in 'Shaun of the Dead'; George Romero would approve. It's funny stuff, so see it in a theater before you turn into a potato watching it on your crumby couch."

That's OK. It doesn't spoil the film in it's entirety.<br/><br/>So hell yeah, there are British references for the British audience, but that doesn't detract from the overall message or story. And yes the British do swear that much, maybe they don't swear enough in the film considering the issues they face.<br/><br/>Finally go see this film. It's not the greatest film ever, maybe not the greatest film you will see this month, but it's funny, sad, gory and a great slash at the slacker generation that you either hate or fear becoming.<br/><br/>Also as you may think, it's not a spoof movie. The laws of physics are standard. We don't have celebrity gags or visual perspective jokes. And on occasions the pathos and depth of feeling in this film are quite stunning. You will never see a horror movie like this in a long time, and at least you will be helping a small independent group of talented writers and actors earn their dues.<br/><br/>Also, I hope the rest of the world has Swing-Ball too; and yes English cricket bats are that strong."

","Anyone who likes Spaced will love this film as it captures all the style and humour of the show, although it isn't loaded with movie references. This is the funniest film to come out of the UK for a long time and, despite it's low budget, looks good too. Like Spaced there is lots of flashy camera work, which doesn't really add much to the film, although it gives it a bit more energy, which is always welcome. The cast are excellent and are clearly enjoying themselves, whether they're playing fruit machines, or having their intestines pulled out. The violence is fairly graphic but there isn't as much as you'd expect, considering the subject matter. One of the best things about the film, apart from it being hilarious, is how unpredictable it is. I was expecting everyone to come out of the pub alive, and I was definitely expecting Shaun's mum to make it. Luckily, this film avoids following any formula, and saves a satisfying twist for the final scene. The only criticisms I have are that Dylan Moran's character was too serious, I was expecting a lot of laughs from him after Black Books, and others were underused. A whole line of British comic talent, including Matt Lucas and Martin Freeman, was wasted as they only appeared for a few seconds. These minor flaws aside, this film is a must-see gem. Can't wait for the DVD."

","What I can say? I was bored the entire time. It was a horror comedy that was neither scary nor funny. The jokes all fall flat, and the overly dramatic scenes were too intense for a feel-good comedy. All the characters were unlikable, and by the end I was rooting for them all to die. One of the cool things about zombie movies is the gore. This movie had almost no gore. Instead of having guns or swords, they hurt the zombies by hitting them with blunt objects. This didn't kill them or destroy their brains. It just dazed them for awhile. Boooring. What a terrible movie. Easily the worst zombie movie ever made.

"sestone111","Null","3","8","27 December 2004"," A Very ""British"" version of a classic.
","From the opening credits with Goblin's music I had somewhat high expectations. I knew it was going to be a comedic spoof of Dawn of the Dead. What I didn't know was that it was going to be a stupid comedic spoof with British punchlines. It was also very slow moving and I couldn't believe for one moment that a guy like Shaun who was so ""anal"" about his life (The dry erase chalkboard on his refrigerator and the way he ""coached"" his employees at the TV store) didn't notice all the chaos occurring all around him. Practically every TV station in England is showing dead bodies and widespread sickness and Shaun and his bumbling roommate are changing the channel to play video games. The rest of the movie reminded me a lot of a Guy Ritchie film with the camera angles and scenes shooting back and forth like lightning. I think that the next time George Romero sanctions anyone to do a remake or spoof of his classic he should do the final edits and ask for more money. By the way folks. Nothing against the British."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","3","8","12 November 2004"," The mixture of British humor with Romero-style horror is indeed a winning combination.
","I had Shaun of the Dead pegged as one of those straight-to-video movies that pops up every once in a while, featuring a clever lampooning of something popular in movies at the time. In the wake of a spectacular remake of Dawn of the Dead, it was not hard to come to this conclusion. But not only in Shaun of the Dead more than a straight-to-video sideshow hoping for a few minutes of attention, it's a tremendous installment in the horror genre that shows that romantic subplots can indeed have a place in scary movies. What is truly amazing is that Jerry Bruckheimer can screw up romantic subplots in movies that seem to demand romance, and yet Director Edgar Wright is able to make it work in a gory zombie movie. This is outstanding!<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are the gradual evolution from a romantic comedy and into a horror film that takes place over the first third or so. The movie opens in a serious conversation between Shaun and his amazingly beautiful and adorable girlfriend Liz, in which they discuss how unhappy Liz is with the way their relationship is going. They each complain about the other's friends, all of whom are sitting right there listening. Shaun's inability to find anything else to do other than hang out at the same pub, the Winchester, and work at the same dead-end job have led to Liz issuing an ultimatum. Change things, or she's outta here. <br/><br/>I love that the movie is so effective both as a horror film and a romantic comedy, while at the same time going significantly out of its way to make fun of those two genres. My favorite is the way the sound is manipulated early in the film. Horror films constantly manipulate sound to create scares and tension (such as the Screeching Cat scare), and this movie makes fun of that tactic, giving extreme close-ups and vastly amplified sound for things like brushing teeth and spreading jam on toast. <br/><br/>As Shaun goes through a typical day the day after his conversation with Liz, he notices things here and there that seem out of the ordinary, like lines of massive military vehicles rushing past his workplace, a man obviously terrified running past him at full speed, and a staggering man across the street who picks up a pigeon with the intention of eating it. If you think about it, most of the more well-known zombie movies start out in the middle of the crisis. They don't take the time to show normal society, they just start out focusing on a small group of people, the last survivors in what is by now an almost complete decimation of the human race, which has consumed itself, you might say. Here, everything is normal, and the movie takes the time to show what it might be like for the average person if the walking dead started eating people and turning them into walking dead as well.<br/><br/>There are frantic news reports that offer vague theories as to what is causing 'the crisis,' but like the military vehicles and other strange things that Shaun noticed, he always gets distracted before he catches on to what is going on, which allows room for some of the most memorable scenes in the movie, like when Shaun and his best friend Ed, one of Liz's major complaints, leave the Winchester that night, pleasantly intoxicated.<br/><br/>In the morning, Shaun wakes up and walks across the street to the corner store, like he does every day, and doesn't notice the chaos that has erupted overnight. When he gets back, there is a hilarious scene where he and Shaun find a zombie stuck in their backyard, apparently unaware of where she is or where to go. This is a perfect example of where the movie most sharply departs from the traditional zombie movie. Shaun and Ed don't react like actors in a gore movie, they react like normal people would in such a situation. When the zombie girl turns around, they look at her shocked, and then laugh at how drunk she must be. When she falls and suffers a significant injury, only to get right back up, the looks on Shaun's and Ed's faces are absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>From this point, the movie turns into the more traditional horror film, but it maintains its originality and romantic comedy portion by stopping occasionally to remind you that the other plot has not been forgotten. There are times throughout the movie where the characters are surrounded by zombies and stop completely to argue about their personal differences. At one point, they are literally surrounded by hundreds of zombies only a few feet away, and Ed stops to sit casually on a nearby bench and talk to someone on his cell-phone. Shaun smacks it out of his hand and essentially tells him that that's exactly the problem with him. <br/><br/>I think that where Shaun of the Dead is most successful is in the blending of these two seemingly incompatible story lines. A lesser movie would have tried to mix together a romantic comedy and a horror movie and ended up screwing them both up, trying to please everyone and ultimately pleasing no one. Shaun of the Dead, however, tried to please everyone and succeeds because it doesn't disenfranchise anyone. It doesn't start as a romantic comedy, then turn into a horror movie that solves the romantic comedy because Liz fell back in love with Shaun, who in the course of the horror portion had become a hero. That's how you screw up a movie with a premise like this. <br/><br/>Instead, the movie weaves this tapestry of horror and romantic comedy, each infiltrating and playing off of the other, becoming in the process a success in both areas and something truly unique. And even if it had done nothing but make a zombie movie unique, it would have been a success, but there is so much more there. Don't miss this one."

","Romantic comedy/horror film (taking place in England) about Shaun and his friends trying to stay alive when the dead come alive and eat the flesh of the living.<br/><br/>Yep--it had to happen eventually--a comedy about flesh-eating zombies. Surprisingly it really does work. This is one of the few movies that successfully mixes horror, comedy and drama. The only other ones I can think of are ""The Howling"", ""American Werewolf in London"" and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"". Not all the jokes work but about 95% of them do. And the dramatic moments actually are well-worked into the plot. And this movie has PLENTY of blood and gore (for an R rated film). If this had been done seriously the ratings board probably would have demanded cuts. <br/><br/>Now I DID like it (and was laughing out loud more than once) but it has some minor problems: most of the characters are extremely unlikable (especially Shaun's best friend); the film has its share of dead spots and some scenes are way too tragic for a film like this. Still, that aside, this is a very funny, gory movie. A must for horror fans. Try to see it with an audience--it really comes alive that way."

","Hearing so much about 'Shaun of the Dead' built my expectations high. 'Shaun of the Dead' is a parody of zombie movies with ever day life; any generation Xer will get the factory/service industry humor. Xers live a very left out, hard paced, brain dead Zombie existence. I can relate to this humor with my job, and the people around me. Over educated Xer's expect more, and have seen a depressing decline in the quality of life, while parents and other generations sometimes do not understand us; the family part of the movie explains this perfectly. Life seems pretty bad after college were one makes all their contacts. There is a lot of social humor about gen X in this film. Many people who live in such situations need a childish friend like Shaun has which Shaun needs for stress releases. No one else understands why Shaun hangs out with his loser friend, but this friend keeps Shaun sane. The Zombie humor would not work if done on this side of the Atlantic; the British have a flair for dry(in a good way like dry red wine) foolish humor. The she's drunk scene was great, along with the dad turning off the car radio. Comedy is hard to do, and the film's makers got away with making a funny movie with such a hard concept. Worth renting the DVD over the going to see it. 6 or 7 out of 10, but I probably buy the movie. I love dry humor. One part of the movie that surprised me is how similar the service industry is marketed with North American style Best Buy and Wal-Mart shops."

This utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the get-go. There are so many sight gags and pop culture references, so many goofy encounters, so much character to the undead, I really enjoyed this. I see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities. It also has a really fine cinematic sense.

"foxhound-37781","10","2","5","16 December 2016"," An underrated comedy if I've ever seen one.
","This is a perfect example of a movie that holds up with age. This came out in 2004 when I was only 14, I'm now 26 and I love this movie even more than when I first saw it, and that really says something.<br/><br/>So what's there to tell about three adults in their late 20's/early 30's who live together in a small apartment?<br/><br/>Well, it's a classic situation if you've ever seen one. Shaun Works, Pete works, Ed just sits on his fat ass all day smoking weed and playing video games. we all know that one person right? Shaun and his girlfriend Liz live apart and seemingly don't spend that much time together apart from hanging out at the same pub over and over and over again which causes tension between Shaun and Liz.<br/><br/>After Shaun and Liz have a rather ugly break up due to their anniversary celebration going pear shaped, Shaun and Ed hit their favorite pub ""The Winchester"" and basically get blind drunk, go home carrying on like lunatics and play loud music till roughly four in the morning (which only gets put to a stop when Pete comes downstairs in a fit of rage).<br/><br/>After they wake up the next morning (obviously hungover as hell), Shaun goes to the corner store (again) to get his paper and snacks as part of his morning routine. Not even realizing what's going on around him, this is easily one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie. There's dead corpses in the streets, Zombies staggering towards him, people running away in fear, he even slips on blood in the convenience store and flat out doesn't even realize. It's almost as if the film wants us to believe Shaun is THAT hungover that he doesn't even remotely see the Zombie apocalypse erupting all around him.<br/><br/>After Shaun and Ed finally get the gist of what's going on they make plans to go and rescue Liz and Shaun's mother. The hilarity only continues when zombies try to break into their apartment and they resort to throwing vinyl records at them as a means of defense. Also, they not only make plans to kill Shaun's father in-law (Phil, who's played by Bill Nighy), but Ed ends up driving Phil's much treasured Jaguar which he's always wanted to do.<br/><br/>The finale at The Winchester is basically just slap stick comedy but it's enjoyable all the same. If you like some funny adult jokes at appropriate times, slapstick style action sequences and just plainly watching a bunch of fools doing what they can to survive with jokes thrown in wherever they will fit, this is the movie for you. <br/><br/>Terrific Comedy any way you look at it, this is the film that made me want to go to London =)"

It's a mash-up mainly of 3 genres: Action, Comedy and Horror... But with some elements of Rom-Com and Thriller.<br/><br/>The action is extremely over-the-top and gory (full of blood, guts and brain splatter). Also it has some VERY funny scenes (including the 'Don't Stop Me Now' bar scene) but also some very sad character deaths.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg-as usual- gives a great performance as Shaun, a 29 year old loser with a dull, easy life and a job in an electronics store. When he's not working at the electronics store, he lives with his goofball best friend, Ed (Nick Frost- who also gives a great performance!), in a small flat on the outskirts of London where they mainly mess around and eat Cornettos. But his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), wishes desperately for Shaun to grow up and be a man. When the town is overrun with zombies, Shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both Liz and her friends and his mother (Penelope Wilton).<br/><br/>It has some very good acting performances and funny dialogue, but also some very sad scenes. Overall it is a great mash-up of genres and it all works and comes together to make one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>So I give 'Shaun Of The Dead' a 9.75/10 or 5 stars."

","It has been nearly 10 years since the release of one of the greatest zombie movies ever made. This film started the infectious zombie craze that still lingers today. I'm taking about Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. A cult fan boy film from the start ""Shaun's"" mix of dry British humor and graphic zombie violence has made it's claim as one of the best. Its a romantic comedy with zombies. It's a buddy picture with zombies. It's many things to many people, but above all it's just a fun movie.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays Shaun, a regular guy who likes nothing more that to spend time with his friends at the local pub called The Winchester. His best mate is Ed an overweight and crude but harmless schlub who has been friends with Shaun since primary school. Liz is Shaun's way to hot girlfriend who is fed up with there stale and predictable relationship. Shaun also lives with his older and more put together brother who tells him to ""Get your s**t together!"". Shaun works as a supervisor at an electronics store with a bunch of unmotivated chowder heads who don't pay any attention to him or what he has to say. To round out Shaun's circle of people is his kind but spacey mum and cold and stern step father Phillip, played by Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>After a long night of drinking at the Winchester, Shaun's usual surroundings start to look a little off. Unknown to him and Ed it seems that the zombie apocalypse has struck. It's kind of hard to notice these things when everybody acts like zombies in their everyday lives. Shaun and Ed finally come to the conclusion that something is not right and hatch a plan to rescue their friends and family and find a safe place to wait out this annoying apocalypse thing. The premise is simple but extremely well done. The script is packed with several memorable one liners and gags that make it fun for multiple viewings.<br/><br/>With their true to life characters and the smart insightful dialogue, filmmaker Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, seem to be channeling Kevin Smith and his debut film ""Clerks"". Along with 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"" and 2013's ""The World's End"" these three film created the ""Cornetto Trilogy"". A Cornetto being an ice cream cone something like a Drumstick, that appears in each film. If it isn't already obvious ""Shaun"" is a movie that should be bought and watched regularly."

","Shaun of the Dead is a zombie comedy-horror movie directed by Edgar Wright and starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, the team behind the TV series Spaced and the movies Hot Fuzz and The World's End which together they form the Cornetto Trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie stars the titular Shaun, a man who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He doesn't like his job, he has problems with his girlfriend and his family, and must always stand up for his lazy, housemate, jobless friend, Ed. All those seem to be the least of his problems when apparently there's a zombie apocalypse taking place outside. Edgar Wright does a brilliant job directing the movie and proves to handle with great touch both humor, drama and action. In the beginning of the movie, we are presented with lots of tips and imagery that the zombie apocalypse is impending, however, since Shaun has to deal with all his personal problems, he barely notices all the signs. There's even a scene where all the news channels talk about this problem, but he just flips the channels carelessly. It's a great comedic touch considering how much it takes for Shaun and Ed to realize there are actual zombies invading.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is clearly an homage to every zombie movie ever made, especially George Romero's movies. The script, written by Pegg and Wright, is full of references and tributes to classic zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead and so on. The trio of Pegg, Wright and Frost really treat the genres of movies they love with lots of respect. The same can be said about Hot Fuzz, which is clearly inspired by buddy cop movies or The World's End, who has it's roots in classic science-fiction stories. <br/><br/>If you're a hardcore zombie fan, this is the movie for you, but it also works great for a casual viewer, who maybe is more interested in the comedy aspect that than the horror. The movie combines excellent touches of humor with some powerful drama. There are a few strong, full of impact scenes that are clearly needed, so that the viewer will know that this is not just a silly parody. It's a real, solid movie with great performances and a funny, clever script. Clearly worth a watch, 8 out of 10!"

Great background information surrounded by the reality that the dead have risen and zombies stagger aimlessly about. The funny thing is that Shaun doesn't notice them as he goes about his day. Satire of zombie movies that only disappoints in its violent and graphic finale. Director Edgar Wright does a fantastic job at keeping everything coherent. Simon Pegg is hilarious as Shaun who must rescue his mother and set things right with his girlfriend played wonderfully by Kate Ashfield. Nick Frost plays the lazy Ed who has his resources in the zombie fight but his video game days will conclude through dead eyes. Bill Nighy is amusing as Shaun's stepfather who will become infected but not without issuing an apology.

"secondtake","7","2","5","15 September 2014"," Great concept, subtle twists, a bit drawn out at times, but a classic, for sure
","Shaun of the Dead (2004)<br/><br/>Clearly ridiculous, and clearly funny. For some it doesn't get much more comic and hilarious, both exaggerated and subtle (actually). By luck (good or bad) I have seen several British movies with the same comic team (the same actors, namely Simon Pegg, but also some background people like director Edgar Wright) and there are more similarities in the plots and funny moments than you might expect. Which means fewer ""original"" laughs. <br/><br/>The main culprit is ""The World's End,"" which is also a good time, but there is the pub at the center of things, and the zombie/androids in both, and a feeling of friends helping friends fight the evils. It's funny once, but be careful twice. (Or, I'm sure, if you think one movie is stellar, you'll possibly love the other.) These two, and another called ""Hot Fuzz"" which I haven't seen, are officially a ""trilogy"" and so are naturally overlapping. Such is success.<br/><br/>This is the classic, and the first, and has its own reputation that goes beyond just another zombie movie. (See also ""Zombieland"" from 2009 which I liked even more, also a spoof.) The funniest aspect of ""Shaun"" is the sense of not noticing the zombies, then the kind of normal approach to having a zombie in your yard, or in your house or car. Or finding that your best friend, or mum, is a zombie. Etc. It brings it away from the horror film genre almost completely. Even when there is chaos and near annihilation, there is also a feeling of hilarity. There is always a ray of hope. And there is love, sort of, that constant rescuer in films of all flavors.<br/><br/>The zombies are terrific—they stay to what I think of as the necessary Romero styled zombie style, with the rules of walking and acting a certain way (unlike ""World War Z"" which was hyped up in that sense). If you worry about zombies entering your world, and want to know what to do, see this one and see of course the very original from the current era, the archetypal ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which as some quality of perfection that can't be ignored. Here of course it makes fun but it does so in a way that says it's all for real, too.<br/><br/>See it!"

Just a blatant remake of American zombie flicks, with a typical Englishness added to that - London streets, beer (I'd hate beer after watching it so much in three parts), pubs, horrible dry English accent and tons of silly profanities that add nothing, mean little and bring even less. Simon Pegg and Co do some decent job here and there, but in general, this is a very boring, overrated and unfunny film with all unnecessary gore, blood, violence and shooting added to the broth.

Unfortunately the movie falls short with non-serious issue and idiotic character. Everything in this movie is only for jokes, nothing more than that, even they solved the ending also with illogical jokes. Shaun character is like an unnecessary hero that drag all his relatives into zombies invasion while Ed character is too dumb and sometimes annoying. Overall, Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" makes a zombie film less painful than ever with some smart and funny lines. But strangely the movie troubled with the joke itself, it's too non-serious for a zombie film even for a parody and some jokes aren't placed in a right time that makes it still few steps behind ""Zombieland""."
"axel-koch","8","2","5","20 April 2014"," An original and thoroughly amusing take at horror parodies
","At a time when idiotic, unfunny, and offensive horror movie spoofs à la Scary Movie were in prime bloom, who would have expected a genuinely amusing parody to come along? Well, probably nobody, and even less so in the case of it making fun of the zombie sub-genre. Against all odds however, the hilariously talented British comedy trio Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost took a try and did exactly that with the applaudably original Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>One reason for that is the gory fun refusing to be a stereotypical cinematic spoof and zeroing in on an at least mostly viable plot, a storytelling trajectory with an actual start and finish, and a realistic and relatable protagonist. Yet, the less positive side of these three arguments also includes that there are a couple of instances of over the top weirdness, spontaneous digressions in the central part, and clichéd supporting roles providing for nothing but laughs and that you wouldn't mind to see served as a midday snack for the undead lurking behind every corner. What makes Shaun of the Dead worth watching in the teeth of all these flaws is its dark and referential humour, even if the gags don't come at minute intervals and rarely are laugh out loud ones as they in return are subtle ones and sure to maintain their amusement at a repeated watch. In addition, the film is, quite surprisingly, superbly made on a technical level, making great use of quick and long shots, different camera angles, multiple forms of lighting, and believable bloodshed.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is far from perfect, even when regarded as nothing more but a comedy, but has something exciting up its sleeve on every level of filmmaking – the pub shoot-out accompanied by Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" is a truly masterful application of music as a means to improve a scene, for example – and is lethally entertaining in every one of its 99 minutes of running time."

","When it comes to off beat comedies, the Poms are in a unique league, they really know how to make a good comedy and Shaun of the Dead is one of the best. Watching it for the first time, I had no expectations of what to expect, and I was not disappointed. The plot centered around Shaun and his mates trying to get through a zombie apocalypse while still getting to the pub for their pint. It had lots of funny moments in it, and I can see myself quoting some of the lines for years to come. This is one of those movies I will be watching again, to catch some of the funnier scenes that I missed the first time. Like Kinky Boots which I only watched recently as well, this was another surprising English movie. Highly recommend."

","Anno 2004: talented director Edgar Wright already proved himself rock solid, having made ""Spaced"": a hilarious TV show that never got the success it deserved and ran from the (very) late 90's to 2001, starring most of the same actors you'll see in ""Shaun of the Dead"". But enough back story: the question awaiting the release of this movie was of course if Wright had enough going for himself to provide the wit his TV-series had for the length of a full-feature film. And he sure did. Shaun (an insanely sarcastic Simon Pegg) and Ed, two immediately likable slackers who also happen to be best friends, live together in a house they rent, find themselves face to face with a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus, right after Shaun's girlfriend broke up with him. Long story short: Shaun's sole target is to get the girl and save his friends and family, while still maintaining his charming sense of humour. I could ramble on and on about how much I love this movie for all it has going for it, but you'll just have to discover for yourself. Think: your typical zombie-movie, with entertaining yet humble personalities and laugh-out-loud, typically British humour. This is the world's first Zom-Com, and believe me when I say it's an absolutely blast."

","There is more fun in the backgrounds and the foregrounds of the sequences of this movie than the original screenplay. This has to be the single reason why it is a great piece of cinema in its new genre.<br/><br/>Comedy & horror rarely go together unless it is some blown-off horror flick which tickles your bone. But, Shan Of The Dead is different as it directly jumps into the scene. What follows is the survival strategy of a group who are not in good terms with each other. Human emotions galore as zombies try to eat the sapiens.<br/><br/>Very strong cinematography pumped with good music makes this a good comedy. With all the gore involved, the horror is lukewarm. Performances are absolutely stunning, especially by Simon Pegg & the girl who played his girlfriend. Zombies did great, too.<br/><br/>Although, towards halfway, the plot does slip into monotony and carries on to induce ennui for some time. But,t hat's forgettable.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended because there are not many movies like it. 8/10!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","With so much craze about the zombies, me and my friend decided to watch something not so new, a movie which came out a bit before the zombie fashion. We actually had no idea it would turn out this good.<br/><br/>This movie started out slow and if you're thinking during the first fifteen minutes whether or not you should turn it off, trust me, it gets better. We were literally shouting at the screen and couldn't get away from the screen - the movie was a thriller masterpiece. And it was not like usual zombie movies or Walking Dead when people with no fear kill zombies straight away - these were normal people with no plan, a lot of fear and a wish to survive. So the two friends - Shaun and Ed decide to round everybody up and hide in their favorite bar until everything cools off. Good plan, right? Well the plan always sounds good in theory, but in practice there's usually a lot of mishaps.<br/><br/>It is actually interesting how from the beginning Shaun shows similarities with zombies - how he gets up from bed, his all morning routine is worked out and he does not have to think at all - just follow the schedule. Life seems simple. Actually, when the zombie fever hits, he only notices that when one of them wanders into their yard and even then they think that the girl is just totally wasted and not dead. The realization only comes after they think they killed the girl by accident and then she rises up to attack them. This is quite scary as it shows how people themselves have become zombies or unaware of their surroundings and their activities that they can't recognize what is going on right in front of their eyes. Mike Rugnetta from PBS idea channel was saying (check out his video here - he has great ideas on the zombie topic) that the craze for zombies started out as a fear that technologies will take us over and in zombie apocalypse the only thing you can trust is yourself and your skills. And that is true as none of the technological wonders like cellphones or computers are really helping out when you need to get away from the zombie horde that is chasing you.<br/><br/>But why I loved this movie was because it was funny, sad and a thriller at the same time and because of the ending: the zombies become a part of the civilization, being pets, loved ones (!) or even having jobs. As funny as that sounds, it is quite scary. I mean it is imaginable to be replaced by a machine as civilization grows, but can you imagine being replaced by somebody who'salready dead?"

","I have never seen a movie that is more quotable then Shaun of the Dead. I watch movies, quote movies, and let them impact my life in many ways but very few have a greater effect than Shaun of the Dead. The title spoofs Dawn of the Dead but this is nothing like it. A zombie movie, yes, but this is an Edgar Wright film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This trio has made some great movies but this is the one that put them on the map. An idiot and his friend try to survive the zombie apocalypse by going to their favorite pub. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the little details any fan of the movie can appreciate. From the opening credits to the very end, everything is connected. In the opening credits there is a girl at a cash register and a black guy checking his phone. These people return later in the film as zombies. Maybe you noticed it, maybe you didn't but I noticed everything. Snake hips, John, his wife, the other old lady, and even Nelson. Characters we see for three seconds or have two lines come back in some way. Every line is on purpose and everything is connected. The 17 year old kid is the same kid who is frequently calling Ed. I know everything about anything in the Shaun of the Dead universe. For the record, dogs can look up.<br/><br/>I quote movies all the time. I have never seen a movie that I quote more than Shaun of the Dead. I probably say ""you got red on you"" at least a few times a week. When I was 17 and somebody asked how old I was I would say 17 just like the kid in the movie. In fact, whenever I say 17 I say it like that kid in the store. Every scene has something funny in it through the script. The chemistry between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg drives this movie. They comedically play off each other all the time. ""There's a girl in the garden."" That entire scene is a riot. The throwing of the albums and kitchen objects was great. The zombie tackles Shaun and Ed goes in the house to get a camera. I laugh every time. Since I have seen this movie I call my mom ""mum"" instead of ""mom"" or"" mama"" that is the effect this movie had on me. <br/><br/>The cinematography and camera angles are also really good. The beginning where the camera bounces back and forth between Shaun, David, Liz, and the other girl was great. The scene where Shaun and Ed are trying to come up with a plan was even better. It is little things like the teeth being brushed to the toilet flushing to the pinning of the Shaun name tag makes this movie great, that and the constant laughs. <br/><br/>Every character in this movie was great. I love Ed, sympathize for Shaun, understand Liz, hate David, and am annoyed with Shaun's mum and the other girl I can never remember the name of. The story is at times obvious, like David being in love with Liz and that causing a love triangle between Liz, him, and Shaun. Now throughout the movie I wanted David dead. He was so obnoxious, all he does is complain and be an idiot, but that poor guy did not deserve what he got. Ed is obviously the best character with laughs from beginning to end. He is a guy I would easily get along with and as dumb as he is the friendship he has with Shaun is real. They have a real brotherhood and I love every second of it.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is a zombie movie. A very funny zombie movie but still a zombie movie so that means a few things. The zombies, the gore, and the endgame. The zombies in this movie look fantastic and the gore is great. When the zombie goes through the pole and her guts go everywhere was unexpected and disturbing, but also kind of funny. I really hope somebody laughed other than me. This movie did get serious as well and had some really emotional moments as well. There is one scene that is just so hard to watch and that is the climax with Shaun vs. David. That scene was so well done and watching the chaos was so entertaining. Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs but I guess I need to address the big question of is it better than Hot Fuzz. No. Plain and simple. The reason, Queen. That scene when Queen comes on the jukebox is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Shaun Ed and Liz are beating the bartender with pool sticks. The zombies are trying to get in, the fire extinguisher going along with the song, everything in this scene worked. I can just see the writers laughing over it as they write it and Edgar Wright directing it with a huge smile. Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a roller-coaster of laughs. There is not a single thing I don't like about this movie. If I had to choose it would be that it is a British comedy and the accents can be too much and some of the language is hard to understand, but who cares. It never slows down, the laughs never stop, and I could watch this every day. I watched this movie countless times with an old friend and I suggest you watch this with as many people as possible. I have never met a person who has not liked this movie so it has to get the WillyT Seal of Approval. When Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright are together expect a seal of approval."
"askewglasses","9","2","5","17 July 2013"," Shaun of the Dead is Purebred Fun
","This has to be one the most original comedies in years. It mixes the genre of horror spectacularly with the comedy. With such a depressing subject which has been explored by people such as George A. Romero, it's not the first zombie comedy, but I do think it is the best. The lines are great, the irony is clever, and each scene leaves you with a smile. Edgar Wright is a brilliant director and I am a fan of his works that I've seen. What works in his movies is the characters are so realistic and you can immediately identify with them. An example would be Ed, he is such a jerk but he's the kind of friend you've known forever. I think everyone has had this type of friend in their life at one point or another. Edgar Wright also has great symmetry with his movies, such displayed early on with two near identical long takes, that are just beautiful to behold. Also nearly every line has a just payoff, making the dialogue also very clever. The comedy is hilarious, the characters are great, and the editing is fast-paced and brilliant which leaves this movie impossible to keep your eyes off."

"aaron-takhar","9","2","5","19 February 2012"," Great,British comedy!
","What a film. Truly one of the funniest British comedies ever made certainly the best rom-com-zom I have ever seen. There are many reasons why it is worth a watch. One is the broad range of humour as it combines witty intelligent humour with simple slapstick comedy to make a wide spectrum of humour also meaning it is harder to get bored or find the humour less powerful. Director Edgar wright stylistically gives us a false sense of security as well as the humour. Surprisingly whilst it is a comedy and one of my favourite funny films off all time and some moments of the film are daft it is more profound than at first glance. The power struggles within protagonist Shaun's life are underrated and it is all about him. Mainly the relationship with him and his girlfriend Liz showed how he struggled in everyday life to cope with keeping her romantically interested with the pressure of his kind of friend David. The relationship between him and David shows that he is a decent character, as they both wrestle psychologically for Liz even though David is in a relationship with Dianne. Whilst the disaster of the zombie outbreak causes his David's character to surface in a negative and he becomes weaker and more resentful Shaun's character emerges in a more positive way as he steps up to become the leader and hero of his gang. The relationship which put most strain on the Shaun was his with Ed as well as Pete. Shaun struggles to defend Ed who is almost blind to what Shaun has done for him, which leads to Shaun doubting his own friendship with Ed when Pete asks aggressively about why they are so close as friends. But the funniest relationship of the film which gave the film a distinct sense of character was the hilarious relationship between Ed and Shaun's mother Barbara there was a tentative nature from Ed showing his child like mentality and there was something endearing about it as well as it being funny and because she is so funny. Barbara is the embodiment of the typical British mother so concerned about everyone else as she ""doesn't want to cause a fuss""; in a stereotypically British way she offers a different character ark to the usual characters in a zombie film someone so oblivious to what is going on. Although the lack of response from anyone is also funny, particularly the scene when Shaun goes down to his local shop and is completely oblivious to the carnage around him and in a typically London argent way goes about his business. Edgar Wright's sense of direction can easily be forgotten but the way he plays around with our expectations of this genre by using mise-en-scene and sound to make us both scared and make us laugh. The media are cleverly employed to spell out to Shaun and Ed and add their own brand of strange humour and the montage bit it is a clever part of the film to address the zombie issue. Overall it lacks significant development in plot as well as enough technical features to be considered an absolute classic but still it is a pioneering film which brings a unique and quirky brand of humour. With intertextual references to The Deer Hunter, Reservoir Dogs and the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers add extra humour to this awesome film and should be watched by all fans of film."

","Let me say this, this movie was friking hilarious!!! The characters were well acted and i can say that Ed was the most funniest. Although this movie is very bloody and gory, it didn't really freak me out because it was meant in a comical way. I can also say that this movie was very touching and sad when all of Shaun's friends and family died by the zombies. This movies plot is very simple. it is just about 2 friends who teams up with Shaun's family and friends to survive the zombie attack. I really recommend this movie to comedy fans or horror lovers. But i have some concerns about this movie. I can say that this movie was very very very short and if it was a little longer it would've been a lot better. And it ended abruptly. But still, this movie is very fun. so overall, 8/10"
"80sHorror","10","2","5","19 November 2011"," A Classic - Absolutely brilliant!,
","Shaun of the Dead is a great film, no questions asked! Its very funny and has great HORROR,a great story and has some excellent acting! The first thing i like about this film is how amazingly funny it is! Although this film may not be that amazing to people who haven't watched any of George A Romero's zombie films as most of the jokes in this film are 'spoofy'. But even if you didn't find this film funny it would still be a great movie, not all great films are comedies! The second thing i like about this film is the acting. Almost everyone who has an acting part in this film has played parts in BBC/ITV dramas or comedies (Casualty and programmes like that)! And in Shaun of the Dead they really do their job well! The films set in the 'rough areas' of a 'rough area' of England so their are no American actors putting on a stupid English accent and all the actors play their parts very realistically, especially Ed (Shaun's best friend)! The story is great in Shaun of the Dead, its very clever the way they seem to place Shaun and 'the gang' in the same situations as the characters off George Romeros films and slip in little jokes! You might of watched the film many times before you notice some of these little hidden grenades of laughter! And if your a fan of zombie films (which you must be really if you want to get the best 'Shaun of the Dead experience') then there is also some violent scenes too! So overall this isn't just great film its incredible, funny, smart and probably the best film of 2004! If you haven't seen this film then don't just watch it but buy it, and buy Dawn of the Dead (make shore its the 1970s version) and watch that before watching Shaun of the Dead. This will help you to understand all the jokes! (This is also a pretty good DVD, there are loads of extras for a single disc edition)"

","If I could say one thing about this film it would be that it is pure comedy gold.<br/><br/>The sheer fact that most of the best of British comedy were involved speaks for itself. What I can't believe is that this film is NOT in the top 250 on IMDb, I mean seriously??? This is a film that will stand the test of time and that generations and generations will watch this and still laugh at it for years to come.<br/><br/>So for all those people reading this review, I will firstly applaud you on your choice but mainly I absolutely insist that you rate this the same as I did. It's a damn shame that this isn't in the top 250, British comedy is an art form that isn't recognised worldwide, yet the actors involved in such titles as this very film get involved with big budget American movies.<br/><br/>I am indeed British myself and proud too which is why I think that this film deserves to be higher rated than it is right now, even if it makes it to 250 I will feel like I've made a difference to the British film industry."
"theproudjester","10","2","5","18 March 2011"," This film should be the staple of any movie-goer.
","As a normal movie-goer, I feel as though it's rather difficult to find a quality modern horror film. A lot of the films you buy tickets to watch today lack originality, they don't grip you like some of the classics would, they feel void of meaning. ""Shaun of the Dead"" blasts through all of these barriers, providing its own unique approach to the genre, engaging you in the plot, and provides a meaningful theme that even a lot of classics don't have.<br/><br/>It's hard to sustain anything other than adrenaline when the focus is on horror alone. This is why it's not uncommon to see horror films paired with comedy -- it induces a little thought into the movie. ""They Live,"" ""American Werewolf in London,"" and the Holy Grail of the combo (at least for me) ""Army of Darkness"" all employ this tactic successfully. Extreme cheesiness the likes of which we see in ""Re-Animator"" sometimes works out great, and one might expect that in a self-described romantic comedy-horror. Strangely enough, the cheese is absent. So what does ""Shaun of the Dead"" provide that is unique? The Pegg-Frost force plays out great, and the subtlety, the one-liners, the goofiness, all fit together perfect and complement the horror. The movie delivers on its promise. It is a >romantic comedy< with horror coming second. You'll get a kick out of the way the issues of basic survival take back seat to the characters' concerns for their relationships.<br/><br/>It is these relationships which illustrate the characters above the two-dimensional. It is a contradiction. As a horror movie, you're waiting for these characters to be food for a ravenous horde of zombies. By the end, you're on the edge of your seat to see how the characters' relationship problems work themselves out. It's not enough to scare the crap out of you (wouldn't be very funny if it was), but it is enough to keep you concerned.<br/><br/>By the end, you can see how the plot works full circle. It speaks to the mundaneness of life. The main character was not fond of the cycle (implied by the banal routines of himself and those around him) he was trapped in because it was pushing him away from the person he loves. Small changes did not help him. It required a huge change in order for him to break this routine and possibly reestablish his relationship, and this change is practically forced upon him by the disaster he and his friends experience. This is true for all the characters, as they are able to speak their minds and resolve conflicts in relationships as the movie carries on. In a parallel fashion, we can look at ourselves and find aspects of our routine that we dislike and can't seem to break out of. Maybe you tried to quit smoking by smoking fewer and fewer cigarettes each day. Did you fail? Try quitting cold turkey, taking up exercising, and reforming the relationships you have. Keep those routines that you are fond of, and move away RIGHT NOW from all of those which bother you.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" is an excellent, funny movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you're seven years behind."
"hnt_dnl","10","2","5","28 July 2010"," Funniest film of the 00s!
","Much as I loved the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost-Edgar Wright vehicle HOT FUZZ from 2007, they're earlier film collaboration SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) is a hell of a lot FUNNIER! For me, the main reason that HOT FUZZ worked was because it was more a great homage to all those 80s/90s action movies (with a bit of British horror sprinkled in there), with many nonstop, neat, nifty references throughout that reminded me lovingly of those flicks I grew up watching and admiring. Yes, HOT FUZZ is a comedy and a well done one, but at the same time, it is definitely more of an homage/tribute/action-oriented vehicle than it is a comedy. Whereas SHAUN OF THE DEAD falls more into the comedy/parody category and a damn funny one at that! <br/><br/>Directed by the super-talented Edgar Wright, SHAUN stars Simon Pegg (in a hilarious performance that was Oscar-nomination worthy) as the titular hero Shaun, a lazy, unambitious bloke who manages a London electronics store. Shaun's frustrated girlfriend Liz (the gorgeous and funny Kate Ashfield) implores him to make something of himself and stop hanging around with his even more shiftless best friend Ed (the eternally hilarious Nick Frost). Liz lives with her best friend Dianne (Lucy Davis in a wonderful, scene-stealing performance), whose boyfriend David (played with stoic, solid humor by Dylan Moran) once was in love with Liz. Shaun's mum Mary (gracefully played by Penelope Wilton) is married to Phillip (vet Bill Nighy), a man that Shaun despises.<br/><br/>This eclectic group gets thrown together one crazy day when flesh-eating zombies (is there any other kind?!) overtake London and they must work their way to the local pub, which SHOULD be safe! Along the way, the group runs into Shaun's friend Yvonne (hilarious Jessica Stevenson) and her group (an utterly funny scene), then before they navigate their way to the pub, Dianne (a wannabe actress) gets the group into character acting like zombies to fool the ones blocking the pub. Once in the pub, personal issues come to a boiling point that coincides with the group's chaotic situation (just like in any disaster film!).<br/><br/>What amazed me about SHAUN was how fast-paced it is. It almost plays like an action movie once the zombie attack starts. The film never really slows down and when it takes time for characters to confront each other, it never loses sight of the severity of the situation and in come the zombies! The humor is dead, solid, perfect, especially the way the characters naturally react to their undead attackers and use their wits (what little they have!) to overcome the situation.<br/><br/>Ironically, although I'm a sucker for horror-slasher flicks, the ""zombie"" sub-genre is the one that I like the least (I'm more into the psycho killer type flicks), but SHAUN is just so funny that it won me over! SHAUN blows the doors off the much ballyhooed, overrated remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD, which came out the same year and slowed down to the point of being a total bore and also had less talented actors in it than SHAUN does. SHAUN is about as funny as REAL comedy gets!"
"Sandcooler","9","2","5","14 January 2010"," Near-perfect homage
","This is often marketed as a parody to Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"", but it's so much more than that. The clever writing makes this a movie with many layers. First of all, it's of course a brilliant pile-up of genre clichés and nods to the source material. It's been three days since I watched this movie and I'm still unbelievably amused by ""We're coming to get you, Barbara"". Then, it's a straight-forward laugh-out-loud comedy. My favourite moment in the entire movie is when they try to kill a couple of zombies by throwing LP's through their faces. That scene was already in the theatre trailer, so I must have seen it countless times by now, but it still gets me every time. Surprisingly, this movie also has some good straight-up horror value. I really didn't expect this to be so gory, the cartoon violence is definitely a plus and fits right in. I also liked how I actually cared about which characters lived and which characters died for a change. That's pretty rare in recent horror efforts, so it was unexpected to find this quality in of all things, ""Shaun Of The Dead"". Long story short: ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is effing awesome."

Throughout the past few years, every once in a while, something by Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost (others including Spaced and Hot Fuzz, which I will see very soon) caught my attention, but never enough to make me buy it. Since I saw it for a very low price, I took a chance I'll never regret. This movie was a terribly fun homage to zombie flicks (mainly the Romero trilogy) and horror films in general mixing in a very unique brand of comedy only these people could make. This movie easily takes a twist from a horror/comedy, to a drama/horror, and back to a comedy (less of a horror). This may sound like a very harmless horror flick, but some violence gets very graphic, one of which is a homage to both Dawn and Day of the Dead. Overall, watch this movie, for it's a LOT of fun."

This is not a stupid movie, as it knows what it is doing and does it well. All of the jokes are well placed and brilliantly timed, and everything ties together in the way you'd expect - but that doesn't make the ride any less glorious. Superb film."

","""Shaun Of The Dead"" has been dubbed a ""zom-rom-com"", meaning a romantic comedy featuring zombies. Yet it really works only in terms of the zombies, and there less on its own merits than in the way it channels famous past films about the undead. It was amusing, at times impressive, but never engaging.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) works a London electronics store, his life as dull and pointless as any other in his sad city. His main problem is reconciling his responsibilities with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) with his other long-term relationship involving layabout buddy Ed (Nick Frost).<br/><br/>""Things will change, I promise,"" Shaun tells Liz. He soon discovers how right he is, after bumping into assorted people with shuffling walks, dead-eyed stares, and a tendency, as Shaun's mother puts it, to get ""a bit bitey"".<br/><br/>Written by Pegg and director Edgar Wright, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is less a send-up than a celebration of the zombie-film culture, playing the comedy less in the manner of a Mel Brooks spoof and more in a way that respects the whole notion of zombies appearing in one's world, attacking loved ones. The laughs come as much from Shaun and Ed's deadpan reactions, and the film's way of teasing the audience with allusions both to other zombie films and to the British television work of the film's stars.<br/><br/>That's too many in-jokes for me, not to mention a singular lack of charisma by any of the film's principals. If not as deliberately off-putting as the work of other British comedians like Sasha Cohen and Ricky Gervais, there's a strong whiff of au currant kitchen-sink misery to ""Shaun"" that deadens a lot of the pleasure to be had. Ironically, ""Shaun"" was shot in part at Ealing Studios, making it an Ealing comedy, though of a different kind than Alec Guinness would have known.<br/><br/>But that's my cultural take, from someone admittedly not a part of that culture. I'm over 40, and this film was not made for me. Fair enough. Does ""Shaun"" work on its own terms? At times.<br/><br/>Mostly, it works as a fairly involving zombie film with real violence and some comic relief. Not as lovable as ""Return Of The Living Dead"" or as clever as ""Evil Dead 2"", it nevertheless keeps things moving and has a good narrative arc all the way to the final big scene, a showdown at Shaun's favorite bar that rivals the Alamo sequence in ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" for desperate intensity. There, the three principals and their companions must stave off a wave of zombies, and the build-up gives otherwise lame ideas like a pool-cue beatdown in time to Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" a real lift.<br/><br/>If only I cared enough about the characters to fret over their horrible fates. Good zombie films manage some emotional remove, and ""Shaun"" does, too, but that works too often at the expense of the ""rom"" and the ""com"". Pegg and Ashfield play well off one another, and there's a fine turn by Bill Nighy as Shaun's unloved father-in-law, but I quickly tired of Ed and found myself at times bemoaning the zombies' slow-footedness.<br/><br/>An okay movie that could have been better, ""Shaun"" works at times on its own self-referential terms. But when people weren't getting killed, I wasn't laughing. That's a strange thing to have to say about a comedy."
"galensaysyes","5","2","5","30 July 2007"," Self-slaughter
","Shaun of the Dead treats itself the same as the zombies it features: does itself in with a blow to the brain. For one-half to three-quarters of an hour, it's an observant and inventive comedy about a meek, clumsy loser, played and shot with much originality; so much that it sometimes skirts incomprehensibility. One can still work out what's going on; the big fault in this section of the film is the sameness of it: the jokes all have a nearly identical tone and substance; it's all really one long joke about the hero's schmoiness, and so eventually it becomes rather tiresome, in the manner of the TV series ""The Office."" It doesn't go anywhere, doesn't develop--but soon we find out the filmmakers didn't mean it to; it's all been a set-up for what they really have it in mind to bring us, which turns out to be a parody of George Romero's zombie movies. This is a letdown at first, if one was interested in seeing where the characters' lives were heading; and then it becomes a retardant: the longer it continues, the shorter a distance the script has to go and the less it has to say, until by the end it's stopped going anywhere or saying anything. A parody of the Romero movies was unnecessary; they were already parodies of themselves, and had exhausted the possible variations in zombie-bashing slapstick, by now an old and stupid trick. I'm not high on comic gore anyhow, I don't find pain and death funny; but on this occasion I especially resented its taking over: it got the movie in the head, too."

"jaredmobarak","9","2","5","14 February 2007"," Don't forget to kill PhilipShaun of the Dead
","Anticipating the release of Hot Fuzz has made me want to see the Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright career works. Having heard how great the UK series ""Spaced"" was, I bought an import from Britain and just recently finished it. The show was great, pop culture abounds, hilarity from start to finish, and much like ""The Office,"" they knew when to stop and not let the show take a fall with filler and repetitioncoughUS ""The Office""cough. What better segway from those two seasons then to go right on to the crew's first feature film, Shaun of the Dead. Now, I own a lot of movies on DVD, and as a result don't get to watch them often, and in some instances have never seen them yet. However, I must have watched Shaun four or five times in the past three years. I find the humor great and the characters well fleshed out and just having a blast with each other. It never gets tiring for me.<br/><br/>Director Edgar Wright shows the ability to appropriate camera shots from other films, like he did with the numerous homage moments in ""Spaced,"" and also a deft handling of the medium, especially with the long one take of Shaun walking into the convenience store, (both times). The way he was able to recreate shots and moments from the beginning of the film, to later on is effective and funny. It's good to see that he has kept a working relationship with writer/actor Simon Pegg because the two go together brilliantly. Pegg co-wrote and starred in ""Spaced"" with Jessica Stevenson, (included in Shaun with a small role). Pegg is naturally charismatic and has perfect comedic timing throughouthelped I'm sure by the fact he is usually playing against, best friend in real life, Nick Frost. The thing with Simon Pegg is that he isn't your usual comedian trying to show range; the guy really can act. He plays the serious moments with the right amount of emotion and reality, and his expressions are always true to the moment. Sure the physical comedy is there, but his characters always work so well without the gimmicks, that when the slapstick comes, it actually works.<br/><br/>Wright and Pegg have definitely stamped themselves all over this film. Using their influences and love of the horror and comic genres, they have created a monster that stands all on its own. Equal parts spoof and real zombie scare-er, Shaun of the Dead is a genre masterpiece, breathing new life into a type of film which has been stale and redundant for the past decade or so, (besides the great 28 Days Later, which has a shot taken at it here). Besides the need for survival amongst the living dead, though, we also have Shaun's quest to become a man and sort out his priorities, the most important being getting his girlfriend Liz back. The fusion of this common romantic comedy plot device and its polar opposite, with horror, works surprisingly well both in the script and the acting. Whereas most horror films just make you bide time as each character is taken out one by one, we are treated here with a group of friends that truly care for each other and meet fate together rather than alone. These people know the genre and never stupidly go into a situation to conveniently be killed.<br/><br/>The humor could never have been as successful as it was without some spectacular actors. Kate Ashfield, as Shaun's girlfriend Liz really adds depth to the film, playing the straight character to the many goofballs running around. I'm not familiar with anything else she has done, but I would assume it is mostly serious stuff as she is one of the few here not playing for laughs. Penelope Wilton is perfect as Shaun's mother and Peter Serafinowicz once again shows how he excels at playing pricks, (like his ""Spaced"" character). Also, like so many films of this ilk, we need to have the token serious actor to give it some credibility. Bill Nighy is that person here and he definitely adds professionalism while fitting in naturally with the crazy cast.<br/><br/>While this is Wright and Pegg's film, they never could have done it without the help of Nick Frost. For being a regular guy and best bud to Pegg while he was starting out in the industry, Frost landed an integral role in ""Spaced"" on the behest of his friend. Pegg wrote into the series a character based on one of Frost's personas that he would do to get laughs. Knowing no one could do the role better, he got Nick into the show despite him having no acting background whatsoever. It was a fantastic move, because he is a natural and in Shaun shows the maturity and growth he has undergone. The guy is a full-fledged actor now and steals every scene he is in, while never being just a copy of his TV role. Frost has range and one of the best deliveries for comedic gems. The few times when the film started to lull, Frost was always there to save the day. Having a familiar rapport with Pegg also helps us believe their relationship and understand the two and where they are coming from. I can't wait to see what the Wright/Pegg/Frost trio can do to the buddy cop genre with this year's Hot Fuzz. If the trailers have anything to say about it, it should be on par with ""Spaced"" and Shaun, if not exceed them both."
"jon2005","9","2","5","22 May 2006"," Shaun of the Dead
","This great comedy, amusingly described by the poster as ""a romantic comedy. With zombies"", comes courtesy of the crew who also gave us the excellent TV series Spaced. To be honest, the film can feel like a TV episode that has been stretched out, and this would probably be a problem if the film wasn't so damned funny! It may be low-budget, but this is a film which is to be watched for the gags, almost as if the zombies were mere coincidence in the story. <br/><br/>With the simple premise that Shaun is a loser who is virtually a zombie stumbling through his life and who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, suddenly finds himself the only one capable of saving his (few) friends when zombies take over. There's a fantastic scene where Shaun is walking to the local shop and back, whilst in the background you see the zombies taking over, all the while without Shaun noticing. It's simple, yet remarkably effective. The story is all in the writing, and it certainly shows. Shaun's first reaction to seeing a zombie is priceless (""Oh my god she's so drunk!""), and his best friend Ed (Nick Frost) is definitely worth a mention as the only person who is more of a loser in life than Shaun. <br/><br/>The film does begin to stall whenever they attempt a ""serious"" bit, but the jokes are flowing like the beer in the Winchester Pub they are trying to reach. It's not a particularly gory film, only in one scene towards the end does it get a bit bloody, but the film succeeds so well because it proves that it doesn't have to be gory to get attention. This one is definitely worth a few viewings  you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Rated: 8.5/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Oh yes, despite my criticism of said movie, I rather enjoyed it... and I will say an 8 is a high ranking for a snooty individual such as myself (see my other rants about Aliens, Titanic, and I think I did one about gladiator, but that's neither here nor there.) I am a sappy horror struck individual who loves the zombie related (I think I orgasmed the first time I played resident evil), and this movie gave me my zombie fix, oh yes! Delightful! And yes, it was indeed a romantic comedy. But somewhere along the line, it stopped being a comedy at all... Was it when he had to kill his mother? Or when they were trapped in the basement of the pub, and Ed was begging for his death? I couldn't tell you. But somehow, somewhen, it slid out of the comedy genre and into the realm of drama. I was distraught! Where was the lighthearted witty banter? The comic smashing of records against a zombie head? By the by, ruining a perfectly good Dire Straits record?!!! But I digress. This was real acting! I felt BAD. I was SAD for Shaun, I felt despair and hopelessness! These are not feelings a romantic comedy brings to me! Somewhere along the line, the movie switched from being a spoof/rom-com into a serious piece of film-making. Don't get me wrong. The actors had chops. Oh man did they have chops! The scene where Shaun turns the gun on his mother? I almost cried, I empathized with him so. But I don't know that something that heavy has a place in romantic comedy, or even romantic zombedy. So I must sigh and rate this fine piece of work an 8 instead of a 10, and declare it a $7 movie. A movie I would purchase were I to see it for $6.99 or so, but no more. Worth seeing, mayhaps even worth buying, if only to have amidst your collection, but not a true and sparkling gem."

","What do you do when Zombies attack? Throw Sade records at them, of course. If you can't kill them, at least you'll put them to sleep. So begins the first line of defense against the undead in Edgar Wright's sometimes cheeky, often sentimental zombie flick, Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>The film stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a loser who decides it's time to take control of his life and relationships just as the world happens to be suddenly overrun by the living dead. It also stars Kate Ashfield as Liz, his girlfriend who wants more than endless nights at the local pub, and Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's long time best friend whose crude nature rightfully annoys those around Shaun. <br/><br/>The story begins with Liz expressing her concern over her relationship with Shaun. They spend their evenings at the Winchester, a local pub of questionable repute. Liz is ready for Shaun to grow up a little, and for the next phase in their lives together. Shaun fails to prove his commitment to change and Liz decides it's time to move on, just before zombies overrun the world. Heartwarming hilarity ensues as Shaun begins to finally show his resolve and rescue his close friends and family from the undead. <br/><br/>Thematically, one of the film's central insights shows that those who resign themselves to apathy may as well be dead (or in this case, undead). This theme is particularly evident in a climatic scene where Shaun and the remaining members of his group are barricaded in The Winchester. Shaun's mother, Barbara, reveals that she's been bitten by a zombie and dies. David, Shaun's antagonist and friend of Liz, berates Shaun and cruelly tells him to kill his mother. His apathy enrages Shaun, who punches him after killing his zombified mother. The director, Edgar Wright, uses a high angle shot to catch David's reaction further emphasizing David's cowardly and low nature. Before David has a chance to fully come to terms with his apathetic nature and apologize to Shaun, zombies abduct him, illustrating the theme of apathy being a kind of death. Wright employs other film elements throughout the picture that may support this theme as well. For example, prior to the zombie invasion, Shaun and Ed say, ""you're dead"" or ""the next time I see him, he's dead"" in a you're-a-goner manner to several other characters in the film who each turn into zombies later. This small ironic motif may be Wright's way of further illustrating Shaun's perception of others' apathy. <br/><br/>Of course, this review would be remiss without mentioning George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, a cult classic that also makes similar social commentary as zombies roam the American shopping mall in search of flesh, brains, and the best sales in town. While Wright's Shaun is a more tongue-in-cheek approach, the similarities are clear, and there are numerous subtle references to Romero's work throughout. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is not a typical horror parody, nor is it a typical romantic comedy. By utilizing different film elements, Wright actually makes a clever social commentary. Defying the horror genre by incorporating elements of comedy and romance, Shaun of the Dead proves many times over that apathy is perhaps the most unfortunate living death."

","I saw this not to long ago, and I can safely say that it is not funny, but hilarious! Shaun of the Dead is an excellent parody of Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead. Shaun is your average British guy who lives with a friend that mooches off of him (Ed) and a girlfriend who just broke up with him (Liz) and a mom who has a very distant relationship with him. (Barbara) During one odd day, Shaun and Ed notice that the townspeople seem to be staggering and groaning. Weird. It becomes weirder when they start biting and even weirder when the news starts warning people to stay inside their houses, because the townspeople have turned into zombies.<br/><br/>The film is well-known for being funny. Apparently, Shaun's dry wit of the situation makes the viewers able to laugh. My friend and I had to re-play the scene where Shaun encounters a zombie and makes a bit of a song with him. It was that funny. The other scenes aren't as funny, but still worth a decent laugh. Shaun certainly provides the silliness needed to pull of big laughs. I also thought the sense of irony made it funny.<br/><br/>David: (while Shaun is off fighting zombies) ""And what's Shaun's big plan? Sitting around in the dark eating peanuts?"" Shaun: (perhaps ten minutes later) Would anybody like a peanut? Aside from that, the film is also a good horror and thriller. Yes, it is a comedy, but it isn't a comedy so silly that it messes up the story line, just to get a decent laugh. The story is the same as Night of the Living Dead, except perhaps a bit sillier. Who says parodies can't be thrilling? I also thought it could qualify as a drama. Various scenes of death and revealed secrets make it fairly emotional. Zombies eating and killing everybody doesn't exactly make you feel good. The characters slightly fall apart, as emotions take over logic, which causes the characters to need to pull together and fight harder in the situation.<br/><br/>There were two main flaws in the movie. The first is that it may be WAY too gory for some people. Yes, it is a zombie movie, but is viewing somebody's insides fully necessary? The second one is that the film lessens as a comedy and becomes more of a drama during the part when the group enters the pub. It takes away some of the light-hearted tone, and takes a more serious tone. I do like drama, but that was kind of disappointing for me, because I really loved the witty comedic moments Shaun of the Dead had to offer.<br/><br/>None of the jokes are over-drawn or too stupid to prevent a laugh. They come by the minute, each one funnier then the next. It really made my day.<br/><br/>8.5/10 <br/><br/>Good: Funny, light-hearted, witty, and makes a decent horror, thriller and comedy <br/><br/>Bad: It's pretty gory, and seems to put an emphasis on horror and drama halfway through the film, which decreases it's comedic level."

","The recent surge of horror remakes has been replete with glossy, flashy movies full of generic scores mixed with meaningless nu-metal music, unoriginal story lines, carnage suitable only for cookie-cutter teen audiences, and the problem of taking themselves all too seriously. What's happened to the inventive, darkly funny horror films of yester-year, such as ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Dead Alive""? Hollywood has all but forgotten what once made horror films great, but it seems that the UK is out to remind them. First with ""28 Days Later"", a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with ""Shaun of the Dead"", a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or ""rom-zom-com"".<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life. He works a dead-end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield). In the midst of trying to sort all of this out, a zombie epidemic just happens to break out, and this only ""exacerbates"" things for him.<br/><br/>Right from the first frame, we get the feeling that this is a thoroughly complete horror comedy, as right away it features The Goblins' score for the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's ""Dead"" series (obviously) to ""The Evil Dead"" to Lucio Fulci. The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well-handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the ""dawn of the dead"" (insert eye-roll here), without even noticing the difference. But what really makes the film outstanding is not just the horror element, but the fact that this would be a hysterical and wonderful film even without the zombie twist. The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes, including a scene where he is forced to shoot his own zombified mother.<br/><br/>Not only does the film keep the laughs and the inventiveness flowing, but it also delivers what so many of the sleek Hollywood horror remakes of late have been forgetting: gore. It's complete with squirting blood, gushing bites, head-shots, and even a disembowling. Also, the ending, though something of a deux es machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Edward Wright (co-writer/director) and Simon Pegg (co-writer) have delivered a film that will satisfy the demands of horror purists, romantic comedy fans, and just about every other kind of moviegoer there is (except for maybe the teens that are in love with ""The Grudge"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)), for it is truly a film that doesn't forget any of the elements of a great horror movie, comedy, or drama.<br/><br/>9/10"

He has a girlfriend who wants more out of life, a couple of roommates who alternate between slovenly and uptight, and a boring dead end job. His girl doesn't get on with his best friend, and he isn't exactly fond of her friends. He is determined to resolve all of these differences, and still tries, even when it seems that the dead have risen and start to terrorize the living. If you've ever had a dysfunctional family or a fight with your girlfriend or boyfriend, you will relate to the characters. If you like zombie movies, look for the constant, though sometimes very subtle, references to every zombie movie that has ever come before. Highly recommended for fans of British comedy, romantic comedy nuts, and devotees of zombie cinema!"
"mikeandthebots","10","2","5","7 July 2005"," Best Film of 2004
","Shaun of the Dead was simply one of the best films of 2004 and one of the best zombie films ever to be put to celluloid. Everything in the movies works. The acting is top notch without relying on any big Hollywood heavyweights (well, at least not big names to us uncultured American swine). The special effects/make up were great too, all the zombies look pretty convincing (not that I've had the misfortune of ever meeting a real zombie). Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's script is what really carries the film. The cyclical nature of the dialogue, the subtle references to other films, and the flat out funny moments elevate this movie from a standard zombie film to a movie unique among its genre. The overall running length of the film (about 100 minutes) is essentially faultless; the film is long enough to tell a complete, logically flowing, self-contained story but short enough to never drag. Wright's discreet direction adds another dimension to the film; with everyone minor character or event returning or being referenced at one point another. Shaun of the Dead also doesn't lose appeal in repeated viewings; if anything it strengthens the movie. A small detail, for example Ed's phone call in the first scene at Shaun, Pete, and Ed's house and the conversation the kid has on his phone at Shaun's work place, could be overlooked quite easily the first time around. Shaun of the Dead became an instant cult-classic in the states upon its limited release in theaters, and will probably stay that way, but deservedly so. While I haven't found anyone I know personally who dislikes the movie, its understandable why it didn't have major box-office appeal (British film satirizing/making a homage to a particular niche of the movie-going audience isn't exactly financial gold). Overall, if you like comedy and like zombies see this movie now, even if you've seen it, see it again."
"rosscamp-1","10","2","5","24 June 2005"," An amazing movie, rife with humor, emotion, and living dead.
","Although some may see this movie as silly and stupid, it is a comic great, destined to be a cult classic. There's nothing better than a cult classic, right? Well, this movie has many jokes that have to be thought about to seem funny. Although Ed's (Shaun's friend) fart is well timed and a quite funny fart joke in the first place, you have to realize that he cut the cheese in the middle of a zombie invasion, when death is practically imminent. Ed's inconsiderance for this fact is really what makes it flat out hilarious.<br/><br/>One of the better jokes that kind of runs throughout the entire movie is that no one knows why it happened, and in the end, Shaun's girlfriend changes the channel on the TV right as you are about to find out. That's funny, too.<br/><br/>Sean Pegg is a very good actor in this film, because he captures the little things in every day life. The way he twitches his fingers when he's talking to his girlfriend about breaking up, the way he forces you to believe that his girlfriend still likes himself, just like he forces his own self to believe that fact, and his dazed look on his face while he's showing TV channels to his customers are all very well done. He has done work extending to HBO's miniseries Band of Brothers (look that up) and worked on Spaced, in case you already didn't know that.<br/><br/>The end of the movie loses it's humor as Shaun is forced to make some very difficult decisions regarding his mother's life, and leaving his best friend behind. But, the humor gets injected back into the movie in little increments like the point where Shaun contemplates how he would kill himself and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>All in all, this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time, topped only by Pulp Fiction. I know that may seem like a stretch, but for me, this is the perfect movie."

","This was one of the best movies I saw in the last year or two. The acting was good, the plot was fairly well thought out, and it was very funny. It helps if you are a zombie movie(i.e. G. Romero)fan and enjoy British type humor(like the Monty Python troupe), but if you are neither it will not stop you from enjoying this movie. It is a weird mix of several genres(coming of age, buddy movie, comedy, love, horror)but it definitely works on all levels. The main characters(Shaun and Ed)will definitely remind you of some slacker you knew(or know) The facial expressions, dialogue, and general behavior of these two make for some of the best scenes in the movie. There are also some very good make-up effects, and a decent amount of gore. This is definitely one worth owning."

","My screen writing professor had us watch this in class one day because it followed the Jack Epps style of writing. <br/><br/>The title put me off. I thought I would have to be subject to another cheesy horror film that I was forced to watch by my older siblings when I was a kid. But I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I liked this movie for its round-about British humor and the zombie action. I have watched many British films and shows and so I understood a lot the humor, whereas my fellow classmates were lost.<br/><br/>Shaun's character is hilarious. I like that he is almost 30 and still lives in a flat with his friend from university but then has his best friend who is practically a schlep and goes on Shaun's dates with Liz. <br/><br/>I liked Shaun's mum as she was trying to not get into the way. The step dad cracks me up with his rigid ways and then trying to keep the Jag all nice and neat while driving through London throughout ""Z-day""<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has great humor and makes great impressions of the zombies. I wasn't put off by their actions in this film as they can be absolutely annoying in other films. <br/><br/>I would watch this any day to keep my spirits up."

It's about getting up off your couch and doing what needs to be done.<br/><br/>With all that being said: it IS a zombie movie.

"as-seen-on-tv","8","2","5","7 January 2005"," Better than what I expected
","The movie Shaun of the Dead is a great British comedy that deals with the every day pressures of one man Shaun, (Simon Pegg) and the inconvenience of his town inhabited with zombies. Unlike the Scary Movie series, this movie is actually funny. The story surrounds Shaun and his best friend Ed, who take it in their own hands to destroy the zombies living in their town, pick up Shaun's ex and mother and get to the pub for a pint of beer. Like I said before, this movie was way better than what I expected. The actors are funny, the script is smart (for a zombie movie). I'd recommend this movie to any one who is interested in British comedy."
"Aaron1375","8","2","5","1 January 2005"," Funny zombie spoof...but not quite as funny as it could have been.
","This movie offers plenty of laughs for the most part and is a very enjoyable zombie spoof movie. Not quite as good though as Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"", it still offers plenty to the viewer to see and laugh about. This movie is about a guy going through romantic problems, and other problems as well such as a dead end job and two other roommates that are on opposite ends of the spectrum causing headaches for our hero. While all these mundane things are going on there are numerous reports of strange happenings being announced, but our hero just switches the channel or ignores it and is completely oblivious to the fact zombies are going on a rampage. It is a bit of a slow set up, but it is funny watching him totally unaware of the fact people are being killed. Then the zombies attack in full force and the movie really picks up. Unfortunately, some times in the movie it seems to be an ""Airplane"" type spoof then in the next turn it gets a wee bit too serious for its own good. These scenes just don't seem to fit in with the rest of the movie. However, it does not deter from the movie all that much and in the end it is very much a comedy first, romance second, and horror a distant third. Some rather nice zombie effects here and there as there is a scene where a zombie falls on a pipe, and another person gets pulled apart, but for the most part it is not a gore fest. In fact, in scenes where people do get killed it seems a bit out of place seeing how light hearted the movie is at times. Worth a look and worth more than a couple of laughs."
"funkyfry","6","2","5","22 November 2004"," Amusing, not classic
","This is a zombie film spoof, and there have been plenty of those before, but this one is a bit different. It's different in the sense that it's not quite as ""goofy"" as others (like the notable ""Evil Dead"" series and Peter Jackson's excellent ""Dead Alive""), this one is played with a pretty dry sense of humor. Shaun is a pretty regular guy who is supposed to lead this whole group of people to safety in the face of a zombie invasion. There are some funny gags; I especially liked when Shaun left his house and walked to his car, not even noticing the zombies (""sorry, no change""). The plot involving several girlfriends works well enough to propel the story, though it isn't really explained why all these other people join him in his strange quest to get to the local pub as if that represents safety and security (Shaun resembles Homer Simpson in this respect).<br/><br/>I think this one will be remembered by a small group that loves it, but for most people this will pass in one ear and out the other."
"FilmOtaku","9","2","5","27 September 2004"," A comedy you can take a bite out of
","'Shaun of the Dead', directed by Edgar Wright presents us the tale of Shaun (Simon Pegg, who also co-wrote the script) who is an Average Joe, living in London who has your normal, run of the mill problems. He has an unsatisfying job, girlfriend troubles, no one gets along with his best friend Ed (the hilarious Nick Frost) and zombies are hunting him. He not only has to try to survive the day being surrounded by them, but has to protect his friends and some of his family while trying to defeat the living dead. For a guy who is very content to live his life in a rut, this proves to be quite a challenge.<br/><br/>Luckily the jokes in 'Shaun of the Dead' are a hell of a lot funnier than my summary line for this review. I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard and so much at a film that didn't have anything to do with the Coen brothers. Not only is the humor in 'Shaun of the Dead' about as dark as it gets, but there are such witty moments that I was left shaking my head at the brilliance of the script. There are several moments where the humor is subtle, yet uproariously funny. A good example is when Shaun wakes up the morning the zombies have taken over, and, incredibly hung over, walks in a daze to the corner convenience store, he doesn't notice that there are huge bloody hand prints on the cooler door then suddenly slips on something the audience doesn't see, but assumes is some kind of blood or gore. This could have gone two other ways  either he wouldn't slip at all, or we would see what he slips on, but the way it was presented made it one of the many times I found myself crying from laughing so hard. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are also absolutely brilliant as best friends and our main protagonists. Their fantastic and natural acting, coupled with the 'real' feel of the dialogue made for some truly standout performances. I am not familiar with either actor, but if they are not already stars, this is surely their breakout film.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have of the film is something that I may have even missed with all of my laughter  I have no idea why there was this sudden plague of the living dead. For a film as entertaining as this one, however, that kind of explanation is something that really isn't necessary; something that I am normally a stickler for. There were also some unexpected poignant moments that seemed out of place, but none of these criticisms diminished the overall effect the film had on me. I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that it is disappointing to say that this is not a film for everyone. Make no mistake, 'Shaun of the Dead' is at times extremely violent and quite gory, and it's blackest of black humor is not going to appeal to many, but if you want to see a brilliant comedy that is going to make you cringe while making you laugh out loud, this is your movie. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"Pasafist","Null","2","5","26 September 2004"," A Funny Romantic Comedy
","Listen I know how it is. Sometimes when you go out to the movies you wanna laugh. Sometimes you wanna watch two nice people fall in love, and if you're like me you wanna watch zombies rip people apart. But sometimes when you go to the movies don't you just long to see a romantic comedy in which Zombies rip people apart? Fear not reader, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is the film for you.<br/><br/>SHAUN OF THE DEAD follows our hero Shaun (Simon Pegg, 24 Hour Party People) on journey to win back his girl Liz (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office), make amends with his Mom (Nicola Cunningham), and to fight off a small London Suburb of Zombies. Shaun enlists the help of his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost, TV's SPACED), and Dianne (Lucy Davis, TV's The Office) and David (Dylan Moran, Notting Hill) Liz's two best friends, who don't seem to like Shaun Very Much, but they follow him anyway cause Liz follows Shaun. It's all very complicated but once you let the characters take hold, this film is a trip.<br/><br/>Director Edgar Wright (TV's Spaced) has crafted a silly and yet surprisingly rich film. Full of characters worth rooting for, gore that harkens back to a simpler time when it was okay to disembowel in horror flicks, and conflicts that enlighten our characters with humanity. It's a film about how mundane and Zombie-like our lives are, and about our search for that hero inside. But more importantly the film is about being funny. Laugh out loud, gutt-busting, funny.<br/><br/>Pegg's Shaun hits the right chords as a guy who wants more out of his life, but is drawn back into his slacker existence because he doesn't know any better. He's every Tom, Dick, and Harry who looks at themselves 10 years after graduating from college and wondering, 'how did I get here?' That's easy he's been sticking up for a buddy who has as much drive as a broken down Ford Pinto and that's what makes him a great hero, he's empathetic to a fault.<br/><br/>But most are probably wondering what about the Zombies. SHAUN OF THE DEAD works because the screenplay loves the material. As screenwriter's as well,<br/><br/>Pegg and Wright don't allow the material to become mean spirited. They love the Zombie movie. I'll bet they sat up many late nights watching NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD over and over. There's even a small wink at 28 DAYS LATER won't fall on deaf ears. They know the material well and walk the thin line between spoof and homage, to a nice degree.<br/><br/>The best scene in the film concerns one characters death, by being bitten by a Zombie. Nobody wants to shoot that character (who will eventually become one of the undead) and they're torn on both sides. A showdown of broken bottles and a corkscrew, tests the characters will, and in the end brings them closer together. The scene works because there is real tension. Although this is a comedy, these characters are in peril. It was exhilarating.<br/><br/>The film's only major flaw is that it takes far too long to get started. The first twenty minutes drag on like they were being paid by the minute. The laughs at the beginning seemed to be forced and if I'd left before the Zombies begin to show up I might have panned the movie as boring. But once the Zombies show up the film comes to life with really good laughs, and even a few good scares chucked in for measure. SHAUN OF THE DEAD would have done well to have had the early moments of the film re-imagined or shaved a little. But I'll forgive the film this one small flaw. I really liked it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though the most surprising thing about SHAUN OF THE DEAD is what its not. It's not a Horror film. It's a Romantic Comedy, turned on its head and it works almost flawlessly. In fact my wife called it 'FORCES OF NATURE with Zombies (instead of weather).' I don't know if I'd go that far but I will agree that there is a little romance for the lady in your life. <br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little different, if you're looking for a silly movie with heart, or you like to watch people get ripped apart limb from limb. SHAUN OF THE DEAD does not disappoint, I promise you'll like it.<br/><br/>****1/2 (out of 5)"

The firs 3/4th of this film is excellent. I laughed out loud several times.<br/><br/>But when they are baracaded in the Tavern - it is legitimately about 15-20 minutes TOO MUCH. The laughter slows to a trickle.<br/><br/>The ending is good. So you have a great flick and a good ending sandwiching 15 minutes of blandness. Not bad for a film these days though. I give Shaun a 6.

","Shaun of the Dead has its moments. If you have ever seen the television series Spaced, there are several parodies between the series and this film. (Of course, as the title suggests, it parodies the old zombie horror films.) It's worth a trip to the cinema to see it for the sake of seeing it, and it has a dozen laughs or so. However, I feel that the film loses the appeal toward the last 40 minutes of the film. This is when it turns more horror and less comedy; it seems as though they wanted to wrap it up quickly all at once. I recommend it for the social/society jokes and parody humor that made the series Spaced brilliant. If you are in need of a laugh, I would recommend this film for its light humor. I rate it 5/10."

It's well done, with a talented cast, direction, photography and lighting, but it's nothing new.<br/><br/>The zombie sequences are well done, in a classic style that shouldn't disappoint those looking for homages and clichés.

What a waste of £14.<br/><br/>The story goes that Shaun is a bum in a crap relationship and has a fat friend and a step father whom he hates. Suddenly, zombies. No reason for them being there, they just arrive. It makes as little sense as the big twist at the end of Scream. The rest of the plot is so formulaic and predictable - his mother is obviously going to become a zombie, that annoying prick boyfriend guy is gonna die but you won't care, he'll get the girl back, the fat guy will try to be funny by being fat and a comic relief character. They decide to round themselves up and barricade up in the pub.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie that raised a chuckle is when Shaun tries to vault over a garden fence, which collapses... but save your money, you can see this in the 30 second preview.<br/><br/>Each character is as 1 dimensional as a Mr Man.

It's funny, and filled with a serious amount of disaster and mayhem. <br/><br/>I personally love all of the characters in this film. It's just like the movie Zombieland to me, but less serious. Having the main characters as two stoners just adds to the greatness of this film. They have this I don't give half of a s*it attitude, and they're just naturally funny in this zombie situation. I love how the zombies move so slow. That just adds to the comedic value of the film to. They have enough time to go inside and grab a collection of vinyl records, come back outside, and target practice on the zombies heads before they move 10 feet. I laughed so hard. The quirky moments in this movie will brighten up anyone's bad day. <br/><br/>Throughout this whole fun filled film, Shaun just keeps getting crapped on to. His job sucks, his girlfriend Liz leaves him, his best friend lives with him and he's a moron, so on and so forth. It's all part of the comedy. Just his stupid reaction to things. Him and his buddy also have an obsession with this pub called the Winchester. <br/><br/>This film's dialog is very well done. It will have you laughing, and glad you watched the film in no time flat. I think this film is one parody that can be enjoyed by anyone. I would definitely recommend this film to others if they're in the mood to laugh."
"daytona-45586","8","2","6","13 December 2015"," A great cross genre comedy zombie movie!
","Shaun of the Dead is a coming of age movie, set inside of a zombie apocalypse, with a heavy comedic undertone. The film does not exactly following the guidelines for a traditional horror or comedy film, and that is in no small part what makes the film worthwhile. The mashing of genres, while still staying the path of a theme in which the main character is learning about himself and getting some direction in his life, makes this film appealing for many different audiences.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg stars as Shaun, a man who has grown into adulthood with no direction and not much going for him. He has a job at a small store where he commands almost no respect. He lives with two friends, Ed, played by Nick Frost, and Pete. Ed has even less direction than Shaun, and spends the majority of his time playing video games or drinking with Shaun at their favorite pub, The Winchester. Pete sees both Shaun and Ed for the men that they are, and calls Shaun out for it early in the movie.<br/><br/>Shaun's troubles do not end with his work or roommates. Shaun has a less than ideal relationship with his mother, mainly because of his step-father with whom he has a very strained relationship. Shaun is also on the verge of losing his girlfriend, Liz, who is played by Kate Ashfield. After a last straw, Liz calls quits to their relationship, and Shaun ends up drinking with Ed at The Winchester. The next morning, Shaun and Ed wake up to a zombie outbreak which is taking over their town. Shaun and Ed devise a plan to rescue Shaun's mother, now ex-girlfriend Liz, and make their way to The Winchester to wait out the catastrophe.<br/><br/>The explanation of how they plan to save the day is done through a montage of scenes that show the group, under ideal circumstances, rescued and enjoying beer while waiting for a solution. The comedy used in the montage is similar to that of another zombie-comedy movie, Zombieland. These montages add to the comedic element of the film, showing perceived comical events from a third person point of view outside of the character's own.<br/><br/>Shaun's first chance to begin to change his ways and show he is growing up happens as soon as he rescues his mother and step- father, Phillip, Liz, and her roommates. Phillip has been bitten by one of the zombies and is going to die. Shaun is able to reconcile with Phillip before his passing and ultimate reanimation as a zombie. He is seen shedding tears for Phillip, and has to break the news to his mother, showing he is ready to start taking some responsibility.<br/><br/>Later, after making some more laughable, yet poor choices, the group finally makes it to The Winchester, where they decide to hold out. Once there, the daylight fades to night, and the lighting used to convey the scene is noticeably darker than the remainder of the film. This is likely used to help the audience anticipate the coming tragedies of the film, since the movie is a comedy as well and is not meant to shock the viewer like a true horror film. Shortly after dark, and due to more hilarity on the part of Ed, Liz's roommates are lost to the zombie hoard, and Ed is also bitten. The remaining three find their way to the basement, ready to call it quits and contemplating suicide, when an escape through a freight elevator is discovered. Since Ed is already infected and going to die, he decides to stay behind. This is also another turning point for Shaun, who has had Ed has his safety net and companion while making nothing of themselves. Shaun has to say goodbye to his friend, and take control to try to save himself and Liz. Once in the street, the two are rescued by the military. The scene reopens a few months later, and it is learned that the zombie outbreak has not only been controlled, but the zombie are being used as labor for the survivors. Shaun and Liz have moved in together, and Shaun seems to have found his feet and trying to make something of himself. In the last scene, Shaun is walking out to the shed, where it is discovered that zombie Ed is still around, kept there by Shaun where they play video games and still enjoy each other's company.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is very enjoyable strictly for entertainment value, but still follows a coming of age theme for a viewer who may be looking for a deeper meaning or value within the film. The comedy makes it light-hearted and easy to follow, and plays very well in today's zombie obsessed industry. This is a must watch for anyone looking for a fun movie that does not require a lot of emotional investment or thought."

"TheLittleSongbird","9","2","6","24 May 2010"," Funny and really entertaining, even if it is a one-joke concept it is one that works
","I thought that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be my style, I seriously thought I would hate it. But no...I loved it. Some parts do drag, especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going, but I loved the film's deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror. If you love blood and gore, you have found your match with Shaun of the Dead, and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match. The cinematography is innovative and unique, the music just adds to the atmosphere, the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast, Simon Pegg is just wonderful, and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip. Overall, just a great film, although it is a one-joke concept it actually works. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"MovieAddict2016","10","2","6","5 July 2006"," The best zombie movie ever - because it's more than just a zombie movie.
","Zombies are boring. They're not scary, they're not intimidating. They move slower than a snail, and all they can do is eat you. I suppose in the early days there was more of a thrill to them, but that was lost as the years progressed. George A. Romero captured the fear in his original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and used the zombies as satire of American commercialism in his overrated sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but by the time his third film came around  the forgettable ""Day of the Dead""  the zombie genre had been ruined by the outpour of Romero rip-offs, all of which lacked the brains of his first two movies.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" understands how lame zombies are. No one responds to the monsters. People carry on as if it's just a bad day or something, and tomorrow everything will be back to normal. When Shaun (Simon Pegg) runs through a crowd of the undead and swings a cricket bat at them, totally unfazed by their presence, it's one of the film's cleverer scenes. Because director Edgar Wright and writer Pegg know zombies and zombie movies suck.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" is the best modern zombie movie ever. It's the funniest, most entertaining, most emotionally captivating and, surprisingly, one of the darkest, too (lots of blood was used here).<br/><br/>Pegg plays Shaun, a down-on-his-luck Brit who lives with his friend Ed (Nick Frost) and is about to be dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield). When the zombies begin to attack, Shaun immediately uses their presence as a way to scheme his way back into his girlfriend's heart. It's the perfect excuse for him to go over to her apartment.<br/><br/>There's more heart and understanding of the human condition in this movie than most dramas. It carefully balances the physical pain with the heartache  Shaun's cruel stepdad (the always reliable Bill Nighy) gets bitten by a zombie, and as he bleeds to death, he apologizes to Shaun for his behavior over the years and explains that all he ever wanted was to be accepted as a father figure. It's a touching scene at a totally unexpected place in the movie, and makes the zombie attacks more than just random acts of comedy punctuated by blood-letting  it makes them human.<br/><br/>This is a romantic comedy about forgiveness, broken relationships, estranged parents, accepting your best friend's flaws, recognizing your own, andzombies. What a concept."
"maddymoo","6","2","6","6 November 2005"," zombies ahoy
","As a rule I like the zombie genre, regardless of how classy or trashy the finished product is (according to popular opinion). I found this one a bit ho-hum, unfortunately. Yes, a different angle to the usual, but it must it always rain in zombie movies? The ending, at least, was non-standard, and actually funny.<br/><br/>I liked Barbara. I found the other characters annoying. I suppose they were meant to be annoying (to various degrees), but I found myself wishing they'd all succumb to zombie-ness and get it over with.<br/><br/>I liked the fart joke. I liked the quick sequences outlining what they intended to do (kill Philip, rescue Barbara etc). I liked a couple of other bits, but most of it was painful for me. Now on my list of ""films to avoid""."
"TheMovieMark","Null","2","6","24 September 2004"," Overrated. Over-hyped. Underwhelming.
","I haven't seen a movie fail to live up to the hype this much since The Blair Witch Project. Remember how it was supposed to be the scariest movie of all time? Then do you remember sitting in the theater cheering for the witch to kill off the three crybabies who kept fussing over a stupid map?<br/><br/>Well, if you go into Shaun of the Dead expecting one of the funniest movies of the year and a masterpiece in the spoof genre, then you're going to be very disappointed as you stare at the screen and wonder when the humor will start. Please don't believe any of the reviewers claiming it's ""a laugh-a-minute."" The only way that would be possible is if you're referring to the trailer. It took almost 30 minutes before the FIRST laugh ever came.<br/><br/>That's not an exaggeration. About the first 30 minutes of the story are spent showing us how much of a slacker Shaun is and how irresponsible he is in his relationship with Liz. I guess this is all supposed to make us like him more when he decides to save Liz and everybody around him from the zombies. Doesn't work. I was just sitting there bored out of my mind waiting for something, anything to happen.<br/><br/>The best I can possibly say about this movie is it's merely OK. I think a viewer's enjoyment will be largely based on his perception going into the movie. After watching the trailer, I was expecting an all-out comedy/parody. And there are a few funny moments (for example, Shaun and his friend act somewhat nonchalantly towards the zombies at first as they use cricket bats and old LPs to do battle), but most of the humor can be found in the trailer.<br/><br/>The main problem with Shaun of the Dead is it has major identity conflict. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It spoofs the zombie genre for a bit, but then we have to sit through emotional moments that put a damper on everything. I thought this was supposed to be a comedy, so why do I have to sit through a scene with Shaun crying while trying to make decisions about what to do to certain people who have turned into zombies?<br/><br/>And then you have some pretty graphic moments that make it seem like the movie wants to have a legitimate horror movie feel. This doesn't work because the movie isn't the least bit scary. The result is the movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. For that reason, I think the mainstream American audience won't connect with it.<br/><br/>The people this will connect with the most are the coffeehouse artsy types who'll love discussing the social commentary. But for me, the social commentary is about as effective as shaving with a rubber band. Exactly. Way too much time is dedicated to trying to show us that we all live zombie-like lives. We sit glaze-eyed in front of the TV playing video games, we all follow our own little cliques, we head to work in the same routine every day. Yeah, that's great. You could've expressed that point in a single sentence.<br/><br/>There are a handful of funny and clever moments (particularly the end), but I would've liked to have seen more ""shock value"" moments played for laughs. Unfortunately, Shaun of the Dead looks to be throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. Plus, the film makers are apparently in love with repetition. I hear the wedding is in April. For example, the camera pans up from someone's feet as he stumbles about. We see the figure yawning and making a weird sound. Oh, it's Shaun. Look, he's acting like a zombie! How cute. Apparently a critic somewhere must've laughed insanely during a press screening, so they decided it'd be great to repeat this gag. ONCE WAS ENOUGH!<br/><br/>And please don't tell me I just don't understand British humor. Folks, I get the joke, it just ain't that funny. If this is the best the British have to offer these days in regard to comedy, then I've never been prouder to be an American. <br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>I have no desire to see this again, and I certainly won't recommend it. If you're looking for some good British comedy then I highly recommend checking out John Cleese's Fawlty Towers. But if you're in the mood to chuckle once or twice during a movie and then fight the temptation to fall asleep, then Shaun of the Dead will fill that bill. Let me put it as bluntly as I possibly can: Don't believe the hype."
"dung_rat","4","2","6","26 April 2004"," Sadly disappointing...*mild spoilers*
","After waiting with baited breath for this film to surface I finally made it to the cinema yesterday to see it. The British Nationals have been going crazy for this film. Needless to say being a 'Spaced' fan and a (HUGE!) zombie-flick fan I had very high expectations for this film.<br/><br/>It is with regret, however, that I'm not rating this film nearly as high as I wanted to...which is a shame. Yes, potentially, the concept sounded extremely promising - Simon Pegg is a very intelligent and witty guy and his work on 'Spaced' and 'Big Train' was superb.<br/><br/>It just failed to raise any serious humour in my eyes that was so evident in Pegg's other (and earlier) work. I know many people would have seen this film with preconceptions of his style and humour but, for me, Shaun's humour lacked a fair deal of subtlety and the gags were few and far between. Coupled with the more 'serious' element behind the film - like losing your best friend and having to kill your own mother (!!) - the film becomes a mixed affair that isn't quite as light-hearted as one would imagine.<br/><br/>
There's a fulfilling amount of gore to keep some of the horror-fans satisfied and the fan-boys among us will no doubt pick up on some of the more subtle allusions to the horror genre. There were also a couple of shock moments which were successfully done but overall it seemed to be carrying a few too many flaws and it's positioning between horror, comedy, rom-com and satire seems so tightly interwoven that it becomes a muddled affair whereby it doesn't know it it's truly coming or going. <br/><br/>In closing - good special effects for the zombies, good soundtrack, Bill Nighy, some nice cameo roles, some mildly funny slapstick moments but sadly could have been considerably better. 5/10"

An already excellent film that is infinitely better if you were part of the Spaced movement, which I was.

"mtrburrows","10","1","2","29 July 2019"," An underrated masterpiece
","The fact that Shaun of the Dead has gone largely unnoticed by the masses is the biggest sin in the world of cinema to this day. Shaun of the Dead is renowned director Edgar Wright's best film to date - his passion of storytelling, intricate detailing, exciting direction, character building, world building, everything is at its most apparent here.<br/><br/>I think I've seen Shaun of the Dead more than any other movie and I still find things in it that I failed to see on the other viewings every time. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's screenplay is nothing short of masterful and quite simply one of the best screenplays of all time. Nearly every line of dialogue, every shot, every action, acts as foreshadowing, or as part of a before/after structure that shows character growth and story progression. Every second of film here is put to good use, and there isn't a hair or screen-time you could remove - everything is made integral in the most tight-nit story I've seen to this day. Edgar Wright's direction makes everything fun and entertaining, from his visual comedy, to adding flare to the most mundane tasks such as making toast and tea.<br/><br/>Not to mention, every character is superbly written to be consistent and show growth, or provide the tools for growth in the other characters. Shaun has to be in my top 50 protagonists of all time for being incredibly relateable, likeable, and proactive even while being an Everyman. The performances help so much too, with Nick frost being the standout as he makes a character that could easily be annoying if not played right a charming and hilarious addition to the cast. These aren't your usual zombie movie stereotypes, there are characters the film makes you care and root for.<br/><br/>Speaking of the zombie genre, I believe this film is the best example of how to do a spoof of a genre, as while conventions are somewhat mocked and poked fun at, the story is still intense, the characters are human beings and not over the top caricatures, and most of all the threat is still very real - I first saw this film when I was 7 and some of the zombie moments haunted me for a couple years before I was brave enough to watch it again.<br/><br/>Charming, indescribably clever, and just simply a masterpiece - Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg deserve ALL the oscars for this triumph of film."

You can never tell whether or not, let alone when, to take them seriously. Or not.<br/><br/>There are parts in Shaun of the Dead that were really horrifying. Disturbing, even. There are parts that contain very serious drama and emotional moments with enough impact that they are hard to forget and leave me with knots in my stomach in a way that few actual horror flicks manage to pull off. Then there are moments of wry humor so expertly executed and so delightfully irreverent that this is easily one of the most quotable and ridiculous movies of the last few years.

","The main plot is that ""Enders"" get embroiled in apocalyptic London. The soap opera points are played for laughs, as is most of the film.<br/><br/>The soap opera itself is too underplayed to make a suitable impact, and therefore the pathos is mainly of comedic nature, which unfortunately does not engender sympathy for mostly unlikeable characters, except Simon Pegg's. Yes, even ""Ed"" hasn't enough depth to bring him alive, and therefore his end is rather benign, heroics notwithstanding. The one poignant scene is the stepfather telling the stepson how much he is loved.<br/><br/>As for the zombie portion of the film, there are a few gruesome scenes which will keep any hardcore fan nodding lethargically, but there are some real issues with continuity and/or the arrow of time. For example, in the bar, the windows are smashed out and the zombies are comin' in, but a few minutes later the windows are NOT smashed out and the zombies are back out again. A serious error. When the rifle is utilized, it is shot from longer range rather than point blank; but if Simon is brave enough to use a sticky wicket or other handy instrument (a running gag), why not get closer with the firearm? Curious.<br/><br/>The star of the film is Simon Pegg, and he IS worth the price of admission. Cool under fire from some bad scriptwriting and various staging problems, he rises above to create a character worth watching. His comic timing has never been better, and in effect he drags UP the other actors, who otherwise would bore.<br/><br/>The other star is the swift editing, which is a nod to Sam Raimi, as is the line ""Join us."" Speaking of lines, Night of the Living Dead gets at least one obvious smile-bringing reference.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film is slightly ordinary, having a somewhat-tense waiting period at the start, with media clues in the background of daily life building to the inevitable, a hackneyed caught-in-the-structure sequence, and a catch-all ending, before the surprise one-off punchline. For sheer chutzpah, Return of the Living Dead did it better, and Evil Dead 2 is the king of absurdity while still maintaining complexity and chills. Shaun of the Dead has a place in the canon, but not as high as Dawn of the Dead or Zombieland, because this is, after all, Cheech and Chong Meets the Living Dead."

","'Shaun of the Dead' is a romantic zombie comedy and one of the first films of Edgar Wright. This British film shot in 2004. Actors who are starring in this film are Simon Pegg and Nick Frost well-known by films like 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Paul'. Release date is 9 April 2004. The protagonist, Shaun Riley, is a 29-years-old manager at an electronics store. His employees don't respect, he can't make relationship with the girl and her friends condemn his lifestyle. He, standing in line at the bus stop at the supermarket on the way home from work like usual man, strongly resembles zombie. Shaun is an ordinary man. But while Shaun was thinking about his gap with the girl there was a real apocalypse in the world! The first extraordinary thing he saw was a woman standing with a stick protruding from her belly! Comedy mixes very closely with a horror. The film features the director's good work and very convincing cast. Although there are few feeble jokes this film will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the production. This is phenomenally funny scary film you would have ever seen. I think that this film is fabulous in all respects. If you want to watch a good comedy, see a wonderful cast and have a great mood for a long time this film is your choice."

","Shaun loves his dead-end existence of wasting his days at the Winchester, a local pub, with his friend and flat mate Ed (Nick Frost). The film's money shot arrives about 20 minutes in, when Shaun, hungover from a hard night's drinking, goes to the store and because he's so hungover and is worried about his ex-girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), he doesn't even notice that the street behind him is teeming with the living dead.<br/><br/>While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.<br/><br/>Straight from Britain, we have what is certainly one of the most original horror movies to come out in a long time. Even in a genre that embraces gore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is fairly light on it (at least for the first 45 minutes) and is dominated by laughs galore.<br/><br/>You may remember the character of ""Ash"" (Bruce Campbell of ""Evil Dead"" fame), who has remained pretty much the supreme demon slayer in the horror genre. But you know, Campbell's pushed past 40 and people today may not be weary of his history slaying evil Deadites in Sam Raimi's notorious film series. So maybe with ""Shaun of the Dead,"" the torch has been passed to Simon Pegg, who slays more than his fair share of the living dead in this film.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that ""SOTD"" was greatly influenced by the works of George A. Romero (the director of 1978's supreme epic of zombie action- mayhem ""Dawn of the Dead"") and 2002's ""28 Days Later"" (directed by Danny Boyle). There are little itty-bitty references to the two zombie flicks throughout the movie."
"tjsdshpnd","7","1","2","3 January 2010"," A Strictly one time watch
","Comedies have various sub-forms or sub-branches as in Rom Com, Spoof Comedies, Sci Fi Comedies etc. After watching this movie, I got in touch with a new branch of comedy called as the 'Zom Com' or Zombie Comedy. It is horror in the garb of comedy consisting of real horrific zombies but the whole situation is handled with a comic touch. The protagonist of the movie Shaun is a loser who lives with his good for nothing friend Ed and 'prick' Pete who is a practical guy. His relationship with his girlfriend Liz is on the docks and on the verge of breaking. He hates his step-dad and his juniors at work don't respect him. One fine day he decides to make things right in his life. Sadly, the day he chooses is the same day when the Zombies decide to attack Planet Earth. Now, his focus is to save his near and dear ones from becoming Zombies and in the process, mend his life. Is he successful in his conquest and if yes at what price constitutes the movie.<br/><br/>Story is fine, the comedy is provided through witty dialogues and some great acting. The beheading and mutilation of the Zombies looks amusing as well as comic initially. But after sometime , it becomes a little boring. The movie moves towards a predictable end and the viewer ends up thinking, 'Damn, there was something missing'. The movie is rated very highly in many online movie portals, but if you ask my opinion, the movie was pretty average. Overall, a strictly one time watch.<br/><br/>Rating : 7/10"
"tatmeister","6","1","2","2 February 2008"," Not as good as sequel, Hot Fuzz, and a bit dull
","I watched ""Hot Fuzz"" before this movie. Watching ""Hot Fuzz"" made me want to see this movie really bad. I loved ""Hot Fuzz""'s original style of humor (British comedy !!!) and its great acting, along with intricate plot. The camera work from Wright was different from any American films I've ever seen and made the film much more comedic and hilarious, and not stuck in 'one situation.' Hot Fuzz was one of my favorite movies of 2007. But when I watched ""shaun of the dead"" I was not laughing, and the plot did not get me involved in the movie either. The jokes were lack-luster compared to ""Hot Fuzz"". Much of the comedy doesn't fit in. The acting is what got me through the movie, the expressions on the main character (Shaun)'s face actually had me laughing more than the jokes themselves. Watch this movie for the acting, not the jokes and plot/acting (there really is not a plot) but if you don't like this movie watch ""Hot Fuzz"", you'll definitely be laughing at that."
"MLDinTN","7","1","2","28 July 2005"," an amusing slightly bloody Brithish spoof
","This basically follows the guidelines for other zombie films. Once bitten you turn into a zombie. But this one is for laughs. The zombies move slow and have weird looks on their faces and moan in a silly way. Our heroes, Shaun and Ed don't seem to notice the chaos going around until they get up one morning. In one funny scene, Shaun goes to the store to get his usual drink and doesn't notice blood on the door or people dead in allies. The two spot a zombie in the yard and turn on the TV and find out what's going on. They try to bash the zombie's head in a series of funny events. They contrive a plan to pick up Shaun's mom, girlfriend, and head over the local pub. So, we get more silly zombie encounters. When the step-dad turns, they just leave him in the car instead of kicking him out and taking the car. But it doesn't matter because the zombies are too slow. They make it to the pub and there is a fast conclusion just when you think they have no where left to run.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Comical horror spoof, much better than the Scary Movie spoofs. I recommend this for anyone who can't miss a zombie film."

Of course, it helps if one has an idea how British humour works.<br/><br/>I bought the DVD, and can safely say it's a ""keeper"", and a movie I will be watching again and again.<br/><br/>Of course, I wish I didn't read all the ""mistakes"" that were found in the movie; Who cares, as long as it doesn't affect the plot!!!

It's bloody and gory at times, but mostly funny. This work of masterpiece is full of great quotes! I guess everyone has their own opinion, but I seriously don't understand the people who don't like this movie...I don't see HOW you can't like it.

"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","2","26 June 2005"," Good British horror satire
","If you appreciate tongue-in-cheek humor in horror films, British movies, and well drawn characters you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>This film is really a love story between Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Liz (Kate Ashfield). Shaun is going nowhere fast as a temporary manager in an electronics store. Liz is his long time girlfriend who has just dumped him because his idea of a date is to spend time at the Winchester Pub. Shaun has two roommates. His mum is remarried and Shaun dislikes his step-dad. Shaun also has an ex. Shaun is a zero and his life is going nowhere. When the zombies appear Shaun gets his chance to lead.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg does a good job as Shaun. He is unknown to US audiences having worked mostly in British TV series. But it is Nick Frost who steals the movie as Ed the lovable, slobby, somewhat dimwitted roommate. Kate Ashfield is also good as Liz. Look for Bill Nighy as the step-dad (burned out rock star Billy Mack in Love Actually.) Some of the ways in which the zombies are defended against are funny, including a cricket bat and Ed's record collection. As a horror movie it's fairly tame, not at all like the Evil Dead or Day of the Dead. There are a few gory scenes but they aren't excessive. In fact, if those scenes were cut this could probably play on British TV. The special effects are simple, understated but just right.

"KnightLander","8","1","2","20 June 2005"," ""Shaun"" is anything but dead; one of the best films in recent years
","Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of horror-comedies. I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions? Fear and happiness. Horror-comedies mix these two elements, and if done correctly - which is no easy feat - you can have one darn fine movie. And ""Shaun of the Dead"" is just that. I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U.S. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg (who has gained some popularity overseas for performing in the British TV show ""Spaced"") stars as Shaun, a 30-year-old Brit who is stock with a crappy job and a crappy stepfather (Bill Nighy), among other things. Then there's his slacker best friend, Ed (Nick Frost). When his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumbs Shaun, it looks like his life has taken the final step towards hell.<br/><br/>But Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepfather. How? Simple: he just has to defend them all against a neighborhood full of zombies.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of movies like ""Evil Dead II"", ""Re-Animator"", and George Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy. As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love ""Shaun of the Dead"". The script, by Edgar Wright and star Pegg, knows when to bring in some comedy and when to let loose the horror. (When it does bring in horror, the casual moviegoer's stomach will no doubt flip - ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?) <br/><br/>The cast is terrific, Pegg especially. You care about the characters, and the only one who I didn't care about was ... uh ... dealt with. Edgar Wright manages to make the film look like a comedy when there's something funny going on, but when there's any horror (especially towards the end of the film), his direction becomes quite dark.<br/><br/>What can I say? This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror-comedy in years. I was entertained throughout the entire film. Hilarious and absorbing, ""Shaun"" is anything but dead."
"Pedro_H","8","1","2","13 June 2005"," Low budget Brit horror-satire which works better than you might expect.
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a slacker manager of a small London electrical store whose domestic life of old sofas, drink and video games leads him to lose his blonde girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). Can an unexplained plague of zombies be the catalyst for winning her back?<br/><br/>A rare British comedy that was a hit both sides of the Atlantic - although it is one of those movies that you feel like you have watched after the 3 min trailer! <br/><br/>There are some movies that have the word ""cult"" written all over them from the opening scenes - this is one such case. Indeed this is a wonderful example of what you can do with a low budget and some good comedy performances, movie references and a couple of sets.<br/><br/>The concept is simple: Slackers have the chance to redeem themselves through outrageous circumstances and people that we/they don't like get the rough end of poetic justice. Hardly original, but very much tried and tested.<br/><br/>Strangely for a comedy this doesn't have a ton of laughs in it (more guffaws really) and often relies on uses of bizarre devices to get out of difficult situations: Cricket bat, shot gun, Prince records, etc.<br/><br/>Like many comedies you actually like, there isn't a lot to it. Set up, problem, problem solved (or not solved). Take the zombie element out and you could run this as a rom-com about relationships. This is no surprise as the writers have been brought up on it.<br/><br/>The in-jokes fly and while most are featured in the trivia column there are one or two that I spotted that are not present: The monkey impression gag comes from Pegg's sketch show past (We Know Where You live) where if silence reigned he would get up on the table and impersonate a monkey! <br/><br/>(You had to see it to understand.)<br/><br/>The greatest victory for Shaun of the Dead is that it injects some pace and drive in to the thing.They have learnt from Guy Richie about doing flash-pans,fantasy (that you think is real), double/treble takes (plan one, plan two, reality).<br/><br/>The best thing about it is that it knows how long it can stay on the screen and how long you can string it out. Let us cheer a movie that has plenty of black comedy moments and knows when to sit down and let the credits play."

"InaneSwine","9","1","2","11 June 2005"," The Best Zombie Movie Ever Made
","It may well be a one-joke movie, but this hysterical spoof of Dawn of the Dead manages to stretch that joke a very long way. Relocating the story to North London, it presents a lovelorn shop assistant (Simon Pegg) and his slovenly flatmate (Nick Frost) with the task of battling an invasion of cannibal zombies.<br/><br/>Attempting to blend horror with comedy is no simple task, but director Edgar Wright keeps both the gore and the laughs flowing freely. If the film revels in its sheer goofiness - such as the moment two protagonists attempt to stop a shambling zombie by throwing vinyl records at it - it also has moments that verge on the sublime, such as one character's description of the living dead as ""Vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet."" This film is not a gross-out spoof such as ""Scary Movie"", but it will have you laughing, screaming and will keep you on the edge of your seat."

My favorite character perhaps was Ed (Nick Frost) whose part is just pull of hilarious things to say.<br/><br/>The plot, like a lot of zombie movies, the dead just end up walking the earth with no clear explanation. Shaun and Ed realize this, go to save his ex-girlfriend(Liz), Shaun's mom, his step-dad(Phil), and Liz's friends, together they venture to seek shelter in a bar, and the zombies end up breaking in and killing everybody along the way, except for Liz and Shaun (Well Ed is actually turned into a zombie, and is later kept in Shaun's shed), the national guard later kills off most of the zombies and Liz and Shaun live happily ever after. *and if you've seen the DVD extras Liz's friend doesn't actually die (only her boyfriend).

","I rarely catch standard (non-SciFi/Space Opera) movies at the theater, preferring to catch them on video some time later, and I just watched Shaun of the Dead last weekend. I'd heard good things about it, and was looking forward to seeing it.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Some of the humor may be a bit British-centric, but overall the movie translated very well to the States, as I think there are a lot more ""Shauns"" and ""Eds"" over here than our TV shows or movies might lead one to believe.<br/><br/>The fact that ""Shaun of the Dead"" combines so many elements (comedy, horror, drama) may confuse some Americans who have grown too used to one dimensional plots and characters in our movies (thank you, Hollywierd), but overall I think plenty of Americans ""get"" this movie quite well.<br/><br/>And for my money, it was one of the better movies I'd seen in a very long time. I'd just seen Revenge of the Sith the day before (during which I checked my watch several times and almost nodded off), yet I scarcely budged during Shaun of the Dead, and immediately watched the movie again, looking for more details the second time around (one of the reasons I like video better than theater), and found that I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead better on second viewing.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd consider Shaun of the Dead an excellent comedy, liberally sprinkled throughout with romance, horror, and dramatic elements in a very workable (and watchable) fusion of fun, pints, peanuts, Winchesters, mothers, and the odd zombie."

"eddie-177","8","1","2","1 June 2005"," Excellence in originality
","I'm still reeling after wasting 9.50 to see that god-awful remake of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" which soiled not only the good name of the original movie-which is, for my money, the most frightening American horror film ever made-but the reputation of Mr. Ed Gein. That affront to Mr. Gein's good name was the straw that broke the camel's back: After sitting through the horrible likes of ""House of a 1000 Corpses,"" ""House on Haunted Hill,"" ""House of the Dead,"" and ""House IV,"" I had finally accepted the fact that horror peaked in the 1970s and that any scary movie made for a large American audience these days was going to be nothing but crap.<br/><br/>And that's what the trailers for ""Shaun of the Dead"" made it look like: a retarded, platitude-filled mess of awful humor. What's worse, every review I came across (granted, I didn't read them too carefully) made sure to mention in the first sentence or two that this was a ""parody"" of zombie films. Goody, I thought, the British version of ""Scary Movie 3."" There was no way in hell that I was going to watch it.<br/><br/>But then I was lucky enough to catch a few episodes of the British comedy ""Spaced"" on Trio one evening, and I loved it. During commercial breaks the announcer was sure to mention that the people who made ""Spaced"" had also made Shaun of the Dead, and then they'd show the trailer for the film. This confused me. How could the makers of such an original, funny program be responsible for what looked like a horrible film? Could it--could it be that TV was lying to me? Or was the distributor of this film somehow trying to dumb down its image to make it more palatable to the simple tastes of American middle-schoolers, that all-important demographic that 99.9% of all Hollywood films made in the last five years have been geared towards? It was all too confusing; I had to find solace in drink. When I woke up there was a copy of Shaun of the Dead on DVD lying next to me. I popped it in and was blown away.<br/><br/>The humor is original. I cannot stress that enough, as I cannot remember the last time I saw anything bordering on original humor in a horror film. The plot may be middle of the road but it's saved by its refusal to stick to the usual zombie film contrivances in which five of ten character archetypes (tough guy, sissy guy, sassy black woman, et cetera) are pitted against zombies in one of three different situations.<br/><br/>Even if the plot for Shaun of the Dead were as clichéd and moronic as ""House of Wax,"" the characters would have made it an enjoyable film. They don't stick to pre-determined roles (aside from Dylan Moran's David), and are actually well-rounded and *gasp* charming. The gory special effects are wondrous, the pacing is great, and the Spaced-like cinematography transfers perfectly to the big screen.<br/><br/>My sole complaint is with the character David, played by ""Black Book's"" Dylan Moran. Moran's Bernard Black, a surly alcoholic who owns a bookstore, is one of the funniest characters I've seen imported to America in years. Moran's talent is wasted as the 2-dimensional foil to Simon Pegg's incredibly likable Shaun; he does a tired job of whining his way through his lines and doesn't garner a single laugh."

I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!<br/><br/>I was very torn up when ed was dying and when they revealed him in the end to be in the shed, i thought it was a very cute ending. <br/><br/>Liz was a good character. she was strong and wasn't the ""weak ex-girlfriend that swoons over the male in the end and is the damsel in distress every 3 seconds."" this, i liked. <br/><br/>THIS MOVIE ROCKS MY SOCKS"

","What a great British mish-mash of fantastic stuff! Haven't had such a laugh in ages. This film is -highly- recommendable. Nevermind if you don't like blood and/or gore - the amount of seriousness in this movie is more or less on par with your standard episode of Tom & Jerry. For once it seems a zombie-flick actually had a budget. There's nothing to complain about in the special effects department, and the visual style of the film is just plain great. If you've seen Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream, and Guy Ritchies Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels you'll probably see some common ground in the visual style - although Shaun of the dead contains nothing of the seriousness of Requiem...<br/><br/>Sure... a few hundred liters of blood... but, it's just plain 'ole fun. 10/10."
"cchase","9","1","2","23 April 2005"," When it comes to the ""RomZomCom"", this movie is DEAD on target!
","Poor Shaun. A twenty-something on the nearer end of 30, he's got a dead-end job at the electronics store where he works, a dead-ending relationship that his pretty (and pretty BORED) girlfriend wants to deep-six, a flat-lining rapport with his doting mum and disapproving stepdad, and various friends, neighbors, acquaintances and the like who are just...DEAD.<br/><br/>No, I take that back. UN-dead.<br/><br/>Like the best and brightest Python skit taken to extremes that would even raise THEIR eyebrows, SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a breath of fresh, fetid air in a genre that's been DYING for a bite of good, solid, comic irony. The truly talented Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun with the right combination of distress and deadpan humor, also co-wrote the script with Edgar Wright, and boy, do they know their movies! Good thing, too, because as so many satirists before them have demonstrated, you have to truly love whatever the issue or thing is that you're poking fun at.<br/><br/>But this is not simply some NAKED GUN or SCARY MOVIE copycat here. The quality that makes the humor/horror/heartbreak chemistry cook, is the realness of the relationships that have been developed between the characters, as well as all the details of their lives which the audience can readily relate to. Going through the daily grind of his life, mired in his own sense of misery and ennui, Shaun barely notices the changes taking place in the world around him as the dead begin to rise and walk, and we all laugh knowingly, because we've all had times when we feel that way, and more often than not.<br/><br/>The social commentary (a nod to George Romero's brilliant worldview presented so effectively in DAWN OF THE DEAD, to which this film pays loving homage) is what elevates SHAUN to a level far beyond the usual gut-munch extrava-GORE-za. And it poses some really interesting questions! Aren't all of us in some ways a lot like Shaun, with aspects of our lives that are just like his? And the people around us, zoned out into their own little worlds the same way we all are. If they died and came back to life as zombies, would we actually notice? If it happened to us, would THEY notice? <br/><br/>But before things get too philosophical, there is so much more to SHAUN that can be appreciated. Besides the outstanding performances from everyone, with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost taking the lead as Our Hero and Ed, his ne'er-do-ANYTHING-well best bud, this movie is damn near flawless script-wise and technically as well. <br/><br/>There is a sequence near the film's beginning done in one continuous take that De Palma would envy, and Hitchcock would be proud of, and if you've seen this movie you know exactly what I'm talking about. What makes it so fascinating and startlingly funny is all the little background details you can spot, which of course Shaun is oblivious to. Even better is the second time around, when the sequence is repeated, but things are VASTLY different. It's so well done, that it may take repeat viewings to pick out everything you missed the previous time.<br/><br/>Well, I have never seen SPACED, and probably won't get the chance unless they show the reruns on BBC America. But if SHAUN is any indication of what the cast of that show is capable of on the usual episode, I'll have to keep an eye on the listings.<br/><br/>But for lovers of horror, the zombie genre, or just a good black comedy with something different to offer, look no further. We were fortunate enough to get a DAWN remake that didn't suck, but if you want to do better than just a movie with ""minimal suckage,"" don't rent this one. BUY IT. That way you can save the money you'd be spending otherwise on repeated rentals, because you WILL be watching this more than once. Trust me."
"mentalcritic","8","1","2","23 April 2005"," One of the funniest satires of the past ten years
","Shaun Of The Dead, depending on how you look at it, is either a satire of the zombie concept itself, or a satire of how Hollywood really seems to fail to get it. The film starts out in an almost quiet, sedate fashion, reminiscent of many a British soap opera. Indeed, when our hero passes by some of the recently reanimated dead, he passes by them with such nonchalance that one has to wonder exactly how soon we would notice if the dead started getting up and eating our neighbours. No explanation is offered for why they start doing so, and I doubt that one is really needed. By now, the zombie concept is so entrenched in imagination that it defies belief that the films people think of when one mentions zombies are not those made by the great George Romero.<br/><br/>Unlike the excerable Resident Evil: Apocalypse, which effectively sent itself up, the comedy in Shaun Of The Dead is subtle, fully intentional, and even well-orchestrated. As in any good zombie film, social normalities are messed with, people's expectations of how their actions will turn out are defied, and more humans are killed by the stupidity of their peers rather than any direct contact with the zombies. As is promised in the theatrical trailers, you will get to see zombies being killed with every household or gardening implement imaginable. Even the old record collection gets a try. By far the funniest moment in the film, however, is the ending, which is where the implication that this film was intended to satirise the commercial film system's inability to understand the zombie concept comes from. I won't spoil it for you, but it will bring to mind images of the attempts to make certain sequels as family-friendly as possible.<br/><br/>Interestingly, product placements are also minimal in this feature. In the ninety-odd minutes it ran for, I could not count a single instance where a product was displayed for no other reason than flashing a logo in the audience's face. Not that having recognisable products in a film is necessarily bad, but after some films in which one can play Guess Which Phone Company Paid For Production, the contrast is nice. Given the minimal budget involved, they wouldn't have needed product placement in order to make a profit. More on that anon.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of zombie films, especially the aforementioned Resident Evil sequel, Shaun Of The Dead uses the 2.35:1 frame very effectively. Shots of zombies being shot in the head are staged very smoothly, and some of the outdoor scenes have a dynamic framing that Leone would admire. Indeed, one would never guess that it only cost four million dollars to make from looking at it. That's almost as impressive in low-budget terms as Mad Max. But what really keeps the film going is the story. Simple and to the point, it gets the horror element going without resorting to the usual big conspiracy ideas that some zombie films sadly trip themselves over. Whoever thought that so much could be made out of a trip from the apartment to the pub, by way of mother's home?<br/><br/>When I think about what kind of score to give Shaun Of The Dead, an eight seems most appropriate. The humour is often culture-specific, and there are only a few outright belly-laugh moments, but it is entertaining from start to finish, unlike many of the recent entries in the genre it is attempting to satirise."
"LivingDog","10","1","2","24 April 2005"," A smashing good time!
","This movie is brilliant because of the many levels of emotions it covers: clever, different, intelligent, fun, moving, sad, hilarious, and thirsty - it made me want a pint! :) Shaun (well played by Simon Pegg) and his best friend, Ed (played hilariously by Nick Frost), are great together. Their chemistry is palpable. Shaun's love interest (a blonde - why are they always blonde?!?) does not do a good job convincing me that she is in love with Shaun. Her two friends accurately portray their relationship and also their relationship to Shaun.<br/><br/>At the same time I loved Shaun's ""Mum"" (played flawlessly by Penelope Wilton) Barbara who was so warm playing the sweet loving mother of her little boy. The entire remaining cast is excellent.<br/><br/>I shouldn't forget all the extras who did such a fine job portraying the zombies. They were very well done with some good old zombie munching going on. 10/10<br/><br/>-Zafoid"
"Corky1984","Null","1","2","21 April 2005"," A stunning film that lives up to all its promise
","Shaun of the Dead is superb. Simple as that. It is clearly targeted at fans of Spaced and university students. It will entertain both. The script is razor sharp and loaded with jokes. Nick Frost excels in particular as Simon Pegg's co-star. Most of the big names from the current crop of British comics make an appearance, if only fleetingly, in a film that is perfectly paced and a joy to watch. There is nothing pretentious about this film, which is refreshing to see in a world of schmaltzy Hollywood blockbusters. There is a good dose of comedy violence, well played out, and adding to the film immensely. Simon Pegg is rapidly becoming one of Britain's national treasures. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold. Long may it continue!!!"

Here's hoping there is a Shawn of the Dead II floating around out there (Simon??). I for one will be in line to check it out. Clever camera work and music helped to enhance the mood - if you know what I mean. I would recommend this movie highly - even to casual horror fans. To anyone who loathes Hollywood horror or comedy movies for their lack of creativity will be pleasantly surprised here. Clearly this is a film made outside the umbrella of the ""big studio"" culture."
"captain_bungle","10","1","2","13 April 2005"," Pegg-cellent! Not just all Wright!
","Apologies for the awful summary above...<br/><br/>Shaun is a 29-year-old electrical salesman living in London. He shares a house with two friends and has a steady girlfriend, Liz. Shaun shuffles through life oblivious to events and situations surrounding him, such as his failing relationship and the sudden outbreak of zombies. Liz is tired of Shaun's insistence on spending every opportunity that he can in the Winchester pub. Shaun promises to take her to a restaurant but, due to interference from his overpowering step-dad, forgets to book. Shaun reluctantly suggests going to the Winchester and is promptly dumped. <br/><br/>It would all be a pretty straightforward, uncomplicated story if it were not for the continuous news coverage played out in the background (Shaun and his friends remain oblivious to this, however) detailing the recent dead-returning-to-life-and-eating-people phenomenon. Soon the zombies are attacking and increasing in numbers, and Shaun has to shake his ineptitude to lead his friends to safety, rescue his mum and get Liz back. <br/><br/>The film opens with the (original) Dawn of the Dead soundtrack playing over the Universal logo, which gradually merges into The Specials 'Ghost Town. This sets the tone for the film, as this is as much homage to Romero's Living Dead trilogy as it is to British culture and comedy. It's not an easy mix, but somehow Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright strike an easy balance between them in a brilliant screenplay. The first act is played mainly for laughs and as a set up for the characters, who are particularly well-rounded for a genre film, and to also slowly build the zombie epidemic up around them. The use of radio and television to portray the arrival and eventual epidemic of the zombies is a nice touch and harks back to Romero's Dawn only here the news reports go unnoticed in the background, as people go about their business with little regard for the events surrounding them. So, we're surrounded by zombies anyway; on the bus, in the street, at work  shuffling around oblivious to each other and our problems. This is a point made bluntly, but to good effect in Shaun, again harking back to Romero's film, where the dead represent a nation of zombie-like consumers. <br/><br/>The mannerisms of the dead are similar too; Shaun opts for the slow, shuffling zombies as opposed to the new, fast ones that seem to have replaced them in modern cinema. In fact, this is a film that uses Romero as a law. A zombie law. This is Romero's universe, only the events are happening in London instead of Pittsburgh. The comedy works on two levels within Shaun, obviously one level is for humour, but the other level is an increased realism. How many zombie films are there when, having dispatched their first zombie by bludgeoning them with a cricket bat, our hero has to sit down and have a cup of tea? Through the second act and into the third, the tone of Shaun of the Dead changes. The comedy purposely thins out a little as the zombies lay siege on our heroes. In fact the final act of Shaun is downright terrifying, touching, and gory as hell, including a death scene that ranks up there alongside the best. Not to give too much away, but all that's missing is the line 'Choke on 'em!' Shaun of the Dead should appeal to a wide audience. The self titled 'romzomcom' has just that; a romantic story involving Shaun and his ex, whom he strives to win back. Lots and lots of zombies, and enough laugh out loud visual and verbal comedy moments than you can shake a disembodied leg at. So shuffle on down to your local and see this truly unique British film."
"Robert_90","10","1","2","13 April 2005"," Best use of cliché ever!
","2004. Me and a friend. This movie had intrigued me, since it promised to be scary and funny. The only actor I had heard of was Bill Nighy. Nonetheless, we turned up and saw one hell of a great movie.<br/><br/>To start on a somewhat negative note, the film is very clichéd. The film's plot seems uninspired. It interweaves the average romcom plot (loser tries to sort out his life with the help of his funny friend) with the typical horror plot (a small group of people try to survive the undead onslaught). But it's done in such a way that it manages to be entertaining. The generic rom-com characters are pulled off in such a way by the players that it doesn't feel like you've seen it a thousand times before, though you have<br/><br/>Simon Pegg shines as the eponymous hero, although the best performance comes from newcomer Nick Frost, in his role as Ed, the ultimate ""useless sidekick to hero"" romcom stereotype. He farts, admits that he loves Shaun's mum, deals drugs, plays TimeSplitters and does bugger-all. As a result he gets the best lines.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the whole movie, in a certain light, seems boring, it has some great zombie action - the most memorable being ""the backyard"" scene. It also has the best references to horror movies, making light of everybody from Dario Argento to Lucio Fulci, from George Romero to Sam Raimi. This has all the makings of a cult classic and I suggest you seek it out if you want something funny."

","What do you get when you have an electronic salesman his moronic best mate and a city widely growing in Zombie population? Shaun of the dead of course. Released (at least in the UK) around the same time as the remake of Dawn of the dead this was a great comic relief to anyone who thought the latter would be too scary but still wanted there walking dead fix. Step in Simon Pegg, great British actor and star of many comic shows including Spaced, and Nick Frost, who was also in spaced, and there portrayal of lazy drunken men who entire life is turned around by the realization of the dead coming back to life.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is Shaun, senior sales assistant at a local electronics store. He hates his stepfather and his girlfriend is becoming very bored with him.

Nighttime belongs to the Winchester pub, Shaun's local where he spends time with Liz (his girlfriend) and her friends David and Dianne.<br/><br/>When Liz decides that enough is enough Shaun's world is turned upside down, but another night in the Winchester with Ed and a very drunken rave in their living room and he is helped to forget her, maybe not for a long time but long enough to be absolutely hammered! It's only then that the true hilarity begins whether searching through records to decide which to throw at the oncoming undead or arguing whether dogs can look up this movie if full of humor and gore (what more do you need?) Even better is the end of the movie which I will leave for you to see all in all Shaun of the Dead is the reason that every one should give British films another look."

","Even if you are a horror movie fan, you have to admit that many movies in this genre are rather lame, and I happen to be one of those people). Those that are successful (meaning they have gained cult status) usually are so because of their emphasis on humour (Lord of the Rings' director Peter Jackson's splatter-fest Dead Alive comes to mind) than gore or jump-out-of-your-seat terror. Shaun of the Dead, an offering from the UKs Edgar Wright is one such flick. Your local B-movie aficionado would likely mention it in the same sentence as their Troma favorites, even with its mainstream appeal.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is essentially a love story with zombies lurking about in the background. Its unlikely hero, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a late 20s slacker who works in an electronics department. He lives a loser's life, and is looked down upon by his co-workers, is estranged from his mother and stepfather who are disappointed in his under-achievement, and his favorite hobby is sitting around playing video games and smoking pot with his flatmate, Ed. The only thing he looks forward to in life is hanging out with his friends at the Winchester, a local pub which is rumored to contain a cache of firearms.<br/><br/>Things start to roll when Shaun's girlfriend Liz decides she's had enough of his dithering and lassitude and leave him. Shaun wants to win her back, but isn't sure how. People start acting strangely, staggering around with vacant looks and biting at passers by, though Shaun is oblivious to all this unusual behaviour. To him, it's little different from seeing striving capitalists heading off to their desk jobs. After he finally realizes what is going on, (though no explanation is ever given for the zombie phenomenon), he takes action and decides to somehow save his girlfriend from the living dead and rescue his mother from the stepfather he despises, who has also started to show signs of zombie-fication.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the movie has plenty of humour and wit (though one might have to be British to understand a lot of it), with little gore and few scary moments. One particularly funny scene has Shaun's group making its way to the Winchester Pub through a throng of living dead by mimicking their mannerisms, thereby not drawing any attention to themselves. Another involves Shaun and Ed using Shaun's records like ninja throwing stars to stop the dead in their tracks. As befits what is essentially a romantic comedy, the movie has a happy ending, with a surprising epilogue as well. Several Queen classics in the soundtrack make for an additional treat. This movie might even be good for a first date. Make sure you don't die of laughter. 8/10"

","Spaced fans love it, especially the scene in the Winchester at the start where Ed and Shaun go over what happens the next day as a pub run. 'We have a bite at the king's head', Phil's demise into a zombie, 'Come back to the Winchester for some shots', the rifle shootings at the pub, 'a bloody Mary', the girl in the garden. The other thing is that it is NOT a spoof, unlike the opinions of others. Simon and Edgar respect the movies to much. If you are new to the Spaced fan club and have only seen Shaun, and enjoyed it of course, than I suggest you go out and get the Spaced DVD's or collection, as you will be surprised at the classic lines fitted into each episode and the movie parodies, which are the basis for the show, especially episode 5, series 1, the zombie episode in which began the idea for Shaun."

","Ever watch a Romero flick and wonder, ""Why is it there's always some heroic and noble character in there? What would happen if you stuck real life people in this situation?"" Shaun of the Dead answers that question. Actually, it answers that question with such precision that it's quite disturbing. With my luck, I wouldn't be stuck with expert marksman and all-around badass Roger from Dawn of the Dead. Hell no. With my luck, I'd be sitting in the dark eating peanuts with Shaun.<br/><br/>I love the approach the creators took to the film. Instead of a relentless and mindless bashing of the zombie genre, Shaun of the Dead is actually quite affectionate towards its inspiration. As far as the zombies go, Shaun of the Dead is every bit as legitimate as George Romero's movies; what makes it a comedy is the characters and how they deal with the situation. In Dawn and Day of the Dead, you have military personnel trying to survive in a place they can fortify. In Shaun of the Dead you have a guy sitting in the dark eating peanuts as he waits for the whole thing to go away.<br/><br/>This approach, I feel, is infinitely superior to the whole ""Let's make mindless jokes that appeal to the lowest common denominator"" method. The humor isn't always insultingly spelled out and shoved down the audience's throat--freeze-frame and flash ""laugh now"" on the screen why don't they (see Scary Movie 3)? I like how the humor in Shaun stems from simple observations about zombies, how they resemble drunks, and when you have a hangover you really don't notice them. And I really like how some jokes will only register with horror fans (A restaurant named after Fulci? Heh, I'll pass, thanks.) The cast of misfits is fun to follow, and possesses a degree of depth that's vital for good comedies to work (granted purely silly characters can work when they're the exception and not the rule.) Bear in mind, I'm not talking Scorsese-deep characters but these aren't purely goof-ball caricatures a la Monty Python (when done well) and Scary Movie 3 (when done poorly). They have their moments of glory, moments of trauma, and moments of despair (I mean, end of the world zombie infestation can become quite depressing when you think about it.) But through it all, the film is still funny, still a comedy . . . a black comedy, but a comedy none-the-less.<br/><br/>On a separate note Â– I think it's funny (for the wrong reasons) that Shaun of the Dead is one of the first zombie films to show a death scene reminiscent of the master Tom Savini's Dead effects since . . . well, Tom Savini's work on Dawn/Day of the Dead. ""Choke on 'em!"" Anyway, Shaun of the Dead is a film for zombie-genre freaks made by zombie-genre freaks. Everyone'll get something out of it, but the genre fans will watch Shaun with the satisfaction that this project fell into the hands of people who actually ""know"" the genre instead of someone who simply ""knows of"" the genre."

","Shawn of the Dead is not the best zombie movie ever made, nor is it the best romantic comedy. However, it fills both roles so amazingly well that lovers of both genres should be satisfied. That is, unless your movies have to scare the pants off of you. People who love to be scared aren't going to get kicks from this movie. It's more of a fast-paced suspense film with some good fake blood and gore and a feel-good drama going on in the background. Aside from the genre, the film also employs some good story advancement techniques such as the television ads and joke shows that are reminiscent of Verhoeven's work. (total recall/starship troopers) This movie does not attempt to be epic or create some otherworldly or post-apocalyptic dream-scape, but it creates an intimate mood between the small group of survivors who exist in an innocuous suburban enclave, except with zombies. Furthermore, it manages to pull all of it's elements together without leaving anything behind or unfinished. I found it incredibly fun to watch, and that is as good of a measure I can think of for a film. Perhaps it's not the only measure, but we all to have a laugh now and again."
"wynni1","Null","1","2","7 March 2005"," Best zombie build-up ever
","Yes, we all know about how terrific, original, creative, funny, etc. this movie is, but there is one aspect of ""Shaun of the Dead"" that tends to be overlooked. One thing that - to my knowledge - no zombie movie has ever pulled off as well as Shaun, maybe because of the expectations an audience has of a zombie comedy as opposed to a flat-out zombie movie, and that is the zombie build-up. Think about it: Night of the Living Dead had a zombie show up to motivate the plot within the first five minutes; Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead both started ""in medias zombie,"" and even if the zombies weren't actually on screen for the first fifteen or twenty minutes, they were the driving force behind the plot. I liked 28 Days Later (which was, in form and execution, a zombie movie with slightly modified monsters), but I was a little disappointed that they skipped over the 28 days of chaos after the Rage virus emerged. Let's face it, nobody deals with the day-to-day mechanics of a zombie invasion. Until now.<br/><br/>By using the romantic-comedy element of the movie, the filmmakers were able to move the movie from the start without using zombies; you have twenty minutes of relationship comedy with weird elements in the background, and you get to watch as the world slowly collapses into zombified chaos. Now that's brilliant. The characters aren't ""zombie movie"" characters, they're romantic comedy characters who suddenly have to fight the undead; again, that's brilliant. Let's face it, we don't live our lives like a zombie movie. If there are lots of police sirens going off, or people running down the street in a panic we figure there's lots of crime and people are morons. That's what makes zombie movies so effective; it's not like these are aliens conquering the earth. Zombies are just like us. ""Shaun of the Dead"" plays zombies for laughs, but at the end - as in any good zombie movie - whatever we're laughing at is really, truly terrifying."
"Caps Fan","7","1","2","3 March 2005"," Gory, but has a certain charm!
","Minor British pictures quite often turn out to be little gems and here's another contribution to that fine tradition.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg turns in an assured performance as the hapless Shaun, a loser in a dead-end job who knows how to hang on to useless friends, like Ed (nauseatingly well played by Nick Frost), but can't keep his attractive girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because he can't manage a simple thing like reserving a restaurant table. Then he really finds himself as London is subjected to a plague of zombies.<br/><br/>Difficult to fault any of the performances in this film and the soundtrack is well judged, but the main pleasures are in the visual gags and some superb one liners. My favorite among the former were the early scenes showing the deadening nature of Shaun's everyday life and a later scene where Shaun's party, seeking to find refuge at a local pub, encounter a party led by his ex-girlfriend. The groups are mirror images and greet each other as if they were at a vicarage tea party!<br/><br/>The ending works well, though some may find it tasteless. It is at least consistent with the rest.<br/><br/>Recommended, unless you're put off by gore or strong language. Rating: 7/10."

"moviereal","6","1","2","8 February 2005"," Shaun of the Dead in Review
","Of all the many horror film subjects, zombies are arguably the most popular. These resurrected, flesh-eating, stiff-limbed, groaning fiends who stalk the earth in search of living bodies to devour are constantly captivating viewing audiences, and haunting the dreams of the more impressionable. Zombie films range from the deadly serious and scary, such as Dawn of the Dead, to classics such as Night of the Living Dead, to series films like Zombie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Some series regarding the walking dead begin seriously, but quickly degenerate into ridiculous parody. Such was the case with the Evil Dead trilogy, a cult classic loved for its outlandish last installation. These parodies are the inspiration for other parodies, the latest of these hailing from the UK. Shaun of the Dead, directed by Edgar Wright, and obviously playing off the similarly-titled Dawn of the Dead, is a completely hilarious zombie parody, replete with dry British humor and flesh-eating fests."

"Son_of_Mansfield","9","1","2","29 January 2005"," I'm having a ball.
","For some reason the zombie movie is back in a big way and I am loving it. This movie is just plain fun. Simon Pegg as Shaun, Nick Frost as Ed, Kate Ashfield as Liz, Dylan Moran as David, Bill Nighy as Phillip, and Penelope Wilton as Barbara make up a great cast. Everyone has some good lines and there are references aplenty to other zombie movies. My favorite reference is the shot of Shaun and Ed through the hole of Mary which is extremely similar to a shot in Death Becomes Her of Madeleine and Ernest through the hole of Helen. My three favorite scenes are Shaun's walk to the store on Z-day, the saving mum and Liz montages, and the final showdown in the bar. You have to see Shaun, Ed, and Liz beating a zombie to Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" to fully appreciate it. Unlike the ""beat the audience on the head with the joke"" comedies that we see too many of, this movie uses Shaun for the subtle and Ed for the very unsubtle. ""Can I get any of you c**ts a drink,"" is an fine example of Ed's vocabulary. This is married to watching Shaun blindly pass several zombies on the way to the store and even talking to one as he passes oblivious. The first scene is staged well also, reveling people only as they are mentioned I could go on seemingly forever with what I like about this movie. People who don't like movie should not be trusted or associated with for fear of infection. The DVD has some fun features including: plot holes explained, a complete early storyboard of the film, good deleted scenes, and outtakes such as Sean Connery and Michael Caine in The Man Who Would Be Shaun.<br/><br/>*Shaun: ""David kill the Queen.""

"noizyme","8","1","2","29 January 2005"," Great (British) take on the zombie genre.
","The rise of the zombies is upon us! At least, it's occurring in this great zombie parody movie about one man, Shaun, who is trying to protect his 2 friends, his girlfriend's 2 friends, and his mother from becoming another part of the zombie race.<br/><br/>This movie came out right after Dawn of the Dead left the theaters (the remake), and I give them props for the remake in the style that they made. It's set in England so you get the cultural change (the flagrant use of a cricket bat, the different style of cars, a kid playing with a soccer ball, the frequent going to the pub, etc) from the real Dawn of the Dead, which I thought was a great addition. There was a slight humor to the situations that were involved, which was the main point of this movie because any obvious, ""Airplane""-like gags would've probably been seen as over-the-top. Also they love music in this movie; Queen's songs are being played almost every 5th scene it seems, and there's pretty good underground culture being recognized (sining ""White Lines"" with an accompanying zombie, an aphex twin poster in the hall, etc.) This movie's very entertaining, especially for parties and the like because of the frequent action and humor. There are some touching points being made between Shaun and his parents, for example, but after wards, that turns around a full 360 degrees when he's got the responsibilities to kill them off because they've been made into zombies. (that's a little too much given away, but there's more to the movie.) Anyways, I gave it an 8/10. It had a few parts that got away from the action and everything (the romantic element), but otherwise, it's fantastic. Run out and buy it today."

","I was reluctant to watch Shaun of the Dead because I'm not a horror film fan. Is it just me or are films that want to screw me up emotionally for life just a bad idea? :) But the previews looked good and Shaun of the Dead delivered. It was a little scary but no more so than the average action film. And truly hilarious. And this is from a guy who didn't even get the ""in jokes"". The film balanced the ludicrous situations (necessarily for humor) with some real characters (necessary for us to care about them and get drawn into the drama). And quite intelligent, too. This wasn't The Mummy not by a long shot.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film I can tell you that critically, there was no deus ex machina (convenient trick ending that makes no sense). The ""rules"" for zombie behavior did not vary conveniently to the plot. And the parallel between zombies and real-life people living monotonous lives was a wonderful analogy. I loved this film. The only flaw I can think of is that it is fairly low as far as special effects and stunts go. The ending is cute but could have been higher impact.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Comedy lovers, and it's safe for most kids<br/><br/>-- Definitely all horror film lovers I'll give Shaun of the Dead an outstanding 8 out of 10."
"unakaczynski","9","1","2","2 October 2004"," Zombie gore and British Humor, Humour...
","Firstly, there was hardly any way I wouldn't have liked this film. I love zombie movies. I love gore. The only problem with this movie I had was that it could have used more gore and cannibalism. But then again, I'm a zombie, shall we say, connoisseur, and I expect a lot of gore. This movie follows ecstatically the road well paved by George Romero and Peter Jackson's ""Dead"" (Night of the Living, Dawn of, Day of) and Dead-Alive respectively. Plus, with commercial approval from George Romero, Peter Jackson, AND Sam Raimi, hell, how could you go wrong?? I would've wasted money on Alien Vs. Predator if those three had approved of it publicly (although I would have to question their sanity). <br/><br/>While there wasn't enough gore for me, there seemed to be plenty for the average movie-goer judging from the reaction of the audience around me. But again, I enjoy Zombie (Zombi 2 in Italia), Dawn of the Dead (both versions), Day of the Dead, and Dead-Alive--and good luck topping the gore of those films and getting away with an R rating. <br/><br/>But to all you Zombie fans, you will, as can be expected, enjoy noticing several obvious (and not-so-obvious) references to past Zombie works--mostly Romero's masterpieces. Right down to individual character lines to tiny portions of music. <br/><br/>It's also a great movie for a first date with a teeny-boppery ditz girl. No really. It is. She'll be all over you afterwards.<br/><br/>(sucker!!)<br/><br/>www.ResidentHazard.com"

","This movie was 'bloody' well done...no pun intended. I went into this film not knowing really what to expect but maybe a dark comedy which is why I came out very happy. While I was right about it being funny, it's also an excellent zombie film going on in the meantime. Believe it or not there weren't as many comical moments as I thought there was going to be but some instances were just downright hilarious. The acting was superb and I could tell it must've been an extreme challenge for them since they'd have to go from comedic to dramatic to tragic in what was sometimes probably only a matter of seconds. I definitely gave a big thumbs up to the cast after I noticed this. Even with the apparent low-budget I think the zombie's were effective and looked just as real as in most other movies. Overall a great movie and I highly recommend it to take your mind of life's boring subtleties.<br/><br/>Final Review:<br/><br/>Movies: Worth every cent of the ticket price.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: Yes, there is a very good chance this might be the start of a series.<br/><br/>Rental: If by no other means then absolutely!"
"spiffythedog","10","1","2","24 September 2004"," It's so damn good.
","Just see the movie. I'm telling you right now, don't read any review, spoilers or not, until you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>Now, I might be a little biased because i am absolutely in love with this movie. It hit me in all the right places, it's hilarious, it's tragic, it's silly, it's dramatic. I've never loved a set of characters from a horror film more - and that's the problem I've always had with zombie movies in particular. Now, sure, I like zombie movies, but it's always been about the zombies, and that's why the movies are good. In Shaun of the Dead, it's about the living characters. The first half hour of the film goes by without any zombies at all, just hints in the background to the coming epidemic - it actually lets you get to know the characters before the horror, which is a heroically refreshing change in things recently. And when the zombies come, hoo, boy. My favorite parts in the film come from the period in which the zombies just begin to appear, and it's so great that they don't just show up. It's so gradual that Shaun and everybody else don't even notice it, even though it's right there in the background. And, oh, the background humor. God, this movie has BACKGROUND HUMOR. I have so desperately missed subtle background humor in movies today. Right around when Shaun leaves his day at work, you should begin watching the background of every scene - and the fact that the background humor works so well is proof that Edgar Wright is a true director, completely in control of every little detail in each individual frame of the film. This movie is directed with such confidence that it's almost ridiculous to believe that his only prior directing work is in TV shows - especially because he uses the widescreen format so well (this is one of those movies that would just be a shame to watch in fullscreen.) Actually, there is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't really been said already, and this review has been so disorganized because there's just so much to say. I could go into it more and more but it would be a waste of time for both you and me - just go see it.<br/><br/>Go see it, go see it, go see it."
"dj_bassett","Null","1","2","26 September 2004"," Just a great flick
","This is one of those ideas that is so obvious you end up hitting your head, wondering why you didn't think of it yourself: combine 28 DAYS with the British genre that's most famous nowadays, ""overgrown adolescents learn to accept responsibility and get lives"". In England, Shaun and his going-nowhere best friend are living lives of quiet desperation, until his girlfriend dumping him and, incidentally, a zombie uprising, causes Shaun to get a clue. <br/><br/>I really liked this. This is almost a perfect blend of humor and seriousness: some people have knocked the film for this but I think it's just right, so much so that I actually got a little misty-eyed toward the end of the movie, and I can't say I've done that with any other release this year. Particularly funny is Shaun's early cluelessness during the outbreak.<br/><br/>The movie does post-modernism proud, as it's both a play on genre conventions and a celebration of them: this is an extremely tough thing to pull off, but they manage to do it with style. Because it's mainly a riff on established conventions, not something unique, the movie does suffer from a certain diffuseness: early on it looks like the theme will be ""modern society creates zombies by itself"" ala DAWN OF THE DEAD, but that soon gets abandoned, for instance, as there's too much other stuff to refer to. Still, the characters believe in what they're doing absolutely, which helps a lot in these sorts of things. Jokes aren't funny if the deliver is sniggering as he delivers them. <br/><br/>This is the sort of thing KILL BILL was trying to do: I liked those movies but they never really congealed into more than the sum of their parts, the way this did. SHAUN OF THE DEAD is essentially a goof, an inside joke (in some ways the definition of post modernism) but it's a very good example of it. Highly recommended."
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","8","1","2","26 September 2004"," The Most Insane Creation Ever!
","""Shaun Of The Dead"" is far beyond what one might expect, a typical British comedy laden with outlandish, quirky dialogue and scenario; it's outlandish, outrageous, and absolutely insane working unconventionally as both a satisfying comedy and a gruesome blood fest. It will probably go down as an instant cult classic, offering pokes-a-plenty at a drug-induced, conscience-weary society (enter Shaun, who seems oblivious and impervious to the gory catastrophe which has yet to even affect his daily routine until (one of them) threatens to take over his body), along with today's obsession with ""kill and destroy"" everything which budges in one's path (kill the zombies before they can harm us). The dialogue itself is laden with standard, vivacious British humor and substance (""I love my mum!""; ""There's no ""I"" in team, but there's ""I"" in pie""), and as an American ashamed to admit I have hardly explored this British culture, I found the dialogue original, convivial and refreshing; only in a British comedy can decapitating zombies seem so fun and hilarious! Aside from constantly shelling out some appreciated humor, the film is indeed a disgusting gore-fest, so be warned, those who dispose at the mention of ""blood and guts"": this is probably not your movie. Of course, the premise is rhetorically reminiscent of ""Dawn of the Dead"", strictly a horror film, and this film makes light and dread on the ""town takeover of the zombies"" premise in such a clever, if excessive and obscene, execution. Towards the end, the comedy premise sort of wanes away and the story deviates in various other tones: drama (mother-son bonds), romance (Shaun and Liz inseparable), and horror (the violence at times becomes overwhelming and we lament the characters' apparent doom). Perhaps this constructive deviation is less appreciated than if the film would have retained its initial premise of silly, obscene, grotesque comedy. The ending is routine, if over-the-top, but then again, how else would one expect a zany film as this to conclude? Its silly, fresh (if obscene) hilarious premise collaborating with the ""zombie invasion"" premise, makes ""Shaun of the Dead"" one insane, droll, and zany British comedy, sure to be an international ""guilty pleasure"" hit! *** out of ****"
"pixelmixer","Null","1","2","25 September 2004"," Should have been compressed.
","The cast attracted me to this DVD. Simon Pegg and Lucy Davis in particular were the names that shone from the DVD case. When I read the other cast names, I knew this was going to be something special.<br/><br/>And it didn't disappoint. The cast is fabulous. The direction is great and is a clever blend of UK blandness and comedy genius. Residents of the UK will recognise so many of the cast members but those outside of the country will still appreciate their abilities.<br/><br/>Zombie movies in the past have been numerous and predictable and Shaun Of The Dead is still very predictable. This is a good thing - I found myself looking thirty seconds into the future and I was usually correct. Not a bad thing though - it almost immersed me into the film.<br/><br/>My biggest criticism is that this whole movie could have been (and maybe should have been) shortened into something like an hour special. There are a few scenes (additional to those included on the DVD extras) that I felt could have been excluded. When you see the deleted scenes you realize the reasons why they were deleted, but also pick out other scenes that probably should have been left out too.<br/><br/>The story was always going to be pretty basic. The characters are great and they all have their particular relevance in the film. The seamless inclusion of Sky News footage of the outside world is great and is a brilliant touch and adds more UK-ness to the whole thing. Without it, the movie would have been missing something. American disaster movies always try to insert CNN footage to intensify the effect and Sky is the obvious UK alternative.<br/><br/>The reasons behind the zombie infestation is never revealed and I like that. It would have made the plot far more complex. It didn't really matter while I was watching the movie why these zombies had appeared and the characters didn't really dwell on it either - it was always about survival.<br/><br/>It's a great Saturday night post-pub movie that requires you to turn off your brain and switch it to funny mode. It's funnier if you are British because of the music references and a few of the actors, but it's still completely universal (no pun intended). Never take it seriously.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. I'm giving it a seven out of ten. It's missing more points because I found a few scenes particularly unnecessary which makes me think that it could have been shortened to an hour for a TV special rather than a feature film, but I'm glad that Simon Pegg is attempting these projects and have always enjoyed his material. Everyone involved in this movie is destined for more, so remember their names."

And, on balance, I tend to hate them more than I like them.<br/><br/>However, in SOTD's case I loved it. I can imagine that some of the humour will go over the heads of non-Brits, as the comedy in SOTD is very British. However, that doesn't stop it from being a fun movie throughout.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see the affectionate homages to classic zombie films of the past, such as Day of the Dead et al. There were probably more little nods at the genre than I noticed but the two ones that stood out to me were the entrail-ripping scene and, right at the end as the credits roll, the music playing is the music from Dawn of the Dead (original) as the zombies enter the mall and go shopping.<br/><br/>As I note in the header, this one is almost assured of becoming a cult movie.

","Described as a 'British' comedy-horror, this is a very 'English' film, complete with English-style pubs, English silly humour, a generous splattering of gore, and the sort of fish-and-chips romance that goes with English sitcoms. Shaun is caught amidst a growing epidemic of zombies - presumably sparked of by genetically modified crops. Attempts to save his girlfriend and mum (and various others) result in an ill-conceived plan to hole up in the local pub. Humorous references to people with 'dead-end jobs' abound, and also to the attempts by Shaun's girlfriend to get him to 'live a little' rather than hanging out down the pub with his dead-loss mates. The joke is carried even further when the group have to impersonate zombies so as not to be noticed, even to the point of practice auditions.

In short it worked out better, if you like any of Spaced, Black Books or Phoenix Nights you'll like this.<br/><br/>For the rest of you, this is a romantic comedy that just happens to occur while zombies are taking over the planet.  Shaun (writer Simon Pegg) is a complete loser who still works in an electronics store aged 29.  He lives with his best mate from college who hates his best mate from Primary school who came round to visit 5 years ago and didn't leave.  He's so obsessed with shuffling through his normal boring life he fails to notice the entire world being overrun by zombies.<br/><br/>As the title implies these zombies are very much from the Resident evil / George Romero school.  They're essentially useless and just shuffle round stupidly until you encounter them in packs at which point they become a problem.<br/><br/>The zombies are not really the major point of the movie.  Unlike the americans who in Bruce Almighty try to have us believe a TV presenter living with Jennifer Aniston is a loser, Shaun really is.

It really was as good as I was expecting, and after watching Spaced, that was A LOT. So no suprises there. What DID suprise me, however, was that, unlike Spaced, the film contained a lot of drama and ""lump in your throat"" moments. Obviously, they were quickly followed by another great one-liner, but it made a change to see that the script writers could incorporate more than just comedy into the film (And that the actors could pull it off convincingly) without cheapening the show, or making it seem like they'd included it for diversity, but not thought that much about it.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

After all, we had no real reason to care about her, so no matter how good Pegg's acting, I just didn't buy the situation. But when he's saying goodbye to his best friend, it really struck me how talented this guy is. It's no oscar winning performance, but then it's not trying to be. Simon Pegg really impressed me, not only with his acting but with how caring the script was to certain situations. At some points, it felt like there'd been no jokes for minutes (which is normally unusual for this film) and it was at times like these that you could appreciate the characters, and see them as more than just 2-dimensional ""slaughter monkeys"".<br/><br/>*spoiler*spoiler*spoiler*spoiler*spoiler*spoiler*spoiler*<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Overall, I think this film is MORE than you'd expect it to be. There's an excessive use of profanity/blood/violence but it's all acceptable, as it's all only a tool for the excellent script and acting. (And if you love ""Britcoms"" like I do, the cameo's will please too!)<br/><br/>Brittish comedy films (or RomZom's!) don't get any better than this. If you liked Spaced, you HAVE to see this. If you have a sense of humour, you probably should see this. If you have nothing better to do on a friday night, you should DEFFINITELY watch this. (did I not mention that it is also a mindless zombie-bash-athon?)"

","When the new Dawn of the Dead film came out I wasn't very interested in seeing it but my friend told me about this film and I was there as soon as it came out. The basic story is about a hapless man named Shaun who works at an electrical store amongst younger, more up and coming employees. His girlfriend has had enough of him and dumps him after he messes up a restaurant booking. In his grief he doesn't notice the strange people shuffling up and down the road moaning and doesn't pay much attention to the numerous news reports. That is until a girl is standing in his back garden and he and his bone idle friend go outside to investigate. I won't say anymore except it is a brilliant comedy/horror. There was a lot of gore and everyone including me was laughing their arse off. I for one will be seeing it again and again. Simon Pegg is a genius (as demonstrated by Spaced and Big Train) and I for one want his babies."
"chopperchubb","10","1","2","9 April 2004"," funny and scary. best uk comedy horror in ages.
","I had been eagerly awaiting this film since I first heard it was on the cards some time ago. Having missed the first series of ""SPACED"", I was introduced to it at a later date and loved the referential nature of the programme(both to itself and previous moments in pop culture and film), and thought it one of the most original comedies of recent times, mainly because of the accessibility of its characters.<br/><br/>Usually I go to see comedy or horror with several mates. But I couldn't wait for them to be around for this one. The cinema was about half full & I was laughing out loud with at least two thirds of the audience. I look forward to seeing it again with mates and seeing their reactions. I can guarantee they will find it at least as funny as I did.<br/><br/>OK so I came to this as a fairly avid fan of ""SPACED"" and ""Big Train"" previously. But this actually increased my  expectations of the project. I would be interested to hear the opinions of people who never caught these however. Hopefully they will be encouraged to get hold of the DVDs of these.<br/><br/>The menace builds quite gradually like the best of the genre, with nods to cinematic history in the soundtrack from the start. Normality prevails at first(a convention, but one that works well)it seems. The ""zombies"" are beautifully inept(more like original Dawn of the Dead than,say, 28 Days Later or ED3) and provide many a comedic moment of indecision/violence.<br/><br/>Ed (Mark Frost's character) was a little less comic but more human than Mike in SPACED. An überslob rather than a territorial. All the same, the relationship between him and Simon Pegg's Shaun aped Tim and Mike.<br/><br/>
Peter Serafinowicz was inspired casting as the twunt of a 3rd flatmate & provides a couple of genuinely scary moments. Bill Nighy is slightly throwaway ( he always reminded me of David Davies of the FA and Midlands Today with that haircut) but as always reliable as Shaun's (step)dad. Also, if you either liked or completely hated Dylan Moran in Black Books or How Do You Want Me you might like this film. Won't spoil the reason why.<br/><br/>There's a brilliant cameo bit that I won't spoil in the middle,but I suppose the main difference between this and SPACED is that Jessica Stevenson only plays a minor (albeit crucial) role in this film. I was a bit disappointed not to see Mark Heap or Bill Bailey in it - they would have made great featured zombies(shouldn't be using that word!).Then again, might have been over egging the pudding.<br/><br/>To be honest, I don't think I have done the film justice thus far. In summing up, this is up there with Evil Dead 2 and Demons as one of the funniest (intentionally funny) horror movies I have ever seen. It may also be that I missed some of the references, so I look forward to seeing it again after a bit more discussion with afficionado mates.<br/><br/>Go see this film if you like comedy or horror. or preferably both. You will not be disappointed."

I'm very relieved that the film is excellent, with good pacing and characterisation and even horror. One of the character's deaths could be interpreted as a homage to a certain gruesome ending in the original Dawn of the Dead. It also has a smidgin of the social commentary of the aforementioned film which its recent remake overlooked. The feeling coming out of this film was of laughing all the way through it, yet not remembering a lot of the jokes. This will live up to repeated viewing and WILL become a classic."

These should be ignored. Totally. This film does them no injustice whatsoever, but takes the well proven zombie formula and injects some home grown humour, while still retaining the tension and jump-out-of-your-seat scary moments.<br/><br/>It should be seen as a compliment to Romero's films.

","This is one of these films that got hyped to high heavens when it was released in Britain and thought it might have been simply down to being a British film that did well at the box office . Strangely becoming a cult hit on the international scene didn't tarnish its reputation and it spent several years in the IMDb Top 250 and now all most ten years after its release it still has an average user rating of 8 . Very strange <br/><br/>I say very strange because it's not really a film I have ever got in to . I think it's because the plot is a one trick pony - man wakes up to find zombies roaming around and doesn't realise it until it's almost too late . It's very often a bad idea when segments of a film has the audience one step ahead of the characters . Perhaps not so much a bad idea but the makers have to do something to grab the audiences attention and here in my opinion they've failed . There's also the added problem that Danny Boyle's quasi Zombies that can run faster than an Olympic sprinter had come out at the same time so the undead here who stagger around aren't much of a menace to the characters <br/><br/>If the film has anything going for it then it's the editing which is quite impressive as one scene segues in to another but apart from that I wasn't too impressed by any other of the aspects of the film . A lot of people here have mentioned Channel 4 sit-coms such as SPACED and BLACK BOOKS which other shows I've found it difficult to get in to so I guess the producers know what their market is"

With few lol's to offer but the same sort of obvious tailoring for the irreverent and unsophisticated young adult crowd as a Kevin Smith (Dogma, Mallrats, etc.) flick, ""Shaun of the Dead"" manages to clunk along with good production value, a meager story, and some cult appeal.

As a result, lots of mediocre or above average films are given astronomical scores (a great case in point, the film MEMENTO). Now this ISN'T to say that SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a bad film--it's very good, but it isn't so good that I would rank it in the IMDb Top 250! In fact, it's a darn clever film that manages to inject life into a dull genre (zombie movies--when you've seen one, you think you've seen them all).

","I could have easily highlighted the performance of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in this review for how good they were - and to some extent I will - but I want to focus on Edgar Wright's direction, because I think that it, beyond the wonderful script and performances, is what makes this movie as funny and entertaining as it is.<br/><br/>I reviewed Scott Pilgrim vs. The World a little while back and in that review, I noted Wright's use of quick cuts to add comedic effect and speed up of the pace of the film. He continues to use that in Shaun of the Dead and to even better effect. The quick cuts and close ups of Pegg and Frost are often hilarious because of the way they move from action to reaction quickly. It doesn't give the audience to process any other reaction than the one we see on Simon Pegg's face at that given moment. Speaking of Pegg, his and Frost's performances add another layer to the already funny film. Wright puts Pegg and Frost in positions to show off what makes them hilarious. Their friendship is front and center in the film - even to the point of interfering with Pegg's character's other relationship. One scene in particular that I really enjoyed between the two friends is when the apocalypse first breaks out and they are trying to kill the zombies and realize that you have to aim at the head. Wright immediately cuts quickly to them in the backyard going through a vinyl collection, bantering back and forth, and trying to hit the zombies in the head with the vinyls. It's the combination of the absurdity of these two men trying to navigate something as serious as the zombie apocalypse in combination with Edgar Wright's direction that makes this movie absolutely worth your time."
"robertcook-70807","10","1","3","25 March 2017"," Classic!
","Shaun of the Dead is notable for the kinetic directional style used by director Edgar Wright. It is a comedy/horror film that is a suspenseful zombie movie and a British comedy. The film puts the viewers on the edge of their seats and will have you laughing out loud at the most suspenseful moments in the film. The audience is kept interested by the brilliant dialogue, laughs, and gore. We are introduced Shaun who seems to live a very flat and boring life and seems to be quite content with his short comings in life. Shaun has some serious growing up to do and his lack of direction and disconnect with the world around him makes him completely blind to the zombie outbreak that breaks out in London. It is said that in a crisis is when you see the character of a man and for Shaun the day of reckoning is now. There are three central themes in this film are comedy, horror, and romance. The film takes seemingly ordinary actions and make them oddly intense by using uncomfortable close-ups, loud sound effects and unexpected transitions. The sudden transitions help to build suspense long before any of the real action occurs. This is a very successful technique that can add suspense and tension around extremely humorous dialogue and character interaction. The zombies are very slow in this film versus new films but it gives us a lot more dialogue between the characters<br/><br/>The main method of portraying the comedy in the film us through irony. The irony of how many times the outbreak is right in front of Shaun and his best friend Ed is hilarious. Shaun is a very easily lovable character despite his many flaws and you route for him to succeed. A main staple of the film is the sound effects. Using intense and defined, that is typically found in action movies, for the normal everyday activities heightens the humor of the scene. Shaun's lackadaisical life comes with an action-packed soundtrack, muting outside noises, so the audience can focus their attention on the stumbling against an object or the opening of a soda can which becomes an epic action. This film has that laugh out loud factor that will make it memorable for years to come."

I particularly enjoyed the moment when they try to kill the zombies by flinging classic record albums at them like Oddjob and his deadly Bowler in 'Goldfinger.'<br/><br/>What starts out as a simple story about a zhlub who wants to get his girlfriend back and sort things out with his mum turns into a comical tale of survival for Shaun and his buddies. And what's more English than the gang ending up at the Winchester, their favorite pub, in a standoff with a ravenous zombie horde?<br/><br/>As of this writing (February 2013), this little gem did around $15.5M worldwide. Not bad for a small independent film. Be sure to look for Penelope Wilton, from 'Downton Abbey,' as Barbara.

"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","18 December 2016"," The first and best Wright/Pegg/Frost comedy
","Appearing from out of the blue, this is a reminder of the good things that British cinema has to offer. A great caste, a cracking, laugh-a-minute script and a distinctively British twist on the old-fashioned zombie proceedings make this one to watch. It works brilliantly as a comedy, with tons of laughs (the dart in the head scene is still my favourite) and plenty of witty repartee. As a zombie film, it's also cool, what with social referencing, sometimes astonishing scenes of gore (we've got people being impaled, beaten, and in one outstanding moment, Dylan Moran getting his guts torn out and his legs torn off) and loads and loads of suspense and action. I've never seen anything quite like it.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is the star and his crew from SPACED do most of the work behind the scenes. Pegg, who I'd never watched before, is great, with his typical everyday looks and impeccable timing. His brutish friend Ed, as played by the strangely familiar Nick Frost, steals every moment he's on screen, proving to be the better than Johnny Vegas. The supporting cast, of seemingly every British TV comedian in existence, is also fine , with Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy as Pegg's parents particularly good. The film is chock-full of references; even the pre-credits production titles have the music from DAWN OF THE DEAD on them! There are plenty more scenes that you'll miss but that repeat viewing will show. The reason the film is so successful is because of the originality. Okay, so the overall plot is familiar, but the individual jokes, humour, and physicality of it pay off in dividends. The ending is a little too dark in places but nevertheless the film's winning streak of black comedy makes it worthwhile. Okay, so I still don't know if dogs can look up, but watching this film is a fine and fun experience."

But Shaun of the Dead is just too dang fun and filled with cliché bending humor that Wright's style proves to be the best thing about this Horror-Comedy.<br/><br/>The first of the Cornetto or ""Three Flavor's"" trilogy focuses on a world in the midst of a zombie outbreak, and two loser friends who don't really do anything with their lives. Buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play the duo, and brilliantly so. I much preferred their bro-mance to the romance between Pegg and Kate Ashfield, who plays his girlfriend Liz. <br/><br/>The enjoyment here is clearly with the fact that if a zombie outbreak ever did happen, I would act exactly how these characters did. I don't watch the news and rarely care to people watch when running to the store, so I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't realize there was a Zombie-apocalypse going on either. Or even the gag where Pegg struggles to shoot a shotgun. These are all real-life scenarios put into a horror film, and thus the comedy works better than expected.<br/><br/>It doesn't feature an Oscar winning script or world class actors, but it is loads of fun with a kicka** soundtrack paired with amazingly timed physical gags.

"timboteo","9","1","3","27 July 2016"," Beautiful Symphony of Comedy and Horror
","Shaun of The Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004), is part of a three-part series which involve many of the same cast members throughout each film. The trio is called The Cornetto Trilogy, and it is (in my opinion) the best series of film comedy to date. Shaun of The Dead, however, is the first film I saw f the series and is still my favorite of all three (Hot Fuzz in VERY close second). This parody of the American-Made zombie film cult classics, fuses comedy and horror better than any other film in its genre. The film begins by giving the viewer a glimpse into Shaun's (Simon Pegg) systematic and unimaginably boring lifestyle. We follow Pegg's character as he (literally) trudges through his daily grind. We see throughout the day that he is in his mid-thirties and a low-level electronic store manager with step-daddy issues. If that doesn't explain his dull life, then knowing that he lives with two roommates from college (Ed, Nick Frost, who sells weed for a living and Pete, Peter Serafinowicz, who is a tight-ass) and his love life is in shambles. Once we are given the initial tour of Shaun's personal life, things start getting strange. The film does an excellent job of giving us subtle hints that foreshadow the events of the next day. The next morning, Shaun goes back to his initial routine (as shown the previous day). This time, however, the environment has changed dramatically. The same extras that we saw roaming the streets are now either dead or aware of the horrific situation. It is hilarious to see Shaun being so oblivious (and almost robotic in nature) that he has no idea that anything is wrong until he makes it back to the house. This is when the violence and starts to ensue and the way the characters interact with each other and the surrounding environment is perfectly executed, mixing comedy and horror together in one beautiful symphony. Don't get me wrong, the film is fairly gruesome. If you get queasy from the sight of blood and guts, be sure to have a barf-bag near. The language is also quite graphic and there is a pinch of lewd (back-of-the-middle school- bus humor) that isn't foreign to other Edgar Wright films. The movie will bring out every emotion in you from laughter induced crying to sadness induced crying. In all, this film is an instant classic from comedy lovers and horror lovers all the same. Wright did an excellent job directing the second addition to the three-part series. From the casting to the camera work, he spared no expense to ensure the proper execution of a romantic-comedy-horror (which is a genre that is typically filled with atrocities)."

Fabulous :)))))) The zombies are also very welcome and the comic timing is on point, These two (Simon Pegg and Nick Forst) Just work so well as a team. Bounce off each other amazingly. All other character make this film as well. I could literally watch this film over and over again. It never gets unfunny which is great. I also think it fit all kinds of ages. Couples, families, singles etc.. My mum is also a huge fan of the film. One thing I would say is that they need to make a number two or something. I think this film is underrated."
"impaledstickfigure","9","1","3","20 June 2016"," An excellent horror/comedy
","Shaun of the Dead is an excellent horror comedy with all the British wit you could ever hope for. The film is littered with quips and one liners that are always good for a laugh. Shaun (Simon Pegg) is an assistant manager at a retail store just floating though life and not trying to accomplish anything special. He lives with two roommates, Ed (Nick Frost) a deadbeat loser, and Pete (Peter Sarafinowicz) a pompous young professional. Liz (Kate Ashfield) is Shaun's girlfriend who dumps him early in the movie due to his gruelingly repetitive life.<br/><br/>A sudden outbreak begins bringing the recently deceased back to life and spreads through bites from the zombies. Shaun and Ed come up with a plan to save Liz and Shaun's mother Barbera (Penelope Wilton). The plan runs into its fair share of comic mishaps through the poor, sometimes purposely sabotaged, execution.<br/><br/>The stereotypical zombie behavior is exploited with great success throughout the movie. Slow zombies are easy enough to walk around or knock over for an easy escape. Run into a herd of zombies? Just shamble through them making zombie noises, they'll never know the difference. In the end Shaun's plan wasn't as good as he had originally thought but he is able to impress Liz enough to win her back.<br/><br/>If you like zombie filled comedies, you would probably also enjoy Zombieland. Another movie full of insults and quips to keep you laughing the whole time."
"areatw","9","1","3","1 June 2016"," The definition of comedy-horror
","'Shaun of the Dead' is as good as comedy-horrors get in my opinion. It perfectly sums up what this genre is all about - violence, gore, a silly storyline and hilarious characters. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old, but it is a timeless classic.<br/><br/>I can't think of many better on-screen doubles than Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They are hilarious in all of the films in which they appear together. This one is probably my personal favourite though, it is brilliantly violent and gory, extremely funny and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is without doubt one of those films that everybody should watch at least once in their lifetime. It is the definition of the comedy-horror genre."
"riordantheking","8","1","3","6 May 2016"," Great comedy film
","Shaun of the Dead is the feature film debut of talented British comedy director Edgar Wright, and while I absolutely adore his other films, I really don't think any of them can really top this one.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg stars as Shaun, last name never given, and he does an excellent job portraying the slight, average, yet comedic side of the character, but also the tormented, dark side of the character, seen most prominently when Shaun is forced to shoot his mother after just watching her die, which is a heart-wrenching scene, as we have grown to love both of these characters. Nick Frost is Ed, Shaun's fat, oafish, lazy room mate, who rarely gets up from the couch. Ed is a funny character to watch, and although he is not a very good person, Nick Frost makes you care about him so when he dies, it's another tear jerker scene. Everyone else does a really good job, I especially love Peter Serafinowicz as Shaun's other room mate Pete, even though he doesn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>The story is comedic and original, portraying what I think a local zombie apocalypse would look like. Edgar Wright's direction sizzles on screen, I particularly love his fast zooms and great background jokes that take a second viewing to get. I also love how the true reason for the zombie apocalypse is never actually revealed, which means that they don't have to force in some scientific jargon to explain the plot.<br/><br/>Does this film have flaws? Sadly, yes, though they are few. Most of the flaws come towards the end. Ed's death was something not foreshadowed anywhere, and all the S.W.A.T members attacking at the end comes out of left field, Shaun really wasn't the hero of the story. But really, other than a few technical goofs, that's it for detractors.<br/><br/>Overall, if you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead, I would highly recommend it."

","You know that feeling when, after dragging yourself through the dregs of modern comedies, you find yourself asking where all the good comedies are? Well, today I realized just how many crappy comedies I'd seen lately and so decided to watch one which I knew was good, but (to my shame) had never seen before: Shaun of the Dead. Much to my delight, it was every bit as good as I'd heard.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) lives together with his best friend, the fat/overweight Ed (Nick Frost). Ed works as an assistant in an electronics store not one block away from his house and Ed...well, Ed sells pot every now and then. They also share the house with Pete, a businessman (of course) who can't tolerate Ed's uselessness. Shaun is having relationship troubles with not only his girlfriend Liz, but also his mom and step-dad. Then the zombie apocalypse breaks out and Shaun will find himself on a journey, not just to survive, but also to repair said relationships. It's fun for the whole family, really.<br/><br/>What's so refreshing about Shaun of the Dead are the amount of visual jokes. Nary a minute goes by without there being a visual gag. So many comedies are reliant on verbal punchlines that it's nice to see a film that's aware of the possibilities of its own medium. The way it repeats these jokes is also brilliant. Shaun walking to work is a classic example: first, he gives a homeless guy some change and the next day, when the homeless guy's zombified, the absent-minded Shaun doesn't notice the difference, so apologizes for the fact he has no change. The way jokes are told purely through framing and editing is also fantastic, like the way it's slowly revealed in the opening scene that Shaun and Liz aren't the only ones sitting at the table.<br/><br/>I do have to say I found the drama a tad overbearing, particularly towards the end. I get that you need a story to prevent the film from becoming an aimless string of jokes, but correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I was watching a great comedy? All of a sudden, everyone and their mothers are dying and it's all a bit too dramatic for my tastes. It's not that these bits are poorly directed or acted; that's not it at all. Rather, it just feels a bit too out of place given the all the great gags that came before.<br/><br/>I also think director/writer Edgar Wright and co-writer Simon Pegg could've done a bit more with the jump-scares. There's a handful of jump-scares that are just...there. Jumpscares are one of the biggest clichés in horror, so it's a pity they didn't find a way to parody them or subvert them in some way.<br/><br/>In the end, the amount of terrific jokes and visual gags are so great in number, any complaints are quickly rendered superfluous. Hot Fuzz, here I come!"
"jaimewombolt","Null","1","3","2 November 2015"," Shaun of the Dead
","Simon Pegg plays Shaun, your typical not so grown up, grown up. Shaun lives with his roommate, has been recently dumped by his girlfriend, and is constantly in contact with his drug dealing, video gaming addict, best friend, Ed, played by Nick Frost. His daily routine consists of his crappy sales job and often ends at the local pub. However, his happy-not so happy life is brought to an abrupt change as the dead began walking the Earth in search for human flesh. Shaun is quickly placed in a situation where his ability to plan and take charge is changed from not so much responsibility, to being in charge of himself, half-witted best friend, his mother, his now ex-girlfriend, and her two friends as they fight to stay alive. <br/><br/>This specific film reminds me of an old 1985 classic, The Return of the Living Dead. The idea behind each film is a carefree refusal of growing up until faced with the moment of no return. In both films, the characters are carefree and ready to party, that is until all ""hell"" breaks lose. In which case, the characters realize that living is not all fun and games and it is necessary to make decisions and take actions in order to live ones life. <br/><br/>One of the strongest techniques used in this film was that of invisible and off-screen noise. Just as in The Return of the Living Dead, this technique gives the viewer a better understanding of what it was the characters were facing and going through during this terrifying, yet somehow, comedic event. In the long run, both of these films took a frightening situation and turned it into something fun to watch, while also driving a deeper thought into the viewing audience, that at some point in your life, you simply have to grow up."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","1","3","7 February 2015"," A good movie, but not as good as people make it out to be
","Shaun of the Dead is peculiar film because everyone seems to love it and say it is hilarious, yet there is very little in the film to actually laugh at.<br/><br/>The movie follows the premise of a man who is 100% clueless that the zombie apocalypse is happening around him and it isn't until too late that he realizes and must band together with his friends to find a safe place to hideout.<br/><br/>This sounds like a funny concept, and it is a funny concept, but it never really does anything funny with it... or interesting for that matter. What makes Shaun of the Dead interesting is that it could almost be a legit zombie film, if only it had more zombie action. This is what makes the movie oddly obnoxious is that: It is never really funny and it is never really a zombie film... it is lukewarm. Mixing genres is always a great thing as long as you can get both genres in. This movie is neither a good comedy or a good zombie movie so it becomes disappointing to watch.<br/><br/>The movie definitely starts out with some good laughs and the first 20 minutes of the movie are genuinely interesting. The build to the zombie apocalypse is great, but the actually pay-off isn't all that good.<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest issues is that the movie plays and feels like a British TV show (it is a British movie, after all) but it is shot a filmed more like a TV special than it is an actual film. That might be a nitpick, but towards the end of the film its campiness and dialogue starts to become really forced. A lot of the jokes towards the end fall flat and the entire movie tries to get a lot of intense ""character interaction"" in one room, but none of it works. It just feels like a TV show script where people are yelling at each other for the sake of pointless drama.<br/><br/>Overall, not a horrible film, but not a really great one. The movie can never fully pick a genre and ends up taking neither genre. I really wanted to find this film funny, but only a few jokes could make me chuckle."

","""It's just one of those days when you're feeling a little... dead."" I really don't know how to describe Shaun of the Dead, except it's a comedy... with zombies. There's been other movies since it that morphed zombies with comedy like Fido and the great Zombieland. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost lead the cast as two lazy roommates. Together with Simon's ex-girlfriend, mom and another couple they try to survive a zombie apocalypse. What I really love about this movie is the humor isn't to in your face; at least not all the time. Pegg and Frost have great chemistry on screen together and Kate Ashfield is really good too. This is one of those movies that is really easy to love. The dialog is funny and the characters fire back at each other quickly. Sometimes fast dialog comes off as annoying, but here it really works. I'd have to say this is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made; be it a straight horror or a comedy. Most zombie movies feel lame and uninspired because there's only so much you can do with zombies. Movies like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland have really breathed new life into the genre though. Shaun of the Dead is really fun to watch and a truly hilarious movie."

","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is hands down one of the finest and funniest send-ups in the history of Horror. Oh, there've been other outstanding examples- like Roman Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS or the Mel Brooks monsterpiece YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, to cite but two-, but not so many that SHAUN OF THE DEAD gets lost in the shuffle (zombies shuffle...). In fact, like many of the very best parodies, this one boasts production values far superior to most of the type of movies it pokes fun at. From beginning to end, it's played straight and THAT above all else is its funniest aspect; it's by no means a stupid tongue-in-cheek wink-wink, nudge-nudge kind of movie. If you're tired of all the ""straight"" stuff shuffling around out there, try SHAUN OF THE DEAD."
"SapphirePanther","10","1","3","14 May 2014"," Classic zomcom that's a definite must see.
","Shaun of the Dead was released in 2004, directed by my favourite director Edgar Wright. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost lead the cast in this zomcom movie based on Shaun (Simon Pegg) a man in his late 20's trying to prove himself and regain his girlfriend and family's trust in him by leading them in a survival of a zombie apocalypse. The music used throughout the movie is really fitting, completely setting in with the movie. This is a particular thing that I always pick up on with Edgar Wrights movies, the music is always perfectly suited and to me that's somewhat important as you don't want to watch a movie with a random misplaced track playing, even that minor detail can ruin the feel of a movie for someone. There is a great attention to detail, for example; Shaun's T-shirt gradually becomes more bloodied throughout the movie, people who are turning into the zombies starts to look visually weaker as the process of the deadly virus starts to kick in and plenty more but I don't want to go into the movie too far and spoil it too much. The story flowed smoothly but was choppy in the way some scenes were edited to be, not in a bad way at all. It's actually a way in which I personally like and it's the approach in which Edgar Wright seems to take with the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy films which consists of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World's End. Overall, Shaun of the Dead is an amazing zomcom with a mixture of hilarious comedy that sets in incredibly well with the horror of the zombies and the sadness of the loss of people close to them. This movie has became a classic and rightly so. If you are wondering whether to watch this or not, I encourage you to as it is an all time definite must watch."

","Shaun Of The Dead is one of the greatest Horror Comedies of all time and an Excellent Zombie film that is filled with great direction,tons of zombies,hilarious laughs,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script and a terrific film score. All of those elements make Shaun Of The Dead one of my favorite Zombie films and an unforgettable Cult Classic.<br/><br/>Set in London,England,Shaun Of The Dead tells the story of Shaun(Simon Pegg),a sales man that doesn't have many ambitions in his life and is having problems with his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield)and trying to sort his life out. Even though Shaun is having problems,they only get worse cause now Shaun has to deal with a Zombie outbreak that's happening in London meaning that Shaun has to fight off the Living Dead and try to get to a local pub and have a cold beer.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead is easily one of the funniest Horror Comedies of all time and is the first in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy(or Blood And Ice Cream Trilogy or Cornetto Trilogy)and is a film that hilarious from beginning to end. It's a movie that takes the Zombie movie genre and uses the genre for over the top laughs and funny Humor that just never stops and after you watch the film your stomach will be hurting so much from laughter that happens throughout the film and the laughs making Shaun Of The Dead a classic Horror Comedy that ranks alongside other classic Horror Comedies such as Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn,The Return Of The Living Dead,An American Werewolf In London,Re-Animator and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive just to name a few.. One of the main reasons Shaun Of The Dead is such a great film and Cult Classic is because director and co-writer Edgar Wright and lead actor,star and co-writer Simon Pegg have given viewers a silly and hilarious Zombie movie that pays homage and tribute to Zombie movies of the past such as George A. Romero's films and other great Zombie films while at the same time mocking the Zombie and giving viewers a movie that is creative and hilarious and original as well as stylish and imaginative. The Comedy and laughs in the film are funny,wild and over the top with tons of jokes,dialog and moments in the film that are smart and inventive but is also offbeat and weird and the laughs will have viewers in tears thanks to the main characters and the way they reacts to situations whether it's dealing with Zombies or themselves. The Comedy in SOTD is also very subtle and clever with great and fun references to classic Horror and Zombie movies that came before this film and the references will go over most viewers heads when you first watch SOTD but will be recognized and noticeable with multiple viewings. What's also great about SOTD is that there are moments that are played in a straight forward manner so the film doesn't become a Spoof or Parody. Although SOTD is a Comedy it never forgets that it's a Horror film as well because there is a few moments where the movie can be suspenseful and intense and can make you jump out of your seat. The main character is an amazing character because he is an unlikely hero that would be able to deal with trying to help his friends and loved ones survive the Zombie Apocalypse with all of the problems he's having in his personal life. As the film goes on we see Shaun start to grow as a leader and man and it's done in a funny and some times serious way with great character development that isn't always seen in Zombie films and you root for Shaun to succeed. The Zombies in SOTD are wonderful and are influenced by George A. Romero's films because like in Romero's film's they look like regular people you see on the street. The way the Zombies are used in the film is masterful and hilarious and will you rolling on the floor laughing. The screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg is truly brilliant and filled with amazing and hilarious dialog that is memorable and done in a rapid fire pace that is funny and ingenious and will stay with you after you watch it. The violence and gore in SOTD is bloody and grisly at times but is done in a comedic way so you won't take it seriously. The ending of the film is great,funny and surprising and will put a smile on lots of viewers faces. A wonderful conclusion to this film.<br/><br/>The whole cast is great in their roles. Simon Pegg is excellent and hilarious as Shaun,the hero of the film,with Pegg bringing laughs and likability to the role. Kate Ashfield is amazing and funny as Liz,Shaun's girlfriend and has great scenes with Pegg. Nick Frost is brilliant and laugh out loud funny as Ed,Shaun's best friend and roommate and has hilarious scenes with Pegg. Lucy Davis is fantastic as Dianne,a friend of Liz's. Dylan Moran is terrific as David,Dianne's jerk boyfriend. Penelope Wilton is delightful as Barbara,Shaun's Mother. Bill Nightly is great Phillip,Shaun's Step Father. Jessica Stevenson is outstanding as Yvonne,Shaun's friend. Peter Serafinowicz is hilarious as Pete,Shaun and Ed's roommate.<br/><br/>The direction by Edger Wright is brilliant and stylish,with Wright always moving the camera with tracking shots,zooms,close-ups giving the film a great atmosphere. Amazing direction,Wright.<br/><br/>The score by Daniel Mudford and Pete Woodhead is fantastic,suspenseful and eerie while at the same time full of energy matching the tone of the film. Wonderful score by Mudford and Woodhead. There is also great song by Queen called Don't Stop Me Now,which is used in a hilarious scene<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Edgar Wright,Horror Films,Comedies,Zombie Films or Genre films or films in general,I highly suggest you see Shaun Of The Dead,an Excellent and Hilarious Zombie Horror Comedy and Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","As I am no fan of sci-fi stuff, I am very selective in watching related films (I try to avoid films with lots of sophisticated technology achievements and vocabulary). But I have enjoyed films with Simon Pegg's participation - and I did not have to be disappointed this time as well. He is not only a talented actor, but he has a certain twisted mind for partaking in peculiar works where real fun and amusement lie in background actions and/or witty comparisons. Pegg's character is Shaun, an ordinary and childlike man attempting to get some kind of focus in his life as he deals with his best friend, neighbour, girlfriend, mother and stepfather - all of them having their own problems and odd concepts (skillfully played by British character actors). At the same time, Shaun has to combat an uprising of zombies, begin to take decisions both for himself and the others; but he will still remain (almost) an ordinary citizen, not fabulous superman for couple of hours as we see in most similar U.S. movies.<br/><br/>The plot is strong and smooth, many scenes and lines make you giggle, and politically incorrect ending scenes are really enjoyable.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","10 December 2012"," Surprisingly good zombie comedy
","Zombie apocalypse as joke material is really nothing new. In broad daylight the slow and mumbling undead are actually pretty pathetic sight as long as you don't let them get too close. I still don't think that the subject matter has ever been approached quite this way. Because when you really look at it, in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies aren't the source of the comedy, they're actually a credible threat to the everyday joes that inhabit this film. Rather most of the humour in this film stems from the sheer stupidity of mankind. Because let's face it, many of us wouldn't make it for a day if the gates of hell were to be opened. But there would be some individuals, who against all odds would survive through sheer dumb luck. And that's this film.<br/><br/>The director, Edgar Wright, along with the two main actors, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, would later go on to make Hot Fuzz, one of my favourite comedies of all time, and a lot of the same ideas show up in this film. The same bland non-interest in the face of danger, bizarre circumstances happening in the background and the absolutely brilliant interaction between Pegg and Frost are the saving graces of this film, along with the usual zombie jokes that you'd expect from a film like this.<br/><br/>This isn't Hot Fuzz, however, though it's still rather good. What I think it misses are likable main characters. The main characters in this film are really, really urban and bland. They're so boring and so lost in their everyday lives, not to mention the zombie apocalypse, that it's hard to root for them. I found myself cheering for the zombies occasionally when some of the more obnoxious characters were killed. Whether or not this was intentional, I don't know, but it does the film no favours.<br/><br/>That's my personal interests interfering with my viewing experience, though, because I've never really liked these kinds of characters that are so helpless and so socially awkward that even the local computer nerds pick on them. Some might find them hilarious, however, so I can't really call it a flaw of the film. It's just not something that appeals to me.<br/><br/>Aside from that grievance, the film is very good. The plot twists are very unexpected, but in a good way, the action scenes are not bad and the story, while a bit weird in some parts, manages to work, for some incomprehensible reason. Any fan of zombie parody should definitely give this one a watch."

","""The tyranny of a prince in an oligarchy is not so dangerous to the public welfare as the apathy of a citizen in a democracy."" - Charles de Montesquieu <br/><br/>Edgar Wright directs ""Shaun of the Dead"", a spoof of George Romero's ""serious"" zombie series and the ""comedic"" zombie movies of John A. Russo's ""Return of the Living Dead"" franchise. The film flattens and cheapens the politics of Romero's work, but is faster, funnier, slicker and more affable than all of Russo's.<br/><br/>While Romero's films went out of their way to encapsulate the social and political mores of different decades (""Night of the Living Dead"" 1960s America, ""Dawn of the Dead"" the 1970s, ""Day of the Dead"" the 80s, ""Land of the Dead"" the 90s, ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Survival of the Dead"" the first two decades of the 21st century), what ""Shaun"" says is more unconscious: the modern world breeds zombies and stifles ambition, being a zombie hampers upward mobility, upward mobility is necessary to draw in women, and women are all that rescue zombie spouses from total, slothful zombiedom (the film's climactic dues ex machina even features an army being led by a woman). Meanwhile, all couples embrace being zombies and all eventually become content in their zombie society, as all heavy work is outsourced to lesser zombies, freeing middle-class zombies to work in their white collar zombie society and watch zombie TV and play zombie video games. The film advocates zombiedom, because all zombie man and his zombie audience want, in their shared perpetual stupor, is media stimulation, sex, a relatively non-taxing 9 to 5 job, and various consumer pleasures. You are fine being a zombie, you want to be a zombie, being a zombie is good, is easy, as long as you have electricity, a wedding ring, and other zombies are doing all the manual labour. Unlike Romero's films, all this is sanctioned rather than presented as being abhorrent. See the 2007 remake of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", which likewise embraces defeatism, and advocates that its cast and audience become alien pod-people; you're better off without your brain. Submit.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the recent ""Zombieland"" does exactly what ""Shaun of the Dead"" does, using zombies as being representative of an aching longing for 1980s consumerism (the sweet, ""brainless"" embrace of video games, Atari, Ghostbusters, Bill Murry, 80s fantasy etc). Contrast this to Romero's ""Land of the Dead"".<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Though very funny and stylish, this is sitcom level drama and humour. Worth two viewings."
"zardoz-13","10","1","3","1 November 2011"," The Funniest Zombie Comedy Ever!!!
","Director Edgar Wright's romantic splatter comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" qualifies as the funniest zombie movie ever made. This hilarious apocalyptic epic follows the antics of Foree Electric salesman Shaun (Simon Pegg of ""Hot Fuzz"") his girlfriend Liz, ((Kate Ashfield), his best mate Ed (Nick Frost of ""Paul"") along with their assorted friends, and Shaun's parents as they struggle to survive in an England overrun by zombies. The action takes place in one neighborhood and doesn't last for more than a week. <br/><br/>The first twenty minutes sets up everything as our heroes remain blissfully ignorant about the enormity of the events occurring around them. Shaun and his girlfriend Liz have just broken up because he cannot seem to take her out anywhere without them ending up in a tavern called the Winchester. She hates the Winchester because Shaun takes her there all the time, and she wants variety in her life. When Shaun reminds that he took Liz to Greece, she points out that Greece was where they met! When the zombies finally invade the apartment that Shaun and Ed share with their mate Pete, our heroes have nowhere else to go but out. The first zombie who barges in is a one-armed fellow in a wedding tuxedo and he manages to effect entry because Shaun has forgotten for the last time to shut the door to their apartment. Afterward, they discover another zombie in their backyard; it's a girl named Mary and Nick shoves her so that she falls down on a pipe and impales herself. Naturally, Shaun's mother Barbara phones and informs him that his father Philip (Bill Nighy of ""Underworld"") isn't feeling well. <br/><br/>Shaun and Ed fight their way out of the apartment, appropriate Pete's car, and careen off with careen off with Ed at the wheel to Barbara's place, knocking down any zombie unfortunate enough to cross the path of their car. Initially, Shaun and Ed have it all planned out. In Shaun's imagination, they kill Philip and rescue his mom, and wind up back in Shaun's apartment with our hero drinking from a white mug with the word Cool on it. When they realize that they cannot return to their blood-splattered apartment, they end up at the Winchester Tavern. Things don't work out as they had expected. They wind up packing Mum and Philip into Philip's Mercedes. During this fateful drive, Philip reminds Shaun that he met him when Shaun was 12. Nick races over to Liz's apartment where Shaun persuades his ex-girlfriend along with David (Dylan Moran) and Dianne (Lucy Davis)to accompany Ed and his relatives to the Winchester. When they rush out to the Jaguar, David is wielding an umbrella while Shaun deploys a cricket bat.<br/><br/>Our heroes have to abandon their car at one point and hike through twenty backyards. When they come to within sight of the the Winchester Tavern, Shaun warns them that the zombies have the establishment surrounded and besieged. Our heroes impersonate zombies so they can get through the crowd of walkers and inside the Winchester. Eventually, Shaun brandishes the rifle, but the zombies pour into the pub, and the chances of the protagonists surviving is considerably remote.<br/><br/>Half of the hilarity about ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the way that Wright stages the actions and edits it together for maximum comic impact. Simon Pegg is frantically funny as Shaun and Nick Frost adds to the laughs, especially at the end. Despite the obviously humorous subject matter, Wright has not balked at incorporating the splatter effects of most grade Z zombie flicks. Mind you, they emphasize the horrible spectacle of death in all the action scenes when the zombie tear into their victims with their teeth and at one point, Wright pays tribute to George Romero's ""Day of the Dead"" as one fellow has his entire stomach torn apart in a crowd of ravenous zombies. George Romero applauded ""Shaun of the Dead"" and this smart British production ranks as the best zombie comedy ever with snappy pacing and first-rate performances, particularly Bill Nighy as Philip."

","This is my review of Shaun of the dead. It is a horror/comedy that is very enjoyable to watch. It mixes my two favorite genres together to make a very laughable blood fest. <br/><br/>This movie is about two friends (pegg and frost) who live together. They live boring lives until one day a zombie outbreak strikes. Of course like any other zombie movie it does not say how the infection started it just kind of appears. They do their best to survive the infestation they face by rounding up friends and going to their favorite pub.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with laughs from pegg and frost (very good actors in comedies in my opinion) and it is also filled with lots of blood and gore to keep to the traditional zombie movie style.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth a watch. I kind of think they should make another movie with the same characters but make it a vampire comedy and call it from dusk till shaun. What does everyone think?"

","This movie I saw by accident and went into it with no idea what to expect...a horror/comedy movie....didn't think either would work. BUT I was very wrong, the movie speaking takes a couple minutes to get used to (due to heavy accents) but after that it's a very enjoyable movie over and over with many parts that bring tears to your eyes you laugh so hard. <br/><br/>The plot is the typical zombie movie but with a funny angle and good acting. Don't want to really say anymore than that since don't want to give any spoilers. But again would HIGHLY recommend sitting through this movie at least once if you haven't seen it yet."
"prateak09","9","1","3","9 May 2011"," Best horror-comedy I've ever seen...
","Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B- class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.<br/><br/>British humor, how I love it! ""Shaun Of The Dead"" is full of it. For everyone to know, this isn't a simple spoof of Dawn Of The Dead(as the name implies) , it's more a romantic comedy that just so happens to be littered with the Zombies(or zom-rom-com) a self-proclaimed new genre, who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered). Let me make clear right at the beginning that you don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy it. You just need to have the right sense of humour. This is a mixture of almost every genre you can imagine. There's a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, some horror and, as I said, LOTS of humor! spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. The movie is clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific. The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant. ""Shaun of the Dead"" has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.<br/><br/>The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as my favorite, the old record collection that Shaun (Simon Pegg) and ED (Nick Frost) insanely used to throw at two oncoming zombies, and at the same time, the methodical and selective process of which albums they wanted to throw and which they wanted to keep! ""Dire Straits?"" ""Chuck it!"", or when Shaun and his friends beat up an elderly zombie in the pub using cricket bats, all to the rhythm of Don't Stop Me Now by Queen. I can't even begin to emphasise how cool this British film is. The amount of time it takes for Shaun and Ed to realise anything's wrong is priceless. This is as about as original as it gets. They actually manage to pull off humour, violence, decapitations, action, romance, suspense, sadness and joy all within the space of 90 minutes! The ending is hilarious, something you'll have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The acting is just brilliant and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. I've always been a huge fan of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their real life friendship really helps in their reel life chemistry. Anytime they're together on-screen, they just shine. Plus of course it has the wonderful Bill Nighy playing a role in it. This guy really is a terrific actor that always is at his best in comical roles like he plays in this movie.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is really good looking. The gore, make-up and visual effects are extremely good and are even something that I haven't even seen in 'serious' Zombie/horror flicks. For a low budget film, the zombies are pretty menacing looking and there are some genuinely scary moments to be found in the movie. There's also several touching scenes between Shaun and his mum and dad...sorry, I mean step-dad(you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie).<br/><br/>There isn't really anything negative I can think of in the film. Even the action is well handled, with enough gore to satisfy any fans of zombie flicks. From beginning to end, the whole mood and the whole atmosphere continue to deliver and to entertain from moment to moment. This is NOT a spoof film, this is a unique take on the zombie genre from a British viewpoint, with a lot of humor and obvious satire thrown in, for good measure. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a must see film which showcases Simon Pegg's talents excellently. You'll be laughing the whole time. I give it 8 out of 10."
"jnguyen46117","9","1","3","21 March 2011"," Shaun of the Dead: 9/10
","Nick Frost and Simon Pegg were delightful in this parody-like British zombie flick. Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a TV store senior staff (or oldest) who had gone nowhere with his life. His 3-year relationship with his girlfriend just ended and he had no idea what his next move is. In the beginning of the film, you see the director trying to foreshadow upcoming events like flashing the news and the radio. After all of that, Shaun and his friends still got no idea that zombies were coming to town. Finding out that they were possibly going to die, Shaun decided to go to a safe place, The Winchester, the bar that he and Ed (Frost) always goes to for comfort. Also deciding to pick up his mom and his ex-girlfriend, Shaun battled through a pile of bloody zombies in a brilliant way. Walking through the streets as though they were zombies, hitting a zombie in a musical rhythm, and missing as he shoots the zombies are great work of director Edgard Wright. It's got a feeling of sensation from Dawn of the Dead, but it also has witty humor from its characters unlike most other zombie flick. Shaun is an uptight store manager that wants to get his life together. Ed is a fat loser who lives with Shaun and play video games all day. When they're together, funny. Even though I stress on how funny it is, Shaun of the Dead is still a horror film with much appreciation for the bloody gore and scares that a typical zombie flick has."

But in this film ""Shaun of the Dead""? Those things become absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie was very funny and it's safe to say it was worth to watch. Just one thing I was little confused is the movie contained some sad scenes which never turned into funny occasion. I expected a whole movie is just comedy and nothing more, so I thought it might be better if they just eliminated the sad scenes.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you are looking for some grade B horror movies, go rent the other movies, this is not you are expecting.

","I heard of this movie a couple times but never saw it cause I thought it would be like all the rest of the ""make fun of horror movies"" type of film. I bought this movie at a used DVD store just because it was on sale and thought I might as well see it. It is by far one of the creepiest AND funniest movies that ever came into the film world. After you see this, you WILL understand why it's on the top 250 list of IMDb.com. The all British cast made this movie even more wonderful than if it was an all American cast. I honestly have never laughed so hard at a movie and yet been so freaked out at the same time. The only little ""problem"" I had was the ending is that it just wasn't how I thought it would have ended but it was pretty funny. None the less it is a good ending and a great movie. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies and comedies. The idea that all of a sudden there is a scary moment and then all of a sudden a joke comes out of no where is the perfect combination, especially for this cast and this production crew. The movie is about an hour and a half long and I only wish there had been a little more, maybe just another half an hour. It would completely be worth it. Every little moment and coincidences are extremely deliberate and it's fits so wonderfully. So once again, in conclusion, and so on and so forth... this movie is a must see for really anybody who can accept the same amount of scary and funny in one movie."
"alienworlds","Null","1","3","23 July 2010"," Good but not excellent
","The filmmakers really played on the fact that British people are often impossible to good effect within the parameters of this movie. Unfortunately the way in which British people are frequently impossible is not always something you can forgive, and that element makes this film good but not excellent. That someone could be every annoying thing and not be also considered a form of evil is maybe what this film is mocking, so maybe it is further ahead of the curve than I am giving it initial credit for. Good acting from the team of actors that also made the film Hot Fuzz, which is the better film to me. I found the annoying traits that are played upon in this movie to be a bit much at about the one hour point, but like I said maybe they are trying to make fun of just how irritating people can be, as they are in effect personifying evil by having so many traits that are supposedly there to ward away evil. That nothing is ever said about anything is pure England, and is like dealing with the just deceased in a way, and that the continuous counter reaction of everything is fine, when it most definitely is not, has the ultimate effect of destroying every scrap of possible good in a situation. Good zombie film, funny in places, with an interesting and intelligent sardonic sub text."

The balance is important and they get it spot on so there is something for everyone.<br/><br/>The two main characters chemistry is perfect (they are friends in real life) which is an important part to making the film work.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic but it does keep you interested even though it is really a stupid zombie film for which there are hundreds to choose from.<br/><br/>This is not really a zombie film but a comedy with zombies in it. There is violence but it mostly for the comedy effect.<br/><br/>One of the best comedies ever never mind British comedy; a must see."
"Sanou_san","10","1","3","15 March 2010"," Disgusting and entertaining
","I guess I got already inoculated by previous ""zombie"" movies I've seen, all of them coated with serious story lines. Some were convincingly magnificent (e.g. Dawn of the Dead), some are slightly stupid (like 28 weeks later), while others where plain stupid but entertaining (such as Land of the Dead). But when it comes to disgust and entertainment, as far as I can remember, Braindead had made laugh almost to death, while the rest of my friends squirmed and screamed in disgust watching it. This is the first time I saw a British film that made this zombie hype excitingly and worthily watchable. Since I saw Simon Pegg first in Hot Fuzz I know he excelled well more enough in Shaun of the Dead. He's performance here is even deeper. His comedic talent isn't saturated to the extent of impairing his dramatic abilities. Nevertheless the film worked well. It was hilariously charming and plain, simple scary. The cast were also awesome, see Kate Ashfield there for example. She's a straightforward, understanding, simple and frank girlfriend of Shaun (Simon Pegg), but just like Ed, Diane, David and the rest of the cast swayed me with their offhand and persuading performances. The comedy and bit of drama was cool. It mixed well how the story of the film progressed, very much anticipating. But if I were to compare its cheesy factor of horror zombie flick familiarity I guess Braindead was cheesier in that term. But the rest was cool and brilliant. I deem it's cooler than the latter. I've watched this film few times and I get to love the character more and more. It never wears out for my taste."
"tlso1987","10","1","3","21 February 2010"," The first good parody movie in years
","Since Mel Brooks' days of satire, parody as a genre has been just about limited to the mass-produced ""from the makers of Scary Movie"" films - in which scenes from the films they parody are re-staged, but with groin kicks and fart jokes.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead, rather, brings parody back to life by playing around with the genre it parodies. In this treatment of the zombie movie, the main characters barely notice anything's changed - why would they, when there's issues with the landlord, the girlfriend, and the stepdad? It's only when someone's about to have a bite taken out of them that anyone reacts to the oncoming apocalypse.<br/><br/>The reason Shaun of the Dead works is that instead of just looking for holes in movies to make fun of, it presents itself as just another one of the movies that it parodies. And with the comedies Hot Fuzz and Spaced under their belts, I can say that Edgar Wright, his cast, and crew are the most competent satirists of the past decade."
"mouse712","10","1","3","15 February 2010"," Utterly Brilliant
","When my brother decided we were going to watch Shaun of the Dead, my initial reaction was ""Oh God, this should be a load of rubbish."" Well, how very wrong I was. Shaun (Pegg) is your typical no-hope loser with family problems, work problems, girlfriend problems and friend problems. However, he transforms into a warped version of a hero when zombies attack.<br/><br/>The first half is brilliantly scripted, with many a laugh-out-loud line and great delivery from Pegg and Frost, who worked together very well. The all star cast of British legends, such as Bill Nighty, Dylan Moran and Nicola Cunningham, work very well too. Frost was particularly good and I found I was quoting his lines for days afterwards.<br/><br/>However, as Shaun suddenly realises he's in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, we change from this laugh-a-minute comedy to a very well performed action/horror film. Pegg's acting is outstanding, especially during the scenes when he mum is dying. The visual effects were top-notch too - I was glad to see they didn't go down the traditional 'obvious fake blood' route and I found myself truly believing that they were surrounded by zombies. The extras should be credited too, because they were very convincing. But the comedic value still isn't lost, and I found that I was laughing, crying and cowering in fear all at the same time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you watch this film, even if zombies aren't for you. Truly one of Britain's greats."

His roommate Ed looks up to him--when he can take his eyes off the TV, that is. Liz is re-evaluating their relationship, particularly after Shaun fails to do something special for their anniversary on Saturday. That day, there are train delays, people fainting in the streets, TV news reporters on unexplained calamities. No, it can't be--but it is--the dead have risen. Saturday's isolated incidents mushroom into a full-on zombie assault and, once daylight breaks, it's Sunday bloody Sunday. As manners and flesh take a beating, it's time to separate men from meat, humans from zombies, and living from undead. Shaun and Ed grab whatever is at hand to repel the attacking zombies, summoning reserves of strength they didn't know they possessed and straining muscles they forgot they had. Rounding up friends and family, they press on towards the sanctuary of the Winchester. All that stands in their way are hordes of the flesh-eating undead.<br/><br/>This movie is not scary at all (like Braindead aka Dead Alive which is scary then this movie) but this movie did have some very gory scenes which i really like.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely hilarious! from start to end, there also added some drama in this movies not too much but mainly focused on the jokes.

"RichardKleiner","10","1","3","7 November 2009"," A new classic!
","I'm not a George A. Romero fan. Putrid ex-people tearing flesh with their teeth is not my idea of fine film-making, still, what seems to appease critics is the social commentary found on Romero's ""Saga of the Dead"". Either way, the filmmaker's revolutionary concept of horror and zombies spawned a new generation of movies that made their attempts to either honor Romero or improve his work. 28 Days Later may be the best example of the latter. However, most of those zombie flicks are known for being schlocky, formulaic and tasteless, particularly Resident Evil.<br/><br/>This homage to George Romero, by British comedians Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, is one of few that takes the concept to another direction. The script actually isn't focused on the zombie invasion at all. Shaun is a frustrated man with a job that goes nowhere, a friend that, while a faithful companion, only drags him further back, domestic problems with his mother and stepfather and, most importantly, a turbulent relationship with Liz, who's fed up with Shaun's lack of motivation, and threatens to leave him. All of this happens while an apocalyptic phenomenon strikes London, where people stop living and turn into flesh eating zombies.<br/><br/>Wright and Pegg blend this strange mix up of genres so brilliantly that it honors it's tagline ""rom com zom"" and becomes unique in it's kind.<br/><br/>It's not the ""Airplane"" style of parody, which usually means a pointless story made up with the sole purpose of making fun of a specific genre of films. It actually tells a really serious tale. Most people may not get that this whole horrifying zombie phenomenon actually helps Shaun in moving on and leaving his no good lifestyle behind. The tragic loss of his mother and Ed makes a necessary change on Shaun, as he no longer has someone to drag him back to his frustrated routine life.<br/><br/>The reason of the wide appeal of this film is it's versatility. Romero fans while find it a laugh riot, people who have never seen a zombie movie in their lives while find it extremely amusing, the cinematic homages by Edgar Wright are quite funny to the educated film scholar, and the technical aspects are quite flawless for film critics.<br/><br/>It's a favorable stereotype the fact that British humor is light years ahead of American or much farther of Mexican humor. The jokes found in Shaun of the Dead are original, creative and most likely never to be repeated again. Had this film be made by incompetent hacks passing as writers in America, the jokes might have been vulgar and with stupid punchlines. There are scenes that aren't just incredibly funny but their creation is technically ground breaking, like Shaun's two trips to the store done on a single shot each. Since I'm no Romero fan, the homages went largely unnoticed for me (unlike Hot Fuzz), but that doesn't affect the fine technical mastery involved in the film.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you love zombie films or hate them, the innovation in this British comedy will make the most avid living dead genre detractor thrilled and off their seat with laughter. Along with Hot Fuzz, a must have."

","Meet Shaun. He's kind of stuck in a boring job, his best friend's a bit childish, his girlfriend is on the verge of leaving him, and he's not his father... sorry, *step* dad's biggest fan. Oh, also, the walking dead(we don't use the zed-word!) just attacked where he lives. In this pastiche of the horror genre, there are actually proper scares, terrifying sequences and well-established creepy atmosphere. The laughs are the main point, and this does garner a ton of them, with cleverness, black and/or British humor, *incredible* subtlety, silliness and satire. This moves a mile a minute, with excellent pacing, never overstimulating, and slowing down here and there, occasionally including some impeccably genuine, true and heartfelt drama and back-story. The characters are credible, well-written and fleshed(pun intended) out very nicely. This is dense with detail, and warrants re-watching. The actors have definite talent(nearly every performance is flawless), in addition to being *extremely* funny. Pegg, Ashfield, Frost, Nighy, etc., all of them, astounding in both respects. I'm rather impressed that the transition from television(I have not yet been able to catch any of Spaced, but I certainly am intending to) went so smoothly and perfectly. Almost everything here works out. The editing and cinematography are marvelous. This is so packed with references to, and spoofs of, stuff in the flicks that inspired it. I implore you, make sure to have seen the George A. Romero's trilogy concerning the subject, as well as the three Evil Dead movies before this. Reservoir Dogs, too. The dialog is magnificent, well-delivered and utterly quotable. This has a great plot that develops well throughout. The special effects are amazing, completely convincing. There is frequent strong language, some disturbing content and a lot of bloody violence and gore in this. The DVD holds a commentary track by Simon and Edgar(do note that they cuss, and are in general... outspoken, in it) which is absolutely worth the time, deleted scenes with the option of hearing the thoughts behind cutting them, featurettes(a couple of them have pages here on the site, and I will review them there), outtakes, make-up tests, a SFX comparison production, trailers for the film and photo galleries. They're all well-produced. I recommend this to any fan of romantic comedies with zombies. 8/10"

If you've seen Spaced, or missed out on this and saw Hot Fuzz, you know the team of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is always going to be immensely entertaining, smart and hilarious. This is not a spoof, as much as it is an homage, as is Hot Fuzz. Where this is an homage to films like of course, Dawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is an homage to 70's and 80's action films. This film has something for everybody and it has hit it to the tee for me. This movie is absolutely perfect and is one of my favorite films of all time. The true-to-life relationship between Shaun and Ed with Shaun and Liz. All of the cast is perfectly chosen while the rest of the film has you either laughing, crying or in a bittersweet state. The feelings you get from this movie is a feeling you should get from just about every great, classic comedy: Happy and completely enthralled into the plot.

Danny Boyle's 28 Days later portrayed a horrifying prospect of a country subjected to a rage virus and the director created some breathtaking scenery by deserting the capital for atmospheric purposes. Even Stanley Kubrick's the Shining was filmed partly in Britain and that is perhaps one of the most renowned horrors today, along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The last couple of years we have seen more teen horrors than we need from The Hole, to Donkey Punch and recent release Tormented, we get the general picture of teen angst juxtaposed with some blood thank you and so, here, we have a brand new vision, horror with a wonderful spurt of comedy.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead is a rarity, the comic pairing of Frost and Pegg will never be appreciated enough and the quick, very quick, montages of Edgar Wright's bring astounding appreciation to the viewers.<br/><br/>The release brings around a wonderful collection of justification to a variety of meaningful topics such as relationships, parenthood, friendship and survival with a wonderful inspirational get your life together ideology. The fact the scripting is hitting hard at some important issues, it would seem hard to cram in any type of comedy, but behold the marvel of the pairing of Pegg and Wright.<br/><br/>From throwing classic records at zombies, to the imitations of the dead, this is a comic gem that will consistently make you smile.<br/><br/>Pegg and Frost have become one of Britain's best comedy duos with this film the marker in which they hit the big screen in groundbreaking fashion. From Frost's ape impressions to Pegg's likable loser antics, we can sit back and enjoy the partnership and playful banter between the two actors.<br/><br/>Wright's direction breaks boundaries with the montages but there is a skillful approach to the handling of the zombie attacks. When outside the Winchester there is a very well handled approach to the way the dead are acting and Wright's sublime setup helps adds a chill and a sweet comic touch.<br/><br/>This picture is simply the beginning of the trilogy with Hot Fuzz establishing the actors and directors on to bigger and better things but what a hit Shaun is."
"thomas-hardcastle-2","6","1","3","16 September 2008"," Funny in places, but not as good as most people say...
","I am a big fan of the Spaced series, and Big Train, so I was familiar with Simon Pegg and his excellent writing and acting. I went to see this film at the cinema with a mate who introduced me to Spaced. When we left the cinema, my mate was still buzzing off the film. I was fairly quiet about the whole thing, thinking to myself that the film really could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Sure, they've taken on the zombie movie genre, highlighting the numerous faults with the premise, and along the way they've made us chuckle along. However, this film fails in a number of ways, and could really have been an absolute classic, in Airplane terms.<br/><br/>The primary factor that spoils the movie is the unrealistic nature of Nick Frost's character, and how a friend like him would not be a friend were he to be like he is all the time. He was just too annoying to be accepted and taken as a realistic character. Pegg essentially plays the straight man to Frost's funny man. The biggest contributor to Frost's annoyingly poor character has to be Frost's poor acting, when compared to the rest of the cast. This could be a reflection of the script, which also could have been better, or even a reflection of Edgar Wright, and how he isn't quite there yet with his art, but is close.<br/><br/>Frost spoils the film for me, and for that reason, this film is not in any way a classic. It's worth watching a couple of times, but to be mentioned in the same breath as films like Airplane is something people are too quick to do. It's decent, but not as good as it could have been, with a bit more tweaking and the replacement of Nick Frost with a good actor."
"drink-up-beautiful-X","10","1","3","11 September 2008"," I would not give this movie any less than a 10 out of 10 rating.
","When Spaced hit our screens for the first time in 1999, it became a cult classic everyone was sure Edgar Wright could never top. But less than 5 years later came the masterpiece that is Shaun Of The Dead. What could be seen as a movie take on the oh-so lovable Spaced. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg push things to the limits with this lip biting Romantic Zombie Comedy. <br/><br/>But this film is not your typical hide-behind-your-sofa Zombie movie. In fact when you break this movie down, you realise that the zombies show rather small significance to the main story in which Wright and Pegg try to get across. Therefore this movie is for everybody. It reaches out to all audiences. Even those who's stomach turn at the slight thought of a blood-curdling zombie hacking away at someone can be comforted by the fact that behind all that make-up, the extras come in the forms of professional comedian Joe Cornish and the lovable Michael Smiley better known as his role as Tyres in Spaced. <br/><br/>The brilliant mixture of British humour and irony displayed in this movie is what gives it the edge that separates it from all other movies. Lines such as ""Go live in the shed"" or ""Next time I see him, he's dead"" almost foreshadow the ending of the movie, subtly enough that we may not even realise. <br/><br/>The beauty that comes with this perfectly shot movie is that even from the opening sequence, as each character is brought in one shot at a time, to the end, there isn't an un-quotable, un-memorable and un-lovable moment in it. Moving onto the cutting edge cast that comes with this epic movie, the list is almost endless. From cameos to characters there isn't a single actor missing from this movie. With appearances from Martin Freeman, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Peter Serafinowicz, you'll never feel the need to watch another movie again. <br/><br/>Saving the best to last we come to the dynamic relationship of the movie, between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, in which it's hard to tell where Frost and Pegg's friendship ends and Shaun and Ed's friendship begins. A relationship absolutely crucial to the popularity of the 'Blood And Ice Cream Trilogy'. Did I forget to mention the kick ass soundtrack? No I was just leading up to that part. Every film geek knows a decent soundtrack makes for an even more impressive movie. For example, would The Graduate be half as good without the Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack? No probably not. Opening with The Specials and ending with Lemon Jelly, Wright has achieved an absolute perfect balance to finalise an already perfect movie. Additionally anyone who can say they've watched this movie and don't automatically think of the legendary snooker cube moment when they hear Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' is a liar.<br/><br/>This movie is a not spoof, but a vital tribute to so many well loved Zombie classics and a vitality to our film industry. Shaun Of The Dead is a crucial 'must see' movie and I would not give it any less than a ten out of ten rating."
"aesgaard41","10","1","3","8 May 2008"," Best Horror Comedy in Years
","This is the much funnier and enjoyable comedic version of Night of the Living Dead I'd have created years ago, just far more British. It has several references to the original NOTLD movie and a lot of non-familiar British references. (Do the English really talk like that?) Simon Pegg is a likable loser and his best friend Nick Frost is a likable idiot. Together, they're an incredible comedy team, making this a definite cult classic. I love the recurring gags and the predictable foreshadowing instances plus the character motivations, like Simon fretting and reacting as Nick tosses his prized record collection. A lot of it really is common sense in the face of confusion as well as taking the most difficult way to a solution, the way people really act, and that's what makes this movie in so many ways than one."

","This film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>Shaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction. Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one."

But it's completely comedy film.<br/><br/>All the characters are quite original. Ed's a very fantastic and I laugh at his jokes during all the film. To me, he is the hero of film more than Shaun and already he finishes with an amazing scene. Ed isn't a forgettable man he kids also the hero's fat and stupid friend image. Shaun is also amazing.<br/><br/>It shouldn't be counted as surprise seeing it in IMDb's top 250. It's aim not to criticize just zombie films also the clichés in cinema.

"Rathko","7","1","3","4 September 2007"," Review from a Comedy Snob
","By way of explanation of this review, I should say that I've never been that in to comedies. My wife makes me laugh, my friends make me laugh, even a book can make me laugh, but for some reason the number of movies that make me laugh are very few and far between. 'Shaun of the Dead', for all the hype as being one of the funniest films in years, was amusing throughout, and on several occasions did, in fact, make me laugh, which from this reviewer, is very high praise indeed.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, with Pegg's Shaun leading a who's who of British sitcom actors through zombie infested city streets to hole-up, Romero-style, in a local pub. The zombies are never very scary, and there's never really much of a sense of real peril. The script contains genuine warmth and affection and Pegg and Frost are great, possessing comedic chemistry and timing, but judging from the out-takes, you wish that they would allow themselves the indulgence of diverting from the script, as their improvisational skills are often far funnier than the finished dialogue.<br/><br/>A last act disemboweling is the movie's only real nod to the visceral and messy violence of the genre, as can be judged from its 15-rating in Britain. I feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that England is able to finally produce popular movies without pandering to an American audience, but the lavish praise that has been heaped on this movie seems a little over-the-top. But what can I say? I've just never been that in to comedies."

","I'm not really a fan of zombie films but it recently seems like they've kinda ganged up on me. Shaun of the Dead is therefore a nice breath of fresh air in a genre that has become quite repetitive and self-referencing. What the film does is combine light-hearted comedy but is also a good zombie-film on the side.<br/><br/>The film's definite high-points are its depiction of how people deal with a problem of such a bizarre nature. The human drama in all its cheesiness provides the perfect outlet for the films dark comedy which in turn keeps the film from becoming too serious even during more emotional moments (such as Philip and Mom's deaths).<br/><br/>The film also doesn't fail to see to the needs of zombie fans and actually contains quite a bit of gore. Though it is rather bleak and gory a film, deep down it is actually a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is the quintessential date movie..."
"arthera09","8","1","3","23 July 2007"," good movie with some surprising feeling at the end
","I have to say that this was an excellent zombie film. The biggest problem I have with most zombie movies is that everyone in them is just a cliché, but this movie manages to give each character a pretty well developed entity to work with. Simon Pegg's character is the most rounded and I have to say very well acted. I felt as if I were attacked by zombies this is basically how I would act. The scenes where brevity was needed it was actually well done and that is because the characters were real. When Simon shoots his mother is a surprisingly moving scene. The standoff where funny is actually pretty heart felt. In most movies where a lot of people are going to die I don't care who lives or dies, but I actually cared with Simon Pegg dies nor not. For a while there I thought he was actually going to die, but the ending was good. I think the movie may have been a little more moving if they did actually die, or just leave them going up the elevator. Nick's and Simon's relationship was very well done and Simon's relationships with just about anyone were pretty well rounded. That are not that many times that I mention the special features, but I must say that I loved the plot holes part. It was very funny and it added to the whole attitude that the movie makers took to this movie. This zombie movie succeeds where a lot of other films failed, but putting real people in a silly situation and making them real."

","I wasn't expecting much seeing as i'm not a big fan of zombie movies apart from night of the living dead (1968 version) but I was pleasantly surprised. Basically Simon Pegg plays loser Shaun who lives with his flatmate Ed and has been dumped by his girlfriend. A plague of zombies are attacking the town so he decides to hide in the pub with several (near) friends. This film has a star studded cast (well in my opinion) with the likes of Matt Lucas (little Britain) Bill Nighy ( guest house Paradiso pirates of the Caribbean 2) and Dylan Moran (black books). This movie was funny and slightly frightening as well and had a bit of gore to satisfy the hardcore Romero fans so if you're a fan of zombie films or just a fan of Simon Pegg then watch this film you won't regret it!"
"ZumBLuvR","9","1","3","25 January 2007"," The single best zombie comedy ever made.
","As a living dead fan of 20+ years I tend to not care for films that spoof my beloved genre, however, Shaun is not a spoof in the sense of the word. Shaun is basically an intelligent horror comedy film based in reality. All zombie films are fantasy based, but 9 times out of 10 the settings or characters seem a little unrealistic or focuses on an expertly trained group of soldiers. Shaun does non of this and is probably the first zombie film since the original Night of the Living Dead to bring back the every day man and his struggles during the start of a zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>What separates Shaun from the other dead films is the script. Sharp humor interjected into everyday living situations and everyday living situations played out during a zombie apocalypse make for fantastically funny moments and great entertainment. Plus you have Edgar Wrights own social commentary in how we as a living breathing human race aren't far off from our undead brethren in how we execute our daily routine. This makes for some of the most fabulous story telling in film, period.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead pays homage to all of George A. Romero's zombie films and even spoofs some of his most famous death scenes from his 1985 film Day of the Dead. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play off each other perfectly and the remaining supporting cast fit well and sell the story with ease.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest British comedies to come out in the last few years and will rank up there with such classics from guys like Monty Python and company. This film is a must have for any DVD collection."
"general-melchett","10","1","3","22 December 2006"," Funny, witty and enjoyable zombie comedy!
","Shaun of the Dead is probably one of the best zombie movies ever made. Dawn of the Dead was very gory but not at all funny, whereas Slither was just silly and not that funny - but Shaun of the Dead has everything. It is gory and very witty - a real cult classic. People will enjoy watching thick Ed, troubled Shaun and all the other characters in their crazy scenarios that take them across London. But Shaun of the Dead is also quite a realistic and troubling depiction of an apocalyptic world - made even more realistic by the fact that it builds up fear and chaos as it continues and starts on generally quite a small scale (chronicling the happenings at Shaun and Ed's house), rather than throwing us straight into the action right at the start like on Dawn of the Dead. The first 25 minutes are mainly concentrated on Shaun's social life - but hints are dropped on the zombie plague as the film continues, and despite the fact that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be Shaun of the Dead if it wasn't for the zombies, the film is really about Shaun's life and how quickly your life can change in one day. Instead of zombies getting blasted with shotguns and escaped from with cars, Shaun of the Dead follows the adventures of Shaun's ragtag group through the streets - in a way that probably would happen if something like this were ever to happen. Shaun and his friends didn't have guns or huge malls to defend them - they only had each other, their brains, and cunning plans. The bit where they all pretended to be zombies to get through a zombie crowd was genius and a plan that could be used in real life. Though the end is somewhat very action-packed, Shaun of the Dead is generally a very gritty and shocking film made on a small scale to capture the essence of real suburban life and the emotions and feelings of a couple of people trying to live through something they did not understand or could escape from. What I've been trying to say is - if a zombie plague were to happen in real life, Shaun of the Dead would be the closest thing to a proper survival guide you could get your hands on. I've spent most of my comment trying to be serious about this film when it is actually light-hearted, but I personally believe this is what every horror-comedy (or comedy in general) film should aspire to. With a packed-with-extras DVD release (complete with an interesting trivia track, commentaries, and tons more stuff), Shaun of the Dead is definitely one to get if you see it cheap. Spiffing! 10/10"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","1","3","31 July 2006"," ""You've got red on you""
","This is the best romantic comedy zombie film (""rom com zom"") you'll ever see, and possibly the ONLY you will see, so watch and enjoy Shaun of the Dead now before it becomes a cult classic. And trust me, it will. <br/><br/>Stuck with a dead-end job, having no motivation in life and living with a sluggish flatmate who only plays video games or drags him to the pub, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is your typical underachiever. In fact, his lazy attitude and inability to break this pattern drives his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) to break up with him, leaving him in an ever deeper rut than before. Shaun is so depressed with his situation that he does not even notice the ongoing zombie invasion that turns recently-diseased people into the living flesh-eating dead. It is not until the zombies literally show up at his doorstop and try to eat him and his flatmate alive that they pick up on that something is wrong. Priceless. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is the most random and simultaneously brilliant parody I have ever seen. Sure, there have been many well-crafted spoofs over the years (Young Frankenstein, Airplane! Army of Darkness, etc.) but where most films concentrate on parodying one genre, this film takes care of spoofing ALL genres--horror, comedy, romance and it does to in a genius way. For example, when Shaun and the rest seek refuge from the zombies at the local pub, barricading themselves in, it turns into a pastiche of From Dusk Till Dawn down to the very weapons they use, positions they stand in and the zombie attacks they suffer. Then you have the prototype of an anti-hero, Shaun, who turns into a Stallone-like tough guy during a short period of time in the pub, wearing a sweaty bandanna across his forehead and holding a rifle in his hand, generally looking like the most badass character in action films. <br/><br/>Just the way the dialogue cuts to an action deserves a great deal of credit as it is perfectly handled. Another thing, I often find myself getting annoyed at the reactions of the characters in horror films when they are faced with danger - they either don't look scared enough or they screw up their reaction in other ways - but in Shaun of the Dead, this is perfection. I don't expect I need to comment on the blatant allegory for the zombie generation of our time and the way people in big cities in London are not entirely different from zombies... a part of the reason why Shaun and his friends take time to realise something is wrong.<br/><br/>9/10"

But this film was brilliant. No two ways about it. The simple reason behind its success in knowledge. From the comedy stable of Pegg and Wright of S P A C E D fame, these two have always made it clear that they have a passion for classic Zombie films, so getting the chance to create their own must have seemed like music to their ears. The result is a classic - simple plot (in as far as the zombies and their disposal), but also a deep soup, into which the viewer can wade about in: the film plays like a Wheres Wally of extra stuff; some of which you don't realise until to hear the commentary! - It really is a top filum, and all because the writers had the knowledge and the passion for what they were making.

Boy, did it meet my expectations. This movie is the best Zombie movie in years, maybe even ever because it exploits the ridiculousness of the make up of the movies.<br/><br/>Cast of stock characters for Z movies. The main character: smart, leader, and always survives. Main Characters love interested: agreeable, attempts to rally the group to follow the MC. Idiot: disagrees, makes dumb decisions and always gets the group in trouble, always gets it in the end. All the characters are there but this movie adds one element to give a shock treatment to the world of Zombie movies ED. What a great character, (comic relief, although the movie is already hysterical) best friend of the main character and a complete new character for this type of movie. His completely lack of brain mass leads to the funniest scenes in the movie. A character that stays completely the same throughout the entire movie never wavering even with the entire city turned into the living dead.<br/><br/>This movie is littered with British comedy mixed with one liners that will make you laugh even after seeing the movie 100 times.<br/><br/>This movie came out right during the peek of horrible, new and remade, Zombie movies; 28 days, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead 2: Contagium, and some other dead movies that I have blocked out of my mind.

","Before ""Shaun of the Dead"", I had just about given up hope for the zombie-themed horror film. Apparently, just about every movie made today containing at least one shambling undead creature must be either tedious or so gruesomely violent as to make professional serial killers lose their lunch. ""Shaun"" changed my mind in a hurry.<br/><br/>The movie itself is about two losers, Shaun and Ed, who must fight against hordes of living corpses in order to save Shaun's (ex)girlfriend, his mum, and the pub that forms the center of their lives. Just about everything about this variant of the normal zombie horror flick blew my mind. For example: <br/><br/>1. Instead of taking place somewhere in the US, the audience sees their heroes running around London for a decent change. <br/><br/>2. Very little gore and gun-play; just some blood spurting around and multiple blunt objects being used to their full potential. <br/><br/>3. No more heroic stars, no brave cops or security guards to force their way through the zombie hordes. Here, the action is focused around a white collar bum and his lazy stoner friend. <br/><br/>This stand against the zombie norm is one of the reasons why I enjoy this film so much; the other major reason being it's just freakin' funny.<br/><br/>If you love comedies and you're tired of the same old zombies ripping the same old heads off the same old movie stereotypes, go for ""Shaun of the Dead"".

Stuck in a dead end job and in a constant fight with his step father, Shaun can only rely on his good old friend Ed (Nick Frost) and the old pub they frequent, the Winchester. When zombies appear and begin to wreak havoc, Shaun decides this may be the chance to prove Liz that he can be a man and goes on a quest to rescue her, and take her to the Winchester.<br/><br/>That's basically the plot of Edgar Wright's brilliant romantic-zombie comedy, ""Shaun of the Dead"". Straight from the great sitcom ""Spaced"", Wright & Pegg have written what could be, the best comedy of the year, and one of the funniest movies of all time. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is basically a romantic comedy happening in the middle of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", with all the clichÃ©s of both genres, but included in very intelligent and funny ways.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg shines in his character as Shaun, with a performance so good that makes the character truly believable as a loser who must grow and get things done. Nick Frost as Ed is the perfect companion to Pegg, and their chemistry is quite great. Shaun and Ed probably will go down in history as one of the best comedy team in movies.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are awesome too and nobody gives a bad performance. Brilliant is the work of Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran as Liz' best friends, and while Kate Ashfield is probably the weakest link, her performance is still up to the challenge.<br/><br/>The make-up and SFX, essential in a zombie movie, are top-notch and the care taken by director Wright show his truly respect for the genre he is making fun of in his movie. The film delivers its good share of gore and blood and is also filled with references to classic movies of the genre. Horror fans will be pleased with ""Shaun of the Dead"".<br/><br/>Overall, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is now a modern classic, joining classics such as ""Brainead"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" as films that set the standards for comedy/horror. 9/10. Classic"

","I am not a fan of zombie movies to Say the least therefore I was pleasantly surprised and somewhat thrilled when I saw this for the first time.<br/><br/>What can I say but what a show, I laughed from start to finish. Simon Pegg is a very talented writer and comic actor. He is in my opinion the British Woody Allen. I was not familiar with him and Edgar Wrights previous working relationship but this is a classic example of a actor and director being on the same wavelenght and working not for the money but for their sheer love of film making.<br/><br/>Pegg plays Shaun whose live is bookended by his best mate Ed (Nick Frost) and his local pub The Winchester. He is dumped by his girl friend on the eve of an Apocalypse. He decides overnight that his girlfriend is the girl from him and he must get his life back on tracks. With the aid of Ed he must rescue his girlfriend, her friends and his mother from certain extinction. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is well acted, written and directed. It's supporting cast is fantastic. Nick Frost is brilliant as Ed but in my own opinion it's the performance by Dylan Moran that really shine through as the cowardly David. Kate AShfield plays Peggs girlfriend although she comes across as quite annoying I will admit this girl has talent. The Cast also boasts the best in British Comedy ranging from Matt Lucas, Reece Shearsmith, Tamzin Grieg and many others.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead has got something for every one and it will not disappoint Horror fans. Already a cult success partnership I look forward to Peggs & Wrights further collaborations. Especially if they are as clever and funny as this."

","Shaun of the dead is a must see film, it's hilarious, Shaun and Ed (his fat friend) are very well played, the story/adventure is brilliant and it is never boring.

Eventually I hired Shaun of the dead from the video store not expecting a hell of a lot but I was dead wrong. It began hilarious and didn't stop, it was very violent and very entertaining. The characters were very cool and it seemed as their adventure would never end<br/><br/>What the audience enjoys is when it seems that there is noway out of the disaster that has occurred there is happy ending with blood splattering every where. <br/><br/>I conclusion, Sean of the dead is a must see movie that is never, ever boring throughout the whole movie."

This movie will also get you into every Zombie movie ever created, and I will admit when I first saw the trailer for Shaun Of The Dead, I thought that it was going to just another typical B rated movie, but when I finally got around to watching the movie I realized I couldn't have been more wrong. Its a movie that its just straight perfect. It's a ""MUST"" in any persons DVD collection, and you will watch it over and over because this is just one of those movies that never get tiring to see.

","OK, this movie had in my country one of the worst promotions I have ever seen. Even they changed the great title from ""Shaun of the dead"" to ""Zombie's party"". Impossible to explain, this shows that great horror movies like this one have a bad promotion because of the thematic. Looks like the premise of ROM-ZOM-COM wasn't interesting enough for my country, but sadly I can't change that.<br/><br/>About the movie, I have to say that I have never laugh so much with a horror movie like with this one. The duo of Edward Wright and Simon Pegg is genius, their screenplay has nothing to envy the ones written by George Romero, and the powerful comedy is not an excuse to show us really gruesome zombie gore moments.<br/><br/>There is no political background here, here is social background. A guy passing through the crisis of his upcoming 30's, he has to move on to survive. So he has to keep living without friends, without his mom, without his step-dad (Bill Nighy, such a joy), and to fix things with his girlfriend.<br/><br/>As the tag line says, this is a romantic comedy with zombies, and you can't dig much more in that basic plot, which makes it delightfully simple."

","I have seen this film several times now and I it's hard to get sick of it. It is witty, funny and not at all corny or ridiculous. It's sharp when it should be sharp, it's sad when it's supposed to be sad but it's still funny where it counts. It's just brilliant directing and acting. I love it. My friend even was so kind as to introduce me to the TV series SPACED by the same team and director which is just as good. I recommend this to everyone - except those who hate gore - it's funny but there is a bit of that in it. It doesn't lag at all! The whole way through you are being entertained by something else! One of the best things about this film though - is that it works on so many levels. Every time you watch it you pick more up. There are little clues and cool references to Zombie movies and other films. It's worth the watch!<br/><br/>Watch it if you Love IDLE HANDS."

It manages to do everything from making you laugh to making you jump, to making you think *Aaaw*(But thankfully not too much). During the first viewing, I was taken by it's ""Britishness"". Itwasn't very often that a movie's main action can take place in a pub! It was only during the second viewing that I saw that the script was actually very well thought out and clever. What impressed me was the fact that the zombies look incredibly convincing and the action scenes are genuinely exciting, which is made even more impressive by the film's budget. I would recommend this film to anyone, regardless of personal tastes. There's something for everyone, be it comedy, action, even a few snatches of romance! i think it's brilliant, and I'm proud to have it in my collection."

","First came Abbot and Costello Meet...<br/><br/>Then came Young Frankenstein...<br/><br/>Then American Werewolf in London...<br/><br/>Return of the Living Dead... and now...Shaun!<br/><br/>The history of horror comedy if filled with gems and this takes the cake. Not only is it consistently funny, gory and filled with Romeroesque social satire, it far out does any of the mass market slapstick Will Ferrell/Jack Black comedy and the endless output of predictable copycat horror that American studios keep shoving down the public's throat. Shaun of the Dead digs at everything from the zombie genre to the zombie-like existence of the general shuffling public. Shaun may be a loser in some sense, but when you really look at the film, most men will find that at some point in their lives the could be the character. In fact, Shaun is the epitome of the twentysomething, working class male of the 21 century. Come on, how many of us would not like to be ably to hang at the pub, down pints with our long time pals and play video games all day. Don't forget the hot girlfriend and the drama that comes with that. Throw in the opportunity to bash the skulls of some zombies and play the hero of the day and you've got the perfect existence, right?<br/><br/>That's basically what you get when Shaun rises from his couch to take on life. Shaun and the assembly line existence of the service industry level emplotment that forms the majority of the working class are already zombies, they just don't see it as illustrated by Shaun's daily routine at the beginning of the film. What differentiates Shaun from the rest is the dormant motivation he possesses to change that which consumes the rest.The zombies are a great allegory for the challenges of growing up, maturing and the demons we all must overcome in order to salvage our lives from the mundane. You either sit back, make no moves and become a zombie or you fight back and make the changes in order to succeed and rise to the top of the pack. Shaun's struggles are no different than our own and it is fun to watch from the safety of the theatre or your own couch with the DVD playing in your PlayStation as the zombies attack. <br/><br/>What makes this clever RomZomCom different from the films in the comedy and horror genres of recent years is that the setting is not a fantastic world or an upperclass suburban white neighborhood filled with movie star beauty. It is a real place that exists in every city, populated with realistic people making it easy for the average person to relate to. The humor is sharp and intelligent instead of being in you face vulgar and mindless. There is not attempt to capitalize on the trends of mainstream comedy to rake in the bucks. The horror is not reliant on expensive yet obvious CGI effects or recycled masked killers that are as outdated as 80's style high bangs and leg warmers. This movie goes straight to the gut, whether for laughs or repulsion. It is worthy of the films it parodies and makes fun of. You will have fun picking out the minor characters from the beginning of the film after they have become zombies. Notice that other than the craving for human flesh the undead versions of the individuals is not much different than their pre-zombie lives. Shaun of the Dead is a gem that will hopefully make American studios take notice of and explore."
"cotter414","10","1","3","4 January 2006"," A film that defies genres and exemplifies comic genius.
","After stumbling upon this film on HBO one night at home, I have become an instant Simon Pegg fanatic. His and Edgard Wright's brilliantly creative and comedic styles really stand out in every aspect of 'Shaun of the Dead'. It's very rare for me to discuss this picture without gushing about its genius. This is a film that can be watched over and over again, and each time you'll notice a new, subtle, yet stunningly clever detail that you missed the last time. The swift pace is consistent throughout the entire film and there's never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The delightfully engaging cast of characters is brilliantly portrayed by an assemblage of marvelously talented young actors, along with veterans Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton (who plays Shaun's adorable mum, Barbara).<br/><br/>One of my favorite characteristics of the film is the parallelism between the first segment of the film leading up to the zombie invasion, and the second segment during the crisis itself. It's difficult to explain without revealing too much about the film, so watch it first and see if you can point it out on your own. The idiosyncrasy that sets this apart from any other picture I've seen is that while the comedy aspect of it really is hysterical, the zombies themselves stay true to the horror genre.<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is destined to become a cult hit and I look forward to enjoying future works from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright."
"gmcvay@patriot.net","Null","1","3","28 December 2005"," I shouldn't have liked this...
","SPOILERS! BIG ONES! <br/><br/>I was definitely not the target audience for this movie in any way. I'm not from England; I'm not a man, and particularly not one with girlfriend problems; and I don't like horror movies generally, so all of the little homages to those sailed right over my head like a Dire Straits album flung by a desperate slacker. Not only that, since the US only gets Britcoms in small doses, I had no idea who Simon Pegg was; the only cast members I'd heard of were Bill Nighy of ""Kiss Me Kate,"" and Peter Serafinowicz, whom I knew only as the (sexy) voice of (mega-sexy) Darth Maul.<br/><br/>So I shouldn't have liked this movie at all. But I really did. Bill Nighy's turn as the stepfather who ironically becomes most human just as he's about to turn into a zombie is magnificent, as is the much-discussed bit where Debbie instructs the little group in how to act like zombies to escape detection -- a moment that reminded me pleasantly of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and her ""Scooby Gang."" Much has been said about the film's social commentary, which includes the annoying -- and, at the door of the Winchester, potentially lethal -- ubiquity of cell phones. But beyond that, the movie works by not taking itself too seriously, yet at the same time showing real heart -- mostly in brief flashes, like the deaths of Philip and Barbara, but most so at the end: it takes a truly devoted friend to keep his zombified, ""bitey"" best mate tied up with a PlayStation in his shed (which Liz apparently doesn't mind, even though she couldn't stand Ed as a human).<br/><br/>Yes, it drags in places; David's crush on Liz is so obvious that it really doesn't need explication at such length in the pub, for example. And our hero and heroine are saved not by their own actions, but by a massive deus ex machina. But the movie's humor of the ordinary (Barbara, seeing Shaun's cricket bat: ""Is that for the jumble?"") makes a lovely background for the surreal events that unfold.<br/><br/>Thanks to seeing this movie randomly on cable, I'll now be looking up ""Spaced,"" probably ""Black Book,"" and other series that contributed cast members. Will I seek out the original Romero movies, or other horror movies given nods here? Probably not. David's death was much more gory -- and drawn out -- than even his whiny character deserved, and was about as much gore as I really needed to see. But I enjoyed ""Shaun of the Dead,"" even when I clearly shouldn't have, and I'm glad to have stumbled, zombie-fashion, across it."

","Shaun of the Dead (2004) 3 and 1/4 stars (A)(reviews out of 4) British comedy about a guy with problems with his girlfriend, lives with his lazy, sloppy friend, who his roommate keeps trying to kick out, plus (and it seems to be the least of his problems until about halfway) there's a zombie epidemic. It's so funny to watch this movie and see the irony of all the lines before the zombies really start to be a problem (Next time I see him, he's dead; or what I will say is this: it's not the end of the world) and also, the fact that everything, and I mean everything in the movie repeats itself (at the start, Shaun is watching Ed play 1st person shooter on PS2 and says top left, reload, nice shot, and then in middle in Winchester, Shaun is shooting a rifle, Ed says top left, reload, nice shot), (Shaun is talking to Liz about their r relationship and she says ""if I don't do something..."", Shaun says what do you mean do something?, then in front of Winchester with zombies all around, Shaun says if I don't do something..., Liz says what do you mean do something?), (Would you like To A Wonderful Mum or Pow! Supermum Uh the first one, You want the girl or the bloat Uh the first one). It's just really cool to see all that, and each time you watch it you notice something more. Also, it has plenty of references to Romero movies (we're coming to get you, Barbera) along with all the jokes and funny situations. And adding some intense violence couldn't hurt either. It's just a great movie all around and I would recommend it to anyone who pays really close attention to the dialog and the radios in the background or TV's because that's where most of the jokes are and otherwise you won't find it very funny. Best part: The part when Shaun tries to take a shortcut over the 20 garden fences."

","Shaun of the Dead was, in mostly every way, perfect. It was hilarious, it was creepy, at times frightening, and the jokes never got old. Shaun, (Simon Pegg), is a 29-year-old electronic store manager who must deal most nights with a problem: spending a good night with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) without having his best friend and flatmate (Nick Frost, in an awesome role) there all the time. The result is they are always having a night at the local pub, the Winchester. Ed loves it there, Liz hates it, and Shaun is stuck in the middle. This sets up a roller coaster ride of insanely funny accurances as well as some minor, scary jump scenes. The performances in general are good (especially Pegg who is always on the spot with his great comedic abilities), the writing is well crafted, and the director is well done. Yeah Boyy! 10/10"

From the beginning, portraying goofy Shaun and lazy Ed to the unexpected end, you laugh yourself to death. The anti-hero characteristics of Shaun and Ed give the movie an unique but brilliant touch. Adding things from well known movies gives movie experts moments of silent joy(for example the red handkerchief worn by Shaun around the head in the Pub after he is hit by a dart was worn by Christopher Walken in the Russian roulette scenes in ¨The Deer Hunter¨). Despite having the characteristics of an indie movie, Shaun of the Dead has surprisingly good special effects and is cinematographically top. A great movie."

","Shaun of the Dead is a unique zombie movie. It's unique because it's also romantic. It's unique because it mixes British humor with American Horror. It's unique because it's a romantic comedy...with zombies.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead tells a story about two slackers, Ed and Shaun. Shaun is a %50 loser, %50 nice guy. He loves his work as a manager of an electronics store, he loves playing Timesplitters: Future Perfect with his buddy, Ed and also loves hanging out at the Winchester with him. But he gets overstressed by his flatmate Pete, his girlfriend Liz, and also Liz's friend, David. He is also sad because he was chosen with two options: His girlfriend or the pub he hangs out with.<br/><br/>Ed, on the other hand, is a pure loser. He is fat, he has no job and he kept playing Timesplitters: Future Perfect for 6 hours a day. He makes Shaun looks stupid, but Shaun didn't realized this till the middle of the movie. He has a good social intelligence, due to the fact that he knows most people hanging out at the pub (Snakehips the womanizer, the ex-porn star and John the barman). He is easily hated by his 2nd flatmate, Pete.<br/><br/>Shaun has a girlfriend named Liz. She's a primary school teacher and both of them met in Greece. She lives with David, a lecturer and Diana, a drama school teacher. She gets tired of Shaun hanging out with Ed, so she wants Shaun to go somewhere interesting than the Winchester, so Shaun promised. But, like other promises, this one's a failed promise.So she dumped Shaun, causing Shaun to hang out with Ed at the Winchester, again.<br/><br/>The next day, zombies attacked London. Shaun doesn't realized until a zombie girl appeared in the garden. Worrying that his other loved ones may suffer the same thing, Shaun and Ed came to rescue Liz, Shaun mother Barbara, Diana and David, who thinks that he is more smarter than Shaun and the rest of the crew. And so, they headed for somewhere safe, somewhere Ed says: ""Know where the exits are, somewhere familiar, and he can smoke"", and the only place to have it all is: The WInchester.<br/><br/>Now, let's get on to the other characters. Diana is a good friend of Liz who is also supportive of Shaun even when she supports David more. David, on the other hand is not supportive of Shaun in all sorts and thinks that he is smarter than Shaun, and this has a very open debate between the book smarts(David) and the street smarts(Shaun). Peter is Shaun's flatmate. He hates Ed and keeps accusing Shaun of defending Ed. He ends up becoming a naked bathtub zombie. Philip is Shaun's grumpy step dad and has always been unkind to Shaun with his Gothic accent and his suspicious behavior. Barbara is Shaun's sweet mum and despite of Shaun's hatred towards Philip, Barbara still loves Philip, even when becoming a zombie.<br/><br/>What differs this movie from other zombie films that it is not about the zombies nor the amount of violence unlike Romero's Living Dead and Raimi's Evil Dead series, but it's more about survival and background. It's tells you more about what are you going to do when something like this happens. The background is also important. Just like Ju-On, the surrounding of the whole area is what's more important. When Shaun was drinking tea with his mum, you can hear the car Ed was driving crashing to the post and when Shaun and Ed were drinking at the Winchester the day Shaun broke up with Liz, you can see the zombie walking to the bar door. It's all that matters, you can even see more of it if you watch it.<br/><br/>The whole script was good. It has a good humor and the best ever and also has some reference from zombie films to several 80's hip-hop music. SImon Pegg delivers the best in zombie comedy since Peter Jackson's Braindead, and Edgar Wright's direction gave us the best in high-quality film-making. If you're a fan of horror who hate romance, then this movie's for you. If you're a fan of romance who hates horror, then this movie's for you too. If you're a fan of both, then of course this movie's for you. What else i'm gonna say? Rating: 10/10"

","Shaun of the Dead is a truly unique film in the aspect that is seamlessly combines zombie horror with a romantic comedy. What I expected was a funny, but shallow zombie/comedy flick, but underneath the blood and humor, it really is a heartfelt movie.<br/><br/>The movie begins like you would expect it to. It was hilarious, with lots of subtle hints of what would happen later. The actors are all fantastic and each one of them is hilarious in their own way. The script is sharp and witty (although a lot of that British humor might have gone way over my head) and the direction was spot-on. What I didn't expect, though, came toward the end. Near the conclusion, the film actually gets pretty heavy. From such themes as keeping those you love alive, but keeping everyone safe and being in complete desperation make this a surprisingly intense movie. I also really really liked the use of Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"" and the references to ""Night of the Living Dead"". It's also fun to look out for zombified people who were normal in the beginning.<br/><br/>Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a great horror/comedy film that is a total blast.

","Hands down this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. From the part where Shaun and Ed throw records at the zombies in the back yard to the part where Shaun and Ed plan out their mother's rescue (and step father's demise) this movie is sheer brilliance. The movie starts off where Shaun and Liz are discussing each other's friends and how they just don't like them. A day or so later, on their anniversary, Shaun and Liz break up. Another day later and the town is infested with zombies. Shaun overall is just having a bad day and in addition to that is oblivious to the fact that the town is infested with zombies. As the movie goes on we can't help but realize how a craving for beer and love can over take the fact that there's a group of zombies outside waiting to eat Shaun and Ed. I'd overall recommend this to British humor fans, zombie fans, horror/comedy fans, or people who are just in the mood for a good romantic comedy with zombies. This is a must see."

","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a decent movie with some comedy and horror elements, but personally I feel that this film is pretty over-rated.

Ed is his slovenly ""partner-in-crime"", and when the town becomes over-run by zombies, Shaun scoops up his girlfriend Liz, and they all head to the bar (!) to ""hole-up"" and defend themselves.<br/><br/>Definitely some good humorous scenes, but very lacking in the gore department. After all the hype this film received I have to honestly say I was kinda disappointed. A pretty fun and funny horror/comedy, but I'll stick with Peter Jackson's far superior BRAINDEAD. Anyone who has seen SHAUN but not BRAINDEAD should definitely check the latter out. Far more hilarious and tons more gore. A generous 7/10 for SHAUN"

","When I saw this movie advertised,I knew it would be good, as Simon Pegg hardly ever goes wrong. Fortunatly I was *Dead* right. Pegg has created a Spaced-esqe zombie flick dripping with references to other parts from other films. Don't think this is unoriginal though, this has to be one of the funniest zombie films around for a good while. Whilst the plot has the backbone of all the rest of the zombie films(Lead is unexpectedly made hero as zombies flood the city.)it's knowing references and jokes at the genre(Simon Peggs' character is unwilling to say the word zombie,GAR fans)make sure the viewer laughs the whole way through and at the end will want to watch it again.

","This is a zombie genre tribute that manages to balance satire and some scary (not those many actually) moments. The horror-comedy follows from beginning to end the title character through his anonymous life in London and could be either a romantic story or a horror flick disguised as something making laugh. Edgar Wright all the sad and frequent compromises adults must cope with, symbolizing them by blending a killer soundtrack, suspense and the classical zombie clichés. Plus, he gives a look at British life, telling how monotonous life may be sometimes. We are many times surrounded by zombies without even realizing it."

","This is a pretty good film for a lighthearted romp with splattering brains. Really...probably the best mix of comedy and gore out there. There's enough character development to get behind the trials and travails of Shaun and his gang. The script and direction are good and Shaun's buddy Ed is a cut up ( and does some cutting up)! Shaun's gal has a great butt! The British twist on the humor and embedded commentary on society give the film more punch. We Americans are finally are shown the proper use of a cricket bat.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing for me is how far reaching Romero's little B&W zombie film has become."

","This film is brilliant! sorry but it is. I went round a mates to see it an i just wanted to watch it again and again. That was about 10 months ago an i've got it on DVD and i must watch it a lot. Why? This film is really clever, it somehow manages to mix romance and horror an sadness an happiness and.....zombies together in one 2 hour session of fun. Its clever because all the tag lines are impeccably timed throughout the film, Ed gets the best lines not just because they're really funny anyway but because of when he says them. E.g in the pub, "" could get a round "" when they are really scared. I think the character of Shaun is really well done and Simon Pegg pulls of a performance which is what a lot of nearly 30's are in. Girlfriend in a mood, losing money, bad job. His character is believable because lots of us know people in the same situation as him.<br/><br/>The camera work in this is good as well quick shots an panning round rooms and ""look behind you!"" shots are all good and can make you jump sometimes to.<br/><br/>The actors are all great in this. the person who cast them in this film should be knighted or something My verdict- fried gold!"
"cherold","7","1","3","30 July 2005"," brilliant comedy, but a bit too zombieish for me
","Shaun of the Dead is an interesting creature. A movie as clever as it's title, the best part of this stylishly filmed movie is it's sly first half hour, in which the film makers taunt the audience with a series of goofy take-offs on standard zombie film making. The movie takes its time to get to the Zombies, starting by involving you in the lives of the characters, but while this was the flaw in The Birds and Jurasic Park, it works great here because the non-zombie scenes are lots of fun.<br/><br/>The movie slides from relationship/buddy comedy to horror movie as it goes along. It's a nicely done slide that takes you deeper into the more suspenseful part of the movie without being jarring and it never loses its sense of humor, but one scene was way too gory for me (if one scene were toned down I would probably give this an 8) and the attempts at drama tended to be flat. But while I wouldn't call it a perfect movie, it was a movie of perfect moments, and well worth watching if you can deal with a little gore (very little by the standards of the Zombie genre, but a fair amount by the standards of the buddy picture.)"

","When I first saw 'Shaun of the Dead,' I wasn't sure what I was watching. It was recommended to me by a professor who specifically wanted me to watch it because she knew that I'd like it for the British humor, and she wanted someone to talk to about it.<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is a film that can be viewed in many different ways. It can be viewed as a British screwball romantic comedy with zombies, or it can be viewed as a zombie movie style parody with in-jokes and references for zombie fans. It can also be viewed as a clear cut zombie movie with jokes. Sharp writing with clever dialogue make 'Shaun of the Dead' the Austin Powers of zombie movies. I bought it on DVD with the 2004 version of 'Dawn of the Dead' and I've seen 'Shaun of the Dead three or four times already, and 'Dawn of the Dead' lays on my couch gathering dust. Very Funny, witty, cleverly satiric with Gen-X references, eery and romantic all come to mind when describing 'Shaun of the Dead.'"

","Shaun of the dead is my favourite film. It has a variety of different tastes of drama, the way that it has a romantic side as Shaun tries to win Liz back. It also has a scary side when the zombies attack the living and try to eat them. Although these parts are a little bit gruesome, they are still amazingly funny to watch. As the film progresses Shaun knows that he has to win Liz's heart. He risks his life to try and save her, plus moaning David and happy Dianne. This film has a degree of sadness too, like when Shaun's mother is bitten and dies, or when David is maliciously eaten by a group of zombies. I would recommend this film to anyone that would wish to watch it, as it certainly lives up to it's name as a rom zom com."

","The tag line of this movie can't be truer enough. This one treads different grounds, and comes out being a blast to watch. Shaun is 40 percent comedy, 30 percent romance, and 30 percent horror. It is a gradient combination, where the first half featured light situations showing how Shaun copes up with his relationships, then the suspense is eased little by little. By the middle of it the comedy is of equal relevance to the zombie epidemic, creating humorous events that have never been thought of before. Towards the end, the tensions fill. There are liberal amounts of gore in the Winchester pub climax, one that might come unexpectedly, given that the film's first hour or so was fun-filled, though occasionally there are trickles of jokes that drop in.<br/><br/>Its premise might come off as strange, but the formula works.

","If you understand that description, you'll understand just what makes this film so funny. I refer, of course, to the British TV series, not the watered down, unfunny American version that was aimed at Budweiser toting Jocks whose idea of a good read is the Enquirer or the Globe.<br/><br/>Essentially this is British humour at its best, and either you like it or you don't. It's crude, thin on plot, but hugely funny on comedic timing and farcical situations.<br/><br/>Reading the message boards, I see so many morons ranting about how the special effects were rubbish, or the film was boring, and they are the people that are really not going to get 99% of the humour in this film. They are the people that say ""Eight Legged Freaks"" was fantastic cinema.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead is right there with Monty Python, Benny Hill, Ab Fab, Fawlty Towers, and heaven knows what that American TV has done its best to reproduce and consistently failed to do so in usually catastrophic fashion, albeit varyingly commercially successful on the networks.<br/><br/>American humour couldn't invent any of these programs, they always have to copy them; even The Office is going to get a workover for heaven's sake! It's like copying the Mona Lisa. It will always be second best.<br/><br/>It says it all when Friends is probably the most successful US comedy series in England (probably the world); American writers and actors can find the global funny bone, but that's ticklish laughter, not the roll over, tears in your eyes, stomach hurting laughter that's in this film.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of British humour you will laugh at this film like it's going out of fashion and you tear muscles.<br/><br/>If you are not, I'm afraid most of it will go over your head, but it's certainly worth a rental for trying.<br/><br/>I would say Pegg had his finger on the pulse of what direction Dawn of the Dead was going to take, because there certainly seem to be some broad similarities between the two.<br/><br/>Personally I know I'll be watching this film again and again with people who haven't seen it, if only for them to be so grateful as to buy me a pint.<br/><br/>Geddit?!<br/><br/>Cheers, Harry"
"sallie-pritchard","10","1","3","26 October 2004"," Finally, some romance in the movies! Who wouldn't want Simon Pegg to fight zombies for you?
","My favourite horror sub-genre is without a doubt the zombie flick. There's something much more creepy about a horde of rotting corpses feeding on people than any mother-obsessed stalker of scantily-clad teenaged girls, or creepy Japanese girls stalking single working mothers (don't get me started on that!). There's usually a formula to most American (and British) zombie movies:<br/><br/>1- group of survivors hole up in a refuge. 2- the government or government agency is responsible for the zombies. 3- said government, particularly the military, cleans up its own mess to save the day. 4- the zombies are slow for a reason- so that while they slowly swarm the 'refuge', internal tensions amongst the survivors escalate to the point that escape seems impossible. 5- the zombies are easy to handle until loved ones join the undead. 6- set the comedy dial to black. 7- and this is most important from an academic perspective- that the zombies are merely an extreme incarnation of the society we live in.<br/><br/>Recent zombie films have tried some interesting variations on this formula, but they just don't satisfy. The key is to follow that formula to the letter, and have fun with it. Which brings me to Shaun of the Dead. This film is brought to us by two-thirds of the team behind British comedy series Spaced, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Fellow Spaced team members, Jessica Stevenson (as seemingly female version of Shaun), and Nick Frost (as Ed, Shaun's best friend) also star in the film. Shaun of the Dead does all of the above and more. Finally, some romance in the movies! I personally would love Simon Pegg to fight the undead for me. Highlights include Shaun's walk to the shops after a big night out (in which he pays more attention to whether he's buying coke or diet coke than the bloody handprints on the fridge door), great use of a Queen track (yep, its better than Bohemian Rhapsody in Wayne's World- thats a big call, but I'm not afraid to make it), and of course, the record hurling approach to fighting the undead. It may come as a surprise that this film is distributed by a subsidiary of Working Title Films- whose romantic comedies, with the possible exception of Bridget Jones's Diary, appear obsessed with selling Britain back to itself. That aside, Shaun of the Dead is more successful than fellow Working Title production Wimbledon, which attempts to blend the romantic comedy with the sports movie, because it successfully blends the conventions of the romantic comedy with the zombie formula. Its what we've always wanted, isn't it folks?"
"Ace-38","Null","1","3","26 October 2004"," Hollywood, pay attention to this film!!!!
","Because THIS is how it's done. As the world's first ever romantic comedy with zombies, 'Shaun' excels in every facet of its story. Want a decent enough romantic comedy, it's here (although the comedy outweighs the romance). Want graphic moments of zombie carnage? They're here. <br/><br/>Plot line is simple enough, a down on his luck electronics salesman loses his girlfriend after blowing an important date, and after hearing the occasional snippet of news about a returning satellite, wakes up the next day to a zombie nightmare. He then snaps into action, going to rescue his mother (Barbara, played by Penelope Wilton) and Liz and takes them to the local pub. Coming along for the ride are Shaun's college roommate Ed (Nick Frost), who hasn't quite gotten out of the slacker mode, and Liz's roommates David and Dianne (Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis). <br/><br/>Great British humor lines practically every frame of the film, the romantic aspect is there, but never tries to overwhelm the film, and when the film kicks in with the zombie aspect in the last third, it packs quite a horror wallop. <br/><br/>Everything balances perfectly in the mix, and while the comedy does tend to be very prevalent, the references to its zombie (but don't say that word, Shaun doesn't like it) past is obvious. Many situations are closer to Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' than the obvious 'Dawn of the Dead' reference in the title would have you think.<br/><br/>Acting is top notch from Simon Pegg on down to the zombie extras. Nothings forced, nothing comes off as silly or corny, this is a perfectly crafted film. <br/><br/>Best of all, this isn't even one of those homage type films where you have to look to catch the references, they just pop out at you in a groanless glory. <br/><br/>Best film of the year, hands down. <br/><br/>5 out of 5"
"theoscillator_13","Null","1","3","2 October 2004"," absolutely brilliant
","I'm not particularly a fan of British humor but I am a fan of zombie movies and I thought this one was a unique and entertaining example of the genre. On the surface this is a funny movie that plays on all the conventions of the zombie genre. There are lots of inside jokes and references to other zombie movies from Night of the Living dead up to 28 Days Later (with a news caster commenting about ""Rage infected monkeys""). On a slightly deeper level there is a lot of social commentary about how the citizens of the modern, industrialized world are increasingly difficult to tell apart from zombies. But even the social commentary in the movie comes across as very self conscious because it is commenting on the same themes that Romero did 20 years ago. On a technical note, I think the lighting was very effective for a lower budget movie and the editing was exceptional (especially the intro sequence with the seamless wipes across the screen from one shot to the next while Shaun goes about his morning routine). Overall I would say that any fan of zombie movies will really enjoy Shaun of the Dead but it's also entertaining enough that it will appeal to people who aren't fans of horror, zombies or British humor."

","As a zombie fan I've to say I'm currently over the moon at the upsurge in zombie movies at the moment.  From what I can gather I've Mr Danny Boyle and the great 28 Days Later to thank for that.  It seems this has allowed films with the dreaded ""Z"" word to be bankrolled once again allowing for more undead shenanigans since the late 70s.<br/><br/>Even with all this in mind its amazing that a film like this was made. This is a romantic situation comedy where the situation is zombies attack!<br/><br/>I would have imagined that this would have been stamped too gory for fans of romantic comedy and too soppy for horror enthusiasts leaving it in limbo. However due to the success of ""Spaced"" this was thankfully given a green light and it works.. and its because of a great cast, script and execution.<br/><br/>Of special mention is The first 30 minutes of this film. Similar to the first few minutes of the latest Dawn of the Dead but vastly extended. We catch glimpses at every turn of the upcoming zombie menace as we follow Shaun through his day.  Its funny in a nervous laughter way.  One second we see army trucks that are being sent into contain a ""problem in south east england"" on the news only to see them pass by Shaun moments later. This may not sit well with more impatient audiences but it allows for some (shock!) character development and sets the scene wonderfully.  The more attention paid the more you'll get out of it.  A sequence when shaun flicks through tv stations and effectively misses all the news reports is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>The real strength though comes from the fact that this is  a refreshing change from the ""survival horror computer gameesque"" zombie films of late. It addresses how people would deal with zombies in a much more realistic way than the average zombie flick.  Certainly from the perspective of a resident of a country which doesnt have a ""right to bear arms"" anyway! Even with access to guns the never ending ammo, perfect shot world often portrayed in American zombie films is unrealistic. This film has one gun and thats used atrociously / hilariously (eg. a one liner falling flat on its face because of not cocking a shotgun!).<br/><br/>Characters make do with what they have.  They plan poorly and get themselves in bad situations for real reasons.  Because they are stressed ...not because of an attachment to a pet.  The only exception to this is where the comedy is allowed to overplay the reality of the situation.  For example one scene has Shaun and his flatmate fight off the zombies with vinyl records.  Its a bit detracting but also funny enough to justify its inclusion in the film.<br/><br/>Comedy elements extend to references to other genre films, especially romeros dead trilogy (""we're coming to get you Barbra!).  These are probably included to keep the attention of the zombie nerds who may get bored when there hasn't been a decapitation in three minutes.  However this approach is not perfect.  There are times when theres probably too much zombies in a row then too much romantic comedy.  So if you are there for one or the other you will think the film is dragging.  Those who can appreciate both will be more than happy though and the moments when they intermingle perfectly are gold.<br/><br/>All in all if the current Zombie film craze wants to last any longer its going to need films like Shaun of the Dead to run with new and interesting ways of using what is in all fairness an already tired and well explored genre."

His housemate is a loveably offensive drug dealer who spends all day lounging around the house playing computer games, while Shaun's entire social life seems to consist of going to the pub. When zombies appear in London, Shaun rises to the occasion and leads his band of friends and relatives in a full on battle again the living dead. Familiar faces from Spaced, the excellent Nick Frost, Peter Serafinowicz, Julia Deakin (in a brief cameo) and some from Black Books (also a Nira Park production) Dylan Moran and Tamsin Greig, make this a delight while Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman from the office also appear. Bill Nighy has a short but memorable appearance as Pegg's screen stepfather Phillip and while the first half of the film is hilarious, the second half turns into a genuine horror film as Shaun and friends tackle an army of excellent zombies. An instant cult classic which some will find disturbing. However, despite the modest budget, Wright and Pegg have done a fantastic job of delivering one of the best films of the year, and indeed the decade.

Shaun (Pegg) is just an ordinary bloke living with his mate Ed (Danger! 50,000 Volts! star Nick Frost) and also Pete (Comic Relief 2003's Terry Wogan, Peter Serafinowicz). He seems to have a normal life, but the next day (although he doesn't notice at first) the recently dead are coming back to life and eating people. He, Ed and his Mum, David (Dylan Moran) and Liz (Kate Ashfield) are on the run trying to hide from these creatures.

It was nominated the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the BAFTA Interactive Award DVD and the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for Nira Park (producer), and it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film. It was number 3 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"

","I am sorry fans but i have to be frank, I totally hated that movie. Why? because it's an insult to Romero, Fulci etc! everything is bad, cheap and how my god British humor is awful. I could't laugh during all the movie! OK, the idea was good, OK the principal character is huh...appealing (kind of puppy) but Oh my God... this movie is maybe the worst ever, even Leprechaun is better...! The actors are not funny except the fat guy, the story is crappy and cheap and...huh just see the movie, you'll see! don't go to cinema! too expensive for that kind of ****. I'd rather liked ""House of ""Waste"", no great story, no great actors but..Elisha Cuthbert is delicious."
"kapilrautela","4","1","4","10 February 2019"," Do not fall for the rating!
","I was looking to watch some nice comedy flick over the weekend. Did some research and finalized on this one. IMDB rating-check. User reviews-check (and why didn't I filter on low ratings! ).
Anyways, so the movie is about sort of a loser, professionally and romantically, who is dumped by his girlfriend. People in the office don't take him very highly. He got flatmates, one who doesn't work and plays games, and there is another one who is serious about life. Our guy is obviously close to the gamer guy. After heartbreak, our guy and the doper-gamer drink the entire night only to wake up next day hungover to find out people are turning to zombies and they need to save themselves before any zombie bites them. So they kill a few zombies wandering around their house and get their mate's car to save his mother and stepdad. And then, his girlfriend and her mates. They head off to their favorite bar thinking it would be safe place but as expected isn't so and they are surrounded by zombies all around. The loser becomes the leader. Movie is very light hearted but it is like usual crass comedies out there, which have few scenes that may make you smirk but none of them actually making you lol and most of them making you meh. There is no proper character development, nothing convincing enough as to why the girlfriend dumps him and why he hates the stepdad and few other tits and bits. Movie is bland and absolutely flat. Or may be i never liked the British humour."

","I don't have any business giving this movie an '8' rating but it was so hilarious I can't help it. I'd heard so much about the film that I finally got around to catching it the other night. I really relate to deadpan humor (no pun intended), and Simon Pegg was just perfect here with his band of merry misfits trying to outrun a London zombie apocalypse. The British colloquialisms are an added bonus, newly discovered terms I can now add to my own vocabulary because 'fried gold' and 'shambolic' just sound so cool. Another mark of an entertaining movie when it makes you think or look things up, which I did. You can too."
"mistoppi","9","1","4","22 March 2016"," One of my favourite horror comedies!
","I've seen one movie by Edgar Wright before, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. It's a great movie, but I didn't expect this movie to be anything like that, of course. Well, to be honest, since I am so used to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, it was a surprise for me how violent this movie turned out to be, even though that should be obvious when we're dealing with a movie of this genre. I didn't know much about this film before seeing it, apart from it having zombies in it, and that really doesn't tell anything. Still, I assumed this would be like Zombieland, except a few British spices.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is quite similar to Zombieland, or rather Zombieland is similar to Shaun of the Dead. However, Shaun of the Dead has several things that make it better than Zombieland. The humour is very different in Shaun of the Dead. It seems more... British. And Shaun of the Dead has a lot scarier moments. While Zombieland is funny action almost all through the movie, Shaun of the Dead has situations that feel almost hopeless, and you are actually terrified for the characters. With Zombieland that doesn't work, because it's such a typical movie you don't really even bother to think something would happen to the characters. It's just not that type of movie. But something about Shaun of the Dead makes you think there's no certainty anyone will survive. <br/><br/>The funniest thing about this movie is how slowly everyone notices that there are zombies. The audience can of course see it, and it's almost annoying how the characters ignore everything happening around them. It's funny because it could really happen. Come on, how long would it take from us to see what's happening?<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is now probably my favourite zombie movie. The plot might be typical for a zombie themed film, but that doesn't matter. It's violent, it's funny and while it might be slightly predictable, it's still entertaining to watch. This might be tied with Jennifer's Body as my favourite horror comedy I got on this ship too late, but if there's someone out there who still hasn't seen this film, watch it! If you're not put off by violence and zombies, you won't regret it."
"robsta23","8","1","4","5 January 2016"," More Comedic than Horrifying, Watch for a Good Time
","Blending the genres of horror and comedy together is done well on occasion, but more often it is done poorly, especially when you look at the ""Scary Movie"" franchise which parodies contemporary horror films by referencing them directly and making surface level jokes out of the situations. Luckily, with Shaun of the Dead, we get an intelligent comedy which is original in style and clever with its treatment of a zombie outbreak.<br/><br/>We all know the concept of the zombie movie. A curse, or a sickness, or radioactivity etc. causes the dead to ""live again"" to feed on the flesh and brains of living human beings. Most of the time they are slow walkers which is the case of Shaun of the Dead. Wright takes this concept and makes comparisons between the outbreak and normal life for Shaun. A motif shot used in the film focuses on Shaun slowly getting out of bed in the morning, walking in a zombie-like fashion towards the door while yawning in a way very similar to the noise zombies tend to make. The average working-class man is like a zombie in a swarm: lazy, conforming to and blending in with the rest of the swarm, and insignificant compared to the swarm as a whole.<br/><br/>2 long takes that are done early in the film also compare society in a normal universe to one filled with zombies. Shaun is nonchalant in both of these sequences when he walks to a convenience store to buy a few items - he does not notice the difference, but in the first sequence he interacts with people a little more than in the second, but it seems that he really does not care about his surroundings too much, even though they change drastically in the second sequence when the zombie outbreak has already begun.<br/><br/>While this is a zombie movie and is gruesome at some moments with guts and blood, the zombie violence seems more cartoonish than disturbing. The comedy in this movie outweighs the horror in this film in every fashion, including the violence.<br/><br/>This film is solid on pacing and editing. While it seems to have an average pace at first, it really picks up once the zombies become a problem in the film. The editing is really interesting, making simple actions feel intense by using quick cuts between closeups which force us into the ""action."" Wright also has an interesting way of putting action scenes in sync exactly to the music in the background. In fact, a scene involving action to the rhythm of a song by Queen proves to be on of the best in the film.<br/><br/>The story itself could be a little more interesting to be honest. We never get a thorough explanation of what causes the zombie outbreak, though this film does not feel like it needs one. The story revolving around Shaun and his friends and family is very straightforward - Shaun goes through a breakup early on, but tries to become a hero for his ex and for his family once he realizes the scale of the situation.<br/><br/>Good comedy and a few unexpectedly well-done dramatic moments make this film enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"vinsim27","10","1","4","22 May 2015"," Not just an excellent satire of zombie films, but an excellent zombie film in general.
","This film accomplishes what I want every parody to do. Add humor, but also build a story of your own. This film is ingeniously written. The story is excellent and it combines serious and humorous elements and it actually works.<br/><br/>Shaun and his group of survivors serve as excellent contrast for both the comedy and the drama. Of course, like in every Edgar Wright film, the visual comedy separates this film from other comedies that are completely depenant on improvisation.<br/><br/>As the first of the three flavors Cornetto trilogy, Shaun of the Dead is a classic and is even on par with the original George A. Romero films."

","Probably no one will read this, but I am a product of gen-x and narcissistic enough to write a review anyway. Let me start at the beginning. This movie made me laugh uncontrollably and sit on the edge of my seat when I was a young idealistic student. Now that I am an old, cynical hag, I still find this movie very entertaining and not just because of the obvious laughs. I really think this movie is the perfect movie of my generation. I think it has been said before, but still, this movie is somehow one of the most truthful, existential commentaries on post-modern humanity. I won't say how it happened because I don't know and I am too lazy to do the real research, but I know an existential masterpiece when I see one. This movie by using the subtext of a zombie apocalypse , taps into the deepest questions of what it means to be a post-modern adult and the extreme angst that many of the generation x have felt in the disintegration of a family unit and an identity after being raised on such ideals as Happy Days and The Brady Bunch. And I think it was one of the firsts to tap into that whole zombie apocalypse angst which is now common fodder. These characters are so identifiable and lovable that you can follow their journey of discovery and ultimately find hope in the future. Because, really, ""I want to believe."""
"williampsamuel","9","1","4","15 January 2015"," The Zombie Apocalypse Has Never Been So Much Fun
","Shaun of the Dead is not your typical zombie movie. Sure, there's lots of blood and gore, flesh eating zombies aplenty, and F-bombs beyond counting. And like most zombie flicks, this one follows an ever shrinking band of civilians as they try to survive against the undead hordes. But unlike Resident Evil, the remade Dawn of the Dead, or 28 Weeks Later, Shaun of the Dead is smart, witty, and absolutely hilarious. For those dazed by grim, near identical shoot-em-ups with about as much intelligence as the monsters they portray, Shaun of the Dead is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>At first, it actually seems like a typical slacker comedy. Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a thoroughly average Londoner who shares a flat with his friends from high school, works the day shift at the local electronics store, has issues with his stepfather, and is in a rut with his girlfriend, who dumps him after he screws up their anniversary. In short, his life sucks. At this point the last thing he needs is hordes of mindless undead knocking at his door. But when the zombie apocalypse descends on England, it just might be his chance to show he's not a complete loser after all.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead starts off strong, delivering hilarious romantic comedy while dropping ominous hints of what lies ahead, like a demented version of The Birds. And it only gets funnier when the zombies get involved. Writers Pegg and Edger Wright manage to effortlessly lampoon the clichÃ©s and improbabilities common to all zombie films, while using over the top gore for comic effect in a manner that would do Terentino proud. There are few things funnier than seeing two morons throwing records and video games at a pair of glacially slow zombies, except perhaps watching them beat said zombies back to death with a cricket bat and a shovel, all the while screaming like the warriors they wish they could be.<br/><br/>Even better is how even amongst terror and destruction, the hassles and concerns of everyday life are still there. Running into old friends, and their friends, and their friends' friends is still awkward, even when you're on the run from the living dead. Your mother remains deeply concerned about you and your stepfather, and is happier about finally meeting your girlfriend than frightened by the wandering zombies. There's still the one guy who would rather face the walking corpses than spend another minute with the rest of the group. And trust me; there's no time like the end of the world to work out your relationship issues.<br/><br/>These are the kinds of personal issues that have sunk movies like War of the World, but played out to a level of true absurdity they are utterly side-splitting. And the chemistry between cast members is remarkable. They bicker, argue, and get on each other's nerves like they've known each other for their entire lives. More than once, it occurred to me that this movie could be considered Night of the Living Dead meets the Office.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead isn't for everyone. It's violent, it's gory, and people in it swear like stevedores. But it just might be the best horror/comedy since the days of Abbot and Costello. And on some level it's comforting to know that even during the zombie apocalypse, you mom's still your mom, your roommate's still an idiot, and you and your sort-of girlfriend still have lots of serious issues to discuss."

Along the way, he also fights with his mother and stepfather.<br/><br/>Whlie suffering from a hangover, he and his friends are attacked by zombies. The violence is typical and the comedy repetitive and tiresome. I do not understand the 8/10 rating on IMDb.

Meant as homage to George Romero (the title of course referring to Romero's Dawn of the Dead and therefor the undead being nothing like the ones from the Dawn Remake), this little movie is pure genius.<br/><br/>One of the references, involves a phone conversation with ""Barbara"", which made me laugh out loud in the cinema. And I was the only one laughing. I almost felt bad about it, but then again, even Romero himself didn't get the in-joke (if you're a filmmaker you'll understand, that certain things are more precious to fans of the movies, then they are to you).<br/><br/>But it's not only that. It's the fact, that this movie goes all the way (no pun intended). I was surprised how brutal it was (I didn't know the rating back then, it was shown in a sneak Preview).

I never thought I would root for anyone as clueless as Shaun and Ed. Ed (Nick Frost) goes a long way to endearing himself to the audience. He grew on me, sort of like the mold you imagine is growing on everything he touches from where he is seemingly permanently installed on Shaun's sofa.

"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","4","28 January 2008"," A true horror/comedy
","Shaun of the Dead is one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of seeing. Not only is it a perfect blend of gruesome zombie horror ala Romero's Dead series and unique British comedy much like the TV series ""Spaced"" (which is from the same group of guys) but it has plenty of heart and is made surprisingly well for a first time film. Every single actor embellishes their role (be it big or small) and makes the most out of it which is a major positive. Edgar Wright (director) shows a style very different to the many other horror/comedy directors and presents to us an entirely original film. He also knows how to reference other films subtlety but still laugh out loud funny.<br/><br/>The story, written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, focuses on Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his current situation in life. He lives in a house with his best friend Ed (Nick Frost) and other friend Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and spends most of his nights at 'The Winchester,' a local pub, with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) and her friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran). Not only does Liz split up with Shaun after he fails as a boyfriend, he has to cope with his mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and his step-dad Philip (Bill Nighy) who he hates with a passion. And to top it off he has to deal with the undead who have started to rise from ground for the flesh of the living.....<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are two actors to watch out for and they really shine in this. Not only are they comic geniuses they can also act a dramatic scene very well. The supporting cast are just as good though and it would be a crime not to mention them as well. Fans of zombie movies will pick up the the many references scattered throughout and will also appreciate the occasional scenes of carnage. ""Shaun of the Dead"" is also a great parody and social satire. During the opening credits we see people going about their daily business in a zombie-like manner, implying we are already zombies and the point is further proved when Shaun walks through a zombie infested neighborhood going about his daily business and not noticing anything unusual.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" further proves that the British are the best when it comes to making comedies and it also seems horror. A solid 5/5"
"ronansdad","6","1","4","17 September 2007"," credit where it is due
","the zombie/comedy genre is somewhat limited to judge Shaun of the dead, as far as the comedy goes it is humorous but not hilarious, but then very few movies can sustain the laughs. as for the horror; it is not and could not compete with the likes of the dawn of the dead remake and there is every reason to avoid that degree of horror. as for plot; well, it is well thought out with a descent preamble that is actually plausible considering it is a zombie movie and is free of the plot holes that seem to plague many movies such as 28 days later.<br/><br/>the main thrust of criticism beyond the inappropriate comparisons with other zombie movies is the humour and characters' unlovable behaviour but this misses the key plot element. it is a rites of passage movie where Shaun has yet to grow up and treat his life and women seriously requiring a crisis for him to move on. As a story of the child moving into responsible adulthood, even at 29! it is one of the few where the protagonist actually shoots his mother. It has its clever moments and part of that is the nature of the adolescent humour without it we would not be able to track his passage.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead does a good job considering that it is a low budget comedy horror, it may not be American werewolf which is a classic but it is as funny and as a movie the script and plot are a whole lot more tighter than dog soldiers or 28 days or 28weeks. It is not going to be as scary or horrific as zombie movies but it is comparable IMHO, to the original Dawn of the Dead that had the depth of observation as part of the subplot.<br/><br/>it seems to be one of those movies that will be compared when it needs to be judged on its own merits."

Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) seem like slackers who like to play video games, and Sahun is certainly lazy and inconsiderate where his girlfriend (Kate Ashfield) is concerned. But, the film quickly moves to the zombie part, and that is where the real laughs begin. Of course Shaun is quick on the uptake (not a surprise for a slacker) and doesn't get the fact that there is danger right away. No prob, the cricket bat works where the records and flatware doesn't. It is a brilliant send-up of the zombie genre, and the funny bits are just too numerous to mention. Also includes Pirates star Bill Nighy, who will join Pegg and Frost this weekend in Hot Fuzz.

","Shaun is a loser. Of that there is no doubt. He shares a North London house with Pete, an uptight professional, and a total slob called Ed. Ed is his best mate from school and Shaun feels very protective of him. Shaun works as a sort of team leader in a branch of an Electrical shop where he suffers the daily tedium we have all felt when you work in a job you don't really like. His girlfriend, Liz, is dragged along by him every night the The Winchester, his local pub. As Shaun always brings Ed along, ""Ed doesn't have many friends"", so Liz brings along her flat mates, David and Dianne. After being dumped by Liz (For forgetting to book a restaurant and for trying to give her flowers destined for his mum), Shaun and Ed proceed to get massively drunk in the Winchester and head home to play loud music (annoying Pete in the process). However, the next morning and with huge hangovers, Shaun and Ed begin, very slowly, to realise that this is not a normal Sunday. It doesn't matter if you dislike horror films, romantic comedies or if you aren't a fan of British humour. This film will raise a chuckle at least, and have you roaring with laughter at best. George A Romero is a fan, as is Quentin Tarrantino. High praise indeed. My favourite moment? Well there are so many to choose from so I have to narrow it down to three. 1) Shaun's Sunday visit to the local shop where he fails to notice Zombie Nelson at the back of the shop, the bloody hand print on the drinks chiller and what it was on the floor which he slipped in. 2)In the lounge after their battle with the two Zombies in the back garden, where they are deciding on the best course of action; Ed: ""So what are we gonna do now?"" Shaun:""Have a sit down?"" 3) When they are in the garden next to the Winchester, Shaun checks that the coast is clear by climbing up the steps of a child's slide. Superb comic timing! Shaun:""I'm just going to check that the coast is clear"" (Climbs up few steps leaving us just with a shot of his legs and shoes on the rungs, pause for a few seconds, climbs back down into shot) Liz: ""Well, is it clear?"" Shaun:""No."" David:""So how many are there?"" Shaun: (Sounding like he's going to cry)""Lots.""<br/><br/>Great film, I urge you to watch it!!!!"

","Shaun of the Dead, the first of the so-called Romantic Zombie Comedies (or RomZomComs to those of us in the know) is an adorable romance with a sharp comedic edge. In addition, it delivers some punches just as terrifying as those in such zombie movie classics as Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. Great as a date movie, a Halloween horror flick, or a late-night comedy to watch instead of studying for finals, Shaun of the Dead is destined to become a cult classic.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Shaun (Simon Pegg; co-writer of the movie with Edgar Wright), a loser whose already complicated personal life begins to spiral out of control when his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him because he forgets to make dinner reservations for their anniversary. On top of this he is scolded by his stepfather Philip (played by a wonderfully crusty Bill Nighy) for failing to bring his mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) flowers on Mother's day, and gets into a shouting match with Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), the more responsible of his two roommates. Pete accuses Shaun of only letting Ed (Nick Frost), his video game playing, pot dealing, perpetually drunk best friend, stay with them because he's ""more of a loser than you."" All of this is even before Shaun wakes up the next morning, depressed and hung over from a night of trying to drown his sorrows at the local pub, the Winchester, to discover that London has turned overnight from a bustling metropolis into a city of the undead. This is the moment when Shaun of the Dead takes off as both a horror movie and a comedy.<br/><br/>Much of the film's comedy comes from simply pushing the usual zombie thriller and romantic comedy clichÃ©s too far. In one of the most hilarious and paradoxically chilling sequences of the entire movie, Shaun stumbles blearily through his morning routine completely blind to the zombies in the streets and the dead bodies lying in gardens. This sequence parodies the idea that the audience always gets a glimpse of the impending disaster before the characters. We have been seeing signs of the zombie infestation since the beginning of the film, but Shaun and Ed fail to notice it until a girl in their garden falls and impales herself on a pipe that goes completely through her body, then struggles back up and keeps staggering towards them.<br/><br/>At this point Shaun and Ed decide to ignore all rational advice and venture out of their apartment (which is not really a safe place anyway since Pete has been bitten by a zombie, and will soon become one of the undead himself) to find Liz and Barbara and take them to the safest place they can think of; the Winchester. All does not go according to plan, however, and Shaun, Ed, Liz, Barbara, and Liz's roommates David and Dianne (Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis) end up walking through the backyards of the London suburbs, having lost both their car and the blunt objects they were using as weapons for defense against a zombie attack. Things only get worse from there, and by the time the hapless group reaches the Winchester an argument concerning Shaun's treatment of Liz has exploded between Shaun and David and one of their number has fallen victim to a zombie bite. Shaun and David's argument is a wonderful example of standard romantic comedy writing that is funny because of its juxtaposition to the army of the dead waiting outside the pub.<br/><br/>This sort of exaggerated comedy begins in the opening credits when we see the people of London moving zombie-like through their daily routines; many of them appear later in the film trying to feast on the flesh of Shaun and his cohorts. The satirical edge continues until the end of the film, where various TV clips lampoon the careless way that people trivialize immense tragedy. Moments of slapstick are likewise woven into the entire movie; some notable scenes include Shaun and Ed sorting through Shaun's record collection to determine which albums are of low-enough quality to use as weapons against the undead and, in what is possibly the best use of a Queen song since Mike Meyers rocked out to Bohemian Rhapsody, Shaun, Liz, and Ed smashing out a zombie's brains to ""Don't Stop Me Now.""<br/><br/>Despite the hilarity of the comedy, the movie manages to do what any good horror film should do; pack a frightening punch. The feeling of fear is introduced early in the movie as glimpses of the zombie epidemic create a building sense of unease, and continues until the fate of the living is finally decided. The zombies may be ridiculously slow and dull-witted but they can be terrifying, especially when large numbers of them are bearing down on Shaun and his friends. It is this combination of comedy, horror, and good old-fashioned romance which guarantees that the first of the RomZomComs is well on its way to becoming a cult classic."

","Shaun of the Dead. Wow. That name really rings a bell.

British humor is the best kind of humor there is. This movie stars some unknown actors: Simon Pegg (Mission: Impossible III, The Reckoning), Nick Frost (Kinky Boots, Penelope), and Kate Ashfield (Crime and Punishment, The War Zone).<br/><br/>Not only does this movie bring nonstop deep-belly-laughs, it's also deliciously gory, as every zombie movie is. But it's really not that gory, there's just a scene where a zombie falls on a pole, and a huge fountain of blood spurts out of her body. And there's a couple more, but I can't think of them at the top of my head right now, sorry.<br/><br/>What's better than zombie's invading a town and then leaves two sloppy and lazy friends, Shaun (Pegg) and Ed (Frost) to kill them all? What's more of an unbeatable combination between horror and comedy? What's better than totally unknown actors bringing hilarity to people? Nothing! There is nothing better than a zomrom com (the nickname for a zombie-comedy).<br/><br/>See this movie!

","A man (Simon Pegg) decides to turn his moribund life around by winning back his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield), reconciling his relationship with his mother (Penelope Wilton), and dealing with an entire community that has returned from the dead to eat the living.<br/><br/>What makes this film atypical of most horror films is that it is not a horror film at all, but a romantic comedy... only it is a romantic comedy filled with zombies and head-crushing action. We follow Shaun, who fights to win his girlfriend Liz back... fights zombies, that is.<br/><br/>The humor is distinctly British, and some of the humor relies on a familiarity with the show ""Spaced"", which is probably not well known to the general audience. Much of the jokes are also obscure references to other horror films. But most of the humor is universal, as we all probably know what it is like to have a bad day, have a bad job, and have things go wrong with a great woman (or man, as the case may be). And all too many of us know what it is like to live with a deadbeat roommate.<br/><br/>The zombie effects are pretty decent, though not as gory as in many films. The humor outweighs the scary obviously. The scenery is great, and many of the scenes are so derivative of ""Dawn of the Dead"" that it is hard not to like this film. (Some scenes, some music and even some dialog is lifted directly from Romero... such as news broadcasts and the classic ""We're coming to get you, Barbara."") I enjoyed the multiple times a character was told not to call the zombies ""zombies""... because it calls to mind the great difference between horror movie characters and horror movie viewers. (Horror movie viewers know Romero made zombie films, but the word ""zombie"" is not used in those films... even the ""Dawn"" remake never once calls them ""zombies"".) <br/><br/>I do not know if I would make this a must-see movie, but it is one of those films that everyone has seen, so you probably would not be a true horror fan unless you have seen it, too. And the way it went on to influence zombie films and zombie comedies over the next decade is incredible, culminating in the nearly-as-good ""Cockneys Vs. Zombies"", that any ""Shaun"" fan should be sure to see. Stephen King proclaimed it was ""destined to be a cult classic."" He was right."

But on to the story; Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a loser, who at 29 has a lousy job, and lives with a really immature best friend, Ed (Nick Frost), managing to unwittingly destroy his relationship with Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br/><br/>After having been dumped by her, Shaun decides to put his life into some kind of order; too bad the dead are coming back to life (but please, don't say the zed-word, it's ridiculous).<br/><br/>After finding out about it (and believe me, it takes a while) and noticing their third roommate, Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), has actually become a Living Dead himself, Shaun and Ed set on saving Shaun's mother Barbara (one character actually says 'We're coming to get you, Barbara!' - remember NOTLD?) (Penelope Wilton), Shaun's stepfather, who has been bitten (Bill Nighy), Liz and her snooty friends David (Dylan Moran) and Diane (Lucy Davis).<br/><br/>They have one destination; the 'Winchester' pub, the one where Shaun and Ed pass their whole days. Will they get there? And who will survive? There are some homages to famous zombie movies - NOTLD (one of the female characters vanishes into a flood of zombies), Dawn Of The Dead (a character is ripped apart much like Tom Savini's), 28 Days Later (won't tell... find it yourselves) - which for Living Dead Lovers (like me) are really the icing on the cake, and really funny moments; deciding what vinyls to throw at zombies ('Dire Straits?' 'Chuck it.' or 'It's the second record I ever bought!'), Shaun and a 'smiling' Living Dead Girl getting photographed by Ed, Ed's cellphone going off at a rather inopportune moment, Shaun missing out on obvious clues about the Living Dead (namely, one hysterical scene in which he does zapping and all the programs he watches complete each other's sentence which should drive home the message to Shaun... but it doesn't) and the funniest scene - when Shaun meets Yvonne and her own band of survivors, which mirror Shaun and the other five (as I have seen, also in TV work - 'Yvonne' worked on 'Spaced' with Pegg, if I'm not wrong, and there were Tim from 'The Office' - Lucy Davis is from 'The Office' too, and Fran from 'Black Books' - Dylan Moran (David) plays in it too).<br/><br/>And you just can't fault Romero, Tarantino and Peter Jackson for having liked this so much, and Romero for having wanted Pegg and Frost in 'Land Of The Dead'.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead: 10/10."

The horror aspect of the movie is only in the violence which is also part of the comedy aspect.

","When me and a couple of mates rented this, we thought it obviously was some kind of parody of Dawn of the Dead, which just had been released.

After seeing it, it stuck in my mind, so I had to buy it later.<br/><br/>Even though it's a comedy, the story is really apocalyptic, and like in ""Dawn"" the city gets invaded by zombies, which is nothing you saw in Dawn of the Dead as funny but rather horrible. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are really convincing as regular guys trying to make the best out of the situation. They are also extremely funny while doing it.

","I just watched Shaun of the Dead and i have to say I'm a bit disappointed cause it had a 7.9 IMDb rating i did expect a bit more from a movie which is rated so high but anyway, it's not a bad movie at all. It starts a bit boring when the main character (Shaun) is introduced but as soon as the Zombies come into play it gets fun. Shaun turns into a hero ( like Lionel from Peter Jackson's Braindead ) and the movie turns into a amusing Splatter - Comedy. Another point which is to be mentioned is that there aren't that many splatter scenes in this movie, i mean if you compare it to other Zombie films you're gonna know what i mean. So although Shaun of the Dead is not a bad movie you can be sure that there are better movies of this genre ( Braindead, Army of Darkness and many others) , so i think its overrated!Anyway,watch it!"
"chrishn","5","1","4","27 January 2005"," Moments of fun, nothing more
","I like zombie movies, old as well as new. Shaun of the Dead is both a parody of the zombie genre, and also a satirical comment about how ordinary life makes us act like zombies. For instance we get to see the zombie-like appearance of people at work and people on the street. This element is well thought out and quite clever. <br/><br/>It makes fun of the stupid and slow zombies which ends up in some sporadically fun scenes. As in all zombie movies the main characters takes ages to discover what is going on and in the Shaun of the Dead, it's overdone in a hilarious way. The story itself is basically: ""where does a British lowlife run for protection?"". Answer: ""The pub"". (Short period of laughter followed by boredom). The story is boring and not at all fun, and the great moments of parody or satire are to few to save the movie.<br/><br/>Fun moments, but nothing more.<br/><br/>5/10"

The references to Monty Python were subtle, and the slapstick was wholly effective.<br/><br/>A bit predictable, but the fresh take on the genre made it worthwhile to watch.

"The_Void","8","1","4","8 December 2004"," An original and refreshing fusion of two genres
","In 2003, Britain tried it's hand at the zombie film; and failed, with the frankly miserable '28 Days Later...'. Then the zombie sub-genre was given another film in 2004; the hugely disappointing remake of the classic 'Dawn of the Dead', and both of these things were leading me think that this parody of the zombie genre might miss the mark as well; but suffice to say, this one doesn't disappoint. If you're expecting to be rolling around on the floor laughing at this movie, you'll be disappointed, but although it's never hilarious, it does keep itself going with a series of giggles, which is sure to delight any viewer. The plot follows Shaun; a young slob that spends most of his time drinking in the pub and playing video games with his even lazier friend. When his girlfriend dumps him on the grounds of him being an unreliable loser, he thinks it's the end of the world....and actually, it is; as, for some reason, the population of London has been transformed into flesh eating zombies and it's now up to Shaun, with the aid of his trusty cricket bat, to save the day! <br/><br/>I often find myself disliking films that spoof the horror genre as there's just something I don't like about someone taking the Michael out of something I love, but some of the sequences in Shaun of the Dead really are inspired moments of comedy. The parts that see the Shaun go about his daily business,completely unaware that people around him are eating each other show a rare brilliance that few comedies have ever matched. As you've probably heard, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have labeled this film a'RomZomCom', which, of course, means that it is a romantic comedy, with zombies. That's almost exactly what it is, with the romantic comedy making up the structure of the movie, and the zombies being thrown in afterwards. Ironically, since most people will see this for the zombies; the romantic comedy elements of the movie are, on the whole, funnier than the parts with the zombies. After a great initial forty minutes, after which is when the zombies start to really come into play, the movie loses steam and you don't find yourself giggling so often. However, it's forgivable as the comedy gets replaced by some great horror sequences, many of which are lifted from the zombie classics, such as Romero's 'Dead' trilogy and The Evil Dead films.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead stars two of the main players from the cult comedy 'Spaced'; Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, along with a couple of other regulars from that show, and some other players from various British comedy shows. I have to admit to never having watched Spaced, but I can see that it's written by two obviously talented people, and I may well give it a try on the strength of this film. Simon Pegg's performance is silly, but believable at the same time. He does, actually, appear to be doing an impression of The Office's David Brent for most of the movie; but that's fine with me. Pegg and Frost get to play with a nice assortment of weapons for this film, from cricket bats to snooker cues to shotguns and more (but no chainsaw...) and it's a lot of fun seeing them running around and bashing the undead on the head. This film is a lot of fun on the whole, and I am proud to say that this decade finally has a good zombie film, and I'm even more proud to say that it originates from my home nation...even if it's cast do drink Carling Black Label..."

I know damn-well that everyone was, indeed, speaking English (or, at least, I think they were), but with all of the bloody heavy-duty British accents, and the weird/alien slang, and the annoying way that everyone was always running all their goddamn words together - Well - As you can well-imagine, it was making me so ABSOLUTELY CRAZY!!<br/><br/>Believe me, there were many-many times when I know for sure that I had just missed out on getting the punchline of yet another killer-diller joke.

"walsh-22","7","1","5","4 June 2007"," Mixed feelings about the film
","I was really looking forward to watching this film as everyone was raving about what a brilliant scary film it was. What also made me want to watch the film was that it was made in Britain and until recently, there has been real surge of horror films made in Britain which I am glad about.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed when I finished watching it. It wasn't rubbish but it wasn't excellent. I think what has left me with mixed feelings about Shaun of the dead is the film seems to be mainly a comedy and there are some very funny bits which I will get back to in a minute. The thing is all these funny things happen and you're laughing away and then the film changes tact and becomes more serious with Shaun having to kill his mum after she is beaten by a zombie and then Dianne and David being killed by the zombies, it just didn't sit right for the film to suddenly go down this route when basically for most of the film we were laughing at the antics of the zombies and I just couldn't get back into the film after seeing him kill his own mother. I even wondered because the violence involved towards the end if it would turn out to be all a dream but it wasn't to be. I feel like the film couldn't decide what genre it was going to be and if it was to be more horror driven, then there should not have been as much comedy as there was so in that respect I think the film let itself down there.<br/><br/>The other part of me liked the film especially at the start when we see that we are in a way zombies ourselves. We all go to work, queue in lines, go shopping without really thinking about what we are doing.<br/><br/>I love the fact that Shaun is an anti-hero in this. He is in a job that is mundane and no-one respects him there. He spends all his time going to the pub and just drinking and isn't interested in doing anything else. Then London's population starts to turn into zombies and he becomes a leader who the others turn to, to get them out of the situation they are in and he finds himself battling zombies and becoming the most unlikely hero you have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>I was in stitches with the humour especially when the zombies are introduced into the story line. I have mentioned down below my favourite humorous scenes. One scene is when Shaun and Ed have Shaun's record collection and they are debating about what records to throw at zombies while the zombies are coming towards them. Two, Shaun introducing his girlfriend to his mother when they are trying to get away from the zombies. Three, Shaun's gang meeting up with Yvonne's gang who are basically the same type of characters but played by well-known television actors that have worked with Shaun's (Simon Pegg) gang in other television programmes. Classic! The last is the duke box playing Queen's 'Don't Stop me now' when they are beating up the zombie landlord with pool cues.<br/><br/>I think the zombie make up works so well and is so convincing and I like the fact the film doesn't take itself too seriously."
"ineedaneasyfriend","8","1","5","10 May 2007"," Kevin Smith + 28 Days Later=""Shaun of the Dead.""
","I rarely watch horror movies, and that is a personal precedent that might be given leeway now, thanks to ""Shaun of the Dead."" With memorable characters, subtle humor, genuine emotive scenes and conversations, and a jovial hell-bent fight scene involving a man beating a zombie to death while Queen plays on the jukebox cements this new twist on the slacker comedy as creative and ground-breaking (even though this has been done before in my other favorite horror movie, ""Idle Hands""; Oh, well. I guess the phrase, ""great minds think alike"" is true). ""Shaun of the Dead"" is blessed (and armed) with an almost-original script, deft direction, and the show stealer of the movie, Nick Frost, who plays the fat sloth-like pothead. Sure, the last third of the movie may drag on, but I have had a rewarding time watching the shrewdness of the crises between the characters and the Laurel & Hardy chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I guess I can see now why the British are better at executing films than us. They rely on knowledge and inside jokes, while we utilize recycled toilet humor. Damn, we suck. But that's a different story for a different time.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays a slacker named Shaun who is definitely in dire straits, and has an idyllic, boring, unfulfilling life for the time being. What happens to Shaun is enough to make an average guy depressed. His girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him; he has a sour relationship with his stepfather (Bill Nighy), a tense roommate who can't stand his pathetic friend (Nick Frost), a dismal job, and the icing of the cake is fighting zombies. During the tenure of the weekend, a zombie outbreak spreads (with Shaun and everyone he knows, totally oblivious to the matter, which is pretty clever, considering that the director, Edgar Wright, has put so much dramatic irony and clues leading up to what happens next), and Shaun and his friend, Ed (Nick Frost) don't figure it out until one of the outbreak victims show up at the flat. After the guys finish killing the zombies invading the fort, they try to save their friends and family, with dire straits happening now and then, usually antagonized by Liz's friend, an arrogant oaf named David (Dylan Moran).<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's screenplay is gifted in the way that they shape out Shaun's character, by using the ""zombie plot"" as the backdrop of him changing as a person. In the beginning of the film, you would assume that Shaun is really irresponsible, and that he was just like a character in a sitcom that doesn't really make a change or develop until the last season. But, the way Wright and Pegg make use of the plot to change Shaun is beyond belief. If the plot centered on something else, Shaun wouldn't have come to amends with his stepfather or find out about the nature of David and why he's acting like such a tool towards him. The film also fares well in its dramatic shift of tone and genre when the ragtag team tries to find fortress in the town pub. I guess that what stands out in ""SOTD"" for me, is the relationship between Frost and Pegg. When these two are paired up together (primarily in conversations), there's no end to all the absurd shtick that Frost provides and the levelheaded answers that Pegg would give him. All in all, there are many other qualities that make ""SOTD"" one of the coolest cult flicks (including Deer Hunter and the Dead series references) ever, and it's everything you'll ever want in a movie. It's a pulsating horror movie (at least three or four parts), an enigmatic look on people who find out more about themselves in midst of danger, and a straightforward, riotous comedy."

","The critical phenomenon ""Shaun of the Dead"" inspired is baffling. I saw it in the theater, found it a lightly diverting item with a touch of humor amid the horror (the romantic and domestic drama isn't nearly as successful), but nowhere near the brilliant masterpiece horror fans and mainstream critics were hailing it as. Maybe I have a bit of resiliency towards thick-accented English romps, but ""Shaun of the Dead"" feels dramatically awkward and stilted in its humor (it plays out with a hand that's more heavy than incendiary); even the zombies and their ensuing carnage lack grit and terror. That being said, this homage to George Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy has its moments, as we follow thankless twentysomething Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his deadbeat roommate Ed (Nick Frost), as they navigate through an unexplained zombie plague...so that Shaun can reconcile with his estranged girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield). In the end, its pervasive sincere charm and some clever in-jokes (Shaun works at ""Foree Electronics,"" for instance) keep ""Shaun"" watchable, but the premise is ultimately funnier than the movie itself."

In a hilarious portrayal of just how oblivious someone can be to the world around him, Shaun, bent on winning his girlfriend back, travels the city with zombies wandering about. It isn't until much later that he and his buddy Ed discover they are the new minority in town.

","I've heard a lot of things about this movie and how 'funny' it is, but after seeing it myself I have to disagree. It's the predictable zombie movie with the usual gore and violence. I chuckled at a few parts, but overall it was rather drab and boring. The beginning was quirky and humorous, but as it went on it seemed as if they had run out of ideas and completely lost the plot. Perhaps I just have a short attention span, but by the last half hour or so I couldn't concentrate on it at all. Not to mention it actually got a bit sad at parts, which I really didn't expect coming from a comedy. Really the only thing that held this movie together was the decent casting. I wouldn't say the movie was downright terrible, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a real quality picture."
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","6","30 October 2006"," What exactly is ""Spaced""?
","I've read a lot about how ""Shaun of the Dead"" borrows a lot from a TV show called ""Spaced"". I have to admit that I've never heard of ""Spaced"". But even so, this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it's sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it, and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I'd never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing ""SOTD"", but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline's wife in ""Cry Freedom"") and Bill Nighy."

I couldn't help but pray for the main characters to be the first ones that go. It seems that certain flicks automatically earn points just for being British productions.

","Shaun of the dead is a classic that have aged well. Not too dependent on effects, it feels like it could have been made last year (instead of 15 years ago). One of the first movies of what has now almost turned into an genre (World war Z, I am Legend and son on) it still has a unique and what still feels like a fresh perspective on the zombie apocalypse. Instead of being scary, Simon Peggs Shaun intends to do so well, but it never works out as he wants it to, often with quit fun implications. He and his friend Ed, not the brightest men around, try to rescue Shaun's (ex-)girlfriend and mother, evacuating them from their homes to take refuge in the Winchester pub. And if you can't outrun the zombies, you need to fight them. And if you can't fight them, you migt as well try to blend in...<br/><br/>It is a good idea, a fun story, with quite a lot of good scenes and moments with a lot of laughs. However, a few of the characters are just too much. They are too ignorant, too stupid, just too much. I think of Ed and Shaun's mother Barbara. By exaggerating the characters they go from fun to annoying. And that ruins quite a few scenes unfortunately.

","This movie didn't resonate with me.<br/><br/>As charming as Pegg and Frost with their magnificent chemistry, this does not equal comedy and I feel a bit embarassed watching them.<br/><br/>The zombie aspect (when it finally comes) is pretty brutal. All the more so for its comic timing and quite welcome since until that point it is a pretty generic piece of relationship drama where Pegg just keeps getting it wrong.<br/><br/>But I there really aren't any jokes. I like dark humour, but that's more than dark stuff with a pop music soundtrack. It's not really dark comedy, it's more like ""here's something macabre presented flippantly. You can laugh now."" Family Guy knows how to make things you shouldn't joke about seem like the funniest thing ever. It's because they make it into a joke rather than trusting transgressive themes ARE the joke. The movie seems somewhat lazy in that regard.<br/><br/>The romantic interest is also pretty bland.<br/><br/>The movie does not skimp on the gore though.

"BandSAboutMovies","10","0","1","20 February 2019"," A movie with heart (and other things)
","The first time I watched this movie - the first of hundreds of viewings, mind you - I realized: this was made by people who love zombie movies as much as I do. Now, the intervening years may have diminished my zombie adoration, but I still love this film. It takes what most of the cast had been doing on the BBC show Spaced (particularly the ""Art"" episode) and truly takes it to the next level.<br/><br/>Shaun works in an electronics store (named for Dawn of the Dead star Ken Foree) with a really bad life, to be honest. He has family issues, girlfriend issues, roommate issues, work issues - man, he has issues. When he wakes up to a zombie apocalypse, however, he finally finds purpose in life.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple, but the film is anything but. I've always been struck by how much emotion this wrings out - Shaun finally connecting with his stepfather Phillip (the always great Bill Nighy) moments before he dies and comes back from the dead, the final talk between our hero and his mother, and how the ending keeps status quo while allowing Shaun to claim a new life alongside the woman he loves.<br/><br/>No less of a zombie luminary than George Romero loved this movie. In fact, he invited Pegg and Wright to appear in 2005's Land of the Dead. However, the duo insisted on being zombies rather than the human roles they were offered.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film is when Shaun and his friend (potentially ex-girlfriend) Yvonne and her friends as they're both on the run. Beyond their friends being mirror images of one another, they're also famous British couples: Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes were Tim and Daisy from Spaced; Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman were Dawn and Tim from the British version of The Office; Dylan Moran and Tamsin Greig were Bernard and Fran from Black Books; Julia Deakin and Nick Frost were also in Spaced.<br/><br/>There are a ton of zombie movie references here, like an Italian place named Fulci's; the Winchester bar having a Winchester model 66, the same gun from Night of the Living Dead; a restaurant named Bub's Pizza after Bub from Day of the Dead; an employee named Ash is mentioned in Shaun's speech in the beginning, referencing Evil Dead; the song on the bus is ""Kernkraft 400"" by Zombie Nation; plus there's debate as to what to call the zombies, as many modern films refer to them as infected instead of the actual word. And of course, Ed shouting ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" comes directly from the movie that this all comes from, Night of the Living Dead.<br/><br/>Even though this film is nearly 15 years old, it hasn't aged in my eyes. But I'm biased - I loved Spaced, as well as the two films that follow this, Hot Fuzz and The World's End. Even if you don't love gore and zombies, there is still plenty of heart that you'll enjoy in this film."

","In Shaun of the Dead, it goes through 2 days of Shaun Riley's (Simon Pegg) mundane life. Going to work at Foree Electric, visiting his mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and his step-dad Philip (Bill Nighy), spending time with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), his best friend Ed (Nick Frost), and Liz's friends David (Dylan Morgan) and Dianne (Lucy Davis) all at once at the Winchester. This all changes one day when zombies walk the earth, not that Shaun notices at first. But once he notices, he's determined to save Liz and his mother by fighting off the zombie hordes as best as he can. Throughout this film, he finally grows up and accepts responsibility for his actions and learns to deal with problems on his own.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, Shaun consistently shows that he has no experience accepting responsibility. Whether it's taking Liz on a date, spending entire nights at the local pub the Winchester, or refusing to accept his step-father as his real dad now, Shaun never grows up. Before the zombies arrive, we slowly learn that he has never changed and most likely never will.<br/><br/>Once the zombies arrive, however, Shaun has to take on responsibility. In this life or death situation, he's the only one who will take charge and try to save his friends. This is similar to another Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright movie, The World's End, where Simon Pegg's character, Gary King, has to realize that there's more to do beyond drinking and that he has to stand up to an evil force to save his friends' lives. He chooses to fight them rather than give in and be forced to be their slaves. Throughout Shaun of the Dead, he has to make more and more important life choices, deciding between risking himself and saving others, he has to learn to grow up for once in his life, to make decisions and be ready to face the consequences. When it comes down to it, Shaun makes decisions that are questionable, but he learns to live with them and think critically about what to do, something he has never done before.<br/><br/>Lighting is a large part of the film as it represents the fear Shaun is experiencing during the scene, yet he decides to face that fear to be able to save his friends. The darkest scenes in terms of lighting are almost always in scenes where Shaun has to make a terrible choice, such as killing his mother or deciding to leave Ed behind to be eaten by zombies so he can escape. A repeated element always brought to light in the film is the color red. While this obviously shows up a lot because of the blood from the zombies, it also leaks from his pen and is prominent while he is at work. The color foreshadows what is to come and that there will be much more red in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, Shaun of the Dead is a simple story about a man who learns to grow up while fighting zombies, forcing him to learn how to deal with an adult life and accept some responsibility."

It will have them rolling on the floor one moment before wiping away a genuine tear the next.

"shannen-l-c","9","0","1","17 February 2018"," A legend of a movie in a genre that has some of the worst movies to ever be made
","'Shaun of the Dead' is an absolute classic. I'm reviewing this movie as someone who has seen it at best 10 times, if not more, over the years and that should be proof of how good it actually is. <br/><br/>Admittedly, this movie is much more appealing to a British audience since the British culture and humour may be difficult to understand or unfunny to non-Brits. But for those that do get its wittiness and dark sense of humour, it's hilarious and unforgettable. <br/><br/>As a horror fan, zombies and comedies are probably my two least favourite sub-genres, yet 'Shaun of the Dead' manages to combine the two in the most brilliant way. The humour is consistent with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost being the perfect comedic duo to play best friends, Shaun and Ed. It's clear to see that the two have a friendship off-screen that transitions onto screen and provides a very endearing and funny dynamic between them. <br/><br/>With most comedy horrors, the humour falls flat for me, but in Shaun of the Dead, despite it being delivered in many forms, it's always effective. There's the traditional slapstick comedy with the tripping, falling, funny faces (Simon Pegg's excels in this), there's comedy in the disaster of the character's and their numerous failings, the dialogue is dripping with snappy one-liners that are subtle but funny and there's even humour in the repetitiveness and mundane nature of their lives which continues even amidst a zombie apocalypse. There's the irony with lines such as ""You're dead"" and play-ons/foreshadowing of events to come with lines such as, ""You've got red on you"" and the opening scene with everybody going about their lives like zombies. These kind of subtleties are really what make the movie so genius. <br/><br/>Despite the comedic nature, there's also very serious scenes interwoven that evoke emotion and lead to reflection. Although fun is poked at the mess Shaun's life has become and death, it knows when to draw the line and take a step back from the humour. Surprisingly, the cast are just as capable of pulling off the more emotional scenes as they are the funny ones and towards the end there are some very heavy scenes that serve as a reminder that for the characters they're very much living through this hell. <br/><br/>What makes 'Shaun of the Dead' so brilliant is that you can see every single detail from beginning to end has been well thought out and meticulously planned. The ending beckons back to the beginning and throughout there are running gags or recurring themes or pieces of dialogue that really define the movie and make it distinctive. The plot and events are foreshadowed or prophesied from the very beginning and everything comes together in a very cohesive way. <br/><br/>In my opinion, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a classic in the horror-comedy genre that, although may not be everyone's cup of tea, has the perfect balance of comedy, emotion and gore supported by a brilliant cast."

","Waking up one seemingly normal morning, an aimless slacker and his best friend find their London suburb overrun by flesh-eating zombies raised through unknown means forcing him and his friends to gather together and get them to safety away from the deadly creatures.<br/><br/>This turned out to be one of the most enjoyable zombie efforts ever. Among the numerous positives here is the absolutely hilarious and gut-busting comedy that comes from several really funny sources, giving this some rather varied sources of comedy. While there are some hysterical physical gags when they stumble over things, trip-and-fall or just get bashed with objects all over the body, there's a great deal of wordplay throughout that leaves this incredibly humorous especially with the way that a lot of these events are added alongside the absolutely clever manner this one undergoes towards lampooning and spoofing the genre. The early repetition of the two days where they replicate the same story only with the zombies approaching on the second day inconspicuously, the ability of the new-reporter to give them the abilities needed to save themselves with their reports and the utterly creative and hilarious method of imitating the zombies to cross a massive swarm preventing them from getting to safety which all tends to turn traditional zombie fare into rather respective jokes and gags. That is another enjoyable facet here where this one takes the whole manner of treating them so seriously that there's a great threat from the zombies where they're absolutely considered a deadly serious threat that isn't made out to be a singular joke, which makes this so fun by allowing these two factors to co-exist together quite easily. Along with these, the film also has a lot of fun here with the rather exciting and action-packed encounters with the zombies which are spread throughout here as there are some utterly fun situations ere, from their encounter in the garden debating what kind of vinyl records to use as ammunition, the rescue of his parents as well as retrieving his girlfriend from the zombie hordes, the absolutely crazy attacks as they attempt to get into the bar and the film's finale where they are under siege in the bar from the numerous zombie hordes breaking through the barricades into an overall extended, action-packed flurry of bloodshed, dynamic encounters and even a nice touch of pathos to make for some exemplary moments here. Together with the fantastic zombie makeup and great gore, these here are enough to give this one some really enjoyable elements here against the one lone flaw here. That comes from the rather lame way this one keeps pounding home his family strife, letting it run for far too long turning it into overkill. Otherwise, there's not much really wrong here.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Extreme Graphic Language."

The film through the perspective of Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, through his lackluster life that is beginning to fall apart while enduring an inevitable zombie apocalypse. This film is riddled with comedy and a proper splash of gore. The point of this film, other than pure laughter, is teaching the viewer to overcome obstacles, which in this extreme zombie laden movie hits spot on.<br/><br/>The director, Edgar Wright, is a comical genius delivering films such as ""Hot Fuzz,"" Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" and The World's End."" He provides lessons in his film aside from the comedy and despite the gore. This film is his first major picture and it hit the mark. The editing and music helped to keep viewers locked in on the important moments in the film. Overall, this movie is a must watch for viewers who enjoy a good comedy and gore."
"Bored_Dragon","7","0","1","12 January 2018"," Golden middle
","I'm reading reviews and trying to find golden middle with no success. Audience considers this movie either the best or the worst British movie of the year. British have an unusual and for the rest of us often incomprehensible sense of humor. If you're used to Hollywood this probably won't entertain you. I suppose that most of the lowest ratings came from USA. At the other hand, I think this movie is overrated and that most of the tens, that pulled it to an average of eight, came largely from Britain. From my point of view, this is solid movie for one watching. I wouldn't call it a comedy. It is horror adventure sprinkled with lots of humor, British humor that tries not to be too British, but to adapt to the wider audience. And in that attempt lies it's biggest issue. Also, it is very difficult to mix genres, especially if there's too many. Although this movie somewhat succeeds in that attempt it didn't quite shine. Still, we have to acknowledge this brave attempt to make something unusual. All together, if you're not a fan of recent British film don't even give it a try, but if you are able to slip into British state of mind I think you'll enjoy this flick. I surely did.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Shaun of the Dead is one of only a handful of films, where no matter how far it is into its runtime, if I see it on TV i'll stop what i'm doing and watch it until its credits. This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and one that gets better upon repeat viewings. It's an Incredibly fun film that is endlessly quotable. Edgar Wright directs this film with a high level of energy and stylish panache. Shaun of the Dead has one of the best scripts written for a comedy, it rivals classics like Young Frankenstein, it's one of the most thought out, intelligent genre comedies around.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays your average every-man Shaun. Shaun is lazy, carefree and floating through life like a figurative zombie. He's some-one that's constantly taking the easy option, much to the annoyance of his girlfriend Liz(Kate Ashfield). So when a Zombie outbreak occurs, Shaun and his equally oafish roommate Ed(Nick Frost) are completely oblivious to the chaos encompassing them.<br/><br/>This leads to some truly hilarious situations such-as when Shaun is walking to his local convince store. He's completely disconnected on his everyday route to the local convenience shop, he Ignores a crashed car, a woman running away, an approaching zombie that he assumes is a beggar wanting change. Even when he slips on a pool of blood he's not attune to his surroundings. Being an Edgar Wright film, there are tons of visual gags and Easter eggs that accompany the situation, and the film as a whole. This makes re-watching the film just as fun and engaging as the first time, if not more-so.<br/><br/>There's even interesting social commentary to be gained from the film as- well. Much like George A. Romero's Dead trilogy it looks at how oblivious society has become, and how mundane our daily lives are, that not only does a Zombie apocalypse come and go without any notice being taken, but also how much real people act like Zombies, doing the same jobs and tasks day after day, becoming increasingly disconnected with society and each other. Whilst this aspect is explored in greater detail in Romero's Dead films, there's still a healthy serving of satire in this film to be gained. The fact that Wright can extract gags from some of the most mundane scenarios like a pen leaking on a shirt is a testament to his wonderfully creative writing and directing skills.<br/><br/>However once Shaun and Ed come to realise the situation they're in, the film really kicks Into gear. After Shaun and Ed fend off an assault from two zombies in hysterical fashion, by sorting through their un-wanted vinyl records, and trying to lob them at their heads. Though when that failed they have to resort to a spade and a cricket bat. They then devise a plan to take Shaun's mum and his girlfriend Liz as-well as her two roommates, and hide-out at their local pub. In Shaun's words ""Go to the Winchester, have a pint, and wait for all this to blow over.""<br/><br/>Naturally during the course of the film things don't go smoothly, and despite being a comedy, it is after all a Zombie film. There are moments with lots of gore, as-well as brilliantly timed Zombie kills to the beat of Queens - Don't Stop Me Now. Shaun of the Dead manages to converge these two tones, and deliver one of the best genre mash ups of all-time.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead was my first exposure to the Incredible talent that is Edgar Wright. His writing and directing, and especially the way his films are edited to the beat of a drum show how confident and creative of a director that he is. Despite this being his debut film(no i'm not counting A Fistful of Fingers), he is like a puppet master that is in full control of every frame. I can't find a bad word to say about Shaun of the Dead, for me this Is the pinnacle of comedic film-making."
"iollann","9","0","2","2 April 2017"," Review-Shaun of the Dead
","Review: Shaun of the Dead 'Shaun of the dead' directed by Edgar Wright is a loose parody of 'Dawn of the Dead' although the similarities are just the name and the zombies. It is the first film of the cornetto trilogy starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. It is a zombie, comedy-horror, romance film and is in my opinion the best of the cornetto trilogy films. Released in 2004 it is about a man who decides to turn his life around and get back with his ex-girlfriend, reconciling with his mam and dealing with an entire community which has turned into zombies. Shaun, played by Simon peg, is a pretty average person. He works in a television sales shop. One day he decides to win his ex-back, and make up with his mam and his step-dad all the while a zombie apocalypse is going on. One thing this film does well is it picks and chooses what type of genre it want to be in different scenes. One minute its horror than its comedy, then drama, then a bit of romance and sometimes a mix of all. That's what this film does best and what makes it so good. One of the standout scenes in the whole film is when Shaun walks to the shop for the second time. The first time he goes at the start of the film it cements what a loser he is but the second time it is pretty funny. He groggily walks to the shop and as he's just out of bed he's not fully awake and doesn't notice what is happening around him. Zombies are all around him and he hasn't a clue, it is hilarious. It is a very well shot scene and sets up the humour side of the film. What I liked about this film as well is that it had a relatively low budget and the special effects still hold up today. The goriest scene in the film is when a man is ripped apart and it holds up today. There is no CGI used and I appreciate that. The practical effects are spot on. Another great thing about the cornetto trilogy, not just Shaun of the dead, is the relationship on screen between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They work very well together, playing off one another. The script is very funny and well written by Edgar Right and Simon Pegg. The camaraderie between characters especially Shaun and Ed. Also with their other housemate Pete. Finally the ending is very funny and without giving too much away I could see the commercialization of zombies if there ever was an apocalypse. In conclusion 'Shaun of the Dead' is a very well written, exciting, witty, gory, fun film. The acting, writing and visuals are great. If you liked it I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing the rest of the collaborations between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. All in all I give it a 9/10. It's a must see."
"robinbdevlin","8","0","4","11 April 2015"," a modern classic
","Billed as a romantic comedy with zombies Shaun of the dead is a smart, funny British comedy starring geek icons Simon Pegg and Nick frost. The first part in the 'Blood and Ice Cream' trilogy, (the spiritual successors being Hot Fuzz and The Worlds End) the story concerns the titular Shaun who is every bit the everyman hero, he likes to spend his evenings in his local pub, the Winchester, with his best mate Ed and his girlfriend Liz unfortunately Liz wants more from life and dumps our hero then one drunken night he decides that he is going to get his life back on track, unfortunately for Shaun, the dead start to rise from their graves. So we have a sharply written relationship comedy against the backdrop of a full on zombie infestation. The jokes are good and the action sequences have a gritty feeling that they are routed in realism rather than overblown Hollywood shtick. The film lovingly references such grates as dawn of the dead and night of the living dead but the references are all subtle, blink-and-you'll-miss-it ones like The rifle they use in the Winchester is, naturally, a Winchester model 73 the same weapon used in both versions of 'Night of the Living Dead' and During the scene in which Ed (Nick Frost) yells into the phone, ""We're coming to get you, Barbara,"" is a direct lift from Night of the Living Dead (1968) it's a film that has aged well, the effects still look current and by keeping pop cutler references so subtle it doesn't feel like a film that is eleven years old, part of the reason it still looks good is that they used real squibs rather than digital ones. Real blood squibs always look better. You actually care about Shaun and his life, despite the fact that on the surface he is such a loser, it feels like he is a real person and not a tired caricature of a loser. Even the ridiculous setting, a zombie epidemic, feels real and the way that the characters react to the situation are realistic there's no silly out of character moments and the whole movie flows wonderfully, it's a cliché to call it a non-stop-thrill-ride but it is, simply a well-made, well shot and well written film that keeps throwing jokes, awesome character pieces and even the odd heart breaking moment at you. In short the film dose everything right and very little wrong, if I had to find fault with the film it would be that some of the jokes are a bit subtle on the first viewing, but that is hardly a fault as the more times you watch the film the more you will get from it."
"Lejink","8","0","4","8 April 2015"," Dead men and women walking.
","Very funny Pegg and Frost vehicle spoofing zombie films actually quite a long time before the whole ""Twilight"" thing got underway not to mention the sub-genre of historical characters like Abraham Lincoln combating the undead when not fighting a civil war and abolishing slavery.<br/><br/>If anything, I found there were probably too many zombies on display leading to lots of time taken up battering, skewering and shooting hordes of them, which to my mind got in the way a little of the very funny humour elsewhere. Sure Frost and Pegg are just another set of men behaving badly, Frost the lazy, slobbish leech and Pegg the bright, blokey nerd but they play off each other so well that I'll forgive the stereotypes.<br/><br/>The gags come thick and fast, with running-gags a-plenty (""You've got red on you"", ""I'm sorry, Shaun"" and more), sight and slapstick-gags and lots of local humour to relate to, especially if you're born in the UK. I found very few of the jokes obviously telegraphed, instead finding the humour and general observation both fresh and funny. My favourite gag, probably the deciding of which records to aim at the zombies - ""Purple Rain"" - No, ""Sign Of The Times"" - definitely not, ""Batman"" soundtrack - send it!<br/><br/>Director Edgar Wright does so briskly, especially with those now familiar fast-cut edits to speed along a scene or a joke. There's good support by all, but principally from Bill Nighy as Shaun's stand-offish step-dad and Lucy Smith as Shaun's girlfriend's girl-friend.<br/><br/>All in all, just a very funny, if fake-gore-loving comedy, which rather like the zombies in the movie, I'd happily jump back up again to re-watch any future chance I get."
"bowmanblue","9","0","3","7 February 2015"," The 'Cornetto Trilogy' Part I
","Many a film – and in particular zombie film – seems to be based on a pun ('Flight of the Living Dead' I'm looking at you). However, few actually exhibit enough originality to be worthy of the film they're based on. 'Shaun' changes all that. In 2004 zombies were still relatively uncommon on the cinema screen. You had the 'Resident Evil' films and that was about it. Therefore, being dumped by one's girlfriend on the same day the dead come back to life and start eating the living, was definitely something a bit different back then.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that 'Shaun of the Dead' is a classic. Since its release it's been imitated plenty of times and none of them have really done as well. The fact is that 'Shaun' is just damn funny, while at the same time being pretty horrific when it tries and even touching and sentimental when the mood takes it. Therefore, despite largely being lumped into the 'horror' genre, its appeal actually stretches much further to those looking for a good comedy, or even a 'date movie' to share with someone.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg plays not exactly a loser, but certainly an underachiever. His titular character, Shaun, is generally coasting through life, never really applying himself. All he wants to do is hang out at the local pub with his mate, Ed (who definitely IS a loser!). It's no wonder his girlfriend, Liz, is getting more than a little sick of his lack of drive. However, that all changes when the dead rise from the grave and he hatches a plan to save those he loves (and even a few of those he doesn't – Liz's flatmate to be precise).<br/><br/>What follows is a jaunt across a zombie-infested London as they desperately try to get to safety. And, in Shaun's mind 'safety' equals the local pub where he spends pretty much all his life. What works best about the film is the way the characters play off each other. They're pretty much all friends in real life (check out some of the other films and TV they've been in), therefore they're all used to working with each other and, more importantly, playing off each other. You really get the impression that they really are a bunch of friends, caught up in a life or death situation.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you like horror, you'll like this. If you like comedy, you'll still like it. And, in case you're wondering what the 'cornetto' reference is in the title – this happens to be the first film in the fabled 'cornetto trilogy.' Simon Pegg wrote the film with his friend (and director) Edgar Wright. Together they wrote a further two films, all subtly working in a nice ice cream into the mix. If you like Shaun of the Dead, try 'Hot Fuzz' (comedy and action) and 'The World's End' (comedy and sci-fi), all the time watching out for the cornetto reference."
"Lucabrasisleeps","7","0","2","17 January 2015"," Much more Comedy than horror
","This is one movie which mixes two genres which I don't like - horror comedy and zombie. But where it succeeds is the fact that horror is not really a factor in this. It is not really a horror comedy, it is just a straight forward comedy. That makes it better than the numerous ridiculous horror comedies that are coming out every year from the USA (Which has patented the genre I think). <br/><br/>Don't expect any sort of suspense or creepy moments in this one. But the movie is so full of action, it doesn't really matter. Certain characters were a little annoying for me especially David who was getting on my nerves a bit. I don't think Ed was too likable either, he created more problems, with his impressive size he could have been a useful asset to the group.<br/><br/>The movie takes its time to get going and spends time in establishing the characters and the situations. But once it gets into gear, it really doesn't let up till the end. There were quite a few ridiculous moments and obviously many zombie movie conventions were made fun of. Including the use (or misuse) of guns. If you actually think about it, zombies are not as big a threat in small numbers (because they move slow and are not intelligent). I guess their advantage is that nobody believes in zombies and they spring upon you without any warning. And by the time, everybody realizes that zombies exist, many people are already infected. <br/><br/>It helps to watch the movie with subtitles because the funny lines are spit out quick and with the accent, it was slightly hard. One of the best scenes was the one where they were throwing the records at the zombies, the dialogue is pretty funny in that scene! It has a light tone throughout and that is reflected in the ending as well. <br/><br/>As of now, this is my favourite zombie themed film. I preferred this movie to Hot Fuzz (I got a headache watching that film). So I guess it may be a good decision to check out The World's End as well.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Shaun of the dead has some great cemical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. This film should be seen side by side with Romero's ""Dawn of the dead"" as both film cleverly and sarcastically comment on our zombie society and virtually show no difference between the living and the living dead. Of course, not everything goes as smoothly as planned. There's undead flatmates to deal with,""bitoy"" zombies along the way, petty arguments between friends and Ed's cell phone going off at inopportune moments.

"brchthethird","7","0","2","14 November 2014"," Solid first feature from Pegg, Frost and Wright
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a smart, funny homage to zombie movies while also maintaining its own identity instead of relying entirely on genre clichés. This film marked the first theatrical collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright and is a mostly solid affair. The performances and directing are all handled well, but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I was expecting. Maybe it's because British humor isn't something I 100% get. Still, I thought that the gore was well-done, tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that I cared what happened to them. For me, the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horror-comedy. Overall, it's one of the better horror-comedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","2","5 November 2014"," A romantic comedy with zombies
","Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a British horror-comedy inspired in part by zombie movies like George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"". The story surrounds a pair of twenty-something underachievers who find themselves in the middle of a zombie crisis. For the titular Shaun the situation becomes a catalyst for getting his life back on track.<br/><br/>One of the things that I really appreciated about this movie in the early going was the deft juxtaposition of comedy and horror. The title character has an inkling that something odd is going on but things have already progressed quite a bit before he finally gets wise. The direction is particularly interesting during this stage because we see several stock horror shots recycled in a clever way.<br/><br/>Comedy is just one of the weapons in the film's arsenal, though. When things start getting horrific there are some tense moments, though still tempered with a sense of humour. The film also has some surprisingly heartfelt emotional content as well. Clearly the brains behind the script were much more thoughtful than most horror writers.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, Wright co-wrote the script with star Simon Pegg. Pegg's performance in the lead role propels the film and his pairing with Nick Frost provides many of the film's finest comedic moments. Meanwhile, Bill Nighy makes a welcome appearance in a small role and the remainder of the core group of supporting players complements the central pair nicely.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a film that should be essential viewing for both horror and comedy fans since it's not too scary to be funny and it's not too funny to be scary. And if you're wondering how gory the film is, it's not bad. Granted, there is one scene where a fellow gets ripped limb from limb but apart from that it's fairly tame."

","At least here in Britain this film is seen as a coming of age film, meaning if you haven't seen this film you can't really comment on zombie films. This film sees Shaun a guy contempt with his boring average life going to the pub with his beat friend ed. However, when a zombie apocalypse hits town Shaun, ed and a few others must attempt to survive in their favourite pub the Winchester. Now I believe Simon pegg is a great comedic actor and in this film he truly proves it, he is the perfect person to play Shaun. He is funny, he is relatable and sometimes heroic and exactly what a film like this truly needs. Nick frost is hear as usual as his best friend ed and he also does a really good job, obviously the chemistry between pegg and frost is insane and it truly carries the film. I thought the actress who played Shaun's girlfriend did a good job as well with some really good dialogue, but the rest of the characters were pretty paper thin and not interesting at all. Now this is your typical zombie apocalypse, but, it does have a good story of a character who is down and average rise up and become a hero and I liked it a lot. Also I liked the way that the story made out that the zombies represent every day life and that was a good stylistic option. There is some plot points just shoehorned into the film but I forgave this because of the overall story with Shaun. The script is just excellent with the dialogue being really quick and snappy and also the jokes didn't feel forced and they flowed incredibly well into the narrative where there was a few heartfelt moments. Obviously to me the style is really cool as the film is completely British and I liked the setting and also the way the zombies acted was cool. Overall I think Shaun of the dead is fantastic and it should be seen by all."

And yet every moment of it is funny. For example, there is a scene where Shaun and his gang move through a street full of zombies by pretending to be one of them. It is a cheeky idea and it is fun to watch them do that, but the danger of being discovered is kept real.<br/><br/>Pegg is the life of the movie.

","Most likely, but they can't deliver a punchline to save their lives. I enjoyed this movie, but it's no Oscar contender. This was my first Simon Pegg movie if you don't count the Star Trek films. Pitting two losers against the zombie apocalypse was an enjoyable premise and they pulled if off pretty well. This isn't an ""end of the world"" kind of zombie film, more a ""there goes the neighborhood"" type that changes the character's lives, but doesn't have any real world impact at the end. The zombies were nearly ""Walking Dead"" caliber in realism. Got a little serious at the end (but it's death, after all). Could've been a lot funnier if I was drinking, but overall a fun film. Perhaps a light second act sandwiched between ""28 Days Later"" and ""28 Weeks Later"" in a zombie marathon."

A couple of years before that Danny Boyle scared audiences in England with his successful zombie flick 28 Days Later. Shaun of the Dead works as a spoof to all zombie movies so the distributors had perfect timing which is essential for a comedy. The film also had a pretty strong fan base considering Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had worked with director Edgar Wright in the past in the TV series Spaced. The setting for this film was just perfect and Wright and Pegg did a great job with the script. Thanks to Shaun of the Dead we got to see these actors team up together for another great film: Hot Fuzz (a spoof on pretty much all the 90's action movies) and for the upcoming The World's End which is receiving great reviews from critics. Fans of the TV series Spaced might enjoy some inside references in Shaun of the Dead, but regardless of whether or not you've seen it you will still have a great time with this film because the script is witty and clever while the performances are also all pretty strong. The more zombie movies you've seen the more you will enjoy this because it makes fun of several of those generic stereotypes. I wouldn't say this is a horror flick because there isn't really a scary moment, but it is an intelligent comedy that makes fun of those cheesy moments in horror films (jump scenes where one person shows up all of a sudden with creepy music in the background). Shaun of the Dead is worth your time if you are looking for a good and fun time.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is kind of a slacker who hasn't done much with his life. He is content to spend his days with his roommate Ed (Nick Frost) and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) hanging out at the local pub where he is a frequent customer. The problem is that Liz is tired of the relationship since all they do is hang out with Ed at the pub and she barely gets to have time alone with him. Shaun promises to take her out to a nice restaurant and turn his life around, but the next day he gets distracted by a visit from his stepdad (Bill Nighy) who reminds him he has to go visit his mother (Penelope Wilton) thus forgetting to reserve a table for dinner with his girlfriend. Tired of Shaun's broken promises, Liz decides to break up with him. Shaun realizes it's time to turn his life around, but something strange is happening in his town. All of a sudden dead people are coming back to life and attacking everyone so Shaun realizes this is the perfect opportunity to prove to Liz that he is capable of saving and protecting her from the deadly zombie attacks.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead works really well thanks to the great chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; you can tell their friendship transcends the big screen and seeing them pair up is what works best in this film. The British gags and cultural references cross borders and the jokes are effective anywhere. This is one film anyone can enjoy because it works on its own. It isn't one of those spoof films which you can only enjoy if you've seen the movie it's making fun of. The fun and the jokes work on their own and the relationship between the characters is also really strong. Shaun of the Dead came to my attention when Quentin Tarantino shared his list of the 20 best films of the last 20 years and this movie appeared on that list. I really enjoyed this movie, but I don't consider it among the best comedies of our era. In my opinion Hot Fuzz was even funnier, but I really look forward to The World's End which looks really promising. Shaun of the Dead is worth checking out if you are one of the few people that haven't seen it."

","Shaun of the Dead is a brilliant movie with a fantastic storyline and a surprisingly impressive comedic cast.It is Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's first movie and they give a very good first impression,their characters were both hilarious in this movie and they were also very impressive as actors.I was also very impressed with Lucy Davis,I didn't think she would be able to deliver a performance like she did in this,because I only knew her from the Office.The movie is said to be a romantic horror comedy,but I would only count it as a comedy,the zombies are more funny than scary and the romance isn't very intense,its more comedic.Fans of British comedies like Spaced,will definitely love Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>When his town has turned into zombies,Shaun (Simon Pegg) does his best to protect his ex-girlfriend,his mother and his best friend,while trying to make it to his favourite pub."
"tiffanyhepworth1998","9","0","1","7 July 2013"," It's an amazing comedy!
","Well for starters Simon Pegg is an amazing actor which makes the film even better, and their all very realistic actors. I love the story line and the way it is directored, and seriously you haven't lived until you have watched this film! The way the characters act towards the situation is very realistic, just like how normal everyday people would act if this actually happened. It is a great comedy, the acting, the speech and the body language are very funny in places and very amusing. The fact that it's on the news makes it feel like it's real life, and people's immediate reaction in that situation, they act like they cant believe what's happening, but there's also a funny side to everything that happens. I would recommend anybody (if you're into zombie films) to watch this unique film, it is thought through well and every actor and actress has put all their effort and thoughts into it."

","Back in 2004, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright gave us a zombie classic, Shaun of the Dead. It was a different pace than other recent zombie flicks (Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later), as it was a comedy. Pegg, a well known British actor (Spaced, many British Television shows) and Wright, a writer director whose first big hit would be this.<br/><br/>And they deliver.<br/><br/>Shaun is a furniture salesmen who participates in the same boring schedule everyday. He has problems with his mother (Penelope Wilton) and his girlfriend (Kate Ashfield). He is thrust into the zombie apocalypse, and needs to band together with his best friend Ed (Nick Frost), Liz (his girlfriend), his mother, and his girlfriend's flat-mates in order to make it to their favourite place in the world, the Winchester pub, in hopes of waiting the whole thing off.<br/><br/>This is Pegg and Wright's first film together, and their script is very witty and humorous, but knows where it stands as a zombie film. It's a completely different take on the zombie apocalypse, showing that even if the entire world is falling apart, you can still drink and laugh to your heart's content.<br/><br/>The duo's first crack at a film together is astounding, and spawned the ""Blood and Ice Cream"" or ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy, which also contains Hot Fuzz and the upcoming film The World's End.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is a truly wonderful film, giving great performances, laughs and zombie slaughtering throughout,and it shows us the meaning of friendship, family, and that you need to ""remove the head or destroy the brain"" in order to survive.<br/><br/>Everyone should experience this film at one time or another, I know I will be experiencing it again soon.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The other day I watched this all the way through for the first time in a while. Nonstop throwback horror movie references and plenty of in-jokes make this one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. <br/><br/>Wrights style is great. I LOVE the use of jump cuts and quick zooms to almost mock the ""jump scare"" tactic of normal ""horror"" or ""zombie"" films. Its a style he would go on to perfect in Hot Fuzz and the soon to be released trilogy ending ""The Worlds End"". <br/><br/>The film is acted perfectly by Pegg and Frost (as well as the smaller roles, especially those played by Nighy, Penelope Wilton and Dylan Moran). I think the only thing bad I could pick out was the pace. I think around the late 2nd/early 3rd act, the film starts to drag a bit. Other than that though, a fantastic comedy, with plenty of brains, and plenty of zombies to eat them."

","What a brilliant film, I thought it was great. The great mix of comedy, horror and over the top gore filled me with joy. The casting is great. Simon Pegg: always great. Nick Frost: adds lightheartedness to a serious film. Bill Nighy: although his part was small every line he said sounded like genius and they all made me chuckle. It all seems to work; when you look closely you can spot things (characters, places) that appear later on in the film. Some parts of this film will have you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails but then you'll find that in the next minute you'll be laughing at a funny comment that one of the hilarious actors has blurted out. A must see for people who like action, being scared, laughing your head off and don't mind an extortionate amount of strong language."
"seanwilliams95","9","0","2","2 December 2012"," Bleedin' epic!
","Definitely one of the greatest comedy films out there as well as a brilliant representation of an undead outbreak in London made by two of the best British film-making minds out there; Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. Shaun of the Dead with it's witty humour and clever use of horror it appeals to an audience after an alternative take on the comedy genre.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best film ever... just kidding, of course I would! It provides a good laugh with a mixture of drama between Shaun, Liz and other characters while allowing the audience to connect with these characters and watch them in their most vulnerable state; a world surrounded in death and violence, where losing your loved ones becomes virtually inevitable - a surprisingly difficult role to act out while maintaining hilarity in the events. Shaun of the Dead shows American film makers that the British know a thing or two as well, and I'm certainly one for disproving American beliefs about us!<br/><br/>To summarise, watch this film, it's bloody good!"
"MattyGibbs","10","0","2","14 November 2012"," Brilliant
","A truly brilliant horror-comedy which gets it right on every level. Both funny, touching and with plenty of horror moments, this film has it all.<br/><br/>The film boasts an excellent British cast with stand-out performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as the main protagonists and Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy as Shauns mom and step dad.<br/><br/>The film boasts several memorable scenes but in truth barely a scene is wasted. The true test of a film is whether it repays repeated viewings and on this point the film really excels. I have seen this film on a number of occasions and pick up something new each time.<br/><br/>The film is very British and the extreme bad language throughout may put some people off and the ending could have been slightly stronger but other than that, I really cannot fault this film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"bluejacquet","6","0","1","9 July 2012"," A decent enough of a movie - worth a watch
","Shaun of the Dead. Hmm... where to begin. Well, it is a horror movie spoof - of the zombie sort - with clever comedic moments and a solid storyline/plot. It's not very scary at all.<br/><br/>Shaun is a decent guy that you want to root for. His buddy Ed is an idiot so you end up liking him, too. Shaun's romantic interest, Liz, is a good gal as well so you end up rooting for her. Finally, this is a love story, and, as a viewer, you want the 3-year love affair between Shaun and Liz to work out (their relationship is on the fritz).<br/><br/>So, all-in-all, I'd say give this movie a shot. There's comedy, likable characters, love, and a few zombies to boot."
"Tweekums","8","0","2","16 February 2012"," Plenty of laughs and a fair amount of gore
","Having enjoyed the television series 'Spaced' I was keen to see this film as it features many of the same creators. Here Simon Pegg plays the eponymous Shaun, a salesman in a dead end job who lives with his best mate Ed who just lazes around playing video games all day before spending the evenings down the pub with Shaun, Shaun's girlfriend Liz and her friends Dianne and David. His life is so mundane that he doesn't notice that the streets are slowly filling with the walking dead. When he finally does notice he decides that he and Ed must go and rescue his mother and his now ex-girlfriend and seek sanctuary in The Winchester. Things are complicated by the fact that his step father has been bitten and the area around the pub is crawling with the living dead! <br/><br/>While this is primarily a comedy there should be enough gore to please horror fans; in fact I suspect they will enjoy the comedy more too as they will spot references that those not familiar with the classics of the zombie genre, like me, will miss. The story is pretty basic but that doesn't matter; extra subplots would just have been a distraction. The acting was pretty solid; Simon Pegg was ideal as Shaun and Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy were great as his mother and step father; both providing some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this type. There is a fair amount of gore; once or twice things get extremely gory however it isn't really dwelt on too much. Fans of 'Spaced' will be pleased to see Jessica Hynes even though her role is much smaller here. If you are in the mood for a horror film but also want a good laugh then this could be just the film you are looking for."

","I will be very short with this zombedy. The way it was edited was really well done, the zombies looked believable. The acting was okay and the humor in it was excellent. I did have a few loud laughs. Just watch how they used Don't Stop Me Now from Queen when they are hitting a zombie. Or when they meet another bunch of people that have survived. Or when Shaun is walking towards a shop. It's also funny to see how Coldplay was involved in this project, back then in 2004 they weren't the mega seller they are nowadays. The effects on the other hand were excellent, just see how one zombie got a whole in her stomach. <br/><br/>And not only the humor was okay but the gore staid intact too. There are a few better comedies out there but this one worked on all kind, script, make-up, effects and especially the editing. The two main leads (nick Frost and Simon Pegg) went further as the Thomson twins in Tintin by Steven Spielberg. <br/><br/>Surely on to see if you want to have some fun.<br/><br/>Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 3/5"

","So I had seen Shaun of the Dead before...but it was always scattered scenes of it. Today I finally saw it in its entirety and it is a very funny film. The satire in it is great, and the way the 'Dead' is not just referring to the obvious zombies but also to the world Shaun himself lived in is great. I do feel that it becomes a little tired in its last act, and I do think Zombieland is the better comedy zombie film. However this has the better performances and the character of Ed is always pretty damn entertaining. I just wish the film hadn't lost the same spark it had in the beginning. Overall, it's very funny and definitely recommended for horror fans (and anyone at that)."
"robert-temple-1","Null","0","1","18 August 2011"," Hilarious anarchy, the Marx Brothers meet Val Lewton
","This is a wild film, which carries comedy into realms of anarchy hitherto undreamed-of. The humour is very British, and many of the characters are 'slobs' of a type only found in Britain. It is not that other countries do not have slobs, but British slobs are strangely different from, say, American slobs. This film sheds a great deal of light on slobology, and the variants of slobs which occur in Britain, which have never been the subject of sufficient academic study. One would think that the armies of sociologists marching into a Glorious Future intended to be ruled by automaton-like regulators who will determine our every move in our daily lives would have turned their attentions towards slobology, but this seems to have eluded them in their zeal to oppress people who are not slobs. Indeed, it is even possible that the sociologists and their disciples the social workers are themselves closet slobs who are afraid of coming out. But Simon Pegg is not afraid of coming out, indeed he is not afraid of anything, even crowds of murderous zombies. The film works because of the marvellous comic abilities of Simon Pegg, around whom the entire phantasmagoria of the story evolves. Much of the film takes place with the few sane slobs left in the country (Pegg and his girl friend) surrounded by hordes of dead people who have come back to life and wish to bite living people, infect them with their virus, and turn them into zombies like themselves. This film is thus a kind of insanely funny homage to the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956), the classic psychological horror film from which the world never recovered, and which touched the ultimate nerve of our insecurities. There is no way to purge fear better than by laughter, and mocking the zombies in this outrageous farce is a good way to lay them to rest, at least temporarily. There are deep psychological reasons why this film was so successful, which go beyond its anarchic humour and zestful production. Pegg is also an excellent Everyman, in that he is totally immune to recognition of his own faults, and who does that remind us of? Pegg is also not afraid to look ridiculous. All of us are ridiculous, but most of us do not wish to appear so. Pegg is thus a kind of miraculous super-slob, someone so clueless, but possessing an intermittent animal cunning, that he is echelons above the rest of us in both folly and survival capacity. He is thus very like a king's fool in a mediaeval royal court. As he wades calmly through seas of threatening zombies, batting them with his cricket bat and bashing in their skulls (the only way to destroy a zombie, so we are told by real-life British television presenters used in the film, is to destroy the brain which has been infected, for nothing else can kill them), Pegg is simultaneously heroic and idiotic. He is heroic without knowing it, because he fights his way through the zombies without fear, but he is an idiot because his only plan is to go to his favourite pub The Winchester and take refuge there with a pint of beer, imagining it must be safe from the zombies because that is where he always goes to relax and unwind. So the film is really a celebration of idiocy, done with good humour and affection. The real reason why Pegg does not feel fear is because he is too stupid to do so, and the closest he comes to fear is a state of mindless apprehension, and worry of the 'will I miss the train' sort. The film is thus, in its wider sense, a commentary on the whole of British society, which in a state of apprehension stopping far short of fear because of mass stupidity, is wading through the bankruptcies and financial contagion (another form of zombieism) towards economic doom and social collapse. Most British slobs depend on a mythical thing called 'the State' to support them. When 'the State' can no longer do so, and when the bail-outs inevitably come to an end, the slobs will then possibly become hordes of angry zombies thronging the streets, as we see in this film, and indeed as has just happened in all the riots in real life London, which included slobs as young as eleven. This film might thus be likened to the ancient Biblical prophets, in its warning that the zombies are coming, or the end of the world is nigh, or the end of Croydon is nigh, or whatever. But then, there is always The Winchester, and a couple of pints, to save us. The supporting cast and the direction of this film by Edgar Wright are all superb. The script by Pegg and Wright is brilliant. The film is a classic, not just a 'cult classic', but a real one. And anyone who doesn't agree can have his head bashed in by a cricket bat."

I was also glad that they kept the humour very British, because that's what I love most about them. I would stay away from this if you don't like excessive swearing (most Pegg and Frost films are like that anyway!) However, if it's blood and guts your worried about, don't be, it's all very comical and looks really fake. Overall I would say that Shaun of the Dead is a very funny film with good actors.

","I really, really like Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's films. I loved Hot Fuzz the first time i saw it, not as good second time but still. I had heard from many that Shaun of the Dead is actually even better and after finally seeing it I can say I agree. Not just better, Shaun of the dead is one of the best comedies I have seen in quite some time. It's both very smart done and brilliantly funny. It perfectly knows what to put the focus on. The story is nothing that really matters much, there is one but it serves only the purpose of holding it together. Still one never gets the feeling that it is to thin, because you quickly into it get the picture that the story is not what will hold this up. I love the kind of humor this film has but it's not jokes and that kind of fun. An example when some are sitting talking and all seems normal but then the camera slightly turns. Much of the humor works kind of like that first everything is normal and then quickly something unexpected and funny is revealed. Sometimes music is used brilliantly funny in the same way. The film is violent but not as much as Hot Fuzz where I felt it became a bit overdrawn. Here it's used just enough. Like the story it's always over the top, unrealistic and extremely funny to watch. Impressive how great characters they managed to create, this being a comedy and not that long. Shaun of the Dead is not just a comedy like others, well of course somethings are but this movie just makes every aspect massively better than the usual stuff. Just lean back and be just as entertained as impressed. Shaun of the Dead is brilliant and a pleasure to see."

","What do you get when you put the apocalypse, zombies and the chaotic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together? You get Shaun of the Dead, a marvelously crafted, written and acted comedy with everything thrown in: troublesome parental relations, a girlfriend who's drifting away, idiotic and exasperating friends and of course, a ton of zombies and Simon Pegg armed with a cricket bat to bash their heads in. Brilliantly written by both Pegg and Edgar Wright, it is the first and solid debut of three films that form the Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy (Hot Fuzz, the second film, is even more hilarious and a must-watch).<br/><br/>Pegg plays Shaun; 29-years-old, struggling to please his girlfriend and doesn't know what to do with his life. Frost plays his housemate, Ed, who is just well, crude. The two find themselves awaking one morning to find the apocalypse at their doorstep; or more specifically, too many zombies wandering in the streets trying to eat people up. Shaun teams up with his friends and parents and decides to do something about it, for once in his life. So begins the mass killing of zombies accompanied by the audience's laughter the entire journey.<br/><br/>This is a hilarious film and both Pegg and Wright have already established themselves among the best in comedic writing. Though there are those who don't find zombies as exciting, the humour is enough to give it a watch. The clever plays by the cast combined with the irresistible and gory bashing of zombies makes for a film that provides Shaun with a new focus and meaning in life. It doesn't quite contain deep and moral lessons for us, but it's entertaining, and that's all that matters."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","2","18 December 2010"," Convincing British effort, which is so much more than mere pastiche as it integrates class comedy and character study-alike rather well.
","Filmmakers and writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, in tandem, prove they're more than adept at producing a high on energy levels; high on laughs comedy material in their 2004 film Shaun of the Dead. Their film is a big on fun, big on smarts comedy-romance piece about a clash of classes and a man going through somewhat of a midlife crisis just as the end of the world, in the form of the dead coming back to life so as to feed on the living, arrives into the world. The film is a merciless series of rapid punchlines and in-jokes, entertaining and effective in equal measure without ever feigning to be anything more; a piece made by two people whom have here shown they have the comic timing and the subtly required to take on the kind of material they do. Take, for instance, the scene in which certain characters are trapped inside a locked car because the rear door child-locks are on. It was established five minutes ago that they were on, but such a gag works thanks largely to Wright and Pegg's ability to introduce something; place it on the back-burner and then execute the joke when required to around all the other stuff in the form of character, more immediate gags that are going on and great peril which is unfolding.<br/><br/>One casts one's mind back to David Zucker's 2003 film My Boss's Daughter; a comedy free freak show whose comic timing awkwardly consisted of someone, in Ashthon Kutcher, inept and cack-handed placed in the delicate situation of looking after a pristine home and charged with looking after the pride and joy of its owner in the form of a pet owl. The sounds of the gears of an automobile being incorrectly changed as it approaches a speed began to sound pretty early on, sure enough, everything goes down the pan in an as limp manner as possible in what was an excruciating feature. The team on Shaun of the Dead set a joke up; mix it in with a couple of others; have you momentarily misplace it before effortlessly executing the punch-line minutes later amidst everything else that's happening. In comparison, it is a bravado display of both comic timing on top of entertaining material. Another example might be the anger levels reached by one character, whose berating at others stems from the fact the front door is persistently being left open overnight; the gag of which is set up, placed on a back-burner and then pulled off with aplomb when the time comes.<br/><br/>It is Simon Pegg playing the titular Shaun, a man in his late twenties working in a high-street electronics store whilst supervising the more younger employees. He lives with part-time drug dealer but the generally unemployed Ed (Frost) and whom we're led to believe is a high-flying businessman in Pete (Serafinowicz), both of whom Shaun have known for many years. Shaun's relationship with Liz (Ashfield) is on the rocks, they sit in a public house named The Winchester with some of her friends and discuss where they stand. The pair of them clash in profile, Ed's more centralised figure as he works a slot machine and spouts one-liners distracting us from what Liz has to say. She wants more out of life and wants a better relationship with Shaun in which they do more together rather than just go to the pub. The parallel between their disfigured connection to that of David (Moran) and Dianne's (Davis), Liz's friends, relationship is clear in that their's is sturdier and have interests of a 'higher' nature such as the going to theatres. This is precisely where Liz wishes to be, in terms of status, with Shaun. The earlier clash in profile has David and Dianne sit on Liz's side, effectively a clashing of classes, as Shaun's accomplice Ed comes over and alienates everybody with his demeanour.<br/><br/>Shaun and Ed appear so tuned out of their lives that they appear to have missed the apocalypse. Two sequences that mirror one another show Shaun, in one long tracking shot, walking from his home; down the street and into a local shop before coming back again. The items of a kid playing football; a local washing his car and those in and around a local corner shop reoccur in both sequences, the first time Shaun ventures there everything appearing rosy and functioning in a supposedly Utopian world of the working class and of terrace housing. Later on, a similar sequence post-epidemic is provided with the same route taken with similar elements along the way thus suggesting a link between the two existences or 'worlds'. Shaun's inability to tell the respective worlds apart is quite biting, while the zombie-like people plodding to work on board a bus very early on suggests alienation and disenchantment with their functioning lives; an overlying sense of the Western world in the form of seemingly happy kids playing football in the street amidst terrace housing and the working class and their cars already well on its way to ruin.<br/><br/>The film scores points for moulding in the epidemic of the coming of the zombies with the drama going on between partners and housemates as well as it does. This isn't a film as interested in delivering horror genre frills involving zombies as much as it is interested, for the most part, in dealing with character and story. The film is effectively Shaun's shot at proving his worth to Liz, the winning of her back by way of proving his worth to her and ticking off all the more minor items which plagued the development of their relationship before, specifically the inability to fabricate a meeting with Shaun's mother and the threat of competition from David whom it is established is attracted to Liz. The film is a really enjoyable, expertly pitched piece full of heart and genuinely funny – the likes of which ought to be embraced."

","""Shaun of the Dead"" could be considered as a straight zombie film because it reunites all the elements. It has plenty of brutal violence, plenty of gore, witty dialogs, dynamic direction, great characters, and best of all, neat F/X. That's all you need in these kind of flicks.<br/><br/>But ""Shaun..."" takes it to a new direction and inserts black humor, comedy, and even spoofs the fore-mentioned sub-genre.<br/><br/>I dig the violence and brutality caused by the zombies! We get violent wounds caused by guns, beheadings, etc.<br/><br/>The plot is similar to ""Night of the Living Dead"" (obviously) but is told in such a funny manner you can't help but enjoy British humor.<br/><br/>I can safely say this is a straight Horror movie with the right amount of black humor. Give it a try, it's an instant classic for those who are into zombie cinema."

","I love this movie so much. Before watching ""Shaun of the Dead"" you have probably the wrong expectations going into it. Zombie films by nature are supposed to be intense and scary and while this movie does that it does so with hilarious comedy (and a little bit of romance as the film's tag line suggests along the way. I think the humor in this film is what makes it accessible to both Zombie fans and those unfamiliar with Zombie culture alike. <br/><br/>Shaun is a guy stuck in the middle of wanting to grow up and being loyal to his nice but completely immature friend. When he loses his girlfriend, Shaun is dedicated to making a change in his life and stop living just barely getting by. His motivation to change and get his girlfriend back (along with the threat of thousands of zombies) is what drives Shaun to lead the others to safety. Shaun is met with obstacles along the way from his friends, the zombies, and himself. Shaun is faced with choices about loyalty and love and as a result he grows into the more mature but still fun person he longed to be from the beginning of the film. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead's charm is its quirkiness. It's a Zombie film at heart, but it has so many other elements to it that it can be enjoyed by both Zombie fans and those who are new to the genre. I would highly recommend it and who knows it may launch you into an affinity for Zombie films (it did so for me!)"

","Shaun of the Dead does for zombie movies what Hot Fuzz did for cop films. It wasn't quite as successful at it as the movie that would come afterwords, but it was a fine way for Simon and the gang to hone their craft in preparation for their epic buddy cop spoof.<br/><br/>The entertainment value here comes from the humor and the characters, and it succeeds in being better than many of the serious zombie movies that have been released in the last few years. Not much has to be changed in order from zombies to be transformed from horrifying to hilarious.  <br/><br/>There's  lots of in-jokes and foreshadowing that makes repeated viewings just as fun as the first. Trust me, watching a zombie being rhythmically beaten to a Queen song never gets old. Plus fans of the UK Office get the pleasure of seeing Lucy Davis (in a hilarious role) and a few other welcome cameos. Add all that to the pleasure of getting to see Simon Pegg being Simon Pegg, and what more could you want? Zombie fans will love this, plain and simple."
"ajs-10","7","0","4","21 March 2010"," Simon Pegg's Zombie Comedy with Blood Guts & Gore.
","Having been derided by my mates down the pub for not having seen this one, I decided it was time to bite the bullet. Now, I have seen some of Simon Pegg's more recent works, Hot Fuzz (2007) was pretty good, as was Run Fatboy Run (also 2007) and How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (2008). He's now making the big bucks in America, but I was quite interested to see how one of his earlier works turned out.<br/><br/>Shaun lives with two flatmates, Ed and Pete, in London. Ed is always taking Shaun down the local pub, The Winchester, to the disgust of Shaun's girlfriend, Liz. She, and her friends, Dianne and David, want Shaun to break away from Ed and straighten himself out. Unfortunately, Shaun is very attached to Ed; they've known each other since they went to school together. This comes to a head when Liz dumps Shaun and he ends up going out and getting drunk with Ed. As we see them going about their lives we get an inkling that something is not right, people are starting to behave strangely. The morning after, it becomes apparent that something is seriously wrong. News reports confirm that Zombies are loose on the streets and it's not safe out there! Shaun decides to go and rescue his mum, Barbara, and his step-dad, Philip. Then go and get Liz and then go to the pub. So, they have a plan, but there's a lot of Zombies out there! There are a lot of pretty funny bits in this film, I particularly liked the LP scene and the 'Queen' fight scene in the bar. If you've seen the film you'll know the ones I mean. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Simon Pegg as Shaun, Kate Ashfield as Liz, Nick Frost as Ed, Lucy Davis as Dianne and Dylan Moran as David. Honourable mentions also go to Peter Serafinowicz as Pete, Bill Nighy as Philip and Penelope Wilton as Barbara.<br/><br/>So now we come to the nitty gritty, did I enjoy it? Well, it had parts that made me laugh, but as a whole it didn't really bite me on the neck. I found the character of Ed really annoying, he's stupid and very selfish. Yes, he does have a couple of good one-liners, but that doesn't make up for him being an idiot. So over all, it's a pretty dumb comedy, something to watch when you've come back from the pub. I don't think I'll be going out of my way to watch it again, but if I'm late back from the pub one night & it's on TV who knows? My score: 6.5/10"

","Its indeed very hard to describe this movie. This is a rare master piece whose genre are horror and comedy. When i say this, this is not the ""Scary Movie"" type junkies where horror is made fun. But this flick is of ultimate entertainment.<br/><br/>A man who lives with his carefree friend, who was dumped by his girl friend wakes up after all night booze to find a girl in their home's backyard. When they approach to help her, they find she is a zombie. And the fun begins after that. They come to know the whole city is full of zombies and they need a safe place to quarantine themselves. So on the way he picks up his mom, his girl friend and some of the other friends and they get into a pub. In midst of all these events, they are constantly attacked by the zombies powered by emotional drama at times but with a laugh riot in each scene. This is a rare piece of gem which will make you scare, feel bad with a smile on your face through the flick. If you want to see a different type of flick from the stereo types, go for it. Three Cheers to the crew and their finest acting and not to forget some mind-blowing dialogs."
"kenjha","7","0","1","5 December 2009"," Mild Spoof
","In this spoof of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" London is under siege by zombies as a sales clerk heroically attempts to lead his family and friends to safety. The film wants to have it both ways - be a gory horror film and be a comedy, with the result being mild amusement. The funniest moments are the TV reports about zombies and the best way to deal with them. While the concept is initially somewhat funny in that understated British humor style, it soon runs of steam and goes on far too long. Pegg, who co-wrote the screenplay, makes a good nerdy hero. Somehow this middling comedy has achieved the same kind of cult status as the film it is spoofing."

I can watch this movie every weekend, and I recommend to everyone to watch this movie in free weekend, it makes you to smile for a little bit before hard week starting. The second thing is that this movie has an interesting story which goes and comes around, the most important thing is Winchester, where the most interesting action happens. So sad that only two of them (Shaun and Liz) survived, but I was glad by the end to see one survived zombie, who still lived his normal all day life (Ed). After all, the movie is well done, 2004 it had to be the Comedy of the year, it does have very funny and perfect movie thing elements, wonderful and great family movie!<br/><br/>9/10"
"Danusha_Goska","7","0","3","25 October 2009"," Best Part: First Half Hour
","The first half hour of ""Shaun of the Dead"" is the best part for viewers like me who love movies and wanted to see this cult classic but who don't like seeing human beings disemboweled and cannibalized. The first half hour is also the funniest part. The zombies don't come out in full force until later in the film.<br/><br/>The first part of the film brilliantly parodies the conventions of zombie films. ""Shaun"" looks and works like a zombie film, but it's depicting average, working class Britons going about their daily lives. This isn't just funny, it's pointed social commentary. Simon Pegg, the writer / star, is suggesting, with as much depth and more cleverness than Becket, that daily life is a struggle through crushing routine, and that escapes and rewards like booze, cigarettes, video games and friends who suck us into lives of low expectations, dull and blind us all. In the best scene in the movie, the zombies have already taken over, and Shaun doesn't even realize it. He crosses a street full of zombies, enters a store wrecked by zombies, selects his standard snacks from a freezer case covered with handprints, slips in a pool of blood, and never notices a thing.<br/><br/>Eventually, of course, the inevitable gore splatters across the screen. Loved ones turn into zombies and must be killed. Friends are eaten alive by zombies. Ravenous zombies menace the few remaining humans. It gets pretty gross and scary, and stops being as funny as it had been."

","Shaun's life is in a rut, in danger of losing his girlfriend, a let down to his family and his best friend is a total loser. Then flesh-chomping zombies suddenly start to take over the city and Shaun is thrust into the mix as a potential saviour of his family and friends.<br/><br/>In 1999 a Channel 4 sitcom called Spaced, written by Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, and directed by Edgar Wright, become a massive cult hit because of its pop-culture references, sharp music, movie geekery and jokes, lots of jokes. Shaun Of The Dead is born out of an episode of that show called ""Art,"" where a sketch had a drug induced Pegg fighting off a Resident Evil inspired zombie invasion. For the big screen outing Wright again directs with Pegg and many of the Spaced cast also turning up for the fun and horror frolics.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead is of course a play on George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, something that straight away sets the marker for exactly what type of film to expect. With ""Shaun"" the makers are proudly homaging and parodying a genre of film they so obviously love. In fact one can have enough of a good time just spotting the horror reference's and links that dot themselves throughout the picture. However, in amongst the frivolity, and there is much of that, is the point that zombies amble thru real life frequently. There is a chance that as you laugh here, you will also be faced with a horrified recognition of every day life. So with that, Shaun Of The Dead comes close to being a dark comedy masterpiece. It's not for nothing that our main protagonists and hero's in waiting are slackers extrordinair, life struggler's who's only solace is beer and video games. Think about it!.<br/><br/>Falling down just a touch with its eagerness to contain some serious moments, ""Shaun"" does however deserve its place on any list containing great horror comedies, and not just British ones either. Perhaps surprisingly, because of its very British sensibility, it has proved very popular with American audiences, more so thru its various disc releases. Notable fans such as Romero himself and horror writing tsar Stephen King have stepped forward to voice approval. If it at times it feels like it's a bunch of mates making a horror comedy, that's because it is. And hooray to that because cinema, and the sub-genre the film belongs too, is all the better for it. The team from here went on to make the brilliant action cop homage Hot Fuzz, and at some point we will see the completion of their ""ice-cream"" trilogy with the release of The World's End. I and many others simply can't wait for the latest instalment from a team of movie lovers making movies for movie lovers. 8.5/10"

Whilst I still believe that the ending loses it's way a little (with much of the comedy being ditched in favour of gore, action and attempts at emotional drama), as horror comedies go, this is definitely one of the best.<br/><br/>The deadpan and often surreal humour certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but those who enjoyed director Edgar Wright's TV series Spaced and who have watched an unhealthily disproportionate amount of zombie films will be guaranteed a good time, as Pegg and friends lampoon the 'dead' films of George Romero with an obvious and genuine affection for the genre.<br/><br/>Best moment: when Nick Frost shouts 'We're coming to get you, Barbara'.

","If ""Shaun of the Dead"" looks like an extended episode of, or a pilot for, a British TV series then that is no bad thing since those involved have mainly cut their teeth on television and this is the kind of thing that television does so well. ('Alternative' comedy on British television has always been so much better than anything the Big Screen has given us in recent times). It is, of course, a homage to and a pastiche of Romero's Zombie movies as well as being formatted in such a way as to pay tribute to the best of the Comic Strip creations.<br/><br/>It's genuinely funny but it works because it also takes itself seriously; in this respect, it is vastly superior to Danny Boyle's misguided zombie movie ""28 Days Later"". Of course, you need to be very clever indeed to pull off a lampoon of a genre that has become somewhat self-consciously a lampoon in itself. There is only so much you can do with putrid, decomposing corpses that won't lie down no matter what, ('Go for the brain', is the advice given here), and with each succeeding movie the fright factor diminishes, so if 'Shaun' never hits a perfect ten on the terror scales it comes reasonably close where pity is concerned. The skill of the film-makers is in creating characters we believe in and whose fate we care about, no mean feat in what is essentially a gross-out comedy. But then the British have always been good at this sort of thing, applying an intelligence to the proceedings that American can only dream about."

","Shaun of the Dead is a excellent comedy film, showing that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are two of the best comedy talents to come out of Britain in recent years.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is a movie that works on a number of levels. It is a parody of the zombie films made by George A. Romero and unlike films like Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans, they do it out of a love of the films and don't throw in everything that was mildly popular at the time. Romero liked the film so much he even gave Pegg and Wright a cameo in Land of the Dead. Shaun of the Dead also works because it is well written, with get jokes and dialogue, and good acting from Pegg and Nick Frost. It has a fun plot and shows the problems of the Romero films, such as the zombie moving slowly and uses these problems. It has other jokes besides from making fun of the zombie and horror genre which helps the film a lot and has issues such as relationships between partners and friends.<br/><br/>The story of the film was Shaun (Pegg), is man in his late twenties and has little to show for it. He works at an electronics store in North London, he lives in a house with his best friends from university and primacy school and both of them don't get along. Shaun was also struggling with his relationship with his girlfriend and had a strain relationship with his step-father (the brilliant Bill Nighy) and he spend most of his free time at the Winchester pub and playing Playstation games. To top things off the dead are raising from their graves and starting to roam London, but no-one seems to notice. Liz (Kate Ashfield) broke with Shaun near the beginning of the film and he tries to get up together with her. As the zombie start to become more numerous and danger more inevitable Shaun sees it as the perfect opportunity to get back in Liz's good books and planned to save her and his mum and go to the Winchester until the situation had blown over. However, he plan unravels as he tried to save them.<br/><br/>The film is deliciously violence. Fans of modern British comedy such as Spaced and the Office will find a lot of to like about it. They are also good cameos from Coldplay and Trisha and on the DVD expands of these on the extras. Shaun of the Dead is worthy of multiple viewers and is a great film."

There's a lot of cheeky humour and grisly gore played for laughs, and the whole thing is thoroughly entertaining without ever quite feeling like a comedy classic.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"quatermax-1","8","0","3","8 February 2008"," I really can't recommend this highly enough to both horror and Brit-com fans...
","What's that? A British comedy you say? Hugh Grant is it? No? Well, at least Richard Curtis will have written it so it should be o.k. What? He's not involved either? Surely you jest! No I do not. Thank God there are some courageous people out there or this would never have been given the green light, which would have been a tragedy because it's one of the most original, refreshing and downright funny British films for years.<br/><br/>No-hoper Shaun (Pegg) is stuck in a rut. His life is on hold, much to the frustration of his girlfriend Liz (Ashfield). The situation is not helped by the ever-present Ed (Frost), Shaun's best friend, but who sadly is a lazy, computer game playing slob with the tendency to drag the devoted Shaun down with him. Shaun's life revolves around (apart from Ed that is) his local pub, the Winchester, but Liz wants him to motivate himself, to be more adventurous and more ambitious. She fails however and finally gives him the elbow. Shaun is gutted. He drowns his sorrows with Ed and in doing so misses out on the overnight takeover of the planet by undead zombies ('don't use the 'Z' word!'). The next morning, in his hung over state, he routinely walks down to his local shop but is totally oblivious to the carnage and the aforesaid walking dead all about him, only finally noticing when two turn up in his garden. After trying to dispatch them by throwing various kitchen appliances and long-playing records (selected  not the good stuff), Shaun finally discovers that a good whack about the head with a cricket bat does the job. After this rude awakening from their booze induced slumber, Shaun and Ed decide to rescue girlfriend Liz, Shaun's dotty mother and a stepfather he's never gotten along with and take them somewhere they know is safe and secure  the Winchester of course. Easier said than done The origins of the title are obvious and, billed as 'A Romantic Comedy - with Zombies' or a 'Rom-Zom-Com', this is exactly what it says on the can. The Zombies are suitably Romero-ish and deadly serious; the action is as graphic as it gets with guts being ripped out and limbs ripped off (but still handy for beating zombies over the head with) and, although there's plenty of humour along the way to keep the mood light, there is genuine anxiety when these touchingly drawn dysfunctional characters are in jeopardy, which stops it short of being an EVIL DEAD 2, which was funny but plain silly.<br/><br/>The entire cast is excellent, particularly Pegg (who also co-wrote the script) and Frost, who virtually reprise their roles from the comedy series SPACED, which also starred Jessica Stevenson and Peter Serafinowicz who have smaller roles in this also. The rest of the cast consists of other luminaries from recent Brit-com series BLACK BOOKS and the award winning THE OFFICE, plus the terrific Penelope Wilton (CALENDAR GIRLS) and Bill Nighy (LOVE ACTUALLY, UNDERWORLD) as Shaun's mum and stepfather.<br/><br/>The special features are extensive, in fact more than I think I've seen on any other DVD, and include, as well as all the usual stuff, the full length spoof TV spots and news bulletins that we only see snippets of in the movie, a video diary of two extras who played a couple of zombies, four different audio commentaries and lots more.<br/><br/>I'm still chuckling at single lines from the movie ('I don't really think it's in me to shoot my flat-mate, my mother AND my girlfriend all on the same day') and I really can't recommend this highly enough to both horror and Brit-com fans."

It is filmed and directed fantastically, with great detail and care and it's got plenty of blood and guts if that's your thing.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is such a great actor and he is so easy to watch, he makes me laugh and feel sad and his partnership with Nick Frost is inspiring.<br/><br/>Overall, a cult film in my opinion, so much better than any other modern comedies which rely too much on 'gross out' humour rather than wit and intelligence, plus this has got the blood too, what more could you want, as the film poster says, it's got romance too, but not heavy on it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?"

","OK, so it may not be the scariest, but this is probably the best horror film I've seen in a long time. Technically it's a comedy but we'll keep that quiet for now! Having seen Hot Fuzz and loving it, naturally I had to get the DVD of this, and I have to say, it was very hard to find, even in the UK where it's very popular. But I finally did and here we are. Anyway, the film. It's hilarious, it really is. ""A romantic comedy. With zombies."" It works really well as an homage the Living Dead series because the zombies follow Romero's laws for pretty much most of the film, and are never directly funny themselves, which is very important. It's what is done to them and the way the characters react to them that makes the film funny. If the zombies had been made in any way comedic then this film would have failed. That's what I really like about this film.<br/><br/>It also makes a jab at things that happen in real life that you never think of, such as ""would you like another tissue?"" which people ask bitten people who are holding a wad of tissues over their zombie wounds, which is one of those little things that I like about it.<br/><br/>The visual style of the film is pretty impressive, referencing video games etc. using a kinetic directorial style during a lot of the action sequences and switching to first-person occasionally.<br/><br/>Like Hot Fuzz, the music in the film is excellent, and always fits in with its scene.<br/><br/>Overall, the film works excellently as an homage and a stand-alone zombie film and deserves its cult status."
"geertvdheide","8","0","2","18 December 2007"," One of the best comedies ever!
","Shaun of the Dead is a must-see film for all lovers of comedy or horror. The ridiculous plot, characters, dialogs and events in the movie are not just hilarious, but also smart and well written. The horror aspects can be gory, but are funny at the same time. This movie is very different from many of the horny and shallow American teen comedies of recent years. Expect something completely fresh and different.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Shaun, who is trying to change his mundane daily routine and improve his spotty love-life, when the country is suddenly hit by an all out zombie outbreak. The movie juggles comedy, horror and some romance and manages to deliver on all three of those.<br/><br/>Like the movie it was based on, Shaun of the Dead also comments on modern society in a clever and unconventional way, adding even more to this amazing film. The perfect comedic delivery of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really make this movie stand out as one of the best comedies of all time.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, and the concept sounds even remotely appealing, then go watch it now. Who could possibly be disappointed by a movie that combines zombies, romance and humor into one crazy movie?"

"marsean9","10","0","2","23 August 2007"," So what's the Plan then?
","Actually I was just curious of this movie because of Hot Fuzz(great one if you asked me). Since I discovered it was made by the same person behind the aforementioned, I read some reviews and can't help myself but see this one. And BAM!!!!! Wow!!! Can't even believe I missed this kind of movie at the cinema though can't remember if this was shown on our local theatre.<br/><br/>But ever since I started watching I was addicted already, worth a numerous viewing. Thanks to its memorable quotes and scenes that to this day keeps me giggle. For example where the zombified pub owner was attacked by the three protagonist in the tune of ""Don't stop me now"" by Queen. Not that original though but still hilarious. Wright and Pegg really deserves some credits here(they did it again in Hot Fuzz), such witty and carefully crafted dialogues. I can't even spot some references the fourth time around for its subtleness.<br/><br/>Though the story is very simple, the humor that keeps the story worth watchable, a man in his late twenties, Shaun(Pegg), with some issues even me faces in life, his gal(Ashfield), his pal(Frost), his flatmate(Seranifowicz), his mum(Wilton), his dad... I mean stepdad(Nighy). Because of this he's not even distracted by the plague occurrences until the confrontation with the zombie... oops the ""zed"" word itself. So what do you think they should do? ""Well, have a sit down?"" Lol. Priceless.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies with characters that can quickly adapt to such situation, this movie shows how stupid people can still make stupid plans in the middle of a crisis. ""Take car. Go to mum's. Kill Phil - ""Sorry."" - grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over."" How's that for a change? But what a great character development happens to Shaun later on the movie.I was really sorry for him. Can't believe myself I feel his pain, great execution by the actor, two thumbs up. Though I thought he was a real action star in Hot Fuzz. Well he fooled me there. Shame.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie to everyone. Don't be fooled by the title. It's not a spoof as everyone thought its more of a homage. Its a story that spoof itself with references and with tight script. No wonder Romero love this movie. Though you may be disturbed for its gore, saddened for its heavy scenes, laugh for its seriousness and laugh some more for its craziness.<br/><br/>The whole thing is its entertaining. It really beats the like of Spiderman, Shrek and Pirates of the Caribbean sequels - Uumm... ""That is not true, made up, shouldn't have said that, Sorry"". Makes a good addition to your collection. Classic already."
"bubs933","9","0","2","6 August 2007"," A hilarious take on Zombie Movies and Modern Life
","This movie has to be one of the most unique Zombies movies. A Romance-Comedy with Zombies. Unlike many horror films, the characters in this movie are very likable. Furthermore, ""Shaun of the Dead"" does an excellent job taking jabs at modern life, where your average office drone is almost like a zombie. My favorite scene was the part in which Shaun strolls through his destroyed, zombie-infested neighborhood completely oblivious to the mayhem around him. I really laughed hard when Shaun got a soda from the freezer covered with bloody hand prints. The only thing I wished they had done is given Pete more screen time. Pete was probably one of the funniest characters in the movie, with lines like: ""It's F-cking Sunday, and I have to go to f-cking work in four f-cking hours, 'cause very other f-cker in my f-cking department is f-cking ill. NOW CAN YOU SEE WHY I'M SO F-CKING ANGRY????!!!!!!!!"""
"jmbartle","9","0","2","6 August 2007"," Imagine Monty Python Making a Zombie Film
","Hilarious! Think Monty Python meets zombies. It just has such a dry, biting wit about it, that you have to love it. To me this movie, like most of the Monty Python flicks, has tons of replay value. You can have fun with it time and time again, and never get sick of the jokes.<br/><br/>I think the reason for this is because Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg aren't trying to hard to be funny. Their humor appears to be something that just flows naturally for them. Also Simon Pegg and Nick Frost make a great comedic duo.<br/><br/>Not only does it work as comedy, but it also works as a great homage to classic zombie flicks, which happens to be one of my favorite horror genres. It manages to take elements from zombie classic and make them funny without mocking the source material.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the zombies look cool, and its filled with slightly over the top gore. What more could you ask for? Definitely one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile!"
"dragonshield","7","0","3","30 May 2007"," Absolutely hilarious
","I had never seen this movie until two days ago and if YOU haven't I suggest you do. ""Shaun of the Dead"" tells about a man named Shaun who works in an electronic goods shop. He spends his days with his unemployed friend Ed either playing video games at home or drinking in a local pub ""Winchester"". Shaun is pretty much what you could describe as a ""loser"". He has a girlfriend, Liz, who suddenly after 3 years of being together has had enough of Shaun's attitude towards things, never having an adventure or basically anything different. This of course leads to a break-up. Suddenly almost the whole London catches sort of an epidemic and everyone starts to turn as the living dead, zombies. Shaun figures out that he has his life's biggest opportunity to prove his ex-girlfriend that he is not a loser. Things lead to another and well, it's done in a way that won't give you time to stop laughing.<br/><br/>One thing that surprised me a lot is how well the whole movie was made. I mean, it's a comedy after all and it's not every day you see a comedy where they've really put some time and effort to make it. The whole world and the zombies are done like in any other serious movie, so believably and so realistically. This already gives the movie something that keeps you interested throughout besides the story, which in its parodied way is also surprisingly well written. Although the zombie -thing working as the main story in the movie, you could imagine the movie as a romantic comedy as well. The movie takes a while before the zombies even kick into the plot and the best thing is that the things before that moment is not even irrelevant in any kind of way. It kinda evolves the story, builds up the characters and the whole main theme, letting the viewer inside the actual story. Brilliant in a way I'd say.<br/><br/>The one thing where the movie has its definite highlight is the humour, which is absolutely hilarious. To me as a fan of the British accent (although to be exact I especially love the cockney accent) the movie's jokes were top notch. You just can't say some things in another accent than the British one and to be honest when I had my Finnish subtitles on I really didn't even pay attention to them as some of the jokes are just so poorly translated they loose their purpose and meaning completely. Although the movie being a total laugh packed ride, the jokes sadly start to repeat themselves and it does get a bit repetitive. When you think about that it's a really hard thing to prevent really. When it comes to parodies they usually stumble in that way towards the end, so it's a very common problem. Despite it this movie doesn't do it so much you could imagine, so it's a real achievement. The film also includes so called ""long jokes"" which aren't so funny at the first time but when repeated they eventually get funny and when they're done in places where you wouldn't expect them at all they have their moment and it's magnificent.<br/><br/>Although the movie being a parody all the way through I was also surprised how good the acting was in it. It does have drama in it too, yet done in a satiric way. The brilliant Simon Pegg as Shaun, Nick Frost as Ed, the always hilarious Bill Nighy as Philip the stepfather, Kate Ashfield as Liz and Dylan Moran as David, the whole cast is carefully and very successfully chosen. When it comes to comedies like this one the acting is usually done over the top to make it funnier. Well, the acting in this movie also goes over the top, but it's done so unbelievably well by amazing actors/actresses and in a way I've never seen before. Usually when the acting is meant to be over the top, it's usually funny at the first time but you get bored of it very quickly and it gets so unfunny and (I can't believe I'm saying this) unrealistic. Though it is actually meant to be unrealistic, ""Shaun of the Dead"" does the unrealistic so realistically and the unbelievable so believably. Now that's what I call a huge achievement, very nice indeed.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" is all in all a great comedy. It has a surprisingly good storyline which keeps you interested throughout, including humour which just makes you laugh so hard, even giggle after the actual movie has ended. It's silly, but it's silly in a good way. They don't make comedies like this so much and when they do it's a great achievement. It's always a real gem for the comedy film industry and you just have to give your two thumbs up. The movie sadly suffers from already mentioned slight repetitiveness, but when it comes to the end it really doesn't matter so much, but that's what also lowers my final rating of the movie. If you want to laugh, seriously, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is a movie for you. Great."
"zoeyneo","8","0","2","27 April 2007"," subtle, sublime
","I finally saw this after many people had built it up for me, and I'm happy to report that it was all I ever hoped it could be. Shaun of the Dead is a truly original style of film. It is not a parody, though it is funny and does play with references to some well-known horror films. It is a fresh, creative, zombie story in its own right, and simultaneously a comedy. The nods to previous zombie movies are clever and come naturally, unlike how excruciatingly forced they are in lesser films like the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. The characters are all very honest, real, and have distinct personalities. Most of the film takes place in the day time, with the main characters handling the situation quite rationally. It is a fantastically successful new spin on things, and highly recommended."
"Quinoa1984","7","0","5","21 April 2007"," slightly genre-confused, but still a good comedy/horror show
","Shaun of the Dead has 2/3 of the most ingenious British comedy of 2004, or for that matter the past several years, and even has that appeal that romantic comedies only wish they could achieve in their timing and believable characters, however slacker-ish they are here. Then there's something interesting that goes on as Edgar Wright gets enveloped in making a pure zombie movie, and, for me, odd as it sounds, it doesn't totally work. I could understand why the shift comes, as danger looms in with the un-dead taking over the British village Pegg and Frost have to defend at all costs. At the same time, it's not quite as fulfilling as the razor-sharp satire and visual wackiness that went on in the main chunk of the picture. This being said, it's the kind of ""cult"" movie that works at its best because it feeds off of said previous ""cult"" movies like a flesh-eater on an intestinal tract; it knows how stupid it would be, however entertaining in an abstract way, if the un-dead started to rise and took over a little town or suburb or other. ""Let's go to the pub"" isn't too far of a stretch for these guys as the mall was in Dawn of the Dead.<br/><br/>As it stands, from having seen the film quite a while ago, it stays fresh in your mind for a while, for what works wonderfully in its violent and absent-minded glory (hmm, what's really going on here, is the tone for the first part), as well as a plum supporting role from Bill Nighy, and from what doesn't quite work. The last section, unfortunately, doesn't quite strike up the same level of delirious humor that it should, and ironically compared to the original Dawn of the Dead's last section, it's dead-pan without being hilarious, and just a straight-forward horror-fest. Which is fine, but the shift is sort of jarring and something that I didn't think quite recovered by the end of the film, albeit with the nice wink in the final shot. It's the kind of good British comedy that works best with a bunch of friends and a totally tuned-in sense of humor...or, perhaps, just someone looking for a different level of social satire with their zombie movie."

But, as funny as this movie is it still has some good scares. The zombies look very good, not too overly gory or gruesome looking. There are several memorable lines that you just want to say over and over again. This brings us to the soundtrack of the movie. It has some great songs, especially ""The Blue Wrath"" the song at the beginning by Imonster. A Queen song also plays in a very memorable scene. If only they would release the soundtrack in America.

The direction and editing are surprisingly fresh for a comedy, and the gore effects are great fun. Add to that some terrific acting, especially by Nick Frost as the big comedic lug and Bill Nighy as the evil stepdad, great use of music - ""Don't Stop Me Now"", anyone? - and some great dialogue, and this is one of my favourite comedies ever and certainly one of the funniest films of the new millennium."

I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't sensitive to blood, gore, horror. It actually wasn't that scary. You couldn't compare it to The Ring, or The Grudge or anything like that. But the movie was slightly scary, but funny. I recommend this movie to people who also like humor, and making fun of horror movies. But there was a lot of blood. The white eyes of the zombies were one of the scariest things from my point of view."
"nicholas-rogers","7","0","2","25 January 2007"," Hilarious, entertaining, enjoyable, but has an obvious plot
","Mix horror, romance, a big dose of dark British humour  and you get a deadly concoction  you get Shaun of the Dead. <br/><br/>Spoof movies so often fail with me, especially the Hollywood variety, such as Scary Movie, where you see the humour flying out at you from a mile away. I have to admit, I was a little hesitant about watching this movie. I only did so because my brother had it on DVD and insisted that I saw it. I also remember it being released in UK cinemas about the same time as the remake of the 70s zombie thriller, Dawn of the Dead, which I found disappointing and put me off watching zombie movies for a long time. But with Shaun of the Dead, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>It starts with Shaun, the protagonist, played by screen-writer/funny-man, Simon Pegg. He's twenty-nine, stuck in a dead-end job, his seventeen year old colleague makes fun of him, he has an awkward flatmate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), he hates his scrutinising step-father Philip (Bill Nighly), he has issues with his mother Barbara (Penelope Winton), his lazy best-mate Ed holds him back in life (Nick Frost), he gets dumped by his girlfriend Jenny (Kate Ashfield) and he spends all day in the Winchester Pub. Yes, Shaun is in a bit of a rut. Then one night, without ever really knowing why, Shaun's locality becomes 'neighbourhood of the living dead'. He is at first oblivious to it all, suffering from a hangover, but soon he realises that zombies are after his blood and he has to buck up his ideas quickly to survive. For once in Shaun's life, he has a plan. With Ed as his side-kick and armed with a cricket bat, a spade and a box of old records (which, by the way, make amusing ninja weapons to fend off zombies), and he goes to save his mum and Jenny in Pete's car. Where does he plan to take them to safety? That's right  the Mecca of Shaun's life and the focal point of the film - the Winchester pub. On the way, Shaun picks up Philip and Jenny's house-mates David (Dylan Moran) and Dianne (Lucy Davis). <br/><br/>The film contains what you expect from a horror, British comedy and romance (kind of); blood, gore, action, slapstick, sarcasm, a witty script, a love interest and, sadly, an obvious plot, but I will talk more about that later.<br/><br/>It has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Shaun and Ed realise the first zombie they meet isn't actually a drunk girl, but a dead person who wants their blood. And when the group pretend to behave like zombies so they don't bring attention to themselves from the living dead. You will learn there is more than one use to a garden swing-ball. The end is also charming, but I don't want to speak about that.<br/><br/>The acting is convincing for a spoof movie. Especially the lazy, rather obnoxious, Ed, played by Nick Frost, who decides to have a friendly chat on a mobile phone with a mate while surrounded by zombies. He plays your annoying fat mate who slows your life down, but is full of clever quips every now and again. He would also go off on hilarious rants with Shaun about, well, not a fat lot. I wouldn't say there were many outstanding performances or Oscar nominations in the movie though, but the movie was not made for awards. It was made to make you laugh, which is what you will undoubtedly be doing. So therefore, the co-writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright (the same team who made the comedy TV-series Spaced and the new movie the Big Fuzz) have certainly achieved their aim. <br/><br/>Now back to the plot. For someone who is not a big fan of spoof movies, the storyline was so obvious, I only had to glance at the title of the movie to guess what was going to happen, and without wanting to ruin the movie for you, I was right. I can't decide if it was a spoof movie of Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, but that's of little importance, the plot is too similar, for my liking anyway. <br/><br/>I'm not the prude sort, and I think when violence, blood and expletives are used correctly, it can make a good film. I don't think Shaun of the Dead was over-run by it, but I do think it maybe should have warranted more than a 15 certificate. I do not think the film is everybody's cup of tea. The sarcasm and the wittiness I particularly liked, and the fact it was a fun, chill-out film to watch. But British humour, especially the sarcasm, and the violence and the swearing, can be hit and miss with many people. I also think more can have been done with Bill Nighly's, Dylan Moran's and Martin Freeman's characters. They are great actors and had relatively small roles than what their reputations deserve. I think Martin Freeman only had two words to say in the whole film. Maybe the actors only wanted small roles, I don't know. But I felt they were wasted, only a little as there was much more talent in the film that made up for it.<br/><br/>There might be something else that you unexpectedly take away from this movie. The film may motivate you, to give you a 'kick up the posterior' and change your life. For Shaun, it took a town full of zombies to make him do this. I certainly hope it takes considerably less than that for the majority of you.<br/><br/>To conclude, as I said before, I'm not a fan of spoofs, due to predictable plots and story lines, but this is way above its contemporaries. It's British. It's different. And it's dead funny; so funny you'll be laughing beyond the grave."

","It's a middle-laughable comedy, with many typical characteristics of the British humour, about a guy who is a loser but doesn't want to accept that! He lives with the typical friend who is ""even loser than him"" and has a girlfriend that is fed up of him because he wants to do always the same things and wants to go always to the same pub: the Winchester! One morning, after his girlfriend dumped him, the world around started to change, people started to have strange reactions and an ugly face but he didn't even noticed! The TV news tried to warn him to a strange epidemic, but he didn't care! Until he found a sympathetic young girl in the garden that he, and his friend Ed, thought just to be a little ""stoned""!! Then, they woke up to the reality: Yes, there were Zombies to get Shaun, his friends and his mum!<br/><br/>It's a spoof movie, a clear parody to the zombies' movies, having some great jokes  the ones that the British are specialists to do  but it's not the kind of movie that you start to laugh in the beginning and just stop in the end! It has its moments. Some of non-sense comedy; some of intelligent humour; but also many of typical clichés. It's not excellent, but it's not bad either, it's just in the middle. In my particular case I got one extra element of humour: I found our ""friend"" Shaun a bit similar (especially in his face) to a husband of a friend of mine (girl, of course)!

","Shaun of The Dead is a really funny comedy,it sort of makes fun out of all the zombie films ever made.And for those of you who think that the zombie films are silly any way and laugh at them, you will find this hilarious.<br/><br/>Shaun is not having a good day his girlfriend has dumped him because he spends too much time with his slob of a mate Ed who sits all day at the computer and does no work.And she is also fed up with them spending so much time down their local pub The Winchester. Shaun is also being undermined in his job by a young group of trainees who he is supposed to be in charge of. His friend Pete who he shares accommodation with is sick of lazy Ed and wants him out. Because Shaun is so depressed he gets drunk one night with Ed,and neither of them realise that the whole of London is being took over by flesh eating zombies.Every where they are walking chaos is happening all around them.Where they keep flicking over the channels on the TV,they keep missing the latest news on the chaos,so they remain totally oblivious. Its not until Ed notices a girl acting very odd in their garden that they decide to go out to investigate,thinking that she is drunk they ask her to leave.She then starts to attack Shaun he pushes her, she falls back onto a pole that is sticking up out of the ground, the pole goes right through her and lots of blood spurts out,they think they have accidentally killed her until she suddenly rises up.They now realise something is definitely wrong.<br/><br/>The rest of the film involves Shaun and Ed trying to rescue girlfriend Liz,Shauns mum and what turns out to be a few others,Liz's college friends and Shauns step-dad. Shauns major plan is that they should all make their way to the Winchester pub where they will all be safe.But will they be?<br/><br/>The film towards the end reaches a big anti-climax,i wont say any more. This is one of the funniest films I've seen for a long time and its not a bad horror flick either.The acting is very good,it combines comedy ,tragedy and romance all in one which isn't easy to do.The actors are little known all though im sure we will be seeing more of them in the future."

","This movie has been in the top 3 most played media on my DVD player over the last two years (the first two being Criterion's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the episode of Family Guy when Brian become a drug sniffing police dog). It has all the right elements in the ""w-right"" proportions (sorry about the pun).<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a pre-Carousel everyman working at a dead end job. Translation : 29 year old appliance salesman. He lives with 2 roommates that are the antithesis of each other. One is Ed (Nick Frost), the overweight, slightly lecherous, fart-making, gorilla impersonating, pot smoking (coincidental) underachiever. The other is Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), who is a type A personality. Shaun also has a counterpart, his girlfriend ,Liz (Kate Ashfield), who has never met his mother and wishes they could spend more time alone together (without Ed - how oxymoronic). Diane and David are Liz's friends, a.k.a. Ed's counterpart. Rounding up the cast is Shaun's Mom and Philip ""He's not my dad. He's my step-dad."" (Bill Nighy). <br/><br/>Shaun can be characterized much like Ed Norton's Fight Club character. In the modern world, Shaun is just ordinary or worse, mediocre. In the extraordinary circumstances he has been placed in, he excels, or perhaps find a purpose. The information about what is happening is in the background of the movie (newspaper headlines, TV new reports, unusual people activities,etc.), however (in a fashion typical to modern man), tends to be ignored or dismissed until it has to be taken care of on a personal basis. It is an interesting commentary/relationship on the over-saturated senses of modern humans and the media creators. It is also in line with the ""zombie"" genre explanation of why things are happening.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright continue their writing/directing magic from Spaced. They bring along most of the cast with them as well (Nick, Pete, Jessica Stevenson, and a couple others now credited as ""zombie"" extras). The dialog is great. It is sharp, full of humor and double-sided. The two provide a lot of homage to everything from Grandmaster Flash & John Romero to John Carpenter & video games. The movie is a great mix of horror, comedy and dramatic moments. There were moments I shed some salty drops and others when I was spasming on the floor laughing. Humor in the face of bizarre and terrifying moments is the overwhelming theme.<br/><br/>There are more quotable quotes and scenes than I have the space or time to write out. Also, it might detract from you enjoyment of the movie. My three favorite moments would have to be :<br/><br/>1) Zombie Acting 101<br/><br/>2) The choreographed zombie beat-down to ""Queen-Don't Stop Me Now"".<br/><br/>3) Introductory title sequence where the mundane activities of the extras are choreographed to ""I Monster-Blue Wrath"".<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I don't know what else to say that will convince you that this is one of the best movies of the new millennium. I you have seen it, then bugger off. Maybe you should go back and see it one more time, since its obvious you haven't had your fill yet. Get stuffed !!"

Second, the humor (sometimes so subtle as to give one that self-satisfying feeling of slight genius) was intelligent for the most part and did not dwell in the basement of tired poo-poo jokes and non-stop slapstick that 96 percent of Hollywood films try to pass off as cleverness.

","Strange comedy, shaun of the dead, unusually intense, but the laughs keep coming one way or another. I love how the zombies blend in so easily at first. Shaun must have seen 17 zombies before he finally figured it out. Similarly, it was entertaining how a number of the main characters were or could be mistaken for zombies during the course of their regular routine, including shaun, his mom, and ed, the obnoxious yet lovable roommate. The Mexican standoff with the beer bottles and the zombie mom was priceless. A nice shout out to Tarantino. <br/><br/>It was a very ""today"" type of movie for various reasons; allusions, eclectic blend of movie genres all gathered into one, and an edgy use of the camera, almost as if to say we know you know you are watching a movie so why try to keep it a secret. Shaun of the dead could be classified as a comedy, horror, romantic comedy, buddy flick, or family drama, and they would all be a little right. So... Shaun of the dead rules."

I was so glad to see that they stuck with genuine British slang and didn't dumb it down for the American audiences. Just a small question. Why does it take so long for Shaun's flatmate, Pete, to become a zombie. He tells Shaun and Ed at 4am that he was bitten on his way home from work, so I'm assuming at the latest he was bitten around 6pm. So after 8 hours he still hasn't become a zombie. Whereas, Shaun's mother and father, sorry step-father, becomes zombies in much less time. What's up with that?"

I mention this because often an episode of Black Books has a small character in them who has a few lines. Nearly every one of those minor characters were in this film Shaun of the Dead. Apart from the lead female, Kate Ashfield, every character in the film has been in Black Books.

No, back a bit,"" fun to be had trying to find the uncredited celebs who appear as zombies. As in ""Spaced"", the movie is littered with filmic references and it's a shame that there isn't a ""Homage-O-Meter"" option in the subtitle menu to point them all out.<br/><br/>The obvious fun that director Edgar Wright and writer/actor Simon Pegg had making this film translates onto the screen.

","I have to hand it to creators of this film; they manage to combine humor, zombies, and a story of love and redemption in a way that's very palatable and fun to watch. This film is not for the faint-of-heart, because, although it's primarily a comedy, there is a boatload of gore, guts, and carnage. It's stylized yet graphic, funny yet not necessarily fake-looking. The dialogue is quick and usually pretty funny, although I didn't find the use of the word ""gay"" particularly funny or necessary. The plot revolves around a guy who works a dead-end job, just got dumped by his girlfriend, and lives with his lazy deadbeat friend. Suddenly, the recently deceased return from the dead and start preying on the living and he has a chance to redeem himself. So, he arms himself with a cricket bat, his friend gets a shovel and they get down to business. There are zombies galore and a lot of humor that will appeal most to the younger (high school and college) crowd. This film is a great homage to George A. Romero's zombie films (among others). In fact, after seeing the film, Romero invited Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg to play zombies in his ""Land of the Dead."" If you are a fan of the zombie genre, you are almost guaranteed to like this film; if not, there is still a solid chance that you will be entertained, but you'll miss out on more homages than Quentin Tarantino can shake a stick at."

","Excellent movie. Definitely a must see. If you love British comedy, you will absolutely love this movie. Not only do you just love every single character in the movie (but especially Shaun and Ed), but the soundtrack is really good, too. You'll never catch all of the witty side comments the first time you see the movie. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone. The acting is good, the storyline is great, the comedy / humor is awesome, and zombie parts of the movie are really good. The only possible negative thing about this movie that I can say is that it definitely is a lower budget movie. Other than that, I've got nothing. Just see the movie...."

","Well okay, maybe not in ages... I do own Braindead and Bad Taste, but still.<br/><br/>As you might guess 'Shaun of the Dead' is a member of humorous zombie splatter movie genre. In this particularly bloody, yet humour lazed horror sub genre SOTD isn't the most bloodiest one, that would be Braindead I think, but it does keep you entertained and it does show, that you can actually keep the minor problems with the deaders as a background issue, while the Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to mend his relationship with his girl Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br/><br/>The main question in this genre is how well do the jokes interact with the massacre. In this case I may say, that I laughed hard in some places and if not out loud then I managed to get a smirk on my face while watching.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite good and while the zombie mask aren't from the most imaginative I've seen they work very well. I believe, that a fans of the genre would find this movie entertaining and I actually think, that even the non fans get a couple of chuckles out of it, as I said, the gore level isn't from the highest end."

","""Shaun of The Dead"" is an incredibly funny comedy/horror film in which an unlikely hero is born out of incredibly ugly circumstances.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg)is a loser: his co-workers at the appliance give him a hard time, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield)dumps him, and his life just seems to not have any focus. His only friend is Ed (Nick Frost),who speaks his mind just a bit too much. It just seems that Shaun's life can't get any worse.<br/><br/>Until the zombies invade.<br/><br/>At first oblivious to everything (walking to the store as zombies are walking everywhere), Shaun and Ed wise up and plan on getting his family and friends to a safe place. However, things don't go as planned. Not only do they have to deal with the zombie invasion, but they have to deal with everyday issues (Which Prince album should be used to throw at the zombies? ""Purple Rain,"" ""Sign O' The Times"" or ""Batman?"").<br/><br/>This came out during the time when zombies/undead ruled the box office (The remake of ""Dawn of The Dead,"" ""28 Days Later""), and it is an incredibly funny. The most hilarious part has to do with Shaun and Co. have to practice being zombies (""Who died and made you f*****g king of the zombies?""one of the guys said about his imitation)and as they're walking through the crowd, Ed gets a call on his cell phone and talks to his friends as his friends (And zombies)look on.<br/><br/>Shaun looks and acts like the unlikeliest of heroes, and he manages not only to become the leader of the band (despite constant complaining from one of the group members), but he manages to save the girl and keep his best friend (In a very weird way).<br/><br/>A film that should not be missed and a must have in your collection.

"zilief","10","0","1","20 May 2006"," The best Z-word--movie ever, closer to you than it ever was!
","Some movies just perfectly fit one genre, so that they finally overwhelm it...This is here the case, just as ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" is more than just the best western-movie ever... ""Shaun of the dead"" uses the symbolics of the zombie invasion as it was used in the first Romero's : we're all already dead folks, as far as modern life is concerned(OK, I promise I won't talk about symbolism anymore...)...Thus, plus the fact that all of this is done in a really funny and genre-respectful way! Shaun is something like an impossible crossover between the Z-movie and the 30like sitcom, with a 30like yo hero stuck in a store selling TV sets alongside with dull acneic teens thinking (and telling) he's a loser...By the time he realizes the world is being invaded by man-eating zombies, his girlfriend drops him out, which seems to be far more uneasy for him to accept than the rest... If you add the fact that it's always flipping between the rawest comedy and the harshest drama, things are beginning to get really good for you viewer, as the more you laugh, the more the characters get sympathetic, and the more you get really touched by what happens to them (as opposed, for example, to the fact that we don't give a f*ck about whatever happens to Neo in Matrix...).This is a brilliantly efficient way to keep you concerned and surprised from the beginning to the end. Another trick used to get you wondering what you might do might it happen to you (and yes you wonder, even if you rationally know that this won't happen...) is what I call the proximity-FX, having a hero so ordinary, his best friend selling weed and playing VG all day long, and a goal twisting between avoiding to be eaten alive and getting the girlfriend back...In this category enters something you in the US probably won't feel as much as we do in Europe: you're used to see your streets filled with Dodge and Chrysler exploding while being chased by crazy-machine-gunslinging choppers (this is America, I saw it on TV!), but we're not! And I admit that seeing anyone trying to flee away from a zombie-horde in a red renault Megane definitely gives me the creeps, as this is one car I may actually use if I ever have to do it myself! Go and run to your video-store if you had'n't seen it yet as anything in this movie is perfect: the whole cast (the dead-in-his-heart employee-of-the-month, the Bigbie-like best friend and his invasive weed business and laziness, the very touching mother and father-in-law, all of the team following Shaun and the mirror-team following his ex-girlfriend,the girlfriends' friends looking like a grown-up and boring Harry Potter and a living Barbie doll...)as they all fit perfectly written characters, the filming (watch for the double and mirrored sequence shot in the beginning or the plans to get the girlfriend back!), the twisted yet classic scenario illuminated with instant-cult-scenes (you don't know yet but a vinyl of Sade may actually save your life!)... All of these make this movie an absolute must-see!go and get it,buy it, rent it or steal it, buy popcorn, sit well and enjoy alone,with your friends,girl/boy-friend or dog or grandma or anyone you want to have with you when you have a real good time!Shaun rocks!!!"

With so many funny moments Simon Pegg's timing is impeccable and with the righteously hilarious Frost the partnership thrives....Even when you know a scene is gong to be funny and you have seen it before, you will be quoting and giggling before the scene is out.<br/><br/>This film is destined to become a classic which has probably been written on many reviews, but the more its written the quicker it becomes one, and with so many brilliant American comedies in recent years it's just great to see one on our own shores to rival them all,<br/><br/>THE BEST COMEDY IN YEARS!!!!!"

And for those people that disagree with me, you obviously don't know what a good movie is, because this is, without question, a good example of one.

To make the matter worst, it all happens when the whole town goes on a strange biological change.<br/><br/>That night to cure the broken heart, Shaun and Ed went on a bar to get drunk badly and parties at their apartment.

Wow what a pace cutting experience, all the credits goes to Chris Dickens for his masterful editing. <br/><br/>Also soul for this Zombie movie was stunningly created by Daniel Mudford and Pete Woodhead under Nick Angel.

"KUAlum26","10","0","1","1 March 2005"," Usage of Queen Music:Always a Bonus!
","I just saw this film a few days ago on video--I don't recall if it ever made it to my hometown,it might've made it to Lawrence,which is 20 plus miles east of here--and was VERY impressed. I found myself drawing comparisons of this show to the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake,which came out both in theatre and video/DVD relatively close to each other. While I liked and was sufficiently entertained by DOTD 2004,I was more impressed with this effort,mostly due to the copious amount of comedy and pathos that gives this zombie flick a little more depth(I also enjoyed this ending more than DOTD's,but that would be a spoiler if I told you why).<br/><br/>The English sensibility of this film(i.e. a lot of arguing,a sort of Soccer-hooligan sensibility to its violence)makes the horror element of this film both real and hilarious,no mean feat there! The hero,Shaun,you become familiar with as a basically good guy with low aspirations and a sinking sense of boredom in life. His best friend,Ed,is a disgusting yet amiable loser and his girlfriend,Liz,might seem grating and prattling on first observation,but she is basically kind and sensible,a perfect foil for Shaun. The fact that zombies are taking over London slowly sinks in,and isn't helped by the fact that(and this bit I have no doubt was the filmmakers tongue-in-cheek jab at London/British urban lifestyle)many locals are already lethargic,slow-moving,inarticulate sorts. There is much confusion over who is undead and who is merely drunk in this film,and there are some great visual similarities between the undead and Shaun himself. By the time it is eminently clear that London,perhaps all of England and maybe even the world,is being overtaken by the walking dead,it becomes a full-on race and struggle for survival. Par for the course there,the signature of any ordinary film of this genre. But the way the principal characters react to the situation and each other is both very palpable,aggravating(it doesn't dawn on them until about 2/3 of the way through the film that they should SHOOT THE ZOMBIES IN THE HEAD?)and funny. The ending may seem a bit of a cop-out for some,but it fits the rhythm of the movie as it was set up.<br/><br/>Horror-comedies are rare(and I'm ready to give a rhetorical beat-down to the next person who thinks the ""Scream"" movies are parodies. The ""Scary Movie"" films ARE.)and probably somewhat difficult to make. I suppose ""Love at First Bite"" or ""American Werewolf in London"" might be considered examples. But this film is able to balance the scares,gore and other conventions of thriller flicks with - daffy,pratfall comedy,and that makes this film very special. The amount of pop music references and usage(Queen in particular)is something that sealed the deal for me. <br/><br/>I probably would've voted a 9.5 for this one,since I don't really fancy myself a horror movie aficionado,but since you cannot vote like that on IMDb,so I rounded up."

","I'm a bit of a zombie purist.. Dawn of the Dead is one of my top 10 favorites film. I love the cinematography, and the irony of the ambulatory corpses shuffling around the shopping center as is their old habit. But the recent glut of zombie film depicts them as steroid-enraged track stars drooling blood. They move so fast whenever one is killed or merely shot, the camera zooms in so fast you don't see the impact. Saves the big budget film some bucks on squibs I guess. But also it lacks imagination. You can always add the whiz and growl effects in post.<br/><br/>Well thank the producers of Shaun of the dead for not only giving the zombies a plausible pacing, but making them memorable personality wise. In Dawn you have the helicopter zombie, the machete victim, many more. When Shaun goes to the deli shop for the first time, you get the outlay of the neighborhood with all the familiar characters he sees everyday in almost the same spot. To name a few; The soccer playing kid The Jamaican guy washing his car The panhandler The Indian grocery owner The one-armed guy in the blue tux.<br/><br/>If you listen to the commentary track, you'll find that every zombie character appears in an earlier scene in a living state.

Lucy Davis (from the office) shows enthusiasm in the role and she should be proud of her performance- so should all the others as well.

","There are movies like Army of Darkness that poke fun at themselves and get some laughs along the way. There are movies like Scary Movie that pretty much play out as a long sequence of gross jokes. But then there are the very rare films (like Shaun of the Dead) that belittle entire genres of movies while still showing life of their own, creativity, and a kind of weirdness that can't help but entertain.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead gives us Shaun, a hero of all heroes, who must save the world from zombies that bite people to turn them into zombies themselves. Shaun's tragic flaw is his friend, Ed, who pretty much sits around all day and does nothing, but he and Ed need to rescue Shaun's mom (and stepdad) and Shaun's ex-girlfriend (and her flatmates). None of the performances are especially dramatic, but all actors, in both major and supporting roles, do quite a good job.<br/><br/>Everything is done in jest, with kind of an obviously feigned seriousness that makes the film all the more hilarious. Also, a brilliant comparison near the beginning of the film gives it creative flavor and strikes interest with the viewer. The characters' reactions to the zombies, especially the reactions of Shaun and Ed, are very similar to the reactions of regular characters in zombie films, but satirical enough to draw many laughs. There are some specific scenes that stand out as especially creative and bizarre, but they must be viewed for full effect.<br/><br/>The direction, then, by Edgar Wright, isn't earth-shattering, but it's adequate for the subject matter, and I, personally, enjoyed the non-original music selections at place in the film. The film's strongest point is its screenplay, but it does contain some confusion for the viewer. For instance, there are certain points in the film that approach the realm of the sentimental, and the viewer cannot figure out whether what's on screen is meant to be viewed jokingly or meant to evoke sympathy for these brilliant characters. And even though the film is very, very funny, there are lines, especially those that make use of scatological humor, that are very not funny and leave a sour taste in the viewer's mouth.<br/><br/>Yet this movie entertains almost to its full potential. Don't watch if you're looking for something profound or classic, but definitely take in a viewing of Shaun of the Dead if you're looking for a comedy that's pretty smart and often hilarious and creative.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B."

""Night of the Living Dead"" ripoffs are so common, one often has an aversion to parodies of this sort which have become a genre of their own. Nevertheless, this is a good-natured satire which this viewer found very entertaining. The characters are quirky without being bizarre, and there is a good deal of amusing self-parody - for instance, having one of the characters improbably exclaim, ""we're going to get you, Barbara,"" referencing one of ""Living Dead's"" most well-known lines.

"JimD73","9","0","1","3 February 2005"," Shaun of the Dead Good Zombie-Beating Fun!
","I'm by no means an expert on zombie movies. Hell, 28 Days Later was the first one I saw, and it failed to make a great impression on zombie movies as a whole. However, when I saw Dawn of the Dead earlier this year, I had a permanent respect for the genre. I have since seen the original Night of the Living Dead and plan to see Day of the Dead and the original Dawn of the Dead. Was I ready for a zombie spoof, though? I knew a few spoofs would go over my head, but Shaun of the Dead looked like a pretty funny movie, so why not? Plot: 1.4/2: Despite some people saying this movie uses zombies as backdrop, it is a zombie movie through and through. This isn't a romantic comedy with zombies, it's a zombie movie with romantic elements. That being said, Shaun does have a sufficient plot for a no-brainer zombie comedy. Shaun (Pegg) is a 29 year old loser. He works at a job with high-schoolers. His girlfriend Liz (Ashfield) dumped him because of him being unreliable. He is the constant mediator between his flatmates, the workaholic Pete (Serafinowicz) and useless, penniless Ed (Frost). He also sees his mother Barbara (Wilton) very rarely and hates his stepdad Phillip (Nighy). That's his life before it happens. It started a night after Shaun and Ed got wasted to forget about Liz. Shaun has set a goal to get Liz back, see his mother and set his life in order when Ed finds a girl moping around their backyard. When Ed and Shaun investigate, they find out she is trying to bite them and she can live through having a metal pole shoved through her stomach. Soon, a couple more like her arrive. They watch TV to find out that there is an epidemic of crazed behaviour. The attackers will not stop barbaric cannibalism unless their brain is neutralized. In other words, zombism. After finding that Pete has been bitten, Shaun and Ed make a plan to pick up Barbara and Liz, also ending up taking Phillip and Liz's flatmates, twat (that's the word they use) David (Moran) and failed actress Dianne (Davis). They decide the best place to hole up is Ed's favourite pub, the Winchester. The rest of the movie is what happens once they are in the Winchester. For a movie that combines the two genres (comedy and horror) that are often the most stupid, the plot of Shaun of the Dead is about as good as anyone could expect. It's not a twisty one, very linear, but simple enough to be an easy watch but not seem stupid.<br/><br/>Comedy: 1.8/2: This movie is British humour at it's best. Whether it's Ed's utter incompetence or Shaun's zombie denial, SotD is one funny movie. The only problem is it's not everyone's type of comedy. British comedy isn't for everyone. There is some bits that are really in-your-face, such as orchestrated zombie beating or the final newsreel montage, but there are many more subtle bits. Also, some of the bits are there for people who rewatch the movie to make connections, as there is a lot of foreshadowing that is hilarious the second time. If this is your type of comedy, this is your type of movie. With zombies. It also helps to have at least some knowledge of zombie movies, or else many references and spoofs will go over your head.<br/><br/>Horror: 1.6/2: For a movie based mainly on comedy, Shaun of the Dead is extremely gory. It is probably gorier than Kill Bill Volume Two or Dawn of the Dead, maybe even the Passion. As much as I like gore, it does not add much to the horror factor. While many scenes are frightening, Shaun doesn't attempt to be a horror movie out and out. The aforementioned scene involving an orchestrated zombie beating could have been scary as hell without pool cues and Queen. What it does attempt is done very well, so I give it credit here.<br/><br/>Acting: 1.9/2: I thought the acting was very good. Simon Pegg was a great Shaun. Moran, whom I've seen on Just for Laughs before, was excellent as David. And let's not forget Bill Nighy (Underworld) as the stepdad Phillip. Nick Frost didn't do an excellent job, but he was the scene stealer. Granted, any actor on a half-decent day could pull off that feat with the material he had. Another special mention to Penelope Wilton, who I thought played a great Barbara.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 1.7/2: It all depends if you like this type of humour. If you like British humour, even though this isn't as outlandish as Monty Python, you will like this. If you are a zombie movie fan, you will like this. Exclude those two things and this is not your type of movie.<br/><br/>Bonus +.1 for this: Ed plays none other than TimeSplitters 2 throughout the movie. I almost fell off my couch. For those who are non-gamers, TS2 is the best split-screen multiplayer game ever created (on this generation) and it's on all three major systems. Seeing this game here just made me smile. It's does have some zombies in it, so it's not completely out of place, but I would think something like Resident Evil would be more appropriate.<br/><br/>Total: 85%: Shaun of the Dead is simply hilarious, so I highly recommend it for those who like this kind of humour and mildly recommend for those who don't. It's also great for the gore aficionado on your list. It is one that I personally am going to buy, so it is one that I believed was good enough to own. See Shaun of the Dead."

So when you hear the term ""funny"" associated with ""zombie"" you think, ""Oh, it's a spoof."" Quite the opposite is true of Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>While one of the ambitions of the film makers is clearly to poke fun, it's not picking fun at zombie movies, but rather at society as a whole. They ask questions like ""How much would really change if the world was overtaken by zombies?"" and ""How long would it take the average guy to notice?"" With excellent performances from a virtually unknown cast and filmmakers who are driven by multiple viewings of George Romero's classics, Shaun of the Dead is an excellently good time from start to finish.

","George Romero's American homegrown zombie franchise - ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1969), ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978, and a somewhat tepid remake in 2004) and ""Day of the Dead"" (1981) - has spawned dozens of imitations, send-ups and downright rip-offs, but none as cleverly tongue-in-cheek as this new British entry.<br/><br/>Shaun is a disenfranchised Peter Pan, idling away the last moments of his twenties living with roommates, hanging out at his local pub, and working a menial retail job. He and his friends don't seem to notice the ever-growing army of reanimated flesh-eaters, instead being absorbed in their interpersonal relationships and romances. Only when circumstances grow dire and demand action do they reluctantly formulate a plan.<br/><br/>In addition to this display of large-scale apathy, the film boasts hilarious dialog, well-developed and competently acted characters, and literally hundreds of tips of the hat to George Romero's shambling remnants of Western civilization. For fans of the genre, I highly recommend this one."

","This movie, is hands down, hilarious. Not only that, its an amazing movie simply because, although it is categorized as a comedy, it cuts across several other genres and collaborates them beautifully. A comedy, a horror/zombie flick, an action movie, a drama, a brit-flick, and finally, believe it or not, a romantic comedy. (yes to everyone in the UK, a lot of us here actually consider a ""brit-flick"" a genre.) To put it this way: my girlfriend, who doesn't like bloody horror flicks, action flicks, or British movies, actually admitted she liked it, after I ""put her through it."" It incorporates all the elements of these categories and knows exactly when to bring out each. I agree with what another poster has said, that it is amazingly ""realistic"" for the kind of movie that it is. Meaning, the characters react to the situations the way normal people do, for the most part. There are no real ""heroes;"" Shaun himself does nothing truly amazing, except for be himself, and try his best to keep his loved ones alive. I could watch this movie again and again, and for me its rare to say that about a comedy."

","I never would have rented this film if it weren't for the Blockbuster gift card I received for Christmas. I am so glad that I did. I was surprised at my attachment to the characters towards the end, and I realized what a well-balanced split there was between character development and plot climax, humor and horror, love and sadness. The gore was conservative for what it could have been and didn't at all interfere with the flow or progress. The characters were believable, although they did quickly and gleefully take up the bloodlust necessary to dispatch zombies, they still acted in a reasonably disgusted manner. The comedy was superb although I sometimes felt that they were using that British accent to accentuate the comedy; if the same things were said with an American accent it wouldn't have been as funny. All the same, I laughed much more than I expected, and said ""This is great"" out loud more than once throughout the film. Plus, any film where two main characters sing Grandmaster Flash's ""White Lines"" would get a score of at least 7 from me, even if the rest of the movie was about a mute woman who teaches Harvey Keitel to play the piano."

","""You've got red on you"" is a clever bit of repeated dialog, and harbinger of things to come. 'The living dead': look closer for an analogy. Protagonist Shaun seems to exist in a dead world. As he rides the bus to work, we become aware of the masses of soul-dead people slogging to work. If Shaun's a loser, he's about to become a hero. Will he get the girl? Again?<br/><br/>Brilliant dialog, slapstick, and satire stylize this quirky comedy/horror flick. The editing is brilliant: flowing yet abrupt scene changes keep us on edge â€” along with the somewhat startling soundtrack. In the beginning of the film look for background scenes as characters manifest the onset of zombie metamorphoses. Note: film has shown us that zombies move extremely slowly, that they're not very bright and seem to be food-centric. Therein lie methods for coping with them.<br/><br/>I admit it: the so-called comedy/horror genre has long been a guilty pleasure of mine: An American Werewolf in London . . .

"shaofutzer","10","0","1","16 January 2005"," Much better than expected - in a word - Wonderful.
","Ahhhh the rare and oft misunderstood zombie-comedy genre at it's absolute best. I went into this movie hoping it would be awesome but expecting it to be drivel (not familiar with the sitcom Spaced at the time) but left with a feeling a movie has not given me since... Heck I don't even remember a movie making me feel quite like this. This is what a good movie is all about. It contains everything it needs and very little it doesn't (I.E. - ""You've got red on your shirt"" - was a little overused and not that funny). While understandably the occasional scene of dismemberment and foul mouthed cursing may turn away many comedy fans, this movie was not intended for those people. This movie was intended for people who could appreciate the humor in films such as Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive. What this movie does is escalate every good aspect of those aforementioned movies to a new degree that I feel will be difficult to surpass, launching it right up there with Monty Python and the Holy Grail as on of the best British comedic movies ever created - and quite possibly one of the best comic movies ever made regardless of nationality. While having a deep understanding of British culture helps, anyone with an IQ of over 100 should find this movie extremely entertaining. I nearly wet myself from laughing so hard throughout the movie although it does sort of drag near the end as everyone dies off, but it is miraculously saved by a heart-warming and very funny ending that couldn't have been done any better. It's upsetting that the movie didn't gross more in the states, although I'm sure once word of mouth gets around, DVD sales and rentals will pick up. I'm an extremely critical movie buff and this movie has permanently carved a notch in my top ten films of all time. If you're at all skeptical - don't be. If you're 13-60 (a very cool 60) you'll find something that will appeal to you in this movie, although I suspect its biggest fan base will be men in their 20's to early 30's. I cannot stress the importance of this film as it is now the king of all horror/comedy films. Even if the horror aspect doesn't appeal to you, the comedy is solid and if you don't find yourself laughing at least a few times throughout, then I seriously doubt you're even human. I give this the highest recommendation possible. It's a story about friendship, love, senseless violence, and gut-busting scenes of pure joy. Watch it and you'll know what mean."
"DarkSword","9","0","1","12 January 2005"," Really really bloody good! small spoilers!
","When i first saw the trailer for Shaun I thought it was a spoof but after watching it i realised that it is so so so much more. The film works on so many levels which is the main reason i like it so much. <br/><br/>On one level it is an excellent Zombie film with some of the best special effects in the genre. The zombies are perfect, the blood isn't over-kill or suggestive but a perfectly gory balance between horrific and subtle. With this, the climactic sequence is tense, scary and effective where it could have easily failed if it were helmed by another director. <br/><br/>Another level the film works at is it's fine grasp of comedy. Of course this is for many the main attraction and the Spaced comparisons are inevitable. Yes its like Spaced, No it isn't better but it isn't worse either. Where spaced was a surreal fanboy orientated sit-com, Shaun is a less-surreal fanboy orientated rom-com. Spaced wouldn't have worked as a film because it is written in episodes and is to hectic however, Shaun is set at a different pace with more realistic settings and characters. The fanboy homage's are still there, references to Raimi and Romero are excellently handled, but this time round Edger Wrights direction has matured and he has made his own style from his influences. Now rather than rip-off camera work we have subtle inserts which are fun for everyone and mean that little bit more to those in the know. <br/><br/>The film also showcases some fine scripting, performances and acting as well as some astonishing set pieces. There are spoofy moments such as the Queen/pool battle and the ambitious use of vinyl as a zombie deterrent but the film isn't just a spoof reel like Scary movie or Hot Shots. Shaun of the Dead is in it's own right a classic horror comedy. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's double act of Shaun and Ed is inspired and touching and even outdoes Tim and Mike their roles in Spaced. Nick Frost's Ed is so good because he is so real, he's such an honest portrayal of the best mate who you can't quite let go. He's also wonderfully politically incorrect with lines like ""wassup nigga's"" and ""alright........gay"" which could easily offend but don't because they are so effectively delivered there's no doubt that no harm is meant.<br/><br/>Overall Shaun of the Dead is bloody fantastic and I recommend it to all! I give it a nine out of Ten. It loses a point because I feel it slightly lacks the feeling of alienation and apocalyptic atmosphere of the Romero greats but is so effective never the less I don't really care."

","Shaun of The Dead is pretty mediocre flick in the beginning. I've seen so much of standard British sitcom humor, that it failed to impress. But once the zombies started causing havoc, the film became really funny and entertaining. It was cool to see the film not shying away from all the gore. Good throwback to the old days, when horror movies had some guts! It's pretty well directed with some cool camera angels and stuff like that. And I really liked the actors. Especially Shaun and Ed were really good.<br/><br/>The first 20-30 minutes are kinda boring, but it's really good after that. I would give the film ***/****."

But, having said that, this film is a very refreshing comedy-horror flick. It is like an updated Hammer House of Horror (though with fewer heaving breasts). There are a whole bunch of little visual jokes that really make this film, as well as the character interaction.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everyone over about 15. Yes there is quite a bit of comic violence, but what you just have to have it in this sort of flick. It was not a film that made me laugh out loud very often, but it definitely kept me entertained. I am just glad they did not remake it in the US (yet) with a baseball bat substituted for the cricket bat - although either would be equally effective!"

The joke factor was no more than so-so.<br/><br/>As usual with these movies, it's the characterization of the main characters that is the interesting part, and in this movie there were some nice elements of that, too, but it was a too obvious second-fiddle aspect, because ultimately everyone but the ""hero"" and his girl died.

","If you see only one zombie romantic comedy, this should be it. It's a perfect complement to (or substitute for, depending on your outlook) 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead, the two most recent zombie movies.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a salesman at a small electronics store. He lives with flatmates Ed (Nick Frost) and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and hangs out with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) at the local pub, the Winchester. Shaun's life is pretty stagnant at this point. He's 28 but directionless. Liz notices this problem and tells him to take a hike after Shaun bungles the reserving of a table for dinner. Dazed, Shaun gets drunk at the Winchester with Ed. It's not until after a few days of their bender that Shaun and Ed notice the walking dead.<br/><br/>The zombies are more or less a metaphor for Shaun's life to that point; that he's just drifting from experience to experience without actually making anything of himself. He likes Ed, but he can't rely on him as a friend (Ed is also jobless); no one else in his social circle can stand Ed. Liz's flatmates don't like Shaun too much, because they think he neglects her. But Shaun isn't dislikable, he's just not all that.. there.<br/><br/>The arrival of the living dead - their genesis is never explained, but it's moot - gives Shaun a chance to show he's not some senseless slacker who'd rather play video games or hang around in a pub. And it's at this point that the movie mirrors the earlier, more-serious zombie films, as he and his friends try to escape the clutches of the zombies.<br/><br/>Shaun's personality doesn't change drastically, however; it's not as if he's suddenly transformed into Indiana Jones. He makes mistakes, but one thing is certain - Shaun. He appears full of life and confidence, inspiring his followers to .. well, to follow.<br/><br/>Going from the promos, one would think this was full of nonstop laughs. Now, there were plenty of moments when I did laugh out loud, but a lot of the movie - especially the final 30 minutes or so - is fairly serious. Lighter than your usual run-of-the-mill living-dead movie, but not a hilarious film full of wacky hijinks. In some respect, that may have hurt the movie a little - people crack jokes when it seems more drama would be in order. And some of the characters are pretty darn unlikeable, and that never helps unless they're definitely the bad guys."

It's a comedy about the daily grind and about going life as a zombie, made for the sort of people who watch Zombie movies. While Shaun of the Dead doesn't contain the same sort of gore and trauma inducing splatter as either of the Dawn of the Dead movies, I would venture that if you didn't enjoy those, and if you didn't think that ""Idle hands"" was funny then you're not going to enjoy this one either.

I don't mind them, but I feel there is more fun to be had watching an American film such as ""South Park"" or ""The Naked Gun"". And then, along came Shaun of the Dead. My views were completely shifted. <br/><br/>First thing I've just got to say is what a film: you've simply GOT to see this and if you haven't already MAKE sure you rent it or even buy in the near future. It's tense, fun and so, so funny. One of the great things about the film is, although you may have seen these actors on T.V. elsewhere (i.e. The Office or Spaced) it's there first proper time acting on a set and they do so, so well, impeccably timing as if they'd being doing this for 25 years. Another great aspect is how they blend the different genres together: there's horror in the pub sounded out by bellowing laughs, there's romance beforehand topped off with utter stupidity. So really, this film is just one genre; it effortlessly manages to be about three or four. And it's done so damn well (the Garden scene is so outrageously funny!) Really, this is essential viewing and if you want to see arguably the funniest British comedy ever (that can be watched over and over again) then go anywhere you can to purchase this immediately.<br/><br/>Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)"
"accip_","10","0","1","7 January 2005"," Overall, very good despite starting slowly.

He's stuck in a dead end job, he needs to visit his Mum but his Stepdad (the ever brilliant Bill Nighy) is there, with his beloved Jaguar car and his house mate, Pete, is sick of Shaun's best friend, Ed. Then the dead start to come back to life.<br/><br/>The film starts slowly with his normal life, but gains speed halfway through. There are lots of good jokes at the beginning but soon there are less and less... But admittedly though there are less, the jokes towards the end of the film are generally better.<br/><br/>The zombies in this film are very good, with white eyes and visible wounds where they were attacked (when they were living) by zombies. By the way, you may not want to watch this (at least not some of it) if you are afraid of gore as you do see *some* people get ripped apart.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Shaun Of The Dead (which you most likely will!)

","I rented the DVD of SHAUN OF THE DEAD last night and found it very entertaining. The story is very clear and it moves at a brisk pace. Even though there are references galore to other movies, to TV shows and to the world of pop culture in general, the film makers obviously aren't using the references as a substitute for storytelling. The acting is very good; the characters are well-defined and there's a sense of reality in the midst of the unreality. While SHAUN OF THE DEAD refers often to George A. Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD, the two scenes with Shaun taking a trip to the store are reminiscent of Monty Python's skit A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A London STOCK BROKER. For a comedy to tip the hat so blithely to something so masterful is a bold move, but it works well. References to British pop personalities eluded me, but I don't think that's a flaw. It's helped me learn a little more about the UK. Two of the main characters look like Harry Potter and Britney Spears on a date, and that will make audiences laugh worldwide. The DVD itself is full of extras. There are two commentary tracks. One features the director and the star and the other features a bunch of the cast members. There are out-takes, flubbed lines and extended versions of peripheral bits seen on TV screens at different times in the movie. There is, in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD a moment when suddenly we're reminded of the actual horrors of the world at the time the movie was made. It's a brief moment and may not even have been intended as the jolt it always is; but it's part of what made that movie powerful. SHAUN OF THE DEAD has such a moment, equally brief. So, it's not just a comedy or a spoof. It's in a direct line with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD."

Showering, eating breakfast, going to work; it's all part of some chronic, tedious spiel. Eventually, we all become mindless zombies; following our habitual lives without even the slightest thought. The question is, what exactly would we do if our incessant worlds were turned upside-down? If for once, something different occurred? Well, according to Edgar Wright's Shaun Of The Dead, the answer to that question is simple; we'd laugh about it.<br/><br/>While poking fun at the British culture, and the faults of many perfunctory societies, Shaun Of The Dead acts as a campy English take on the recently stupefied horror genre. It starts out slow; setting the grounds for it's multi-layered characters and plot, then jests its way into an elongated, and quite riveting climax.<br/><br/>The movie follows the story of an oblivious slacker named Shaun {Simon Pegg} who's life falls apart when his girlfriend, Liz {Kate Ashfield}, dumps him due to his indolent nature. The next day, Shaun, and his half-witted best friend, Ed {Nick Frost}, awaken to find the world overrun by the cannibalistic undead. From here on out, the plot becomes an amusing, and largely witty piece of comedic satire as our heroes struggle to save Liz, her uptight roommates, and Shaun's mother, then reach a nearby pub where they plan to take refuge, and hopefully survive the night.<br/><br/>Unlike in most horror films where cardboard cutout characters run around getting chopped to pieces, survival and suspense in Shaun Of The Dead actually takes a backseat to character development, and, well, romance as Shaun uses the apocalypse to his advantage, and tries to win back Liz's heart. Heck, the movie's tag-line is even ""a romantic comedy, with zombies.""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though; even with its many affectionate, and comedic moments, Shaun Of The Dead also packs enough scares to get any horror fan excited. The balance between comedy and horror in this film is virtually flawless, acting largely as the movie's greatest achievement.<br/><br/>For example, during the last half-hour of this film, in which hoards of the undead finally invade our heroes' sanctuary {a pub}, initiating an action packed end-all battle for survival, people are impaled, ripped apart, and eaten as a jukebox plays quirky pop music, and ironically important fart jokes pop up into the atmosphere. One second you'll be smiling, and the next; your eyes will be scrunched closed in fear and disgust.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead is also very successful in it's constant mocking of the drudgingly humdrum aspects of society. Initially taunting only the British culture {it is a British film after all}, the movie ends up making fun of anyone, and everyone who can connect with the idea of being in a rut.<br/><br/>One scene in particular that emphasizes this point, and actually defines the tone of the movie as a whole, would be one in which Shaun wakes up, goes outside, walks to a local convenient store for breakfast, and goes back to his house, all without realizing that the city of London is up in chaos as hundreds of corpses and moaning, flesh-hungry zombies line the bloody streets. Obliviousness and laziness; these two things make society as a whole almost indistinguishable from the living dead.<br/><br/>All in all, Shaun Of The Dead is a smart, scary, hilarious, and horrifyingly witty satire that constantly teases the everyday lives of people across the globe. After reading this review, I suggest that you go out, find a cricket bat {or any blunt object for that matter}, get to a theater, and see this movie. Oh yeah, and one more thingAim for their heads.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5/5"
"london_mg","9","0","1","27 December 2004"," Ridiculously funny
","I nearly wet myself laughing when I watched this film. It already starts off promising, in a very oddly British kind of way, completely different from what I imagined. Shaun is this sad geezer, on the verge of losing his girlfriend who is stuck in a dead-end sales job and gets wound up by his 17 year-old colleagues. His best friend is even more of a loser than he is and doesn't do much apart from sitting around with his Playstation or downing pints at the local with Shaun etc. As the plot builds up we are gradually introduced to Shaun's cozy, yet boring world as well as realise way before he does that something very obviously ""iffy"" is going on and the scene where Shaun & Ed finally realise that they are dealing with zombies has got to be one of the most hilarious in the film. From that point on, Shaun the anti-hero and Ed, his side-kick become humanity's last hope, wellfor his loved ones anyway and both set off on a mission to save Shaun's ex-girlfriend and mother. What follows is a mixture of action, gore, a little romantic subplot and plenty of British humour. This is not really a film for those expecting homage to the original, but it does have references even in the way it's filmed. But it is mainly a ""comedy"" (not a spoof) and very good one at that with a brilliant set of characters, including Lucy Davis from the Office who plays Dianne. I also think that it's funny that they released at the same time as the remake of Dawn of the Dead because it shows that a little clever marketing, good actors and a good script can take on a big budget remake any day."

","In the ads for this film, it claims it is a ""Romantic comedy - with Zombies"" and I for one, couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>This film is, at the core a feature length ""Spaced"" episode (with a bit of good old cheap zombie gore and some silly predictable romance thrown in) and, as all the Spaced episodes were, extremely funny. It stars Simon Pegg (leading actor from spaced)who is always very funny in anything, but in this film he excels himself, he acts the part perfectly, with an almost Oscar winning performance.<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead is NOT I repeat NOT a spoof on zombie films, it is, as the makers say, a comedy, with zombies. The comedy has a small, well earned break whenever gore or certain scenes of disenbowlment and decapatation ocurr. This film, for all you film geeks out there, remains true to all the other zombie movies, and contains a certain amount of respect for them.<br/><br/>It is also very clever, its message is that we are already all zombies, the entire point of the film (apart from making anyone who sees it laugh there head of) is to make this comment on todays society. The film contains numerous witty quotes from other films. The actors all give brilliant performances, which makes an already sure fire classic, even better. 10/10"

","Hard to describe this as a horror film because it's rarely horrifying, but it's easy to describe it as successful because it has a very polished script and is smartly directed.<br/><br/>In a modern London suburb, a regular ""bloke"", who is having girlfriend troubles, begins to notice that his neighbors and colleagues are walking funny and talking like they have dirt in their mouths.<br/><br/>After dispatching a zombie girl with an expertly swung cricket bat, our hero does what we expect him to do -- he heads for the pub. On the way he meets plenty of dead people and a few live folks, too (not that there's much difference here, which is the whole point).<br/><br/>The encounters with the deadheads are inventive and marginally bloody, but mostly they're fun in a Monty Python kind of way.<br/><br/>Tongues are planted firmly in cheeks in this refreshingly unpretentious outing and famous zombie movies -- Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, in particular -- are referenced visually and musically.<br/><br/>Solid entertainment."

","Romantic comedy, zombies, humor? It would seem a strange combination, were it not for the fact that it was done by the same people who made ""Spaced"", one of the three best British sitcoms ever (the others being ""Father Ted"" and ""Black Books""). The TV series was great, I'm surprised a lot of people here didn't watch it. Anyway, the film is very funny, at the same time it is not a mere ""spoof"" of the genre, having realistic zombies (not that I ever saw one myself, but you know what I mean) and some moments that are almost scary. Good supporting cast too, I'd only like Jessica Stevenson to have a bigger role, she's funny. Too bad here (I lived in London, but I'm living in Brazil right now) they didn't release it in the cinemas, going directly to video/DVD.

Its a Love story, when Shuans only motivation for trying to save his family and friends stems for his love for Liz and his attempts to get back together with her. Shuan of the Dead works very well as an action film where the zombies storm the Winchester, while the survivors try and fend them off with Molitov Cocktails and a rifle.

","I am not a fan of horror films, and had never seen 'Spaced' , so I was a little apprehensive about going to see this. However, as a fan of Dawn Tinsley ('The Office') and of Dylan Moran, I thought that I would give it a go. Good decision. This was without a doubt the funniest film I have seen this year, and probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. It is hilarious from the first minute. Packed with jokes, some obvious and groan worthy, some quite subtle. I think this is one of those films where, each time I see it, I will spot another gag I didn't notice last time around. As well as being side-splittingly hilarious, it is action-packed, and there is a real sense of drama at some points. So that makes it a comedy-horror-buddy movie, with drama, action and violence, all revolving around a love-story. Has Simon Pegg missed a genre? I don't think so!There is something for everyone in this movie, and it is all done brilliantly. Don't go and watch this film with someone who embarrasses easily, as they will move away from you in the cinema and pretend they don't know you, just like my mate Pete did when we went!"

But later in the story, they will just came back in their habit. Shaun best living for happiness place is the Winchester, a pub. They didn't knew that the city was slowly infected by the virus. Some scenario here will make your lungs out of oxygen and your eyes was begging for water because of some non-stop laughs. Almost all of the time, expect that something funny will happen. Shaun is a little bit of a dumb, stupid person that instead of going a gun shop or police station, they'd went in to the pub because of only ONE!!! rifle.

I really haven't read other reviews so I do not know if anyone mentioned that this is actually a character driven comedy glued together with a zombie plot line.

It very much reminds me of 'An American Werewolf in London' in that it has the horror elements and great SFX used to tell a few other personal stories rather than truly attempt to frighten you. Not to say SOTD does not have its share of gore (I wouldn't let my 11 y/o see it) but it just is not scary gore.

","... worth a watch! In fact, I was crying with laughter at various points in the film at Pegg and Frost's hammy acting and witty one liners (the throwing of hands in the air scene as the first zombie enters their house had me in stitches, as did the discussion in the garden over which classic vinyl records they would throw at the zombies...)<br/><br/>I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"". It has comedy, traditional jumpy scenes when the zombies are after them and closing in, as well as some very poignant moments such as when Shaun's mother becomes ill. It is a light-hearted comedy horror, not to be taken seriously (let's face it, the gory effects are very basic), but it has a ""certain something"" that will probably appeal to most comedy horror fans. It's not cheesy like many Hollywood comedy B flick horrors. It's pragmatic, ironic, sarcastic and poignant all rolled into one, and the humour appeals to our very basic selfish self-preservation instincts and wants as opposed to needs.<br/><br/>Pegg and Frost compliment each other well, like many comedy duos before them, but the supporting cast also add to the intrinsic comedic value of the film."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","1 November 2004"," No more ""zed word"" for now
","Shaun of the Dead is an English send-up of the zombie genre which also evokes some of the climactic moments of such classics as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The paradox is that while the movie's saying the genre's kaputt, it's also showing how viable it still is, because its own main energy comes from standard zombie situations: the world gone mad, streets full of stumbling, hungry ghouls, people running out of places to hide; your mum getting bitten and 'turned' and having to shoot her. So the genre's like a zombie too: it dies here, but in dying comes back to fresh sinister life. <br/><br/>The initial joke is twofold. Shaun (co-author Simon Pegg) and his slob roommate Ed (Nick Frost) don't notice the 'zed' invasion at first because they're such lazy, incompetent slackers. But they also don't notice it simply because they're true Brits: English sangfroid is another thing keeping them from seeing anything gone wrong in the streets of North London. It's just bad form to notice other people's mess, even when that mess entails corpses in the street and blood all over the door of the convenience store fridge. When Shaun's stepfather's been bitten, since he's the steely Bill Nighy, the old boy keeps on making sense. What more can Shaun's mum do but make a nice cup o' tea? This is a hymn both to slacker virtue and to muddling through. <br/><br/>The filmmakers draw enough humor out of Shaun, Ed, their less friendly roommate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), Shaun's disappointed girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield), and Liz's self righteous best friends Dianne and David (Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran) to create solid scenes throughout where zombies aren't needed except as a buzzing, gurgling chorus outside the walls forcing the group to keep together and be brave. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is also the story of an underdog hero. Physically Shaun is like Vince (Craig Kelly) in the original English 'Queer As Folk,' but without quite Vince's level of charm. Like Vince, Shaun's shy, deferential, and not the most dashing guy around, but inside there's a plucky, reliable survivor just waiting to be let out. <br/><br/>For quite a while Shaun and Ed generate smiles with how despite constant radio and TV coverage they manage to disregard the zombie invasion in favor of electro music and video games. They've got to discover a girl ghoul in their own garden, which happens after an all night drunk to forget Liz's rejection of Shaun, before they finally get the picture. Their immediate reaction to the stumbling, menacing, staring creature is to think she's drunk too, but then the dead-fish eyes and bloody mouth are a tip-off. This is the best moment - when the first really horrible thing happens, but the pals are still arguing over which classic vinyl disk they can spare from their collection to bash out the zombie's brains with.<br/><br/>Once Shaun and Ed have joined the fray and Shaun turns into a hero, leading his little band to that center of English (and slacker) life, the local pub, the film becomes in many ways a standard zombie flick, except that it's a bit brighter and more character-driven. The ending looks just as conventionally apocalyptic as any of Romero's at first. But there's a sequel six month later, where Shaun and Liz have survived and live together (Ed and Pete got 'turned'), and remaining zombies have been kept around to be used for industrial jobs and certain sports. The unambitious day ending at the pub that defined Shaun is now Liz's idea of a good time too: through his heroism in defending the fortress of the Winchester, he has restated and reaffirmed English values as his own. Without the last good laugh of the postscript that turns zombies into a joke again where it was in the opening sequences, the movie would have succumbed to the genre it's offing. Instead zombie movies have been put to rest. For now. <br/><br/>This isn't a great film but it's a cheery one and more coherent than Danny Boyle's popular 28 days Later, which was all flash and no follow-through."

Obviously it's diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks, but to attack the toilet humour seems to me to have missed a clever use of a mainstay of classic British comedy. In SOTD they have taken a fart joke and used it to help define the relationship between the two 'buddies', and to lighten (!) the atmosphere in serious moments (like when Ed - oops best not say). I'm no fan of the fart joke, but this one isn't gratuitous, it's serving a purpose in the film.<br/><br/>Of course, it's possible the writers just find fart jokes funny, in which case, I take it all back!"

","i am an avid lover of independent films, and just about any film out of England or Ireland, so it's no great shocker that i rushed to the theater to see ""Shaun of the Dead"" on opening weekend (opening at least locally). i was prepared to be laugh, cry, say ""awwwwwwww"", and clutch fearfully at my husband's shirtsleeve. <br/><br/>i found the film to be terrifically funny on multiple levels, with just enough romance to even things out (i'm not big on the Ro-Com scene). The only thing lacking was actual fright. There were a couple of jump scenes, which got me probably as much because i expected to be afraid than because they were actually scary, and there was a good dose of gore, but not enough true suspense and horror for my taste (in a horror movie anyway). Everything from the title forward captivated my sense of humor, and i wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>If you like indies, if you like mixed genres, if you like British films, chances are you'll love ""Shaun of the Dead""."
"gpadillo","Null","0","1","19 October 2004"," Howlingly Hilarious and Original
","Shaun of the Dead is the funniest import from the Brits in years. Simon Pegg (who co-wrote the brilliant screenplay) gives a star turn as a desperate Everyman  a nice guy who seems destined always to finish last. Dumped by his girl, taken advantage of by his best mate, disrespected by his employees, (this is just for starters) Shaun is, at first, oblivious to the signs around him - that the dead have returned to life and these flesh eating bastards are hungry. <br/><br/>The prologue, if you will, where we see our first zombie, shows Shaun, still oblivious, offering his spare change. This is only the beginning. Hilarity ensues once Shaun springs into action with a plan to save (and win back) his girl Liz, save his mother and enlists the aid of his dim-witted mate, Ed. Of course the plan involves a retreat to the supposed safe haven of his favorite pub ""The Winchester""  named after the gun mounted above the bar, where Shaun has pretty much spent every drunken day of his adult life. <br/><br/>Problems develop along the way when, along with saving Mum, comes the miserable burden of having to save Shaun's detested stepfather. This same problem occurs when in saving Liz, her roommates (the ones who got her to break up with Shaun to begin with) also come along for the ride.<br/><br/>If this movie doesn't have you howling in laughter you may want to check your pulse . . . you're probably a zombie!<br/><br/>Edgar Wright strikes a nearly perfect balance between horror and humor and benefits from a cast that trust and wrap themselves around these characters.<br/><br/>Very highly recommended."

","This is a fantastic comedy that also happens to be a zombie film, brilliantly worked in together by the writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright to give us a movie with more depth than the premise suggests. It hinges around an excellent performance by Pegg in the title role, who makes the film believable whatever is happening on screen. The build of humour throughout the film means that the astonishing emotional power of the ending may take you by surprise, but go with it - because I promise you the film is worth it.

"AgentSmithOne","9","0","1","15 October 2004"," Leader of the zombie resurgence
","Shaun of the Dead (2004) is the best zombie movie ever made, and is leader of the zombie film resurgence of late. In the most recent years we have had Resident Evil (bad), Resident Evil 2 (worse), Dawn of the Dead (unresolved ending but good), 28 Days Later (mostly good), Bio-Zombie (good in a funnier, and Chinese, Night of the Living Dead way) and now, the cult jewel classic, Shaun of the Dead. Thank you guys that produced this film, you have answered prayers.<br/><br/>First off, this film begins as a comedy with some seriously kick butt montages where the camera zooms in and things happen in a quick succession. Shaun is a loser with no direction and loses his girlfriend. He continues on moaning and drinking, as usual, while hell has literally broken loose and he continues to gloss over most stuff in life like work until he can resume playing video games.Then he gets his act together to prove to his girlfriend that he will take control of his life. Then he and his mate, Ed (a total slob) leave his zombie infested house to retrieve his girl, Liz, and her knuckle head friends, and his mom. This movie has it all in terms of style, like I said earlier, the quick zoom montage and some cool tracks including a scene when they beat a zombie while grooving to Queen ""Don't Stop Me Now.""<br/><br/>The movie has a undeniable sense of reality and hopelessness then the greatest finish in the history of zombie films, much to the likes of the Resident Evil video game (much better than the RE movie). The ending involves Biohazard (Resident Evil props) militants blasting zombies, rage infected monkeys mentioned in a blip on the TV (28 Days Later props), and the naming of a Z-Day in remembrance (like D-Day in Normandy). Finally a zombie movie where everything turns out to be okay in that universe whereas other films such as Resident Evil and the new Dawn of the Dead turn out lonely and undead.<br/><br/>By the way, the zombie makeup rocked and I appreciate that this movie did not have the ""action movie"" feel such as RE and DOTD do where the zombies are relentless during outrageous explosions. 9/10"
"andyman618","10","0","1","14 October 2004"," Best zombie comedy ever!
","Shaun and Ed are two twenty-something slacker roommates. Shaun spends his days working, playing video games, and hanging out at the pub. Ed does pretty much the same thing, except for the working part. Shaun's world takes a turn for the worse when, sensing that their life is going nowhere, his girlfriend Liz breaks up with him. Then things really get bad when zombies start showing up in his neighborhood (and everywhere else).<br/><br/>Soon after realizing that The Dead Are Walking The Earth (nothing gets by these blokes), Shaun and Ed decide to rescue Shaun's mother and father (excuse me, that's step-father), Liz and her two roommates, and find a safe place to hole up, which turns out to be the pub, of course. In the course of this, they have to fend off zombies with everything from cricket bats to record albums. Predictably, things just go from bad to worse for the team.<br/><br/>Shaun Of The Dead is a rare creature: a film that effectively mixes humor and horror. I haven't seen a movie that does it this well since An American Werewolf In London. In the beginning there are lotsa laughs, giving way more and more to the horror elements as the film nears its conclusion. But even when things are at their most horrific this movie will surprise you with some hilarious bits. There are even a few moments that tug on the heartstrings a bit; something I hadn't expected at all.<br/><br/>Most of the performances are good, and the directing, camera-work and editing are all great. The brilliant script is filled with sharp-edged satire (many of the humans in the beginning are very zombie-like to begin with), and jokes aplenty. One of my favorite bits is when Shaun and Ed are fending off a couple of zombies with records from Shaun's collection, choosing only the bad ones to fling at the undead:<br/><br/>Ed: Purple Rain Shaun: No Ed: Stone Roses Shaun: Definitely not. Ed: Batman soundtrack? Shaun: Throw it.<br/><br/>If you have a strong stomach and a good sense of humor, you should see this movie, and soon."

","Shaun of the Dead was one of the most creative and one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. The laughs and action were almost non-stop (the movie drags a bit when they take shelter in the pub, but it's a brief lag).<br/><br/>With an original execution of a rather cliché premise, it was like a breath of fresh air. As a spoof of zombie movies, it succeeds. It's also the movie that ""Scary Movie"" could have been, and should have been.<br/><br/>A couple of scenes are very memorable. Most notably the scene where Shaun has to make an incredibly difficult choice concerning his mother. This scene was easily as gripping as the adrenaline shot scene in ""Pulp Fiction"". Also, the last few shots before the credits made me laugh like I haven't laughed in a while.<br/><br/>Much better than I expected. I'd gladly see it again."

","it's a farce in somewhat the same tradition as scary movie or naked gun; though more subtle and reserved. whereas scary movie and naked gun go completely over-the-top with their parodies of horror and detective films, shaun of the dead hams up some of the zombie movie conventions without going over-the-top. there are several nods to specific films in the genre as well. in one scene the two main characters are on the phone with ""barbara,"" who they tell to sit tight while they come over to save her. one of the characters yells into the phone ""we're coming to get you barbara!"" this is a reference to the first, great zombie flick ""night of the living dead"" in which one character is teasing barbra while in a cemetery - ""they're coming to get you bar-bra, they're coming to get you..."" the first quarter of the film sets the baseline. we see shaun waking up, going to the corner market, interacting with roommates and coworkers. it essentially poses the question: who are the zombies? this question is partially answered as the transition to zombie nation is made. just about everyone around shaun starts turning into a zombie and he doesn't even realize it. he's so rapt in thoughts of his own interior world that the exterior world is merely a place in which he wanders, rather than being an integral part of his daily interactions. that is, his own life is so monotonous and regimented, and he is so thoroughly ensconced in his own world that everything outside of him goes unnoticed. the question is answered fully during the film's denouement which is mostly a series of clips from news programs that recap the zombie episode and its aftermath. we also see that shaun's best friend (think brad pitt in true romance), who was earlier turned to a zombie, remains an avid video game player despite his zombie state; in other words, despite being a zombie, little has changed. of course all this is done in a funny way, versus the cutting social commentary of the original dawn of the dead. one thing that put me off a bit was the insertion of a couple heavy scenes in the film. there were a couple death scenes which i couldn't reconcile within the context of the rest of the film. usually farce films like this ham up the forced romance we see in these sorts of films, but shaun of the dead actually tried to play the romance and death story lines fairly straight. there were laughs before and after these islands of seriousness, but the laughs were generally outside of final goodbye or the ""we should be boyfriend and girlfriend again because i really love you"" scenes. the filmmakers either fell prey to the convention, felt they could get away with some touching moments, or i didn't pick up on the humor in these scenes. it's not that i'm opposed to serious moments in a comedy, but it felt misplaced in this film primarily because it's a film of farce and parody of the zombie genre. that minor quibble aside, the film was consistently funny and made with enough panache to keep it interesting throughout. oh, the two lead actors did a really good job and their apartment walls were filled with great music posters (funki porcini, amon tobin, saul williams, company flow, etc.) B."

Former ""Spaced"" co-collaborators Simon Pegg (who also plays the title character) and Edgar Wright treat us to their own homage to George A. Romero's Living Dead films, ably assisted by a likable cast. Basically, Shaun Of The Dead is what it says it is on the cover - a (very amusing) romantic comedy with zombies. One that manages to be scary and quite touching despite its non-serious approach. If it weren't for the gore (which we now have to accept as a necessity in zombie films) I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it without a doubt. Suffice to say the target audience won't care (and they'll love the soundtrack as well, I'm sure), but we've got to think of everyone here. That said, after having seen this I seriously believe that more British comedies should follow Pegg and Wright's approach. <br/><br/>(NOTE: The DVD contains many worthwhile extras.

","(Spoilers) Shaun Of The Dead has romantic comedy, a couple of touching scenes, and some laugh-out loud dialogue provided by Nick Frost as sloppy roommate Ed. And this all happens while killing/escaping zombies! Writer/star Simon Pegg has put together a good bit of familiar elements to make the most original film of 2004. Pegg stars as title character Shaun, a late 20's/early 30's-ish average joe who's happiest just grabbing a pint at the local pub, or playing video games with roommate Ed. He has a beautiful girlfriend and a loving mother, neither of which fit into that equation, and it's obvious that underachieving Shaun needs an occasion to rise to. So why not zombies? Pegg and director Edgar Wright begin the zombie scenario as a joke, but soon the atmosphere turns tense as Shaun & Ed decide to lead their group of survivors to the pub to hole up, and there the movie turns surprisingly VERY tense, while STILL holding on to its wit. The movie is more comedy than horror, to be sure, but you'll be surprised at the chills it provides. Highly recommended."

This really is a must see for fans of those films, and other splatter comedy films (eg. the 'Evil Dead' and 'Reanimator' series).<br/><br/>But what sets this movie apart from earlier films in this genre is the performance of Simon Pegg (as the eponymous Shaun). According to his profile on the BBC site (http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/profiles/simon_pegg.shtml), he used to be a stand-up comedian, and this really shows through in his performance. The timing and delivery of his one-liners are impeccable.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are spot on too.<br/><br/>And it's not just funny and gory - there are some surprisingly touching moments.<br/><br/>I gave it 8/10."

","Shaun of the Dead was a breath of fresh air. The air might have had a scent of rotting flesh but it was fresh. I have found that independent films since the introduction of Clerks have been superior to the main stream. The reason for this is that they do not get caught up in big name media centered ""stars"". Shaun is an enjoyable two hours with enough story alone to make it viewable. Ex. The first half-hour or so, you have a wonderful story about a man who has lost his grip on the corporate ladder, had his love line cut, and has a step-dad, all while the city is dying around him. That is what the tag line says, and that is what you get. ("" A romantic comedy, with zombies"")This story continues even after the realization of the zombies. Ex. Now that Shaun is starting to kill the ""un-dead"", or rekill the...dead again, anyway after he learns his new ""skill"" you can see his confidence rising, by learning ""kung-fu"". Oh yeah at one point he is spinning his legs to stand up, and using trampolines to jump over fences. So overall along with the supporting cast, and the lovable zombies, Shaun of the Dead is a great film. ""Aim for the Head"""

","I had a good time watching this movie. Shaun of the dead was a great spoof of the zombie movies and in turn resulted in being a good zombie movie itself. The first half of the movie concentrated on the comical side of the characters. Whether you're a fan of British humor or not I will find it hard to believe that a person will not laugh out loud at least once! I enjoyed the gradual change from the comedy to action horror, which I'll confess was much less horror than it was more gory. Look out for a very gory and graphic scene. I seldom look away from horror flicks, but in this one I had no choice. It was unexpected and disgusting, but understandably a must if one is too truly spoof a zombie film."

All the other actors are perfectly cast. Many people might be concerned that since the movie is English that they might not be able to ""get"" the humor. In fact, this movie could very well have been set in any city in the U.S. Shaun's everyday world is similar to any poor slob's who hasn't made much of his life in almost 30 years of living.

Shaun slips in the convenience store while buying a soda and doesn't realize that it is blood, but the audience caught it. The most sensitive moments build and then they make you laugh. The integrity of the main dude Shaun is fabulous. As they are escaping the first round of zombies, they hit someone with the car. Shaun stops and makes sure that the victim is okay / or a zombie before proceeding. The gore was just the right amount to add some drama.

Now Shaun of the Dead can easily be tossed up there with the best. <br/><br/>What troubles me is everyone calling it a satire or a spoof. It isn't satire. It deals with the zombies very seriously. It is a zombie movie. In the zombie movie sense it is fantastic. It also has plenty of comedy. Here's where people say it's really a comedy and not a horror movie. Who says horror can't have funny moments? Dead Alive was a spoof. Shaun is a legit zombie movie with a lot of comedy. A perfect mix of both genres.<br/><br/>Early on there is a lot of foreshadowing for the impending epidemic. This was handled so well, these guys are clearly fans of the classic. In fact the visual FX artist worked on Dead Alive. I'm glad to see someone sticks to the old school zombies. The modern ones are not what zombies should be. It makes them lose their charm. And it seems Romero is heading in the modern direction in hopes to start a new franchise that builds off of the originals. I hope he reinvents and not destroys the genre that he made famous.<br/><br/>You can't say Shaun of the Dead doesn't have enough horror. You can't say it's really a comedy.

","So we've had the Dead trilogy by George Romero-Night of the Living, Dawn of the, and Day of the. Since then, there haven't been many big zombie movies, save for the remakes of Night and Dawn. A Day remake is in the works. But last year we got 28 Days Later, a pretentious wanna-be zombie movie that I still enjoyed. But as a complete parody, we haven't really had any movies. That is, until Shaun of the Dead came around. It's a no-holds-barred comedy/horror, with some of the obvious social commentary that both Dawns had. But really, it's not even a spoof, just a zomromcom, as I believe the director wanted it to be called. And it's just what this world needs.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg, also the co-writer) is the senior salesperson at an electronic store at age 29. He lives with his roommates, slacker Ed (Nick Frost) and uptight Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). None are really going anywhere in life, and Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) just broke up with him. Then zombies start to walk the earth, and Shaun and Ed have to go and knock them zombies back to hell.<br/><br/>In the first 15 minutes, the movie gives off this bleak, uninviting vibe. The social satire is strong, but the laughs and excitement are not. Then soon after, the movie completely changes gears into this gory, hilarious send-up of not just zombie movies but horror movies in general. The body count is high, blood runs through like an erupting volcano, British accents are thick, yet it's a movie that you can't help liking. The humor is varied-from the dialogue, from the images, from the situations, from the parodies, from the effects, from just about anything. There's some great, memorable sequences in there, such as the hitting of the zombie with the pool cues, and the absurdity of the whole movie makes Shaun about equal to the Dead series. Maybe it will become part of the ""official"" series. But the whole cast has great chemistry (many have been on the British TV show Spaced), and the characters are just normal people. At times, an Office Space-ish vibe was given off. The character of Shaun was a likable guy and everything, and it's the normal people we relate to in these ""tense"" situations.<br/><br/>The entire parody was great, with a bunch of random jumps thrown in there for no reason whatsoever. I hate to say this about a zomromcom, but at times the atmosphere was pretty creepy. I wouldn't go so far as to call it scary, but for a comedy it was somewhat intense. The movie was well shot, with nothing unusual or any hand-held camera movements or anything of the like. Straightforward directing, by co-writer Edgar Wright, makes the movie watchable. Also, the acting was believable, and, at times, over-the-top (see Shaun's reactions when he first sees the zombies). But the nihilism of the Shaun character worked, especially when he walks through the town not realizing that everyone is a zombie. There's some crazy stuff happening here, and it's some of funniest stuff you'll see this year in theaters. Even if you don't like horror movies or blood-and-guts movies, I'd recommend it. You'll laugh no matter what.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for zombie violence/gore and language."

What follows is one of the most insane zombie fests I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The film starts off like a kind of dark romantic comedy, following the life of Shaun and Ed, his slacker friend. Shaun breaks up with his girlfriend Liz, and begins to drink his sorrows away at the pub. Then the zombies enter. In one particularly great scene, Shaun walks from his house to a convenience store and doesn't even notice that there are zombies all around him... because England is like that ALL THE TIME!<br/><br/>The writing in the movie is impeccable, definitely not what you would expect from typical zombie fare. Simon Pegg gives a terrific performance as Shaun, and the entire supporting cast is great. The film skirts on being hilarious and frightening, but for the most part it's just funny. Also, the violence (which is mostly impaling) is pretty non-graphic, which I think suits the film fine.<br/><br/>Horror nuts will love the countless referrences to other movies (""We're coming to get you, Barbara!""), but pretty much everyone will enjoy Shaun of the Dead.<br/><br/>The Final Cut:<br/><br/>Direction: B<br/><br/>The direction of the film isn't perfect, but it works just fine. I found the constant cutting to be pretty obnoxious, but you have to love the use of tracking shots.<br/><br/>Writing: A+<br/><br/>Probably the best script I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Acting: A-<br/><br/>Almost everyone is just fine.<br/><br/>Style: A<br/><br/>Completely original, totally off the wall.<br/><br/>Music: B<br/><br/>Nothing really special (but the scene with the LP's! CLASSIC!)<br/><br/>Overall: A-<br/><br/>You will probably like this film tons."

","A truly weird mix of zombie film and comedy that works mainly thanks to its funny parts.

The same goes for the acting.

","I was very impressed with Shaun of the Dead. It was very cleverly made, focusing on the characters and their interpersonal relationships instead of the whole Zombie situation was really quite unique to ""horror"". I really haven't seen a movie that made me feel that it was worth my time in quite a while! Now understand that we don't get movies over here in the states with humor such as this on a regular basis. Hopefully American comedy writers will start taking a turn towards more clever humor. I'm so tired of seeing comedy based on vulgarity and rampant stupidity, this was a VERY welcomed change. To all Zombie movie goers and comedy lovers, Shaun is a must see!"

","If this movie was 10 minutes shorter (or the same length but a bit more focused) it would have been one of the best zombie movies ever and definitely one of the best horror/comedies of all time... The comedy in the movie really brings the consequences of the zombie attack to the fore... The choices these characters are faced with are really brought to fore through laughter... Shaun is a great main character and the supporting cast is great except the somewhat annoying male friend of his girlfriend... His coworker at the store is good in both of his roles!! ;)<br/><br/>Overall this was a very enjoyable movie with one very good ""drunk"" sequence, likes of which we will not see in a long while :) 7/10 and could have been more!"
"lawprof","9","0","1","1 October 2004"," A Terrific Send-Up of a Dopey Genre
","I wouldn't, normally, go to a zombie flick even with a free offer of the now insanely high priced popcorn scooped out in Manhattan theaters. But director Edgar Wright (also co-writer) turned out a roaringly funny spoof of zombie films, also caricaturing many other genres. And it's all based on a true story.<br/><br/>Set in a working class London neighborhood (this film would have fallen as flat as a flatfooted guy's arches if made in the U.S.), the focus is on a small group of friends having the relationship problems that infest most sitcoms. Shaun (Simon Pegg, who also is co-writer) is an appliance salesman sharing a flat that earns the Most Slovenly Set Oscar with two guys. One is sick and tired of the third guy's belching, gas blasting, beer guzzling, video game obsessed mindlessness. That fellow is Ed (Nick Frost), the roommate from if not hell at least the end of the bar in a pub that doesn't care much who sidles up for a drink. But Shaun is his ever-loyal defender, his true-blue mate.<br/><br/>Shaun is, how original the idea, a forgetful suitor of Liz, a very peppery, pretty and fun character (Kate Ashfield). He can't even make a dinner reservation for a much anticipated, by Liz, romantic evening. Shaun does have a nice relationship with his mom but a less than ideal one with his stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy who was terrific in ""Love Actually"" and turns in a very good performance here).<br/><br/>Early on there seem to be a number of folks walking about the street who aren't feeling well. Public service announcements on the telly report a spreading flu. <br/><br/>Very soon Shaun and his set are besieged by hordes of extras, all beautifully made up to be homicidally weird but hardly frightening zombies. They add to their ranks by biting the dwindling number of healthy folks. Shaun and Liz, accompanied by Ed and another couple frantically seek to stay alive through a series of (mis)adventures that build up to a very funny denouement.<br/><br/>While, obviously, lampooning zombie flicks is the main theme, this director and cast set their sights on other very familiar screen staples including:<br/><br/>1) Guy must mature to keep gal who dumps him but really he's the only fellow in the world for her (of course).<br/><br/>2) Monty Pythonesque extreme silly violence with ample blood flow and many bitten and wrenched body parts. (Special effects here are quite good.)<br/><br/>3) Adversity brings out the hero in if not Everyman then at least our hero (Shaun).<br/><br/>4) Heroic ""I'm a goner but you gotta get out of here now"" scene.<br/><br/>5) The ever imperturbable English newscaster who reports horrific depredations by monsters with the same aplomb customarily employed to announce yet another aristocratic sex scandal.<br/><br/>6) Ingenuity in devising weapons.<br/><br/>And there's much more.<br/><br/>No one will be affrighted by ""Shaun of the Dead"" although those who found quick dismemberment in ""Monty Python"" off-putting probably won't like the heavy dose here.<br/><br/>Can't imagine what the special features will be on the DVD.:)<br/><br/>9/10"

","I was hopeful when I saw previews of ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but was a bit suspicious. Now that I've seen it, I'm happy to say that my concerns were unfounded. No doubt, this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. In fact, this was one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen. It matches both ""Dawn of the Dead"" in atmosphere and ""Return of the Living Dead"" in humor (and yes, I know ""Return of the Living Dead"" isn't part of the original trilogy... it's still my favorite film of all time though... well, it's now competing with ""Shaun of the Dead."") Those of you that have not seen (or are not fans of) the original ""Living Dead"" trilogy will be missing quite a bit, so I understand if you don't share this view. But for those of you that have seen and loved the original trilogy, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of horror films (and zombie films in particular), and this movie did not disappoint. The humor (which was distinctly British... not a bad thing) kept the audience rolling in the ailes. Wonderfully, the humor was thoughtful, creative and well-placed; I laughed until I cried, but never felt as though I'd been made a fool of.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there were a few slow parts in the film, and there are some decidedly ""thoughtful"" parts of the film that detract from the overall mirth, but the film as a whole is amazing.<br/><br/>The homages to that which came before and the new twists presented made this movie a perfect blend of comedy, horror, satire, and social commentary. Those of you that are fans of Sony's PlayStaion 2's hit ""Resident Evil: Outbreak"" should particularly enjoy the ""bar scenes."" Personally, I can't wait for the DVD release as I'm sure I didn't catch half of the 'trilogy gags' that were there. I'll be watching (and loving) this movie many times again."

","I saw this movie simply out of curiosity and the fact that the few previews I saw of it, made it out to be a great film. And it didn't prove me wrong. SHAUN OF THE DEAD was probably one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I was laughing all the way through the film and found the references to previous ""zombie"" films very humorous. Besides the jokes, which were some of the best/most creative ones I've seen in a long time, the romance was a nice and very different touch to such a film. This was the only aspect about the movie that prior to viewing it, couldn't understand how it tied into the movie without sticking out like a sore thumb. But I must say, it blended in wonderfully.<br/><br/>The horror/gore was kept at a nice level were it wasn't totally gross out, ""THAT'S SICK!"" blood and guts, but rather to the point where it got your attention and went a tad bit further. Great however, in the balancing of humor and gore so not to get one too into the film, but still at the same time laughing the whole thing off.<br/><br/>There was nothing wrong with the movie apart from being one of the most creative and hilarious films I've seen in a very long time. I would love a sequel...SHAUN OF THE DEAD AFTERNOON TEA anyone?"

","With the recent uprise of awful sitcoms here in the UK, it's nice to see that good British comedy isn't truly dead (arf!). Even better to see a good British comedy film that responds so well to our friends across the Atlantic (and one that credits neither Richard Curtis or Hugh Grant).<br/><br/>Having never watched the (apparently excellent) series ""Spaced"", and not being a massive fan of zombie movies, I wasn't really sure how I was going to respond to this.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I loved it. It may be a zombie film, but it's the hilarious dialogue and brilliant chemistry between the characters that warms the core of this movie. Crucially, the film maintains a suitable balance between drama and comedy at the right moments, and fortunately (unlike a lot of films in this genre) never plunges to ridiculousness.<br/><br/>The Wayans brothers could've learned a thing or two from this, had it come before the awful ""Scary Movie"" series.

","I enjoyed this movie. I don't tend to like any movie relating to zombies but the humor and total irreverance just sold me on this movie. Plus there is a message in the middle of all this about turning that curve into adulthood by the way you live your life instead of merely because your age says you are an adult. Many can identify with Shaun who is still stuck in the college mode and haven't quite turned that corner despite being a perfectly likable, good person. This also is more than just your zombie flick because of the British humor. As an American, it was a real treat to see this movie splashed with British eccentricities. I'm totally sold on a movie that is so clever that it diverts my attention from the gore. That's a truly successful movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

""Shaun"" will usually make you have this constant smile on your face as the jokes just keep coming. You get the sense that the creators of this zombie-fest wanted to get this right. Want to laugh? Want to have some dramatic scenes that help build character development so you actually care for actors? (trust me, you need this in a good movie) Do you want to be scared? And do you want to laugh? My, oh my does this deliver. For an added bonus for you hippies out there, see it high or sneak in a beer. You're going to love the next 1.5 hours of your life.

","A quick word. I really liked this movie. Was surprised it was as bloody and frightening as it was, wasn't expecting it to actually be a decent horror film, but thats certainly OK.<br/><br/>What I'd really like to point out however, and understand this isn't a slam, is that the zombies were not essential to the movie. They were mere plot devices. I imagine most people are thinking ""Not essential? It's a zombie movie! Of course it's essential!"" My point is, when you break it down, its not a zombie movie. To steal their tagline: It's a romantic comedy. With zombies. The movie is about Shaun and Liz's romance. The zombies are only there as a plot device. A catalyst.<br/><br/>That all taken care of, the movie really is great. I rank it up there with my all time favorites The Evil Dead Trilogy.

","Well known to British television audiences for the surreal comedy Spaced, co-writer Simon Pegg heads a top notch comedy cast for a film which manages to be both one of the funniest big screen comedies in years and a gory horror film which will satisfy any disciple of the splatter genre; indeed, this is probably the most satisfying amalgam of the two forms since the early films of Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson (the former gets several nods in the script, as - of course - does George Romero). British comedy fans will also spot a veritable ""who's who"" from recent hits in the supporting cast (Spaced, The Office, Black Books, Little Britain). If this movie leaves you cold, you might as well leave the pub and join the zombies."
"jbirtel","Null","0","1","29 September 2004"," What A Pleasant Surprise!
","I spotted ""Shaun..."" in the upcoming releases of IMDb and dismissed it for several weeks because of its lackluster (ok! I get it) title. Only after curiosity compelled me to click on some film critic reviews was I wowed by the response. Any zombie flick that results in so much positive feedback has to be worth a look.<br/><br/>And after looking, the good news is: that in spite of an (almost) slow beginning; and a laughless 15 minutes toward the end (but not THE END; which, in retrospect, could not (and) should not end ANY other way...it is FUU-UN-NY and Fitting); this has more belly laughs than any movie I've seen in years. It's sharp, clever and still manages to respectfully retain the horror element (if not so much the scary element). At no time during the movie did I slap my knees while cursing under my breath for the on screen characters to ""run faster"" or ""get out of there quicker""; instead I was reduced to a glob of jello with laughter BECAUSE the characters weren't ""running faster"" or ""getting out of there quicker"" (especially in the slow buildup scene that displays the dangers of 'child resistance car locks'). Not without flaws; there seemed to be too many times when flocks of zombies just stood there waiting (for what??) before the director gave the go-ahead to jump start their lunge toward their victims. But for comedy's sake, sometimes you don't mind.<br/><br/>Romero's original ""DEAD"" trilogy is THE thrilling fun and THE creme-de-la-creme in zombie horror. Why? oh why? did it take so long for another zombie movie, that's mostly a comedy, to FINALLY get it right, with characters that ARE right, for this genre<br/><br/>And Shaun and Ed make a wonderful comedy team with great on screen chemistry. That alone was worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Now, the faster ""Shaun of the Dead"" dies a quick death in America (no pun intended), the faster it can rise from the undead and into the realm of DVD. Sorry if it sounds selfish...but 'what the hell', I've already made room for it in my DVD library. So let's release it already! After all... the Brits got it. And there's still too many great movies made in Queenland that don't receive their due recognition in the states (so what else is new?).<br/><br/>As tempting as it is, no way, NO WAY am I spoiling anything of what happens. Too many reviews already gave away some very choice moments. For some reason, even knowing some of them did not ruin the belly laughs. I laughed just as hard anyway."

","This movie is very witty and clever and even though it hits it's satirical topics over and over a bit too much - it still is flat out funny and has some wonderful touches. The opening satire of many people going through life like a zombie is well done but then the director keeps going back to the well once too often - but the relationships are well drawn and Shaun is a perfect member of the ""lost"" late twenties generation. Nick Frost gives an excellent performance as his slacker best friend and it's great to see Tim Bevan - one of the stars of the hit BBC sitcom, The Office, put his TV money to good use. Bevan is one of the exceutive producers of the film and even makes a brief cameo. Overall, a little bit of gore, some chills but overall, just damn funny."
"hitch39","Null","0","1","28 September 2004"," If you're hungry for brains, this movie's got some.
","The concept seems like a horrible Hollywood pitch: living dead thriller meets goofy romantic comedy. However, Shaun of the Dead, Britain's deadpan answer to the resurgence of zombie movies like 28 Days Later and the new Dawn of the Dead is just that. And remarkably, it's funny as hell (pun fully intended).<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, who co-wrote, plays the titular Shaun; a protagonist content with the rut he's created for himself. This routine of video games and beer is no longer enough for his girlfriend Liz who tries to coax more out of the slacker. But, Shaun's relationship with Liz isn't the only one changing as Shaun's two dynamically opposed roommates play tug-of-war with him as well. The real trick behind this movie is the surprising depth of its characters as well as Wright's eye for comedy. Despite early warning signs, there's nary a zombie to be seen for the first thirty minutes of the film but chances are you'll be too busy laughing at the barrage of gags to notice. About halfway through, Shaun of the Dead shifts into typical blood-drenched, zombie mode with the band of lead characters crossing London to try and find a safer place to hide. Tensions flare up between the group as the zombies slowly penetrate their safe haven, but the comedy rarely wavers, with the exception of a few touching scenes that, because they're genuine, are more memorable than any of the gruesome violence. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the film knows how to give fans of both genres exactly what they want to see without being tempted by the clichÃ©s that would easily ruin such a precarious tightrope act. Could be I'm just a sucker for British comedy and zombie flicks, or it could be that this is the smartest movie in theaters right now."

","Shaun of the Dead is a British import, and apparently was a big hit overseas. It's tag line is ""A Romantic Comedy. With Zombies."" and I think that about sums the movie up. It's not necessarily a spoof on zombie movies like I had expected but a homage to George Romero and horror movies in general. In a recent Fangoria article, the director even admitted that the movie should take place in the same universe as the Romero trilogy of zombie flicks - and that this was a representation of what was happening in Great Britain at the same time. There is plenty of humor but at the core it's a love story. I think it's a great date movie actually if you and your loved one dig horror. I can't say it's my favorite zombie movie (Dawn of the Dead wins that honor) but it's one of my favorite comedies this year. It's just a good time at the movies, and if you hate hard-core horror this is a good alternative."

The comedic timing is impeccable, and it's full of small gags that keep you on your toes all the way through. The character themselves are a ridiculous bunch, have they each have their own certain charm and are incredibly lovable in little ways.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to any one looking for a great laugh.

","OK - first off, American here, though I LOVE British humor.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead has to be THE most inconsistent move I've ever seen. Its low points were so low, and so bad, that I actually mulled getting up and walking out of the theater, something I've never done, or even felt during a movie before. Its high points, however, were so funny, that they rank among the top ten of the funniest scenes/lines I've EVER seen in a movie.<br/><br/>HUH?!<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I can say that Shaun of the Dead starts slowly. PAINFULLY slowly, as if nobody would notice if they didn't really have an intro. The filler scenes which depict the theme of the movie were WAY too forced, as if the director and writer were making the movie for cretins. And then - the zombies start coming out, and there are some of the best scenes I've ever seen (in terms of humor, NOT horror) in a movie.<br/><br/>Then... it died. And died horribly. The movie, throughout its length, is part real zombie film, part spoof, part comedy, part British-situational/occupational-comedy, and the problem is that the parts not only didn't mesh, but as single units, they were awful. There were attempted jokes, most of them incredibly poor, and attempted British situational humor, the type of which nobody outside Britain would find funny. (and I LOVE British humor!)<br/><br/>And then... it resurrected itself! The ending was brilliant. Again, some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a film. Just... stunning.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead is two movies, one with a rating of 5, and one with a rating of 10, violently fused together. It should not be missed, nor should it be watched, as a whole."

It simply doesn't know what it is.""<br/><br/>Ummmm why exactly is this movies inability to be shoved into one tiny little category a bad thing? I loved the movie because it was not a standard comedy, or a standard horror film, or standard anything. It has the absurd, the painfully mundane, the scary, the sad, the touching, and all that all in one and that is the only reason this movie works. <br/><br/>I think it knew what it was. It was entertainment with some social commentary thrown in without taking itself too seriously ever. No more no less. <br/><br/>It's a good movie, but if you want ""Dumb and Dumber."" or ""28 Days Later"" or ""Harold and Kumar"" this isn't it. It's not a ""Laugh-a-minute"" movie nor, judging by the audience with me, that scary a movie. But that's good. <br/><br/>I think it's worth the time to see it, though I'm not sure I'd say it's worth the price of a movie theater admission at anything other than the afternoon prices. Not that it's bad, just I don't think seeing it on the big screen is going to add that much more than seeing it on the TV.<br/><br/>But it is good, and I think most people will enjoy it."

Still, they bring both and all together must fight off armies of zombies. <br/><br/>Shaun comes up with a plan to bring the rest of the living to his favorite local spot, The Winchester. A local bar and both Ed's and Shaun's favorite hideout. Now it has become a sanctuary that may save the survivors. Holding the zombies off with nothing but a rifle and a few nitnacks, there's not much hope. <br/><br/>After all, all that stands in their way are a hundred hordes of the flesh eating undead that have straight from the fiery pits of hell craving the flesh of the living and will stop at nothing to get what they want. Like that'll stop them a drunk, a loser, and a couple regular old' citizens.... right?<br/><br/>The tagline for the film is ""A romantic comedy. With zombies."" That seems to pretty much spell out this film. It's the best film I've seen in theaters all year. The movie is a riot. Apart from Bad Santa, it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. And I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I don't know what to call it. <br/><br/>The movie is also the bloodiest, most goriest zombie flick I've seen since ""Day of the Dead"". Which is my favorite zombie flick. Well, next to Shaun of the Dead of course. There is one particular scene when a character is literally torn to pieces. And my mouth was literally wide open. I was in disbelief at what I was seeing. Myself, and a friend caught an advanced screening of Shaun of the Dead and we both loved it. <br/><br/>This is best movie I've all year. A pleasant surprise that it didn't suck. It at first appears to a spoof, but it is definitely not. It works as a zombie movie, a comedy, and a romantic comedy. To me it's basically Love Actually meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dumb and Dumber. It's a perfect blend of horror and comedy. A good portion of scenes made me jump. Some horror movies don't manage to do that.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of zombie movies, this one takes the cake. I loved the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Awesome suspense, even some scary parts. But this just rules over any other zombie movie. The original Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Zombi, Day of the Dead, they are all classics. And I know that Shaun of the Dead will soon become as popularly and as respected as those.<br/><br/>I feel lucky that my teacher, yes a teacher, gave me two tickets to an advance screening to see this movie, because it doesn't looks like it's going to be put into very many theaters. And I don't think it'll do too well at the box office. Being a huge movie fanatic, this was a rare treat to see an advance screening. This was my first, and even better. The movie rules. This is now of the all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>I thought that zombie movies were dead. Boy was I wrong. Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil, 28 Days Later (which I did not enjoy), and now Shaun of the Dead. These movies are just as alive as they were back in the days of The Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I can't wait till the next zombie movie arrives. Hopefully a remake of Day of the Dead is in order. Or another George Romero gorefest.<br/><br/>Either way, it just goes to show that zombie flicks are anything but dead. I've never met a zombie I didn't like. By that I mean zombie movies seem to always rule. Return of the Living Dead was quite entertaining. Not too bloody though. The remake of Night of the Living Dead was another excellent zombie flick. However, the Return of the Living Dead sequels aren't as good as the original or any other zombie movie for that matter.<br/><br/>I certainly didn't expect this to suck, it just was a whole lot better than I could have imagined. It was incredibly gory, bloody, so much swearing, (When English people swear it's funny), hilarious zombie movie with a lot of heart and soul. You don't need to be a fan of zombie flicks to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>****/****"
"KillerCadugen","9","0","1","26 September 2004"," A gem of modern horror
","SPOILERS AHEAD - All too often these so-called 'humorous' horror movies tend to be more ridiculous than anything else, but 'Shaun of the Dead' is a brilliant piece of movie-making. While the horror elements are really strong (although the movie is really not all that scary, I will remember that one disemboweling scene for a long time) the humor is what makes the movie. Like in the original 'Dawn of the Dead,' the social commentary is so right on the nose you can't help but laugh. Shaun and Ed spend a day or so completely oblivious to the horror that is going on outside and I was laughing because I know people just like that, people who wouldn't know there were riots in the streets because they would be too busy playing Playstation or something. Something else I enjoyed were the subtle references to 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Dawn of the Dead' (like some of the chords in the opening sequence that were reminiscent of 'Dawn' and when Ed said into the phone 'We're coming to get you Barbara!'). A superb movie, it will find a place in my heart right next to another humorous horror movie - 'Tremors.'"
"hoelo","10","0","1","24 September 2004"," This movie was GREAT but can we please stop this US vs UK argument..
","My review of the movie itself is pretty short for the sole reason that every time I start to talk about this movie to anyone, I can't help but want to reference scenes that aren't quite spoilers, but I know I would rather have be a complete surprise to me. This is one of those movies that I was glad I knew very little about (other than the trailer looking hilarious) before I went in.<br/><br/>Simply put, this movie was GREAT. The closest parallel I can think of is Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness, not from any similarities in plot/structure/etc, but simply for the fact that the movie is both a strong comedy AND a strong horror. I was very surprised that it was able to pull off both so effectively. <br/><br/>On the comedy angle, the trailer almost doesn't do justice to the film. Sure there are a few things you've seen, but this movie hits you with joke after joke after joke. I am positive that the second time around, I am going to pick up on a lot of things that I completely missed the first time. There are subtle jokes all over the film (AFTER you see it, check out the IMDb trivia and look at everything you missed.. I was amazed).<br/><br/>On the horror angle, I was very surprised. While the movie is definitely a comedy were I to have to pick only one genre, it has all the chaos and gore of an Evil Dead, 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, etc. In fact, there are a few scenes fairly late in the movie that are downright disturbing. This, for me at least, was largely because they blindsided me. I was laughing along with the movie and trying to not miss jokes while laughing when suddenly the zombies do something unspeakable to one of the characters and your laugh turns to ""Ha haaaaohhhh damn!!!"".. <br/><br/>Yet the movie will follow one of those scenes with something hilarious literally seconds later, often playing upon the very fact that the horrific action happened. There is fun-gore, disturbing-gore (one particular scene.. all I'll say is.. Winchester.. Guy with glasses.. Window.. damn), slapstick silliness, very dry humor, situational humor (of which the characters are often completely unaware), raunchy jokes, and even a few scenes that make you, dare I say it... sad!<br/><br/>This is what makes this movie so great.. It is a roller-coaster ride that never takes you too far in any one direction. If you are a fan of much of any British comedy and like horror movies, don't miss this..<br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>A word, though, about this idiotic argument that is going on on IMDb about ""Will US people get the jokes?"".. This is quite possibly the dumbest argument I have been witness to in the past 10 years. Not to mention, the level of insults, stereotyping and inflamed jingoism (about things that have nothing to do with this movie) is simply baffling to me.<br/><br/>First of all.. It's a freaking movie! Are people really so angry in life that you can't just turn off the outside world for a while and go watch a movie and maybe, just maybe, remember that we're all pretty much the same people despite our political differences?<br/><br/>The argument itself is ridiculous given that it relies on stereotyping to support it. ""British Humor""? ""American Humor""? Rubbish! Bollocks! (my apologies to my UK friends if I spelled that wrong hehe).. I've watched comedies of all sorts my whole life, including a ton of British comedies (Are you Being Served, Yes Minister, Fawlty Towers, Red Dwarf, Monty Python (duh), Black Adder, Mr Bean, etc etc etc).. The idea that there is a general line you can draw through ""British Comedy"" is ridiculous.. There's the range of dry-wit to falling-down slapstick just like everyone else.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling.. But seriously people.. Get over yourselves and learn to laugh more!!"
"shpoodog","10","0","1","25 September 2004"," I was not disappointed!
","I'll try to keep this spoiler free, but there might be some minor ones ahead.<br/><br/>As a zombie nut and a casual fan of English humor, I've been waiting Shaun to hit the US since before it's UK release back in April. I hadn't watched a movie in theaters since 1999, but I held out and did not view the internet captures or the bootlegs that were out over the summer. I wanted to see this one in the theaters and had high hopes.<br/><br/>On Thursday, I caught an advanced screening, and Shaun of the Dead delivered! As a zombie fan, I dug the nods to other zombie movies that popped up throughout the movie and the use of the Goblin soundtrack from Dawn of the Dead. The scene where Shaun and Ed finally notice that the dead are walking is hilarious, and the reactions to the zombies were well done in a human and dead pan manner. I'll just say that I agree with a lot of people who have said that this is right up there with Romero's trilogy and is the best zombie movie I have seen since at least the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead.<br/><br/>The rest of the audience enjoyed the movie, and laughed in many of the same spots I did, so it wasn't just me.<br/><br/>I'll probably see this one again before it hits DVD in the states, and I recommend anyone else to give Shaun of the Dead a view."

","I went into this movie with insanely high expectations, and every time that happens, the movie has sucked, hardcore. But, this movie was an exception. This is ""one of the goriest fright films ever made"" (to steal the quote from the Dead Alive DVD box, but i think this one takes the cake).<br/><br/>The movie has just enough plot for you to not be sitting there going "" What the hell is happening?"" and plenty gore to keep all those slasher film purists at bay. <br/><br/>Shaun is one of the most dynamic characters in comedic history, he actually has more than one dimension, and he is a great farce of a character.<br/><br/>Honestly, i think that the new idea of fusing horror flicks and comedies is genius, and this is the best example i've ever seen of this genre. (Better than all the craptacular chucky movies) <br/><br/>I think that Simon Pegg is probably one of the greatest farce writers I've wiitnessed, maybe even surpassing Niel Simon. <br/><br/>Overall, 9.5/10."

","I missed Shaun Of The Dead at the cinema. Waited to see it but just couldn't find the time. Same as the new version of Dawn Of The Dead. Too many engagements to get there. I remember going to see George A Romero's version at my local cinema about 8 times before it was taken off. I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen, and just loved the blood and guts of it. We used to walk through our local shopping centre afterwards and imagine all those shoppers turning into zombies and how we would barricade ourselves in the local Marks and Spencers until the trouble was over. (at least we would not starve on the good grub in the food hall!)<br/><br/>So Shaun Of The Dead would have been right up my street. I really enjoyed 28 days later, and the resurgence of the good old Zombie movie was like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>So what do I think of Shaun Of The Dead? I think it is absolutely superb. A great British zombie movie to live with the best. Fun, exciting, and it still makes you jump in places.<br/><br/>I am not going into the plot, as this has been expressed by others on numerous occasions. Just sit back and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Some have said that Americans won't get the humour. I disagree. A twat is a twat in any language!<br/><br/>Pegg and Frost are superb as the main characters, ably supported by some very good British actors, including Bill Nighy (who should have had more screen time)and the sweet Lucy Davis from The Office. (Baby Carrot)<br/><br/>I have grown up watching the same movies as Pegg and Wright. In fact I live in the same town as where Wright comes from. Could have bumped into him down at Poole Quay!If I see him or Pegg down there I will buy them a pint for entertaining me for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Go see it. excellent entertainment.

"darenwheeler","Null","0","1","24 September 2004"," Bit of a surprise.. (SPOILERS)
","Don't let the trailer fool you. This is not a comedy horror, it's a horror comedy. In other words it's a horror film that makes you laugh rather than the other way round. In fact there are some moments where you actually feel uneasy. SPOILER: There's the part where Shaun's best mate buys it and Shaun's left in the cellar with seemingly no way out. You find yourself wondering where the ""And then I woke up"" part kicks in as surely no comedy film would have a main character killed off?<br/><br/>There are parts that are genuinely quite creepy but more importantly there's a lot of subtle comedy that you just wouldn't associate with a Zombie-Comedy. Watching the opening sections were Shaun goes to work/ the shops and then watching the same route but Zombiefied, you notice a subtle change to the background events.<br/><br/>All in all it's a helluva lot better than you'd think. 8/10"

","To me, the thing that set this movie apart from most is that I was laughing the whole way through. As a movie from the UK, the witty humor was a refreshing change from the norm (i.e. sex jokes) and was able to get the same reaction while being much cleaner.<br/><br/>The movie is about Shaun, normal guy in his late twenties. He's not really respected, doesn't really ever do anything, just sits on his sofa most of the time and does nothing. But when people start turning into zombies, Shaun realizes that he has to do something and save the people he cares about.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, Shaun Of The Dead was absolutely hilarious, and is worth seeing. If you like other British comedies (i.e. Monty Python, Guy Richie, Fawlty Towers) then this movie is definitely for you."
"film-critic","Null","0","1","26 September 2004"," It's been a funny sort of day,hasn't it?
","It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film. Normally, when this happens we end up with something like the Chucky series. It began serious, but after seeing the new preview, I know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror. I was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction, but then I remembered Â… this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny. As I was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end, I couldn't help but wonder why America has not been able to master this style of film yet. Why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes? While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based. 'If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes' style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.<br/><br/>With its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity. It takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act. That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film. I was there, sitting in the theater, knowing that it was a zombie film (still, can I call it that?), and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background. My eyes were focused directly on our star and scene-stealer duo, Shaun and Ed. One of my favorite scenes of this film is when Shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around. How many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anything-different happening in our daily routine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions. I couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>What also made this film work on every level was the cast. Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters. They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy. He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film. That is another great aspect of this film. It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment. So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds. This wasn't happening in this film. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, so I couldn't play favorites. All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.<br/><br/>I would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film. It is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up. I know that sounds strange, but you will get used to it American viewers. I mention that it is still a zombie film because I do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof. While it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films, this film stands on its own two feet. It had blood, it has violence, and it has those infamous scenes of people's heads being blown apart. That is why we see zombie films. <br/><br/>Overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you. I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","There wasn't much of a crowd in the theater when I saw this, but both me and my girlfriend loved this. I don't think that the rest of the audience understood most of the humor. This movie works very well for people who are familiar with the sub-genre of Living Dead movies. The story starts a little slowly, and even after it's clear to the main characters that they're dealing with a large problem, the movie doesn't jump into action. Even if you are familiar with all of the appropriate movies, the accents might put you off. If you have a history of disliking accents, then this isn't for you. Although I've only seen this once, I know that I'll buy this once a region 1 disk becomes available. No Living Dead collection is complete without this."

The only one that really springs to mind is that due to the mixing of genres, the pacing seems a little off at first... But this was not even a concern upon repeat viewing.<br/><br/>I can imagine very few people not enjoying this film. <br/><br/>Can a hit movie still become a cult classic? <br/><br/>Whatever this movie's fate, it's sure to endear itself to whoever happens upon it."

This is destined to be a cult classic. One of the greatest scenes is Shaun walking through town on his daily routine not realizing he is surrounded by zombies. He just doesn't notice. It really does look at this situation from your everyman point of view. What if this did happen? Would you be ready with a plan? Would you have the stuff to survive? Where would you go?

Shawn was a very good movie. It was strange in that I laughed and was scared all in one movie. I liked Shawn and really felt for him. The special effects of the movie were very good and I thought there was more gore, blood, guts etc...than some of the scenes in Dawn of the Dead.

I wasn't disappointed. Shaun of The Dead is a winner on two levels. Firstly as a parody of the zombie genre and secondly as a homage. I only hope they don't attempt a sequel, which must be tempting given the success of the film, as this would clearly be more of the same and would cheapen the original in my eyes.

When I heard that ""Shaun of the Dead"" was coming to American theaters, I was very excited and could not wait to see this movie.<br/><br/>""Shaun of the Dead"" advertises itself as a romantic comedy....with zombies. Shaun has all the elements of American comedies in it's first act. A great deal of the comedy is how Shaun and his friend, Ed, are unaware of what is happening around them since everything seems so routine. The movie basically pokes fun at how most of us are just zombies ourselves; going through the same routines day after day. While the beginning of the movie is a comic fest, the second half of the movie is all horror with small touches of humor intertwined. The last part of the movie is a true zombie film with all the horrors of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""28 Days"" combined. <br/><br/>I was glad that a friend warned me about some of the horror scenes before I had seen the movie. Why? Because I would have been under the impression it was a zombie spoof and had taken my eight year old niece to see this movie.

","I'm a simple guy and this is a simple movie, therefore I can get into this film without feeling ashamed. We've got a few simple characters in a simple town filled with simple zombies just trying to eat some flesh. Simply put this smart British spoof of Dawn of the Dead has more class and style than we've seen come out of any Hollywood scary movie.<br/><br/>Shaun's having himself an early mid-life crisis and he's so wrapped up in his own problems that he hardly notices that his town's being overrun by flesh eating zombies. When he and his flat-mate Ed finally clue into the recent apocalypse they slightly spring into action, attempting to save Shaun's mom Barbara, girlfriend Liz and hole up in the local tavern. Of course things get complicated with Shaun's step-dad, Liz and her friends and an increasing mass of slow-moving and persistent zombie horde.<br/><br/>For a discriminating yet simple movie-goer such as myself, there's just so much to like in this movie. An amiable ""regular Joe"" main character you can identify with, a flatulent foul speaking sidekick, a genuinely sweet girlfriend seeking to advance their relationship, a cheerful mom and, of course, some zombie smashing action with cricket bat and shovel. Throw in a few hilarious cuts from action to inaction, brilliance to idiocy and really, there's not much more you can ask for in a movie. There's little in the way of actual scares but there just didn't need to be. Although not stupidly naive about the situation, these characters deal with the crisis in a light hearted but task oriented way. Mind you they don't always think ahead.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you like British humor and an extra mild serving zombie frights you owe it to yourself to be entertained by Shaun of the Dead."

","I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Shaun of the Dead is a great film. It's funny, scary, and most of all just a great time to be had. If you're a fan of horror/zombie flicks, I highly recommend it (especially if you're one of the Dawn of the Dead/Romero lot, as I am, and sick of cheap rips at zombie horror like RE:A and Cabin Fever). I can't really say enough good things about Shaun, but there is one problem... it's too damn short. I guess it's just like any good thing, you'll leave wanting more. I don't think it takes away from Shaun, but the movie really had me craving more laughs and definitely more locales. Great film though, go see it and you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I loved this movie! I'm a big zombie fan and I appreciated the return to slow-moving, prosthetic-laden, dangerous zombies. None of that fancy CGI, running/choppy editing stuff for me. I adored all of the in-jokes to past horror classics, like Night of the Living Dead. But the humor was way more than in-jokes. There's a clever Morrisey cameo, a bit with old LPs, and many, many more. I worry when people say the humor is too British, but I think it translates just fine. There was maybe one joke that Americans, like myself, couldn't get. Something to do with ice cream. But one joke out of many...not a huge loss. Slackers are pretty much the same the world over.<br/><br/>What really stuck with me about this movie was the fantastic characters. Simon Pegg is a great comedic actor - his timing and facial expressions are just spot-on. He's a charming hero that audiences will cheer for. And you will cheer for Shaun and his best buddy Ed. <br/><br/>This is the best romantic comedy with zombies since ""Dead Alive,"" Peter Jackson's best horror film. That's a bold statement, but it's true. ""Shaun"" is quirky fun with a few scares and tons of laughs. I'd definitely watch this again and again."
"hoax-3","10","0","1","21 September 2004"," Best Zombie Film Since Braindead
","This film is incredible. It's both hilarious and scary and actually pulls it off just like Braindead did 12 years before. Except Shaun of the Dead is way way funnier. Thankfully they didn't forget about scares and reduce it to a Army of Darkness level though. <br/><br/>Shaun is a down on his luck guy with not much going his way. His girlfriend dumped him, he's in a dead-end job and although being a complete mommys boy he doesn't get along with her husband at all. And now on top of all that he's got an entire town of zombies to battle. <br/><br/>This plot just leaves everything open for as much classic British comedy as possible. I haven't laughed this hard since Monty Python and the Holy Grail. From trying to pass as zombies using Dire Straights records as weapons the laughs absolutely seep from this classic British film.<br/><br/>You might be thinking this sounds like it coulden't possibly have much gore in it and I pretty much thought the same thing. But I was pleasantly surprised at some of the bloody kills in it. Especially one that rivaled Day of the Dead of messes but you'll just have to see the film to find out what it is. But oh course the gore doesn't reach a Braindead level as the main emphasis is on the laughs but that doesn't mean gore hounds won't be pleased. <br/><br/>The comic acting is top notch as most of the actors come from the British comedy scene. The direction is really well made as well, there isn't any cheap Hollywood shaky filming it's all clear but fast and works perfectly in the action scenes. A few of the scenes were great homages to the Romero trilogy and that only improved on an already great film. It's not one to be forgotten and it's definitely one I'll be getting on DVD as soon as it comes out. So go and see it and get ready for a good laugh and a good scare."

As many laughs as the Evil Dead trilogy. Some awesome gore. And, most surprisingly, amazing performances. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the standouts as Shaun and Ed, two dimwitted losers that become unlikely heroes when a zombie plague ravages England. If you're thinking 28 Days Later sounds very similar, that's where the similarities end. Shaun becomes determined to save his ex-girlfriend (Liz) and his mother while trying to win back the former's love. A movie with both humor and heart, Shaun of the Dead is just amazing on so many levels. It has a killer soundtrack, some side-splitting laughs, references a million different zombie classics, and most surprisingly, plausible dramatic and touching moments. Wheras most zombie movies have the typical yelling/crying/whatever, this one really works. These people can really act.

","I liken seeing Shaun of the Dead to a life-changing experience - you'll never look at zombies movies the same way again. Following right in the footsteps of such esteemed flicks as Evil Dead 2 and Brain Dead, Shaun of the Dead tells the story of loser Shaun, his nagging girlfriend, his even bigger loser friend and flatmate, and the rest of his friends and family as he stumbles through a zombie outbreak, at times literally. The humor ranges from broad (leafing through albums to decide which are low enough quality to be thrown at advancing zombies' heads) to more subtle touches(As Shaun sits on the bus and observes a pedestrian mysteriously collapse, the passenger behind him plays the techno song Zombie Nation.)The pace is quick, the gore is more than acceptable, and the jokes never misses a beat.

But Pegg & Wright have cooked up an affectionate homage to (not a parody of) Zombie movies, including making some nice social satire comments. Yes, the movie also - bravely, but successfully - has sudden bursts of moving drama. Is this really too much to accept in a horror or comedy movie where some great characters have been created? That you should find yourself caring even more about what is going on? If this is too much to cope with, stick with the 'Scary Movie' series - SOTD is much better quality stuff.

","Before viewing ""Shaun of the Dead"", I considered Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"" to be the best film in the continuing year of 2004 [USA release year]. Now I am not too sure.<br/><br/>Yes, a romantic comedy with zombies - as the tagline states - may very well end up being the best film I have seen this year, and I find that incredibly refreshing. From the opening nod to George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" to a downright absurd final shot, ""Shaun of the Dead"" blazes a clear path into horror parody via social satire. Obvious shots of Shaun staggering out of bed to go to work to his bus ride packed with equally spaced-out passengers work surprisingly well thanks to our knowledge of what is to come. In fact, the humor of the first act relies almost entirely on that knowledge as when Ed threatens his roommate Pete during an argument with ""And the next time I see you, you're dead!"". I can only wonder how those scenes would play to someone unaware of the film's title and subject matter.<br/><br/>Once the characters finally catch up with the audience, the film moves comfortably into horror territory with equal amounts of practicality and absurdity. When Shaun and his best friend Ed encounter their first zombies in the garden, they begin by tossing random objects at their heads to kill them. Everything from toasters to Shaun's prized vinyl collection. And when that doesn't work, it's off to the shed for a shovel and cricket bat. From that point on, every move Shaun makes for his own survival makes complete sense, even it rarely works out for comedic purposes.<br/><br/>In it's final act, the film does grow surprisingly dark as some characters meet less than pleasant fates, but that doesn't hinder the hilarious epilogue. A two minute epilogue that takes one last jab at our society and perceived humanity.<br/><br/>Better than ""28 Days Later"" & the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is, most importantly, an instant classic and I can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>Rating [on a 5 star system] : 4 1/2 stars"

English humor has the ability to make you laugh at it over and over again. not only is the film funny but the love story at the heart of is also brilliant. its not the sappy everything has a happy beginning AND ending story. i mean this is a regular boring guy who girlfriend wouldn't have thought about it again if it wasn't for the hoards of zombies. Oh and the timing of all the characters is superb. so there you funniest film ever."

","I saw a preview last night and thought the movie was incredibly funny and smart in it's comedic touches. The timing of the actor's delivery was great and added to the funny script.<br/><br/>Because of the title, I was a bit worried that this was going to be a movie in the genre of ""Scary Movie"". I'm not a fan of that series of movies and I was very pleasantly surprised that this was a different type of movie, and a much better one at that.<br/><br/>For those wondering how the movie will work in the US, I think the audience reaction says it all. The entire audience laughed any times, they had a great time, and gave a standing ovation to the Actors/Writers/Director in attendance for the promotional tour. As was said last night, ""Comedy is universal."""

","First, there was Spaced, a master piece of modern comedy, the very pinnacle of everything that is a sitcom. Now, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have managed to out do themselves once again with this gem of zombie movie making (Romero himself said it was the best zombie movie he'd seen since he made his own). It was like they were reading our minds, just when we stopped laughing and calmed down, perhaps had a cup of tea, after the hilarious zombie episode of spaced with vulva, Shaun Of The Dead arrives on the seen. Not only hilarious, not only classic zombie but also fantastically acted (good job Nick Frost) and beautiful to behold (see the pub seen with Ed comforting Shaun after his breakup).<br/><br/>Our only question now is; a Sequel? Whilst Pegg and Wright do indeed rule, and rule with an iron fist, could they do it justice? Perhaps time will tell. But for now I cant wait to look out for them made up as zombies in Romero's new movie Land of the Dead, where they deservedly will be immortalised by the man that spawned a legacy of amazing movies, including this one."

","It's not very of that a film lives up to it's tagline but Shaun of the Dead really is ""A romantic comedy. with zombies"". Not only that but it's the best ""romantic comedy. with zombies"" since Braindead (Peter Jacksons early brilliant gore movie). The UK doesn't do many decent films these days but we are developing a nice niche in comedy/post-modern horror movies. Dog Soldiers, 28 Days Later and now Shaun of the Dead are three of the best horror movies of recent years. the former and later especially brilliantly pay homage to while sending up their genre. Shaun of the Dead is very, very funny especially if you've seen plenty of zombie movies and British quirky sitcoms. As well as funny though it is also cleverly and, at times, quite gruesomely a horror film. In fact it is not just one of the best zombie movies of recent years but one of the best movies full stop."

","SHAUN OF THE DEAD (4+ outta 5 stars)<br/><br/>Definitely the best movie in the ""living dead"" genre since the original ""Dawn of the Dead""!  Even though the movie is a comedy, the humour comes from the characters of the people who find themselves in the midst of a zombie invasion... the zombies themselves are as creepy and as deadly as in the George A Romero originals.  Shaun, an aging English working man, afraid to grow up into a mature adult and having girlfriend trouble as a result, wakes up one day to find London being overrun with flesh-eating zombies. This might just be the chance he is looking for to make something of himself in the eyes of his girl... if he can just avoid being eaten.  This isn't a silly spoof in the style of the ""Scary Movie"" series...  it is a genuinely effective mix of laughter and suspense.  British actors are so great at portraying these ""working class"" characters and making them funny and also easy to identify with.  From the opening strains of The Specials single ""Ghost Town"" the movie seems to do everything right... and there are so many ways it could conceivably go wrong.  Much as I enjoyed the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake... this movie is clearly the Zombie Movie of the Year! (Also it's nice to see the old-style zombies again... slow, lurching and relentless.)"
"Howlin Wolf","8","0","1","29 July 2004"," Works as comedy, works as horror. Inspired!
","Praise be! A Britcom from people with TV backgrounds that has an actual STORY rather than playing like a string of sketches... ! The in-jokes and nods to fans of ""Spaced"" are there in their hundreds, but can be disregarded altogether without any apparent effect on the 'enjoyment' factor. It really is gratifying to see a film from fairly modest origins so smartly assembled in most departments.<br/><br/>It's also pleasing to see aspirations that go beyond the limited confines of its genre. I would classify this as a comedy first and foremost, but what's majorly impressive is that the horror elements are so scarcely the butt of the jokes. It must have been tempting to slide into 'parody' at times, but generally the makers take great pains to avoid that potentially 'lazy' avenue here. It's such a clever meld of genres that it represents the birth of a whole new category - the ""rom-zom-com""!<br/><br/>The 'scale' of laughter was gradually progressive, in my case; beginning with wry smiles to small chuckles and on occasion all-out guffaws. This is one of those watches where the whole thing gets more enjoyable as it goes along. The 'small details' I actually often found funnier than the obvious one-liners (witness the corner-shop scene!) I'd call it 'character-comedy' at its best because we get so attached to the principles. It becomes a sort of 'bonding ritual' to laugh at the many foibles that are purposely brought to our attention in the early set-up scenes. By the denouement you'll be rooting for Shaun and his slacker mates to triumph because the depiction of their humdrum lives shattered is probably very much like how it would be in our own cases!<br/><br/>If a slogan were to be plucked from this review for the purposes of 'advertising', (I'm open to offers - minimal charge!) I'd have no regrets about being shamelessly cheesy enough to label ""Shaun of the Dead"" as being ""The freshest comedy treat of 2004""... !<br/><br/>(8/10 or ****/***** in profile ratings system)"

"zdac","8","0","1","23 July 2004"," This is the one that REAL zombie fans have been waiting for!!
","I was practically giddy watching this film... as a zombie movie, despite being a comedy, this film really is the one I've been waiting for ever since discovering the Romero classics in high school. It truly is the smartest, most reverent, and possibly -best- zombie movie made since DAY OF THE DEAD... maybe even DAWN OF THE DEAD! ( yes, I realize that's a form of heresy )<br/><br/>The key here is that everything was just done so right! As a comedy, it works... the performances are very strong, especially in our main lead. You never really feel that the characters' only reason to exist is to set up a zombie punchline. The writing is fluid and clever, and you care about Shaun and his friends too.<br/><br/>It's also important to point out that although this is a comedy, it is NOT a parody. Although there are some hilarious, occasionally satirical moments, the film is predominantly ""straight"". It simply treats itself as a sincere British blue-collar comedy... as invaded by bonafide Romero-zombies! There is nothing completely absurd or slapstick here... the circumstances are deadly earnest. All the situations are wonderfully reminiscent of those fleeting daydreams we all have had after seeing DAWN OF THE DEAD, applying the possibilities of zombie attack to our own mundane realities. Where would you hide? Where would you find a weapon? Who would you save? Would you crack under pressure or would you be a real survivor? <br/><br/>Add to this that the zombies themselves are actually quite pathetic, obstacles more than true threats. Yes, that's right... slow zombies!!<br/><br/>I've long held that fast zombies are an aberration, going for the cheap fright, and ignoring what zombies are really all about. Fast zombies are like werewolves that shoot lasers out of their eyes... sure it's ""more dangerous, more scary"", but it misses the point. It's good to see here that the spirit of the Romero zoms is being kept, er... alive?<br/><br/>Overall, a solid film... and as a genre homage, brilliant! This one really rises out of the mire of the zombie-retreads we've seen lately. A must-see!"

","Shaun of the dead, for me anyway, is a masterpiece. I may sound a bit strange because I love most zombie films anyway, but Shaun Of The Dead really tickled my funny-bone. I think the reason for this is that Simon Pegg is a real comedy genius and shows what I'm sure any average English (or any other nationality for that matter) would do in that sort of situation. I also saw 28 Days Later and I thought this was fab and because Shaun Of The Dead had a higher budget which would turn it into another zombie film which is like every other film. The writing is perfect and the stars, although not recognisable to anyone other than British people, are spot-on and provide a black-comic film which I really enjoyed. This film is fab and should be seen whether you're into the genre or not."

"Fenris Fil","9","0","1","1 June 2004"," Hilarious tribute to zombie films.
","Much has been made about the links to the cult English series ""Spaced"", however even that aside this film is an excellent parody of the Zombie film genre. I heard that even George Romero was impressed with the way it was done. <br/><br/>By co-incidence I've spent a lot of time this year watching classic Zombie films so they were all fresh in my mind when I watched this and it is brilliantly done. There are many clever little tributes to various films (and yes also self referential moments to the series ""Spaced"" as well). Night and Dawn of the dead are referenced several times and other films such as 28 days later, Evil Dead and even the Clockwork Orange (not a Zombie film but still a classic) gets a tribute. But even that all aside I think most people will find this film thoroughly enjoyable. There are a lot of great one liners and amusing dialogue as the situation itself is hilarious. In a way it turns out to be one of the most realistic Zombie films to date due to the bumbling ineffective way the protagonist and friends deal with the situation at hand. <br/><br/>The horror side of the film isn't skipper over either, there is a classic zombie film scene at the later end of the film where one of the gang meets his gory demise, and at various times Shaun himself has to deal deal with those close to him returning from the dead. The zombies themselves look very good and the approach of getting fans of ""Spaced"" to come in as the zombie extra's has a resulted in a worryingly realistic zombie mob.<br/><br/>Being a tribute to the classics the film features the more familiar slow, slightly silly zombies that are a menace only when they catch you by surprise or when in mass numbers (which is most of the time) rather then the fast on their feet mega aggressive zombies that are more popular these days through films such as the new (I hesitate to call it a remake) Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. These zombies often seem quite silly when in smaller numbers and without the element of surprise and this film takes maximum advantage of that.<br/><br/>Really I don't think this film could have been any better then it was. Despite revelling in parody and classic zombie style the film doesn't become predictable and keeps a good pace throughout. The same can't really be said for other recent zombie films I have seen. In summary, for fans of Zombie flicks it's a classic, for Spaced fans it's a magnificent and I think for everyone else it'll still be an enjoyable one to remember.<br/><br/>This is a film definitely going into my DVD collection."

","Dog Soldiers.<br/><br/>28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Haute Tension.<br/><br/>Undead.<br/><br/>Over the past year or so, it seems that just about all of the great horror films have come from everywhere but the USA. With the release of Shaun of the Dead, that streak seems to want to keep on keepin' on.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, I do believe that I now have a brand spankin' new ""favorite zombie film ever"". We've talked about this in a few threads so far this year, have it be about the trailer or whatever, and I just now got the chance to watch this instant classic tonight. When I woke up today I didn't have any intention on view it today, but thank God that all of that changed. <br/><br/>The film starts out somewhat slow, a rather odd pacing for a film of this sort. We are introduced to all of the characters right off the bat, in a way that feels more like a drama or a romantic comedy than any sort of horror film. Then again, as the tagline says, it is basically a romantic comedy...with zombies. Starting out, I was questioning the way it began, but once it was all said and done it made the start of the film just feel perfect to me. You had enough of all of the characters by the time the real action started, that all of the characters actually meant something to you.<br/><br/>I appreciate that, especially in a film of this sort. Many filmmakers never take the time to allow the viewer to have any sort of understanding of any of the characters in a film like this, with the exception of one or two main stars.<br/><br/>So yeah, a romantic comedy...with zombies is basically what we have here, and by God it's absolutely perfect. Even at the start, when the plot seems to be going at a slower pace, there are things in the background letting you know what is to come, various little things where you see the zombie epidemic starting up, and it's just a riot. Shaun doesn't seem to expect anything, and why should he? Afterall, who in their right mind would actually take small details and come to the conclusion that zombies must be a comin'?<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time a ""horror"" film had such a perfect mixture of, well, everything. Laughs (a lot of laughs), sentimental moments, straight up action, gore gore and more gore, a great script, a fantastic and simple plot, and every other thing you could ask for. It's all here, and it all comes together unlike any film in recent memory. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, the zombies in this film...they aren't kung-fu stars, they don't run up and down the streets, and they aren't superhuman. What we're dealing with here are old school, hard-core, wanting nothing but YOUR flesh zombies who can hardly stand up or walk.<br/><br/>Just the way I like em.<br/><br/>Without even needing to think about it for even a second, without second thoughts, this gets an instant 10/10 rating from me. Dawn of the Dead? House of 1000 Corpses? House of the Dead? I don't think so, nothing like that can even touch this film, it's not even a contest. Hey, I loved Dawn of the Dead just as much as the next guy, it was great also, but Shaun just blows it out of the water in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's weird, in Shaun I literally do not have a single complaint. There wasn't even a character that I hated, like there almost always is in a film like this. I either flat out loved every character in the film, or I loved to hate them. If this one is released in theaters here in the USA, you can be sure that I'll be the first one standing in line. I already want to see it on the big screen, and I really want the DVD right now.<br/><br/>Yeah, I say it's my favorite ""zombie"" film, but it's much more than that also. I mean, I have the same sort of feeling now that I've seen this film that I had after seeing flicks like Big Fish and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind earlier this year. That feeling being of 100% satisfaction.<br/><br/>Download it, then watch it in the theater when it comes out here in the USA, and then buy the DVD.<br/><br/>And pray to God for a sequel of some sort, or at least another feature film from the duo of Simon Pegg (main star) and Edgar Wright (director). They also co-wrote the script with one another, this being their first major feature film. So that's all for now, I'm sure I'll make more comments on this as the thread goes forward. I just wanted to get a few things off my chest before bed. Hopefully this will get a few of you interested in it, just as I helped some people get interested in Haute Tension, Undead, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>We can't allow films like these to go unnoticed."

Imagine a marriage of the best elements of British TV comedies with Romero's ""dead"" series and you have ""shaun of the dead."" <br/><br/>The characters are all highly memorable, and there are so many quick one liners that the film just begs a second viewing.<br/><br/>The film also has the honor of featuring a certain someone from a highly popular ""business"" comedy series in the UK. <br/><br/>It's so refreshing to see a film maker create a unique vision to this whole sorry comedy/horror genre. The Scary Movie series may be somewhat entertaining, but truly are brain dead comedies. <br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead, however, is smart, gory, and a blast from beginning to end. This film will have a cult following, that is guaranteed.<br/><br/>SEE IT!"

","Simon Pegg is a funny guy, why is he funny? Maybe because he's just 'so terribly' English, maybe it's just born talent, either way ""Shaun of the Dead"" is worthy of many people's viewing... <br/><br/>Originally I wasn't keen on watching this film at the cinema as I am no major fan (don't watch them!) of Pegg's television efforts like 'Spaced' but friends dragged me and although in places my thoughts were correct (because SotD is very much like a television movie) I was really glad I watched it... Many laughs and a good spoof on the Zombie movie genre. The support cast are all in all pretty good and I was happy to see brief cameo's by Martin Freeman of ""The Office"" and Matt Lucas of ""Little Britain"" 7/10"

","i had been looking forward to see this, though i had mixed feelings about it. when i saw the trailer i didn't really know what to think, but now i've seen the movie i do: it's brilliant! pure entertainment, a good laugh with much respect to the horror genre! a cute and well brought fun storyline and a very well paced zombie slasher in one. that's an amazing achievement! i hadn't seen any of the actors before, except Bill Nighy. but they all play their characters really well. the soundtrack and often fast paced montage sure adds up to the enjoyment of this film. last week i saw Dawn of the Dead (the new version) which i really enjoyed for the new styletreat and changes in the storyline. this film (shaun...) however feels much better on the comedy side and still brings a great homage to the zombie genre. if you haven't already; go and see it yourselves, it's well worth the time and money!"

","""Flesh....Brains....Trousers!"" Well, maybe not the last one but Zombies always seem to be after the same thing: Food. I mean, don't they ever want employment? Money? Well...no. They don't actually. Because Zombies have been shuffling in to our cinemas for over fourty years (so, they should be paid, damnit!), starting off with George A. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' which, sorry George, I didn't like. For me, it was too slow (I know Zombies don't run!) and it got boring. But Shaun Of The Dead...it's a different story altogether! It's fast, funny as hell and can actually get you moved (one part in perticular which I will not mention. You'll have to find out for yourself!). 29 year-old Shaun works 9-5 in an electric appliance shop. One day, after deciding that the most romantic place to take your girlfriend out to is the Winchester, she decides to dump him. However the day after, all is not what it seems as the undead stumble about, fall in to his garden and gets photographed by one of his best mates called Ed. Who else can use records to try and get rid of the undead? Maybe he should have tryed a bit of Des O'Conner. That would have shifted 'em! Simon Pegg is great in his first major starring role as the anti-hero Shaun. But it's his best mate Ed (played brillliantly by Nick Frost) that steals the show. His quips and suggestions just come out of the blue! I won't give too much away. Just that shuffle along to the cinema, get a big bucket o' popcorn and get ready for the funniest hour and fourty minutes of your (undead)life! This is an excellent alternative to the other zombie movies out there but I will say this: is ISN'T as gory as the other movies!"
"mc007a0331","9","0","1","10 May 2004"," Perfectly funny and perfect in other ways too.
","The hero, Shaun, shares a house in a tacky London suburb with his best mate, who is a slob and another 30 year old man who is normal.  They are immersed in the local pub culture and this together with his unreliability causes Shaun's attractive girl friend to dump him.  At this point a virus descends on the country turning huge numbers of people into aggressive zombies. Shaun rises to the occasion and all ends more or less happily.  This is a wonderfully funny film, the best comedy I have seen for many, many years. The dialogue crackles, though a non-British audience may miss some of the jokes and nuances.  However film enthusiasts will not miss the amusing references to other films; notably to ""Man Bites Dog"" when the two teams meets and to ""The 39 Steps"" [Hitchcock] ending."

","Boys, this movie rocks! It is a peculiar, really British sort of a gory comedy, a fun zombie movie, that it is full of blood and drama inside.<br/><br/>It is the story of a clerk that become a hero and at last find the courage to front his girlfriend and win her love, losing his mom and his best friends in doing so. It is also a very good approach to the usual zombie film , the classical one this time (no running berserkers here, but the old, slow, brainless, cannibal beasts that George Romero used to become the legend he is. After 28 days later, here is another little gem from the Isles (and the final scene, with the Queen music on background, is a great idea - after all, most of us are already zombies in our normal life)"

","Advertised as the best (and only) rom-zom-com you'll ever see, this film was intended as a spoof on dawn of the dead (the old one - the fact it came out about the same time as the remake just a coincidence) but it does so much more than that.  Great to see a Brit-film that actually lives up to expectations, I can't remember the last time a film made me laugh so many times. I have to say i didn't expect Simon Pegg's style of comedy to translate to the big screen very well (he and many of the other actors are much better known for tv work) but this film was fantastic. If you enjoy laughing til you cry, this film is for you. Although I think SOTD is only on general release in the uk, I advise anyone; download it, mail order it, do whatever it takes to watch this movie. 10/10"
"cheese_meister","Null","0","1","29 April 2004"," One of the best Brit Flicks in ages
","At first when I heard the title, I thought it was going to be a lame parody of the George A. Romero film, in the style of the 'Scary Movie' trilogy. However, upon finding out it was written Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I decided to give it a go, being a fan of 'Spaced'.<br/><br/>Having now watched it twice and intending to go back for a third helping, you can tell I enjoyed it. Maybe the humour isn't for everyone - like 'Spaced', you either get it, or you don't - but it is certainly worth going to see. Okay, so you don't expect to see lavish sets and million-dollar effects shots, but that's not what this film is about. It's trying to make us laugh while making us think about how our society has become zombified in the process of our mundane, repetitive lives, very much like the original 'Dawn of the Dead' did.<br/><br/>Look around you next time, see how like the shambling zombies a lot of people have become, aimlessly wandering from place to place, blank expressions on their faces.<br/><br/>Fantastic use of limited sets, script got a bit loose in places, but the little jokes in the film for Spaced fans as well as the great one-liners just make the film for me.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10. Have a banana!"

","this has to be the most unique zombie film ever it combines elements of your typical date movie and elements of your typical zombie film with fluid storytelling excellent way to portray the ignorance and lack of courage of people in technologically-advanced modern societies; it is displayed as both ironic and horrific the lack of social,political, and emotional awarness by the characters is at times fun to watch and at others most disturbing, a great contrast the actors are excellent the gore is gruesome, yet not focused upon heavily(a good thing) the speed of the film makes for a very realistic portrayl of an apocalytic event, which causes the audience to find theirselves laughing over the jokes and missing others, a great way to get us to watch it again, but the theme is very serious and very relevant to our times, despite the humorous situations"
"gdbgriffin","10","0","1","28 April 2004"," The best English movie of the last 10 years
","I confess I am a massive fan of Spaced so came at this with some high expectations that were not disappointed.<br/><br/>I have to agree that this film is quintessentially English, like the Long Good Friday, The Ladykillers etc. and is none the worse for it.<br/><br/>
Unlike most other recent Brit comedies, it makes no attempt to internationalise its content, it also has a number of people with dead end jobs. Unlike all of the Richard Curtis films, which I love by the way, which tend to be populated with the landed classes, wealthy middle class professionals or eccentrics, this film has working class characters in suburbia.<br/><br/>It is a perfect parody of Zombie films and also the occasional numbness of English existence.  I particularly enjoyed the inability of any of the characters to shoot straight in direct contrast to most Hollywood horrors where ""one shot stops"" seem to be the order of the day.<br/><br/>I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but it has one of the funniest scenes even screened, involving zombies and a record collection.<br/><br/>It is a miracle that it got funding and was filmed.  This is exactly what the British film industry needs more of.<br/><br/>PS Keep an eye out for those cameos!"

","This was a brilliant film I must say. I thought it would be a bit better, couple of more jokes and stuff, but it was very good. It was a horror, a comedy, a suspense and most importantly a british film. The right actors were definately chosen although they could have replaced Ed with Bill Bailey to complete the whole Black Books circle, but Nick Frost was still BRILLIANT!<br/><br/>The directing was was bloody good as well. The fast shots of someone doing something like going to the toilet were just great. Very well done by the director I think. Also very well acted. I also admire the time they took to make this. They had to make the film in a short time from when they found out a remake of Dawn of the Dead was in production and to the opening of it. I was very impressed with the effects, directing, acting, story, and most of all the conclusion that the dead were awaken by radioactive monkeys. I tip my hat to you.<br/><br/>4 stars * * * *"

I get too involved, too upset and too freaked out by gore so horror is the only film genre that I avoid like the plague.<br/><br/>THIS film - however - looked special enough for me to brave the trauma and I'm so glad I did.  Even if I was curled up in a ball with my hands over my face for a fair proportion of the film.  Sorry, by the way, to all those in the cinema who got a few extra frights from the wee stifled squealing noises I made every now and again.<br/><br/>Many of the comments already listed focus on the film's solid 'Britishness' and consider it unlikely to do well on the other side of the Atlantic. Whilst I wholeheartedly agree that the movie is firmly - completely - wonderfully British (no casting of US actors to sweeten the state-side box office potential here!) I think there's just a possibility it could achieve a respectable level of interest and cult status with a discerning US crowd. There are a few North Americans who realise that British Comedy isn't all Benny Hill, Are You Being Served or Hugh Grant who will seek out the strange and unusual.<br/><br/>Just so long as Pegg et al are not seduced into trying to work in Hollywood - that would be a very bad idea.<br/><br/>Hats off to all involved in this hugely enjoyable movie.

","The thing is, ""Spaced"" (the TV series from which this is closely derived) was perfect. Did I say that? Blimey, a perfect series. Wow. So this is not perfect because it occasionally looses it's way trying to balance it's heady blend of extreme horror, genuine drama and big 'ol fashioned belly laughs. That's a hard trick to pull off and ""Shaun"" succeeds way more than it fails.<br/><br/>In the red corner, Shaun (the magnificently louche Simon Pegg) and his mate agonise over which of his precious LP collection to spin at the zombies' heads while the undead loom over them. Very threatening (not). In the green corner, a really heavy scene in the pub where Shaun has to shoot his dear old mum in the head because she's copped a bite from a nasty. The latter is much more effective than the former and I can't help but think (director) Edgar Wright is really hankering to make this a full-on drama. He has all the tools.<br/><br/>Anyway, see ""Shaun"" because it's really good, much better than 28 Days Later."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie for two reasons. Firstly I love horror movies and zombie movies are one of my favorites, Secondly I also loved spaced and the actors in this film had all been in previously very funny programs from The Office to Black Books. I think watching this film will show people exactly what British Comedy is currently about.<br/><br/>
The film is great I wasn't disappointed, there are loads of great moments and some really laugh out moments. The 1st half of the film is very tight and jokes keep coming, my only problem with the film is like most British comedies the second half becomes darker and not as fun. I still enjoyed it though and can't wait for the DVD release!<br/><br/>I give it a double Adam B thumbs up. Go see it if your in a good mood it will be great, if your in a bad mood it'll cheer you up!.<br/><br/>PS.

","I was very lucky to be present at a staff preview and I can whole heartedly say this is one of the best films I have seen this year!<br/><br/>It is just so british in its dealing with zombees, what other nationality would consider either going the pub to escape them or having a nice cup of tea?  Only we could manage to have a ""six months later"" and only have the whole occurance happening in one city, in America it always spreads and it is assumed that the world has been taken over.<br/><br/>Only we brits could manage to walk to the newsagents past numerous undead and dead alike and not spot that there is something seriously amiss.  The comic timing of the tv channel changing made this even more evident.<br/><br/>Also, the music timing is spot on, I have a whole new appreciation for Queen.  The ""White Lines"" moment is something not to be missed.<br/><br/>I am planning to go see it again as I feel this is one of those bonus films that each time you watch it you pick out extra things.<br/><br/>I look forward to any sequels that may be in the future."

","'Shaun of the Dead' starring and co-written by Simon Pegg (of 'Spaced' fame), aims for pure Brit comedy whilst still showing great respect to George Romero's classic trilogy.<br/><br/>Whilst the plot remains very simple (basic zombies take over the world type stuff), the script is injected with fantastically humorous scenes that had me crying with laughter.<br/><br/>Although the film takes a darker twist in the final third, you still laugh out loud at the one-liners and the comic performance of Pegg is absolutely spot on.

"gopau96","9","0","1","20 April 2004"," A gory surprise of a movie
","First let me say that this is probably the first ever splatter movie that I'm about to give a rave review. Some are well crafted but I find it hard to enjoy the gore that's mandatory in most of them. When I saw the trailer for Shaun of the Dead I instantly envisioned an English version of Scary Movie and decided to never see it. But it was the only movie showing in my local theatre, so I decided to give it a go (you only live twice after all).<br/><br/>To see a movie with expectations lower than a David Lynch dwarf can be really fantastic, as in this case. What unfolded in front of my eyes was actually something groundbreaking new. Take two cups of good English comedy, add some tongue-in-cheek gore, put some drama with a bit of romance into the mix and you get Shaun of the Dead. All these genres put into one movie could easily create a huge mess but this is certainly not the case here. So what makes this movie stand out comparing it to similar outings like Scream and Scary Movie? Well, it's simply much braver! Scream eventually was too similar to the movies it made fun of while all the Scary Movies go for cheap jokes that we've all heard before. Shaun of the Dead on the other hand has lots of intelligent humour that will please most audiences.<br/><br/>
Simon Pegg is totally convincing in the lead, but Nick Frost gets most of the laughs as his slacker friend Ed. Kate Ashfield and Dylan Moran also deserve praise for their roles. The only reason I don't give Shaun of the Dead a ten is because it can be hard to take the dramatic moments seriously between all funny moments. Go and see it if you want to see a zombie movie that gives you a good time instead of nightmares!<br/><br/>Verdict 9/10"

","This film is a geek boy's wet dream! It is a pleasant and refreshing surprise that a film about zombies, and also a British film is so fresh and vibrant and so entertaining. Spaced creative duo Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright are the writers here and Wright is the director. Their obviously geekish love of film is evident in the superbly entertaining Spaced and in this film as well. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg leads a superb cast of comic talent and plays the part of loser Shaun to perfection. The film is an obvious homage to Dawn Of The Dead and follows almost the same pattern. One morning the world is suddenly crawling with the undead, and to ingenious comical effect the intellectually challenged Shaun and his best mate, equal in the stupid loser stakes, Ed, don't realise this for ages. The performances of both Pegg and Nick Frost as Ed are superb. The dialogue in the film is fantastic. There are constant laughs throughout this and some real big belly laughs too. Kate Ashfield is also good as Shaun's long suffering girlfriend. There is also great suport from Lucy Davis and a superb Jessica Stevenson. I'm a little disappointed Stevenson, a lead in Spaced is relegated to a cameo here.<br/><br/>The film is superb as a comedy but what marks this down as instant cult classic is the fact that the dramatic sides and the horror elements also work great. There are some genuine jumps and scares and Wright manages to create real tension. I have to safely say as well the soundtrack is one of the best ever. This is overall a great film for buffs and general movie goers alike. This is perhaps the film of the year so far, alongside School Of Rock. ****"

","This is a more than mildly entertaining film which will make you laugh out loud. There are little problems with it but it's still a must-see film. The gore is amusingly done and the dialogue is first rate. The actors are all from our fine British comedies and come together in a superb ensemble cast. The film is essentially British and so lacks that American fast pace but makes up for it with quirky originality and odd moments. The key joke is that Britain would be very similar if everyone were zombies and the film plays on the great wartime pragmatism of the nation. The last scene is utterly brilliant and is a great relief after all the obvious plot turns towards the end play out as you might expect any zombie film to. Just as we did with 28 days later we show that Zombie films are best when British."

","As a big fan of Simon Pegg and all of his 'Spaced' cronies, I was SO looking forward to seeing this film, and went along on the day of release. It didn't disappoint. In fact, it was so good, I went again the following day! Everything - every SINGLE thing - about this film is fantastic; the script, the direction, the acting, the jokes...there is nothing wrong with this movie at all. Nick Frost as Ed is his usual brilliant, slovenly self, and it's brilliant seeing Jessica Stevenson ('Spaced's Daisy) pop up as Yvonne. She may only be in three scenes, but she's great, as are all her friends... I could throw all the superlatives in the world at this movie, none of which would do it justice. Brilliant on every level, this really is a Must-see film. If this doesn't win a stack of awards, I'll be at a loss. Excellent."

","Meet Shaun, a 29 year old senior electronics shop assistant (because he's the oldest one there) who lives in a flat with a miserable git, Pete (Peter Serafinowicz) and a lazy git, Ed (Nick Frost). His social life consists of the local pub. Shaun's girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) is bored, she hates the pub and wants some romance in the relationship, but after yet another cock-up from Shaun, she dumps him. Trouble is, the undead have just starting roaming the streets...<br/><br/>Shaun of the dead is funny. Hilarious, in fact. But, it's not actually a spoof. Zom-Rom-Com runs the tagline and that's exactly what you get. It's got zombie's, claret and various bizarre ways of eliminating them, Shaun and Ed rifling through the record collection, carefully selecting LP's to behead the undead with. It's got romance, Shaun and Liz's relationship bouncing back and forth, coming to a head as they find the pub under siege and no escape. And it's got comedy, built not from piss-take zombie bashing, but from everyday banter and satirical observations at the expense of the entire British nation. It even has moments of genuine melodrama, such as when Shaun realises he must take out his mother before she turns, in a set-up aping ""Reservoir Dogs"" classic ending. Telly addicts will have a field day spotting the plethora of stars on display (Lucy Davis - The Office, Dylan Moran - Black Books, Bill Nighy, - Auf Wiedersehen Pet) while others are of the blink and you'll miss them variety, including fellow ""Spaced"" co-star Jessica Stevenson as another survivor.<br/><br/>The yanks will probably hate this. The humour is very British, in fact the whole thing is, and lovers of the original 60's and 70's shockers will find plenty to moan at. But, let them. Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest British comedies in a very long time. Writers Edgar Wright and Shaun Pegg should be applauded for their ability to look at British life and take the piss out of it, while also maintaining a credibility many serious movies fail to adhere to.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"sackleywhistle","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," Solidly, wittily put together.
","Let me first pre-empt this review with a little background. I love zombie movies. Admittedly, its a sub-genre that is over-populated and stories are recycled time and time over, but the Romero Living Dead trilogy is brilliant (particularly Dawn of the Dead), the recent DotD remake was pretty good and 28 Days Later is one of my favourite recent movies, probably my favourite British movie ever made. Which leads me to my second point. I am not a fan of British ""comedy"" films. Four Weddings, i'll allow, is actually very good mostly. Withnail and I is classic. But the rest are fairly samey and safe, without much of the fire and wit that British TV comedy seems to do very well at the moment.<br/><br/>As a former student, I must confess a guilty love of Spaced. I'm a film nut, so anything with references to cult movies is preaching to the converted. Added to that, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson et al are not only gifted comedic performers, they are credible actors. Spaced was slightly different - the anti-Friends - and has a very specific appeal. It is with joy and hope for the future, that I can honestly say that Shaun of the Dead is worthy of sitting next to all the above on a DVD shelf.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes zip past, littered with cinematic references and techniques (the smash cuts from Requiem for a Dream, for example), ticking all the boxes of not only the horror/Zombie rampage genre but also the level of humour expected of these performers. Essentially, if you've seen any of Pegg, Davis, Moran etc in their other well known roles, they are riffing on those personas under different names. Once the situation has been established and the plan formulated, the gags slow down a bit to (ahem) flesh out the plot and fulfill the cliches inherent to the setup.<br/><br/>Its here that the film may lose some of its fans as it really becomes less of a comedy and more of a sidewise-glancing genre entry. There are genuine shocks, a sense of impending doom and strangely touching farewells, not to mention a handsome helping of gore. I actually found this to be quite refreshing. It would have been easy to continue ripping away at the staples of the genre, but not as memorable. For one thing, Pegg firmly establishes himself as a leading man worthy of notice. Sure, he has a schtick in terms of comedy, but like, say, Owen Wilson, it is appealing and funny. Also like Owen Wilson, he can handle the dramatic chops when required. He displays a nice versatility and a good range of emotion and you really pull for his character by the end. The same goes for Lucy Davis, who steps out slightly from the shadow of Dawn to create someone quite believable and quietly humourous. The camera really loves her here and she glows.<br/><br/>A wonderfully, almost unnoticeable aspect to the film that I never expected was, half an hour from the end, I had little idea of where the film would go and the more time ran out, the more I was convinced no-one would make it out in one piece. How right was I? Well, you should find out for yourself.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that the film works wonderfully structurally, technically, comedically and dramatically, all the time very aware of and respectful toward the genre it is lampooning. It may slow down a bit in the last third, but stay with it and you may find the idea of a follow-up not so dreadful. Personally, i'd like to see a non-sequel with the same kind of characters placed in a different genre and story, unrelated in any way to this one (current rumours include Children of the Shaun and From Dusk Til Shaun, haw-haw).<br/><br/>It is good news for the British film industry that this film is being so well received here and internationally as we might finally shrug off the Full Monty/Hugh Grant romcom limitations inherent to UK successes in cinema, to see films of the quality of The Office reach big screens rather than small. If you dig cult films, alternative British comedy and something more worthy of rememberance than Two Weeks Notice, go see this film while its still around. It will be everything you expect and nothing you expect. How often do you say that about a British film?"

","First things first, if you have not seen this film yet go see it. Now! It is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Right, now that's out of the way lets talk about running zombies. Yes, people must agree with me, they suck. You can not beat the classic slow moving, easy to push over and dodge zombies. Yet with all this problems they still get you and rip you in half, ""I love it"". I think that's what let the remake of Dawn of the Dead down.

Now i really know how to play Darts ;-)"
"mightyalgo","9","0","1","16 April 2004"," It's a horror with jokes, not a joke horror.
","The British film industry has been crying out for a decent movie for ages - Curtis is past it, The Office should never be on the big screen... so where on earth are our good movies going to come from?<br/><br/>Well, I would cite this movie as the beginning of the a new era of British film - the one where we're original and do action as well; most British films recently have shied away from any action at all above a kind of gangland torture cliche that seems to crop up every five minutes. There is so much about Shaun of the Dead that excels: the comedy is top notch (especially if you, like Shaun, feel you're going nowhere), the zombies are well made up (the only problem with the original Dawn of the Dead was their stupid green make up) and the acting superb.<br/><br/>Most importantly though, the actual violence is done so well, it's almost unbelievable this is a British scripted and directed movie. Obviously there's not a lot of pitched gun battles, but it's very refreshing to see a film be this daring this well! Also, I think it's great to see a film so British in nature; not cod cockney gangster rubbish or anything, just genuinely lazy british.<br/><br/>If the industry is brave enough, this (along with the slightly less excellent, though very good Dog Soldiers) represents a new wave of British horror. As for the director himself, I'd like him to remember how multiple award winning director Peter Jackson started out: a low budget horror comedy flick called ""Bad Taste"" (and then Braindead). Maybe we'll be seeing a lot more of him in the future. I hope so.<br/><br/>Finally, talking to people about this movie, I've realised that many people wanted it to be funny all the way through and didn't like the darkness of the last 45 minutes. I disagree wholeheartedly. A horror spoof, with zombies having blunt false teeth or whatever, would be on a par with total vacuous tripe like ""Dracula: Dead and loving it"". A movie like this needs its dark heart to be more than a silly Mel Brooks film! I would say that we should view this film as a horror film with added comedy, not a comedy film with zombies in.<br/><br/>In short (and I know I go on forever); this is the best British Film for ten years (American money notwithstanding). Go see it as part of your patriotic duty at least. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Remember: It's not what Shaun did, it's that he did anything at all that's important.<br/><br/>P.S. It is possible to see this film as a allegorical tale of a man having to grow up and say goodbye to the trappings of childhood (mum, best freind, etc.) to grow up and commit to the woman he loves. But why bother analysing it when it's this much fun?"

","Having been a huge huge fan of Spaced and in particular Simon Pegg, I was looking forward to this film more than any other in a long long time.<br/><br/>I was not in the least bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Spaced is known for its ironic view on modern life and fast paced cutting dialogue. If you are a fan of Spaced, you will love the in jokes - PS2 playing, calling each other Babe, Shaun and Ed's relationship etc.<br/><br/>There was not one person in the cinema not laughing out loud, at all the right times, and i'm sure I was not the only one welling up towards the end.<br/><br/>I dont' want to spoil it for anyone, so I won't give it away, but all I will say is that it is so brilliantly exciting, not in the least bit predictable in plot, and you really do not have a clue how it will end!! What I wouldn't give for more films like this!!<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy this film, you have a real problem and should see someone about it. Anyone that cannot give a reason that isn't pretentious in anyway for not loving it deserves nothing but misery.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead should win every award possible - best film, direction, sound, edititng, best supporting actor, and best actor for Simon Pegg. He has just joined the big boys."

","It is a very British film. And a clear example of the difference between ourselves and the americans. When the zombies attack, the Americans go to a shopping mall (Which to be fair, is quite sensible - plenty of supplies and remote location etc). When the zombies attack England, we go to the pub. (Which is a default setting for the British - Apocalypse ? Just time for a quick pint then...) There are many scenes that are wonderful, but to describe any of them might spoil them. See this film.

"crewkerne","9","0","1","16 April 2004"," British comedy is reanimated
","AFTER the debacle that was Sex Lives Of The Potato Men, the accolade of being heralded as the saviours of British comedy may very well have been cheapened. Nevertheless, in Shaun of the Dead, writer/actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright succeed in resurrecting the idea that originality and brilliance can still be found on our shores. Described as a rom-zom-com (romantic zombie comedy), the team behind Channel Four sitcom Spaced tell the story of the ambition-starved and freshly-dumped Shaun (Pegg). Shaun, in his misery and inebriation, at first fails to notice that the dead are coming back to life but, when he and his lazy best friend are attacked, he springs into action to save his ex, her friends, and his mum. Far from being a spoof of zombie films, this is actually a much more loving and faithful recreation of the genre than the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead. Pegg and Wright clearly worship the movies they continually reference and the humour arises from the character's realistic reactions to what is going on around them (the girly scream of `Ooh, he's got an arm off' being a prime example when our hero encounters one the first undead). From the woeful attempts to destroy the zombies with a record collection, pool cues and empty beer cans, the whole thing is an honest and hilarious appreciation of how an ordinary man would deal with the apocalypse. The transition from comedy to a much darker and horrific second half is also handled well and keep an eye out for the ceaseless number of cameos. The comedy is, perhaps, a little too narrow for a global audience but it works absolutely superbly on home soil."
"KenBowler","9","0","1","16 April 2004"," A British Comedy to be Proud of!
","This film is a welcomed relief, after having to sit through the woeful Sex Lives of the Potato Men, I can honestly say that this is what British Comedy is all about. The characterisation is spot-on, the eclectic mix of characters mixes so well. The leadership skills in Shaun manifesting themselves even though he appears to be so unmotivated and complacent really makes him seem like he is some sort of hero. Shaun's best friend, Ed, really does steal the show though, his constant stream of hilarious one liners is really what turns the film from being 'funny' to 'bloody hilarious'. I defy anyone to not cry with laughter when he requests a Cornetto!<br/><br/>This is what the British Film Industry has been crying out for. For too long have many films been hyped as British comedies that will crack the American market, only to end up flat on their back-side. Whereas Sex Lives of the Potato Men was a one trick pony, with its constant sexual references, and Love Actually was merely nauseatingly pleasant, SOTD contains so many different funny scenes and moments, played out to their full comic potential by a cast containing some of British Comedy's rising stars, this really is a British film to be proud of!"

Plus the fact that it is not laughs all the way, with sad bits such as the death of Shaun's Mum, and that it gives a look at the way Britain maybe heading, everyone going to the Pub every night, playing with mobile phones all the time...ect, Shaun of the Dead becomes even better. 8/10"

","In light of the recent release of the remake or `re imagining' of `Dawn of the Dead' its hard not to make comparisons between these two films that both owe so much to George Romero's seminal works.<br/><br/>But lets not. Just for now. And take `Shaun' as a film in its own right.<br/><br/>Is it well shot? Yes - for me being English myself the look of the film, its very realistic slightly grainy look and superb colour balance brought the reality of Zombie holocaust home to me much more than any mall in Pittsburgh or nuclear bunker in Florida ever could. These are my streets, my corner shops and my local pub. There camera is intelligently used and follows the action as well as the more intimate scenes. For those who have seen spaced, there will be some familiar filmic techniques used here. Note used, not over used.<br/><br/>Is it funny? Yes. Absolutely. Hilarious. You can't fail to be awed by the second walk to the corner shop, or the background action in the first half of the movie it's a brilliant blend of black humour, physical comedy and pathos that impresses like nothing has since, well spaced really. Its sharp and dry yet it treats the matter of survival very respectfully, the drama and tension are maintained throughout. This is NOT scary movie, this is clever mature writing from some of the best talent in England today.<br/><br/>Is it Romeroie? Okay that not really a word but how does it hold up to the original films you ask? Very well indeed, Pegg has described the film as `a love letter to George Romero' and so it is. We have our beloved shuffling Zombies back again. We have charecterful dead we have many fantastic references to the early films, I wont spoil anything by listing them here but any fan will have a great time in the pub after comparing notes on the references.<br/><br/>So that thing you talked about at first, the other dead film, how does it hold up? Well Shaun is clearly a superior film to the remake of Dawn, it does all the things that the original Dawn did that the remake failed to do, it is character driven, these people are recognisable as our mates, we are involved with their lives and we are made to care, so when the chomping jaws do come we are scared for the people in the film, its great ensemble work worth believable relationships and reactions.<br/><br/>There is more care given to developing relationships than a feeble 3 minute `time is passing' montage ala Dawn 2004, there are no `disposable' un realised characters ala dawn 2004, even the people who never speak, and are hardly seen alive at all (for those whove seen it think cowboy boots) are more authentic than Meike Phiffers whole character (as good an actor as he is).<br/><br/>Okay I didn't intend when I sat down to write this to sound like a gushing fanboy, but to any Romero fan, spaced fan or basically breathing human with a sense of humour this film is that good, plus its British. So I suppose this is my love letter to Simon Pegg et al. You made a Fan's film with humour and integrity. Good on you. Go see it. Now."

In fact, only those without a sense of humour or knowledge of pop culture would be advised to stay away.<br/><br/>The only bit that made me wince slightly due to cheesiness was towards the end (won't say what happens as it would spoil the plot), but other than that it was pitch black comedy and great one liners from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Recommended, unless you have a phobia of zombies."

"alumpage","10","0","1","12 April 2004"," Best film this year!
","First of all, the only reason I went to watch this film was because a couple of my friends recommended it heartily; that's a sign of a great film, advertisement via word of mouth. Suffice to say, it's one of the best zombie/horror films in recent memory.<br/><br/>Shaun (Simon Pegg of 'Spaced' fame in superb form) is a salesperson who lives with his two mates, one (Ed) a dole hungry/lazy slob, the other (Pete) an old student friend who has a steady job. Through the film Shaun has to come to terms with responsibility and maturity ranging from relationships with his girlfriend, accepting his stepfather as a parent and person and getting a hold of his non-existent social life; all he does is spend his entire time either with Ed in the Winchester (his local) or play PlayStation games, again with Ed. In fact his dead-end 9 to 5 job routine resembles one that of a zombie, we see when he wakes up, the camera pan up from his lumbering feet to his zombie-like yawning (or should that be groaning) that he has to do this every day. This can be seen in others throughout the film, everyone is in sync, doing more or less the same things at the same time, probably for as long as they can remember. They've programmed themselves to do the every day ritual of waking up and heading of to work to an extent that we can see the film's social commentary shining through, everyone more or less, in the real world is a zombie. That's the first half of the film; the second half is where we see the actual zombies, especially (and surprisingly for a 15 rated film) plenty of stomach churning gore; *spoiler (of sorts), especially when David is ripped to pieces*. I'll round things of by saying that this is a film which manages to add plenty of laughter, romance, social commentary, the issues of responsibility added with dealing with growing up, and by mixing it with the backdrop of a zombie film, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have created a gem of a masterpiece! Highly recommended!"

","Whilst this movie contains many of the cast of Spaced (including a nicely made-up Tyres as a pub zombie) don't expect this to be Spaced - the zombie-filled feature length episode.  Aside from a few subtle nods here and there, the film references which Spaced loved to use are intentionally absent, and the only real parody is in the title.<br/><br/>However, as a film it stands on its own two feet extremely well.  The first two thirds of the film is essentially Shaun (Simon Pegg) being dumped by his girlfriend and being totally oblivious to the massing zombie hordes around him, whilst the last third is spent fending off the wretched undead.  The comedy also pretty much lies in the former part as well: once the zombies really get attacking the laughs die out in favour of action which was somewhat disappointing.  However, this said, the action really revs up from the moment Shaun picks up his cricket bat, leading to a lot of pretty satisfying zombie despatching!<br/><br/>As it happens I'm one of the shadows outside the pub when they're sat in there wondering what to do next, which was a good laugh - from what we were told it'll be worth your while getting the DVD when it comes out!<br/><br/>Anyway, go watch and enjoy, you'll be glad you did!"

By the time there was anything even close to danger, you actually felt that you knew them, and I would have been quite happy to watch a whole movie of the characters alone.  They were painted in such a way that you sympathised with them and their dead-end lives.<br/><br/>When the zombie elements start to creep in, there are many very funny scenes of the main characters' complete obliviousness to the escalating situation. There is one particularly impressive tracking shot of Simon Pegg making his way to the corner shop and back for a drink to cure his hangover, the exact same journey he made the day before - but this time with a slightly different backdrop!  Wonderful, both cinematically and humourously...<br/><br/>Throughout this film there is a well balanced mix of sadness and scares as well as the laughs.  It's certainly no spoof, and I'm sure could work as a full-blown zombie flick with minimal changes.  The effects are good, and quite graphic at points, but in a typically zombie cartoon fashion.  The performances are good, too, especially the friendship between Pegg and Nick Frost (though I'm not quite sure how much acting would have been needed here!)<br/><br/>For fans of 'Spaced', 'The Office' and other British comedies, you could spend the whole film spotting cameos.<br/><br/>All in all, this exceeded my expectations significantly.  It's just such well made, good natured, witty, infectious fun and everyones obvious love for the material is infectious.  My only worry was for the lack of an audience.  I saw it on the opening Friday night, expecting a full house - the turnout was quite embarrassing.  Perhaps it's too close on the heels of the Dawn remake...  Maybe the marketing's only reached those who didn't need it (Spaced + horror fans).  This is a shame, as even my wife (a complete horror movie hater, and never seen Spaced) said it was her favourite film in a long time.<br/><br/>I just hope word of mouth gets this film all it deserves.

","Shaun of the Dead is the best british horror movie in a long time, and the funniest film I have seen in years. It starts off with its message clear and bold - when you spend every day of your life doing the same mundane thing, are you really living?<br/><br/>Shaun lives with his mate Ed, a complete waste of space. His job is boring. He spends every night in his local, much to the despair of his girlfriend, who wants a little bit more from life. His life is going nowhere, and he is on the verge of losing everything. Then zombies start appearing...<br/><br/>This film could have been so bad - a ""Romzomcom""? But through the spot-on acting and brilliant, sharp direction by Edgar Wright, it has a vivacity that never lets up. I have never watched a film before with so many laugh-out-loud moments. The cast, made of the cream of modern british comedy, really breathe life into their characters. Simon Pegg as Shaun, shows our hero as just like the rest of us, but is excellent in a role that goes through a roller-coaster of emotions. Special mention must be given for Bill Nighy's short but poignant role which provides a turning point for our intrepid survivors.<br/><br/> I was worried if the film would stretch to feature length given the TV pedigree of the cast and crew, but the time flew by, and I was especially pleased with an ending which was true to the spirit and humour of the rest of the film.<br/><br/> Go see this film. It is worth it. I'd like to say my wife enjoyed it as well - it is the first film where she has laughed while hiding her eyes in my armpit!"

Nick Frost, as the drop-out flatmate was superb, demonstrating once again that he has a bit more range than you might expect. Simon Pegg was also excellent, although it would be easier for us to stop thinking of him AS Tim Bisley if he stopped looking exactly LIKE Tim Bisley. Out of all the other solid performances, Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran also shone. However, I too am concerned that the almost overnight success of this film may scupper the promised series 3 of Spaced."

","WARNING: This review will probably contain spoilers, I haven't decided yet.<br/><br/>Okay, let me first start off by clearing up a common misconception.  Shaun of the Dead is NOT a direct spoof of Dawn of the Dead, instead it is a spoof of zombie movies in general.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's probably the funniest movie so far this year, and one of the goriest.<br/><br/>In case you haven't read any of the fifty-or-so other comments about the film on this site, here's the plot:<br/><br/>Shaun is living in a run-down flat with an ex-college pal and his slobbish best friend.  He has a mundane job and a generally boring life.  His idea of a romantic night out involves going down the local pub, The Winchester, with his girlfriend Liz and mates.  Naturally, Liz disagrees with this and dumps him.  Shaun resolves to get her back and prove how much he loves her, but there is a slight complication in that the entire city of London seems to have suddenly been overrun by the walking dead.<br/><br/>Although it sounds more than a little mushy there is no doubt that this is a horror film.  Violent, gory and briefly genuinely scary! But first and foremost it is a comedy.  Genre fans will have a field day spotting all the references to classic zombie films (Shaun's mum is called Barbera, and they phone her to tell her they're coming to get her ;-)).<br/><br/>Overall I'd say that Shaun is definitely the funnest film I have seen for quite a while, and that can't be a bad thing."
"silentbazz","10","0","1","11 April 2004"," A fantastic flick
","I must admit I was nervous about seeing this film.  I am a massive fan of Spaced and thought the writing and direction of those shows were brilliant.. However quite a lot of writers and directors have proven that the transition from the small to the big screen just doesn't work.. and I so wanted this film not to disappoint. And, boy, it did not let me down at all. This is one genuinely funny and very creepy movie.  When people likened it to the ""An American Werewolf in London"", it was justified, the laughs come quick, thick and fast - and so does the gore!  Simon Pegg  is brilliant as Sean, portraying a man who is, for all intents and purposes, a zombie as the film opens. Shaun's drifting through life, stuck in a dead end job, coasting through life, with his loser friend Ed (Nick Frost putting in a brilliant performance) by his side and stuck in the same routine (which is putting his relationship in jeopardy).  Shaun's drifting through life so much he doesn't even notice the first signs of the Zombie epidemic occurring about him, and only when he is confronted with this situation does he finally take hold of his life, and spring into action to save his friends, his girl and, of course, his mum! This is a brilliantly observered comedy, the characters and their relationships with each other feel so genuine and because of this you really end up caring what happens to everyone in this film (something that so rarely happens in any film, let alone a horror movie).  And the film, which zips along at quite a pace, has some very genuinely funny, scary and emotional scenes in it. Before you worry about the emotional scenes slowing the movie down it should be pointed out that excellent editing means that just as it might be all getting a bit too serious, a gag or a scare jumps out of nowhere and you're off again.  It gets to the point where you're not sure what's going to happen next (emotionally speaking) and quite literally at this point.. all bets are off! The script is taut, sharp, intelligent and very, very funny.  There is more going on on-screen that you'll never catch every joke or every reference in a single viewing.  The acting is excellent and the zombies are genuinely creepy. All in all this is a fantastic flick, and I urge everyone to give it a viewing."

","After seeing Dawn of the Dead, and being a bit depressed with it (and disappointed)I had a feeling this would be the perfect antidote.  I was right.<br/><br/>From the very first, this movie was hilarious.  In the character of Shaun was something everyone in the cinema identified with.  He was a brilliant hero, rising to the challenge when he finally realized that zombies had in fact taken over (which took a while).<br/><br/>But this was more than a comedy - it was a sharply observed statement on how we live or to be precise don't live our lives today.  It was a warning, in a way, to value what we have or have the potential to achieve before it's too late.  Or maybe I'm reading into it more than was intended and it was just absolutely brilliant comedy."

","The BBC has shown the original Night and Dawn of The Dead over the weeks since Dawn's remake was released at the end of March 04, so any fans can compare all four films if they've seen them (and in my case, read the 1978 Dawn of The Dead novel). <br/><br/>In that context, coming at the end of three ""serious"" Zombie flicks in a fortnight, ""Shaun"" is just what I needed but the producers obviously aimed for a release date around that of Dawn's remake. The characters are developed far enough for you to miss them if they bite the dust and even if they conflict with Shaun & co, which didn't happen with Romero's series as he preferred the ""people not knowing each other thrown together"" angle with ""Night"" and ""Day"" of the Dead (In ""Night"" nobody would have had a publicly acknowledged black friend in late 60s Deep Southern US), and in original ""Dawn"" it's two pairs of characters who know each other through work.<br/><br/>I don't do spoilers but I will say that the running theme from Romero's flicks of what happens when the people close to you become victims, is also explored in this film with much more immediate honesty and doesn't let the viewer laugh off a pessimistic moment. In fact once they reach somewhere they think they're safe, the laughs are put on hold for the proper horror to really get a grip. It's an excellent mix of horror and comedy and certainly the most unique way I've seen of making romcom fodder interesting to a male audience (as in 99% of the usual mush, they always end up together with a lot less work). Zombie fans need to listen out for the music at the start and on the credits, but also the dialogue and check out the name of Shaun's workplace.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it but will probably buy the DVD rather than watch it again on the big screen. We'll have to see if going for the laughs allows it to beat 28 Days' $45million gross in America. Horror fans have had to put up with much worse enforced attempts at comedy with gore (witness the Freddy series). It's not laugh out loud funny all the way through but that wasn't the intention. It's well worth watching in my opinion.<br/><br/>The only criticism I couldn't refute was the ripping-off of Sam Raimi's chained-together camera zoom effects. However people not into films won't care about that. See it."

","In fact, it's the most british film i've seen in long, long time. More british than any of Richard Curtis' offerings, more british than even Harry Potter. The sense of place is strong in Shaun of the Dead. Possibly that could be an alienating feature, but in truth i loved it. Well done to all concerned.<br/><br/>It's also very funny, in a way that relies a lot on delivery and context. It's not quoteable, in that respect; the humour's difficult to relate to people who weren't there, but it's very funny on the screen. You'll just have to trust those of us who have seen it.<br/><br/>Despite that, it gets quite dark towards the end, and there are one or two lump-in-the-throat moments to go alongside the many edge-of-the-seat moments.

","Anyone who saw the popular but still underrated Channel 4 sitcom Spaced will know that it was something special. A few years on and the team from Spaced have produced their movie and it's not a dissappointment by any means.<br/><br/>
It isn't ""Spaced: the movie"" as some people might think, none of the characters from Spaced make an appearance. There are a few references to the series but they are littered through the movie in a subtle way.<br/><br/>
Simon Pegg easily takes on the role of Shaun, a 29 year old who works at an electronics store in London. His girlfriend is constantly nagging him about hanging around with his best mate Ed (Nick Frost) who is essentially living a student lifestyle without being a student. Shaun's relationship problems are the least of his worries when the living dead begin an attack on his home. What follows is a great mix of comedy, horror and some really good acting.<br/><br/>This is a film that was made with passion, the zombies are shambling, idiotic and slow just like the classic zombies from George Romero's Dead Trilogy. Where the film truly excels is that it captures a portion of the British lifestyle. Shaun asks Ed what he wants from the shop after a night of heavy drinking, his response: A cornetto. This and the pub set up will have people in the audience saying ""Hey! That's my life!"".<br/><br/>Shaun of The Dead is a movie that everyone should see, if you've ever watched Spaced and enjoyed it or if you are a fan of the zombie genre then get your ass to the cinema now. This is the best British movie in years and it would be a crime to miss out on it."

","After watching 'Shaun of the Dead', I instantly decided that it has to be my favorite British Romantic Comedy Zombie movie ever. True, there are not many other movies that fit into that particular sub-genre, but I enjoyed the film immensely all the same. I disagree that this movie is just an extension of 'Spaced', although I am a big fan of the show. What became apparent to me whilst watching 'Shaun. . .' is that writer and Actor Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright not only understand the timing of comedy, but they understand cinema. They have made an exceptionally funny film, which is not so much a parody of the Zombie movie, but a loving homage to the Zombie movie, particularly the films of George A. Romero.<br/><br/>'Shaun. . .' contains all the conventions of the Zombie movie, along with some side-splitting, very British humour. So, die-hard defenders of the Zombie movie need not be offended, 'Shaun of the Dead' has high production values for a British film, great action sequences, and dark humour which is not a million miles away from the likes of Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Lets hope the guys from Spaced will be back on the big screen soon. 8/10"

","I've loved Simon Pegg for years, ever since his early work with Steve Coogan, and am very glad he's finally starring in his own film! 'Shaun of the Dead' was exactly as I hoped it would be; funny, gory, intelligent but stupid (if that makes any sense to anyone) and farcical without becoming overly silly!<br/><br/>The acting talent was great, my favourites being Lucy Davies, Dylan Moran and of course Pegg himself, and it was great to see Jessica Stevenson popping up! I genuinely jumped a couple of times and (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!) when Dylan Moran was literally taken to pieces I cringed big time!<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is a great film with everything going for it. It's hard for me to pinpoint anything that's really wrong with it to be honest, although a couple of my friends thought some parts were just TOO serious for the surrounding material. I disagreed, I thought they handled the comedy with the tragedy, and the premise of the story is initially a tragic one, very well indeed, Pegg proving to be, like many comics, a decent comic actor. After the purile trash that was 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' (hopefully will be wiped from all our memories, there's 5 quid and 90 minutes I'll never see again) 'Shaun of the Dead' has restored my faith in British cinema, and as a mark of patriotism and respect for the film, I'm rating it 10!"

","This film is bloody brilliant!!! A great British film and a perfect homage to Romero's work as well.<br/><br/>The 'Spaced' gang got everything dead-on right (excuse the pun). Let's start with the zombie film checklist shall we -<br/><br/>1) Is it gory? Oh yes! Fantastically so. The effects and make-up work is doubly phenomenal.<br/><br/>2) Is it scary? Yes it is. It's definitely comedy-horror in both meanings of the term. The tension builds more towards the end of the film. By this point you've invested in the main characters enough that there's a heavy amount of dread that we may lose any of them. And there are a number of well-earned 'jumps' along the way.<br/><br/>3) Does it have social commentary? Yep. The original 'Dawn' is still tops at this I feel, but 'Shaun' gets some nice satirical swipes in. These aimed at the 'zombification' of our society as a whole, and if the dead did start walking around a city like London you might not notice it immediately.<br/><br/>I think those are the key elements that a good zombie flick needs. And this film passes all of them with style. But then of course it also has the added bonus of being a total scream (in the ha-ha sense). It's really insanely funny. I haven't laughed at the piccies as much in a long long time. And it's not like you just remember a few main funny bits, which happens with some comedies. 'Shaun' is continuously funny all the way through. Be it with some ace visual gag, or the more smarter stuff. I'm sure I missed some of it's subtle material but I'll try to spot it when I go see it again next week.<br/><br/>I'm also going to try to spot more joke references to zombie films of the past, and other non-zombie ones, that are scattered throughout. Horror film aficionados are going to love playing this game. There are references all over the shop. Some of them are shops in fact.<br/><br/>The cast is cool bananas. Take various actors out of all the best recent Brit comedy shows, add in Bill Nighy, and this is what you end up with. It's unbeatable imho. Simon Pegg takes the lead exceptionally well, and yet still has the film stolen from him by Nick Frost as Shaun's best friend Ed. The character of Ed is such a loser, but the way Nick Frost plays him you just HAVE to love the bloke. Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis all do great jobs too.<br/><br/>What else can I write about? The direction? Fantastic! The music? Fantastic! The ending? Oh lordy the ending is solid gold!<br/><br/>An absolute must-see."

","*** SPOILERS ARE INEVITABLE ***<br/><br/>Where to begin... The start seems like a good place. The first shock of the night was after watching the trailers, when the film certificate appeared. ""Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"". What the?! It turned out the cinema had mixed the reels up, but that was one major shock!<br/><br/>After moving down two screens, and having to endure the Orange mobile advert twice (British cinema-goers will know what I'm talking about, it's the one with Alan Cumming in it), the correct film finally started. Hoorah for the right film being shown! Anyway, the start, mostly prior to the film's narrative beginning, is a great satire of modern life - zombies, or just stuck in a routine?<br/><br/>While the film isn't made around the shocks - other than the bathroom scene, I cannot remember even jumping slightly at any other point - it stays true to the zombie genre. The zombies are stupid and lurching, and don't run (unlike in the remake of the film's semi-namesake, ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004)). The SFX and make-up teams really did a good job with the zombies and gore, with it being some of the most realistic I've seen in a film that isn't strictly a horror.<br/><br/>While I didn't get any of the ""Spaced"" (1999 TV-series) in-jokes - I watched that but don't remember much of it, and nothing in particular - they almost all flow perfectly with the script; for the ones that don't, I just assume that I don't find them funny due to general ignorance. There is also a beautiful scene in the pub when the jukebox just starts playing Queen's ""Can't Stop Me Now"" (""it's on random"" is the excuse), and the subsequent fight is perfectly choreographed, complete with flashing lights! (Its really not as bad as I make it sound here.)<br/><br/>While some ""deep meaningful"" moments occur later in the film, it is made up for in the final section, after the rather convenient appearance from the Army. I'd tell you about it, but that would ruin it even if you do like spoilers! Suffice to say that it is OMGlOLROFLl01LMAO!!!1!!!1! (or ""hilarious"", for the internet users with brains). American audiences will have to swap the name ""Trisha"" for ""Jerry Springer"", but otherwise, all is good. I say go say this film, if you have a brain that any zombie would die for!<br/><br/>PS Hoorah for British film-making! Finally, I recognise the TV channels and news anchors that are starring!"

","As with nearly all British movies this effort falls well short of Hollywood standards. A first-time script shows itself up to being rather an amatuerish attempt. Brit movies are mostly created by people who have come fresh from TV without bothering to understand the medium. Lame, quirky sit-com style dialogue dominates the first act. There's a confusion as to what the writers are trying to achieve with some vague notions about character set-up and development.<br/><br/>However, I was prepared to forgive the weak opening, after the 2nd act started well with two very funny moments. Everything seemed to be coming right and I was sitting back ready for a good hour's laughter. Unfortunately, me and the rest of the audience were to be dissapointed. The comedy dried up pretty soon, with us realising we were at a one-gag event where the writers had no idea where to go with this story.<br/><br/>The script fell into a muddle - is this sitcom? Farce? Romantic comedy? Horror? Drama?<br/><br/>Barely a snigger was to be had from the entire second half of the movie.<br/><br/>At one point, our heros are beating a zombie to 'death' in time to a Queen track being played on the duke box. Maybe this got huge laughs in other showings, but in my theatre there was a deathly silence as this scene went on and on... and on.<br/><br/>A moment later I noticed people leaving.<br/><br/>The end is pretty bad. The writers just seem to have forgotten this is meant to be a comedy. Perhaps Simon Pegg decided to write himself some emotional scenes to look good on his showreel. Waste of time - he really ain't that good an actor.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a failure. The fact it was located in Crouch End (where I grew up but is now inhabited by the media 'elite') didn't endear it to me either. They tried to make out Crouch End is full of 'normal' people (the place is full of people who think they're great movie makers but are really just average TV makers). Now, if those Crouch End zombies had been the BBC/Channel 4 TV producers, media lawyers, wanna be script writers, graphic designers, pseudo-intellectuals... now there's a zombie flick I wanna see."

","Great to see Pegg gets to do a Zombie film, I remember reading a while back that 'Dawn of the Dead' was one of his favourites.<br/><br/>It has enough to please British audiences and fans of 'Spaced' will enjoy seeing a rehash of the Tim and Mike friendship. The film's essential cynical premise seems to be that living in Britain is like living amongst Zombies anyway. It starts very promisingly and has some great key scenes like fighting off a pair of Zombies using a record collection, critically sorting and choosing which records. <br/><br/>Once all the characters get together though, the film starts to sag. The humour thins out and the plot seems to give up going anywhere. Good intelligent dialogue that 'Spaced' fans might be expecting is replaced by characters yelling and swearing. The film's budget is understandably tight but I would have hoped that Wright and Pegg could have had more fun with the genre.

","WARNING : The following review may be extremely biased based on my predisposition towards anything related in any way to the-bestest-thing-on-telly-ever, aka 'Spaced'. Please bear this in mind before rushing out to see it. If your over 40, don't like blood and guts, and aren't British, then your probably not going to like it.<br/><br/>'Shaun of the Dead' is released on Friday. Described as a 'romcom', or 'a romantic comedy with zombies', SOTD focuses on the life of Shaun (Simon Pegg), an almost-30-something who fears responsibility and growing up. So much so that his girlfriend of 3 years has had enough and dumps him, leaving him to his life sharing a flat with his best mate Ed (Nick Frost), a 30-something with the mental age of a 10 year old. To make matters worse he doesn't get on with his family and he's been stuck in the same dead-end job since he was a student.<br/><br/>Drowning his sorrows with yet another night in the pub across the road from their house, Shaun decided to sort his life out. He's going to be a good son to his mother, going to win his girl back, and going to sort his life out. One small problem though, the living dead has decided to start walking the earth. Shaun enlists the help of Ed and together they battle across London to rescue his mother and girl, and pick up the crop of the current British sitcom elite on the way.<br/><br/>SOTD is basically an extension of the 'Spaced' universe. This means we get repeated jokes (Ed and Shaun's straight-as-a-peg Heterosexual man love, just like Tim and Mikes), in-jokes (Jessica Stevenson, aka Spaced's Daisy, popping up saying ""I'm glad one of us made it), and the obvious running themes. Not wanting to face up to responsibility, trying to cling on to your youth. Make what you will of the fact that the zombies may be representative of that responsibility... take on that responsibility and you become another drone, wheeling that trolley through Asda on a Sunday afternoon wondering what happened to your life.<br/><br/>It's also very British. The Yanks just might not ""get it"". There's lots of references to British media (news, T4, music) and British institutions (the pub, pork scratchings, popping down the corner shop for a pint of milk). Then there's all the little 'Spaced' bits - references to clubbing, drugs, and dance music. One of my favourite lines is ""It's not Hip-Hop, it's ELECTRO!"".<br/><br/>Lastly a word on the certification. The actual film cert is a 15. How it managed this I have absolutely no idea because it's even more violent than the latest 'Dawn of the Dead' remake which received an 18. It perhaps managed to scrape past because it's a comedy, the violence however is not comedic. It's extremely gory and, respect to the sfx guys, extremely believable.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the violence if you love 'Spaced' and/or you love zombie films and/or you love romantic comedies go see it. Support these guys, because I'm sure if you will they'll pay us back with more gems like Shaun."

","Saw the film last night at a special preview in London and it was completely fantastic.  Very funny but also creepy in all the right places.  The zombies themselves are extremely realistic (did I say 'realistic'?) but this was probably due in part to Edgar Wright providing all the extras with a DVD of zombie clips to gen up on prior to filming (as explained at a post-screening q and a).<br/><br/>There are many, many laugh out loud moments (the first zombie kill scene in the garden will go down as a classic) but also some genuine scares (the bathroom in particular remains in the memory).<br/><br/>Lots of cool sound effects and editing (a la Spaced) combined great writing and acting give the film a very slick feel which certainly belie its (presumably) low budget.<br/><br/>Clearly a loving homage, there is nothing here for the snootier horror fan to get upset about.  One thought though:  as this is the first film shouldn't it have been called 'Dwight of the Living Dead'??<br/><br/>
Unreservedly recommended."

","Being a massive Spaced fan i was lucky enough to get free tickets to the preview of this movie.  i was extremely keen to see it and for that reason i think i may have been a bit disappointed with what i saw.<br/><br/>without giving too much away, it's pretty much spaced plus zombies, minus Brian, and daisy only having the smallest of parts.  there's some other familiar faces in there too, from the likes of The Office and others. plot wise it's pretty much a none event but if you're like me you won't care. i watch these actors because they make me laugh and they've pretty much succeeded again.  the only down side for me was that the laughs weren't more sustained and serious moments kept popping up towards the end.<br/><br/>all in all, not a bad effort by simon pegg and his mates.  i'd say 4 out of 5 and you should find it funny regardless of how much you've been following this bunch, provided you have a sense of humour that is.<br/><br/>Role on Spaced series 3 it'll make a lot of people very happy including me!"

","Just got back from a screening of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and just have to say that the film was fantastic. There was only a few people in the screening but they were all laughing, even the people who came in by mistake, thinking it was Gothika (though they'll probably laugh just as hard at that!)<br/><br/>Simon Pegg was brilliant as was the supporting cast (filled with Brit Comedy cameos)and the movie was filled with real moments of sadness and pathos, which is welcome in this genre. I watched the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" the day before and this movie, although enjoyable, is not a patch on ""shaun"". Can't wait to see it again with a full audience. (especially the part where they beat the landlord at the local pub with pool cues all to the tune of Queen's ""Don't Stop Me Now"". Legendary) Pegg was asked in an English magazine about the chances of a sequel, to which he replied ""From Dusk Till Shaun""! Can't wait to see if he does it!"
