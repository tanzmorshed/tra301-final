"gogarrett","9","73","103","24 January 2015"," Excellent and moving film
","We had to see this movie after so many conflicting things were said about it. I did not go in with high expectations and was surprised to find that everything about the movie was excellent, from the casting, costumes, and sets, to the filming, script, directing, lighting effects and music. It all worked for me. I was moved and upset in all the right places, from the shocking beginning to the triumphant, and also foreboding end. The cutting in of actual film footage towards the end was welcome and not overdone or trivialized. Kind of like, let's slip the audience back into reality now. This was real. It really happened and people kept on fighting and dying for civil rights in America after the events of this movie. <br/><br/>I loved it. It should have gotten more Academy Award nominations than it did. Especially for the actors who played Martin and Coretta King. I can't believe they are not even Amerian actors. Nicely done accents. The actor who played LBJ was also very good, but being from Texas I was not as convinced by his accent. If I was on the Board for the Academy Awards I definitely would nominate this movie for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress - at minimum."
"trublu215","4","149","241","9 December 2014"," A good MLK biopic that could have been great.
","Selma tells the story of Martin Luther King as he organizes the infamous marches during the height of the civil rights movement. To be fair, Selma is a good film. It isn't a great film, but it is good. David Oyelowo gives a great performance as MLK despite feeling like a bit of a miscast but it isn't enough to sustain interest in his character, which is shameful considering the great and brilliant man that he is portraying. All in all, Oyelowo doesn't pack the punch that we all want to see out of a MLK based film. At 122 minutes, this film wallows in cheap drama surrounded by some serious heavyweight performances, it creates an uneven balance between what is great and what is mediocre. Actor Tim Roth does great work here in portraying the ruthless and racist George Wallace. Roth delivers an evil performance that will turn your stomach with every syllable that spews out of his mouth. Roth does a great, outstanding job in making you hate him and I definitely give him high praise in this film. Another stand out performance is Carmen Ejogo, who portrays Coretta Scott King with such honesty and velocity that she's hard to ignore. Ejogo's performance is one that I continuously am thinking about even as I'm writing this. The supporting cast is huge in this film, featuring Tom Wilkinson, Cuba Gooding Jr, Giovanni Ribisi, Common and Oprah Winfrey. But just because the star power is here, doesn't mean they're all good. Honestly, the supporting cast outside of Tim Roth and Common are mediocre at best. Oprah Winfrey delivers a performance that we've seen multiple times over the course of her acting career. It is nothing new, especially because it feels she is just rehashing the same performance from last year's The Butler or from the much superior The Color Purple. Winfrey serves as more of a distraction than anything else. Common is awesome in this film in a small but crucial role to what Oyelowo's King wants to achieve. Common proved before that he can act, but here, he proves that he isn't just another rapper turned actor, he really delivers force to this film with blunt and swift justice. The screenplay here is Selma's downfall. Written by first time screenwriter, Paul Webb, it really feels like Webb's first rodeo, making classic first time mistakes between cheesy dialog and long drawn out scenes that, in retrospect, serve little purpose to the film as a whole. Despite these issues with the screenplay, it was in the most capable hands possible for this film...Ava DuVernay. While there are major pacing issues with the film, DuVernay directs this with a determined efficiency that oozes out of every second of the film. While this can't save Selma from falling casualty to a lot of clich√© scenes and cheesy dialog, she does make up for all of what's wrong with the film with a handful of great performances and awesome cinematography. Overall, Selma is nowhere near the Oscar contender that I wanted it to be nor is it the biopic that a man as great as Martin Luther King, Jr deserves but Selma is a decent film that reminds me more of Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X"" or Lee Daniels' ""The Butler"" rather than last year's instant classic ""12 Years a Slave"". It's a good movie, nothing more, nothing less."
"drawlife","9","52","87","20 January 2015"," Fueled by a gripping performance from Oyelowo.
","Film critic Richard Roeper said it best. Selma is a film that provides a history lesson, but doesn't feel like a history lecture. Not one bit. <br/><br/>I foresee a bright future for the director Ava DuVernay and actor David Oyelowo. For DuVernay's second or third effort, it's quite an achievement what she manages to do with this film. For nearly fifteen years she's been working in studio marketing and publicity and her film speaks for itself. She directs the film with flare and keeps the film emotionally grounded. Even though at times you think you know whats coming, DuVernay keeps us at bay and also provides us with some neat surprises. Also give Paul Webb some credit with his sharp screenplay. <br/><br/>David Oyelowo truly embodies MLK. More often than not Selma tends to focus on something not many people tend to expect in a movie about MLK. The script showcases his doubts and insecurities. Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and compelling performance. He also nails Dr. King's speech patterns, voice, even his posture and shows that Dr. King has his flaws, but is a compassionate person. I find it hard that anyone will be able to take their eyes off him. What a performance. Shame that it was overlooked by the Academy. <br/><br/>Everyone in the cast brings their ""A-game."" I liked Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, but I wanted just a little more of her character, but she makes up the most of what she has. Oprah Winfrey is solid as Annie Lee Cooper. She has a very substantial role and has a nice subplot. Other particular standouts are Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Tim Roth as George Wallace. <br/><br/>Selma takes itself very seriously, there isn't much humor to be found, and any break from documenting its events are often downbeat character moments. However DuVernay's talent is in full blaze. This film is very heavy, but it always grabs your attention, often in the hands of Oyelowo's performance. The March 7th, ""Bloody Sunday"" sequence is brutal to watch, but DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young achieve and deliver quite an intense and impactful set piece. Literally, it hits you in the gut as we watch history forged in flesh and blood.<br/><br/>I am still shocked that this film received so little recognition by the Academy. Oyelowo and DuVernay should have been nominated at the very least. I believe you can blame that to Paramount Pictures as I heard that they did not deliver the screeners on time for the Academy voters. It's a pity. <br/><br/>By the time we arrive at the film's postscript, revealing the fates of several people chronicled by Selma, it's almost impossible not to be moved by their courage and sacrifice. Selma to me, is not just a biopic, but rather a film that celebrates a community action through the eyes of Martin Luther King Jr. This movie sadly, could not be more relevant right now. <br/><br/>9.3/10"
"valen060","9","38","63","23 January 2015"," Captivating Portrayal of the Civil Rights Leader and Intensely Moving Story
","The words I best describe this movie are ""profound"" and ""intense."" From what I've learned since my school days, equal rights among race was a very touchy subject when it came to American history.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo's portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. was so spot-on that I was immediately drawn in to see every detail of the film play out. I was disturbed and further curious at the same time amongst every scene that unfolded during the key moments of the film.<br/><br/>Basically, it featured how much King sacrificed and went through in the 1960s to maintain blacks rights to vote and eliminate segregation from all states. I couldn't believe how much violent injustice and racial discrimination were used to intimidate innocent people who were trying to have the same rights like many in America.<br/><br/>Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr, and rapper-actor Common brought out great performances as the individuals who stood up for what they truly believe in and they wouldn't let hate stand in their way. Tom Wilkinson's portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson was rather physically uncanny and his scenes brought out the angst of what he had to face at a time when violence was further escalating during the Civil Rights Movement. Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace made me feel to hate the man for his segregationist beliefs, but when confronted by President Johnson himself, it just got real.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of real-life archive footage in the movie gave a nice touch to how very genuine these people of Selma endured plenty of horrible confrontations. Whether these usually ended in violence or even death, they just kept growing in numbers and overcome all who stood against their true beliefs in racial equality.<br/><br/>My only nitpick was that of President Johnson's confrontations with Martin Luther King himself. I've learned in the history books that they've had their fair share of disagreements, but nothing this intense as shown on screen. Nevertheless, it proved that being an American President was no easy feat at a very difficult time. Overall, this is a film that didn't require lengthy (moving) MLK speeches, instead it focused on tense confrontations black people had to endure and how one individual stood tall and fought back not with violence, but with powerful words and strong beliefs. I applaud David Oyelowo and director Ava DuVernay for providing a glimpse into how racism was overcome by one profound man whose legacy still reverberates to this day."
"chrisdmoller","5","15","22","26 January 2015"," OK entertainment, not so good history
","If you are looking for entertainment about the civil rights era (a real challenge if you know anything about the civil rights period), and you have no problems with the historical revisionism of the movie, then this is a film you might like. Although I find the idea of making an entertaining film about one of the ugliest periods of American history a fool's errand, I guess the director is entitled to make the attempt to entertain us. . On the other hand, given that the subject matter of the film is the pivotal, dramatic, and violent clashes involving the racist political structures of Selma and Alabama, and the key players of the civil rights movement, one would think that the directory and screen play would capitalize on these dramatic historical events in a compelling retelling of this part of American history. They failed to tell history truthfully. . I had heard about the problems in the portrayal of LBJ in the film, but I didn't realize that historical time lines were also tinkered with for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERTS ***<br/><br/>The film starts with Coretta and Martin just before his Nobel award in October of 1964, and then the second scene jumps back more than a year to September of 1963 and the ""16th Street Baptist Church bombing"" where 4 young girls were killed (there is no subtitle to clue in the audience that these scenes were more than a year earlier). They used his 1964 Nobel speech to juxtapose against events that appear to happen at the same time.<br/><br/>It was clear right from the beginning that the writer and director were not interested in historical accuracy, they were interested in creating their own mythology around historical events. The historical inaccuracy characterizing LBJ as dead set against civil rights and voting rights for blacks is proof that the makers of this film have an agenda to lionize and then canonize MLK. The problem I with the film makers is that don't have to lie about the facts to convince us that MLK was a great man.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you are looking for entertainment, there are a lot of other popcorn films that are far better. For history on the civil rights era, better check out the PBS documentary series ""Eyes on the Prize"" (1987 six one hour episodes) and the follow up second season in 1990 of eight one hour episodes)."
"samdlugach","5","29","49","30 January 2015"," A movie-of-the-week.
","Selma is a movie-of-the-week that didn't have to be. That an African-American woman, Ava DuVernay, directed this story is surely praiseworthy and a long time coming, but one wishes she'd realized the picture with more subtle strokes. Yes, there are a handful of beautifully poignant moments, some unspoken, but those are nearly neutralized by scenes where the dialog is so stilted with the weight of self-importance that ordinary folks sound like they're making speeches during private conversations.<br/><br/>Visually, the desaturated sepia look of the picture confuses. Are we watching a historical document, or are we present in the moment of 1965 with its arguably more vibrant palette? Superimposed FBI logbook entries (as scene headers) cheapen the movie and bring to mind 1970s televised crime drama. In these and other production decisions, DuVernay undermines her own noble effort.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the story does move, and the inevitable violence that pushes forward the Voting Rights Act is brutal and affecting. The film's best moments come from Henry G. Sanders as Cager Lee, and between David Oyelowo and Tom Wilkinson as MLK and LBJ."
"supersohail","3","77","147","1 January 2015"," Good Acting but Unfortunately Inaccurate
","David Oyelowo played a spectacular MLK. The drama was good and it kept me entertained...like The Expendables. The movie was strongly fictionalized, unfortunately tarnishing its historical accuracy. This would have been a great movie even if it had stuck to the historical record but for Hollywood reasons (sensationalism; promoting racial discord; etc) the writer actively ""reimagined"" LBJs relationship with MLK to promote the idea of MLK fighting on all fronts - even against the all-powerful President who stands in his way. In fact (with plenty of recorded phone conversations, and MLKs words to back it up) LBJ and MLK worked closely in tandem to orchestrate the Civil Rights Act in '64 and Voting Rights Act in '65. This is not even debated - it's known and well recorded and understood. The fact that the film presented the opposite of the truth in this regard - for box office sales no less - is unfortunate indeed. For those who turn to Hollywood for history lessons they will see an entertaining movie but learn very little."
"NanoFrog","4","58","111","19 January 2015"," Something is Missing, Flat
","Something, hard to define, is missing in this important film. This film takes the viewer on a journey to Selma Alabama at the crucial time of the Civil Rights movement that took place during the life of Martin Luther King. It covers the important facts, describing clearly the sad situation that people of color faced in trying to register to vote in the segregated south. Even today, the efforts by white-dominated election boards make it more and more difficult for people of color to register and make their votes in the old south. The actor playing Dr. King, in my view, is one of the serious problems this film has. He seems to do a good job, but something serious is missing. The fact that he is not an American is part of this problem. There is something artificial about his acting. It is technically sound, yet lacks some deeper presentation of the driven, inspiring personality that defined Dr. King. Perhaps the problem is in the context. We don't really see any sense of the history that lead to this confrontation. The beat down on the bridge is, in my view, poorly filmed and does very little to capture the full outrage, violence and terror of that event. Certainly this is a difficult scene to set up and record, but Hollywood is very well-equipped to do things like this. A lot has been made of the so-called snubbing of Oprah in this film. She has a small part in the beginning of the film, a scene that could have been played by anyone. The scene where she tries to register to vote, while being questioned and intimidated by a series of crazy questions from the voter registrar is very helpful in telling us what this film is about. There is nothing exceptional about her small part, so I see no cause at all for her to imagine that for such a small part she should be nominated for an Academy Award. The very idea seems really childish. A lot of facts were left out, or glossed over; so an enormous opportunity seems to have been lost. Selma is a good film about the civil rights movement, but not a great film. It is flat, the lead actors are not very interesting and the script, in particular, seems half- finished. It comes across as a rough draft of an idea for a film rather than a finished product. I was very disappointed in this film. In particular I did not like the actors playing Doctor King or President Johnson. The photography, the camera work, as well was not very good...flat and dry. Perhaps we all have inflated expectations. This is such an important and dramatic story; yet it was created and presented in a very un-inspired form with to many missing parts. The part I absolutely did not like at all in any way is the ""song"" that closes the film. The semi-rap composition was very disrespectful and tried much to hard to be ""relevant"". And the fact that it is one of the few points on which it was nominated by the Academy, as ""best song"" is just sad."
"reelinspiration","9","22","38","21 January 2015"," Selma: The Courageous March for Civil Rights - why it is still relevant today.)
","I went away from the screening feeling empowered to write an inspiring review of, ""Selma."" I was deeply moved by the image of marchers from diverse religions, black and white, standing together against injustice and inhumanity. These people risked their lives for the rights we enjoy today. And the themes are still so relevant in this time of racial discord and disillusionment with those in power. <br/><br/>Then there was the controversy around the accuracy of the film's depiction of President Lyndon Johnson as a deterrent to the march at Selma. Director Ava DuVernay explained that it was her artistic vision. She suggested that people research it for themselves. After doing my own research, I found that President Johnson's involvement was not black and white. He was first and foremost a Southern politician. I believe that, ""Selma,"" is DuVernay's honest take on the events. Her vision is to invite the audience into the spirit of the movement from the point of view of its black protagonists. It was greater than just one man. It was a community coming together to figure out the best way to accomplish their civil rights objectives.<br/><br/>The movie shows how African-Americans were humiliated, threatened with losing their jobs, beaten or even killed for attempting to vote in the South. A group of civil rights activists, including Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo), decide that the best course of action is to fight for the unobstructed right to vote. King meets with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to request that he pass the Voting Rights Act. But the president's goal is to keep a handle on the civil rights movement and he is only interested in uncovering King's next course of action. He claims that there is too much on his plate, including fighting poverty, to pass a Voting Rights Act.<br/><br/>The activists decide to bring attention to the issue by holding a non-violent demonstration in Selma, Alabama. As the protesters kneel down before Sheriff Jim Clark, a police officer strikes an elderly man who has difficulty kneeling. When two protesters intervene to protect the man, the police respond with a vicious attack. The protesters flee, but the policemen are unrelenting in their pursuit. One young man helps his family escape into a restaurant, where they pretend to be eating. The policemen track them down and shoot the young man in cold blood. Spurred on by this tragedy, the community rallies together. They organize a non-violent march from Selma.<br/><br/>When the peaceful marchers reach the end of a bridge, Sheriff Jim Clark is waiting for them. He sics his armed state troopers on the marchers. The nation watches, horrified, as the marchers are savagely beaten as white citizens cheer. Martian Luther King sends out a call to his fellow clergy to stand with him as they march again. Moved by the inhumanity, they come to show their support. It is inspiring to see black and white people from all religions joining arms and standing together.<br/><br/>The reason I wanted to include the excerpt from his Montgomery speech is that it still rings true today. Martin Luther King educates the nation on how after the emancipation, the Southern aristocracy was afraid of the freed slaves organizing with the poor whites for better working conditions, so they passed the Jim Crow segregation laws to separate them. The inherent message was no matter how low the white man was, the blacks were lower. (Not unlike how our current politicians use undocumented immigrants as scapegoats, blaming them for causing the recession by taking the poor man's jobs.)<br/><br/>Witnessing the inhumane treatment of the blacks at the march in Selma created more understanding of the plight of African Americans - which allowed President Lyndon Johnson to finally pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965. I hope witnessing these events will remind us of the difficult battle that was waged to achieve these rights, so we won't allow them to be taken away.<br/><br/>Movie blessings! Reel Inspiration dot blogspot dot com<br/><br/>I will be writing about Director Ava DuVernay in an upcoming Reel Inspiration post on ""Women Directors."""
"Turfseer","4","26","47","27 January 2015"," Grim Oyelowo is miscast as MLK in this preachy, by-the-numbers hagiography
","Director Ava DuVernay has mainly been criticized for her depiction of President Johnson as being a reluctant or obstructionist political actor. DuVernay was quoted as saying that she wasn't interested in making a ""white savior movie,"" perhaps implying that Johnson has been given too much credit for his role in the civil rights movement. DuVernay admits that not everything in ""Selma"" is historically accurate, but she's entitled to fictionalize events under the rubric of ""dramatic license.""<br/><br/>Indeed, the most compelling scenes in the film appear to be those involving Johnson's political machinations. DuVernay would like to us to believe that King and Johnson's relationship was much more confrontational than it was. Joseph Califano Jr., a former LBJ top assistant for domestic affairs, points to a recorded phone conversation between King and LBJ on January 15, 1965 in which LBJ appeared to be much more constructive than confrontational.<br/><br/>However, DuVernay attempted to justify her portrayal of LBJ as a reluctant actor, citing a 2013 article by Louis Menand in ""The New Yorker."" Menand maintained that Johnson was not proactive after progress toward getting the Voting Rights Act passed had slowed: ""Johnson had the most ambitious legislative agenda of any President since F.D.R. (his idol), and he explained to King that he was worried that Southern opposition to more civil-rights legislation would drain support from the War on Poverty and hold up bills on Medicare, immigration reform, and aid to education. He asked King to wait. King thought that if you waited for the right time for direct action (as nonviolent protests were called) you would never act.""<br/><br/>In DuVernay's best scene, LBJ finally ""comes around"" and tells off George Wallace face to face. What's so great about this scene is how LBJ attempts to appeal to Wallace on his level, even employing the ""N"" word to show Wallace that he's just a ""good old boy"" at heart. But when Wallace won't listen to reason, LBJ makes it clear that the days of the Old South are numbered.<br/><br/>DuVernay undoubtedly would have liked Johnson to come around sooner and attempts to slightly steal his thunder in his famous ""We Shall Overcome"" speech by having him speak before a sparsely populated House of Representatives (Bill Moyers insists that the chamber was completely packed and LBJ's speech was ""electric"").<br/><br/>The rest of ""Selma"" is pretty much in part, a by the numbers hagiography. DuVernay chose David Oyelowo, a British actor who starred in her earlier feature, ""Middle of Nowhere,"" to play Martin Luther King Jr. Oyelowo is sadly miscast playing King as a grim-faced, stoic preacher, failing to convey a shred of King's warmth or humanity. For those who wish to see the definitive portrait of King, they can find it by viewing the 1978 TV Miniseries: ""King"", starring the sensational Paul Winfield. There is no comparison between the two performances and one can find the entire Winfield miniseries on Youtube under the films of Paul Winfield.<br/><br/>DuVernay is more successful when she sticks to straightforward historical events. There's a compelling scene when Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper is rebuffed by a racist clerk when she attempts to register to vote at the county courthouse. Coretta Scott King has little to do in ""Selma"" so I suppose her meeting with a seemingly muted Malcolm X proves to be her character's most exciting scene. The revelation that King was still miffed by Malcolm X's earlier claim that he was an ""Uncle Tom,"" also proves to be quite fascinating. The two confrontations with the racist police in Selma are competently done, but I can't help once again recommending the Winfield miniseries, as the police-protester clashes there, seem more realistic.<br/><br/>Except for a memorable confrontation where Andrew Young talks down a vengeful crowd of dispirited King demonstrators, the ""supporting players"" simply don't stand out. This is particularly evident when King is greeted by his staff at the safe house in Selma (by the way, this is about the only time you see Oyelowo smile during the entire movie).<br/><br/>Eschewing a ""warts and all"" approach, DuVernay puts her MLK on a pedestal. There's little hint of the ""family man"" or charismatic leader. DuVernay unfortunately was hampered (stymied if you will) by the King family, who always demand financial remuneration whenever any of his speeches are used in fictional portraits such as ""Selma."" DuVernay paraphrased King's speeches, but little of it sounds spoken by the great man!<br/><br/>Adolph Reed Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania implies that DuVernay ""inscribes a monolithic and trans-historical racism as the fundamental obstacle confronting, and thus uniting, all black Americans."" One can't but help note that DuVernay believes that there's a continuity between the protests of the civil rights era and the recent protests in Ferguson. While the Civil Rights Era was a monumental and seminal part of American history, to equate Martin Luther King's non-violent movement with the events that occurred in Ferguson, seems absurd. To my mind, MLK probably would have rolled over in his grave had he seen the pathetic and self-destructive acts by those who were caught on camera rioting in Ferguson.<br/><br/>Even though murders of blacks by police are statistically extremely low, media exposure has convinced many people that this happens all the time. While African-Americans were true victims of endemic racism until the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s, the cries of victimhood today, especially in regards to ""police brutality."" are not clear-cut. Some police may be outwardly racist as well as ""heavy-handed"" or ""insensitive."" But recent events have also proved that some African- Americans intentionally provoke the police, leading to tragic overreactions."
"clark-andy","5","12","19","10 February 2015"," Disappointing
","I saw some reviews of this movie that varied quite a bit, which should have been a warning. Have you noticed how, generally speaking, a movie's rating starts of as 'x' and then declines gradually before settling down? is this because a brand new movie is exciting but later when it isn't new the ratings become more accurate? This movie is difficult to rate as the subject matter is so interesting; I was about 18 when it all happened so remembered it pretty well. The problem is that so much of the content is a series of conversations set in a rather murky background (to make it look like 1960s?). Many/most of the conversations are frankly rather tedious... so much so that I actually fell asleep for short while, somewhere in the middle of the movie. I was never quite sure what they were trying to tell me about the relationship between MLK & his wife..some bits of the movie good, most of it not so good.<br/><br/>To sum up, pretty disappointing."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","16","27","13 February 2015"," A bridge too far for Civil Rights
","Last year's ""Pride"" brilliantly demonstrated how far gay rights have come in the UK in 30 years. Selma does an equally superb job in showing how far racial equality has come in the US in 50 years.<br/><br/>The year is 1964 and racial tension is rife in the Southern states, with attacks and murders of black citizens going unpunished by the combination of a white-majority policing and legal system. Enter Martin Luthor King (English actor David Oyelowo) at the point of receiving his Nobel Peace prize. King insists at a Presidential level (with Tom Wilkinson playing Lyndon Johnson) that black citizens be allowed unfettered rights to vote in elections, with the aim of securing a more just and balanced society. Looking for a suitable location to mount a media-led stand, in an age before social networking and 'Arab-Springs', King centres his attention on the Alabama town of Selma, mounting a series of non-violent (at least on their side) protests and marches. The local redneck police chief, Wilson Baker (David Dwyer), and the state governor, George Wallis (Tim Roth), are not going to stand for this and the tinder-box reaches ignition point during a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery.<br/><br/>Nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture (but only that in the major awards, so winning chances are probably near-zero), Selma is primarily an excellent example of an ensemble cast that works particularly well together. There are a wealth of outstanding performances: Tom Wilkinson's Lyndon Johnson comes across as a surprisingly sympathetic character (jerking me out of my natural Vietnam-coloured perception of the politician); Oprah Winfrey (also a co-producer) provides a text-book example of acting without acting, her expressions doing all of the work; Dylan Baker (so fantastic in ""The Good Wife"") is chillingly sinister as J. Edgar Hoover; English-born Carmen Ejogo plays (extremely well) a similar role to Sienna Miller's in ""American Sniper"" as the wife alienated by her husband's calling; and Giovanni Ribisi (""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Friends""), Cuba Gooding Jnr and (a bizarrely uncredited) Martin Sheen turn up in great cameo performances.<br/><br/>But towering over all of this great acting is Oyelowo's performance which is simply outstanding: every death and injury is etched on his face. This is a Martin Luthor King that you can really believe in. I would have personally bounced Bradley Cooper in the nomination list for him, and it is astonishing (given his English background) that he was also overlooked at the BAFTAs. He must be feeling pretty aggrieved right now. Mr Oyelowo ‚Äì if you are reading this ‚Äì this critic thanks you for an outstanding performance.<br/><br/>As a relative newcomer to direction, at least for a movie of this scale, Ava Duvernay does a great job with some of the action scenes (with particularly the shocking opening to the film showing enormous style). Paul Webb (apparently with this as a screen writing debut ‚Äì ‚Äì how on earth did he get THIS job?) does a creditable job, with lots of memorable sound-bites that stick in the mind. Where the film ran into soft mud for me however was in the personal scenes between the married couple: they don't really provide enough insight into the stresses of King's serial adultery, and the plotting becomes slow and dull¬Ö. I personally lost interest in most of these scenes and was desperate for the film to get back to the 'action' in Selma.<br/><br/>Also of note is the end title song ‚Äì ""Glory"" by John Legend and Common (who also stars in the film) ‚Äì which is also nominated for an Oscar and won the Golden Globe.<br/><br/>Both gay rights and racial equality undoubtedly still have much further to go, but this does make you proud that as US and UK societies we have come so far within my own lifetime. A recommended watch, particularly for those with an interest in sociology and/or American history.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

"Sploich","3","26","49","18 February 2015"," Review - Selma (2014)
","As Cinemark's Oscar Movie Week reaches its midway point, we come to possibly the most controversial film in the running for Best Picture this year. A lot of people are confused as to why Selma was only nominated for Best Picture and Best Original Song. Frankly, I don't think it should have been nominated for either.<br/><br/>First of all, from what I understand, the reason it was ""snubbed"" (I really hate that word, by the way) is because the studio was late in releasing its screeners to voters. It seems that most people just never saw the movie because of this and the fact that it had a sparse release in the first place. So how did it get nominated for Best Picture? I can only imagine it was word-of-mouth. People said it deserved it, so maybe voters wrote it in to give it a chance, and it just so happened to knock Gone Girl and Foxcatcher out to edge its way in.<br/><br/>Selma may be the first major studio production depicting the life of Martin Luther King Jr., but there is nothing original or even remarkable about this film. It has the production value of a made- for-TV movie and the acting to match. It's better than something as abysmally idiotic as The Butler, and it's not as politically manipulative as something like Fruitvale Station.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Selma is to the civil rights movement what countless religious movies are to religion. Even if it has heart and its intentions are pure, which I do believe they are, the production quality just isn't enough to make it relative or persuasive. The politicians are flat and their interactions are repetitive. The movie follows a pattern of King arguing with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), followed by King talking to his wife, followed by a protest, followed by King returning to Johnson. It just goes on and on like that for the duration of the film with not a whole lot being accomplished or progressing.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is not a bad actor, but he does not make an inspirational King, and virtually nothing King does in the film has any bearing on the story. The plot only moves forward when outside forces effect the situation. I feel like that's an injustice to King, to not make it more clear and apparent that what he was doing and saying was an important factor in getting to where we are today.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have made a film that ended with King getting his Nobel Prize rather than opening with it. The fact is that the Selma story just isn't very interesting. If it had been the climax to a story of the entire journey, it could have made for an epic, emotional conclusion. Instead, the movie is just a drawn out mess of repetitious preaching."
"alanjj","4","14","24","3 February 2015"," Its central premise is slanderously wrong--if that were not true, it'd be great
","Even if Joseph Califano hadn't made the point, I would have been appalled by the portrayal of LBJ in this film, since I'm old enough to remember LBJ. The CENTRAL PREMISE of this film is that MLK had to do something dramatic, and even court tragedy, in order to convince a reluctant LBJ to push the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That is the ""drama"" on which this entire historical fiction hinges. The climax comes when fictional LBJ changes his mind, having witnessed what local authorities did, and what Gov. George Wallace allowed, on a bridge outside Selma. LBJ then makes an address to Congress, the bill is passed, and everyone praises MLK for making it happen.<br/><br/>As Califano said, ""Selma was LBJ's idea, he considered the Voting Rights Act his greatest legislative achievement, he viewed King as an essential partner in getting it enacted ‚Äî and he didn't use the FBI to disparage him.""<br/><br/>I don't mind when liberties are taken with historical fact in the interests of making a good film. I've defended ""The Imitation Game"" despite various distortions--the central premise, that a math wiz named Turing made it possible for the Brits to crack the Enigma code, that he conceived of computers as we now know them, and that he was persecuted for his homosexuality, are true beyond dispute (although other events were involved in breaking the code).<br/><br/>But Selma's key dramatic element, it's emotional core, is based on well- known and well-remembered historical fact, and it is a lie. The filmmakers say that the film is a dramatic story, and that they have taken liberties, yet they make it seem, by the use of a teletype device at the bottom of the screen, that they are recounting events contained in FBI wiretaps--the teletypes contain dates of particular events that we are seeing dramatized. It is a device that gives veracity to the tale.<br/><br/>Of course, it's just a film, and the filmmakers are not responsible for the impressions of history conveyed who don't know it, but I could sense that the young people in the auditorium where I saw the film were emotionally invested in seeing LBJ as a villain. An audible gasp arise when LBJ, speaking with George Wallace, referred to the ""Nigras""; I saw a person near me shaking his head, as though the N word had been said. If LBJ were alive and if public figures were able to sue for defamation, he would have a case against this defamatory motion picture.<br/><br/>So why did I give it any ""stars"" in this rating system? Because, other than the central premise, it was a terrific movie. David Oyelowo is a magnificent actor. The speeches written for him to deliver, in lieu of the actual speeches which they were not given the rights too, were powerful, and delivered with such sincerity and force that you wanted to go out and march behind Oyelowo. The director did not ignore MLK's affairs with other women, but portrayed him and Coretta talking about them, dealing with them as adults. There is a recognition of MLK as a flesh-and-blood human, as well as a person who was able to recognize, in himself, that he was in a position where he could change the world. The scenes of freedom marches were powerful and exciting.<br/><br/>So, with the exception of its main story line, this movie is great. And because of falsity, the movie is slanderous."
"OldHaunts","5","14","24","18 January 2015"," Boring well acted film
","While a powerful story on paper and having been told better in other films, Selma is well acted by all (although Common looked very awkward and out of place) this film had no umph to it. It was an equal plateau that never finds its peak and ends without power. A great example of a trailer creating an idea of a film being action packed and full of conflict while the actual film is heavy laden with dialogue and undeveloped relationships. It's not a wonder why it was 'snubbed' for Oscar nominations. The John legend/Common song is also ridiculous considering the rest of the film is properly set in its period while this song is so modern it takes you out of the movie. Entertaining film yes but not worth the rush to theatres."
"bryank-04844","8","10","16","12 August 2015"," 'Selma' is a powerhouse of a film and stays with you long after you see it. Don't miss this film.
","It's no doubt that Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most influential people in the world. He fought for basic human rights, received a Nobel Peace Prize, and not only changed a nation for good, but changed the world. This film is not necessarily a biopic on iconic man, but rather a glimpse on a short period of time that focuses on the 1965 voting marches from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama, that was to ensure that anyone, no matter your race, color, creed, or religion, could have the right to vote.<br/><br/>These marches and peaceful demonstrations were well documented by the press back then and eventually led to President Lyndon B. Johnson changing the law so that everyone had to right to vote in any election without hassle. And this film 'Selma' shows us the hardships, violence, brilliance, and struggles of Martin and his followers and believers for a better place to live. It's an emotional roller coaster for sure, but with its award winning performance by David Oyelowo ('Interstellar') and great camera work, 'Selma' hits all the right notes, despite a few pacing problems.<br/><br/>We start out with Martin receiving his Nobel Peace Prize, as the master of ceremonies tells us and him that the world knows and loves the work he is doing. Once back in the states, Martin heads to the White House again to talk with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) about singing a law into effect to allow the black voters the right to vote without hassle, which Johnson doesn't do. Concurrently, while it is legal for the black population to vote, the law enforcement and people who work at the voter booths are not allowing them to vote for prejudice reasons, particularly in the South. That is when Martin and his people head to Selma to stage a demonstration until the law is passed.<br/><br/>Martin picks Selma, because he knows their law enforcement are violent assholes who have no love for human life, but are blinded by hatred for something they don't know. Knowing that his followers will show peaceful demonstrations and marches, he is willing to bet that the white law enforcement will show brutal violence with the hopes of these acts of chaos will be shown on live TV for the world to see, forcing the President to make a move. His strategy worked, but not without some pain and sorrow.<br/><br/>Director Ava Duvernay shows us just how horrible and violent these marches were, and it's hard to watch in certain moments as we ask ourselves, ""Were we really capable of this?"" And we quickly think, ""Yes, and it still goes on today."" The main issue I had with 'Selma' was that were too many moments that slowed the film down due to a long shot of someone looking intense into the camera or into the wide open. I get why these moments were there, but it seemed to happen after each scene. But it's a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent film.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr. flawlessly. Not only do we see his strengths in speeches and rallying people for good, but we also see his internal struggle with his family and own willingness to carry out his life's work. Oyelowo definitely deserves some awards for this role. Thee rest of the cast including, Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Giovanni Ribisi, Oprah Winfrey, Keith Stanfield, Wendell Pierce, Martin Sheen, and Cuba Gooding Jr. all turn in amazing performances. 'Selma' is a powerhouse of a film and stays with you long after you see it. Don't miss this film."
"ironhorse_iv","8","11","18","29 January 2015"," Let Freedom Ring! Selma is a highly engaging film about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. It's a must-watch.
","Selma, might not be in the running for any 2015 Academy Award categories, but the snubbing, wouldn't stop the film from being a captivating portrayal of the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965, when Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. Seeing this play out on film was indeed a great watch. With an array of wide shots and gliding camera-work, under gospel and melancholy score, director Ava DuVernay delivers. You really get how the admired leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his followers prompted change. Oyelowo really digs deep in the role of M.L.K. He play King with a wide acting range; from being grand speaker of sermons, to him, playing the quiet defeatism when it come to confronted by his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) about his infidelity or his misjudgment when it comes to how the Civil Rights, should be run. A scene where the lively group sits down for a home-cooked meal even show a charming human side of Martin Luther King Jr, that's rare to see. It was great to see, Oyelowo overcome, years of being typecast as the over the top angry black man in these racial dealing movies. I was really glad, that Oyelowo fought very hard for 7 years to get the role of King, and found a way to get his biggest critic, Lee Daniels, the original director attached, off the project, because, in my opinion, I found Lee Daniels to be a really horrible director. Most of the supporting characters were pretty great in their roles. This movie allows Carmen Ejogo to play Coretta Scott King, a second time and she just as good as her performance in 2001's TV Movie, 'Boycott'. The historical accuracy of the film's story has been the subject of controversy, particularly with regard to Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson and his relationship with King. The film portrayal of Johnson is indeed, less flattering than it should be, accusing the president for being a time-wasting political leader that allow the FBI to monitor and harass King, on his watch. Maybe, there is some truth to that, but I really like how Tom Wilkinson portray him as a very complex character with way too much political problems to handled, at one time. Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace was wonderful. I love the tense scene between him and LBJ. Still, there were some characters that didn't get much of film time. In Depth examine of characters like Viola Liuzzo (Tara Ochs), seem to missing. The movie end credits, makes it seem like she was a big character in the film, but you rarely see that. I like Oprah Winfrey's bit part in the film as Annie Lee Cooper. It seems like she was a big part of the film, but she rarely mention, toward the end. Other mainstream actors like Cuba Gooding Jr. as Fred Gray and Dylan Baker as J. Edgar Hoover should had been cut out of the film, because they couldn't act, even in their short scenes. Even big historical characters like Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), seem lost in the odd pacing of the film. We see him, talking to Coretta, about joining the movement, and its leads to nothing. Later in the film, King mention that he was assassinate, a few weeks early, but there was no scene with him, getting whacked off. There was little to no reason, why he was brought in the story, because his character play so little to the Selma movement success. DuVernay's movie structure is indeed, bit off. The movie make it seem that the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing of 1963, happen during King receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. I know, Ava DuVernay did this for a story telling stand-forth, and it kinda works, but for anybody that know history. These small changes can be, a bit jarring. While, the movie isn't a documentary, and I'm willing to take artistic license. I just thought, maybe they could had patch up, some of these gaping holes and make it a lot focus driven film. Racism is difficult to depict on screen. Even at its most realistic, it can seem cartoonish in modern context. At times, the movie seem a bit harsh when portraying White Southerners. I really doubt, that they're all racists. The film makes it seem like the good whites folks came from the North, all to support, the Civil Rights movement, after seeing the brutal attacks at that Bridge. That's hardly the truth. There were a lot of White Southerners followers within MLK's group even before that event. Overall: Some people think this film was just create to stir the already tense race issue, since recent events like the Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant and Michael Brown's shootings have put people already on the edge. Because of movies like this is why there is so much racism in society because animosity never goes away. Certain black groups will be always eyeful and paranoia. White people will feel unwanted, and feel with guilt. We get it already. Racism is bad. Yes, a lot of movies feature black actors, focus way too much on the race card. There are other issues, black people go through. The subject that's never brought up which is more relevant is class. Racism is tied to classism. I think the movie kinda hints at that. So, it get some credit. While, this movie on the surface, seems like throwing fuel in the racial-tensions fire. I glad that films like this exist. Even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. They help people know, about their history and encourage them to more positively impact their future through an attitude of compassion and a reverence for change and progress towards equality in a peaceful matter. This is one of the movie's greatest strengths and why it's a must-watch."

","Many times, films of a historical nature are hard to appreciate, as in most cases one knows the story and the outcome. All our lives we have read, heard of and some even experienced the efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King. There are many hours of footage, countless recounts of his modus operandi and volumes of writings that give insight into his minds. However, this film delves deeper than the King Jr. of Black History month, and gives you an experience with his humanity as a man.<br/><br/>Selma is quite possibly, the most powerful film ever to be made. It is very hard to describe with words, however, after leaving the theater I was obviously affected greatly by the depiction of the story behind the march from Selma to Montgomery. Director, Ava Duvernay, does an amazing job of capturing, what she refers to as, ""small moments"" that allows you to connect to the King Jr. character on a very intimate level. During a screening of the film, she spoke to this saying, ""I knew that by doing a movie on King, we would have to do speeches, and early on I obsessed about the speeches. However, when I got on set, I began to focus on how to best capture the small moments that showed King's humanity."" <br/><br/>In the film, King Jr., portrayed by David Oyelowo, experiences many emotions, not generally associated with the civil rights activist, including guilt, shame and defeat. Oyelowo does a masterful job of bringing these emotions to light in the most subtle way. When asked about his preparation for the role, he responded, ""I always knew I would portray King Jr. I studied him, read and watched all of the video I could. I had been fortunate enough to play opposite of one of my acting idols, Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln and see him take on the role as he did, so I did the same for King Jr. For three months, I became him. So much so that one night while looking in the mirror, I only saw King Jr., this may sound crazy, but I could not see myself.""<br/><br/>Other strong performances include Oprah Winfrey as civil rights activist, Annie Lee Cooper. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Andre Holland as Andrew Young, Lorraine Toussaint as civil rights activist, Amelia Boynton, Stephan James as John Lewis and Trai Byers as James Forman."
"KnightsofNi11","8","19","36","20 January 2015"," Far more important than entertaining
","Some of the darkest and saddest pieces of our history often make for the most compelling and powerful films of the year. Such is the case with Selma which takes us back to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, showing us the tragic strife that the African American community was put through. Selma focuses specifically on the voting rights movement where Dr. King and his followers led an historical march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to peacefully protest Alabama's segregated voting rights in order to obtain equality across the voting board. It's a startlingly relevant film that explores a time in US history many would prefer to forget, and one that challenges us to look at our modern day society and draw some disturbing connections. <br/><br/>Admittedly it is a little bit sad that a film about civil rights can still have so much relevance in 2015, but such is the way of prejudice and bigotry in all of its ever changing forms. Selma does a fantastic job at making this fight as real and accessible as possible, highlighting this struggle on a personal level for King and his associates. These events were well before my time, but as far as I know this film paints a very realistic picture of the time, from the look of the sets, the costumes, and the emotions and tensions filling the air. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, it's the portrayal of Dr. King that drives this film home. David Oyelowo is a powerhouse that carries this film with a startlingly accurate representation of the reverend; one that is filled to the brim with passion and poise, while also breaking down the larger than life illusion that surrounds the man, and bringing him down to earth as the very real and very flawed human being he actually was. His controversial decisions are touched upon in the film, as well as his infidelities which truly bring him to the human level. <br/><br/>It's a damn good thing that Oyelowo can carry this film, too, as the emotional prowess of the story relies solely on him. Selma is packed with a great supporting cast with everyone from Tom Wilkinson to Tim Roth to rapper Common, but there is no denying that all these supporting players play second fiddle to Oyelowo. If Oyelowo is at a 10 as the lead of the film the rest of the cast sits at an 8 across the board with no one character getting a lot of attention as the focus consistently remains on King. I would have liked to see some more attention turned towards the supporting cast, but with a biopic on one of the most influential names in American history you almost have to expect this. <br/><br/>Selma highlights a grim portion of our history, one so grim that it needs to be immortalized in film so that we don't forget the troubled history we came from. This is an incredibly important film about an incredibly important man. It's not something you watch for entertainment value and not something you watch over and over again, but it is something you need to watch to gain some highly accurate perception of a crucial time in history it is imperative we never forget."

Toward the end of the movie, his performance was so strong, if he was not actually shown on the screen, you couldn't tell if if was an old recording of MLK or David Oyelowo himself.<br/><br/>As for the story, yes, it was not ""historicly accurate,"" but it flowed well and Ava DuVernay and Paul Webb did a wonderful job of making it family friendly, which is very hard to do with such a sensitive subject. I would compare it to Disney's ""Remember The Titans"" on how they changed the story to make it more entertaining and also family friendly.<br/><br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this movie.

This is not for everyone with its talk heavy dialogue but for those who like slower films then this is for them. It doesn't have the same power as ""12 Years a Slave"" does though. Still, it's good for a few viewings and it is pretty moving at some parts. I was pretty entertained by this. A couple of the boring or slower scenes lost me but there weren't too many of them and most of them were only in the first hour. It did a good job capturing the ugliness of the 1960's with the marches and some other sequences of violence. If you want to see a history lesson on screen then you'll likely enjoy the film."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","12","22","23 January 2015"," An intelligent, resonate and expertly crafted piece, if a little dry.
","Poor Selma. This Oscar season is quite unsatisfying without being able to see Selma live up to its full potential had a proper awards campaign taken place. While I expected it to still do well with the Academy, instead it makes an appearance similar to Pride at the Golden Globes. Sitting (almost) alone in the Picture category representing a minority. At least it seems it'll win Best Song. There's two aspects that sorely deserved a nomination, with all due respect to their peers. One is David Oyelowo's performance as Martin Luther King Jr., who nails his articulate speeches with an arresting passion. Sparks fly in his hands and you can't take your eyes off him. The second is Ava DuVernay's direction, whose delicacy, intelligence, and gravitas shine on screen. I marvel at how she wrote those original speeches yet still demonstrates a remarkable restraint. Selma takes itself deadly seriously, there's not a lick of humour to be found, and any break from documenting its events are often downbeat character moments. <br/><br/>There's a reason - the critics weren't kidding when they said that Selma feels like a mirror to society today with the violence and unrest. It's almost disturbing, but it resonates stronger than I ever expected. The film may be very dry, but every time it starts to lull it grabs you back, often in Oyelowo's hands. The most rousing moments of the film are when people are joining arms to do something together. Bradford Young's cinematography is the aspect that really holds it together. He relishes in the darkness, pushes objects to the edge of the frame, and holds so much tension in the air. At the very least, he makes this film such expertly crafted cinema. However, I would've liked to have seen King withstand a bit more damage. He may be courageous but it's difficult to have a truly compelling protagonist without taking some punches themselves. Perhaps Selma is too broad for its own good. It may not incite a fire in me like the filmmakers have, but I certainly admire the filmmaking. Lots of bright futures in this cast and crew.<br/><br/>8/10"

One has to wonder why we are going backwards. It is all intentional. Don't fall for it people! Selma was clearly an attempt to race bate.<br/><br/>They didn't even bother trying to make Martin Luther King Jr. interesting in the movie! We learned nothing of his personal life, no humor, no depth of spirit, and there was absolutely NO chemistry between King and his wife in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also introduces important characters and never explains to the viewer who they were! And, the movie has no one in it portraying the Rev. Jesse Jackson! <br/><br/>Why is this important? It is important because Jackson was a key part in Kings life and particularly his last days, up to the fatal shot on the balcony.<br/><br/>The Rev. Jesse Jackson has said that while taking his last breath, Martin Luther King whispered to him to carry on for him and take his place.<br/><br/>There are those who have researched Kings death and there is very credible proof that the Rev. Jesse Jackson was a part of the plot to kill King! The reader is urged to look up Steve Cokely, and his very detailed video research on the murder of Martin Luther King Jr.<br/><br/>The movie also skips past the deaths of Kennedy and Malcolm X, no footage, nothing! It's as if the movie Selma was made strictly to capitalize off the racially tense times we are experiencing in the U.S. now, and to play that one line about Ferguson in the rap song as the movie credits begin to roll! <br/><br/>I mean, as soon as the movie ends, we hear the word Ferguson! What kind of blatant mind control campaign was this!<br/><br/>And all this talk about who should be nominated for Oscars for this is also campaigning. They want you to start parroting the mess so you feel like you're in with the in-crowd that thinks the movie is hot! Don't fall for it.<br/><br/>A movie about the life of Selma Blair would be more interesting than Selma! And oh yes! When the viewer gets to the scene concerning the Selma march, you will be so angry at how they direct, wrote and act it out, you will want to scream! <br/><br/>In the end, you realize, the movie Selma, had nothing to do with Selma, or King!!!!!!! <br/><br/>It really will angry you off! If you want a superior, realistic, well acted, well written movie and performance about Martin Luther King, you need to get ""King"" staring Paul Winfield. <br/><br/>And again, even in this superior version, there is NO Jesse Jackson!!!!!

","Once one gets used to the fact that the film of the original events in Selma, Alabama, is more interesting than this fictionalized piece, it starts to become a disappointment. The young man who plays Martin Luther King, Jr., does a decent job, but there is something lacking. When we hear speeches by King, there is a power to his delivery. Something is missing here. While a British actor plays King and he does great with a southern American, his delivery lacks the punch. What makes the movie worthwhile is the portrayal of the marches, all three of them. The first is so graphic in its violence as those marshals block the area on the other side of the bridge. Also missing is lively dialogue among the leaders of the movement. They are so stiff where they should be fighting among each other, expressing their fears and bringing us into the process. Lyndon Johnson is seen as the bad guy (along with, of course, George Wallace), but his portrayal is stilted. Where is that Texas accent. He is so impressed in our minds. There should be more bluster and casual dominance in this figure. While this is a decent rendering of a major event in the development of man's quest for freedom, it falls a bit flat."

I did not remember some of the key events of the film from my memory of history classes in school, and it was invigorating and inspiring to see some of the story. I thought that the timeline of the movie was perfect, as it didn't overdo how much we needed to see of MLK's life and didn't draw things out too much.<br/><br/>I loved that we were able to see some depictions of behind-the-scenes stuff. This was interesting and made the movie so much better than a bunch of (wonderful) MLK speeches. It reminded me of Lincoln in that regard. Definitely worth a watch."
"jake-law123","6","9","17","9 January 2015"," A little too in your face for me.
","I was pretty interested in seeing this, mostly because this was the main contender for Oscar bait, (before the Oscar nominations anyway). I saw it opening day with my brothers, needless to say it wasn't packed, (probably too busy seeing Transformers or something stupid). The film wasn't as much of an impact as I hoped it would be. I was hoping it would grab me in the same way 12 Years a Slave did, but it wasn't nearly as moving as I thought.<br/><br/>It tells the story of MLK Jr. (David Oyelowo), as he fights to get voting rights from Alabama's African American restrictions through his pacifist ways and reasoning, assembling a march from Selma to Montgomery.<br/><br/>The cinematography, performances, and directing style are excellent. The cinematography was smooth, stylish, and it just looked good overall with the lighting. David Oyelowo was super convincing. He not only looked the part, but he acted the crap out of the part. His wife played by Carmen Ejogo is very supportive, and was probably my second favorite performance of the film. Other than her, the rest of the supporting cast is kind of weak. Opera plays the exact same character in every single film about race, the strong willed woman who doesn't tolerate discrimination by hitting people, it's a reprise of her role in The Color Purple, which was done better. Tim Roth as George Wallace is so over the top, it's just goofy. Martin Sheen is barely in it, so I don't see the point of him in the film other than just being a cameo. I didn't appreciate their portrayal of LBJ as Tom Wilkinson. Though his performance was good, they payed no respect to the man who reasoned with MLK in real life and was the one who suggested the march in the first place. It makes me feel like the director is testing the Academy on race.<br/><br/>I didn't feel like the film spoke to me. 12 Years a Slave was my favorite film of last year, that film spoke to me and it told its story more interestingly. In here, it feels like they're just hammering in the white guilt in every scene. I know that's how it really was, but i'm sorry, its just been done to death, we don't need another one. There's preachy scenes that are well done, but it just keeps going back to constant scenes of race violence. 12 Years a Slave had that as well, but it had a stronger narrative for me, about how it's all about survival. In here, they just milk it way too much, especially with LBJ's portrayal. Again, it's not Tom Wilkinson's fault, he acts it well, it's the way he was written. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film, the performances and editing and what not, but it lacked a solid narrative, and it tried too hard to appeal to the ""don't be racist"" film lovers. I'm not against those films, but it's overdone here. Still would recommend, but just not for me."
"mazinman-1","4","5","8","5 May 2015"," Major Disappointment
","After watching the Academy Awards last Feb I greatly anticipated watching Selma but man, was I ever so disappointed. I found it trite, full of stereotypes, overacted, and misdirected.<br/><br/>As a child of the 60s, who lived in deep Georgia, I was looking for an accurate historical representation, if not a reasonable hyperbole of the time. I got neither in Selma. It was painful to watch for the first few minutes and proceeded to get worse from there.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is a fine actor but I think he was done wrong by the director, Ava DuVernay, who is clearly over her head in this film. If I'm not mistaken, this is DuVernay's first time up as director of a major motion picture (if ever) and I get the sense this is a student film. Not only is the directing amateurish but the blocking and shot selection feels forced and from a neophyte.<br/><br/>Its a shame, because I had so much hope and wanted so much more for this story of Dr. MLK, Jr. I guess we'll just have to wait for the next go around, if there is one. Hopefully next time, however, the studio will select a seasoned professional to direct."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","9","19","43","9 January 2015"," Powerful and compellingly realistic portrayal of a memorable man
","Ava DuVernay's film Selma is a powerful cinematic telling of the lesser known chronicle of Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign for equal voting rights.<br/><br/>The tale told in Selma is not the narrative of Dr. King's fight for peace and societal equality, but the peaceful dispute for voting power and autonomy.<br/><br/>Ava DuVernay directs the powerful story of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. towards the later years in his life, as written in screenplay form by Paul Webb. The man we see is an accomplished and ultimately successful advocate and recognized by the Nobel committee for his efforts in the civil rights movement. His work as a reverend and a leader is far from finished. In 1965 he is brought to Alabama to lead a dangerous campaign for equal voting rights amidst a racially vitriolic environment.<br/><br/>Duvernay and Webb's film is not an idealistic portrayal of a humanitarian and his movement but a realistic representation of a man. For over a decade King has been fighting, and the man we see is justifiably growing tired as the crusade turns increasingly complicated. David Oyelowo takes on the insurmountable task of portraying one of the most respected activists in American history and succeeds gracefully. Oyelowo encompasses the silent power and commanding oratory skills of the famous African-American Civil Rights advocate. Selma also has close to twenty compelling supporting roles, each matching Oyelowo's dynamic performance.<br/><br/>Selma is a mighty cinematic experience that seems relatively historically accurate and free from severe embellishments, though I am not a historian so I can not say for sure. The political figures are varying shades of gray in a complex political climate. Further, DuVernay does not shy from the horror in the violence, neither does she exaggerate.<br/><br/>It will be surprising if Selma does not elicit an emotional response. The story may not bring out the tears from a sobbing cry of sorrow but will evoke the catching and hurtful ache from the pain of the racial injustice of that generation. A truly effective film will make its audience relate and sympathize, and that is just what the filmmakers of Selma accomplish. As an evocative response from an artwork; that is a marvelous sentiment to achieve.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for more FULL reviews of all the recent releases and awards contenders."

The story of his journey through Selma was told so well. I was not bored for 1 minute. Everyone in this movie did an outstanding performance. I really felt like I was watching MLK. If you love history about the civil rights movement you'll love it.

This movie impacted me so much, emotionally, physically, mentally. I cant stop thinking about it. Man could that man give a speech! I recommend it to anyone but kids under 13. While it is educational, it is graphic images and deals with very serious issues. Definitely going to buy on DVD."

The acting was superb I really felt for the people and their struggle one can only imagine what they went through to achieve their goal.<br/><br/>There wasn't a lot of action but it moved very well and kept my interest.

I don't want to go into great detail since it is based on actual events there is no need to. I was disappointed in the limited release but I was lucky it was on 42 street which is walking distance from the Port Authority so it wasn't a bad commute from NJ.

"ClaytonDavis","10","20","46","24 December 2014"," Ava DuVernay's passion pours from the screen with a history making performance from David Oyelowo...
","Passionate, informative, and tenderly told, Ava DuVernay's vision of Martin Luther King Jr. and his fight for voters' rights is fully realized in her newest film ""Selma."" Written by Paul Webb, the film is ambitious, moving, and features a performance fit for the history books from David Oyelowo. It's one of the single best things you can see in 2014.<br/><br/>In a time where the state of our country is in disarray over race and politics, ""Selma"" hits our doorsteps at the right time for both sides of the coin to indulge and see how far we've come, or how little we actually have. ""Selma"" shows the good and the bad, the perfect and imperfect characteristics of one of the most important figures in the fight for civil rights. There's respect, which goes without question, but there's an emotional and raw honesty that DuVernay and Webb choose to tell us about the man who was Dr. King. She doesn't paint the rosey picture you'd come to expect from standard biopics these days. She lays it out, leaving us to decide for ourselves if something outside of what he contributed to our country is great enough to look passed. DuVernay offers in many ways, the single best direction of the year.<br/><br/>Invigorating from beginning to end, David Oyelowo owns every frame of the picture. You don't see performances like this too often especially of a real-life figure like MLK. I go back to works like Denzel Washington (""Malcolm X""), Ben Kingsley (""Gandhi""), and George C. Scott (""Patton"") to find a more jaw-dropping or complex acting performance. Something like this only seems to come around once a decade. This may be our decade's. It's more than just the embodiment, it's the decisions in the silence that makes Oyelowo so amazing. You will remember this performance forever.<br/><br/>The entire cast does an admirable to amazing job in their respective roles. Carmen Ejogo is simply electrifying as Coretta Scott King. An impeccable example of wearing the emotions and feelings at the brim without letting go. Just sensational top to bottom.<br/><br/>Despite some hiccups in the accent department, Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth are serviced well as Lyndon B. Johnson and George Wallace. Both have their opportunities to stand out in their respective scenes but ultimately stand as reminders that we are eagerly waiting to get back to Dr. King.<br/><br/>DuVernay's triumph comes from the extras and smaller name cast she utilizes as sprinkles in every instance that they appear. Stan Houston as the treacherous Sheriff Clark is superbly focused and embodies the mindset of every unfortunate person of hate during the time. Henry G. Sanders and Keith Stanfield in many ways become the heart and soul of the film without no more than just a few moments of screen time. Oprah Winfrey and Lorraine Toussaint also execute their roles proficiently.<br/><br/>The slick and vivacious manner in which ""Selma"" is assembled is thanks to the genius people behind the camera. Cinematographer Bradford Young is just too great at what he does at this point in his career. With another stunning framing form in J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year,"" he rises in the ranks to join Roger Deakins and Emmanuel Lubezki as one of the most exciting DP's. Spencer Averick's editing keeps ""Selma"" on pace, and engaging 100% of the time. Jason Moran's score is palpable and justified in every sense of its usage.<br/><br/>""Selma"" is just a joy to behold, a magnificent example of passionate filmmaking that lacked sorely in 2014. It propels DuVernay among the ranks of the best filmmakers working today. Naturally brought to tears, it's a gut-wrenching and honest look into our history. Fulfilling, promised, and profound. One of the year's best films."
"eyeintrees","5","3","4","5 July 2015"," Yes, the acting was good but...
","Yes, the acting was good, some of it truly exceptional. However... this movie felt as if someone had either lost a whole bunch of pages in the history book or they just cut and chopped and the cutting room floor is knee deep in bits and pieces that might better have been left in.<br/><br/>A story such as this can't be effectively told in two hours, not unless the movie maker is truly brilliant. And that's what's seriously flawed about it. In some places in jumped so much that even my quickest, most discerning attention was left wondering... what the heck??? Stunning performances from the actors; all of them.<br/><br/>I was not terribly interested to learn that MLK was a serial adulterer or a smoker... whatever... that's for his family to know and understand and deal with, not me. I got mixed messages from this. I think what the movie maker was trying to do was to show that even truly great men are flawed... wow... what a revelation... as if we don't already know that. So I was left less than particularly interested in this great revelation.<br/><br/>I think that the approach was ordinary, rather sloppy, wasting a lot of good performances. Like I said, it may still be on the cutting room floor, we'll never know.<br/><br/>I find MLK utterly amazing in what he achieved and I'm not religious or black. I think he showed extraordinary genius and bravery, whether he smoked, was unfortunately attracted to other women, or not.<br/><br/>An average movie made with wonderful actors that won't be memorable for me."

","Would you watch this again! Probably not. Very much to see from the historical aspect but didn't find it entertaining or engrossing and if anything a bit drab. Maybe this is why it missed out on the Oscar season as it should have been better and shouldn't get nominations because of the subject (as Oscars are about films not the subject). Given the life of Martin Luther King, maybe they should have picked a different part of his life but then again, this was a very significant story. Maybe sometimes the challenge to make a film about such a great man is overwhelming to the point that it makes the task impossible. This reminded me of Lincoln which while not as bad as the sleepfest drabness of the overrated Lincoln film, it is slow and does not grab you. The acting is fine and nothing close to pretentious like Day-Lewis, with his questionable Oscar for over acting while sending people asleep. They make the social commentary, they clearly get the point across of how reprehensible some of the characters are, how wrong all of this was, but maybe that is what happens, it's too much to make it into the product they wanted. Maybe it is a case of getting caught between making it entertaining and giving a true accurate reflection of these historic events in this great man's life in which he has to fix what Lincoln couldn't all those years ago."
"sweetyhide","6","4","6","19 February 2015"," Important Film But not Great
","This is an important film to watch because of the content, but as for the movie quality, it isn't a great film, in my opinion. Go see the movie for the significance of the time, but don't get your hopes up for a ""Best Picture"". <br/><br/>The film is not as much about Martian Luther King Jr. as it is about the Selma March, even though it clearly delves into MLK's emotional struggles during this time. The Selma March, black people fighting for their right to vote in the south, is one of the most disturbing moments in history, and this film portrays that. Director Ava Duvernay wanted to focus on ""small moments"" and I believe that is what she did. But the screenplay had serious pacing problems and many long, drawn out scenes that were unnecessary.<br/><br/>The acting, for the most part was great. David Oyelowu, as Martin Luther King Jr. was surprisingly moving. Oyelowu has always been great in his many small supporting roles but here he steps out to the front and shines.<br/><br/>Tim Roth was creepy as hell as George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama. I always applauded all his acting efforts, but can't think of any as creepy as this role. He played it well.<br/><br/>I was also surprised at how well Tom Wilkinson did portraying Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president. In my mind it doesn't seem to work but Wilkinson was flawless."

Excellent depiction of Martin Luther King Jr.'s epic take on the Civil Rights Movement and the titular firestorm march on Alabama amidst racial strife and a heel-dragging LBJ administration. Oyleowo uncannily sounds like the late leader and gives a powerful Oscar-worthy turn as does Ejogo as his long-suffering better half Corretta Scott King.

"richard-1787","10","17","39","9 January 2015"," A deeply moving picture
","Yes, the acting in this movie is all first-rate. David Oyelowo, by far the most striking presence in the movie, will probably get an Oscar nomination for his understated but therefore all the more powerful performance as MLK. (My bet is that the Oscar for Best Actor will go to one of this year's performances of a man suffering from a disease, since that is what the Academy seems to honor most.) What makes this movie so deeply moving, however, at least for me, is 1) the script, which is a masterpiece of organization and character development, and 2) Ava DuVernay's direction, which pulls together a very complex series of elements into a single narrative flow that, though it moves slowly, never once in the 128 minutes loses our attention, or even lets down the almost constant intensity. Nothing is overdone. Nothing is unnecessary. Almost everything is understated. Brief scenes have powerful effects by the placement of a camera, the timing of the dialogue (waiting for MLK to answer his wife's question about whether he loved any of the women he has had affairs with, etc.). People will praise David Oyelowo's performance, and deservedly so. But the real star of this movie is Ms. DuVerney, who makes everyone and everything else look amazing.<br/><br/>At the very end, after all the credits - for which I found some of the music to be the only let-down in the entire picture - there is a statement that this is not a documentary, but rather a feature film that takes the liberties with historical fact that feature films take. And, certainly, it would be interesting to learn where this movie deviates from those facts.<br/><br/>But in the case of this movie, it won't, in a sense, make a lot of difference. This movie makes such a profound effect, using all the tools at the disposal of a first-rate director, that it will be seen by those outside this country as ""the truth."" It may not be the most-watched American movie around the world during the next few years. But this I can guarantee you: it will, more than any other American movie of the last several years, shape how much of the rest of the world sees us for the next several years.<br/><br/>-------------------------------<br/><br/>A postscript: this morning I read a column by Maureen O'Dowd complaining about the largely negative portrayal of LBJ in this movie. She quoted presidential historians who maintain, evidently with good reason, that Johnson was more pro-active in moving toward civil rights reforms than this movie suggests. That is unfortunate for LBJ's legacy, because the power of this movie, one that is going to be watched over and over again for years to come, is certainly going to trump the work of presidential historians in the minds of the general public even here in the U.S."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Historical dramatizations can be a tricky business, as delivering both truth and entertainment value is quite challenging. There is always an expert quick to point out any artistic license taken at the expense of historical accuracy. Of course, most movie lovers have come to accept that even the best-intentioned Hollywood looks at history will be at least as focused on selling tickets as educating the public. Because of this, the swirling controversies for this film are neither surprising nor overly distracting from its message.<br/><br/>March 7, 1965 is known as Bloody Sunday and marks one of the most despicable moments in U.S. history. It was also a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement and can be viewed as shrewd strategy from Martin Luther King, Jr. and his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The movie makes it clear that MLK had a full understanding that Selma, Alabama and it's racist, redneck Sheriff Jim Clark provided the perfect opportunity for a violent reaction to King's demonstrations and protests. It also makes it very clear that there was boundless ignorance, hatred and racism on the part of many southern whites. If the subject matter is somehow not enough to grab your attention, the startling event that occurs 5 minutes in will surely leave you shaken.<br/><br/>The film does an outstanding job of focusing on two pieces of this most complex puzzle: 1. the boots on the ground ‚Äì the grass roots movement of the people, and 2. the ongoing political debates occurring between MLK and LBJ, between LBJ and his staff, and between MLK and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>The Civil Rights Act had already been passed, so the efforts were in hopes of overcoming the obstacles faced by southern blacks who wished to vote. One of the film's best scenes has activist Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) trying yet again to have her voter registration processed, but being rebuffed by a county clerk through an impossible Q&A session. These intimate moments are where the film excels: Coretta questioning MLK on his love for her, MLK speaking with grandfather of Jimmie Lee Jackson outside the morgue, and MLK turning down the proposal of US Attorney John Doar (Alessandro Nivola).<br/><br/>In an odd twist of casting, four of the leading characters are played by Brits: David Oyelowo as MLK, Tom Wilkinson as LBJ, Tim Roth as George Wallace and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. All four are excellent, but it's Mr. Roth as the racist-beyond-belief Alabama Governor Wallace that is the most slitheringly evil, while Mr. Oyelowo gives what can only be described as a towering performance of the man many of us know only from history books and news reels (and a January holiday).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is vast and talented, and because the story spends so much time on the individuals, many of these spend little time on screen. In addition to Andrew Young (Andre Holland), Reverend Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce), J Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Lee C White (Giovanni Ribisi), we also see activist Diana Nash (Tessa Thompson), CT Vivian (Corey Reynolds), John Lewis (Stephen James), and Judge Johnson (Martin Sheen). The most bizarre moment has Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) in a quasi-Mr Rogers depiction as he discussed his new found approach with Coretta.<br/><br/>The original King speeches are owned by another studio so those delivered here by Oyelowo have been re-written and revised, yet the words and Oyelowo's powerful oratory deliver the message loud and clear. While it can be argued that the film delivers only one point of view (the FBI was no friend to the movement), it can just as easily be argued that previous films have done the same thing ‚Äì only from the ""other"" perspective (Mississippi Burning, Ghosts of Mississippi).<br/><br/>In what can be viewed as the first serious movie on Martin Luther King, director Ava DuVernay announces her presence with authority. She will have no need to return to her career as a movie publicist, and we will be watching to see what type of projects appeal to her after this. In a brilliant move, the story focuses on a period of just a few months in 1965, rather than tackling the MLK legacy. She presents him as a man with strengths, flaws, doubts, and determination. It's clear why so many followed him, and it's all the more painful to know that so many resisted."
"Robert_duder","6","6","11","11 January 2015"," Another Bio-Pic that misunderstands its purpose
","I saw exactly one trailer for this before Birdman and right away I thought that this would be one critics would love or it would be another case of The Butler where audiences loved it but critics mostly ignored it. It seems to be falling somewhere in the middle. In some ways I was disappointed with the film but it resonated with me because it was so familiar to other bio-pics I've seen recently like J. Edgar or Invictus or Mandela (and no I'm not picking on Clint Eastwood or Nelson Mandela) Consider this, we have yet to have an epic bio-pic about the entire life of Martin Luther King Jr. We have never seen an incredible actor stand up and perform the ""I Have A Dream"" Speech or watch in horror as his brutal assassination is recreated. We have never had any of that. So when you go into a film that focuses on one tiny aspect of a man who is larger than life, you walk away feeling more than a little cheated. What happened in Selma was very important...don't misunderstand me...but I wanted more. I wanted to see more Dr. King, I wanted to see more of the story and what he did and I felt like this spent too much time focusing on that one event and you don't get anything else around it. They do try to establish the tumultuous world and do so very effectively but there are very few of us who haven't seen this done before in films.<br/><br/>The cast was good but fell short of being great in my opinion. David Oyelowo was very good as Dr. King. What an incredible role for him to take on and he certainly looks the part, sounds the part and delivers his one particular speech very very well. It actually gave me goosebumps to think about what Oyelowo could have done with the role had they given him more to work with. Same could be said for Carmen Ejogo who plays his wife. Their dynamic and side story actually was one of the most interesting in the film and they could have revolved an entire film around their marriage, that would have been more fascinating. Despite reviewers saying otherwise I thought Tom Wilkinson did an excellent job playing President Lyndon Johnson. He isn't given as much as he could have either but what he does is very good. There were some interesting conversations between him and various other political figures that I think were perhaps meant to imply various historical actions (a fascinating conversation between LBJ and J Edgar played by Dylan Baker held implications about the Kennedy Assassination I believe and perhaps Dr. King's assassination too.) Oprah Winfrey has a small role mostly in the beginning of the film but she proves again that she still has some acting chops. Everyone else in the cast is good in various small but integral supporting roles. No one really stands out from the main cast as important as their characters are.<br/><br/>Before even looking at the director for the film, I thought to myself I guarantee they are someone with out a lot of experience. Ava DuVernay has done a little of this and a little of that but doesn't have a ton of experience yet behind her. I think it showed in this film. She probably had a lot of great ideas and tried to pack everything in there but I feel like she is missing what could have been provided about this story. Any film with Martin Luther King at the forefront should be moving and have a profound impact and Selma failed to do that for me. It was decently told and I understand everything and there were some good scenes but nothing we haven't seen before and it just gave us information and didn't move us or make us feel like we were there. I watched this back to back with another historical based on a true story film called Unbroken and both movies gave us plenty of information but failed to put us in the shoes of the people there and that's what a great bio-pic and period piece should do. Much like The Butler last year, I felt like this didn't give what it could have so its a miss in my books. 6.5/10"

","Selma (directed by Ava DuVernay and written by Paul Webb) features Martin Luther King Jr. (played by David Oyelowo) leading a civil rights march in Selma because he is tired of African Americans being denied the right to vote. On top of this, he and his wife Coretta Scott King (played by Carmen Ejogo) are having marriage issues. All of these things combined results in an intense, emotional, and masterful film that stands as one of the most important biopics of the year and arguably ever made.<br/><br/>Must I talk about David Oyelowo's portrayal of Dr. King? For an actor who I'd never heard of until seeing him play a principal for 5 seconds in Interstellar, and for the guy who played the unmemorable Doctor in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, he gives the best performance of the year. David is not playing Dr. King, he IS Doctor King. He talks like him, acts like him, looks like him, sounds like him, has his haircut like him, etc. I felt like I was legitimately watching Dr. King on screen. Some of the scenes that are extremely emotionally intense, I'd always pay attention to David's expressions, and in every one of them he'd be at the top of his craft. Unfortunately, David's performance is so spectacular that moments he isn't on screen results in the film slowing down. In fact, I feel that if the performance of Dr. King wasn't as compelling as it was, I'd be giving this film a 7 or an 8. Without David carrying the film, it would simply be an above average civil rights movie, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Lets forget about the acting and story for a second and appreciate the technical aspects of this film. Ava DuVernay is not a director I'm familiar with, in fact I've seen none of her movies. But seeing this one, I feel compelled to check them out. This movie is wonderfully shot and directed. Some cinematography is absolutely stunning and the film does a great job at depicting the time period. When moments are intense, the camera is intense. When it's time for a rousing speech by the Doctor, the camera is rousing. It's perfectly directed for the most part, besides a few scenes where a character is killed or beaten and the camera goes slow-mo for a straight minute holding onto the slow motion shot. I get its meant to give the audience time to grieve and be shocked, but it would've been more effective if the scene went by quickly. Also, the soundtrack of the film ranges from inspirational to downright intense, and scenes with the soundtrack playing are just as emotional as scenes without it playing.<br/><br/>The writing in this film, especially the dialog between Dr. King and his wife, and Dr. King in some of his civil rights buddies, is excellent. I think the best however is the speeches and monologues given by Doctor King. With the writing being delivered passionately by David, some scenes had me completely engaged with chills up my spine. It's extraordinary.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of reviews of this film critiquing the fact that it is not entirely ""historically accurate."" However, I must ask the same reviewers if they like Braveheart, and if the answer is yes, why don't they critique that film fore being historically inaccurate? Yes, the film may be inaccurate, but people have to realize that historical pics are only trying to convey the message of what was going on in the time period, they're not trying to recreate word for word what actually happened in that time period. Plus, some thematic elements need to be added. If I wanted to learn about the Civil Rights march in a short amount of time by watching something, I'd watch the history channel. This is meant to be a film depicting the rampant racism and violence that the African American people had to deal with, not a PBS special on Dr. King.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that I will be picking up on bluray. Featuring a masterful performance from David Oyelowo, and a strong supporting cast, in addition to the brilliant writing and direction, this is a must see biopic. However, I can't say it'd be amazing without the inclusion of David (and it shows with scenes that don't include him, which slows the film down as a result), which is why I have to give this film a 9. Go see it."

","Every year there is at least one (African Americanized) motion picture that steals the Oscar. Most are fantastic, but certainly not Oscar worthy. Even Selma was a noble movie with strong performances, is it going to be nominated for best picture? probably. Does it deserve it? No not really. Don't get me wrong I actually really enjoy sensitive movies with racism as one of the topics. But sometimes the Academy Awards have to move out of their comfort zones.<br/><br/>But setting all that aside, as a film Selma was executed very nicely and portrays the chronicle of Martin Luther king Jr quite well. Historically inaccurate at times but it still flowed thanks to its beautiful cinematography and precise direction. At first I was shaking my head to the dreadful miscast but somehow they were quite memorable. Especially on David Oyelowo's behalf, who delivered a stunning performance and an admirable portrayal on Martin Luther King Jr. The film was luminously written and the script holds brilliance. The only thing bringing it down was its excruciatingly slow pacing. The story was brilliant but the film was unnecessarily slow. Almost tedious at times during the first and second act but thankfully manages to balance things out with some incredible stand out scenes and the final speech. Not all the characters were developed to their full potential which made some seem weak and impossible to be emotionally attached to as an audience. Overall Selma was a stand out biography but defiantly not an Oscar contender for sure."

","Selma one more time reminds us how black people gained their rights in USA. We watch an important part of Martin Luther King's war which he dedicated his life. There are lots of production about racism in USA which is one of their biggest dishonors with atomic bombs. Yet, Selma is different from processors with telling not the life story of Martin Luther King but a short period of his campaign which has big impacts for the whole movement. King is already a well-known and appreciated person in world history. For people who didn't study American history in rest of the world, movie gives us a chance to know about Selma ‚Äì Montgomery march which is a big milestone in Martin Luther King's civil disobedience.<br/><br/>After opening with a shocking scene, movie keeps same harsh texture as same as historical conditions bring to the real world it tells. Actually it takes a general look to social struggles of American people with using a short period of time and with a specific right that blacks try to gain. Fire of tension is kept alive along the whole movie. Most shining part of movie is David Oyelowo who is not just playing but living Martin Luther King. Such a convincing performance shows how much he interiorized his role. Other salient point is the brave language at telling the ideas and beliefs of politicians at their time. From president Lyndon B. Johnson to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, from Kennedy to Alabama governor George Wallace many powerful figures find place in movie with their crystal cold renditions. Mentioning Malcolm X himself and responses of his acts in White House, also showing the tracing records and conspiracies about Martin Luther King are very brave choices with such clear language. I t is obviously a hard movie like a stone which is thrown to the head of narrow-minded societies.<br/><br/>As a costume drama, I can say that we have a successful result of devoted hard work. Scene settings, costumes and make up help us to feel the essence of time. If a movie pushes you to research what it tells after you leave theater I consider it as an influential one.<br/><br/>The movie gives us a good opportunity to watch a man who has all responsibility of one race in entire continent only at his thirties."
"rblenheim","8","5","9","27 February 2015"," A momentous story made into a nearly perfect film
","""Selma"" is 90% of a great film. It tells the true story of a three month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King, Jr. led his famous march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to secure equal voting rights against violent opposition. The period is skillfully recreated, generally knowing exactly what to center the drama on, wisely much more than on King himself but on the entire community and how so many came together to alter history.<br/><br/>In spite of the film's impact (especially in the violent scenes between the police and the protesters) and some great performances, the script by Paul Webb inserts a fictitious clash between King and President Lyndon Johnson in order to add a conflict to the film. This has drawn much criticism but, more than doing a disservice to LBJ (who reportedly did not impede putting forward the voting rights bill), it also reveals that Webb and director DuVernay did not feel there was enough dramatic conflict inherent in the story without it. One can legitimately argue either way, but in my opinion it would have been better to further emphasize the interaction of all the participants more without 'hyping' the LBJ conflict. Even if the film had been less 'dramatic' in a classical sense it would have been more accurate as well as effective. Still, this film is a must-see and a significant document of a crucial time in the history of America."
"vistheindian","8","5","9","22 February 2015"," The nightmare before the dream
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Selma chronicles a crucial moment in Martin Luther King's campaign for equal voting rights. In a time when civil rights movement was gaining momentum, M.L.K. still had many obstacles to overcome, both personally and politically. Despite the opposition that resulted in innocent casualties, King leads the march from Selma to Montgomery that would go on to become a significant victory for civil rights. David Oyelowo excellent portrayal of M.L.K. brings us the relatable human behind the icon and leader for peace. Selma is a deeply engaging biopic showing both behind the scenes of the movement and the burden of responsibility that M.L.K carried as a leader. This is a film that does great justice in depicting a vital moment in American history.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Who hasn't heard of Martin Luther King? Everyone has heard of him. He led the ambitious peaceful protests to give every American citizen the right to vote, regardless of their skin color. However, I wouldn't be surprised if many of you didn't know much about the man himself. I certainly don't and that's why I had to see this movie.<br/><br/>In history class we have all learned about the revolutionary leaders such as Gandhi, Mandela, and M.L.K. We know of all the freedom fighting movements they led in their countries and the seemingly unsurmountable obstacles they had to face. So we easily start seeing them as being more than human without any weakness or breaking point. The greatest strength of this movie is David Oyelowo because he showed us the vulnerability of M.L.K. Just in his silence he communicates the overwhelming doubts he had about his involvement. It wasn't only his life at risk, but also the lives of his family and his supporters. I liked seeing this side of him because it helped to understand his motivation to continue his campaign. Oyelowo portrays M.L.K. as a relatable human being with very real fears, but also his almost superhuman nature in the way he picks himself up and faces the threats head on.<br/><br/>The approach to biopic is rather unorthodox for Selma, when compared to others out there. It doesn't tell the whole life story of M.L.K. from birth to death. Instead it concentrates on a 2-3 month period during the civil rights movement. By concentrating on this singular event of the Selma march it refines the storytelling and provides us with a concise, well-paced flow to the movie. I should also mention the depiction of the racial violence in this film. It was definitely graphic, at times difficult to watch. Even when considering setting of the time I was left speechless. So if you are sensitive to that you've been warned. Still it was the extreme reality that thousands of people had to face every day. Hence I appreciate that the director did not hold back on showing the horrible atrocities at its most violent.<br/><br/>Filming wise, Selma is well directed and brilliantly acted. However, bearing in mind the historical significance of the events covered, this movie needed to be more than well-filmed, and it absolutely is. This is an important film to watch to understand the man behind the movement, and by choosing to showcase the culmination of King's work, the Selma march, there is not a single wasted moment.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","I don't think I ever seen a movie that created such a real portrayal of Martian Luther King. He was a great man indeed, but let's not forget he was just a man, and that's the greatest thing about him. <br/><br/>British actor David Oyelowo nailed it, Just nailed it! it was amazing to watch him work. <br/><br/>Most movies I've seen about Martian Luther King (with the exception of the movie Boycott) attempt to go over his entire lifetime, but like Boycott, the movie focuses on the struggle of one of his many accomplishments,the fight for suffrage. It was this focus on the one topic that we got to see more of the man. Showing people that it was not an easy task just shows us all what we can do.<br/><br/>In this time and age it was hard watching some of the images going on in this movie. Some things have changed so much and it's painful to see how people use to be treated. While some things have not changed, which saddens me greatly.<br/><br/>I only wished this movie came out a few weeks earlier. The world needs to be shown again how battling equality should be done."

","My husband and I saw this well-done film at a screening this evening. I found it totally absorbing as well as extremely painful to watch, but realize what I felt was nothing compared to the racist brutality inflicted on the peaceful marchers in this portrayal. David O gives a riveting performance as MLK Jr., so that to me is one of the most important reasons to watch the film. It's also an honest depiction of our history that should be seen by people of all races. Although the pacing is sometimes slow and a bit wooden in places, this could be the perfect technique to use as counterpoint to the portrayal of the explosive violence and viciousness that the peaceful protesters must endure. We found most of the acting to be excellent, such as the actors who played Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Andrew Young, and President Johnson, but a few of the actors cast did not seem correct at all: Tim Roth was excellent playing an evil racist, but he did not seem to me to be Wallace as I remember him. And the actor who played J Edgar Hoover was laughable in that role."
"namashi_1","6","7","15","13 January 2015"," Honest, but ordinarily treated!
","Ava DuVernay's 'Selma' is an honest film, about a significant chapter in American History, but the tone as well as the execution is so ordinarily done, that it doesn't throw you in the power you might expect. It has its share of pluses, but overall, it has a very thin vibe, which adds up as a minus.<br/><br/>'Selma' Synopsis: A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.<br/><br/>Late/Great Dr.King's journey to secure equal voting rights, was nothing short of astonishing. He emerged victorious & made a breakthrough for all his people. And 'Selma', without a shed of doubt, is a earnest attempt to re-tell his story.<br/><br/>But, as I mentioned before, the treatment is plain ordinary. Be it sequences of those violent epic marches or moments of Dr.King's personal life, they all look as if they were shot with less enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Paul Webb's Screenplay is good, but not gut-wrenching. Ava DuVernay's Direction is impressive, but only in parts. Cinematography & Editing are sharp. Score by Jason Moran is passable.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: David Oyelowo as Dr.King, delivers a committed performance. He embodies the American legend & enacts the part with gusto. He's the best thing about 'Selma', hands down! Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson, is over-the-top. Tim Roth as George Wallace, is limited to a few scenes. Common as James Beve, is fair. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, is very good. Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, is wasted. Martin Sheen as Frank Minis Johnson & Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Fred Gray, leave a mark.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Selma' isn't bad, but it isn't great either. One expected much more!"

","Dr. King is the main character, but '65 Selma is the subject of ""Selma"". It's an homage to his muses: the common citizens denied justice, a voice, a vote. It is about ""the movement"" in that time and at that place. <br/><br/>Those in and out of the SCLC who marched in Selma at great peril also stand for those without a voice and have prominent roles.<br/><br/>Director, Ava Duvernay, wouldn't get rights to King's speeches. So she wrote King's speech lines for the movie. So there is some lack of icon but the personal perspective is where the movie shines. <br/><br/>History is names, dates, places.... It's also unique in the heart of the student or movie goer. There are brief flashes of news archives of Bloody Sunday and the later events. Duvernay delivers some jolting recreations that touch the heart. <br/><br/>Martin Sheen appears as a federal district judge. In ""Ghandi"", he appeared as the journalist, Walker, who documented the leader's protests, giving an effective narrative and touchstone into the history. This movie includes such a role."

","OK for starters I came into this with low expectations and they were met. The importance of what Martin Luther King Jr. did just does not necessarily make for riveting historical fiction. It can and ""Mississippi Burning"" is a great example of that. Gene Hackman is the bomb in that film. This thing is boring like a metal pail, and definitely not ""Mississippi Burning."". The first time one takes a trip it's wonderous. But here we all know where this train is going, and that's exactly where it does go. Spoiler alert: when the church explodes at the beginning that took me out of my chair. After that it's all downhill sorry to say folks. Banal acting and a lackluster script do not exactly make for riveting entertainment. Throw in lousy rap as a score and you get dog vomit. It redeems itself only slightly at the end as the lead does a decent MLK impersonation. Big whoop. I feel jipped at one dollar fifty cents. Yawn."
"jadepietro","10","11","28","9 January 2015"," The Fifty Four Mile Journey
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Selma is a great film. It centers on that fateful symbolic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, back in 1965, and tells the back-story of its coming to be. We follow Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's dream of equal rights for all, amid the sacrifices, bloodshed, and death to many of those heroic protesters. <br/><br/>Selma is a history lesson, but one told with clarity and compassion. (There have been some complains about historical accuracy, objections to President Johnson's hesitant involvement in bringing about the Voting Act of 1965 to end racism. This argument seem to be invalid as the film shows both Johnson and King being politicians foremost, both leaders a product of their times, caught in the quagmire of hatred and conformity. The film never pretends to be a documentary; it is a docudrama, a powerful one, with archival footage and factual documentation that uphold the times accurately.)<br/><br/>Ava DuVernay directs the film with an assured hand and an artistic vision that keeps the film riveting and emotionally grounded. There are some moments where the film gets caught up in the sanctimonious speeches and too much moralizing, but the poetic words in Paul Webb's literate screenplay make the film epic in scope and the director's visual images send home King's compelling message. DuVernay builds tension very efficiently, particularly in the clash between protesters and police. There are scenes of sudden violence that are never gratuitous (a bombing of a church, beating of innocent demonstrators, etc.) and are handled with poignancy and humanity. <br/><br/>Making the film resonant is the central performance by British actor David Oyelowo as the pastor King. He downplays the role beautifully, showing King as a flawed but passionate person, a common man thrust into the spotlight as a national crusader for civil rights. Oyellowo captures King's spirited line delivery as a persuasive orator and has many fine subtle moments as a caring husband. Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King give ample support, showing her characters loyalty and inner strength. Their moments together bring about the personal story of this married couples' dependence on each other. The film is so well cast in most of the supporting roles, with special mentions going to Corey Reynolds, Stephan James, Tim Roth, Alessandro Nivola, and especially Tom Wilkinson as a foul-mouthed and savvy L.B.J.<br/><br/>Selma takes its audience on the long harrowing journey for equality with such reverence and restraint. There are a few minor missteps along the way as the film does lose some of its its footing in reality when it uses famous actors like Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen and Dylan Baker, all impersonating real life figures, rather than using lesser known thespians for those roles, or when the film tries to connect the non-violent actions of Dr. King and his followers with the recent protests that led to escalating violence (as in the closing scenes with the song, Glory, mentions of the recent Ferguson unrest.) That said, Selma is a glorious undertaking that documents a historic time when a nation finally looked at the horror perpetrated on a minority and finally found its soul.

"tyler-607","9","9","22","10 January 2015"," Selma: The legacy of MLK in a well-crafted, emotional drama
","""What happens when a man stands up and says enough is enough?"" <br/><br/>These harrowing words of bravery in times of adversity truly define what Selma, the unforgettable tale of one of America's greatest leaders, is setting in front of its audiences. With immense power and fearlessness, this film breaks the barriers of what can be said and done on the silver screen, as it unfolds a tale of tragedy and triumph through the eyes of the man who witnessed it first hand. Telling the story of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., Selma does not stop at the simple tossing around of famous names and tragic events with a slight of hand, but digs deeper than most historical films in its quest to lay out the pungent and beautiful life of a man conflicted at every turn. <br/><br/>Among the great and powerful films of African-American struggles, depicting events from slavery to civil rights, stands Selma, confident in its stride towards giving the people of today a look inside what men and women faced during that time. As films like Lee Daniels' The Butler, Lincoln, and 12 Years A Slave take these conflicts and shed light on their indecent horrors, Selma yearns to do the same, as it focuses on not only the man at the front lines, but also the frightened yet inspired citizens who fight, with or without violence, towards their life goals. A fan of films of this nature, depicting the true lives of men and women who tackle their conflicts in the very real world, Selma was a harrowing delight to my eyes. Spilling out immense emotion and power at every turn, from King's many preaches to the shocking acts of violence thrown into the streets of Selma, this film is among the many films I will never forget. <br/><br/>Accompanied by a fluent and emotional plot of one man's determination to make things as they should be for everyone, the performances in the film are some of the best I've seen all year. With David Oyelowo leading the pack of striking actors who deliver some of their best works here, Selma packs together a cast of unlikely proportions, but never fails to leave a character out in the sun. Starting with our leading man, Mr. Oyelowo, whom I've only seen in supporting roles in films like Jack Reacher and Rise of the Planet of the Apes, he shows us that he can obviously take the lead as he knocks Martin Luther King Jr. out of the park (figuratively, of course). Equipped with King's subtle facial features, as well as the activist's signature way with words, Oyelowo takes no prisoners with this amazing performance. With every word he spoke, from the famous speeches to the innocent conversations with Carmen Ejogo, who plays King's wife, Oyelowo suspends time and takes our attention with force to focus solely on him. With such an jolting performance as one of America's most influential people, Oyelowo is sure to be among the great men of film recognized this year as award season continues to ignite around us. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is phenomenal as they play some of the top men and women who followed King in his daring quest. From Oprah Winfrey's Annie Lee Cooper to Tom Wilkinson's President Johnson, the cast does an amazing job portraying these influential people, not leaving a single character out of place. Whether it be a conflicted civilian or a political figure like Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), who appears only for five minutes, Selma succeeds not only in dropping big names of the era, but developing a complex story that intertwines each character with one another. Other powerful performances (some not on King's side) include Tim Roth's striking role as Governor Wallace, with his Southern drawl and all, as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as Attorney Fred Gray, who appears for only a short while, but still gives a great performance. <br/><br/>With a film full of seemingly dreary politics and long speeches, you would think there is little excitement in order to hold you over for two hours. However, I will tell you different. There is nothing more exciting and gripping than this tale, a tale of terrorism and heroism, adversity and bravery, deception and redemption. Selma may have politics and speeches, but they are not speeches forced onto you as a history lesson, they are more like lessons placed in front of you for you to ponder over, thinking of how they affect our daily lives. The words of such a legend as Martin Luther King Jr. are not to be forgotten, but treasured, as this film glorifies the role this man served in the lives of millions of people, black and white alike. Selma takes pride as it mixes the rush of protest with the voices of truth in a beautifully complex vision of how corrupt yet monumental this time really was. <br/><br/>Overall, this was by far one of the best biopics I've seen in a while, packed full of emotion and wisdom. Centered on such an amazing figure in such a dark time, Selma tackles King's legacy perfectly, as well as letting us peek into the lives of some of the great people he touched with his words. With only minor flaws, like some jumbled dialogue here and there, this film is another near perfect biopic that I hope to see at the head of some of the biggest awards in film.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 9 out of 10 for its unforgettable lead actor David Oyelowo (who I hope to see on the stage with an Oscar in his hands soon enough), its great supporting cast that delivers dynamic performances all around, and its moving story of one of the most influential eras in American history.<br/><br/>Check out my blog for more reviews: silverscreensynopsis.blogspot.com"

","Truthful, Strong, and Powerful. Those are the three words I would use to describe this movie. Selma is the true story of Martin Luther King Jr., fellow African Americans, and even some White Americans as they fought to secure equal voting rights for all Americans. The performance given by David Oyelowo as MLK is reason enough to watch this movie. He was powerful and inspiring, just as MLK was and delivered his lines with strength and emotion. The screenplay by Paul Webb was amazingly written and ingeniously structured. He wrote without limits to reveal the actual pain and violence of the time. At some points, it was hard to watch, but that is the truth. That's what happened and there is no denying the truth behind this fascinating and inspiring story. Selma is truly a piece of history. I give it 8/10 stars and wish it good luck in the upcoming awards season."

","""Selma"" deals with key events in 1964 and 1965. It shows how difficult it was for Johnson to maneuver politics and eventually pass legislation to protect the civil rights of all the citizens in this country. Of course, nothing would have happened without the drive and dedication of Martin Luther King. He inspired and convinced many to see what was happening in the South becoming a political and spiritual leader to many, advocating patience, resilience, and non-violent approaches.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not easy to change society overnight, and there were many obstacles along the way, many of them a very dangerous and hateful nature. People were hit, tortured psychologically, rights were dismissed under the most ridiculous and evil circumstances, and innocent lives were destroyed along the way.<br/><br/>It is almost unbelievable to see how this happened only 50 years ago, watching how men justified their actions under the most illogical reasoning. It is heartbreaking and infuriating to see how voting rights are denied, a dying culture continues, with the support of ignorance and violence. The best scenes in ""Selma"" is when we are witnesses to the beating of people asking for their rights, and we wonder who is worse, the executors of the beating or those who just stand there fueling the fire, or tacitly approving.<br/><br/>One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is listening to politicians being afraid of change, of alienating those in power. There are comparisons to looking at the talk of helping other countries but ignoring our own needs. Unfortunately, something happens here, and the words don't quite match the powerful images.<br/><br/>At times ""Selma"" feels like an amazing achievement showing the epic moments. There is also plenty of power in the portrayal of the African American leader, but something else fails to make a connection. Still, the film is a pretty powerful reminder of the forces and events that have shaped this country."

","1965. After the end of segregation Dr. Martin Luther King receives Nobel Prize amidst the still heated south of the USA, with the then recent church bombing that claimed five little girls' lives. D. king meets with President Lyndon Johnson, demanding him to act on black people's right to vote. When Johnson evades, Dr. King goes to Selma Alabama where blacks are of more than fifty percent of population but are still restricted from voting. The white supremacists are embodied in the Sheriff Jim Clark. Dr. King says the movement needs drama to attract Johnson's attention. First they stand in front of the county registration, which ends in arrests. While Dr. King is in prison, his wife meets with Malcolm X, the leader of the other polar of the black movement. X tells her that he's views of Dr. King has changed and he's willing to help, although in a harsh way.<br/><br/>When Dr. King gets out of jail and is out Selma, an unofficial gathering happens at night that ends in violence as troopers disperse the crowds. A boy Jimmy Lee Jackson is killed in that incident. Soon the group decides to have a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The march ends in total violence where the participants are bludgeoned and beaten and all the imagery are captured on TV and news papers. Dr. King didn't walk with them as it's expected to end in violence as Johnson's aide told them. He calls out to all kinds of people to join the next march. Many people come to join, even whites, most of them clergy. But when the march actually goes, despite Johnson's attempt to make a deal with Dr. King, The troopers withdraw from their guard. But Dr. King backs down from his march. But that night a clergy member who participated on the march gets beaten and killed. And the court grants the legality for the march. At last President Johnson sends the Congress a bill to end the voting restrictions.<br/><br/>The story nicely depicts one of the milestones that Dr. Martin Luther King accomplished in his years of the civil rights movement. It encompasses enough proportions of the other sides of Dr. King's life, especially the family and politics side. There is fair depiction of Dr. King's character and life to view him as a human being rather than just a movie character.<br/><br/>We can see his devotion to the cause. We can see his patience to others' reactions. But we also get to see the human side of him, while at the same time he sees his moves as a strategist who dissects all the important details in order to come up with a strong plan. I personally think that Dr. King was kind of inspired by what Gandhi did with his march to the sea. And both of them proves that non violence is the way to do a resistance.<br/><br/>The technical aspects also help the movie to view quite beautifully. The constant sepia like color tone helps in adding the sense of authenticity to the movie. All those clever lighting play also looks nice. The occasional angle play, particularly at the speeches and sermons, also adds very nicely on how the set influences the scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is decently nice in overall. David Oyelowo has gone a long way since his days as supporting roles and now proves himself that he can handle the main focus character. Carmen Ejogo acted just a standard work in providing the completing angle of the family. Tom Wilkinson did his usual character as someone in power. Tim Roth did quite well in giving the expressions needed as Governor Wallace, although I think his accent needs to be sharpened a little bit. Giovanni Ribisi adds a nice color to the whole movie.<br/><br/>My view for Selma (2014) is that it deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see in the movies is quite a yes for me. It's an entertainment that can also inspires while at the same time reminds about the struggle that had to be done to achieve what we have now."

The Soul of MLK is Missing and the Great Civil Rights Leader is shown to be an Inanimate Introspect.<br/><br/>Overall, the Movie is only sporadically Effective invoking the Struggle and the Film comes off as an Irrelevant Redundancy when put Next to the Verbiage and Documentaries on the Subject. <br/><br/>It Seems Hesitant, Reluctant, and often times Pouty about its Concerns and Historical Significance. Overrated, Undercooked, and in the End, a Big Disappointment."

","Selma is about as powerful a movie as you're ever going to get about the extraordinary life of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. . In a time in which racial discrimination is still an important issue, this chronicle of events regarding King's fight for voting equalities in Alabama, presents us with a vision of how the tension between the two sides was even more intense during a period of controversy and change. The movie's goals are to give you this retelling of the struggle and hopefully connect with the audience, while also honoring the heroes behind the progress that was achieved.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around MLK's attempts to grant his fellow people the right to be registered voters in their town of Selma. It isn't without resistance that this movement will be met, and from then on the movie lays out the advancements and regressions that ultimately led to the achievement of the objective that was set. As our protagonist we have British actor David Oyelowo who proves he is more than capable of portraying this iconic figure. When it comes down to it, the character is without a doubt brilliantly interpreted by Oyelowo and throughout the film, one feels that the end result of the performance is a signature portrayal by the actor who owns the character from the moment the camera is on, and in return the character lives through the actor. All in all a mixture of characteristics that combine to give an extraordinary rendition of an extraordinary human being.<br/><br/>The movie comes together quite nicely and aspects such as the direction from Ava DuVernay and the competent script are all adequate for each other, offering a rich cinematic experience. I really hope Selma has a healthy staying power among liberating movies such as Glory, 12 Years A Slave, etc. It truly is deserving.<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5/10"

","Let me deal first with what for me was a major distraction; the accents of the actors playing LBJ and George Wallace. There were just not convincing and kept slipping in and out of a mild southern drawl to a mid Atlantic anonymity and back again. Their performances were okay - but not wholly convincing and compromised by the accent issue.<br/><br/>The film itself deals with Martin Luther King Jr and the 1965 peaceful protest movement to enable legally enfranchised citizens to exercise that franchise - the issue being that black Americans in many states were denied registering to vote by a variety devious means.<br/><br/>The story moves along well - we see the tensions in and caused by Luther King's approach and it does raise some legitimate questions, for example can a peaceful protest ever be simply that if it evokes a violent response? It also makes the point that a free press is important, with nationwide broadcast of official violence promoting a positive response form across to the country.<br/><br/>Of course any film about Martin Luther King Jr has a hopeless job of competing with the live footage readily available of the man himself but this film makes a good fist of it."

","There's been a lot of discussion over whether or not director Ava DuVernay should have been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards. Personally I would have to take the seemingly unpopular opinion that she was the one thing holding this film back. Admittedly the end of the film was very well done and even quite moving, but up until that point the whole thing just felt so clunky and unnatural. I see that she is quite inexperienced in the director's chair, and I feel that there was potential there, so hopefully she can iron out the odd flaw in her technique and become a really good director in the future.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is the other one stirring up some debate over his lack of a nomination. I do feel he was quite hard done by, giving a quite terrific performance. The voice and accent he used were absolutely perfect and a pleasure to listen to throughout. The rest of the cast was also excellent. I was very interested to see how Oprah Winfrey went in her role and I'd have to say she held her own very well.<br/><br/>The movie itself is good, but never enters in the realms of being great. As previously mentioned the ending is perfectly executed and will leave a good taste in a lot of people's mouths and even help them to forget some of the earlier indiscretions the film commits. Sometimes historically accurate films get bogged down by needing to be 100% in line with what actually happened. This is simply an unfortunate part of the genre which can't be avoided. Does it deserve its nomination for Best Picture at the Academy Awards? Just."

","Selma is basically a good movie when it stays on track, it only deteriotes when its falls into revisionist history. The portrayal of LBJ during this period in the movie is erroneous. That is NOT my opinion, just listen the LBJ White House tapes and to the people who were there when this tragic event happen. This second point may seem trivial to some, but to me it is a huge error. There was no live TV coverage of the Selma march. The REAL coverage was shot by some very brave NBC cameraman on 16mm film. That film was sent to New York, and aired on NBS News the following.

","""Selma"" tells the story of the Voting Rights Marchs from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama of 1965, led by among others, Famed Civil Rights Activist, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., played by David Oyelow. Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended Segregation and gave African- Americans the rights to vote, those right were being restricted, particularly in the state of Alabama. King, and other Civil Rights Activists were invited by the local civil and civic leadership to protest to repression. While King is the central figure, and the movie does some spend time on him and his wife Coretta Scott King's, played by Carmen Ejogo, relationship, and it's how it's effected by King's activism, the movie is not all a mini-biography o the late Dr. King's life at that point, and gives time to a number of the other prominent figures having do with the marches. As reported, the movie does indeed humanize King, perhaps as a metaphor that just as the way our country was flawed back then, Dr. King had his flaws as well. In the end, King is seen as the man who through sacrifices he and others made, endure to achieve the goal of the just cause of equal rights. I loved it ‚Äì It was well shot, and well acted ‚Äì you simply moved with it. Much credit to Director Ava DuVernay, and the production team, including the one and only Oprah Winfrey, who plays Civil Rights Activist Annie Lee Cooper in the film as well. Oyelowo, while performing Dr. King's speeches in the movie, doesn't try to do a perfect impression of the late Dr. King's voice (though that would have been fine if it had been the case), but does try to capture the physical movements, and powerful vocal style, and all around gives a very effective performance.

"Quinoa1984","10","5","12","19 January 2015"," the work that goes into a revolution
","Selma, about the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and how Martin Luther King and his group faced adversity at every turn to get equal voting rights, is one of the better films this year (that is to say, it's just shy of my top 10 list, but it's still really really really good).<br/><br/>Oyelowo and director DuVernay turned in fantastic work. I can see why you'd say the filmmaking does matter here. What I loved about the movie were actually the little moments, quiet scenes where King is trying to figure out what he'll write or talking in hushed tones in a prison cell, or (what I didn't expect) the scene where the extramarital question is raised and done in brilliant drama between King and his wife - that is particularly a wonderful scene with so much weight in this room that is surrounded by the threat of death, but it still all comes down to love.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? May be not, but it really is directed and presented with vitality and especially now it's more (sadly) relevant than ever between the cop murders and voter disenfranchisement in the south. When you're watching scenes that are really set pieces for the major events that unfold with people being beaten and killed ruthlessly, it's hard to watch - which is the point. DuVernay doesn't turn away, and gives it the harrowing edge of an action film. If she is at all manipulative as a filmmaker, it's for the right reasons for this story. Get people taking notice, not sitting there too complacent at a boilerplate story of black uprising. The way she shoots and executes the action, and how the actors play it - it matters.<br/><br/>Oh, and to briefly address this because it's come up: and Johnson doesn't really come off that well in the film. But you know what? He's not the main focus of the movie anyway. Selma is; even King is, even as the leader, still just a part of the puzzle. He doesn't seem like the most high-minded president, but as a CHARACTER, not a historical figure, he works well for the conflict of the film. If King could walk into the Oval office, ask for voting rights for African-Americans, and LBJ goes 'alright', there's no movie.<br/><br/>certainly has more conflict about him as a politician than George Wallace (both Wilkinson and Roth are good on screen, if over-shadowed by Oyelowo and Carmen Ojojo Coretta Scott King), and ultimately I was okay with his portrayal in the MOVIE. If I want more I can check out the Caro books or, when the time comes, Cranston as LBJ when the HBO movie comes out this year.<br/><br/>The filmmaking is just so charged and vital, but DuVernay knows how to make her film in tones of darkness - a room will be without light, but she has a way of getting us to feel the presence in a room, that weight that King carries is made cinematic as far as being a moral figure who still has to stay alive and keep his family alive. The filmmakers knew it was a subject that has 'Important' going in to it. The question is how to make the performances count - and almost all of them do - and how to make scenes move and flow dramatically speaking.<br/><br/>Even supporting characters like John Lewis gets a strong turn and dimension, and one scene where an 82 year old man, who has lost a family member due to police brutality, has a hear-to-heart with King, it's impossible not to feel the emotion there, and it works. Selma works."

","Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were enthralled with David Oyelowo's performance of playing the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as both a human being and great speaker. Carmen Ejogo-who I didn't remember seeing playing the same role in Boycott back in 2001-was also fine as his wife Coretta especially when she asked something concerning his supposed affairs. I was also impressed with Tom Wilkinson as a President Lyndon Johnson who seemed reluctant to deal with the voting rights march in Selma as something to deal with head on but seemed on the way to all out support by the end. In summary, Selma was quite a fine historical drama about a very important moment in civil rights history."

","This was an amazing depiction of a moment in the life of Dr. King. I loved seeing this side of him because we like to make our great leaders like Jesus, Ghandi, and Martin L. King martyrs. This depiction made him human with human flaws.If anyone wants to see how Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Jesse Jackson got their activism style from,this movie will show it was from Dr. King.He met at the White House with President Johnson, you had J.B. Hoover threatened to take him out, the government wiretapping his phones, and Governor George Wallace doing whatever he could to stop him.He also knew how to used the media to his advantage and understood his mortality and his importance.The millenials, especially black youth need to see this movie so they can understand the importance of why it is importance to vote. What our ancestors went through to get the right to vote and how it was all political and about legacies. How he used the media to show the world what Black Americans went through for the simple right to vote. It is haunting how the images of 1965 are parallel to the bruality of the streets of Ferguson. How the boys killed in nonviolent marches reflects the unarmed black men getting murdered today by the cops today. I wasn't going to watch this movie thinking it was another The Help or Precious, but I was so wrong. It is very uplifting towards the African American community and is in the league of Spike Lee's Malcolm X, 12 Years A Slave, and now Selma. And the music took it to another level especially the ending song Glory performed by Common and John Legend and how Common tied the events of Fergurson today into the events of Selma. Anyway, I loved the movie. I recommend everyone to go watch it. It is a perfect example of how powerful we are when come together as one race regardless of our differences and skin color."

","Selma is a magnificent, inspiring, and massively watchable film that does not shy from the politics or from showing King as a man. Above all, though, this is the film that bothers to take its research very seriously. As many of us, I have studied in depth the Rights Movement. The attention to historic detail, without glorification or hagiography is commendable. The attempts to use actors that look like the person they portray, excellent, and the tone and mood of the film is a truly fitting depiction.<br/><br/>The Civil Rights movement took the impetus and teachings of Gandhi (King traveled to India and stayed in Ashrams in 1959 in order to understand NVDA) and coupled that with the true spirit of Southern Baptism - and found their leader in King.<br/><br/>There has been nothing like Attenborough's Gandhi for King. Partly because of internal rights (and it is too complicated to explain here, but worth research) and partly because other attempts have not captured the true spirit of both sides. Where Selma succeeds massively is that it captures deeply what both sides believed in - the incredible bigotry is shown as is - the film shows that morality, justice, and the dignity of men lies in justice and fairness and that such freedoms are worth all; then and now. This is a film that inspires young and old people and reminds us all that we can do and do better.<br/><br/>Selma is a clear and sincere historical account of the events of late summer 1965 that would lead to LBJ enacting the Vote Act - it is powerful tribute to one of the most important events of 20th Century American history."

This movie will also be a great learning tool for educators. In addition, this movie will be a great way to bring awareness across cultures and generations.

","Selma was an incredibly well-done movie. The theater I attended was a diverse mixture of blacks, whites, young and old. Most sat virtually silent the entire movie. The two people that left during the movie rushed out and hurried back to their seats, an indication they did not want to miss any part of this historic presentation.<br/><br/>As someone who is reasonably astute about the Civil Rights era, I found Selma to be a reminder of how far America has advanced as a nation in some areas, yet lacking in others. The movie's depiction of the relationship with police officers to the violence and racism towards Blacks of the Civil Rights era is remarkable similar to the relationships with the African American community today. Upon leaving the theater, my husband and I discussed the similarity of their actions to incidents like Mike Brown in Ferguson,MO and Eric Garner in NY and countless others. That mindset still exist today.<br/><br/>The casting and acting was impeccable with David Ayelowo who played Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King looking very similar to their real life characters.

"Hellmant","9","4","9","16 January 2015"," Not one of my favorite films of the year but still one of the most important.
","'SELMA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>One of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014, and another big Oscar hopeful, is this historical drama film about the 1965 voting rights marches, led by Martin Luther King, Jr.. It was directed by Ava DuVernay (who made history this year by being the first black female director to ever be nominated for a Golden Globe award) and written by first time feature film writer Paul Webb. The movie stars David Oyelowo as King and costars Tom Wilkinson, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr. and many others. It's drawn controversial criticisms, from some, for being historically inaccurate in it's portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson and DuVernay was also forced to write new versions of King's speeches, for the movie, due to another film studio owning the rights to them. While the movie is not one of my favorite films of the year, I do still think it's one of the most important.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (Oyelowo) three month long battle to secure equal voting rights, in 1965; alongside James Bevel (Common), Rev. Horsea Williams (Wendell Pierce), John Lewis (Stephan James) and other civil rights activists. The film details the historical march they led, from Selma to Montgomery, and the horrendous opposition they faced, from bigoted legal forces. Wilkinson plays President Johnson; who was eventually persuaded to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as a result of their heroic actions. Critics of the film say Johnson is displayed too much as an opponent to King, when he in fact was a compassionate ally. Historians are divided on the truth to these claims.<br/><br/>The film contains a Golden Globe award winning song, titled 'Glory' (performed by Common and John Legend), which references the current protests in Ferguson. I think the parallels drawn between the struggles of equality now, with the 60s, show how much King and other protesters were able to accomplish, while still illustrating how far we need to go today. This is why I think 'SELMA' is one of the most important movies of the year, despite it being far from perfect. Oyelowo is fantastic in the lead and Winfrey, Wilkinson and others give good performances as well; but I think actors like Ejogo and Common are a bit lacking, in their roles. At times the movie feels a little too melodramatic, and slow paced; it also doesn't quite feel like it reaches it's full emotional potential (it seems like the subject matter could have been even more moving and inspiring). I do think DuVernay did a great job directing the film but perhaps the screenplay could have used a little more fine- tuning. I don't have a problem with the possible historical inaccuracies of the story; it's an artistic interpretation of events, not a documentary, and it's impossible to say who's right or wrong in such debates. While I do think the movie could have been even better I still think it's a really well made film and one that needs to be seen, by pretty much everyone.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/fbw9P594Crc"
"trelerke-politics","6","4","9","16 January 2015"," good as a slice of history, good acting, slow, overly reverential plot
","This is not a movie to be entertained by, more like eating your vegetables, it's overly long, does provide some insight into this specific moment in the civil rights movement but does a disservice, oft discussed, to LBJ. Further, the screenplay is very uneven and the movie just feels too long. Back to LBJ, by almost all historical accounts, his push for civil rights was historic, heroic and heart felt, at the expense of political considerations. Indeed, his efforts allowed the Republican southern strategy to flourish, something he knew might happen but was still considered worth doing simply because it was right. Indeed, if it wasn't for Vietnam, LBJ would have been considered one of the great presidents of the 20th century. So, the confrontation between King and LBJ were ginned up for the purposes of dramatic effect, which I understand, but is simply historically inaccurate. The director admitted as much. Anyway, this is a worthy movie that is not great art. Kind of like 12 years a slave, dutiful, necessary, but really not much more. (except Tim Roth's performance, he rocks, per the usual)"

The supporting cast did well enough and I did enjoy the song by Common and John Legend.<br/><br/>However, where the film fell a little flat for me was that, though this depicts true events, is that it followed so many of the Hollywood clich√©s such as slowing down a shot during a violent scene, telling the audience what to feel and when to feel it and that annoys me, particularly in a historical film because it is so unnecessary. I don't dislike the film, its a well put together film, I was just a little underwhelmed. It's absolutely worth watching but anyone expecting to see something as good as say ""12 years a slave"" will be disappointed.<br/><br/>As for the Oscar snub, well, based on the film I've seen, it really didn't deserve that much attention from the Academy, regardless of the topic it deals with.

I loved the glamorous tributes to real life heroes from the entertainment world who made a difference, such a Harry Belafonte. (Best musical moment: The whole cast singing ""Daylight come and we want to go home."") I loved the inspiring images of Americans both black and white gathering together at the bridge in the name of freedom. I even loved the way English actor Tim Roth (a hero of mine since RESERVOIR DOGS) played racist Alabama governor George Wallace as the ultimate Snidely Whiplash villain, relishing his extravagantly exaggerated Southern accent and his genuinely chilling lack of human feeling in every scene.<br/><br/>I loved all of it, but . . .<br/><br/>I wish that someday we could have a movie that goes beyond the early, innocent days of the Civil Rights movement. Dr. King to the end of his life was haunted by the way non-violence failed as a strategy in big northern cities like Chicago and Boston. Why did the movement fall apart? What went wrong in the cities? Why did white immigrants in the north (Poles, Italians, the Irish) resist integration with even more savage fury than poor whites in the south? Why did young blacks turn to violence instead of peaceful protest? Oh, let's not think about that . . . let's make another movie about Birmingham and Selma! I understand that Dr. King's adultery was shameful and inexcusable, but I wish that the outraged-wife scene (complete with Coretta's stony silence and lavishly recorded male moans) could have been less prim and judgmental. The movie gives too much weight to King's extra-marital affairs, in a way calculated to gratify the female audience. When a protester being beaten to death gets six seconds of screen time, while the wronged wife gets ten minutes to sulk and pout, it's hard not to feel that someone's been watching to much OPRAH.<br/><br/>Who produced this movie, anyway?

The fact that ""Roth"" gets raving reviews, ""Common"" the surprisingly exception, ( which I'm sure a few of you didn't expect he could do something else other than rapping'), and the comment about Oprah Winfrey acting in Black movies. Why in hell would someone comment about that? Of course, this movie isn't perfect, because life in general, especially during the civil rights movement to the present day wasn't and isn't a movie. The times of civil rights were not dramatized and exaggerated on a movie screen and for people who were looking for dramatics were stupid enough to look for it. What it comes down to is that it doesn't matter what some reviewers think when it comes to Black movies and Black actors. There's always going to be something negatively written or mentioned, i.e., The Butler, The Colored Purple, The Help etc. What all actors are looking to do is act and portray true life events as it happened...

David Oyelowo will probably get an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>-The characters are well written and portrayed, but alittle preachy. In fact one of the things I noticed is that the film is much more preachy than like 12 Years A Slave.<br/><br/>-The music is fitting, but I never liked the style used. Very gospely. It is a true story, so I can't judge it too hard, but it is still hard to enjoy at times. It is still a pretty powerful film! -The costume design is something to give a shout-out to, because it was incredibly authentic.<br/><br/>-Selma holds a PG-13 rating and is heavy on language for a PG-13 film.<br/><br/>-Selma is a powerful film that tells a true story in an original fashion, but it is slow and preachy. However, its positive elements outweigh the negative by far, which means that if you are looking for a thinking-man's period piece about race, Selma is worth seeing in theaters! I would give Selma a strong 7.5."

","I saw ""Selma"", starring David Oyelowo-Interstellar, Jack Reacher; Carmen Ejogo-The Purge:Anarchy, Alex Cross; Tom Wilkinson-The Lone Ranger_2013, The Green Hornet_2011 and Tim Roth-The Incredible Hulk_2008, Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>This is not really an autobiography about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. but it does cover an important slice of his life. David plays the reverend MLK jr, who, among other things, led a crusade to get voting rights for African-Americans in 1965. The title of the movie refers to the southern town of Selma, Alabama where the historic battle began, and the journey ended up in Montgomery, Alabama. Carmen plays David's wife, Coretta. Tom plays the president-LBJ-and Tim plays governor George Wallace. For those uninformed about the time period, it was pretty bad for anyone with dark skin. Blacks were not treated equally, especially in the south, even though legally, they were supposed to be. David pleaded with Tom for changes in legislation but it was slow in coming-it just was not a high priority. The marches and demonstrations which David led were peaceful and non-violent, at least on their part. It took being shown some of the atrocities on the nightly news before a lot of eyes were opened for the rest of the country. Oprah Winfrey was a producer of the film and she also has a small role in it. If you are interested in the subject matter, it is an eye-opener. I'm old enough to remember watching a lot of it on TV, as it was happening. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language-the N word is used a lot- and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be alright as a rental."

","Every so often, there comes a film that shakes you to your very being, to your very core. One that has you meditating, ruminating and questioning the world that was and the world that currently is. A film that leaves you awakened and inspired, rejoicing with pride, crying uncontrollably, for the raw unadulterated emotions it imbues emanate forth and leave you floored. That film is Selma.<br/><br/>Selma showcases the harrowing hardships and struggles, the pain and loss, the strife and humiliations faced by the African American people during the fight for justice and equality, the civil rights movement. It is a film about breaking down racial barriers, stereotypes and prejudices of all kinds, in addition to embracing each other as human beings. It is about the coming together of people across a nation, irrespective of race, peacefully protesting the human rights abuses that ran rampant like a plague as a result of racism. A true and defining chapter in modern history is witnessed, one whose truths and messages reverberate through the annals of history and are just as powerfully potent and relevant today as they were back then. <br/><br/>Selma doesn't portray MLK as the perfect paragon of sainthood, instead choosing to focus on the man himself, a man who had his crises, a human being who like any other had his faults and flaws. This not only highlights his humanity and strength but demonstrates his passion, convictions, commitment, courage, compassion, humaneness and justness. He was an ordinary man who accomplished great things. A very inspiring and human focus on the man shows the great writing and respect the crew and cast had.<br/><br/>Even though Martin Luther King, Jr., portrayed with profound insight in an Oscar-worthy turn by David Oyelowo, is at the forefront of this magnificent film, it is essentially about Selma, Alabama. Selma and it's people are the main characters, a town on the brink of a social revolution for justice, a place where an explosive boiling point in a long unending struggle has been reached and enough is enough. It shows one of the many examples in the sixties and earlier of the dehumanizing of innocents, the unjust stripping of the rights of people, the unnecessary and heartrending bloodshed, the horrors of human rights abuses, the brutality and cruelty faced by the people. Even today we see these horrors experienced worldwide by people of different races, sexes, sexual orientations, religions and more, so the release of this film couldn't have been more timely. <br/><br/>With powerful, explosive and heartbreaking global themes of monumental proportion handled with class, dignity and respect aside, Selma is a triumph, firing from all cylinders as a must-see cinematic event. The grand nature of the gorgeously rendered production is breathtaking. The scale and scope, the costumes and cinematography are truly stunning. The roles are filled to perfection by a cast so talented and committed especially David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo who are a sight to behold. Their chemistry, preparation and investment, heart and soul, in these characters is abundantly clear and they render star-making performances. The soundtrack is forceful and rhythmic with each note teeming with emotional undercurrents. Most importantly, the writing and direction are in a class of their own, so brilliant and emotive; Ava DuVernay has created a masterpiece of cinema with her masterful vision.<br/><br/>A critically acclaimed masterpiece, this soulful and heartfelt film is a testament to the power of the medium. Yes, there is a controversy currently surrounding the film's accuracy. This is a movie after all with entertainment being one of the primary goals, so such squabbles are hardly worth mentioning. I mean, the film isn't being touted as a second-by-second documentary on the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. or a detailed biography. It is a movie, a canvas, to show what once was, horrors and abuses, a social commentary that is both shocking and thought-provoking. The message is what counts, equality and humanity. Ava DuVernay has taken a very important topic and created a powerhouse of a film, artistic as well as a classic for generations to come. Irrespective of race, this film is for everyone. One of the most human and emotional experiences I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on the silver screen. Well done to all those involved."

","Selma offers a look back on the attitudes of the United States particularly the deep south during the period just after the passing of The Civil Rights Act in 1964. At that time Negroes were granted the right to vote. But in those deep south States The film focuses on Alabama where although Negroes were given the right to vote the state government of Alabama put every obstacle in there path to prevent them from voting from Poll Taxes to test of Civics knowledge. We see how The Reverend Dr. Marten Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo- in a remarkable performance) led the marches into Selma over the Edward Pettus Bridge where the marchers were met with both a State Police and Armed Citizens attacking them so they could not march over that bridge . As the peaceful protesters being met with violence started showing up on the front pages of morning newspapers and nightly network newscast the attitude of the nation began swinging in favor of Dr. King and the protesters posed a huge problem for President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkson) who was going through a election season. It was tough watching some of those violent scenes with police clubbing and kicking protesters both black and white marching in a peaceful manner. Fifty years later those same scenes are playing out today on our HD TV Screens as police still are attacking and shooting unarmed citizens dead without retribution. It's a awesome film that moves a bit slow in segments of it's 128 minute length. AL Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) is portrayed as a out and out racist not willing to step in for what's right thus angering President Johnson. to the point where the President talking to Wallace on how history will look at both men in 1984 telling Wallace I don't want anyone putting me in the same light as you (not exact wording) There was one major error of one scene The segment in the film where President Johnsonis addressing a joint session of Congress on ""The Voting Rights Act"" (March- 15-1965) The House Mace which sits on it's pedestal when the House is in session is missing. (The design of the mace is derived from ancient battle weapon¬†and the Roman fasces. The ceremonial mace is 46 inches high and consists of 13 ebony ¬†rods ‚Äì representing the¬†original 13 states¬†of the¬†Union‚Äì bound together by silver strands criss -crossed over the length of the pole.

","Selma wants you to think of it as a serious movie about a serious subject. In other words, it is supposed to be a masterful work of art. The result, however, leaves to be desired. Although all the hype surrounding Martin Luther King (who is, in fact, a rather important historical figure - but his elevation to the status of a secular saint is somewhat disturbing) ensured throngs would converge on movie theaters to watch this movie almost out of a sense of moral obligation, the movie itself is plagued by mediocre acting, pretentious dialogs and odd camera angles. In fact, seeing this movie reminded me of my experience watching ""Lincoln"": everyone having seen this movie felt obligated to say how deep and moving it was, but secretively, they were just glad to be over with it."

It changed lives in the theater and it changed mine too. (Not saying I judge black people because I don't. I think everyone is the same)There was not a dry eye in the theater.

"matthewssilverhammer","9","4","10","16 January 2015"," A Dramatically Stirring Humanizing of History
","This movie is called Selma, NOT ""The Martin Luther King Jr. Story"", for a reason. The intensity and significance of the Civil Rights movement is captured all through one seemingly small, but ultimately huge, demonstration. And while King's a more than prominent part of this story, and is even the de facto protagonist, Selma was a victory for more than one individual, and DuVernay and co. know that. With a beautiful lead performance by Oyelowo, this is stirring and engrossing dramatic filmmaking that humanizes history and an icon, embracing every part of the ugly truth. Selma doesn't rely on lazy-biopic gimmicks to catch us up to speed. The filmmakers rightly assume a basic knowledge of King and his impact. This gives the story room to breathe, letting the depth of details and emotions hold the screen over dry facts. We get to see the heartbreak of the injustice up-close, the politicking of all reigning parties (including a fascinating look at the White House), the fear and difficulty inherent in true non-violent protests, and the ultimate hope of goals reached. The script has a few dull moments that could've hit the editing room floor, and some of the casting could be seen as stereotypes, but there is intentionality to director DuVernay's subtly dusty yet intensely personal film. Really, it's hard not to feel personal about Selma, given the state of current racial unrest. We are far from past the teachings of Dr. King, but a devastating-yet-forward-looking film like this can help us learn to see the complexity inherit and necessity in justice. Selma isn't emotionally manipulative; it is emotionally necessary."
"lace412","10","5","14","11 January 2015"," Best Biopic Since Malcom X
","This is my first IMDb review. I was so moved by this movie that I felt it was necessary to write one. I am a black male. My mom dragged me to this movie. I did not like the Butler -which she loved- and did not see 12 years a slave. Honestly, I am tired of these types of movies. But boy was I wrong about Selma.<br/><br/>*Spoiler Alert The movies starts with a dramatic scene. You hear young girls in a church talking about Coretta Scott King's hair. I thought this was a very powerful scene. You could imagine that girls of a similar age might talk about our First Lady -Michelle Obama- and how and she wears her hair. They were talking about how much they admired her. Then boom you see the church blow up in the famous bombing. I wasn't expecting that. I knew about the incident, but it was enough of a surprise that it grabbed my attention. <br/><br/>*End of Spoilers-- From there you see the main actor absolutely BECOME Martin Luther King. David's performance was nothing short of spectacular. He really embodied MLK. He sounded like him. He talked like him. He was him. Even though he does not really look just like him at times you close your eyes and feel as if you are hearing MLK speak. He was very strong with his sermons and speeches throughout the movie. I was also impressed that the director wrote the speeches because of copywrite reasons.<br/><br/>Where I thought the movie truly shined was that it gave you a behind the scenes look at the politics behind the march at Selma. *Spoiler - A lot has been made about supposed historical inaccuracies between MLK and Lyndon Johnson (LBJ). I couldn't disagree more. From what we know about LBJ he was a very complex man. The movie does not paint him as necessarily racist. It shows him as a POLITICIAN. It shows him as a man concerned with his legacy. I thought this was very believable. History has told us that yes Johnson did care about civil rights. And I thought the movie showed that he did with his conversation with George Wallace. But it is not inaccurate to say that he cared about playing politics. He wanted to create a legacy. He wanted to stand on the right side of history. To me it kind of seemed like how Abraham Lincoln receives praise for freeing the slaves, when really all he cared about was preserving the union. Does that make Abraham Lincoln a bad person or what he did any less commendable? I think not.<br/><br/>This quote from LBJ really sums up how the movie dealt with the LBJ/MLK relationship. ""These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference... I'll have them n***** voting Democratic for the next two hundred years"".<br/><br/>To me the movie painted LBJ not as a saint as some would like it, but as a complex man who did have some progessive views on race for a Southern Democrat, played politics, did not seem to be terribly racist, but wasn't the white saint/savior some people hope for. I digress sorry for this rant.<br/><br/>As far as Tom Wilkinson's portrayal seemed fair and he did an adequate job playing the character.<br/><br/>As for MLK he was not painted as a saint either. We see a man who has some demons. We get a very dramatic scene between him and Coretta where she asks him about his extra-marital affairs. It was very well done and the director was not afraid to go there and present a balanced view of who MLK was.<br/><br/>This movie really did keep me on the edge of my seat. What I think worked the best was the fact that it followed a short period of time. This allowed for more detail. We got to see those meetings between MLK and his inner circle. We got to see disagreement in strategy among the leaders. We got to see that MLK was tired and beat down from leading the movement. We saw MLK as a human being rather than the deity or legend that he has become.<br/><br/>Overall 10/10. Unbelievable movie. I will be going to see it again MLK weekend."
"ian-dodkins","6","3","7","24 January 2015"," lead didn't have the charisma nor the understanding of the role
","Admittedly a demanding role to play, but I can't help thinking that the lead actor should have read MLKs 'auto'biography. King was an extremely intelligent and philosophical man who chose every single word with precision. He knew very well the layers of meaning he was putting under different speeches. Unfortunately, even when the actual speeches were being quoted the principle actor bored me.<br/><br/>Some scenes were over played and without subtlety, thereby losing their impact, though I thought the explosion scene was well timed. The flow of the plot was staggered and I found it difficult to really associate with the characters. It is quite 2 dimensional and, though good in parts, on the whole it was just not good story telling - which is unnerving given how good a story it was to start with.<br/><br/>In all, the only thing I found surprising was how such an important event, when dramatised, could fall so flat... a nice Sunday afternoon film when you are nibbling cheese and biscuits and chatting occasionally."
"Red-125","10","5","15","13 January 2015"," A truly great movie about a terrible time
","Selma (2014) was directed by Ava DuVernay. It stars David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. The story of the film is based on reality--50 years ago thousands of brave people attempted to walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and were terrorized by local and state police before they finally succeeded.<br/><br/>A disclaimer at the end of the film tells us that, although the movie is based on actual events, it isn't a documentary. Fair enough-- Shakespeare's History plays aren't based on strict facts and chronology either. What we want from this film is fact that is portrayed dramatically, and ""Selma"" delivers.<br/><br/>It's probably hard for young people to believe that segregation and race hatred were the norm in our nation just 50 years ago. (Yes, the South was worse than other parts of the country, but segregation was everywhere.) We now take it for granted that everyone has the right to vote, and that we can have an African-American President.<br/><br/>""Selma"" shows us how this progress came about. It came about because of the incredible bravery of African-American people, and because of the astute tactics of the leaders of the civil rights movement.<br/><br/>Both Oyelowo and Ejogo are superb actors, and very believable in their roles. Oyelowo looks something like Dr. King, so we can say, ""close enough."" Ejogo looks exactly like Coretta Scott King--I found the resemblance uncanny.<br/><br/>This movie will repay your time by providing both history and drama. The story needs to be heard by young people, but, in my opinion, the violence is so terrible, and so realistic, that young children shouldn't be in the audience. That's too bad, because--aside from that caveat-- I think everyone should be in the audience. We need to hold on to this part of our history to remember where we were, where we are, and how we got from there to here.<br/><br/>The movie will probably work better on the large screen, but, if you can't see it in a theater, see it on DVD. Just be sure to see it!<br/><br/>Note on the IMDb rating: As I'm writing this review, ""Selma"" has an excellent rating of 7.7. However, the distribution of votes is strange. 68% of reviewers gave it an 8, 9, or 10. However, 424 people--almost 9%--rated the film as 1. I'm going to start a thread asking, ""Why did you give this film a rating of 1?"" People who gave it a rating of 1 must have had their reasons. What were those reasons? We'll see who answers, and what they say."
"uptonian","8","4","11","23 January 2015"," Review: Selma (2014) - A Stunning Biopic For The Ages
","""White, Black and otherwise..come to Selma.""<br/><br/>Selma has taken America by storm. Ava DuVernay directs a film that proves both pivotal and timely to our nation. In typicality, I try to stay away from other opinions on a film before viewing it or composing my own opinions. I hate to borrow from people, and verbiage is no exception. However, with Selma, I found my usual mode of cinematic sequestering difficult in this instance, as the film is consistently lauded as the best film of the year across the internet and all of social media. For the week or so prior to me composing this review, it held a ""100% Certified Fresh"" accolade on Rotten Tomatoes. My hopes for this film were quite high, indeed, and I am pleased to share that I was not, in the least bit, let down.<br/><br/>We open on Martin Luther King Jr., played by British actor David Oyelowo (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Interstellar), speaking with his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) prior to his December 10, 1964 reception of the Nobel Prize at the University of Oslo in Norway. We follow him to Norway as he receives his award. As his acceptance speech is given (more on this film's depiction of Martin Luther King Jr.'s public speeches later) we view a portrayal of the gut-wrenching events of September 15th, 1963, in which four small children were killed when a bomb was detonated in Birmingham, Alabama's 16th St. Baptist Church. A sobering opening to a beautiful and important film.<br/><br/>In years past, the King family has been said to make depictions of Martin Luther King Jr. virtually a nightmare to pursue. King's speeches are copyrighted works and property of the King Estate, who have not been openly supportive of Ava DuVernay's production. Reason being that they already licensed the spoken works of MLK to Dreamworks and Warner Bros. in 2009 for a yet-produced, yet-to-be-titled biopic (Source: The Hollywood Reporter), and the studios were unable to make a deal providing a shared use of Dr. Martin Luther King's words. Stingy much? But I digress, the lack of cooperation or support from any of the aforementioned has obviously not stopped this train. The words in the speeches and sermons we see in Selma are made specifically for the film. This is a positive! They took what they had to work with and created sharp dialog; both poignant and uplifting moments in Dr. King's speeches. The sermons are exquisitely crafted to run parallel to King's actual speeches, whilst avoiding infringement upon the copyrighted works, themselves.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo delivers every line with a vigor and passion that should launch him into, at the very least, a category nomination for Best Actor, come the Oscars (if not the win). The supporting cast, while often outshone by Oyelowo, is great here too. To name only a few: Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B. Johnson, Giovanni Ribisi as Lee White, Oprah as Annie Lee Cooper, and Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace. The story's scope is much too large to truly spend a substantial amount of time with all of the supporting cast. Fortunately, there's so much authentic talent in the film, that there is never a lull on the screen.<br/><br/>This film comes at a time when our nation is struggling with understanding and peace, and for that matter, understanding peace itself. Selma endeavors to show us our error as a nation during the Civil Rights Movement, lest we not repeat it. Some sequences are an exposition of 1960's American Brutality, and thankfully, DuVernay pulls no punches here. The violence is visceral and true to the nature of the era. It is revolting, as it should be. Personally, I was sickened by the depictions, all of which occur within the confines of the PG-13 rating. Well done. Ava DuVernay has, with the help of her astounding cast, created a powerful and incredible biopic with Selma. It succeeds in it's goals, and in the end, it calls for unification and peace. Much like Dr. King would have wanted."
"natalierosen","9","4","11","19 January 2015"," ""Selma""‚Äîa film Review‚ÄîGod at his side
","No need to beat around the proverbial bush I loved this film. It took the highlights of the Alabama Edmund Pettus Bridge march for equality and the struggle for civil rights nearly fifty years ago and turned it into a film masterpiece.<br/><br/>This amazing non-violent man, Dr. Martin Luther King, did things to improve the lives of millions; things that no one would or could have done and he did so in the face of humiliating provocation, hubristic insult and the crushing brutality by the forces of malevolence few could endure. He turned the other cheek for the haters to smash as well.<br/><br/>This film shows to those who knew him and to the youth who can only study about him the inspirational charisma he possessed. He brought hope to hopeless millions and changed centuries of misery's darkness into the possibility of freedom's light. He brought his power to a recalcitrant, mean and vicious slice of oppositional white power and galvanized a nation of all colors, religions, and creeds to his moral cause.<br/><br/>We saw, through the communicative media of the time, the Edmund Pettus Bridge walkers bludgeoned when they tried to cross it by white and Confederate flag-flying racists as Dr. King forged a path for those that walked with him toward a better life.<br/><br/>People say for all the world to hear malevolent and mendacious things whether there is evidence for it or not against the giants of men and women upon whose shoulders we stand for the progress of mankind.<br/><br/>The larger truth was that a David honed justice against a Goliath of Billy clubs and bats. ""Selma"" was a snap shot of that time. It was a time of attack dogs, fire hoses and police Billy clubs used on old men, old women, children and anything black (and sometimes white) that got in the way of a white life of privilege. Persons of color wanted to merely sit anywhere on a bus, anywhere in a movie theater, at any lunch counter or, indeed, the right to vote free of literacy tests no one could pass and poll taxes many not afford.<br/><br/>Dr. King helped extricate his people as the metaphorical Moses of Biblical antiquity allegedly led the slaves out of Egypt. He was historically huge and this film portrayed him as that. I do not care about his personal life that some scurrilously impugn nor do I care about small poetic justice historical error there may in the film. I care about what Dr. King did for those who lived under the jackboot of a backward brutal south that tried to crush people of color for any invented reason they could think.<br/><br/>The movie, ""Selma"" was great. We who empathize with those who suffer injustice and who are on the side of the arc of justice as it bends towards it will love this film for the truth it brings.<br/><br/>The lessons, though, are for our time as well. Again the shouts of injustice fall on seemingly deaf ears. The deaths of innocent Black men whether at the site of a burning cross, at the base of a Poplar tree or at the hands of some present-day bully can be seen in our nation now. Voter suppression, intimidation and hardship with the most egregious ""conservative"" Supreme Court nullification of the most important part of the 1965 Voting Right Act exist in our time. They have now the blood on their hands that so many shed to attain what rightfully should be America's promise to everyone. The efforts of Dr. King and those who followed cannot have been in vain.<br/><br/>On Martin Luther King Day I say rest in peace, Dr. King, and may you be for all time at the side of the God in whom you believed!"
"FilmMuscle","6","4","11","10 January 2015"," Sentimentality Might Either Sway Or Throw You Off
","Every year, there has to be a civil rights/slavery film, right? Well, in case you hadn't understood the inhumanity of slavery and/or segregation yet, here's another history lesson to remind and make you cry. Selma focuses on a very, very brief portion of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life in his valiant march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama so as to protest and pressure Lyndon B. Johnson into finally passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Although African-Americans technically had the right to vote during this time, there was nothing stopping the white authorities from intimidating black people far away from voting booths. Martin Luther King, Jr. will not have any of it though, and David Oyelowo, in his remarkable depiction of King, certainly conveys this through his partially melancholic and partially fierce ""enough-of- this!"" eyes. Aside from the striking resemblance to the esteemed civil rights leader, Oyelowo absolutely brings everything he emotionally has within him to the platform during every one of his profound and furious speeches. <br/><br/>And given the perfect timing of the film's release, relevant more than ever in the midst of relentless police brutality and continuing African-American injustice, the ferocity of the movement here is undoubtedly inspiring and rousing. The wonderful ensemble‚Äîincluding the likes of Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, and Common‚Äîall know what's at stake in the past and present, but Tom Wilkinson (as President Johnson) and Tim Roth (as the repugnant George Wallace) also add contemplation and determined vehemence, respectively, to the opposing side. The lachrymose 60's soundtrack plays to ferociously shot and edited sequences of the marches and the consequential police brutality that strikes back. <br/><br/>If you can't tell by now, my writing seems to be largely formed by sentimentality and closeness to the horrific predicament at hand in 2014 America. Frankly, Selma is a film that affects more through sentimental bias than anything else. Once everything is said and done‚Äî once a colder and more objective perspective that strips the relevance of the subject matter has been established‚ÄîSelma really is a standard biopic that actually doesn't develop King into that much of a compelling character. The picture does make sure to highlight the usual family drama that occurs behind closed doors in every biopic from Malcolm X to Lincoln, but I just couldn't see enough of the man besides the obviously glorious, saintly portrait in which he's painted. <br/><br/>Moreover, with the exception of the few marches/protests that rivetingly transpire throughout the film's duration, the pacing is unexpectedly plodding, and that's in large part because of how little material the film has to work with. Conversations that drag on for far too long essentially focus on one element of conversation: the planned march and of its hopeful results. Imagine that continuing on for a 2+- hour movie. Add in the fact that Selma suffers from quite a bit of historical inaccuracies, including the more negative representation of Lyndon B. Johnson, solely to implement further dramatic weight and conflict as overly-dramatized Hollywood films typically love to indulge themselves in. <br/><br/>Of course, it'll still be an overwhelmingly celebrated film in its year of release much like 12 Years a Slave was last year (even though The Wolf of Wall Street and Her come up in more discussions a year later). It happens every time with the critics and awards industry players. Ask yourself: will Selma‚Äîa finely-crafted film that means well but is narratively and creatively forgettable/safe‚Äîhonestly be remembered more than fascinatingly daring content this year like Inherent Vice and Interstellar?"

","There is an old saying that art - even the glossy, fanciful stuff that you see written about in the all the fancy magazines and news articles - does have some bottom-line commercial concerns, as well as providing a form of entertainment.<br/><br/>There is also something to be said about motion pictures regarding real-life historical events. While they are made to bring attention to, or bring to life either long-forgotten or recent events in history, they are, at base level, concerned primarily with providing a form of entertainment, and will sometimes fudge the real-life facts for the sake of providing said entertainment.<br/><br/>Any film based on true-life events will face this problem. I would guess that for anyone wanting 100% facts, then they should go watch a documentary or go read a book.<br/><br/>I just got done watching Ava DuVernay's 2014 Oscar-Winner ""Selma,"" about the marches and demonstrations in 1965 in Selma, Alabama, that led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which extended voting rights to all people of color. The timing of the release of ""Selma"" could not have been more perfect, in my eyes.<br/><br/>I first heard about ""Selma"" late last year, probably around this time, actually. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unceremoniously struck down a crucial portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 - specifically Section 4(b), which was for the so-called ""coverage formula"" for jurisdictions, mostly in the South, with proved, documented histories of egregious voting discriminations, including, regretfully, my home state of Virginia - a moment in recent history that shamefully received very little coverage in the news media of the time and to this day almost three years later still infuriates me.<br/><br/>(It both saddens and frustrates me to think about how with the stroke of a pen, how so much has been lost in the 50 years since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 became law.)<br/><br/>And then, the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" was just this past March (March 7), an event which also did not receive a whole lot of coverage in the media, but I do remember seeing a few items on the news and on Facebook (of all places) of people, many of whom were there in 1965, walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge - just as they had done 50 years earlier.<br/><br/>And ""Selma"" was released during the time between the two momentous occasions.<br/><br/>These events in recent history - and the current racial unrest and unease in this country - only serve to increase the demand that all Americans see ""Selma."" I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time, but I only recently gave it a viewing today. I had heard long before I saw ""Selma"" that DuVernay's film was not entirely true to historical events, in particular the relationship between Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo, who received a well-deserved Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, but was shunned by the Oscars) and then-United States President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). I know from my understanding of history that President Johnson was actually the greatest political ally of the Civil Rights Movement, but was still under enormous pressure to go through with his own ""Great Society"" programs and the escalating U.S. military conflict in Vietnam. In other words, they both wanted the same thing - the dismantling of Jim Crow - but just had different responsibilities and priorities.<br/><br/>In fact, according to one analysis of the picture and this slight by Slate earlier this year, ""...By hardening Johnson - and making him a larger roadblock than he was - DuVernay emphasizes the grass roots of the movement and the particular struggles of King and his allies. In the long argument of who matters most - activists or politicians - DuVernay falls on the side of the former; showing how citizens can expand the realm of the possible and give politicians the push - and the room - they need to act.""<br/><br/>In other words, the film is mostly about the activists who drove the federal government into drafting and eventually passing the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law - and it is largely told from their perspective. In fact, the two biggest stumbling blocks encountered by both the activists, led by King, and the federal government, led by Johnson, are FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth); in real life, it was actually U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy who authorized the FBI wiretaps and harassment of Dr. King and other Civil Rights Movement leaders in an attempt to discredit his leadership and link him to the Communist Party (the film depicts Johnson authorizing this, not Kennedy), and George Wallace often used the police to violently suppress peaceful demonstrations in his state, like on ""Bloody Sunday.""<br/><br/>Ava DuVernay's film isn't perfect; it's a little too wishy-washy in its liberal depiction of an extremely violent time in American history. But still, after seeing this movie finally (and taking into consideration recent historical events), I have now confirmed my feeling that ""Selma"" is the film that should have won Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year, but was shamefully overlooked by the Academy. That it only received one Oscar win (for ""Glory"" by Common and John Legend), which I suspect was done to placate certain members of the audience, is a real disservice to one of the greatest moments in American history that took place just 50 years ago.<br/><br/>10/10"

","SELMA is a very important movie depicting very important people in very important situations in an important place in U.S. history.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this movie is important?<br/><br/>Director Ava DuVernay crafts a serious motion picture about a serious subject - the Civil Rights movement culminating in the march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama in 1965. Led by the great Dr. Martin Luther King, this march was a seminal moment in the '60s Civil Rights movement. This picture reverently and seriously recounts those days and does a strong job doing so. It is a GOOD movie, but it is this seriousness, this reverence, that ultimately keeps this movie from being GREAT. It bogs itself down, at times, under the weight of it's own seriousness.<br/><br/>David Oyelowa plays Dr. King as a determined, moral man looking to drive change in his country. I need to give Oyelowa the highest praise I can for this type of bio-pic. He recreates the essence of Dr. King without being a mimic. I felt as if I was watching a real person and not an actor acting like a certain person.<br/><br/>Oyelowa is surrounded by a topnotch cast - Carmen Ejogo (as Coretta Scott King), Tim Roth (a welcome site as Gov. George Wallace), Tom Wilkinson (LBJ), Common, Wendell Pierce and Oprah Winfrey. Special notice should be paid to Lorraine Toussaint as Amelia Boynton. I've always thought that Toussaint was a fine, but unspectacular actress, but her performance in this movie has changed my mind about her. She was terrific.<br/><br/>Absolutely, SELMA is a movie that must be seen. It tells a story that needs to be told. Clearly, the filmmakers thought that as well and felt that importance, that weight as well.<br/><br/>8(out of 10) stars and you can take that to the BANK (of Marquis)"
"alanjflood","8","2","4","10 February 2015"," Impeccably tight, a steady and consistent beat toward the predictably triumphant and emotional finale
","From a European point of view, it would be difficult to approach Selma without the knowledge that the film is causing a controversial stir across the water in relation to its apparent exclusion from this year's Oscar nominations. The argument from some quarters in the States is that this proves that inherent racism exists within the Academy, others argue the film merely isn't worthy of the Oscar nods that some feel it deserve and furthermore there is the argument, probably closer to any truth, that the film was released slightly too late to generate sufficient Oscar momentum. However, David Oyelowo's omission from the best actor category is as glaring an injustice as there's been for several years.<br/><br/>Oyelowo, of course, plays Martin Luther King in, Avu Devurnay's Selma which is astoundingly the first feature film based on King's life to garner a theatrical release. Paul Webb's concise script is far from a biopic of King, it focuses solely on his third great political and social triumph, following the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955 and the March on Washington of 1963, in 1965 King and his supporters organised several marches in Selma, Alabama in protest against the discrimination suffered by black people attempting to register to vote.<br/><br/>As mentioned, David Oyelowo gives a moving performance as King, his interpretations of Kings rousing and poetic speeches hit all the right notes but it is the more sombre and personal moments in which Oyelowo depicts King's doubts and weariness that make it a great performance. Watch out particularly for the most painful scene in the film where King visits a hospital to console an elderly man whose son has been killed. Oyelowo says little in the scene, but his blood shot eyes depict a heap of emotions.<br/><br/>This is also true of the difficult scenes with his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) which depict the difficulties within King's home life. Indeed these difficulties lead him to vitally miss the first leg of the Selma march. Oyelowo is accompanied by a powerful supporting cast here from Opera to Cuba Gooding Junior, his supporters to his adversaries, specifically a despicable yet engrossing Tim Roth as well as Tom Wilkonson's intriguing take on Lyndon. B. Johnson. The script is impeccably tight, a steady and consistent beat toward the predictably triumphant and emotional finale. There isn't a scene in Avu Duvernay's film that doesn't need to be there, each sequence progresses the story forward at a timely pace.<br/><br/>Selma is everything you'd expect from an accomplished film about Martin Luther King. It showcases the vitriol and evil that King fought against in the form of local Southern law enforcement and officials as well as the added difficulty in playing politics and negotiating Washington bureaucracy. It touches briefly but adequately on his marital difficulties and his own unfaithfulness. What we walk out of Selma with is a sense of King's bravery and courage in such a hotbed of hatrid. 'Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe,' he states at one point.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable and gripping film, a tight script enhanced in its accessibility with the inclusion of infamous as well as courageous men of history. It leaves us with wonderment of how far we've come since 1965. It could be argued quite far, given how shocking the violent images of armed white police beating peaceful black protesters are today. However, recent events in Ferguson would lead you to question how far they've come in the Southern United Sates. Perhaps Martin Luther King's legacy still has further bridges to cross."

","It's really important, I think, not to mistake criticism of this rather run-of-the-mill drama with the actual achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King. Any re-telling of his story to new audiences especially to those who have (or had) no experience of just how African American's were practically, if not so much politically, treated has got to serve as a reminder that what we take for granted, we lose - and, like so many other hard fought rights and freedoms we must all continue to value them and work to ensure nobody is ever discriminated against - for any reason... This film, however, is really nothing special. The dramatic elements are awkwardly speculative - particularly the alleged conversations between President Johnson and MLK; the cast lacked any ability to engender the charisma and fortitude of their real life counterparts; the dialogue is way too wordy, the scenes too busy - constant camera movement distracting from the message that the film is trying to reinforce and I'm sorry but Tom Wilkinson as LBJ is just a bad casting choice - indeed the whole FBI wire-tapping business is delivered in a way that seems oddly routine and un-sinister. It is difficult to put together a decent biopic of such a visionary man and not let it slide into an overly-appreciative mire of sentimental mediocrity - and Ava DuVernay was possibly just too close to the subject matter to be remotely objective. It is an at times a rousing, but mostly a pedestrian effort."

"Cineanalyst","7","0","0","16 June 2020"," Politics of Historical Drama
","""Selma"" is a movie that seems will remain prominent in popular discourse on history and race for some time to come, at least if screenings of it continue to reappear every Martin Luther King Jr. Day and February during Black History Month, Paramount continues to stream it for free when racial issues are front-page news, or school teachers continue to look for something that seems both educational and a way to keep students quiet while they hardly do any work themselves. It's not as though there have been very many biopics of Martin Luther King Jr., either, or even historical pictures about the civil rights movement. As original and always timely as ""Selma"" may be in that regard, it otherwise seems similar to another political biopic, if not hagiography, ""Lincoln"" (2012). Both focus on historical figures who've reached saintly proportions in the American imagination, both for their leadership in struggles against racist legal systems, and both movies largely avoid the simplistic good-vs-evil plot of the hero squaring off against the baddie in favor of focusing on the internal politics of the movement, whether in working the votes to pass the 13th Amendment or, 100 years later, in organizing the Selma-to-Montgomery marches to raise the issue of the Voting Rights Act.<br/><br/>With less focus on the likes of Alabama Governor George Wallace or Sheriff Jim Clark as evil obstacles to overcome, although that is still there on the margins, ""Selma,"" instead focuses on conflicts between King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and John Lewis's branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, but most prominently and controversially, there's the picture's battle of wills between King and President Lyndon Johnson. I'm not a historical expert on the matter and so won't get into the weeds on how accurate the portrayal of LBJ is here or whether the filmmakers veered too far in their avoidance of white-savior tropes towards historical inaccuracy. Indeed, it seems odd to me that a president wouldn't be eager to pass a bill that guarantees voting rights to a constituency that reliably votes upwards of over 90% for their party, but, then, this was the same administration consumed by the Vietnam War, so perhaps his priorities were at least questionable. Regardless, there've since been a couple bland biopics on Johnson since, for those interested: ""All the Way"" and ""LBJ"" (both 2016).<br/><br/>By focusing on the likes of King, Lewis and company, at least we get a greater sense of the grass-roots nature of the civil rights movement. One doesn't get the same view from privileging Washington, especially from a president whose FBI director was actively undermining the civil rights movement, including by attacking the marriage of the King family, as seen in ""Selma."" These were rights achieved by activists and civilians, by shocking TV coverage of demonstrations and calls to action from the likes of King to galvanize people of all races to support equality. So, while ""Selma"" does partly follow a great-man-narrative with its focus on King, the trajectory of progress is from the ground up. There's a reason King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize shares the picture's opening with the tragedy of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and the everyday discrimination of Annie Lee Cooper (although casting Oprah Winfrey in this part arguably undermines the focus on common people somewhat) being denied the right to vote.<br/><br/>""Selma"" isn't perfect. Depicting the bombing in slow motion seems tactless. And the filmmakers don't entirely escape the pitfalls of the genre for grandstanding and speechifying even when characters aren't delivering speeches or in front of cameras. Nevertheless, David Oyelowo is outstanding as King--managing to appear forceful without being showy. The backstory of the internal politics behind the marches holds interest, and I like the inclusion of archival footage of the real event at the end. ""Selma"" is a palatable-enough treatment of historically significant events to be worthy of its prominence."
"cherold","8","0","0","15 June 2020"," Affecting movie with a strong focus on strategy
","This drama about MLK and the fight for voting rights in the south is notable for a few things. One is how well it establishes the stakes. Violence is a small part of the film but every violent moment is a gut punch that tells you how real and often indiscriminate the danger was. The forces of darkness gave no quarter.<br/><br/>It also gets into the strategy. This is less MLK the inspirational leader than it is Martin the strategist. His strategy includes putting people in danger and playing hardball, and at times he shrinks from the necessity of what must be done, but you see how effective that strategy is. (Oddly the movie doesn't explain the strategy of a certain retreat, although I found an explanation online).<br/><br/>While movies of real events often try and shrink participants into one or two, Selma isn't afraid to show how many people were a part of the movement. Many characters don't have much to do, but they're all in there, giving you a sense of a movement that's more than just one great man.<br/><br/>At the same time, David Oyelowo is good at the thoughtful part of MLK but falls short on the charisma, failing to capture that preacher cadence and that soaring rhetoric. I appreciate the egalitarian view, but still, MLK was often electric and Oyelowo just doesn't have that electricity.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an engrossing movie that offers a lot of historical information yet never falls into the educational-film trap of movie's like ""Lincoln."" It is effective both as history and drama. I recommend it for both."

","The 15th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing all Americans the right to vote was ratified in 1870, and yet almost a century later (1965) when the events of ""Selma"" transpired, no more than 2% of African-American citizens were registered to vote in many deep-South counties. And as we see in the beginning of Selma, you practically had to memorize the U.S. Constitution to satisfy the county registrars, but that still might not be good enough. So, as depicted in this dramatically stirring film, Martin Luther King has to mobilize his marchers in Alabama and incur horrendous beatings from the Alabama troopers, and thereby dramatize the injustice of the voting impediments that are brought to bear on black Alabamans. This elicits the nation's political attention and white sympathy. All of this culminates in the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>The British actor, David Oyelowo, seems to be the reincarnation of ML King. He looks remarkably like him, and even sounds like him, even when he's portraying King's masterful oratory. In Selma, King's tactical shrewdness is depicted to great effect. He protected the safety of his followers, to the extent he could, but he realized that the Bull Connor's (Birmingham) and Sheriff Clark's (Selma) were, in a macabre sort of way, the best arguments for the 1960s civil rights movement. I wonder how long segregation would have persisted in the south with national television.<br/><br/>There's a debate in all historically-themed films on how much scope to give to artistic / dramatic license and how much faithfulness a film should give to the historical record. I'm not a strict pedant on historical accuracy, and thus I acknowledge that films can appropriately push their dramatic momentum by slight or modest revisions in the historical record. But Selma goes too far in its unfairness to President Johnson. Sure, it makes for more dramatic tension to have an quasi-adversarial relationship between LBJ and King, but they were far more partners than adversaries. LBJ wanted a voting rights act as soon as the Democrats piled up huge Congressional majorities in the 1964 Goldwater election. Not a lot of things went right for LBJ in his 2nd term; let's at least give him some credit for working with King to get the voting rights law enacted.<br/><br/>A final delicious moment that Selma reminds me of: in the special Alabama senatorial election in December of 2017, Doug Jones defeated the noxious Roy Moore largely with the votes of black Alabamans, especially black women, who had the voting power they sorely lacked in 1965."

","The year is 1965 and every citizen in the USA still don't have voting rights. In the small community of Selma in Alabama, a woman tries to use her rights as a citizen to go and vote. She is unable to do so because according to the government of Selma, she doesn't have the right skin color. The political activist Martin Luther King Jr. hears about this and decides to do something. Selma is about the march that King initiated for voting rights for all African American people in the USA.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo plays the lead role as Martin Luther King Jr. and the supporting cast includes Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo and Oprah Winfrey. Selma has been the topic of debates all over the USA, due to its political context, its historical view but also because it was overlooked at the Oscars. David Oyelowo does an astonishing job in portraying the political leader and I do think it is a pity he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Carmen Ejogo also did a great job portraying King's wife and was in my opinion also worthy of a nomination.<br/><br/>Selma is very moving in many ways and also quite horrible from a human perspective. At one point or another, brutal scenes are mixed with a happy home environment, perhaps to say that there is happiness and hope even in all this madness. I think the weak spot of the film is the lack of focus. We get a glimpse of King's private life and the hardship he and his wife endured, but at the same time the film shows the political and the historical context of it all involving the governor, the local sheriff and the president. In the middle of it all we have the Selma march.<br/><br/>The film has also been questioned from a historical point of view because some critics feels that the portrayal of president Lyndon B. Johnson, isn't entirely correct. Personally I would have liked to see more from King's private life, and a deeper character development. I think a film more focused on the psychological aspect and not the political, would have made a greater impact.<br/><br/>Selma is still worth seeing for what the march actually did for the USA as a nation. It is always important to look back and see where we have been, before we look forward to see where we are going. The film is an important life lesson for all of us, but I think it would have been more effective if it were a more personal film. The debates around Selma have mainly been focused on its historical context instead of actually discussing human rights, and I think that's shame.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

The march is riveting as King dares to face the opposition guarding the far end of the bridge. David Oyelowe gives a powerful performance as King who believes what he preaches and stands up for what is right but suffers much to change history. Tom Wilkinson plays off the frustration of President Johnson with a touch of amusement as he walks the line between pleasing King and the American people. Thankfully he proves that his power can indeed make for a better future. Carmen Ejogo plays King's supportive yet frustrated wife who wonder how much longer this can go on. Oprah Winfrey plays an elderly woman who has weathered the physical and emotional pains of racism yet still stands strong.

This movie needs some more from behind their lines.<br/><br/>It's a mostly quiet movie and it doesn't always get the balance between sincerity and thrilling. Some of the really sincere scenes drag.

","The film is historical since it deals with a very special episode of recent modern US history: the passing of the act on the right to vote for black people, which in fact was an act banning any kind of procedure that would prevent black people from registering as citizen to vote and run in elections. That act was finally passed in 1965 under President Johnson.<br/><br/>The film explores how that act came into being. Under the pressure of a strong peaceful movement organized and led by Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, Alabama. The movement came from the local black people who had been organized by some young black people from Selma itself. Martin Luther King was only asked to come into the picture because the local people needed someone to go and speak to the President himself. And Martin Luther King had just receive the Nobel Peace Prize.<br/><br/>Johnson refused at first to deal with the voting problem of the blacks. He had more urgent business to run: his famous law on welfare and poverty and his war in Vietnam. King did not take no for an answer and he went to Selma to organize things with the locals. The reaction from the whites was superbly racist and violent. The governor, the famous Wallace, was entirely against changing traditions and he even asked the President to send troops or other forces to keep peace in the streets.<br/><br/>Johnson actually refused and Martin Luther King managed to get the attention of the national media. Then it was only a question of patience and endurance. They went to court to claim their right to peacefully demonstrate on a constitutional question like the right to vote written in black and white in the 13th and 14th amendment plus quite a few laws. The surprise came from the white judge who had to be a federal judge since it was a federal constitutional matter. The judge decided that the Blacks had the right to demonstrate to request the implementation of their federal constitutional right.<br/><br/>Then the battle was won. A massive demonstration was organized and the state of Alabama did not provoke any violence. Then within weeks the act about the matter was passed by Congress and signed by Johnson into law. This final demonstration enables the producers of the film to get history back on the screen with some of the TV coverage of the time in black and white.<br/><br/>This film is important historically, is well made and well acted. But this film is all the more important because it really starts with a bomb that kills four girls in their home. Thank you Ku Klux Klan! And the killing of a young demonstrator by a cop with his firearm. Thank you racist police and sheriff! This film was shot in 2014 and at the same moment in Ferguson, and then many other places a whole series of young male blacks were killed by police forces with their firearms or their physical brutality or lack of assistance to dying prisoners.<br/><br/>In other words in a way the film tells us history repeats itself if we do not keep up with the various issues encountered in life and make sure the solutions found now will hold later. This violence against young male blacks is typical of that necessity as much as typical of the vicious racism that is developing or that is cultivated in various local police forces in the USA, no matter what race these policemen or policewomen may be. They seem to believe that young male blacks are the inner enemy of the welfare of the nation, at least of their little patch of the nation.<br/><br/>As such, this mixture of history and present politics is a good point for a film on the subject.<br/><br/>A last thing has to be said. Martin Luther King Jr. was shown as a person who doubted a lot before coming to his decisions and actions. At times his decisions and actions were taken in some ritual way that lets us think he wanted us to believe he got in touch with God and got his advice. That attitude is surprising and yet is part of his prudence, a cautiousness that wants to be reassuring by being staged properly, that is to say with some religious dimension.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

The epic march from Selma to Montgomery took many people's life's and the political and violent struggle between the white and black communities were extremely intense. It just amazes me how much things have changed! Anyway, the performances were great, especially from David Oyelowo who plays King and the pace and great storyline was a joy to watch. Its a bit weird that an Englishman was chosen to play such an iconic American, who was fighting for American rights but he did do a great job and the film deserved the nomination for an Oscar. Its just a shame that the movie only covered a period in Martin Luther Kings life because they had the right actors and crew to make a film that would have covered the whole of his life. Anyway, the attention to detail was impressive and I liked the way that the director covered other aspects of his life, like his personal relationship with his wife and his close, trustworthy team. My mind can't comprehend how intense it must have been during that period for a black man living in Alabama, so I have to commend the real people who had to risk there life's for justice and freedom. With that in mind, you can't help feeling quite angry whilst watching this movie because of the injustice and anger that was shown towards the black community. In all, it's a well put together movie with a lot of emotional scenes and great performances. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: David Oyelowo, 39, has starred in some top movies lately, like Interstellar, Jack Reacher, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the Butler and Lincoln so the scale of this film wasn't new to him. The fact that he was playing such a huge, iconic figure, must have been a lot of pressure, especially as he is an Englishman, so I have to give him respect for pushing the project to be made. There are other top names in the cast like Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Oprah Winfrey and Giovanni Ribisi who also put in great performances and there's even a quick glimpse of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Martin Sheen, who should have been used more in my opinion. Anyway, the film was directed by Ava DuVernay who hasn't really made a big time movie of this scale before but it always helps when you have Brad Pitt and Oprah Winfrey in the production chair. This is definitely a period in history that needs to be told, especially if your an American in Alabama so with all that in mind, it's definitely one to watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $67million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic dramas about Martin Luther Kings fight for black people to vote. 7/10"

","Selma is the epic story of Martin Luther King's March from Selma Alabama to the state capital of Montgomery. and all the problems he faced along the way. The Move does not white wash the truth . Times were that bad if you were black and living in the south. This movie makes you feel what it must have been like in the 60's in the south if you were black and while accepted only by whites as inferior. You were never given a reason to rise above that. When President Johnson signed the civil rights act of 54. King accused him of not going far enough. The blacks he argued were not being treated fairly and were still denied their basic rights as citizens.In order to highlight this King planned a march from Selma to Montgomery. a march that Governor George Wallace was determined to do everything to stop including murder . It took three tries and they had to fight a war first until the nation finally saw the sad conditions down south . but Martin Luther King had a dream. And nothing can stop the power of a dream if its strong enough. not even hate can do that."

","I watched this on DVD from my public library. In 1964 and 1965, when this story takes place, I was a college student in Louisiana. Today 50 years later I don't recall anything specific about the march from Selma to the capitol about 50 miles away. But I do recall there being some racial tensions in some parts. Where I lived there were none that I was aware of. However it was accepted that blacks had separate entrances to businesses, separate rest rooms, and such things as seating in a designated section in movie houses. It was terrible discrimination but we grew up with it and didn't realize it was a wrong that needed to be righted. <br/><br/>The main issue was voting rights in the movie 'Selma'. Even though blacks were freed and slavery abolished long before, their ability to vote was being negated in Alabama because they were not allowed to freely register to vote. If you can't vote then you are not represented and the parties in power can treat you badly because they know you can't vote them out. Plus the governor of Alabama, racist George Wallace, tolerated this illegal treatment.<br/><br/>In what I consider an award-quality performance David Oyelowo becomes Dr. Martin Luther King, JR. He was a young man (in his 30s) with wisdom and a vision, and he advocated non-violent protest. He also appealed directly to the president, Lyndon Johnson of Texas, who had his hands full with the Viet Nam war. But King was persistent, finally forcing Johnson's hand when national news footage of the beatings made the whole world take note.<br/><br/>It is of historical record that Johnson then upped his priority, pushed through a voting rights act, and it was the beginning of a new era for blacks' influence, and a black (well, half black) president was elected in 2008 then reelected in 2012. We certainly would not have made such progress had King not been there to lead the effort.<br/><br/>Good movie. Hard to watch in some scenes, but a good movie."

","People were upset at the 2015 Oscars that this movie didn't get recognition in certain categories, making it seem as if the Academy was discriminating. I disagree with this disappointment as I didn't see greatness in this movie.<br/><br/>Selma was a slow movie for me, but it had a lot of allusions and historical figures to make for a good movie for history buffs. The movie had an aura of significance throughout, but it wasn't necessarily intriguing to me. The film's focus is on a short segment of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, specifically the march from Selma to Montgomery (I believe) to protest the suppression of African Americans' right to vote.<br/><br/>The film was only mediocre. Firstly, I did not think David Oyelowo played a good MLK Jr. Secondly the film seemed to rush through interactions with historical figures instead of keeping them on for the ride. When they show Malcolm X in the film he is pronounced dead only a few scenes later. J. Edgar Hoover shows up once in the film even though he is mentioned on a few occasions.<br/><br/>Nothing stood out for me regarding the overall aesthetic of the film which is why I call Selma mediocre at best. Everything seemed pretty typical - the direction, the cinematography, the editing had a slow pace to it, the acting - all fairly typical. With a boring movie I really don't have much to say, and this film bored me, but it was historically significant and still relevant to recent African American issues such as the riots in Ferguson."

","Now that the Oscars have come and gone, once can't help but mention how Selma got snubbed in both the director and actor categories. This kind of discussion turned into a debate on the systemic racism inherent to the predominantly white Academy. It's not that I disagree with those opinions. It's just that I think it's important to remember that the same academy awarded Steve McQueen with Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave last year and gave Mexican director I√±√°rritu three(!) Oscars for Birdman this year which ensured that Linklater's very 'American' tale of growing up (Boyhood) went home mostly empty-handed. That's all I'm sayin'¬Ö <br/><br/>Anyway, let's discuss the film. Needless to say, it's about Martin Luther King Jr.'s march from the eponymous city to Montgomery as a way of protesting against the violations of African Americans' right to vote; although they are technically allowed to vote, the institutionalized racism in many of the Southern states makes it impossible for them to do so, as the opening scene adequately shows. A black woman, Annie Lee Cooper, enters the voting office, only to find herself confronted with a racist behind the counter, asking her to cite the Preamble to the Constitution. She succeeds after which she's asked to answer how many judges there are in Alabama. Again she answers correctly, but when she's asked to name each and every one, she fails and her request form is stamped with a big, red 'DENIED'. It's a great way of showing how racism and discrimination aren't simply rooted out by way of a law or two. Otherwise, African Americans would've been truly free during Lincoln's time. No, the fight against racism is a long and arduous one that lasts for generations if not centuries. <br/><br/>It is during these troubling times that Dr. King decides, together with his trusted circle of friends and advisors, to stage a march in Selma. As preparations are made, tragedies continue to pile up. We get a glimpse into the racist mindsets of the southern states; the way the constant 'haze of death' looms upon Dr. King and his household, much to his wife's chagrin; Dr. King's negotiations with President Lyndon Johnson, etc.<br/><br/>I've read complaints regarding historical accuracy here and there: for instance, that it was wrong to suggest President Johnson instructed the FBI to keep tabs on Dr. King. As to whether there is truth in this, I personally don't know. What I do know is that the first and foremost task of a biopic isn't to follow history to the letter, but to make history come alive. In this, Selma succeeds and it particularly shows during Dr. King's speeches. Actor David Oyelowo gives a transcendent performance. It's impossible not to be moved and enraptured by the passion on display. Though I will never know what it must've been like to experience Dr. king's speeches, Selma gives me a pretty damn good idea. In spite of how you may feel about the film's historical accuracy, it's undeniable that (especially during the speeches) the film makes history come alive. <br/><br/>There're only two things that nagged at me: the presence of too many familiar faces and the misuse of slow-motion. Sometimes, an all-star cast is great, but some stories don't lend themselves well to that approach and a film about MLK is one of them. This is the type of film that requires great, but not overly familiar, actors, otherwise it turns the whole thing into a who's who. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be immersed into MLK's struggle than being like 'hey, that's Martin Sheen' or 'hey, that's Oprah Winfrey'. It automatically pulls you out of the experience. 12 Years a Slave suffered from a similar problem: too many familiar faces = 'oh yeah, it's only a movie' and that defeats the whole purpose. <br/><br/>As for the slow-motion, all I can say is that director DuVernay loves herself some slo-mo. Don't get me wrong, I like slo-mo, but you have to use it very carefully, because it's basically a cinematic trick that defies realism. The film usually employs this tactic during scenes of violence, when the police are beating down African Americans on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, or when a young black man is shot to death in a restaurant, etc. What I think is jarring is that slo-mo seems to raise violence to art in a way. The slo-mo effect allows you to take in what is happening in all its gory glory. But paradoxically, by slowing the action down, it also robs the violence of its effect. If memory serves, something similar happened during the Rodney King trial, where the defendants' lawyer repeated the infamous video footage so many times that the effect wore off on the jury. Selma's use of slo-mo has the same effect: not only does it pull you out of the film, but it paradoxically reduces the impact of the violence on display. <br/><br/>Other than that, Selma is gripping cinema. The film's quite understated in its portrayal of MLK. DuVernay has also made the tasteful choice of not ending the film with MLK's murder, instead ending with a speech in Montgomery with text overlays explaining the fates of those involved. It's highly appropriate for the film to end with a speech and not the murder, because his speech symbolizes equal rights, whereas his murder symbolizes racism. MLK's struggle was bigger than him. It's not so much about his life as his commitment and dedication to secure equal rights. As such, showing his murder would've been the sensational, but not the wise thing to do. Instead, the film ends with a message of positivity and hope for the future. Hallelujah, indeed."

","Selma does not concentrate on the story of Dr Martin Luther King but does focus on the fight to secure equal voting rights with an epic march from the town of Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.<br/><br/>British actor David Oyelowo steps up to the mark with a masterful portrayal of MLK and is matched by Carmen Ejogo as his wife. Two other British actors Tim Roth play Governor Wallace and Tom Wilkinson as Lyndon B Johnson.<br/><br/>The film takes a tough and gritty look at the civil rights era. An era that does not deserve to be sugar coated. Some of the people who stood up to be counted were killed including King and its easy to forget some 50 years later that rights were not given but had to be fought for and some paid a heavy price.<br/><br/>The film makes good use of archive footage and is enthralling although some scenes might had just be a tad overlong with a few cheesy lines. There are a few star cameos and the film has a strong drive that does bot feel too preachy."
"rubenm","7","0","0","21 March 2015"," Impressive history lesson
","If there's one thing Americans are really good at, it's making films about their own history. There are countless interesting films about important periods in the history of the US. This thought crossed my mind, because in 'Selma' we see both Malcolm X and J. Edgar Hoover, about whom excellent films have been made in the past, enabling me to put everything in the right context. To have the history of your country documented with excellent films, is a great thing. <br/><br/>'Selma' is an outstanding contribution to this tradition. It documents an important period in the civil rights movement: the march from Selma to Montgomery, a protest march to obtain legally sound voting rights for the black population in Alabama. It concentrates on a rather short period in the life of Martin Luther King, and doesn't include too many side-stories. That's a wise choice: the viewer doesn't get the chance to lose attention or to be distracted. The screenplay intelligently switches between the goings-on in Alabama, where the black population stands up against the suppression by white racists, and Washington, where King puts pressure on president Lyndon B. Johnson to start the necessary political process. <br/><br/>David Oyelowo is impressive as Martin Luther King. He convincingly shows all aspects of King's personality: the preacher, who is able to inspire crowds with his speeches; the politician, who knows how to play power games if necessary, and the husband, who realizes he has disappointed the woman he loves. By the way: a peculiar detail is that four major parts are played by British actors: King, his wife, president Johnson and governor Wallace."

","If you haven't heard of African American filmmaker Ava DuVernay it might surprise you how long she's been involved with the industry and the extensiveness of her education. She received a BA from the University of California, majoring in English and African American studies, before working as a journalist and a film publicist. The latter paved her way into the film industry as a director. DuVernay has made three films prior to Selma: the documentary This Is the Life and the features I Will Follow (2010) and Middle of Nowhere (2012). For Middle of Nowhere, she became the first African-American woman to win Best Director at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012. DuVernay is also an advocate for distributing independent African American films. She formed the African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement, designed to broaden the distribution of black cinema. With Selma, she was aided by Oprah Winfrey, who produced the film through her production company Harpo Films, along with another heavyweight in Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>Selma stars David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King, Jr. and is about his efforts in 1965 to organise the three Selma to Montgomery marches. The walks across the 54-mile highway, between Selma and Montgomery, were a display of resistance against segregation in conservative places like Alabama. They were also imperative during the Civil Rights Movement for employing the Voting Rights Act, a pivotal piece of legislation preventing discrimination against African Americans registering to vote. The film is a period piece but also an acute mirror of the racial tensions experienced between minorities and White Americans in cities like Ferguson today. The juxtaposition of timelines is referenced in the lyrics of the John Legend song ""Glory"" played over the end credits: ""That's why Rosa sat on the bus. That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up."" Similarly, the violent, barbaric response of the riot police in the film pitches visual and historical parallels between the past and present, underlining the lack of progression in social attitudes. <br/><br/>David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King, Jr. as tired and worn from the toll the activism has taken on himself and the other protesters. In the opening scene he and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) stand together in a mid shot outlining their plans for their lives, promises tinged with doubt knowing their lives will drastically change. The contrasting scenes spur the marches: the bombing of a church which kills four young girls and Annie Lee Cooper (subtly played by Oprah Winfrey), who is turned down to vote because she can't recite the names of all sixty-seven judges in Alabama. King's method is ""negotiate, demonstrate and resist"", a formula for passivism and non-violent protests against White bigots. His plan is to wait for the police to make a mistake, such as overreacting, which is published in the newspapers or on television. The film shares similar thematic goals as Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave. Both films consider the price of individualism and passivity and how long an individual can stand wayside while others are punished for protesting their freedom and liberty. King and his supporters are martyrs, prepared to die for their cause. Voting and Democracy is an imperative step in completing their religious destiny of having full control and choice over their own lives, independent of Whites. By framing King in a Church with a cross behind him, Ava views him with a religious gaze, a Christ figure of moral and social progression.<br/><br/>However, the film does not stray from showing the personal costs of passivism. In one strong moment of conflict between King and Coretta, she expresses her discontent with what she describes as ""a fog of death"" swarming over them and the constant separation between herself and her husband due to his political work. They are creepily tormented by disruptive phone calls and death threats. In one scene they're not framed together like in the opening but cut separately, positioned away from each other to visualise their conflict. One falsehood is the film's depiction of King's relationship with President Johnson (played by Tom Wilkinson). They're represented as being in a stalemate over the protests and Johnson's refusal to act on passing the voting law. Meanwhile Johnson's also conspiring with J. Edgar Hoover to deter King through intimidation tactics. This depiction of King's opponent has rightly come under fire from critics because it's openly documented Johnson was King's ally and encouraged the protests to gather attention. <br/><br/>The inaccuracies don't hamper the authenticity of the performances though. David Oyelowo, who featured briefly in Interstellar last year, gives a star-making performance as King. The breadth of his work is most impressive. His towering presence when he addresses people with his speeches is breathtaking in conviction and power and the quieter, more subtle moments of the film allow him to express his weariness and doubts through his eyes and facial movements. His physical attributes are beneficial too given he looks like King and captures both his baritone voice and lyrical speech patterns. His dominant impression was unlucky not to snare an Oscar nomination. Other actors also impress, including British actress Carmen Ejogo as his wife who wholeheartedly dramatises her frustrations with their relationship, which heightens the personal conflict and refuses to sanitise King's image. It's a distracting having well-known Englishmen like Tim Roth and Tom Wilkinson playing American political figures but both add personality to their roles. It's largely a solid, confidentially made film, buoyed by very good performances. Its timeliness is at once remarkable and scary as overt racial tensions of contemporary America again come to fruition. While it takes sizable liberties with history to move us, it is at times genuinely stirring."

","No, this doesn't seem right: words of doubt are the first we hear in this film centering on the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader if the United States civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s Martin Luther King. Dies it refer to his Nobel acceptance speech, the festive tie, or his public role? Selma starts long after King talked about his dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the night of King's greatest honor, the Oslo Nobel ceremony. A global hero, an admired fighter for justice and equality, a deeply hated figure amongst those who feared and opposed change. The film accompanies King through the battle for voting rights in the Alabama town of Selma right to President Johnson announcing the Voting Rights Act in 1965.Selma focuses on the events of those months and on the people at their center, first and foremost King himself. British actor David Oyelowo plays King as a determined leader, a charismatic speaker and a doubting and quite flawed human. As the hero King moves to the shadows, the man emerges.<br/><br/>It is Selma's great strength that it eschews all the temptations of the biopic genre, that it avoids the spectacular but is content with shedding a glimpse of a pivotal moment in recent American history. It moves into back rooms, kitchens, King's home, churches turned into makeshift meeting rooms. The public stance ‚Äì the standoff in front of the Selma courthouse, the three marches to Montgomery, King's speeches ‚Äì provide the narrative frame and are filmed in a haunting way, especially the first march's violent suppression that director Ava DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young depict in slow motion, accentuating the brutality as well the suffering of the brave marchers while giving the whole scene the nightmarish quality of an event that defies understanding. It is in scenes like this that the viewer realizes why these men and women do what they do, why they really have no choice. The doubts come in the more intimate moments: King's conversations with his wife, the seemingly endless debates with other leaders, an attempt as resignation diverted in a long and calmly narrated car ride.<br/><br/>Here, King is a man full of fear and doubt, who calls singer Mahalia Jackson in the middle of the night to hear her soothing voice, who often wonders if the price isn't too high, if he isn't hurting his family too much, if his public struggle might not do more harm than good. A man, too, who likes a laugh and who has not been entirely faithful to his wife, a man not completely immune to fame and admiration. But also a stubborn fighter who stands up to President Johnson, played memorably by another British actor, Tom Wilkinson. It is true that Johnson's portrayal is a little more negative than history warrants but the film needs him as a well-enough meaning but pragmatic antagonist far removed from the plain racism of people like Alabama governor George Wallace. Another troubled man, beset by various pressures, trying to do the right thing but more than once lost in a tangle he can hardly see through. In the end, Johnson comes around and King triumphs but it is a triumph that is only the beginning of new fights ‚Äì for both men.<br/><br/>Young's camera often moves King off center, slightly to the left or right, symbolizing a man far less certain than his public persona. A golden light drenches most scenes, not romanticizing, suggesting a different time, the treacherous marshlands of memory, while the camera brings these people close to us with their struggle that is far from over today. a struggle fought as much in dark rooms and conflicting, doubtful minds as on the street. What Selma most succeeds in is to take the events of 1965 out of the history books and return them to the people behind them. It depicts the legends as humans, struggling with all kinds of everyday human conditions, fear, doubt, indecisiveness, anger. It depots King and his allies as humans fighting a human fight that is heroic entirely in it being completely ordinary, at least for those involved. Change starts with the ""ordinary"" who come to a point when they feel like they have no choice but to act. When, in the end, Selma uses original footage of the third march, Ferguson (which is alluded to in the film's Oscar-winning flagship song ""Glory"") seems closer than ever. Selma could not be any more contemporary than it is.<br/><br/>www.stagescreen.de"

","'Selma' is a good movie about a great human being. I'll admit I didn't know much about the actual events, so the movie was quite interesting. The movie focuses on a pivotal moment during the Civil Rights Movement, which focuses on Martin Luther King Jr. trying to march through Selma to Montgomery. Selma is told with with a solid amount of emotion, the events the movie portrays really gets your blood boiling because of how arrogant and hateful people could be back then. This is a powerful movie about a powerful individual who united thousands of people for one great cause and the movie itself truly captures the spirit of Dr King very well. The acting is of course phenomenal, some of the best of the year, especially when you hear David O's natural voice!<br/><br/>But what really held 'Selma' back was the whole LBJ storyline and how they made him out as more of a bad buy more than anything else. After the movie I went and read about the events and a lot of other people out there agree (or were upset) about how the directed made him look. He was actually the one who gave MLK the idea to go to Selma and protest there, not Dr King. He also was a very strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement and was constantly (but secretly) working on solving the situation on a legislative level. So if you are looking for a more factual movie about the events that took place, look for a documentary rather than this. Don't get me wrong, this is an eye opening movie, but it does have it's weaknesses, particularly the portrayal of LBJ and Dr King's personal life storyline, which is quite brief and doesn't really add much to the story. Outside of those complaints, the movie sends a very strong message and a great one at that. <br/><br/>Is this movie the Best Picture of the year? No, it's a good movie with a heart at the center of the story, but it lacks to energy and gut punching ability that '12 Years a Slave' had last year to make it truly something special."
"DeanBenedetti","8","3","8","16 January 2015"," Ava DuVernay's Excellent Portrait of MLK, The Man
","It really is amazing that Selma is the very first theatrical biopic of one of the most important and famous figures in American history. Seems to me that Hollywood should have cranked out at least ten mediocre, Oscar-bait films by now...but I'm glad they waited. Selma is the silver screen debut that MLK deserved. <br/><br/>The story begins right as he receives his Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, which is thoughtfully cut with the 16th street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. From the get-go, the audience sees just how far African Americans have come and just how far they have left to go. From there, the focus turns to African American voting rights, and how although it is technically legal for them to vote, the strong prejudice against them in the south has made voting nearly impossible. MLK visits the White House to plea with LBJ, who essentially puts the issue on the back burner to concentrate on his 'War on Poverty' initiative. MLK then starts organizing black (and eventually white) protesters to march from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol of Montgomery. Despite the brutal opposition of Alabama governor George Wallace and his posse of racist troopers/policeman, and despite a direct order from the president of the United States, MLK took to the streets with hundreds of marchers for the greater good. What immediately separates Selma from most other biopics is an almost complete lack of sentimentality. MLK is shown as a living, breathing man, one with marital issues, one who isn't perfect. There are no cloying tidbits to tug at the viewer's heart strings, just a sober, honest depiction of the facts. One aspect that really shocked me was how the screenwriter decided to portray President Johnson. At one point, he actually says, ""Are you trying to *beep* over the president?"" Again, these are the words of a flawed man, not something out of a high school text book. Johnson, despite being wrong, wasn't exactly depicted as a racist monster, just a powerful white man who was wary of change. Bold choice for Paul Webb. Regardless of how realistic and powerful the script is, Selma still has some of the typical failings of any film chronicling history. Among MLK's group of black protesters, Martin is the only character who receives any characterization whatsoever. His inside crew is merely a poorly defined group of black faces, most of whom are only mentioned by name maybe once or twice. Also, some of the drama with Martin's wife, Coretta Scott King, could have been made more compelling. There were just one too many quiet scenes of domestic discomfort. <br/><br/>Ava DuVernay, whose only other films are a couple of low-key dramas, explodes into the big-leagues with a beautifully shot-and-edited period piece. Characterized by dark interiors, fresh angles, loads of brilliant tracking shots, and absorbing slow-motion, Selma is an uncharacteristically artistic biopic, one that isn't afraid of being creative with such sacred material. The score and soundtrack are pretty underwhelming for the most part, except for a few powerful musical choices during the more violent sequences. <br/><br/>David Oyelowo is unbelievable as Martin Luther King. He looks just like him, he speaks just like him, and his screen presence is undeniably powerful. His is possibly my favorite lead male performance of the year, Academy be damned. The only other actor who comes close to his level is Tom Wilkinson as LBJ. Other notable actors include Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr., Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Root, and Dylan Baker. <br/><br/>Selma, for better or worse, is probably the best MLK movie that will ever be made. I've never really liked the biopic genre because of its sanitization and lack of courage (see this year's bizarrely overrated The Theory of Everything), but Selma almost always comes off as honest and respectful. It's a film I hold in high regard, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again."

",". . . and may have merited a rating of ""10"" instead of an ""8"" if it had been just a little more shrill and strident about this (at least in the final updates section at the end, as opposed to generally lulling younger audience members to sleep throughout its low-key 128-minute running time). SELMA shows future U.S. Congressman John Lewis being billy-clubbed by Alabama state troopers. If the Conferate States are assessed a measly $10,000 for each illegal and racist cop club stroke from 1865 through 1965, you're up to trillions in long overdue payments there alone. SELMA pictures four young church girls being blown up in a bombing egged on by a Confederate State government. At just $1 million per life illegally lost at the governments' behest from 1865 through 1965, that's many more trillions. SELMA portrays a white Boston priest kicked to death with the blessing of Alabama Governor George Wallace, and when you add in white Detroit marcher Viola Liuzzo (gunned down on the final day of the March) and the 300,000 white Blue Staters slaughtered for Black Rights in the Civil War, that's many more trillions delinquent (the lack of which caused Detroit's bankruptcy, and a sea of red ink in the other Blue States). Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia must make a start toward lagging reimbursements by immediately sending three-fifths (60%) of ALL their local and state tax revenue to the Blue States (to use as America's protectors see fit). Similarly, three-fifths of the Confederate Congressional seats MUST be reapportioned (along with one U.S. Senate seat per Rebel State) to the American Values Guardian States, Confederate-born U.S. Supreme Court justices MUST be ousted, and three-fifths of ALL U.S. military personnel (plus ALL government vendor factories and nuclear weapons) MUST be relocated to Blue States. SELMA illustrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same. The existing U.S. Supreme Court recently nullified the 1965 Voting Rights Act (which was the whole point of the SELMA marches), and there were news stories this week that Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King's children are so desperate that they have to sell off his Nobel Peace Prize and Bible. So, what do we want? As SELMA preaches, change! When do we want it? NOW!"

","Once at school I ran for student government as a joke. For my own entertainment. I had a speech prepared that said I needed 80% of everyone's annual income to host a Metallica concert and a whole lot of other crazy bullshit. I got a special talking to by the principal about the content of my speech and was given 5 minutes to make a new one. So, I delivered over the PA system one of the worst speeches of all time. A freshman dude later said to me, ""everyone voted for you because your speech was ass."" I love the word ""ass"" when it's used as an adjective. So, despite all Selma's amazing speeches from one of America's best public speakers, the movie was ass. Adjective form of ass.<br/><br/>Let's start with Dr. King. He's a perfect character. Irrational behavior makes stories. Martin is a true gentleman and Christian throughout, as he should be. But is that interesting at all to watch? No. I didn't feel for him. The only mistake Dr. King makes is cheating on his wife and when she finds out, he does the right thing and owns up to what he did. Martin doesn't do much. He mostly watches other people being bludgeoned and has discussions with the president where he makes good points in a respectful way. It was a banal portrayal of an interesting man who did interesting things.<br/><br/>Selma was decently acted and I enjoyed the directing. The use of authentic southern black music was great. The sequence with the initial march across the bridge and mass beating used the music well, as if to say, ""we can still make it, you guys."" The movie had a very hopeful message. But hey, we see great acting and directing in movies all the time. It was here for the duration of Selma, but that didn't save the movie from the mass organized crapfest that it turned out to be. If I walk into a movie NOT planning to make fun of it, the screenwriter has the job of making damn sure that I don't make fun of it. At the end, the movie claims that ""there isn't a black problem or white problem, but an American problem."" They show people of all races working together. Yet, the cops giving the beat-downs don't have their faces shown, a technique to dehumanize. It's a movie about how people can mistreat people, but after loving people regardless of race, there's no love left for people who don't love you back. So why see the violent cops as inhuman? It doesn't help with the themes of acceptance. The real MLK said to judge people on the content of their character, not race. However, the black characters who want to murder and fight are only not able. Aside from this, there aren't any real flaws in the directing.<br/><br/>Selma is a well-acted movie about violent racism (those ballsy sons of bitches talking about race in such a biased country), but I stopped caring half way through. For all the white people beating black people, there isn't much opposition for Dr. King in the second half, making things fade away from conflict where they should be getting more intense. In the end, Martin is given everything he was trying for in a flowery gift basket. There's no real climax, it's just, ""hey, Marty, you've been chill, so here's some success.""<br/><br/>My being stupid in going for student government is what made it entertaining for me and everyone else who witnessed it. All Selma's civil rights activists act properly throughout. The one character who suggests shooting the cops is talked down by his rational colleague to ensure that I didn't see a someone associated with King mess up. Not being entertaining is the most grievous sin that can sexually violate the virgin body of a story. Selma's screenplay is going to be murdered in prison for this and sent to the burning seventh circle of Hell for its violence against art. It was non-engaging, uninteresting ass."

","The movie Selma attempts to capture a pivotal moment of the Civil Rights movement and the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The events that led up to and followed the crossing of the Edmund Petus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. This movie was filmed in Georgia, so it was neat to see some Georgia landmarks that were the backdrop of Alabama in the 1960s. A wide and diverse cast that captured a perspective of that era. Regardless of all the historic criticism of the film, it at least is introducing this story to a new generation of Americans. Very timely with all the race relation issues that our nation face today. A struggle that continues today."
"texshelters","7","2","6","19 January 2015"," Good acting, uneven directing, a decent script and a quality film score make for a compelling drama.
","The directing for Selma was pedestrian but not terrible for a first-timer. The camera work offers no surprises nor innovations and there is nothing about the blocking of scenes, whether in churches, on the streets or on the bridge, that enhances the action and drama. The upshot is that Selma is mainly by the books directing but over use of camera gimmickry didn't distract us from the story. It's average and adequate, not terrible, directing. <br/><br/>Give credit to the writers and director for showing the flaws and foibles as well as the successes and brilliance of Dr. King in his entirety. No man is perfect, and to portray him as such would have been a discredit to his legacy. Not only are his oft presented infidelities touched upon, but his doubts about his abilities and his leadership mistakes are also part of the film. What makes King and so many leaders in the film remarkable is that they overcame their imperfections to do great things. <br/><br/>David Oyelowo put in an Oscar worthy performance as Dr. King but failed to get a nomination. His character wasn't mentally or physically challenged, and let's face, not White. Yes, and his name isn't Denzel Washington. But if you play a White man who admits to killing dozens of people, that earns you an Oscar nod. I haven't seen ""Sniper"", and I am sure Mr. Cooper is great. However, this is an unfortunate slight given the difficulty of playing the historical legend and the quality of the performance. <br/><br/>One of my favorite actresses from last year, Tessa Thompson of ""Dear White People"", plays the firebrand radical Diane Nash. She doesn't get nearly enough screen time for me. However, she probably got the time her character warranted for the story. Actors playing Andrew Young (Andre Holland) and John Lewis (Stephen James) are also excellent. Nigel Thatch in a brief appearance plays Malcolm X perfectly. And the always entertaining Tim Roth plays to his strength of portraying deranged men, this time, Gov. Wallace. <br/><br/>One unfortunate choice was putting a rap song at the end of the movie when there are so many period songs or spirituals that would be more appropriate. I assume it was part of the deal to fund the film and get Common on board as one of the actors. ""Glory"" is a good song, and Legend is a great singer. And if it got the movie produced, fine. It is, however, out of place. <br/><br/>As for the controversy about LBJ: Tom Wilkinson does a good job portraying the conflicted president. From what I know about Johnson, the portrait was fair and accurate. Carmen Ejogo played Coretta King with the dignity required, though her role suffered from inattentive writing and wasn't well flushed out. <br/><br/>Rating: Pay Full Matin√©e Price<br/><br/>Selma is entertaining though too long in moments. Tighter editing would have helped with the pacing. A bigger budget may have given the director more opportunities to be creative with the shots. The angles, lighting and pacing didn't match the gravity of the story. The dialogue worked well for the time and place of the movie. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","2","16 January 2018"," ""Selma"" explores the strategy of the Civil Rights movement and its mastermind
","No 20th century figure looms as large as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and no film could possibly encapsulate who he was and what he did over the course of his short but powerful lifetime. But in ""Selma,"" director Ava DuVernay and writer Paul Webb find an ideal window of time through which to explore King's influence and not as a dreamer, but as a strategist. <br/><br/>The film examines the chess moves that took place leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a critical piece of legislation that removed many of the barriers keeping African-Americans away from the voting booth. In early 1965, King (David Oyelowo) arrives in Selma after being unable to convince President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) of making swift changes to protect the black right to vote. Knowing the only way he can make change is to double dow on peaceful protest and make more headlines in the news, he begins planning with members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and ultimately challenges Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth), risking lives in order to get the federal government to act.<br/><br/>Emotion layers every part of ""Selma,"" but Webb's script has a definitive focus on tactics and explores the political maneuvering behind affecting actual change. Today, we regard the Civil Rights Movement and King's methods as one of the most effective efforts to enact social and political change and ""Selma"" shows just how calculated - not impulsive - those methods were.<br/><br/>At the same time, the film suggests King was riddled with doubt. The man we know to be resolute if not stubborn in his will was keenly aware of the consequences for his fellow man. Oyelowo's best work as King comes in emulating his incredible oratory skills rather than the behind-the-scenes moments, but he's compelling nonetheless and captures both the strong leadership and humanity of this legendary figure.<br/><br/>Still, the film operates best when it explores King as strategist and the dynamics on both sides of the board trying to plot their next move. The little character moments with King and, for example, his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) don't hold as much weight or attention. On the other hand, the way King interacts with others in the movement, like the father of a young protester killed by Selma police, show King's pastoral nature and bring deep humanity to the story. Those moments, when human consequences converge with the top view of change-making are when ""Selma"" shines most. The film just needs more of them. <br/><br/>DuVernay also seems like a director best suited with that kind of material. The actors carry the brunt of conveying all the dialogue-heavy gamesmanship scenes for her, but she does best with moments like in the beginning when Oprah's Annie Cooper goes to the courthouse and tries registering to vote. That scene is a mere microcosm of what's discussed in the film, but it stands out because we can relate to it and feel for the character. <br/><br/>The analytical side and the emotional side of ""Selma"" seem a bit at odds with each other through most of the film, but when they come together, they make for the kind of cinematic moments you want from a prestige picture like this. ""Selma"" is also pretty good when one side clearly overtakes the other, but admittedly it makes for a less cohesive finished product. Nevertheless, the film honors the pivotal piece of history it portrays and the key figure at its center. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

","Selma starts off like a bio pic...before finally finding its groove in the little moments: a a diner, coroner's waiting area, a car ride. The movie captures just how many lives and conversations it took to create change. There are parts of the storytelling that are familiar (almost cliche), but the overall impact is powerful. It's a civil rights story told from the people that were oppressed and rose up."

Yes there really powerful in many ways. <br/><br/>However we have seen these emotional scenes before and for a Oscar caliber movie it didn't bring anything new in the way 12 Years a Slave did. it kinda just felt like the Oscars wanted a 'black lead' film to be in the running so they said....Selma.. there happy. <br/><br/>But I am not happy and really don't think this is a Oscar caliber film at all. <br/><br/>I never got into the actor playing MLK. David Oyelwow just didn't capture me. I also think Ava needs more time to become a better director and don't get some first time writer in the chair as well, because it did not go all that great as far the story was concerned. <br/><br/>There are just other movies that do Martin more justice<br/><br/>-Our friend, Martin - Bringing King to China<br/><br/>This film also had many chances to go deeper and darker with Martin Luther King, but instead it runs away and tries to play it all safe. <br/><br/>Overall there is some good here, and if this is your kids first look at Martin Luther King then hey let him watch it, but I have seen too many Martin Luther King documentaries and movies and this just doesn't do it for me."
"davideo-2","9","1","2","28 October 2015"," Probably not the epic it would have been twenty years ago, but still a lot to admire
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the 1960s, Professor Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) is in the thrust of his epic civil rights battle, which has come to the attention of President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson.) Johnson tries to assist King with some platitudes and assistance, but King believes the next major step forward is securing equal voting rights for him and his people. In the face of relentless violence and intimidation, from both sides of the law, King presses on regardless, with an epic march from Selma to Alabama.<br/><br/>It seems to be the in thing these days, when making a film about an important historical figure, to focus on one particular event in their lives, rather than to make an all out epic dramatisation of their life story, like they would have twenty years ago, when the likes of Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard would have turned it into a three hour yarn of the sort I remember from my youth. For someone who remembers these types of films so vividly, this more condensed approach is a little hard to adjust to, but by zooming in on one important event in Kings life, Ava DuVarney has made a piece of art all the same.<br/><br/>I always imagined who would portray King if ever a film was made about him, and it seems the honours have fallen to British actor David Oyelowo. Given the endless list of Hollywood candidates available, this is an achievement in and of itself, but that he nails it on the head so perfectly is something even better. Oyelowo captures King's speech, delivery, fluidity, mannerisms and general presence perfectly, and fits the role physically too. Given he's carrying the film, and his is the role it all centres on, this is a great thing, but it's not as if fine support from the likes of Wilkinson and Tim Roth don't help.<br/><br/>It seems the honours have fallen on me to do the 200th review of this film, and given how well everything was pulled off, this is no poor honour. ****"
"mwalz06","7","1","2","15 April 2015"," Selma is a historical movie on the Civil Rights movement in the town of Selma.
","Selma is an amazing and enlightening movie on the the Civil Rights movement during the late nineteen hundreds. It shows the effect of Martin Luther King's Civil Rights demonstrations and it shows the viewer how hard the residents in Selma fought for their civil rights. Even through great opposition, the followers of Marin Luther King continued to fight for there rights. Even though I found this movie to sometimes be a little confusing and slow, I recommend it to those who enjoy history. This Civil Rights movie is mainly historically accurate and supplies the viewer with a better understanding of the demonstrations done in Selma. Including the famous march from Selma to Montgomery. I believe that this movie was well made and it displays the fight for suffrage in Selma, Alabama accurately. I hope this helps and enjoy the movie."
"t-metcalfe10","8","1","2","11 April 2015"," Great Historical Movie
","Overall, I liked Selma very much. The best part of the movie in my opinion was how the story flowed from one scene to the next. The film had great acting, and the transitions were quick, which alleviated some of the problems that plague other historical movies, namely boringness. Unlike other historical movies, Selma did a great job of explaining everything that was going on, which is good for the casual movie watcher. Other movies of this genre tend to not explain the plot as much, which somewhat tailors them specifically for history buffs.<br/><br/>One other thing that the movie does well is deal with the violent aspect of the civil rights movement. Selma shows the brutality that must be shown in any film about civil rights, but does a nice job of staying away from excessive blood and gore, which can turn some people away. <br/><br/>The one aspect of Selma that was bad was its fictionalization and some historical inaccuracies, which is the only thing that prevented it from having a higher score. <br/><br/>Final Score: 8/10"
"meaganarguiencc","7","1","2","6 April 2015"," Emotionally gripping film that held my attention
","This historical film, clearly aided in demonstrating the feelings of fear, suspense, and uncertainty that were evident through the Civil Rights Movement. As multiple characters associated with each other, the feelings among characters became evident. These feelings played an ever increasing role in the film as families were broken up and friendships were lost. It was these dramatic events though, that led to an increasing feeling of despair, until a remarkable moment of triumph was witnessed. I found that David Oyelowo, the actor playing Martian Luther King Jr., was extremely powerful with his words, drawing me into the screen, and enabling me to envision that I was there in the moment. One thing that I found interesting, and frankly unbelievable, was that after multiple incidents with police and angry white men, Annie Lee Cooper, played by Oprah Winfrey, was still alive. However, this, in addition to a false relationship between Johnson and King (President Johnson supported the Civil Rights Movement more than was made evident in the film), was the only inaccuracy that I could clearly identify. Overall, the film was very well done. I would definitely categorize this film as an inspirational, yet historical, film. This is definitely a film that would inspire one to try to make a difference in the world. Happy viewing!"
"jacobperkinscc16","Null","1","2","5 April 2015"," Review of Selma
","Selma was a quality movie that helped the viewer sympathize and visualize the struggle of African Americans for civil rights. The severity of the brutality of racist southern whites and police on the African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement was shocking and appalling, especially when it was directed towards innocent children. Displaying the fact that children were ruthlessly killed in their own church by a bomb and that elderly men would be beaten by the police for peaceful protest in a vivid way creates a new understanding of the abuses that could not be given with mere words. The film illustrated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and struggle with trying to lead the movement and instilled a greater sense of respect for him in viewers. The fact that he pushed on in the movement despite the tension it created in his family, Lyndon B. Johnson's lack of cooperation, and the threat of death for him and his family is remarkable. The movie clearly showed that the Christian faith of most of the activists was a driving force in the movement. Many activists were clergymen especially those whites who traveled to Selma to aid King on his March to Washington. Selma is a great movie that reveals many aspects of the Civil Rights Movement that are not commonly known and heightened the understanding of those that are."
"Cakepugsart","8","1","2","2 April 2015"," Powerful and eyeopening story!
","The Civil Rights Movement is truly inspiring, and a well known leader of that movement was Martin Luther King Jr. In the movie Selma, King is portrayed more powerful than ever. This movie not only retold his story, but it showed us things we didn't originally know about him. He overcame so much during his life, and his wife Coretta gave up so much in her life to help and support his dream for the movement. It is really sad to see how society during this movement acted towards African Americans, Selma does an excellent job showing this. During the march from Selma to Montgomery, marchers were beat by state troopers, whipped, trampled and left in the street that way. Many had broken bones, bruises and blood all over themselves. The saddest part of all of it is that white people living in the town gathered and cheered on the troopers, yelled racist comments at the marchers, it was like a fun event for them to watch and enjoy. I knew these atrocities existed back then, but seeing them in action, watching how it effected the marchers was really eyeopening. These people really had such strong feelings of hate towards one race and its hard to understand how they could stand there and watch the people be beaten, how could they feel it was OK. It is so inspiring to see the marchers and Dr. King, with other leaders, continuously fight for their right even as they are physically and mentally tormented, and brought down. This movie was really inspiring and powerful, it taught me so much about the past, it is a must see for all ages."
"jennyyaucc16","7","1","2","1 April 2015"," More Than Just Martin Luther King Jr.
","The film showed all the causes and events surrounding the march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. The term civil rights seems to raise a direct relation to Martin Luther King. However, the movement was not ran by one single African American, it was the entire black community and the movie did a great job showing the combined efforts of everyone that worked toward gaining their rights as American citizens. The grassroots support from the poorest to the white priest from the north showed the influence of the movement. During the movie, there were three attempts of the march and each time the amount of people grew and the participants diversified, showing the impact the event had as it progressed. The movie also displayed how essential nonviolence and public support is to a movement. If violent protesting was employed, the public would not have supported the march and the blacks would not have received what they were fighting for and would continued to be deprived of their rights.<br/><br/>One extremely powerful scene from the movie was when chaos and violence broke out during the first march. It was distressing to see state troopers, people citizens are suppose to trust, heartlessly beating the poor marchers. It was a compelling moment that showed how deep-rooted the south was in discrimination against African Americans. No wonder that even though the fight for civil rights have been around since the Reconstruction Era but didn't achieve its goals until the late 1960s. Another interesting part of that scene was the white reporter, Roy Reed, who was there the entire time to tell America the horrors that were occurring in Selma, Alabama. For the entire movie up to that point, it seemed as if there were no nice white citizens around Alabama and it was kind of soothing to finally see some humanity. Although Selma has several inaccuracies, it is still a great movie that people should watch if they want a screen portrayal of the civil rights movement in the 1960s."
"bkoganbing","10","1","2","28 March 2015"," Where we make our stand?
","In any campaign good intelligence is always invaluable. My favorite scene in Selma is when Martin Luther King played by David Oyelowo is talking to the local activists in Selma. He tells a story of an action tried at a Georgia town where the sheriff might have been a redneck, but he was a smart redneck. He took the peaceful protesters away by stretcher without a single nightstick raised. No footage of brutality for the media to expose. So King asks the question, is Sheriff Jim Clark of Lowndes County, Alabama that much of an ignorant cracker that he won't control or want to control his deputies and 'volunteers' when push come to shove? The answer he gets is an unequivocal yes. And so it's decided that Selma is where we make our stand.<br/><br/>I was all of 18 when the real events of Selma occurred. In the wake of the Kennedy assassination the Civil Rights Act was finally passed. Now in the wake of Lyndon Johnson's election in his own right as president part of the Selma story is how Martin Luther King and many others made sure Johnson didn't forget his commitment. Civil rights laws forbidding discrimination is one thing, but without political power because black people are ruthlessly and systematically kept from voting it means very little when no redress can be had at the polls. <br/><br/>Tom Wilkinson plays the harassed and beleaguered LBJ who truthfully did have a lot on his plate in 1965. He was about to start a war on poverty with campaigns on many levels. He also was about to escalate a war in Vietnam and that part of the story is judiciously left out, probably rightly for the purposes of this picture and its narrative flow. But it was there nonetheless. Lest Johnson be distracted by the good and bad things he wanted to do it was up to the Civil Rights activists to keep his feet to the fire and the flames well stoked. <br/><br/>So it was in 1965 and the events dramatized here I remember the media sending these images around the world to see. A dark side of America was exposed, an evil that had to be dealt with forthwith. What we get in Selma is both the public and private stories.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo and Carmen Ejogo play Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King and do a good enough job that we see their private lives. Tim Roth plays Governor George Wallace and interesting seeing two British players Wilkins and Roth in the confrontation scene between the president and the governor. Dylan Baker plays the serpentine and evil J.Edgar Hoover the closest thing we've had to permanent government. He fed spicy bits to 8 presidents and no one liked that better than LBJ. It appealed to the more prurient aspects of his nature.<br/><br/>Wallace to had his own Hoover and it was in the form of Al Lingo the head of the Alabama State Troopers. Lingo is a truly sinister figure and he's played here by Stephen Root and he has one scene with Roth as they decide what to do about the civil rights marchers. Lingo had his own intelligence service to report about Communists and his definition was those agitated for black people to not know their place. Later on he was active in Wallace's national campaigns and other ultra right wing causes.<br/><br/>Selma got one Oscar for Best Song entitled Glory which was a blend of both gospel and rap styles. Not that I'm a big fan of the latter, still it was a deserved winner. Selma was also nominated for Best Picture. It should have won in my book.<br/><br/>This film is about one of the defining moments in American history, one which many like myself saw unfold and one where many participants of the march from Selma to Montgomery are still with us. Their story needs to be seen by generations to come."

I think my younger son is still captivated by him, since he holds his picture on his skype main page.<br/><br/>This film is fine portrayal of the part of that struggle for the black people in the USA in the 1960*s.

","A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.<br/><br/>Selma stars David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King in the first official theatrically released biopic about the legendary leader. The question is how can this film be the first one? This is sad to have waited for so long and so this film is very welcome. It is a great movie. Firstly, I have to admit that I was a little worried of how sentimental or too romanticised those kind of movie can be, and that, because Biopics have to be inspirational. However here, Selma is not cheesy or melodramatic at all. It takes a very factual look at things that happened on this specific period of his life and more importantly MLK doesn't look God-like, flawless or perfect. The movie doesn't loose that Human focused centre. It doesn't shy away from some of the flaws of the real man that are well known. I found that really interesting because he was first and foremost a human being just like any of us. Obviously he is this iconic leader who march in order to make his point relevant for other people to understand but deep behind, he is just a regular man, with doubts. This is important to show especially when the legends are too big, so the people can identify with the character, he's just like you and me. David Oyelowo is amazing in this film, he really captured what MLK fight for and of all the speeches I've studied he embodies the man spirit perfectly. However, there is no other really interesting character beside MLK which is sad because there were a lot of other people around him who were equally involved with the movement; but Oyelowo as MLK is so damn good that all other characters suffered because of that. Finally, the ""normal"" scenes when he's home with his wife and children are equally as powerful as the speech scenes. Throughout the whole movie there is this political chest game happening between the government and MLK Civil Right Movement as they're not just marching, actual political issues were involved. Some scenes are hard to watch as that is what happened 50 years ago in Selma, Alabama. That was a really dark time in Human History.<br/><br/>Overall Selma is a very factual and straight forward movie, filled with excellent performances and a very good directing/editing. A powerful movie."
"sivanandrao","8","1","2","10 March 2015"," Excellent Biopic without deviating to commercial cinema
","Selma is a strong Biopic directed by Ava DuVernay. The movie mainly concentrates on the run up to the march by Martin Luther King & Co from Selma to Montgomery. It discusses about the struggle undergone by King and his family. Also deals with other losses which eventually lead up-to to the equal voting rights. The films backs mainly on the power packed acting of David Oyelowo. He has done complete justice to the job given to him. King was known to be a beautiful orator and David Oyelowo has done exactly that on screen. Tom Wilkinson as the President who has to take a call on passing the bill is great. A very intense story with some powerful acting and crisp screenplay has made Selma a complete movie. P.S : Wait and listen to the song ""Glory"" played during the end credit. Phenomenal!!!"

","Selma focuses on the voting rights marches that took place in 1965 between Selma and Montgomery. These marches, led by Martin Luther King Jr., was integral in furthering the goals of the Civil Rights Movement. <br/><br/>QUICK PERSONAL REVIEW: Although I wasn't as emotionally touched by this movie as I was with 12 Years a Slave, this is still the kind of movie that could make anyone give it a standing ovation. Ava DuVernay and her team effortlessly recreate the marches that took place nearly fifty years ago - instilling them with the same look, spirit, and pain. Meanwhile, David Oyelowo accomplishes the difficult task of transforming MLK Jr. from the legendary figure we're all familiar with to just a regular human being who we can all relate to (this film shows many of his conflicts and flaws at that time period). However, when it comes down to giving his speeches and sermons, Oyelowo recites with the same visceral power reminiscent of MLK Jr. The supporting cast is great as well - Tom Wilkinson, Carmen Egojo, and even Oprah Winfrey (who has a couple of key moments to herself as Annie Lee Cooper) are among some of the standouts. To tie things up, the magnificent ""Glory"" kept me around for the end credits."

I was aware of Martin Luther King as being an iconic figure of the sixties, alongside Kennedy and Malcolm X. However, this film offers a wonderful insight into the man, his motives and his aims. His methods were much more sophisticated than I would have imagined. His humanity, his incredibly moving speeches, his flaws and his charisma are portrayed brilliantly in this movie. The lead actor thoroughly deserved an Oscar. The entire cast of the movie were strong in their portrayal of the other roles. If you watch this film and are left unmoved by the courage, solidarity, and real emotion portrayed by the central characters, then you must have a heart of stone."

","There have been many films that rightly glorify Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, but Selma is the first movie to showcase the internal battles within the movement. Director Ava Duvernay places the focus on King's struggles ‚Äî not just with the people against him but also with the people on his side. David Oyelowo plays a King who remained determined in his battles with President Lyndon Johnson, his right-hand man Andrew Young and Malcom X. In the penultimate moment of the Selma march, we find King not engaged in a fight against segregationists, but in a struggle to save his marriage. Selma humanizes King, which strengthens his legacy."

","""Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe."" Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been passed, African Americans are still struggling for voting equality. President Johnson isn't willing to help Martin Luther King Jr. (Oyelowo) in this movement until after the election cycle. When a group of African American's decide to March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama in order to raise awareness they are attacked and beaten. Left with no other option Martin Luther King decides to join in the next march while President Johnson and Governor Wallace are stuck in the middle of the ethical debate. Before I watched this movie all I heard about was how it was snubbed by the Oscars for Actor and Director. ""How can a movie only be up for best picture and nothing else?"" I went in with that mindset. After watching this I have to say I agree with the nomination. The movie is very good and very much worth seeing. The pacing of the movie was very jerky though. Just when the movie becomes tense it begins to slow down and loses the momentum it had going for it. Oyelowo did a really good job playing Dr. King, but he seemed to lack passion in the speeches and it felt like he was trying to just re-create what he watched the real Dr. King do. On the other hand though, when you are playing someone that iconic you are more or less not trying to screw it up and the tenseness of playing Dr. King really showed. All of that said though the movie is very good and I do recommend it. Overall, this is one of the better movies of the year, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. Much like The Butler it is not deserving of multiple awards even though the subject matter is important. I disappointingly give this a B."

","I saw the trailer for this film, I was definitely looking forward to a film about the eponymous black man who spoke the famous ""I have a dream"" speech, and of course the film being nominated in awards season made it appealing as well. Based on the true events, in 1964 African American Baptist minister, activist and humanitarian Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Golden Globe nominated David Oyelowo) wins the Nobel Peace Prize, meanwhile four African American girls are killed in an explosion in a church, and in Selma, Alabama, African American Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey, also producing) is refused the right to vote. King meets President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to change federal legislation to allow black citizens to vote without prejudice, but the President dismisses this saying there are more important things, so King travels to Selma, with Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo), Andrew Young (Andr√© Holland), James Orange (Road Trip's Omar J. Dorsey) and Diane Nash (Tessa Thompson), he meets James Bevel (rapper Common) and other SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference) activists. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (Happiness's Dylan Baker) tells Johnson that King is a problem, suggesting they should disrupt his marriage, Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) does have concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma, King and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register, but police gather in front of the courthouse, and Cooper knocks Sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston) to the ground, she, King and others are arrested. Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) speaks out against the movement, Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) says to Coretta he will drive whites to ally with King, Wallace and Colonel Al Lingo (Stephen Root) use force in an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama, with state troopers assaulting the marchers, in a restaurant hiding a group of protesters are beaten, and Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) is shot dead, Jackson's grandfather Cager Lee (Henry G. Sanders) is devastated, King tells the people to continue to fight for their rights, his children are threatened, and he is criticised by members of the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee). King considers for a moment cancelling the Selma to Montgomery march, but Young convinces him to persevere, marchers include John Lewis (Stephan James) of SNCC, Reverend Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce) of SCLC and Selma activist Amelia Boynton (Lorraine Toussaint), state troopers with gas masks wait for them as they cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they then attack with clubs, horses, tear gas and other weapons, many including Lewis and Boynton are badly injured. The attack is shown on national television and covers the front pages of newspapers, movement attorney Fred Gray (Cuba Gooding Jr.) asks federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson (Martin Sheen) to let the march go forward, President Johnson demand King and Wallace to stop their actions, and John Doar (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola) is sent to convince King to postpone the next march. But the second march sees white Americans, including Viola Liuzzo (Tara Ochs) and James Reeb (Jeremy Strong), joining them, the troopers are lined up as the marchers cross the bridge again, but this time the troopers turn aside to let them pass, King pauses and prayers, then turns to lead the group away, with SNCC activists giving him sharp criticism, that evening Reeb is beaten to death on the street by two white men, King is told, the march is allowed by Judge Johnson. Before a Joint Session of Congress the courage of the activists is praised by President Johnson, he asks to create a bill that will eliminate restrictions on voting in all form elections and polls, his speech proclaims ""We shall overcome"". The march finally occurs, real footage of the actual event juxtaposes the scene, the marchers reach Montgomery and on the steps of the State Capitol King delivers a speech, the closing text tells that Liuzzo was shot and killed hours later driving back to Selma, and King concludes saying that equality for African Americans is coming, and he continued his work until he was shot. Also starring Giovanni Ribisi as Lee White and E. Roger Mitchell as Frederick Reese. British actor Oyelowo has a great resemblance to the real Martin Luther King Jr., he gives a terrific career-defining performance, Wilkinson is a good choice as President Johnson, and the supporting stars including Winfrey and Common do well also, this is not a biopic about King, it focuses on the three civil rights marches, the moments of racism and cruel violence are hard to watch, but it all feels authentic for the time period, with a great script for the small moments and sweeping action for the bigger ones, these are the sort of brave films that should be made more, a fantastic historical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""Glory"" by Common and John Legend (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director for Ava DuVernay. Very good!"
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","2","18 February 2015"," Beams with Sweeping Artistry
","A narrative film with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as the protagonist has never been made. Think about that for a minute. One of the most revered American heroes in history and the face of the fight for equality has never been the focus of a movie before, despite the raging desire for biopics in Hollywood. (It is mindboggling to think about the impact Dr. King had, and the wealth of knowledge even young children know about him without a driving influence from the movies.) But that has changed now: ""Selma"" is the first film to position the narrative from Dr. King's point of view.<br/><br/>Set in 1964, the film begins with Annie Lee Cooper (portrayed by Oprah Winfrey) trying to register to vote in Selma, AL. Even with the necessary paperwork and knowledge, the registrar harasses Annie with grueling questions about government and the state, to all of which she replies accurately except for the final question that is nearly impossible to answer. Her application is thus denied. This scene paves the framework for the film, establishing the setting of the crux of the film and the bitter racial tensions surrounding the time period.<br/><br/>Martin Luther King, Jr. (played by David Oyelowo) frequently meets with President Lyndon B. Johnson, pleading with him to support the Voting Rights Act and to prevent obstruction and harassment of black citizens when they attempt to register to vote. President Johnson shrugs this off as a more trivial problem than other issues he must deal with. Dr. King devises a nonviolent protest, a march through Selma to the voting registration office. After this ends in an altercation and the nonviolent protesters are arrested, but another march from Selma to Montgomery is planned under Dr. King's resolute agenda for justice.<br/><br/>""Selma"" is an exhilarating movie, one that feels especially relevant in the social climate of today where our society faces racial injustices like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The movie does not preach nor intend to spark white guilt, but instead presents significant facts of the past in an absorbing way. It feels less like a history lesson and more like a bedtime story our parents tell us before we fall asleep.<br/><br/>The Academy Award nominations were announced in January and though ""Selma"" was among the eight films nominated for Best Picture, it only received one other nomination for Best Original Song. Many critics and Oscar pundits voiced their disappointment in the egregious snubs Selma endured for Ava DuVernay in Best Director and Oyelowo in Best Actor. When watching ""Selma,"" it feels like Oyelowo was sent from God to portray Dr. King. Not only does he bear a resemblance to Dr. King and finds the distinctive outward traits of the man, he also inhabits the man beneath his surface.<br/><br/>Seldom are there movies where the directing upstages the story and actors, but ""Selma"" is one of those cases. DuVernay's sensational approach beams with a sweeping artistry. If she had been welcomed by the Academy, DuVernay would have been the first African American director ever nominated. Her work in ""Selma"" would have been worthy of holding such a landmark title in Oscar history.<br/><br/>""Selma"" is the defining film that deserves to be tied to Martin Luther King Jr.'s revered legacy. It is something that should be seen by everyone across the country as a reminder of how far we have come as a society in acknowledging equal rights for everyone, and as even a bigger reminder of how far we still have a long way to go before the fight that Dr. King began is truly over.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>* * * * / * * * *"
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","Null","1","2","16 February 2015"," An astounding biopic that shows us the heart of (a) man.
","The film begins with an intimate close-up of Martin Luther King facing the camera, speaking. In dim lighting, against an ill-defined background, he could be anywhere, talking to anyone, the power of his words carrying an unquantifiable potential for change. Then we learn he is in a hotel room, 'backstage' so to speak, preparing his acceptance speech for his Nobel Peace Prize in the company of his wife. This introduces what the film does so well: giving us a real, tangible human King beyond the thunderously confident public presence that we are all acquainted with, and choosing a time in history that perfectly illustrates this. Had the film gone back earlier in time, we might have had a day-time biopic in a 'rising through the ranks' type manner, if any later it would lose the significance of what was achieved here. It can be too easy to forget that beyond the impeccably delivered speeches King was a living, breathing man living moment-to- moment, fighting against ever-opposing tides. In just the first few minutes in King's eyes we can see both his trademark indomitable confidence and a real tentativeness, and I wondered why David Oyelowo has not just been brushed aside all awards season, but rarely talked about. I mean, all resounding adjectives aside, surely this is one of the most convincing performances of the last year alone. <br/><br/>An admirable performance can only elevate a film so far, and this might have been another Dallas Buyers Club scenario in which its actors' magic is such that it convinces you the film is better than it really is. I think Selma avoids this, and never lets itself become a satisfied, crowd-pleasing uplift that we leave the cinema from convinced that humanity is wonderful and will always triumph. There is generally enough weight to the film to keep it grounded in not just something that feels like reality, but one that could collapse at any moment, even though the general course of events have been rendered and we know their destination. Oyelowo is largely responsible for this, yes, as he really conveys the perpetual-struggle of King's position, but the director and cinematographer deserve credit too. When King is in prison, he is barely lit, swamped in doubt, and in this quiet reflection we can really appreciate the immense difficulty of fulfilling his responsibility to himself, to the God he frequently talks about and prays too and the legions of black people across America that he has to ensure remain just that, legions, united, and not just a chaotic and vengeful swarm, which they probably have every right to be. When he and his followers are assaulted by police as they attempt to protest outside the registration office, we can see the anger, disgust, sympathy, and barely repressible instinct to physically act somehow, as he holds so firmly to his complete civility. Would a more by-the-numbers biopic have done this? Perhaps, but not so well. <br/><br/>When Mrs King quietly confronts her husband about his possible infidelities, his yes-or-no response takes an agonisingly long time to arrive, and as the camera lingers on his face we can sense him desperately considering everything, because here is not just a man caught in an uncomfortable domestic situation, but something much larger than that. His personal and public life are so intertwined that they cannot be separated. That long silence between the question and the answer is evidence of a director knowing exactly what they are doing. Ava Gardner knows that this is a man in a unique situation, and she really allows us to experience that. As well as this film escapes a by-the-numbers routine, there are still times where it feels like its lapsing into a formulaic mode to push the drama forward. All of the presidential scenes, as competently acted as they were and as necessary as they were for dramatic conflict, just felt perfunctory compared to the rest of the film. People have complained that the portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson is historically inaccurate to the point where he is disreputable or unforgiving, but the film makes it pretty clear that as much as this man might be hesitant for his own selfish reasons is essentially navigating a vast field of political land mines, and is not so much uncooperative as he is cautious. But all these scenes of the president that the film regularly cuts away to, usually to present the political reaction to the latest event, just seem like the film wants to keep reminding us of the scale of King's fight, or that the fight isn't with El Presidento himself but with something more abstract like the firm values of society, or maybe so we can feel warm and exhilarated every time we cut back to King. When King and Johnson are together the strained relationship between the two is constantly tugging in differing directions, and it's interesting, but otherwise not so much. Tom Wilkinson is always effective, but maybe his character just feels like most other reluctant-to-help-the-hero types we've encountered before, and does get to do much more. Giovanni Ribisi is like a less amorous Waylon Smithers, and Tim Roth added to the novelty of having two British actors playing the most important American politicians of the film. <br/><br/>Then there's Oprah Winfrey, who managed to sneak into the film without drawing attention to her, or without the film having to constantly announce her presence. The film has integrity, which comes naturally with the material, it has authenticity, as the archive footage at the end demonstrates the attention to detail and the sound-bites of King himself prove how indistinguishable Oyelowo is from the figure he is playing, and it has artistic flourish, and my mind is continually drawn back to the shot of the protesters in the nightly march, silhouetted against stark white light and running desperately, in a moment of an overpowering societal divide that feels like something from Schindler's List."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","16 February 2015"," A Huge Career Leap For Actor David Oyelowo & Director Ava DeVernay
","Keeping in view the current incidents surrounding the Ferguson protests which has once again escalated the racial tensions in the United States, the timing & arrival of Selma couldn't have been more apt. Not because it brings any solution to the present unrest situation but brilliantly demonstrates just how far we still remain from an ideal society that treats everyone as equal, no matter what their race, colour or creed is.<br/><br/>Set in the titular city of Alabama state in 1965, the story of Selma concerns events surrounding the Voting Rights Movement carried out by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. & his organisation which ultimately led to the famous protest march from Selma to Montgomery as an exhibition of black American citizens' desire to be allowed their constitutional right to vote, that was granted later that year with the passing of Voting Rights Act.<br/><br/>Directed by Ava DuVernay, Selma is crafted with meticulous care & passion, focuses on one event that became a landmark achievement of the 1960s America Civil Rights Movement and through that, successfully captures Dr. King's vision, tactics, political skills & even flaws. Set pieces nicely recreate the timeline its story is set in, Camera-work is brilliantly carried out, Editing works for the most part & its background score only gets better as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Selma features a highly committed cast in David Oyelowo, Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Carmen Ejogo, Oprah Winfrey & others, and all of them have done a fabulous job in their given roles. But spearheading the acting department is Oyelowo who is absolutely brilliant, charming & believable in the role of the legendary civil rights leader and it's a shame that his revelatory performance was completely sidelined by the Academy.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Selma is an impressive piece of history filmmaking that's very gripping when all its elements are balancing each other yet there are few instances where its narrative feels dramatically stale & could've used a few more trims. Although by no means a truly great picture, Selma still makes up for an essential viewing thanks to Oyelowo's commanding lead performance & DuVernay's passionate direction and does a fascinating job in honouring the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."
"gavin6942","7","1","2","15 February 2015"," Good Focus, Some Breakthrough Acting
","A chronicle of Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.<br/><br/>Whether or not the film is completely historically accurate is open to debate. Particularly the portrayal of Lyndon Johnson. But this is not necessarily the point of a film... if it gets people to look into civil rights history more, good for everyone involved! The portrayal of King is excellent. Not just the acting (which is superb), but its fairness. It is all too easy to show him as a martyr or a saint. This film did neither. By avoiding his assassination and actually bringing up his infidelity, he comes across as very human, and someone who accomplished great things despite his personal failings.<br/><br/>This is also a breakout role for Tim Roth. Although best known for ""Reservoir Dogs"", Roth is a top notch actor and he proves it here as the villain. The Oscar buzz is around the failure to nominate Ava DuVernay as director, but perhaps Roth should be looked at again for supporting actor."
"marivic_gabriel","10","1","2","14 February 2015"," It got me thinking.
","I get why he didn't get an Oscar nomination. It's not that he wasn't great, he was, but the whole movie wasn't just about him, it was about everyone at that time, in that moment. To give him an Oscar simply meant that they needed to give it to everyone else.<br/><br/>The movie showed passion and loyalty and everything else that makes it a great movement.<br/><br/>One thing they didn't get right, which DuVernay herself admitted, was King's relationship with the President. I don't know everything that happened at that time, I'm not American, but I've read a lot of things even before the movie. I was curious. Everything I've read never suggested there was that kind of negative friction between the two. Maybe there was some kind of a pissing contest between the two, they are men after all, but who knows what really happened behind closed doors. Still, I never got that, vibe. Anyways it added drama, IT IS a movie so people should be open to storytelling, and most of the time storytelling includes drama and that includes a little fiction.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is the only movie I've seen, so far, that got me interested with everyone. It told a story of, not just one man, but every little or big, good or bad people involved"
"ianlouisiana","8","1","2","10 February 2015"," ""Selma"" :- an outsider's view.
","As an Englishman my view of the events portrayed in ""Selma"" is conditioned by contemporary reports shown on the BBC and cinema newsreels. We saw the de - segregation of schools in The South,George Wallace,Little Rock,Rosa Parks and the Freedom Marchers at one remove. There was a relatively small number of black people living here in the 1950s and they had the vote were educated and neither hated nor feared.They had come to this country voluntarily,not brought in chains. We felt rather smug about that. When Kennedy became President I rather naively thought one of his first priorities would be to address such inequalities but it was not to be so and he was soon engaged in a p*ss*ng contest with Kruschev that took our eyes of the ball.It took his much - maligned successor LBJ to confront the problems,however reluctantly.He may have been a potty - mouthed,bigoted corrupt oilman but he wasn't a fool. And he did more for race equality in the U.S.than any of his predecessors and most of his successors. As I say,that's an outsider's view. And largely one promulgated by ""Selma"",a well - made,well - acted story of Dr.Martin Luther King's battles against ignorance and hatred,organised opposition and state - controlled violence. It may be difficult for younger viewers to credit the implacable hatred shown by the Authorities towards what they saw as a challenge to the status quo(and they were right,for that is exactly what the protests were all about). Emotions were raw on both sides. The film pulls few punches and is obviously a deeply - felt work that will inform generations to come of the hard - won rights that can too easily be taken for granted in times of relative tranquility but have recently been brought into sharper focus. It is of course a creative piece and the child of the director but has more than enough hard truths that she has refused to smooth out. Not an easy view then,but an essential one."
"cleary-joshua","9","1","2","9 February 2015"," This film isolates an event as an example of the bigger picture...
","Perhaps it shows my broad lack of knowledge about the Civil Rights movement in America, but if I were to make a biopic of Martin Luther King, it would probably contain two important events ‚Äì the famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, and his eventual assassination. ""Selma"" contains neither of those things, and to be honest I was extremely glad that it didn't. Apart from the fact that ""I Have a Dream"" is so important and influential that perhaps no other man should perform it, the film succeeds in showing us a single event in the man's career, rather than the entire thing. It isolates this event as an example of his influence and determination, and succeeds as a snapshot which we can easily extrapolate to get a wider idea of the difficulties of the time.<br/><br/>In the American South, black people are still unable to vote, despite it being their legal right to do so ‚Äì they are constantly barred by white officials who make up ridiculous rules so that they can't register. Despite the movement coming on so far, there is still so much work to do, and Martin Luther King is not giving up. He has numerous tense meetings with President Lyndon B. Johnson in which he attempts to get what he wants, but the President isn't budging. In King's mind, there is only one thing to do ‚Äì travel to Selma, a small town in Alabama, to make an example of how black people are treated. King always knew how to influence people in non-violent ways. He stages marches which he knows will end with black people being treated violently, so that the horrific and brutal scenes are on the front of the national newspapers every single morning.<br/><br/>King's tactics are admirable, and it is so incredible to see the extent to which he refuses to be violent or destructive, and always remains extremely calm. The FBI try to break up his relationship with his wife, and there are very moving scenes where the tension between the two of them becomes almost too much, but they are able to stay together despite all of this. In choosing the events in Selma as a case study, we get a glimpse of the much wider picture: not every black person agreed with King's methods (including Malcolm X, who later sided with them); the white population were extremely divided, but many came out in person to support; and most importantly, King was one of the greatest orators of the 20th century. We are shown a few of his sermons at the church in Selma, and the way he speaks is truly inspirational. In this, we are also shown the quality of David Oyelowo's performance, which is so moving and powerful, since he truly believes in what he is saying, and is not just reciting words on a script.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of the film is also extremely strong, with special mention going to Carmen Ejogo as Coretta King for her excellent portrayal of their marital struggles. It doesn't take itself too seriously at times, and it's not at all a depressing two hours, despite knowing when it needs to shock. The fact that it only takes place in a short period of time means that it rarely drags, and it constantly wears its message on its sleeve. As well as all of this, it is visually extremely satisfying, with excellent use of imagery and some very beautiful shots. The framing of King's speeches in the church, as an example, is truly perfect.<br/><br/>It's a huge shame that Oyelowo doesn't have an Oscar nomination. It is easy to compare this to ""12 Years a Slave"" since both tackle ideas about race, and in many ways this is a stronger film. Both tackle ideas about resilience and strength of mind, but this makes you care so personally for a much broader range of characters. You root for them throughout, and the final scenes honestly brought me extremely close to tears. It's one of the most powerful films I've seen in a long time, and is a worthy representation of a truly great man."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","2","8 February 2015"," Great movie with genuine performances
","This academy award nominated drama set during the 1964 civil rights movement is truly entertaining and one of the best films of 2014. This film not only boasts a strong cast and performances but gives a realistic showcase of the events that took place during the civil rights movement. In some scenes, it will have you cheering for the bravery of the characters and in other scenes it will leave you have you in shock. Overall, Selma is pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Selma follows the story of Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, and his effort on garnering equal rights for African Americans. His efforts however, put the lives of people around him in danger. David Oyelowo's performance as King was amazing and definitely ""Oscar material"". I love scenes when King was speaking in front of everyone, his speeches were inspiring and interesting to listens to. The best scene is the march in Montgomery and the police attacks that it leads to. The scene was so realistic and probably the most powerful scene in the movie. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","2","7 February 2015"," Tragic, mesmerising and powerful
","I have never been so ashamed of the human race as I am right now, writing this review after seeing history depicted in Selma. It is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen, so much so that I struggle to find words to describe its amazing work.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is mesmerising in the role of Martin Luther King, completely vanishing into the part. Not only does he have King's voice and appearance locked, he carries such a magnetic presence that he could very well be channeling the spirit of the great man himself. Not since Sean Penn portrayed Harvey Milk have I seen such a respectful and authentic performance. The supporting cast has strong performances - Wilkinson as LBJ for one, and a devastating turn by Robert G. Sanders for another - but for the most part they are subtle and allow Oyelowo and DuVernay to craft the tale. <br/><br/>DuVernay is superb in the directors chair. All of the artistic choices are executed so well and Selma contains some of the most devastating cinema ever put to screen. On a small personal favourite, the CIA logs as captions for historical events is a fantastic idea that works splendidly with the story.<br/><br/>Twist my arm for a flaw, and I'll point to the script. There is so much wonderful stuff in here, its terrible to point to it as the flaw, but I must. Selma does a wonderful job of depicting MLK as a normal man, but there is one too many scenes of him in self-doubt (especially where its placement makes no sense) and one too many scenes of Coretta Scott King and her marital problems with King. At one point I felt like the film was beating me over the head saying ""LOOK! SEE? HE'S NORMAL LIKE YOU!"" That subplot looked to feature prominently, but was promptly discarded halfway through and never revisited. <br/><br/>But I will not dwell any further on the flaws. With Pride and Boyhood, Selma forms a might trio of 2014's profoundly affecting films, and deserves all of the praise it can get in the years to come."

","Diane and I saw this marvelous film yesterday in Fremantle and both of us were moved by the images of those now long ago years. She did not think as highly of the film as I did; she thought it was a bit ""cheesy"" but I on the other hand thought that all that I saw on the screen dovetailed perfectly with my memories of TV news watching of those years ago; I enjoyed every moment of this ""return.""<br/><br/>I thought that the casting and the makeup people did a superb job: Andrew Young looked as he did and Ralph Abernathy looked as I remember him. Diane did not think that Johnson looked as she remembered but his thinning hair was a dead giveaway. Coretta King was, again, unmistakable. Some of the other, George Wallace for instance, needed the surrounds of history to bring him into focus but those are minor points considering the huge scale of personalities that peppered the playing field of those tumultuous years.<br/><br/>I have not mentioned the figure of Martin Luther King who appeared, virtually, in every scene of the film. His appearance was captured very well but who besides King could deliver those almost melodious speeches that we all know: the most perfect speeches ever to be heard by human beings and not one but literally dozens of them.<br/><br/>I was literally frightened by the scenes of the film even though I knew what would happen from memories of TV broadcasts in the early Sixties; the gut wrenching thump of the police batons could make you sick and just emphasized the courage of the white Freedom Marchers and the Black Freedom Marchers who faced those batons in the name of Nonviolence only armed with the weapon of courage. <br/><br/>See this film even if you think you have heard enough of those people and events."
"maurice_yacowar","8","1","2","2 February 2015"," Dr Martin Luther King leads the Selma fight for voting rights
","Ava DuVernay's Selma is more important as a social document than as a film. It reminds America of the brutal history from which it has not yet escaped. Like any period piece it reflects not just the time of its setting but also the time it is made.<br/><br/>First, it recalls the drama of Martin Luther King's leadership in the 1965 march from Selma Alabama to the capital city Montgomery. That forced the Voting Rights Act ensuring African Americans the unimpeded right to vote. It's a stirring story but a sad one because it recalls the horrible violence of the white suppression of the negro, extending to the murder of white sympathizers as well. The blatant hatred is chilling.<br/><br/>The black woman director makes this very much the black perspective on those events, without the usual valorizing of some whites. She pulls no punches on the violence, especially in the church explosion that killed five little girls and in the vicious police attacks on civilians. It's also the woman's perspective, as Coretta King's role is emphasized, especially in mediating between King and Malcolm X, and in the assertive career of a hospital worker played by Oprah Winfrey.<br/><br/>When the epilogue text explains the later career of King's aides Selma becomes the turning point in US politics. From there a generation of African Americans moved into the mainstream. And Dr King's speeches still stir the soul.<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly, the film reflects on today. Clearly the nation is still stuck in the quagmire of racism. The political system still privileges the white man. That's what Sarah Palin was saying when in the wake of Obama's first election she declared ""Give us back our country."" There is still a systematic suppression of the underclass's attempt to vote, whether in voter registration, voting regulations and conditions, or the farce of the hanging chads that snuck G.W. Bush past Al Gore. Especially given the new unbridled power of the PACS, the voting system is still rigged and corrupt.<br/><br/>Nor has President Johnson's War on Poverty been won either. If anything the gap between the richest and the poor has widened and the number and desperation of the poor have ballooned. Cops still get away with the unwarranted murder of African Americans, as do white civilians armed with the Stand Your Ground clause. <br/><br/>So electing a black president did not make America post-racist after all. In the Republicans' belligerent refusal to respect his office, explicitly preferring to ruin the economy rather than cooperate, and in the virulence the president has evoked in the vox populi, the old racism has metastasized but remains systemic. <br/><br/>If we don't have a George Wallace now we have the Koch brothers poised to spend a billion to buy the next election. The Right-dominated Supreme Court is a far cry from the assuring humanity of the film's judge, Martin Sheen (of course). Seeing the engagement of the Christian church in the civil rights movement, one has to ask where is the church today? Where are the church leaders speaking out against the oppression of the Spanish American underclass, the systemic poverty and restrictions on education and voting rights? And how do today's Tea Party class and Christian Republicans stand against the leadership their church took in the civil rights movement then? <br/><br/>We need to see Selma, then, both to be reminded of that signal point in American history and to see how our present system harbours new forms of the old systemic bigotry and inequality.<br/><br/>With that important business going on here it seems trivial to reduce the discussion to the film's Oscar nominations. The Best Picture nomination acknowledges its importance and its achievement. As for the other categories, there was just too much better competition this year. As a film this isn't in the same league as Boyhood, Birdman, Foxcatche etc. But Selma has a social value beyond its mere function as a film and for that we should be grateful."
"virek213","10","1","2","30 January 2015"," The 50-Mile March That Changed American History
","The civil rights movement that galvanized people of all ages, races, colors, creeds, and religions in the America of the 1960s was one of the most important parts of our history; and at the head of all this was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. Even after the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, and the March on Washington in 1963, black churches in the segregated South were still being bombed; black people were still being lynched; and voting rights were still being denied to those who were neither White nor possessed of enough money. Meanwhile in Washington, even with the Civil Rights Act having been passed, President Lyndon Johnson was still vacillating over the issue of voting rights. To get the point across to Johnson that this was a moral issue, Dr. King and his people organized what became the Selma-to-Montgomery march in March 1965. That event and the things that led up to it are at the heart of director Ava DuVernay's powerful 2014 historical film SELMA.<br/><br/>SELMA begins with one of the aforementioned church bombings that characterized the White Southern backlash against the civil rights movement following the killings of three Voting Rights workers in August 1964, and follows the efforts of Dr. King (portrayed here by David Oleyowo) as he attempts to organize a big event that would galvanize the nation. Even as he does this, with help from his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), he is constantly being dogged by hostile forces‚Äîin a covert way from the machinations of FBI chieftain J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and in a more overt and violent way from Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Dallas County sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston), plus the brutality from the white segregationists and Ku Klux Klansmen. And there is the issue of Oleyowo's infidelity towards Ejogo at this crucial time in his life and in the life of the movement that he is leading. But once he goes through all these elements, he remains resolute, even through the attempts by Johnson (Wilkinson) to have Oleyowo stop the movement (and supposedly stop the violence), Selma soon becomes the new epicenter of King's quest for equality. It comes at a bloody cost, first with the Bloody Sunday incident on March 7th, and then the KKK-administered beating of one of King's white supporters just a night or two later. None of this deters Oleyowo's quest, however; and on March 21st, he and 8,000 of his fellow citizens, black, white, Jewish, gentile, Protestants, and Catholics alike, make the 50-mile march from Selma, across the infamous Edmund Pettis Bridge, and through two very dangerous Alabama counties to the state capital in Montgomery to press the case.<br/><br/>While it can be said that we have made incredibly great strides to get away from the overt bigotry of the past, even with an African-American in the White House at the time of its release, SELMA depicts a time in our history that, though long past, is still relevant today. Racism and bigotry are always going to be parts of certain Americans' DNA, especially since the nation, in the 21st century, is becoming much more ethnically diversified and less White. But it was not always so in Dr. King's time, when blacks often made up the majority of rural counties in the South, but only constituted maybe two percent of the eligible voting population, hemmed in as they were by regulations drawn up by segregationists. Both director DuVernay and screenwriter Webb depict this in very stark fashion, with Oleyowo giving a very stoic performance as the great Dr. King, and Ejiogo equally fine as his wife Coretta. Wilkinson and Roth do very good turns as, respectively, the old guard LBJ and the uber-segregationist Wallace. SELMA also features good turns from Cuba Gooding Jr. as one of the young lawyers arguing the case for the march, and Martin Sheen as the Alabama judge who, though perhaps more covert in his racial views, grants the order allowing the march to go forth.<br/><br/>Having seen this film in a theater on Martin Luther King Day in 2015, it made me appreciate even more than I had before how big a part of the mid-to-late 20th century the civil rights movement was in America, at a time when we were going through the most turbulent period in our history since the end of the Civil War; and the lessons from that period are still being absorbed, even though more Americans of non-White ethnicity have entered the political arena in our time. In that sense, SELMA, along with the classic 1970 documentary KING: A FILMED RECORD¬ÖMONTGOMERY TO MEMPHIS, will likely become required viewing in years to come in high school, community college, and university classes. While we have made great strides, America as a ""more perfect union"" is still a work in progress, and SELMA, one of the best films of 2014, illustrates why this is still true even in the 21st century."

","The movie Selma, directed by Ava DuVernay is a beautifully realized reminder of the struggle for black voting rights half a century ago. Casting was so perfect that viewers who know the real-life characters can easily identify Andy Young (Andr√© Holland), John Lewis (Stephan James), and other era heroes. (As a Detroit native, I'm glad to see the movie remembered murdered Viola Liuzzo.) Some commenters have quibbled with the movie's historical accuracy‚Äîespecially the portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson‚Äîbut it isn't a documentary, after all, and the presentation is probably more accurate than not. In a personal conversation, a White House insider at the time told me he heard Johnson said to King, ""You have to force me to do what I want to do."" The political risks were too great (and chances of success too small) for Johnson to act unilaterally on voting rights, but if the pressure and public outrage became strong enough‚Äîas they did become after Bloody Sunday‚Äîhe would act and did.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is inspiring as Rev. Martin Luther King‚Äîthoughtful but fiery when he needed to be, and he has King's oratorical cadences down perfectly. Tom Wilkinson is always good, but I missed Lyndon's Texas accent. Oprah, awesome. And Wendell Pierce could just stand anywhere, and I'd be with him a hundred percent. The whole cast, sincere and convincing.<br/><br/>My biggest frustration about the movie is the reaction to it. I hope leaders (black and white) use the triumphal feeling it engenders to remind people how important the courage and sacrifices of the Movement were. (And those of the Suffragettes before them.) But what's happening now? People‚Äîblack and white, men and women‚Äîdon't even bother to use their vote. They may vote for President every four years, but the person at the pinnacle has a lot less influence over our daily lives than the people in the state house, the mayor's office, the township committee, the local school board. Good or bad, those people get picked in the primary elections which have even lower voter turnout, except among extremists. When people don't vote in primaries, every extremist's vote counts more. Meanwhile, Johnson's big contribution--the Voting Rights Act--is being chipped away at in state legislatures. Perhaps the movie will be an educational and motivational tool, so that effective campaigns can be mounted against new voting restrictions and so that all Americans recognize that there's no point in feeling good about this pivotal struggle of 50 years ago if we let it lapse into meaninglessness through apathy today. As the movie so strongly suggests, Rev. King would consider this heartbreaking."

","So, this is a weird case, especially after seeing such a typical, Oscar-type period biographical film. Much of the film really plays like a history lesson. In that case, I can see why it's gotten such unanimous acclaim, but I'm really surprised it got so many standing ovations. I'm not sure how audiences will react to it as a whole. It's sort of subdued for its subject matter ands what one would expect, at times I could even see many finding it sort of dull (I did a few times, mostly in the beginning). It could also be considered sort of ""dry"", but I appreciated that it really didn't force its sentiment really. But it's also more admirable. As a whole, a lot less showy than last year's 12 Years A Slave, the acting as well. David Oyelowo completely captures Luther King's essence. Very unshowy role though, and I honestly forgot I was watching an actor and just the real thing. That's how natural and subdued a performance it is, and as much as I liked him, it's also sort of a hard one to really love. It will be interesting to see how the AMPAS takes to him. Carmen Ejogo is actually showier and has one big scene, something that Oyelowo never gets. She's fantastic in it, but it doesn't really leave much lasting power<br/><br/>I don't know what to grade the film. I certainly didn't love it, but I appreciated more. It's funny, in comparison to a more typical Oscar film like The Imitation Game, it's still harder to love."

In this movie the filmmaker is telling people to stand up for their right. They are also telling us to keep fighting even when things get hard. I knew that in this part of history people were fighting for what they though was right. This part of history is very interesting to me. Yes I have seen other movies from this part of history.

","This honest film shows the struggles of King and his followers against a white majority rule in America. They fought to bring down that rule and this movie tells part of that story. Before the civil rights protests shed light on the issue, the US had a very high crime rate, with rapes and murders skyrocketing. King showed that by granting equal rights to everyone that a white majority would be happier and feel better doing the right thing. Right after President Johnson singed the act, crime went down, rapes stopped, except white males still attacked African American women without remorse, and society became a utopia of tolerance and diversity for those in the movement. Equal rights were given to all non whites, and white supremacy was broken. All because of this movement. Well done director, well done."

","Selma does not disappoint and safely delivers its message. David Oyelowo is the spitting image of the great Martin Luther King Jr however he may not have portrayed him to the full extent. When actors take on monumental figures in history they have very big shoes to fill. Having said that he manages to pull of a nice tribute and likeness to Dr King. The supporting cast did a great job in carrying this film. The film excelled in showing the brutality towards many innocent African Americans and the inhumane behavior of law enforcement. However it felt a bit slow at times and did drag on. Some will argue how accurate the portrayal of LBJ was. Also accusations against MLK being unfaithful were never substantiated and the rumors do not match with the reality of those times. Perhaps this could have been excluded.

"sddavis63","7","1","3","14 May 2017"," An Important Movie About Important Events
","David Oyelowo was brilliant as civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That's a difficult role to play, because King is such an iconic figure to many, and especially because he is essentially a martyr for the cause, having been assassinated a couple of years after the events depicted in this film. But if Oyelowo was even remotely overwhelmed by playing King, he didn't show it. Instead, he captured King. His voice, his mannerisms, his passion. It was truly impressive - the best part of a movie that was generally very good, but at times a bit slow moving.<br/><br/>But more than just featuring a great performance (Oyelowo should have been nominated for an Oscar, I might add) it's an important movie. In fact it's a sobering movie, because it's largely so accurate. It's sobering for me to realize that these events happened in my lifetime. This wasn't the distant past - this was the south of just 50 years ago where racism was a way of life and keeping blacks poor and disenfranchised - through the use of state sanctioned violence if necessary - was accepted political policy. The movie revolves around the struggle for black voting rights in Alabama. In theory, blacks had the right to vote, but in practice various methods were found to prevent them from registering. King and his associates take on the cause and try to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery demanding voting rights for blacks - the first attempt at the march descending into sickening violence against the marchers by the authorities.<br/><br/>In the course of showing the march being organized, there are a lot of points made. The political machinations are revealed and believable. Alabama Governor George Wallace was played by Tim Roth, and President Lyndon Johnson by Tom Wilkinson. Personally, I found Wilkinson difficult to accept as LBJ. To me he just didn't seem right in the part - but the movie makes the point that Johnson had to be pushed to propose the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when he would have preferred to do something less dramatic. The movie also isn't shy about hiding some of the divisions within the leadership of the civil rights movement itself. The movie also notes the prominent place of faith in the civil rights movement.<br/><br/>It has a powerful beginning and ending - the beginning portraying the murder of four young black girls in the bombing of a church, and the movie closes with a gripping piece of music. I often don't bother with the closing credits of a movie, but I left them on to hear the song because I found it so moving.<br/><br/>There were a few parts of this movie that failed to really capture me, and it did seem a little bit inconsistently paced. But it's an important movie portraying important events - and still quite relevant, given many of the concerns today about voter suppression laws which seem aimed largely at blacks, and recent incidents of police violence toward the African American community.

","In 1964 and 1965 Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) became heavily involved in a protest movement in Alabama designed to give all African Americans the vote. As with most of his campaigns, he advocated nonviolent methods, but was often met with violent responses from the white majority, orchestrated by Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth). Dr. King became involved not only with the local community but with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), who was intransigent at first, but eventually swayed by force of circumstance into passing a bill removing all restrictions on the African American vote.<br/><br/>Ava DuVernay's film tells a straightforward tale punctuated by memorable individual sequences. At the beginning Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) enters the courthouse in Selma in a vain attempt to register to vote; she is summarily denied by the white official. Nothing much is actually said but gestures signify everything; the humiliation experienced by Annie Lee set against the arrogance of the official. Later on, in the wake of the first abortive protest mounted by the African American community as they try to cover the fifty or so miles from Selma to the state capital Montgomery, three African Americans enter a diner and pretend to order food, in the vain hope that they will escape the pursuing white state troopers. The troopers enter and summarily beat them senseless, taking the life of Jimmy Lee Jackson (Lakeith Stanfield) in the process.<br/><br/>The film's moral stance is unequivocal; in a world still riddled by institutional racism, the African Americans have a justifiable cause to plead. As performed by Oyelowo, Dr. King comes across as a tenacious personality, unwilling to give up his cause even in the face of overwhelming odds. Every time the President protests his inability to help, Dr. King goads him; we understand from such confrontations just how scared the President actually was of allowing too many concessions to the African American community.<br/><br/>Brilliantly staged, with careful attention to detail, SELMA deserves to be considered a modern classic, marred only slightly by Roth's rather artificial Southern accent as Governor Wallace."

It seems every year we get some sort of film that touches on racism but no movie I have personally seen has effected me quite like this. This tale of Martin Luther King Jr. doesn't follow his entire life, but it doesn't need to. It follows a very important moment in his fight for equal rights in Selma, Alabama to give blacks the same rights to vote as whites. While the story was indeed engaging and had me in it from start to finish, its the respect they give the characters that really shines. David Oyelowo delivers a tour de force performance as the great man himself, but it was his interaction with his followers and the grand speeches that really made my jaw drop. Few performances can actually leave me speechless, this was one of them. He undoubtedly needs to receive some attention come award season. You could fight about what is accurate and what wasn't, but at this point I have come to accept that no biography in cinema will ever stick completely to the true story. If it means a more entertaining experience, I am all for it. This film had me involved emotionally, it didn't shy away from the truths of violence, it delivered its messages respectfully, and best of all it gave us the best portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr. to date. David Oyelowo should be commended, as should director Ava DuVernay for giving us a real depiction of bravery and what a true hero really looks like.

","Selma is a representation of the many hardships the black community's had to endure during the 1960's. The movie took place in Selma, Mississippi where Martin Luther King Junior led peaceful marches to help blacks gain civil rights. He used non-violence to protest against the white supremacy, however the white police officers had a different idea of how to deal with black civil rights. For example, in the movie Martin Luther King Junior led a march from Selma to Alabama but white police officers stopped them by beating them with sticks covered in barbed wire and by shooting them until the blacks retreated. The movie is an excellent documentation of how Martin Luther King Junior fought for civil rights and the difficult circumstances he had to go through.<br/><br/>Although, this movie did an excellent job of portraying the hardships the blacks had to endure while fighting for civil rights, there was one thing that I felt wasn't necessary in the movie. I thought that the appearance of Oprah Winfrey in the movie, took away from the power and emotion the movie had to offer. I felt that Oprah Winfrey was in almost every scene and that, because she is so successful in real life, having her in the movie took away from the theme the movie was trying to express, which is equality for all. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie did a really great job expressing the difficult circumstances that the black communities had to endure in gaining their civil rights. Martin Luther King Junior, played by David Oyelowo, did an outstanding job recreating the passion and commitment Martin Luther had in gaining those rights that blacks so badly wanted. Moreover, I felt that this movie was very well put together and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn about how the blacks successfully gained their civil rights."

","The great African-American poet Langston Hughes in his poem, ""As I Grew Older"" asks us to help him find his dream. ""Help me to shatter this darkness,"" he asks ""to smash this night, to break this shadow into a thousand lights of sun, into a thousand whirling dreams of sun."" Though for many minorities, the thousand lights of sun are still a whirling dream, what it took to begin to break that shadow is movingly depicted in Ava DuVernay's Selma, a dramatization of the campaign in Selma, Alabama to end discrimination against African-American's right to vote, a right guaranteed by the constitution.<br/><br/>The protests, led by the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo), a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who embraced nonviolence to combat violent segregationists, became one of the major turning points in the Civil Rights Movement. Written by Paul Webb with input from the director, the film shows King as both a practical strategist with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a gifted orator. Thankfully, DuVernay does not try to sanitize him but shows him as a fierce opponent of the status quo who was willing to engage in confrontations with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, President Johnson, and Alabama Governor George Wallace to further his goals.<br/><br/>Like Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, the film focuses on a specific period in King's life, the months in which he led highly publicized marches from Selma to Montgomery. After accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, a speech in which he referred to the 1963 bombing that killed four children attending church in Birmingham (shown in flashback), King brought his movement to Selma, Alabama in January, 1965. Although the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 outlawing discrimination, the practice of denying blacks the right to vote was still widespread in the South, demonstrated by showing Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) being subjected to absurd questioning in order to qualify, such as asking her to name all of Alabama's 67 judges.<br/><br/>Though the registration campaign conducted by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) led by John Lewis (Stephan James) and James Forman (Trai Byers) was gaining momentum, it still had little success and King believed that the situation called for the kind of direct action that would capture media attention. On March 7, 1965, Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce) of the SCLC and John Lewis led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery (King was not present).<br/><br/>Only six blocks into the march, at the Edmund Pettis Bridge, state troopers and local police led by Sheriff Jim Clark attacked the peaceful demonstrators with clubs, tear gas, and bull whips, an ugly scene witnessed by the entire country. The beatings, though brutal, are shown discreetly, as is the depiction of the shooting death of young protester Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) by an Alabama state trooper and that of James Reeb (Jeremy Strong), a Boston clergyman, murdered by white racists.<br/><br/>Though the marchers made a second attempt to cross the bridge, this time with both white and black supporters who came from all parts of the country, it was aborted by Dr. King who feared more violence, even though the police had cleared a path for the marchers. In the face of angry criticism, King said that he would rather that people hated him than be beaten or killed. The film also shows King in consultation with President Lyndon Johnson to help push through voting rights legislation. DuVernay has been criticized by former Johnson associates of attempting to falsify the full extent of Johnson's cooperation, but, in response, the director points to an article by Louis Menand in the New Yorker.<br/><br/>In that article, Menand said that though Johnson had directed his Attorney General to prepare a tough voting rights act, he waited, worried that more civil rights legislation would endanger support for the War on Poverty and divert his attention from the then escalating Vietnam War. Johnson eventually decided that the time was right and is generally portrayed as a reasonable man who saw the error of his ways, a dubious proposition since Johnson was a life-long segregationist who, as Vice President, opposed Kennedy's civil rights agenda and repeatedly cautioned President Kennedy to wait ""until the time is right."" Likewise, his response to Dr. King's 1967 speech opposing the Vietnam War is unprintable. To its credit, however, the film does not hesitate to call out Hoover who, with LBJ's approval, attempted to silence Dr. King through wiretaps and anonymous phone calls to his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo), describing her husband's infidelities."" Selma is a welcome breakthrough in its candid depiction of the Civil Rights Movement, a subject mostly avoided for fifty years.<br/><br/>The British actor Oyelowo delivers a convincing performance, one in which he clearly mastered the inflections of Dr. King's speech, though no actor can truly provide more than a shadow of the spiritual power of the man. While the dialogue at times sounds more like speechifying than natural conversation, Selma is a strong film that sends a clear message to a new generation about what standing up against intimidation in any form is all about. It is a passionate work about a towering figure who left an enduring legacy, but one that, as recent events in Ferguson, Cleveland, and New York may indicate, is sadly still short of completion."
"squirrel_burst","10","1","3","16 February 2015"," Historical accuracy be damned, this movie is a powerful experience and a great display of super performances
","Whenever I see a movie about a historical figure, certainly one as famous as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I have two questions a) What new angle is this movie bringing that makes it worth watching in addition to all of the previous footage, documentaries and films we've seen already and b) is the movie good on its own merit, or does the quality of the story reside entirely on the fact that what happened was true, and that history has proved this person to be right in the long run? In the case of ""Selma"" I am excited to say that not only is the film worth seeing even if you are familiar with the events that are being portrayed on-screen, but the performances and the angle at which the story tackled are so strong and so powerful that it's one of the best movies of 2014. This film is similar to 2012 ""Lincoln"" in that it's about Martin Luther King, Jr., but it's not about his entire life, it's about the events that developed in the small town of Selma, Alabama around the 1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches.<br/><br/>I suppose I should begin by saying that this is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy. Even if you're white (like myself) you're not going to be offended, you're not going to feel guilty about the racism being displayed in 1965. Not unless you're racist and you've done similar things to others, at which point either I commend you for being brave enough to see a movie that will hopefully change your views, or you're not even watching this film because you're a fool with Cro-Magnon era beliefs. The reason you will not feel guilty watching this picture is because you are intelligent enough to see past the color of people's skin; you are going to be putting yourself in the shoes of the protesters, not of the racists who attack them. It's a powerful emotional experience, that is often troubling, but it's meant to be. You will feel upset, but it's the good kind of upset. It's the type of emotion that you are glad to have felt because it enriches your life and makes you understand your fellow man better.<br/><br/>My understanding is that, like every movie that's ""based on a true story"" they take some liberties to make the film more coherent and dramatic, particularly during the moments between King and then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. I didn't care, and you shouldn't care because you shouldn't be basing your history reports (or book reports for that matter) on films. If you want the facts, you go to the library. If you want to be entertained, go watch the movie.<br/><br/>Within ""Selma"" are some powerful and scathing reviews of the politicians at the time. The people in power at Selma, most notably Alabama Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) are very satisfyingly exposed for the brutish trilobites that they were. Are the portrayals exaggerated? I don't feel like they were (Except as I mentioned before when it comes to the President). The facts are that crimes against African-Americans were being committed and that no one was doing anything about it until the people who were being oppressed rose up. Even then they were met with senseless opposition from devils who hated them solely because of the color of their skin. I found myself feeling white-hot hatred towards the spineless, dust-brained sons of jackals who dared to stand up against people simply trying to exercise their rights as ordinary citizens. Fortunately for me, and for those that were being oppressed, we are having the last laugh by seeing this film. History will remember them for what they are, and their legacies will only be one of hatred. Their names have become a curse to be thrown at the lowest of bottom-feeders and the most ignorant half-wits that barely qualify as ""living"". In that sense, I have gotten my revenge against them and boy am I glad.<br/><br/>I love watching a movie with powerful emotions because it makes me feel alive. It's the opposite of watching something as awful as ""The Boy Next Door"", which made me want to cease existing out of embarrassment for the human race. This is a movie that makes you feel. It will shock you, it will make you feel sad and angry, but it also makes you feel empowered. I left the theater invigorated, ready to take on the injustices of the world and determined to do something with my freedom to give the rest of humanity the same joys that I experience and take for granted every day. A big portion of the power of this piece is due to the transcendent performances on display. David Oyelowo as King is particularly powerful and nearly out shadows everyone else involved. It's the kind of powerhouse display of acting that knocks you off your feet it's so good, because it feels so genuine. I want to stress that this movie would have been good solely because of the subject matter, but it's the performances and the tangible dedication of Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Keith Stanfield, Lorraine Toussaint and everyone else involved. There is not a moment where the film feels artificial or false, and for that I give praise to director Ava DuVernay.<br/><br/>I can't think of anyone that shouldn't see this movie. Even if you extensively researched the events portrayed in the film and wrote a book about them, I think there are some things here that would powerfully resonate with you (you'll have to forgive the exaggerated events and character though). ""Selma"" is easily one of the best movies of the year, and it still would be if it was just David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King, Jr. ordering a slice of pie at a diner. He is that good.

Of course, we are all aware that there still exists some racial injustices, but things don't change overnight. They take time. We have an African-American president - who would have thought that even ten years ago??? We shouldn't dwell too much on our failures, but look at how far we've come. There's still a lot to do. This is a must-see movie. A great man with great dignity. A true visionary who was sadly taken too soon.

"lucasnochez","9","1","3","13 February 2015"," Film Review: Selma/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","There are certain people and events throughout history that are so obviously in need of a cinematic treatment, that their absence from the big screen leaves audiences wondering what on earth took so long. Such is the case with the one of the most recognizable and referenced figures in Western society, Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. This larger than life individual whose life and accomplishments are far too grand for a simple studio feature film, has luckily never been subjected to an impoverished movie. Instead, Dr. King is assimilated as a key figure in Ava DeVernay's re-telling of the events in Selma, Alabama. DeVernay illustrates the movement organized by Dr. King which brought to light the fact that although African American's (predominantly in the South) had the constitutional right to vote, they had not seen a registered vote cast for over sixty years. Just like the events that unfolded throughout the worldwide broadcasting of Bloody Sunday, the march in Selma was a fair catalyst to the establishment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a bill that gave all Americans equal opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. <br/><br/>It is without a doubt that MLK is an influential figure who sadly suffered the same tragic fate of other great American figures including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. This doom alone could easily make for an explosive and easily appealing studio film for large audiences. Though, what detaches Selma from other biopics and sets it up amongst the greats, like Steven Spielberg's recent Lincoln, is its focus on a specific period in time; allowing the events and characters to unfold in fine cinematic fashion around these prevalent historical shifts on the world. Biopics may not be the go-to genre for spoilers, twist-endings, and large box-offices, but movies like Selma reaffirm the fine tailored approach of filmmakers looking to retell the milestones of world history and offer exceptional character insight on the visionaries we have immortalized.<br/><br/>Selma may seem too daunting to many, serving more of a history lesson with real violent historical events‚Äìthat is Bloody Sunday, than an entertaining piece of film discouraging potential viewers. Instead, the film chronicles both the violent and peaceful moments of the period with COMPLETE eloquence and patience, allowing Selma to become one of the most vivid and colourful history lessons we have seen on screen in a long time. More than anything, Selma depicts an important piece of American history for a time that needs reaffirmed confidence and faith in the goodness and changes people are willing to make everyday.<br/><br/>Timely in its fashion for the current events plaguing the United States today, the film is a heavy- handed, dramatic and necessary piece of cinematic awareness for a country whose civil views have not changed much for almost fifty years. Scarily mimicking the events of Ferguson, Mo. and the current issues circling America, Selma becomes a contemporary mandatory viewing for all people‚Äìof all race and colour.<br/><br/>Director DuVernay, approaches a monumental cinematic achievement with many obstacles. Wishes of Dr. King's kin that DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb not incorporate any original speeches left the film's representation of the most pivotal character with the potential lack of authenticity.<br/><br/>Overcoming this, DuVernay and Webb stray away from the monumental ""I Have A Dream"" speech, as well as the obvious tragedy of Dr.King's assassination, instead displaying a relatable leader with humanistic flaws: characteristics many would otherwise be oblivious to. On top of the film's apparent issues of gaining rights from Dr. King's family (similar to All Is By My Side and the music of Jimi Hendrix), the film also endured a strenuous identity crisis, with the possibility of being helmed by the likes of; Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann, Spike Lee, Paul Haggis, Stephen Frears (attached with Oyelowo to star), and Lee Daniels fresh off of his other civil rights film The Butler. Yet, easily foreseeable by her previous delicate work I Will Follow and Middle of Nowhere, no one seems more qualified or destined to bring life to the events of Selma than DuVernay; a- once resident of Alabama herself and a director whose voice and view of the eventful day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge changed the United States and its people forever.<br/><br/>Never constraining itself to the obvious location, Selma also offers insight to the importance of ego and its development into its own character in the lives of the Selma marchers. Shutting great men down permanently and unequivocally through scenes of extreme prejudice, racism and struggle, characters such as President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), CIA founder J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), and Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) give depth to the many facets of politics and the agendas of men throughout that time, and their priorities to the American people. Seeing such amazing talent in one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Dr.King's interactions with elite politicians (most specifically those with Wilkinson, who offers some of his best recent work since Michael Clayton) shines.<br/><br/>Yet, no matter how big the name or actor is, some of the best scenes of the film are those with the less recognizable figures during the civil rights movement; including a scene between a grieving Cager Lee Jackson PLAYED by Henry G. Sanders (father of the slain Jimmi Lee Jackson PLAYED by Short Term 12's Keith Stanfield) as well as a quietly insightful yet tremendously uplifting scene between Dr.King and a then John Lewis (played by star-in-the-making Toronto native Stephan James)."

","Having successfully had anti-segregation laws passed, black Americans discover that they are being denied the right to vote in Alabama so, led by Dr Martin Luthor King, a peaceful protest march is planned from Selma to Montgomery. However, the powers that be do not want this march to take place.<br/><br/>This reconstruction tells the story of an important but little known (outside the USA, at any rate) incident in the path of the 1960s civil rights movement. I am always wary of films which fall into the category which I mentally call ""worthy"" because that often means that they are so referential to the event/s they are depicting that they forget that they also have a need to engage the audience. Selma does not make this mistake ‚Äì it is engaging throughout.<br/><br/>It is also both inspiring and sobering ‚Äì to learn of the deaths that occurred, solely because people of colour wanted to be able to exercise the rights they had been fighting for over such a long time and to see, so well portrayed, the hatefulness they faced as well as the determinedly peaceful yet implacable way that fight was fought is to have one's (white, English, middle class) eyes opened somewhat.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a worthy film, but it works well as a film of general appeal, too."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","3","12 February 2015"," DuVernay delivers a gripping and powerful biopic
","""Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe.""<br/><br/>Martin Luther King is a very popular figure, so the biggest risk for a biopic like this is simply retelling a familiar story, which is what most directors do turning films like this into history lessons. You are sort of expecting this inspiring and uplifting film that will have its emotional moments once King stands up and delivers his world famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, but Ava DuVernay takes an entirely different approach. Instead of following a timeline and going through important dates in King's life she simply introduces us to an important and defining moment in his life. And by doing this DuVernay allows us to center on the person that King was, learning about his struggles, fears, and so on. King is portrayed in a different and more humane light and isn't simply a figure we idolize. It is something similar to what Spielberg did with Lincoln, but much more engaging this time. DuVernay is able to avoid falling into biopic genre conventions and centers the narrative on King's efforts to organize a march in Selma in order to secure equal voting rights for all. In the large context it might just have been a short period in his life, but by focusing on this specific and detailed event we are able to learn who King was and how he was able to face each obstacle. It also reminds us that organizing a march isn't as simple as one can imagine. In a general biopic about Martin Luther King this would simply take about five minutes, but here we get the specifics which at the same time allows us to learn the importance of what King was fighting for while we also get to finally see him portrayed with some depth. DuVernay was robbed by the Academy from a Best Director nod because she crafted a powerful film avoiding familiar clich√©s and melodrama.<br/><br/>Selma gets about everything right: the script by Paul Webb is solid and there are some fantastic dialogues and speeches throughout the film, the cinematography by Bradford Young is sharp, and the production design transports us to the 60's in a very authentic way. But the film wouldn't have worked without the right actor to play Martin Luther King. David Oyelowo delivers one of my favorite performances of the year as King. His transformation is impressive. Not for a second did I think that this was an actor playing the famous figure. Oyelowo is like a chameleon, able to transform from one movie to the next. This is a completely different person from the actor who played Yardley in The Paperboy. He portrayed King in a very different light from what we are used to seeing him. We've all seen and heard King deliver his speeches and Oyelowo personifies him in the same way with similar tones and pauses. But it is in the smaller moments where Oyelowo's subtle performance stands out as he shines a more humane light on King, reflecting some of his fears and doubts as he second guesses himself at times. There are quiet moments where he doesn't know what to say or how to react to situations. There is a scene where he has to comfort a family who has lost their son, and he seems to be lost for words. He also shares some great scenes with Carmen Ejogo who plays his wife, and Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson. The supporting performances are also strong as several popular and historical figures pop into the movie. Tim Roth delivers one of my favorite supporting performances as Gov. George Wallace, but many more stand out as well. Selma is a gripping film beautifully directed by DuVernay with a wonderful and memorable performance from Oyelowo."

","This film is so not clich√©d, not didactic, not manipulative, not Oscar-bait I couldn't believe I was finally seeing a historic movie about this subject matter done right after last year's disappointments in ""The Butler"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" (yes! I found 12 years to be good but nothing more).<br/><br/>I was moved to genuine tears about ten times in Selma and they always came from the most intimate and small moments. Finally a movie that understands (like this year's ""Imitation Game"") that pulling on your heartstrings with self set up moments that scream at you to cry and to be moved without having built up any emotional core with honesty, don't work (I am looking at you 12 years)! The beauty of how laid back, but powerful the film is, wow, it reaches a balance of emotions that is truly remarkable. Hats off to Ava Duvarney for making very conscious and smart decisions that really came through screen and were definitely helped by a brilliant and very dense screenplay by Webb and a very, very magnificent photography. This film really has shots that even if deprived of their emotional resonance would have left my mouth open. Obviously, the cast has to be acknowledged for their flawless work Tom Wilkinson really shines, but David Oyelowo. My god what a performance to behold. He transitions into this real life character perfectly and makes it his own. Just wow, I am really wordless. Very good use of music by the way and amazing original song: ""Glory"".<br/><br/>Despite all this amazing stuff there is one simple thing that doesn't work in the film. It repeatedly has some moments in which it seems to turn off and drag. They are really out of nowhere because as soon as they stop you are back in it and riveted, but in more occasions it seemed like the director went to take a nap and left the actors direct themselves without even following a plan. It was really weird because there were these moments where it seemed I was bored, but then forgot about them until the next one came on. There aren't really a lot , but they really stuck out.<br/><br/>I struggled so much to give a grade to this movie, it is right nearly there at 8.5, but misses it by a hair for me, it just missed that kick to make me go ""whoa"" after the credits rolled, but I left the theater truly inspired and feeling like the two hours spent in the cinema where really, really worth it."

From the off this is one of those super substantial films that everyone should go and see regardless of race or nationality, because it's a film about fighting for what's rightfully yours in a completely peaceful, non-violent manner.

","Ava DuVernay's retelling of the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery is an elegant, well-crafted film that, while breaking no new ground (and seeming to contradict well-researched data on Martin Luther King's relationship with Lyndon Johnson), is subtly moving. Like Dr. King, DuVernay prefers to work with words rather than depend on visuals and the result is a series of quiet, well-reasoned arguments (the articulate screenplay is by Paul Webb) that bring out the dignity of the topics and of the performers; when the necessary counterpoint of violence is shown, it only serves to underscore the importance of the discussions and DuVarny smartly keeps these sequences short. As a director, she makes good choices, preferring to film in the familiar sepia tones that we seem to associate with the civil rights movement (the cinematography is by Bradord Young); and she knows when to closely involve us (with the use of hand-held cameras) and when to wisely stay out of the way in order to let her performers shine--which they do, particularly David Oyelowo as King and Carmen Ejogo as his wife. They get so lost in the characters you can't help but be pulled in; one focus of the film is on the stress that the movement places on their marriage and the actors' convincing ability to unify on every level is one of the film's quiet triumphs. ""Selma"" is a labor of love for DuVernay and while her facts may be questionable, as a filmmaker, she gets it right."

There were no nominations for best director or best movie and in fact for the first time in decades all of the Academy Awards were as lily white as the management structures of the big movie studios. Others thought President Lyndon B. Johnson didn't get a fair shake since he was presented as the target that SCLC and the protesters were trying to leverage, but I have no sympathy for those folks trying to take away credit from the role of movements, organizers, and people on the ground. Others just want to confuse art with history, and I'm not willing to go there either, but I will say that Selma is a movie worth the price and invaluable for organizers' eyes and work.<br/><br/>There's one scene among many that should be clipped out and required viewing for organizers. It occurs when Martin Luther King to huge drama, cameras rolling, and a march column filled behind him with many people, including religious who had answered his call for help, stops the march coming over the bridge and stares down at the Alabama state troopers and Sheriff Jim Clark's deputies amassed in a phalanx and the bottom of the bridge. Suddenly the police break ranks and line the sides of the road to let them go. King just stares down silently for a while seemingly trying to figure out what to do. He then takes a knee on the bridge, followed by everyone behind him in the march, and bows his head to pray. He says nothing to his comrades and other march leaders. He stands. He stares. Then he turns silently and walks back through the crowd, returning to Selma and leaving the police watching their back. This is not movie time fiction, though it may not follow reality exactly.<br/><br/>This is one of organizing history's great teachable moments. Clearly King and the SCLC leadership and march organizers had seemingly dropped the ball in their preparations. In the polarized campaign in Selma, Alabama, they had neglected to discuss how to respond to the tactical situation if the police yielded the highway. They were already under a court order not to march to Montgomery, which they were disobeying already on the bridge. In the debriefing later with the key leaders and organizers of the march there is heated disagreement over King's turnaround. He argues they were not prepared to go to Montgomery with supplies and logistics and that he feared a bloodbath in a trap. His loyalists argue ""my King, right or wrong."" King has his say and walks out of the room.<br/><br/>The movie-makers want the viewer to puzzle over whether or not King made the right call there and in the follow-up make believe argument between the character of John Lewis and the character of his SNCC colleague try to put a finger on the scale so that the viewer might side with King. The organizer has to wonder though. If King and SCLC had never discussed the possibility that the police might yield, what were they thinking? If they were not prepared to go to Montgomery once they got to the bottom of the bridge, then what was the point of the march? If it had been planned as a symbolic protest and passive civil disobedience at the bottom of the bridge, then why were the leaders arguing in disagreement? King could have simply turned, said that they had made their point, and would come back later and march to Montgomery as advertised. There's nothing in the movie or in many descriptions of this part of Selma and the battles over Pettus Bridge that indicates that this was the plan. If it were not part of the plan, then what was the point? Was it to provoke more bloodshed, regardless of King's expression of fear about that in the movie? Often in training organizers we use the Melian debate. Pettus Bridge and this slice of the movie might be an even better case study.<br/><br/>I should stop here but let me add a couple of other observations. Another slice I would clip out of the film for organizers would focus on the camaraderie of the SCLC team. That rings true and speaks to the community that organizers build and is at the heart of the work. I liked Roy Reed from the New York Times getting a positive, minor role. He wrote the first piece about ACORN for the Times in the 1970s. It was good to see other veterans of the movement when they were about the movement and later comrades in the work.<br/><br/>And, finally if anyone was ever to have been nominated for anything in this movie, it would be Henry Sanders in the role of the 82-year old Cager Lee outside the window of the morgue, mourning the death of his grandson in the first battle of the bridge, and talking to Dr. King. The expressions on his face during this short interlude and his acting spoke to hundreds of years of oppression, struggle, and hope more genuinely than anything I've ever seen on film.<br/><br/>See it for yourself. - See more at: http://chieforganizer.org/#sthash.kV5b65yW.dpuf"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","1","3","31 January 2015"," Very powerful film - highly recommended!
","One of my history teachers once called Martin Luther King the ""sacred cow"" of the Civil Rights movement ‚Äì an almost mythological figure. I would go so far as to say that the whole civil rights era has been sanitized to the point where the oppression of African Americans in the Jim Crow South almost doesn't feel real. But Ava DuVernay's Selma brings this era to life again. She succeeds because she does not shy away from the darker side of this era while delivering a riveting and moving picture. <br/><br/>The film begins with Martin Luther King's acceptance speech of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, a sort of ivory tower secluded from the real action. But DuVernay quickly brings us back into the real world by depicting the bombing of an African-American church in Birmingham Alabama where four children were killed. The scene packs a major emotional wallop, giving the audience a sense of the frankly barbaric oppression of African Americans in the Jim Crow South better than any Nobel Prize speech (or history textbook) can convey. <br/><br/>The movie then turns to a woman named Annie Lee Cooper, played by Oprah Winfrey, attempting to register to vote in Selma. The government employee subjects her to a ridiculous quiz on irrelevant facts that everybody would fail. Needless to say, her application is denied. <br/><br/>It is in the face of this brutal violence and the violation of constitutional rights that King asks for the help of President Lyndon Baines Johnson in passing a Voting Rights Act, but Johnson wants to focus on desegregation and poverty. King won't budge on the voting issue and decides to organize a march on Selma Alabama in protest.<br/><br/>From here, Selma focuses on three key relationships in Martin Luther King's life ‚Äì his relationship with his wife, Coretta, his relationship with Lyndon B. Johnson, and his relationship with civil rights organizations. All of them are rife with complications ‚Äì his wife is understandably concerned about his safety, LBJ does not want to move as fast as King on voting rights, and King's organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, disagrees amongst themselves and with the student group Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) over tactics and strategy. But they all push forward, and unless you live under a rock, you know the Voting Rights Act eventually passed. <br/><br/>The heart and soul of the movie is King's relationship with the civil rights organizations themselves. From the arguments over tactics and safety to the camaraderie between members, Selma portrays the inner workings of these organizations and the painful struggles they endure. The most harrowing moments are the conflicts between marchers and the police. The authorities were not merciful - they brutally beat men and women indiscriminately. The most moving scene for me was the murder of a black protester named Billie Lee Jackson by the police. Jackson and his family participated in a protest march that the police broke up. Jackson, his wife, and his father try to hide in a restaurant, but the police hunt them down, and during the fight Billie Lee is shot and killed. <br/><br/>This sequence was particularly moving because it integrated the civil rights movement with the aftermath of the Civil War and the shootings of young black kids in the present. King visits Jackson's grandfather Cager Lee in the coroner's office to console him. During their conversation, Cager Lee tells King that he was born in 1882 and his family always said he would be the first in his family to vote. King then delivers a powerful speech at Jackson's funeral, placing responsibility for the youth's death on the white people that support discrimination and the African-Americans that do not join in the movement. The link to the post Civil War era is rather overt with the inclusion of Cager Lee, but you would have to be extremely ignorant of current events to not notice the parallels between the excessive force of the police in the 60's with the excessive force of today's police. Selma's juxtaposition of the civil rights movement between these two eras rightly frames it as part of a struggle that is ongoing rather than finished. That, I think, is its greatest achievement. <br/><br/>The movie has good performances all around. David Oyelowo does a respectable job portraying MLK as a burdened but resolute leader. He has good chemistry with Carmen Ejogo, who plays Coretta Scott King. Tim Roth plays an especially loathsome George Wallace, the Governor of Alabama who famously said ""segregation now, segregation forever."" I wasn't too enamored with Tom Wilkinson as LBJ ‚Äì he's a good actor, but he didn't seem like LBJ to me. <br/><br/>The stars of this movie though are the unseen director, Ava DuVernay, and the writer, Paul Webb, who took an often sanitized piece of history and made it seem real to viewers, a very difficult task. I wish DuVernay had been nominated for an Oscar for best director. <br/><br/>DuVernay shows that the Jim Crow south was truly a tyranny on this earth. More importantly, Selma is part of a relatively recent trend in Hollywood to make African Americans the central focus of civil rights stories that are often told through the perspective of white people (The Help, Mississippi Burning, Glory, Ghosts of Mississippi, and plenty more). Selma helps us appreciate the very real dangers that the civil rights movement faced and it helps us respect its participants even more."

","Audiences that don't know a lot about Civil Rights history during the turbulent 1960s may have trouble appreciating ""Selma,"" with David Oyelowo as Baptist minister and social activist Reverend Martin Luther King. ""Middle of Nowhere"" director Ava DuVernay's evocative historical drama about Dr. King's protest march in that same Alabama town benefits chiefly from first-rate performances, a gifted cast, and some devastating scenes about the reprisals that African-Americans and white faced in the struggle for African-American voting rights equality. Nevertheless, as good as it is, ""Selma"" is not without blemishes. This loquacious, often artistically uneven melodrama suffers from slow pacing and inaccurate history. Unfortunately, DuVernay and freshman scenarist Paul Webb have tampered with history to make their points. Primarily, ""Selma"" pits Martin Luther King against U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in several Oval Office confrontations, and many historians have taken the filmmakers to task for this ham-fisted blunder. Andrew Young, one of Dr. King's chief advisors during those fateful days, has gone on record about the relationship that existed between MLK and LBJ. In Young's own words, ""He (LBJ) and Martin never had that kind of confrontation."" Undeniably, ""Selma"" qualifies as a significant motion picture largely because Martin Luther King dominates the action. British actor David Oyelowo delivers a sterling performance as King that depicts his dedication to and compassion for equal rights for African Americans. Previously, most Civil Rights era films have confined King to the periphery, among them Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X,"" Richard Pearce's ""The Long Walk Home,"" and Richard LaGravenese's ""Freedom Riders."" The three-part, television miniseries ""King"" (1978) has been the only biography with any substance about the slain Civil Rights leader. Although Oyelowo carries the weight of the film on his shoulders, several other performances cannot be ignored, including Tom Wilkinson's earthy portrayal of Johnson, Carmen Ejogo as King's long-suffering wife Coretta Scott King, and Oprah Winfrey as tenacious voting rights protester Annie Cooper who refused to give up in her efforts to register so she could vote. Ultimately, the thing that makes ""Selma"" a memorable is the history that it painstakingly recreates at some of the actual settings, particular the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite its flaws and its largely conventional approach, ""Selma"" deserves to be seen because it chronicles how far America came in race relations during the 1960s and also how much farther we as a country must go to maintain equality.<br/><br/>My chief complaint about ""Selma"" is the filmmakers' casual regard about the use of history. Scenarist Paul Webb and director Ava DuVernay must have believed that audiences had an adequate knowledge about the Civil Rights movement. After the film opens with Dr. King receiving the Nobel Peace award, ""Selma"" takes a moment to show the explosion that claimed the lives of four adolescent African American girls at the 16th Street Birmingham Church in 1963. We're told little about this tragic incident before Webb and DuVernay plunge us into King's first strategy session with his lieutenants about a suitable place to launch their next protest. King wants to know if Selma Sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston of ""Devil's Knot"") behaves more like Birmingham Police Chief Bull Connor or Albany, Georgia, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett. You have to know something about King's unsuccessful Albany protest to understand why they talk about Pritchett. Police Chief Pritchett and his deputies did not resort to the same kind of brutal violence that Birmingham Police Chief Bull Connor wielded when he turned loose snarling dogs on African Americans and flattened them with blasts of water from fire hoses. Because Pritchett did not rely on violence, Dr. King's Albany protest generated little media coverage. Interestingly enough, at one point, King even put the protest movement on hold so Pritchett could take time off to celebrate a wedding anniversary with his wife! <br/><br/>Meantime, the struggles African Americans contended with in Selma are shown in vivid detail. Initially, Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey of ""The Butler"") tried to register at the Selma court house, but the obnoxious Registrar (Clay Chappell of ""Footloose"") thwarted her at every turn. Later, after Dr. King and his lieutenants arrived in town, they discussed the ways that white officials intimidated African Americans from registering to vote. Poll taxes, civics tests, the requirement that an actual voter vouch for them, and lastly the publishing of one's name and address in the newspaper if one managed to register were used routinely to discourage African Americans from registering. Getting one's name in the newspaper served as an open invitation to either losing one's job or being beaten up, shot at, and/or fire-bombed. The first Selma march that occurred while Dr. King was absent qualifies as the most frightening. Sheriff Clark's deputies waded into the marchers and attacked them with clubs lashed with barbed wire, and they beat the living daylights out of anybody. Earlier, when Annie Lee Cooper assaulted the pot-bellied Clark at the court house, white lawmen had piled ont0 her without restraint, and they arrested anybody who had participated in the protest. The most tragic moments occurred during a night march when Dr. King was absent again and Alabama State Troopers murdered a young African American. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, all too often, ""Selma"" degenerates into great men arguing in rooms. Dr. King and his advisors argue; Dr. King and LBJ argue, and LBJ and segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace argue. Although scenarist Paul Webb and director Ava DuVernay present Dr. King as a fully rounded individual, they make LBJ and Wallace look like caricatures. Most of ""Selma"" details the strategy Dr. King and his adversaries adopted during their crusade. Only when DuVernay stages physical scenes without chatter does she hammer home her salient points. Eventually, African Americans triumphed because they recruited liberal white supporters. The scene where racist rednecks assault a white Boston priest and beat him to death is chilling. As a stirring historical drama about our controversial past, ""Selma"" is a must-see movie, particularly if you know little about Martin Luther King."

","This film tells the story of the revered human rights activist's journey to secure equal voting rights for people the USA.<br/><br/>""Selma"" tells the touching story of Martin Luther King's peaceful fight for a basic human right. The film sets the scene by detailing how African Americans were treated differentially in Alabama, and they did not get equal rights compared to whites. Martin Luther King's speeches are very powerful and effective. As Martin Luther King's movement continued, more incidents of appalling injustice are depicted. These horrific incidents are almost unimaginable these days, so it is very frightening to be confronted with the fact that these true events occurred only a generation ago.<br/><br/>""Selma"" effectively touches the hearts of viewers, not only because it is well done, but because it deals with an issue that is fundamental and close to everyone.

"DareDevilKid","9","1","3","18 January 2015"," A King-Size Movie and a King-Size Performance for a King-Size Historical Figure
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.6/5 stars<br/><br/>Fueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, ""Selma"" draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. while also not ignoring how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied. The movie manages to beautifully articulate a pivotal moment in history ‚Äì one that is hauntingly ironic in how it echoes our current times and society. It's a blast of piercing social insight expressed through exquisite craftsmanship by Director, Ava DuVernay (unpardonably robbed of a Best Director nomination at this year's Oscars), which makes it feel like art and not bald-faced messaging. On top of all of its many other virtues, ""Selma"" is an inspiring movie about politics and a large-scale human movement done right. A masterclass in directing, the film is a gripping, hard-hitting, and moving depiction of events in early 1965 as it chronicles Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.<br/><br/>What's absolutely credible about the film is that it focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King ‚Äì his doubts ‚Äì and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance. He completely disappears into the persona of Martin Luther ‚Äì diction, body language, oratory skills and all. Oyelowo's breakout performance should have rightly earned him an Oscar nomination (another major snub for this film). Nevertheless, it will be remembered by film lovers around the world for years to come. A number of historical dramas fall into the trap of sugar- coating the details of their subject matter in order to stress the qualities of their main protagonist. ""Selma"" does not display any such shortcoming as it refreshingly presents its main character as a flawed but inspirational figure. Cracking the civil rights leader and his associates from their plaster-saint cocoons, this latest offering on a one of Martin Luther's many emphatic triumphs presents a multidimensional portrayal of Dr. King, flaws and all, and succinctly demonstrates that we've both come a long way and have a long way to go. What makes the film ‚Äì and a few of its shortcomings ‚Äì such a vital work is how relevant its depiction of the events of 50 years ago are to today. While Oyelowo grabs this richly-scripted character by the scruff of its neck and leads the way, he's marvelously supported by a talented bunch of supporting cast members. The camaraderie and heated arguments demonstrated by the large and impressive ensemble of African-American character actors, beautifully capture the essence of the personalities and issues of those times.<br/><br/>Politics, segregation, and basic human rights, are just a few themes explored throughout this film, and all are done to pure perfection. Films about black rights have had highs and lows through the years, from being preachy to monotonous to breezily entertaining to just missing the mark to downright awful. ""Selma"" is among the few that falls in that rarest of rare categories of being truly incredible. Uniquely filmed, superbly written, and downright enthralling, this picture is one for the ages. I felt myself immersed in the lives of this group of individuals as they fought to earn respect and start a revolution. Inspiring, heart-pumping, and thought-provoking, ""Selma"" delivers the raw emotion many films lack these days, and for that, I can't give it enough credit. I was moved from beginning to end ‚Äì the film is nothing short of being breathtaking. It's not just required viewing because it addresses issues that unfortunately exist in contemporary society; it's required viewing because it's a freaking fantastic film.<br/><br/>As the 50th anniversary of the events it depicts approaches, ""Selma"" feels chillingly contemporary, all too real, and monumental in more ways than one. Almost half a century since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill giving everyone the unquestionable right to vote, America and several other nations are still struggling with similar issues today. How is that even possible? It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much- needed wake-up-call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality. For this reason alone, such a phenomenally stirring production should be seen by everyone who believes in racial equality, and even more so by anyone who doesn't. Inspiring and impassioned, ""Selma"" has the power to enrage and enlighten while delivering Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's reverberating message of perseverance of the human spirit."

","This movie takes place in the 1960s and is about the black civil rights movement that was led by Dr. Martin Luther King. His role in this movement was very important as he led to success. He used non violent and peaceful protests to get things done. I think this was the right decision because many people would think African Americans are dangerous and violent if they acted in a violent protest it wouldn't be as successful as it was. This part of history was very important and I am glad it happend back then so we can all be equal today. This movie did a very good job showing the hatred and disrespect that the black people were faced with everyday constantly being told they couldn't do certain things. Overall this movie was really good and is very powerful to see dr king lead a movement with such power and determination."

"paul2001sw-1","8","1","4","5 October 2017"," A struggle in microcosm
","The metaphorical march to justice is a slow one; but a significant step was taken on an actual march, from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama in 1965, when a public protest triggered action that finally allowed black Americans to vote, after many years in which they had been prevented from doing so. You could hardly go wrong in telling this story, a microcosm of the broader civil rights campaign: in this drama, you have many of the major figures in the wider battle: George Wallace, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, and of course, the charismatic Martin Luther King, who naturally takes centre stage in this movie. He's quite well brought to life by David Olelowo, who certainly looks the part and acts it convincingly (though the film mostly elides his private life). Tom Wilkinson is slightly less successful as Johnson, a more generic politician than the larger-than-life figure who emerges from Robert Caro's biography. Even though the narrative is straightforward: a fierce and violent struggle, then the good guys win, there's still something very moving when the story reaches its conclusion. But in the age of 'Black Lives Matter' and the presidency of Donald Trump, maybe also shocking at how much still needs to be done."
"lesleyharris30","9","1","4","21 May 2016"," Powerful, Entirely Uplifted by Oyelowo,
","Selma is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast. It's a powerful, engaging story as we follow the life of historical icon Martin Luther King Jr. as he leads the march from Selma to Montgomery, tracing this man's braveness, courage and sheer dedication to give his race the freedom they deserve. I was, however, disappointed that the film did not contain King's world famous ""I Have A Dream"" speech, I get that the events are set afterwards, but it would have been a great way to open the movie, and not getting David Oyelowo to deliver it was a huge missed opportunity. The cast is all around terrific, such as Tom Willinson, Carmen Ejogo and Tim Roth, but the majority of praise must go to Oyelowo, chronicling the emotion and passion of this man to perfection, he is completely transformed, delivering a stunning, underrated performance. Uplifting, powerful and very engaging, Selma is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>Martin Luther King Jr. struggles to fight for equal voting rights for the African American race. <br/><br/>Best Performance: David Oyelowo"
"joegmitt","10","1","4","5 April 2015"," Bringing you back to the civil rights movement
","When i first went to see this movie, i was skeptical on how good the movie was going to be. Most people know the story of Selma or at least heard of the assault of the men and women on that infamous bridge as well as the struggle for voting rights in the south for blacks. However, when I started watching the film, my first instincts were quickly proved wrong; the beginning scene, where the young girls were killed by a bombing came as a shock but it kept me watching up until the end. The way the director portrayed the Doctors struggles at home gave me a new outlook on Martin Luther king's life and how much he really did sacrifice for the cause of civil rights for blacks. the violence in the movie was not gruesome, but gave you a clear understanding on the pure hate that some of these people had towards blacks in the south. All in all, the movie was perfectly crafted to bring you back to the fight for civil rights."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","28 February 2015"," The Academy were wrong to overlook this fine film
","As a result of a trip to Africa, it was a few days after the Academy Awards 2015 ceremony before I was able to see ""Selma"". It was terribly unfair that David Oyelowo's commanding performance as Dr Martin Luther King Jr did not obtain a nomination for Best Actor but at least ""Glory"" - the moving piece that accompanies the film's credits - won the Best Song award. This is not a bio-pic but instead an examination of a short but seminal time in King's struggle for civil rights and specifically the right of African- Americans to vote, so the three Selma to Montgomery marches of March 1965 come after the ""I have a dream"" speech in Washington DC in 1963 and before the assassination in Memphis 1968.<br/><br/>""Selma"" is no Hollywood blockbuster: the budget was a mere $20M, the director Ava DuVernay is a black woman whose previous work was mostly in television, and there are no big name American actors on show. Three key roles went to fine British actors: Oyelowo himself and Tom Wilkinson as President Johnson and Tim Roth as Governor Wallace, while Oprah Winfrey has a small but pivotal appearance. In all the circumstances, therefore, it is a real achievement that the movie was made at all and that it is so good.<br/><br/>A major problem in representing such an iconic figure as Dr King and such a noble cause as the civil rights movement is how honest to make the narrative. King is revealed as an adulterer and a leader who sometimes made decisions which many followers found hard to comprehend, while the film shows a little of the divisions in the movement, notably between the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Overall, however, this is an inspirational film that uncomfortably holds up a mirror to contemporary America where voting rights are still being circumscribed and blacks are still being beaten and shot by the agents of law enforcement."

","Sometimes you have to hand it to Oprah Winfrey. She can be preachy, she can pull your heartstrings so hard they nearly snap, and her sentimentality at times rivals that of German kitsch. But with ""Selma,"" she has given us a moving and powerful morality story about the power of perseverance. Do not miss this film.<br/><br/>""Selma"" tells the story of a high mark in the career of Martin Luther King, Jr., the famous march from Selma, Alabama to the capital in Montgomery in support of equal voting rights ‚Äì something we badly need reminding, given Republican efforts at voter suppression and a Republican Supreme Court which supports that suppression. I suspect that King today would be more vocal than ever were he alive.<br/><br/>What ""Selma"" tells us is that things haven't changed very much. Yes, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did grant equal protection for all Americans, regardless of ancestry. And, ever since, conservatives have been trying to water it down; they just can't be blatant about it anymore. It's not just insane requirements of the sort the Act sought to strike down resurfacing. When you consider that one in three black men will go to jail at some point in his life, and that convicted felons lose the right to vote, it adds up to a significant dilution of the black vote. It's clear that the fight is not over.<br/><br/>As King, David Oyelowo is truly astonishing. He doesn't attempt to imitate King; a classically trained stage actor, he finds the man's character in all its humanity, and it shows. His King isn't an inspiring Superman leading the movement without a slip. His King connives with the best of them, and he makes mistakes. One marvelous moment is the fear evident in King's eyes as one of the marches is about to start. You can almost see the words ""What the hell are we doing?"" in his eyes. In a scene that could be a textbook for actors, King and his wife, Coretta (the pitch perfect Carmen Ejogo) face a marital crisis, and in that moment, King is as humbled as the rest of us when faced with the choice of losing his wife and family or fulfilling his mission. In fact, there is not a single bad or weak performance in the entire film.<br/><br/>I've got to give some credit to Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth as President Lyndon Johnson and Governor George Wallace, respectively. Both men are very accomplished actors. Wilkinson plays Johnson as the wheeler- dealer he actually was, the man who (almost) always gets his way. There is considerable irony when King visits Johnson in his office; a portrait of Andrew Jackson, easily America's most racist president, looks over Johnson's shoulder much of the time. <br/><br/>In real life George Wallace was a hateful, repulsive leech, but Tim Roth gives him some humanity. His Wallace just can't understand why black people are demanding their rights. In his view, they've gotten along just fine without them for hundreds of years. It's not just racism; Roth's Wallace really can't understand what's going on.<br/><br/>I'm surprised I had not heard of Ava DuVernay before this. According to IMDb, she has spent most of her career as a publicist and documentary director. But she is the only black female director to win Best Director at the Sundance film festival (2012). DuVernay is now a front-rank film director. If she continues in this vein, she has a great career ahead of her.<br/><br/>I guarantee you won't easily forget the first five minutes of this film. The scenes actually filmed in Selma are uncanny, as if these events were taking place today. DuVernay obviously knows how to get the best from her actors.<br/><br/>That there are no acting or directing Academy Award nominations for ""Selma"" is an artistic crime. How can you pick a film for Best Picture without acknowledging the people who made it? The sad thing is, I don't think it was conscious on the part of Academy voters. The Oscars are as political as anything else requiring a vote, and I think the mostly white Academy voters voted for their pocketbooks and their friends. Merit does not win as often as it should.<br/><br/>At its best, ""Selma"" shows what we can accomplish by simply never giving up and standing resolute. Given the craven nature of the human soul, this is a valuable reminder."
"therocksbarneyreviews","9","1","4","7 February 2015"," David Oyelowo finally grants Dr. Martin Luther King the cinematic justice he deserves in ""Selma""
","There are moments in ""Selma"" when I felt like I was watching Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (played brilliantly by David Oyelowo) himself speaking on screen. Moments that made me want to clap my hands and stand up and cheer in approval of what he was saying. Moments when I was having to hold tears back. And these moments have stayed with me a couple of days after watching the film. These moments prove how timeless the story and issues are that ""Selma"" presents to us and although it would be difficult not to get these across, ""Selma"" does so in a way unlike any other biopic.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo, a British actor, is fantastic and it is an absolute scandal that he has not been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar this year. Perhaps the Academy is still tapping themselves on the back for giving ""12 Years a Slave"" the Best Picture Oscar last year. When Oyelowo is making those speeches that King made to the Selma black clergy it was like I was watching King in the flesh. Oyelowo looks and sounds like King, effortlessly capturing his manner, grace and style and arguably most importantly his faith. Oyelowo simply pioneers the film in regards to performances, obviously helped along by the fame of his real-life counterpart, the other actors and actresses in the film simply revolve around him. This is especially obvious in the scenes where we get to see King and his colleagues deciding how to proceed in Selma. These backstage scenes seem just like how they would have been, providing an interesting viewpoint considering there isn't a lot of material detailing what happened. In these scenes King's colleagues also shine through, Colman Domingo (playing Ralph Abernathy) and Wendell Pierce (playing the Rev. Hosea Williams) are both worth mentioning for their performances. These scenes though do not focus on King and thus do well to emphasise that he was both not alone nor was a God of sorts, but just simply a great man, making him even more relatable and deserved of my sympathy.<br/><br/>Of course ""Selma"" is a true story and the film sticks to it throughout ultimately doing it a perfect kind of justice. The fact that the film chose Selma as what it was going to cover was a good choice. There was the ""battleground"" that King decided to use as a means by which to end the struggle blacks had experienced in regards to registering to vote. It's ultimately the moments which have been well documented that are where the film thrives, ""Bloody Sunday"" for example. But where the film begins to waver is in its half-hearted commitment towards King's personal life and I believe this comes from how we obviously know less about King's personal life then what we know about him as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. It's those scenes where we see King giving speeches or leading the marches through Selma which are the film's best, whereas the hypothesised conversations between King and his wife, and meetings between the C.I.A. director J. Edgar Hoover and President Lyndon B. Johnson really bring the film out of focus.<br/><br/>""Selma"" though is ultimately the best biopic I have ever seen. Although I've mentioned that King's personal life for me got in the way of the film, you have to see ""Selma"", not only because of how, as critic Richard Roeper put it, it's a film that provides a history lesson but certainly doesn't feel like a history lecture, but also because of how the film finally grants King the cinematic justice he deserves with a brilliant performance by Oyelowo."

The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement. Director Ava DuVernays SELMA tells the real story of how the revered leader and visionary Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his brothers and sisters in the movement prompted change that forever altered history.<br/><br/>Poor Selma, being shut out from the Oscars and BAFTA awards for acting and directing (Which deserves some nominations for god sake) but to be honest I thought this was going to be a Oscar bait film, you know like The Butler or Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, because I had no idea that this movie existed until award season stared and that's when I had that thought of Oscar bait, but after seeing the film myself I can say no it's not a Oscar bait film. It's actually a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>What really surprise me is how much films David Oyelowo has been in 2014, I didn't take much notice but now I have and I was extremely shocked how he got overlooked by the Academy and the BAFTA, because his performance in this movie is by the best I've seen this year. I didn't just see David Oyelowo being Oyelowo, no I only saw Martin Luther King and nothing else. I can see that David Oyelowo had strong passion for this role that he put everything in it and he absolutely nailed it. David you may not got a Oscar nomination for you outstanding performance but you won everyone over with your acting and you got a bright future a head of you buddy. Great work David.<br/><br/>Ava DuVernay who to me is a unknown directed. I haven't seen the other work that she did so I can't really say, but after watching Selma I know straight away that we got a good one here, because she directed this movie with has much care as possible and effort to show how bad it was back then and she did it so well her that getting snubbed at the Oscars for directing is crime in my eyes.<br/><br/>The one thing that makes Selma a truly great movie is the fact that the movie isn't all inspiring or beautifully touching like most Holly Wood clich√© Oscar bait movies, no the director smartly takes a different turn for the best and just show what really happened and try not to make it all inspiring and make Martian look like a god like person and all that other stuff that's been done to death now. Selma steps away from that and shows the mistakes that this guy did because let's not forget that Martian Luther Kings was only human, just a guy who's not perfect of what he did and I hate it when Holly Wood takes a real life person and make him perfect and a god to everybody's eyes and when you look up the person in real life you start to see these other stories where he made mistakes then and there and you find out that the movie isn't being truthfully to the real life person, but in this movie Selma takes that clich√© and say ""Sorry but that dose not happen. Go away Holly Wood"". <br/><br/>Now for problems: Martin Luther Kings was the only interesting and the one person I cared about in this movie, but the other character's I didn't really give a fuss about them. I know I should but really I don't, I don't even remember they names at all. You may find them interesting but I didn't.<br/><br/>Selma overall isn't just a Oscar bait or too Hollywood movie.

","We still need these films. I have heard the arguments of ""this was so long ago"" or ""racism is gone, we don't need to see this film"". I will tell you as a white man that neither of those arguments are valid. These events were only 50 years ago. In fact some people who took part in these events are still alive. It baffles me that people don't think Selma is an important film. Selma is the most powerful film I have seen this year. I saw it by myself, and it took me places emotionally that I don't think I have been before in a theater.<br/><br/>First of all, major props to everyone involved in the making of this film. I know the Oscar nominations caused controversy on whether or not Selma should have been nominated for more awards, in particular, David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay. Out of all the performances I have seen this year Oyelowo is definitely in the top 5. He embodies everything we know about Martin Luther King Jr, and even gives a little bit of spin on it. That's the other thing I loved about this film, I cant tell you how many very famous actors took these small parts, so they could be a part of this incredibly important film.<br/><br/>I also liked that this wasn't necessarily just a Dr. King story. It told the story of the Selma march, and even quite a bit about some of the other important people involved in this famous event. Wilkinson played Johnson perfectly, as he was torn between changing the voting rights or not. But there were so many other incredible performances that could have been recognized. Even Oprah did a really nice job. But the film took it to another level once I saw the Selma march. Reading about such events in history books is one thing, but when you see what man is capable of in a graphic way was another thing completely. These people were just asking for their voting rights to be recognized and they were brutally beaten and murdered. The way DuVernay shot the film made it that much more devastating. Seeing shots of white men riding horses with guns and batons just wiping the bridge with the blood of these people was one of the most brutal things I have ever seen. I'm getting choked up just writing about it. I was literally shaking my head ready to yell at the screen when this happened.<br/><br/>I don't think I have been that impacted by a film in a long time. The fact that it was only half a century ago is unbelievable. Oyelowo gave us some extraordinary speeches and the supporting cast was impeccable.

","Selma (2014) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Excellent drama about Martin Luther King, Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his attempt to stage a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama during 1965. The film follows King as he falls into one road block after another including being rejected protection from President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) as well as Governor Wallace (Tim Roth) trying to throw violence at them.<br/><br/>SELMA has been falling victim to some recent attacks because of it not being 100% full of facts. Well, I hate to break this to people but no ""true story"" film has ever been 100% truthful. Things are made up and changed for dramatic purposes all the time so I find that to be a pretty weak excuse to attack this film. SELMA, for my money, is a wonderful little film that manages to pack a nice punch and get its message across without having to preach or go for some sort of shock value like the previous years 12 YEARS A SLAVE. By comparison I think this film deserves a lot more praise than it's getting and a lot of the praise should certainly go to Oyelowo.<br/><br/>Playing a well-known famous person has to be one of the hardest jobs for an actor because most people watching you knows the real person so they come into the movie with an idea of what they should be seeing. Oyelowo is simply marvelous here because he manages to make you believe you're seeing King and not just an actor repeating his speeches. I thought there was a certain spirit that just graced Oyelowo's performance and it was so memorable and touching in spots. I thought the actor did a terrific job at bringing out the spirit of the character and the passion and fear of the events he's in. Both Wilkinson and Roth are very good in their supporting roles as are the rest of the players.<br/><br/>Another major plus is that the film has a terrific atmosphere to it. There's not a single frame where you feel like you're watching 2014 made up to look like 1965. Director Ava DuVernay does a very good job at making you feel as if you're back in 1965 with the look of the film. The cinematography, music score and editing are all top-notch as you'd expect with a film like this. I did find a few flaws in the film including the constant text to show the FBI following King as well as some of the musical selections took you out of what was going on.<br/><br/>With that said, it's really too bad that SELMA is gaining some critics due to something that most films do. I think the movie has its heart in the right place and put that up against the wonderful performances and you're left with an extremely moving picture that manages to tell a great story about one of the most important events in the Civil Rights movement."
"Matt-144-792009","6","1","4","21 January 2015"," Selma: A Very Important Film about a very important bit of History
","In Selma David Oyelowo portraits the legendary historical figure Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The story joins Dr. King from his Noble Peace Prize award presentation in Oslo Norway in 1965 through his famous march from Selma to Montgomery Alabama. The film pin points several key moments and people in this violent and turbulent time in history. Some powerful moments include Dr. King's meetings with LBJ played very convincingly by Tom Wilkinson. This is a tour de force cast with Oprah Winfrey, Tim Roth, Giovanni Ribisi, Cuba Gooding Jr., Martin Sheen and Common to name a few. Let me start off by saying that this is a very important film that everyone should see, as a means to become more acquainted with this important time in history. Each actor with major roles in the film played actual people in history, not just random plot driving fictional vehicles. Tim Roth is phenomenal as George Wallace, the racist governor of Alabama. Dylan Baker does a very convincing J. Edgar Hoover, a better cast than Leonardo DiCaprio in J. Edgar (2013). But at the heart of this film is David Oyelowo, carefully playing one of the most iconic and important men in American history. A lot rides on the shoulders of an actor who plays that role. You don't want to be doing an SNL sketch type parody of Dr. King, despite how easy it could be to jump into his iconic speech patterns. Oyelowo, brings great heart and spirit to show us a deeper look at Dr. King. I think it's a more intimate portrayal that shows more pain, worry and self-doubt than ever before. Oyelowo's performance is the best part of this film. As for the directing, I feel the director Ava Duvernay was a little in over her head in a project of this magnitude. Her directing expertise has been limited to a few independent films, shorts and television episodes. In a recent interview on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, Duvernay pointed out that she is an independent film director. As she put it, a person who films people talking in rooms. Despite some amazing performance, Selma plays out like a History Channel or HBO miniseries. I think a more experienced director should have been called in for this project. Overall Selma made me deeply reflect on the rights I and most Americans take so arrogantly for granted. It's sad we live in a country that would rather vote for a TV game show winner than for State and Local officials. I think it's extremely short sighted to think of what Dr. King did only as it directly relates to African Americans in this country. Dr. King's message was about everyone having a voice, so that the powers that govern us reflect the wants and needs of the people. We are not living out Dr. King's dream without that voice. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review, please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"

","It seems a film like Selma, could not come out at a more appropriate time than now. I am sure that everyone who reads this review and has paid attention to the news this past year, whether in print, online, or on television will be familiar with all the murders that have been going on and labelled as racially motivated. These stories (and there were quite a few of them), dominated the news headlines because of the uncertainty and ambiguousness of the killings as well as inciting people to create riots and marches and in some ways showing that even after all these years with the march in Selma, Alabama as well as the work that Martin Luther King, and others have done, will perhaps still not fully be realized, or come to the dream ending that they were originally hoping for. Were all these recent events across America, based solely on racism? I am no expert in criminology, or anything like that, but it certainly makes one take notice and consider such options for a moment. The film is an interesting testament to the racial times during the mid 1960's and the battle for integration and segregation no longer as well as the right to vote for all African Americans. The thing about this film coming out as timely and at such a time as this, is that it shows that in some ways we have accomplished a lot, but in other ways not so much. The message and the theme behind Selma, is certainly an interesting one and it is a very well made film, but I just wished I liked the film better than I did. While, I still enjoyed it and found a lot to admire about it, I did not find it a perfect film, or a masterpiece. I find it quite hard to actually pinpoint the negatives about this film because I really did not have too many problems with it and it was a well made film, both on the sides of work in front of and behind the camera. I liked how the film was more of an independent production and that everything in the film was more low key, subtle and gave a more authentic feeling and look to the events. As with any Hollywood film dealing with real people and subject matter, I often feel that the smaller you go in scope, sometimes the better your film will turn out. If this had been a film made for a lot of money with a lot of big names and actors in it as well as a lot of pomp and expenses poured into making it a big, huge, epic film, than I think the simple yet subtle tone the director went for, would have been destroyed and I don't think the film would have come out as well, or had as lasting an impact. The film is also a little slower in it's pace with no major action sequences, or anything like that, but instead thoughtful scenes involving dialogue and good acting and emotions to further emphasize everything that Martin Luther King, was trying to achieve and the various setbacks and racial overtones that were preventing him from achieving his dream. While the film was very interesting, well acted, written and directed, I did not feel I could connect with it on an emotional level like I was hoping for. At the same time, I did not wish for the film to be overly dramatic, or even melodramatic in either it's acting, tone, or music. That would have felt forced and ruined the film for me completely. I was also glad it did not go the route of Lee Daniels' The Butler, which could have been a really good film, had it avoided all political bias and manipulation that I felt completely ruined the film. Fortunately, Selma is not like that. Back to connecting on an emotional level, I just felt that often times the film and the characters and people in it, often felt distant to me and I could not connect, or emphasize with them as much as I wanted to. Yes, I certainly got the feeling that everything that was going on back then with the racial attitudes as well as some of the violence that erupted from it was terrible, but I often felt that Selma, looked at and addressed such issues at a distance and at times I found the film to be not quite delving deep enough into the character study, or the feelings and emotions that were happening to these people. The film certainly is not a bad film and I am still giving it quite a good rating, but it was one of those films that didn't affect me the way I wanted it to. Take 2013's 12 Years a Slave for example. That was an excellent film dealing with slavery and racial attitudes at a different time period, but it still felt just as relevant today and while the film was very brutal and sometimes hard to watch in it's depiction of such brutality and horror, I felt that it hit me hard on an emotional level and really made for an unforgettable movie experience. I could connect to that film and felt more of an impact with it and unfortunately, I could not say the same for Selma. Selma, did not need to resort to brutality to get my attention, but I just wished that it did not seem as stark, cold, or distant with the characters, or subject matter at hand and I think I would have enjoyed it even more if I could have connected to it in the same way as 12 Years a Slave."

","Selma was better then I expected I have to admit. When I saw it was a Harpo production I had my doubts but I was wrong. David Oyelowo did a good job portraying Dr. Martin Luther King in his fight for the civil rights every man should have, regarding his color, race or religion. It's a touching biography where I had a couple tears running down my cheeks at some point. It's a shame that some humans are such disgusting people, especially in the South of America at that time. It was not good being colored and living in the South in a not so distant past. To me Selma was interesting to watch even though I don't totally agree with non-violent protests. It's sad to say but without violence the high society, if you can call them like that, will always be stomping on your head. Dr. Martin Luther King was a great man, despise his stupid belief in a God. How you can believe in a God with all the injustices in the world is a thing I can not understand. Well, that's my point of view. Anyways, Selma is a good touching movie to watch."
"Mobithailand","10","1","5","7 April 2016"," A movie truly worthy of multi-awards but largely ignored by white, wealthy Americans of a certain age.
","At long last a movie worthy of Oscar nominations. Yet it was totally ignored by the BAFTAS and only received two Golden Globes nominations, (neither of which it won), and only a single major Oscar nomination, but at least we can be grateful it was for 'best movie'. Out of all the films I saw for the 2014 Oscar nominations, Selma should have won the 'Best Movie', hands down, as should Selma's director, and lead actors in the best acting categories.<br/><br/>Selma is the story of a three-month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King campaigned to secure equal voting rights for blacks by making an epic, non-violent, but 'illegal' march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.<br/><br/>The movie is labelled a bio-pic ‚Äì but is it really?<br/><br/>To me, a bio-pic tells the story of someone's' life ‚Äì or least a good part of a person's life. A three month period in someone's life ‚Äì however momentous, is more the story of a true event than the story of a life, which in the case of King's life, included numerous other momentous events. But let's not get hung up on semantics.<br/><br/>I was nineteen years old in 1965, and I still recall the event which was covered widely by the British media. <br/><br/>I believe that everyone from Britain and the United States who cares about this troubled world we live in today, should see Selma, as indeed they should see 12 Years a Slave, the Oscar winner in 2013.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because we in Britain were prime participants in the abominable slave trade that brought millions of Africans to America in the first place, and because Americans can see how, within living memory, blacks were still being treated as inferior human beings and were miss-treated, tortured and even killed with impunity¬Ö<br/><br/>We should keep this fact in the back our minds when we look at the horrors of the 21st Century, in Syria, Iraq, Nigeria and elsewhere. Not so long ago, we used to do some pretty inhuman things to our fellow human beings ourselves. Maybe that knowledge will help us to understand that there always have been ‚Äì and always will be ‚Äì very evil people in this world who, if left to their own devices, will perpetrate unspeakable acts of violence to their fellow men. The Nazis killed 6 million Jews less than 90 years ago and the 'killing fields' of Biafra, Rwanda, Bosnia and so many more abominations have occurred in even more recent times.<br/><br/>Yes, we should do well do dwell on man's inhumanity to man.<br/><br/>It seems incredible that during my own lifetime, blacks in America were denied basic equal rights; banned from 'white' hotels, denied entrance to 'white' schools and, critically, were denied the vote in many southern States. They were also regularly strung up and hanged by the Klu Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Martin Luther King's historic march from Selma to Montgomery was an event that was initially stopped in its tracks by ruthless state troopers. They did this by charging at the would-be marchers on horseback; by beating them mercilessly with clubs, and even shooting and killing them.<br/><br/>When, in its third attempt, the march finally succeeded in taking place, it was one of the 20th century's most momentous and iconic happenings. It resulted in the then US President, Lyndon B Johnson, passing a bill that removed all voting barriers for blacks.<br/><br/>American readers may think that I only support movies with predominantly British cast, but nothing could be further from the truth. Selma was made by first-time feature-length film director, Ava DuVernay'; a female, black American. She is clearly the major mover and inspiration for this film and what a wonderful job she has made of it.<br/><br/>As indeed does the British Actor David Oyelowo as King; as does British actor Carmen Ejogo as King's wife; as does British actor Tom Wilkinson as LBJ; as does British actor Tim Roth as Governor George Wallace. All British, but all so American in their roles.<br/><br/>Why DuVernay didn't cast Americans in these roles, I can only guess at, but it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>For me, not only should DuVernay have been nominated for best director, but so should have all the above-listed actors in their respective acting categories. Tim Roth as George Wallace is a stunning revelation¬Ö trust me.<br/><br/>I am glad to see that the song 'Glory' is up for best song, as it is a soaring and inspirational melody ‚Äì but even that was ignored by BAFTA.<br/><br/>Shame on the BAFTA and Oscar Academies! What is wrong with you? Surely this lack of nominations isn't all about 'race' raising its ugly head again is it? I read somewhere that the Oscar academy was turned off Selma when the left-leaning Democrats, (which comprise a majority of the voting academy), put it out that the film did not show one of their favourite Democratic Presidents, LBJ, in a very flattering light.<br/><br/>Considering how Hollywood routinely twists real life events to suit their own ends, this is utter hypocrisy on a grand scale. Never mind that the film is about one America's all-time heroes, ignore it because it casts a few aspersions on a long dead, white, Democratic President.<br/><br/>Well, I guess many of these faded stars from yesteryear who make up the academy voters are all as egotistical as that 'Birdman' character. That's why they loved Birdman so much and disliked Selma. I reckon the only reason Selma was put up in the single category of best film was to avoid charges of being racist.<br/><br/>If you see only one movie in the next twelve months, make it Selma ‚Äì you will not be disappointed."

","""We must March! We Must Stand up!"" Dr. King <br/><br/>Although I was very much alive in 1965 during the march on Selma and equally so for the march from there to Montgomery, the docudrama Selma has brought them to life with a clarity I didn't have at that time. This film presents almost without prejudice the actions of Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo), Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth), and President Lyndon Baines Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) in the march for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, freeing people of color to determine their fates through enfranchisement.<br/><br/>Director Ava DuVernay's Selma dramatizes the culture-changes through Dr. King's perspective as we listen to his lyrically-phrased speeches (modified for copyright purposes, I understand) and carefully articulated private conversations (how could anyone improve on ""the dark corners of the halls of power"")? Although much of his private speech has the unreal ring of grandstanding, notwithstanding his great gift of oratory, the film portrays a leader at the peak of his creative and leadership gifts, with a hint of fatalism that plays subtly with our historical knowledge of his assassination. He has just won the Nobel Peace Prize but is far away from peace.<br/><br/>This docudrama also touches on the challenges for his marriage to Coretta Scott King, mostly referring to the demands that were compromising his status, not just through the FBI's attempts to undermine it but also his well-known affairs, barely referenced here. Although I care not a bit about his personal life, his success as the premiere civil rights leader was made vulnerable by his indiscretions and should have been addressed, just as any current biography of JFK should address his infidelities.<br/><br/>The lead performances, starting with David Oyelowo as MLK, are first rate. The film takes a slow, deliberate, and wholly informative journey through King's civil rights days, thereby making a most accessible docudrama out of a most insane time."

","Dr. Martin Luther King Jr infamously stood at the Lincoln memorial proclaiming ""I have a dream"" to over 250,000 people - but that's not what Selma is about.
The film charts a specific period in 1965, with the civil rights movement well underway and segregation now illegal in the United States, but violent opposition in the south blocking black Americans' right to vote.
King leads his peaceful army in an epic march from the town of Selma, through deepest darkest Klan country, to the courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama, to exercise their rights.
The event is credited as having forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act - a portrayal under discussion for its authenticity, as Selma suggests Johnson was a road block to civil rights when historical fact shows otherwise.
The filmmakers couldn't have gotten away from the endless hushed conversations between government officials and various activists if they'd tried, but unlike most political dramas, these instances are well-placed fraught scenes breaking up the noise and violence of the main story.
King is understandably sanctified in this celebration of one of his most significant achievements but the film also places unexpected and artfully presented praise on the members of the press who put the story unfolding in Selma in front of the world's eyes, strengthening the movement to a tipping point, with the closing scene carefully honouring other lesser known heroes of civil rights."

","I love this movie and have seen it many times. It is beautifully acted and the picture is beautiful as well. I love this movie because I have always been interested in learning about the civil rights movement. During my elementary years, we vaguely talked about civil rights, and so it wasn't until high school that I started learning more about the movement. It really interested me and this movie has helped me to learn even more and understand what went on and what is going on. It helped me to visualize it better.
This movie is about Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement that he led: a peaceful, non-violent one. It follows him as he and the others helping in this movement marched and petitioned for their rights, specifically in a city called Selma, in Alabama.
Like I said before, I've always been interested in the civil rights movement, but I haven't always been very educated about it. This movie helped to educate me on a few of the many events that happened during that time period. Nothing in this movie made me question its historical accuracy. It was interesting for me to see the different civil rights groups and how they interacted and did things differently.
This movie was directed by Ava DuVernay. I have not seen any of her other films, but she did an amazing job directing this one. Some of the main actors in this movie are David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey, Carmen Ejogo, Tom Wilkinson, and Stephan James among others. I have seen quite a few of these actors in other movies and think they are all great actors. They all did a phenomenal job in this film. My favorite part of this movie is when they are going on their second (I think it's their second?) march to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They end up turning back and not finishing the march, but it's just really cool to see how united everyone is in a great cause.
I really love this movie. It is well filmed and well acted. I love the history it shares and uses to educate. I love the historical characters it portrays and I love the courage and conviction it shows in the film of everyone in that movement. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves history, especially civil rights history."

Dr. King wanted to turn the other cheek, get the white people involved, and X wanted to fight back.

","Selma was a really good movie. One really great scene was where ""Martin Luther King"" got the white colored people to help him in the march, then when they were granted entrance into Montgomery, he guided them back because he wanted them to do it all by themselves with no help. The plot of the movie was to show how bad discrimination was that they couldn't even cross over to the town over or whatever because it was pretty much like death for them if they did. I already knew that discrimination was bad. I didn't know it was as bad as they portrayed it in the movie though, maybe worse. But i did grow up watching videos of african americans being beat to death during their peaceful protests in my history classes every once in a while. The history part of the movie was interesting to me. Ava DuVernay is the director of this movie. The only other movie i've watched that she directed was ""A wrinkle in time"". Both Selma and A wrinkle in time are really good movie, and so different from one another. Having watched Selma and A wrinkle in time, ithink im going to have to start watching more movies directed by Ava.
I liked how the whole movie was portrayed. I liked how Martin Luther King wanted no violence at all because he just wanted to be peaceful and let things change naturally with the sympathy of others when watching the people from selma get beaten basically to death.

The movie showed the struggles people had to live with and how innocent people would get murdered just because of the color of their skin. This point in time was traumatizing. These innocent people who were american where getting treated poorly because of one thing and its the color of their skin. They even killed white people for standing up with Dr.King. The movie has a great story line and showed what these people went through, some scenes were a little bit much and showed the police and citizens killing these people. I have seen a few movies with some of the women that play in this movie. I think the people they chose to play these parts did really good. I liked the History shown through the film. I didn't enjoy the people getting treated like the way they did and the killings. I have seen this movie outside of school. I would if they wanted to see this point/part of history and time.

","A movie about Martin Luther King's march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is an inspiring movie full of twists and turns. It's rating of PG-13 is because of the violence that's shown and the language that's used. But it's based on real events that actually happened.<br/><br/>Set in 1965-ish amid the height of the Civil Rights movement, Selma is an accurate portrayal of what happened during the time. The amount of violence shown in the film is definitely not for everyone as it gets really bad, but those things actually happened. A peaceful march turned violent because racist bigots got butthurt that a bunch of colored people were marching peacefully, obeying the laws of the road using the sidewalks and crosswalks, not impeding traffic or doing anything illegal. Nowhere in the constitution does it say that black people aren't allowed to assemble peacefully.

So the sheriff decided to beat him because the man was being ""defiant"". This lead to a woman hitting the sheriff to get him to back off from the elderly man. It lead to total chaos and everyone getting hurt. That scene hit me really hard, because I can never understand that level of brutality.

","The focus of this film is the 1965 march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, the state capital. The purpose of the march was to protest the lack of voting rights given to black citizens despite their legal right to vote. As Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the main protest leaders, the film also focuses on his personal life.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is a perfect choice for the role of King. He easily portrays the great leader's ability to deliver great speeches while he also shows genuine vulnerability in King's home life where his mission has obviously taken a toll on his marriage and family. Oyelowo gives a very well-rounded performance.<br/><br/>Director Ava DuVernay has done a superb job of taking an important historical tale and turning it into a very moving drama. Whether it be the camera movements and editing during crowd scenes (some of which are violent) or the use of low lighting in interior scenes, the viewer is carried through this special story with wonderful technique.<br/><br/>Regarding the violent scenes, DuVernay seems to know exactly how much is important to show and how much is enough. Those scenes are never in-your-face, gratuitous, or unnecessarily prolonged. Many other directors could learn from this principle.<br/><br/>The conclusion is truly magical. While it does not pretend that the struggles ended (as recent events have shown), it takes a grand moment and turns it into the celebration and glory it truly deserves. As a testament to the great collective spirit of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement during one of the most inspiring decades in recent history, ""Selma"" moves the spirit in the best of ways. Truly exhilarating and inspiring.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Ava DuVernay"

David Oyelowo gives a stirring performance as Dr. King, and Tom Wilkinson is quite capable as LBJ. It is easy to feel the reverberations when these two powerful, intelligent men clashed over when and how to give African Americans unimpeded access to the vote while people were beaten and murdered in the streets by angry rednecks.<br/><br/>In a time now where protesting has become much more common, and the people of this country are divided over many issues, a film like this is deeply important, because it reminds us of just how we can come together and overcome the ingrained problems of this country to forge a better future. Segregation and racism was so rooted in the south then, and it is truly not that much better now, but intelligent people stood together, made plans, and stuck to their guns.

In addition, some of the core members of demonstration decide who should be in the very front in marching by scissors-paper-stone. If I were in this situation, I would hope not to be the one in front to death. They are of course fearful for their action, but they end up with overcoming the fear.

"Rickting","8","0","1","27 January 2016"," Oscar bait done properly
","Selma got nominated for Best Picture. Of course it did. It's a story focussing on an important issue and the main character is an important historical figure who had to overcome lots of obstacles to change the world. If that isn't Oscar bait, what is? Selma didn't look like much. It's just the same type of drama we get every year, which the Academy will love while the public rightly prefer better movies that just get ignored by the Oscars. It only got nominated for 2 awards, and it's admittedly good theme song Glory beat Everything is Awesome from The Lego Movie, which was not the right choice. However, with this film prepare for a pleasant surprise. Selma is a very good film. Not a masterpiece, but miles better than The Theory of Everything and Whiplash. This is what every Oscar baiting movie should aim for: a worthy, powerful movie which is also entertaining and focuses on being enjoyable to people who aren't Oscar voters or critics. Selma is something of a triumph, and a film where I genuinely wasn't bored at all throughout.<br/><br/>David Oyelowo is excellent as Martin Luther King, and was certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination. Ava DuVernay's direction is flat, but in a good way. She uses style sparingly (When it's used, it's very effective) and intelligently, and keeps the film grounded in realism, letting the surprisingly strong script and memorable performances tell the story instead of a lot of flashy visuals. Selma is admittedly going the motions through historical events at times and is somewhat predictable, but its characters are believable and its dramatic moments are genuine, rather than forced. Selma is quite a hard hitting movie at times, and it manages to keep you invested throughout. It is still pretty formulaic and you know what's coming much of the time, but rather than selling a message and shoving it down your throat, it's a walk through history which sells the dramatic side of the story well without being overly sentimental. A really good film overall, and far better than I was expecting.<br/><br/>8/10"

","An exceptional episode of the legendary activist Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s (Oyelowo) truncated 39-year-old life is finally brought up to the big screen by a female black director DuVernay, chronicles the historical voting rights marches from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, which pressures president Lyndon B. Johnson (Wikinson), to pass the bill to eliminate restrictions on voting for black people. An Oscar BEST PICTURE nominee with only another nomination and final win for BEST ORIGINAL SONG (GLORY by Common and John Legend), to a great degree, is viewed being discriminatingly given the cold shoulder over other key nominations such as for Oyelowo's leading actor and DuVernay in directing, a perennial disdain aiming at the senior-white-male demography in the academy. Yet, Rome is not built in one day and for the elderly, it is ever harder to change their deep-rooted prejudice, so we need more patience.<br/><br/>Started in 1964, when King accepts his Nobel Peace Prize and addresses an earnest speech sans rhetoric as possible as he can. Oratory is a critical mainstay in Oyelowo's performance, not impeccably resembling King in person, Oyelowo imparts an extraordinary poise to lay bare the most human characteristics in King as opposed to his iconic image, which is mainly reflected in the showcasing sequences of a few significant speeches, and they're magnificent in spite of the overhanging perturbation that they may fall into overblown strategy which we have all seen too many times. But in other time, viewers also get a chance to observe King's life in private, the interactions with his friends and followers, dissenters and politicians, more intimately is the subtle tension between him and his wife Coretta (Ejogo), who is severely stressed by the frequent prank calls with life-threatening viciousness and the looming danger can never be dissipated around her husband and their family, DuVernay even humanises King with a tabooed reference about his affairs, allows him a considerately long time to answer Coretta's forthright question. King is dethroned from being an ideal idol, his indecision is shown in the critical moment of the movement, not the guideline belief, but the practical side.<br/><br/>Whether or not political machinations are involved is the grey area, for example, who has miraculously arranged national TV broadcasting of the first small-scale march, King's men or other parties? The film refuses to divulge any information on that front, which prompts the whole scene to appear like a rehearsed performance, those fearless black people as canon fodder whereas King conveniently skips the initiation march, bravely take the beatings from the police defence, then being timely manoeuvred on TV to instigate a national sense of compassion in favour of the beaten, all smells too fishy, that is why we should give DuVernay two-thumbs up for her guts to debunk the elephant-in-the-room, the utterly putrid side of USA's democracy, even for such a noble cause, the movement cannot be achieved without those sly tactics, where a small number of innocent people must be sacrificed for a bigger and loftier picture, what's more stringent is, until today, the same pattern still prevails and reality barely advances in the race prejudice half a century later in America. That's why this film is so significant, in a worldwide scale, many places are all on the analogy of this.<br/><br/>For president Lyndon B. Johnson, DuVernay also bravely utilises the dramatic license to antagonise him against the crusade, everything is contingent on a hierarchy of priorities, the equality vs. supremacy battle only becomes urgent when the situation makes him and his government look bad, not because it is the right thing to do NOW, another applause for DuVernay to conspicuously materialise that corruptive facade of bureaucracy. And thanks to Tim Roth's unrepentantly despicable portrayal of Gov. George Wallace, which pushes him as the No. 1 villain here, audience is granted a glimpse of the true color of a unabashed politician, both Wilkinson and Roth are excelling in animating these two unsympathetic characters on the screen with their superb expertise, galvanising to clap eyes on.<br/><br/>SELMA is first and last, an uncompromising piece of cinema recounts a not-to-be-forgotten and pretty recent triumph in our awakening consciousness against social injustice, it tells us more than its subject matter - not to diminish the importance of equality, since it is still a long way to go in any bifurcation to reach egalitarianism, moreover it is also piquantly dangerous, once we realise the roots of our society is based on a system corrupted by human frailties, it can attribute a more pessimistic view towards our own existence as human beings, and that is not for everyone, that's why it is an oddity in the mainstream conduit, personally I think this is the reason why it gets snubbed other than the ostensible race and gender partiality, thus albeit political themes are rarely my cuppa, but for this one, DuVernay wins my endorsement thoroughly."
"andy-66447","5","0","1","24 August 2015"," ""Selma"" Is Powerful But Historially Inaccurate
","Ava DuVernay's Selma is a monumental achievement in filmmaking with one very glaring historical inaccuracy. Much as Steven Spielberg did with Lincoln, DuVernay wisely shows us just one small but important snapshot in the life of the film's hero, Dr. Martin Luther King. The 1965 Alabama march (Selma to Montgomery) was perhaps the peak event of the Civil Rights Movement, directly resulting in passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Organized by Dr. King, local police violence against non-violent African-American citizens was broadcast all over the world, and was, in large part, responsible for changing America's attitude toward the racist injustices of the day.<br/><br/>British actor David Oyelowo plays Dr. King not so much as an impersonation, but as a character who embodies King's spirit. Oyelowo's King intones the exact cadences of Dr. King's preaching. While we know we're not actually watching King himself, it certainly sounds like it. Ironically, DuVernay was not allowed to use any of King's actual verbiage, making Oyelowo's acting achievement all the more astounding. He's not King, and he's not even speaking King's own words, but again, it sure sounds like it. Why he wasn't nominated for a Best Actor Oscar is beyond me.<br/><br/>My primary issue with Selma is its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson as a roadblock to passage of the Voting Rights Act ‚Äì legislation for which King fought aggressively. DuVernay depicts King and Johnson practically coming to fisticuffs over this bill, with Johnson enraged by King's bullying. In reality, Johnson and King may not have always seen eye-to-eye, but Johnson considered the Voting Rights Act one of the two greatest legislative achievements of his presidency, and he deemed King an ally in the fight against racism in the South. Perhaps DuVernay felt the storyline required a certain amount of tension, but the tension here is misplaced. Tension between King and the local sheriff? Fine. Tension between King and the Southern local media? To be expected. But King vs. Johnson? Not only is it historically inaccurate, but it tarnishes Johnson's legacy to an entire generation who might be unfamiliar with him. Now, I'm no huge fan of Lyndon Johnson's. But criticism must be applied when and where it is applies. Tom Wilkinson does as good a job as anyone I've seen play Johnson on screen, but the role itself is deeply flawed because it is simply wrong.<br/><br/>And that's unfortunate. This egregious deception tarnishes an otherwise excellent film. Selma legitimately brings us to a specific time and place. When the peaceful marchers cross the bridge to the courthouse, they come face to face with an all-white and heavily-armed police force. I felt as though I were actually there ‚Äì not simply watching some PBS documentary, but present and accounted for. It's a powerful scene, and to think that it occurred in my lifetime is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>On a more minor note, I was also disappointed that the titles at the end of the film (the ""what happened to these characters later in life"" titles) left out a great portion of former Alabama Governor George Wallace's story. DuVernay correctly tells us that in 1972, Wallace was shot and paralyzed while campaigning for United States President. What she leaves out is that Wallace renounced segregation about a year before his death in 1998. What an important piece of information! I would think the fact that the greatest political obstacle to racial harmony in the South publicly proclaimed a late-life conversion of thought is not only substantial, but also an uplifting footnote to the legacy of Dr. King. Almost 30 years after his assassination, King's greatest political enemy embraced his teaching! That's almost as incredible as the Roman Empire's embrace of Christianity. And it was omitted.<br/><br/>Again, Selma is mostly a great and powerful film. The disappointing legacy of the Civil Rights Movement is that African-Americans still believe, in large part, that law enforcement is working against them. Unfortunately, this belief is justified, as recent events have manifested. If we are lucky, Selma will act as a call to action for 21st-Century African-Americans to advocate for equal treatment by authorities. I hope Selma also acts as an example of how non-violent dissent is, in fact, the only dissent which has ever changed public policy and beliefs. A very important scene shows King and fellow Civil Rights leader Malcolm X disagreeing over the most effective method of achieving their goal. Non-violence must become the modus operandi for today's racial resistance, lest those opposed to change paint the entire movement incorrectly.<br/><br/>So do I recommend Selma? Yes, but with the caveat that this is a motion picture, and that, while it feels realistic, everything you see is not factual. I would not recommend using this film as a teaching tool for those too young to understand this reality."

","With a powerful script and an equally powerful lead turn from the next to unknown David Oyelowo, Selma is a fascinating look at a single period of time in the life of revolutionary Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. that shines a light on a perhaps oft forgotten moment in history that defined a benchmark moment in the history of the United States.<br/><br/>While we wait for the eventual straight up biopic of the beginnings and trials of King Jr, Selma acts as the single most powerful big screen incarnation of the larger than life figure we've yet seen and it's largely due to screenwriter Paul Webb's on point script work, promising female director Ava DuVernay's keen eye and the aforementioned turn by one time supporting actor Oyelowo.<br/><br/>Selma is a powder keg of explosive moments and scenarios yet with the restraint shown by all both behind and in front of the camera, it never overacts into melodrama or cheap emotional payoffs, every bit of emotion here is earnt by hard work and a clear affiliation for what all are a part of in this retelling of the movement. It's a credit to the film also that a film largely based around dialogue exchanges and small character moments feels so big in scope and by the films finale, you know what you've witnessed is quality Oscar worthy material.<br/><br/>It's hard not to talk about Selma now in the aftermath of it's much publicised Oscar appearance that saw it walk away with a solitary Best Original Song award for the quality John Legend/Common collaboration Glory and in the months that have passed there is still no real clear reason as to why in particular Oyelowo was not at the very least nominated for his turn as King Jr.<br/><br/>Capturing both the man's mannerisms, speech and appearance, Oyelowo transforms into King Jr in an outstanding fashion and displays a soul in his character that many actors can only aspire to when taking on such well known figures of history. Thanks to Oyelowo's turn we feel the heat of the battle King Jr finds himself in and his desire for what a march through the racially rampant backwoods of Alabama would mean to his peoples cause, its powerful stuff, fantastically played out.<br/><br/>Selma is not flashy or perhaps even overly cinematic but it's an important retelling of a moment in America's past that helped transform a nation into what it is today. With a raft of solid acting turns that is powerfully fronted by Oyelowo, DuVernay's film is a worthy dramatization of the events that took place in 1965 and a timely reminder to all about the struggles that many in the land of the free once, not so long ago, had to endure.<br/><br/>4 unlucky clergyman out of 5"

","Our society is a long way from true equality but we've come very far and ""Selma"" really helps show that.<br/><br/>The film does take some slight liberties with the history‚Äîlike the fact that King's real speeches are owned by another studio and they didn't have the rights to use them in this film‚Äîbut that doesn't take away from the power the story has. Combine that with a great cast and the inspirational tone of the film and you have a very moving feature."

","It may sound easy written, but it most definitely wasn't. The powerhouse performance by our lead (portraying MLK!) is something to be amazed by. But it's the whole story that is still gripping and even if you know the facts, will keep you at the edge of your seat. What makes this movie still important so many years later, is that while the divide is not as big as it was, there is still a lot to be done.<br/><br/>Even the small things are important and even when you get beaten down, you have to stand up and fight for what you believe in. Not easy to do and this movie shows more sides to MLK than just what he tried to accomplish. But it doesn't steer away from what most will remember him for. I watched this around the same time I watched American Sniper (Clint Eastwood directed) and while the Sniper movie was gripping as well, I was moved more by Selma and the events I watched unfolding in this movie ..."

","Martin Luther King Jr's march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights was one of the seminal moments of the Civil Rights Movement. Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" looks at the events that led to the march. David Oyelowo makes sure to bring to life King's strengths as well as his flaws, and it's a masterful performance.<br/><br/>The movie drew criticism for its depiction of Lyndon Johnson. In an interview on ""Democracy Now!"", DuVernay said ""Look, this is my movie. It's not a documentary."" It was one of the sad ironies of Johnson's presidency that as the Selma march happened - which he supported - he started sending US troops into North Vietnam, which eventually soured MLK's relation with him. A criticism that I have is that the movie underplays Coretta's role, depicting her as more of a wife than an activist. Otherwise it does a perfect job looking at the various people involved in the Civil Rights Movement. The footage included at the end adds a sense of realism.<br/><br/>When John Legend and Common (who plays James Bevel in the movie) accepted their Oscars for Best Original Song for ""Glory"", Legend noted that the US leads the world in incarceration. To be certain, the song mentions Ferguson. This shows that we have a long way to go in terms of justice, and there have even been retrogressions (such as the Supreme Court's invalidation of the Voting Rights Act). In short, Legend said exactly what needed to get said, as did Patricia Arquette (about the wage gap), Laura Poitras (about surveillance), Graham Moore (about suicide) and Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu (about immigration).<br/><br/>A 50th anniversary march got held recently, retracing the original. The Obamas participated, as did original participant John Lewis (played by Stephan James in the movie). ""Democracy Now!"" covered the reenactment, and Amy Goodman's interviewees explained the significance of popular movements in the 21st century (""Glory"" even played during one of the interludes). As the movie shows, justice is not an easy goal, but it is an attainable one. As one of the best movies of the year and of the decade, this is one that should be required in every history class. An absolute masterpiece."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Selma"" (2014) is not just a history lesson - it's engaging, involving and very well made picture. It features great performances from all involved, especially by lead man. Settings are good, they take you to the place. Music is very good here, direction, cinematography is solid.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Selma"" is not just a reminder of history, it is a very well movie on it's own. At running time 2 h this movie never drags and is involving from start till finish. There are some moving parts, but it's not a tearjerker. Based on very true events, this is a good history lesson as well as motion picture. All in all, this is a good movie."
"ahegde3149","7","0","1","21 May 2015"," Compelling Biopic
","Selma powered by a great performance by David Oyelowo is a well- crafted biopic not diverting even a bit from the fundamentals of Martin Luther King which form the foundation of this film. Director Ava DuVernay doesn't fail to hold your attention with realistic and compelling depiction of the events of the Civil Right Movement which could have felt boring history chapter otherwise. The tone of the storytelling is outright serious and make sure you keep that in mind before deciding to watch it. The story mainly focuses on MLK's campaign in Selma and the historic march for equal voting rights in 1965. Despite the dry nature of the script, it holds your attention thanks to great acting and the resonating themes which it dwells into. With moments be it the energetic speech delivery by Dr. King or the arousing feeling you get while watching the campaigners march hand in hand, Selma really strikes the right chord. 'Glory' which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song is really soul- stirring. The cinematography is solid and captures the unrest among the people perfectly. The screenplay could have been a bit less broad and a bit more stimulating. Despite few of its shortcomings, Selma is a really good biopic and a well crafted film.<br/><br/>RATING: [3.5/5]"

","""Selma"" (2014), directed by Ava DuVernay, is a snapshot of the US Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s and its attempts to get black Americans the vote in segregated southern states.<br/><br/>DuVernay has crafted a film which consistently refuses to take an idealistic perspective, ensuring the movie remains on a human scale throughout. It takes King as a significant but fallible figure; the British actor David Oyelowo perfectly captures the rhythms and cadence of his speech, although one of the strongest scenes in the film is where he is confronted over his marital infidelities by his wife, Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo). This mixture of the historical and the personal is the film's most impressive asset, refusing to succumb to a hagiographic awe and thus bearing comparison in approach to Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (2012).<br/><br/>Oyelowo embodies King throughout with admirable intensity and conviction; no better performance could be asked for. He's ably supported by a cast including Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson, Tim Roth as Alabama governor George Wallace and various other recognisable faces such as Martin Sheen and Giovanni Ribisi. However, it's clearly Oyelowo's film from the very beginning and is actually at its weakest when the film shifts it's focus, such as the scenes between Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), director of the FBI. Not only have issues been raised about their historical credibility, but they fail to have the same emotional resonance and momentum as the sequences showing how King and his associates actually go through the complex problems of organising the march. The infamous attack on the protesters by the police and civilian militia on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, shows DuVernay's skills as director, the fog of tear gas and the wounded, running people, shot and cut like a war scene.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Bradford Young shoots with a palette of warm brown and golden tones and DuVernay certainly isn't afraid of letting Young's camera sit unobtrusively in medium shot, letting the audience experience the actors' interactions and performances, most notably when King and another activist just cruise along the darkened Selma streets, reflecting on recent, tumultuous events.<br/><br/>The film is at its weakest when trying to cover too much, such as factional in-fighting in different civil rights groups or when it starts to resemble standard Hollywood biopics with the final triumphant scene at Alabama's state capitol: it's undoubtedly stirring but feels a little formulaic. ""Selma"" is at its best when it takes an alternative tack to the usual Hollywood formulations and delivers an intimate portrayal of a crucial moment in American history."
"simbasible","8","0","1","11 May 2015"," Important story and a powerhouse performance from David Oyelowo
","Selma has fine direction, a couple of wonderfully developed characters, involving and important story and a powerhouse performance from David Oyelowo, but it is also a flawed movie thanks to some not well developed characters, a couple of annoying choices with slow-motion and at times very standard approach. The approach here is the biggest problem and it is very polarizing - it is at times very grounded and wonderfully realistic, but at times also very typical, never quite distinguishing itself from other movies of this type and the film unfortunately lacks the energy and inherent power that it should have had.

","I'm telling you the truth.. I've watched this prejudiced that there weren't could be a better biopic for the African American leaders of the Civil Rights Movement since Spike Lee's Malcolm X. Fortunately the storytelling of a good biopic has changed since Spielberg's Lincoln, that suggested the notion of narrating the best achievement of the person in interest, instead of painfully portraying his life from birth to death, filling a good story with unnecessary trivia information, better characterised as gossip...The former PR has turned into a decent director for this one, the casting director's choices were brilliant (especialy portraying the white supremacists with Roth, Houston, Dwyer)and all of the performances are adequately powerful. It's quite an educational film about one the 2 great leaders of the African American Civil Rights Movement that doesn't sanctify him exactly (as Lee did in Malcolm X)but doesn't quite justifie also, his absolute power amongst his followers, since the start of the movie presents Dr. King receiving the Nobel Prize, thus meaning that his position in the movement and his popularity were already established. It would be sweeter if the storyteller mentioned, through short flash-backs, his earlier successes (working alongside JFK)so that his current start-of-the-film position, could be better understood."

","Watching this film gives me the opportunity to think about the evolution of the society in USA. It is common to comment negatively about USA outside this country, but if we look carefully the film and the hard situations faced by Martin Luther King and his collaborators, you may conclude that USA has evolved a lot in five decades. This is not a praise, it is just a fact. Now USA has a black president, something that at that time nobody would have even dreamed. Fights of Luther King and his movement were productive, they may not be enough even now, the news coming of shooting black persons from time to time are still coming, but the reality is that this film is by itself a confirmation of healthy Martin Luther Kings' ideas. Personally I like to congratulate director-producers and cast of the film, and to ask them to produce more materials as this one, which may help not only Americans but those societies still trapped in discrimination."
