","The reviews for ""The Devil's Advocate"" were not too kind, to say the least. But what did the critics refuse to see in this? With movies nowadays being nothing but flashy, over-the-top, masturbatory, CG-fests, ""The Devil's Advocate"" holds up like osmium.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good because it's quite understated and that's a virtue in today's cinema. The acting, while containing pretty lame Southern accents, is still pretty good. Even from Keanu, dude.<br/><br/>Sorely forgotten in it's day, the script tells a very deep, original and interesting story, with lots of development, respect for the characters, delicate pacing, and a head-spinning ending. The movie is solely about the people and their struggles. Fear takes hold of the audience through the dialogue.<br/><br/>Think of ""The Devil's Advocate"" as Woody Allen trying his hand at a horror/thriller and succeeding. This movie never makes you jump, but it puts you in a general state of discomfort through it's atmosphere. As with all memorable supernatural dramas, this one handles its spectacle with discretion and grace.<br/><br/>Isn't that what we hope to see when we watch any movie? 10/10"

","I watched this movie on DVD. It will be enough for me to mention that there had been no other movie where I'd had to pause the play in mere awe at the magnificence of the storyline! At a point, It was as if I could see my jaw on the floor praising in thorough amusement the brilliance, relevance-to-our-daily-lives, deepness of message, sophistication, great portrayal, top-of-the-class creativity, marvelous acting/directing/screen writing all having come together in a movie, which called for a rating of 9 out of 10 and no less, certainly, undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Al-Pacino's acting is to no surprise as brilliant as ever, exuding confidence, proficiency and clarity as always. Keanu Reaves leaves a great master-play in his work, meeting up to the acting skills required in displaying a character of wisdom, success, love and perhaps, of vanity. Charize Theron too puts up a play of passion in its right.<br/><br/>But what amused me more than all were the great and fantastic script-lines thrown around. All very meaningful and interesting indeed. The whole movie got me stunned and fixed at the edge of my desk seat, but the favorite part for me has to come at the end, where the theme of the movie comes to words and finds a chance as of clarifying itself in one the most brilliant ways I as one have ever seen possible! Recommended for everybody willing to enjoin on a meaningful story and a blend of excellent plays... surely a 9/10."
"Special-K88","Null","175","208","12 April 2002"," this is how you make a thriller
","Stylish, sexy, suspenseful thriller stars Reeves as an accomplished southern lawyer who's never been beaten; he travels to New York City to take a job with powerful legal mogul Pacino, but his once ideal life is soon turned upside down as he's plunged into a surreal, demonic world of lust, temptation, and vanity. Slick writing, direction, and an array of startling scenes, breathtaking effects, and dazzling performances make this an imaginative thriller quite unlike any other. Reeves gives one of his finest performances to date, aided immeasurably by a wild, wickedly over-the-top performance from Pacino and a first-rate supporting cast. Not for all tastes, but highly watchable indeed. ***Â½"
"ereinion","9","89","105","1 April 2005"," A beguiling experience
","This is one of the most intensely dark and beguiling movies I have seen. The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.<br/><br/>The ending brings a new, unpredictable and great twist to the story. I will not give it away. The supporting cast is pretty strong, specially Jeffrey Jones who plays a senior partner in Lucifer Pacino's firm and who first arises the suspicion in Kevin/Keanu with his mysterious behaviour, and Connie Nielsen as Cristabella, an extremely hot Italian colleague who is the very symbol of temptation. Nielsen looked even better here than in ""Gladiator"" and her performance is also more interesting. Charlize Theron displayed her range here for the first time, showing she had a great potential to become a star with her mix of ethereal beauty and acting talent. Reeves was also very good as the hotshot attorney and his looks elevated his macho hero potential. Al Pacino didn't disappoint, but his performance here counts as one of his least spectacular.<br/><br/>This is a dark movie with elements of horror and some gore and sex thrown in for good measure. I think Taylor Hackford never did it better. He gave us something to ponder on while entertaining and scaring us at the same time. It is a film one can't forget.9/10"
"bsamdahl","9","40","46","21 February 2002"," Vanity, my favorite sin
","The Devil's advocate is one of those movies you watch the first time just to see the climax, then with repeated viewing you pick up on the message of humanity and sin.  Al Pacino plays the role of Satan in a very powerful and believable manner. The exchange between Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino towards the end of the film may upset a few people's religious beliefs. Al Pacino as Satan really makes you think and nod your head in agreement.  Warning....Al Pacino is so convincing he may make some people start questioning their own beliefs.  Keanu Reeves is at his best when confronting Satan as if he is playing poker with him. In the end he succumbs to vanity as all humans do from time to time.  I think that Keanu portrayed the stages of Kevin Lomax well. He goes from a small town southern lawyer who never questions why he never loses a case, to a big city attorney who hears revelations from his mother about his father and sees his wife commit suicide. In the end, Kevin Lomax uses one of Satan's lines, ""free will"", against him.  This is an excellent film worth seeing again and again."

","When Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves in a very good turn) is lured to New York City to work for the powerful and persuasive John Milton (Al Pacino in one of the best performances of his career), the world is his oyster. He has a dream job (given to him because as a defense lawyer he has never lost a case), a beautiful wife (Charlize Theron in head-turning performance), and a luxury apartment (which his wife nearly drives herself crazy trying to decorate).<br/><br/>But the longer he is in New York, the more life is not as it seems. His wife is going crazy, he has to defend a wealthy man accused of murder who appears to be guilty, and his boss is the Devil Himself.<br/><br/>The movie has a tension to it that begins with the first scene, and crescendos to the confrontation between Lomax and Milton-and the ending is one of the best in recent cinema history.<br/><br/>Pacino, who is as over-the-top as he's ever been seems to be having great fun with this role-he roars onto the screen and is mesmerizing throughout the film. His Milton is seductive, persuasive, powerful and he draws you in. His monologue at the end of the film is unforgettable and thought-provoking. Reeves gives one of the best performances of his career and his Kevin Lomax is a classic example of a little fish trying to swim in a big ocean with the gigantic sharks. He is vulnerable, but blind to this fact. His values and morals are challenged, and he struggles to keep control of his life.<br/><br/>This is a film that I have seen time and again, and it just keeps getting better. The music and cinematography are simply amazing. This film is a keeper."
"v_haritha_in","7","22","24","11 August 2014"," I saw the Devil!
","This movie addresses the old question; is a lawyer doing the right thing by defending a criminal. However, it finds a novel way of presenting its idea. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves)is a young and successful attorney, in fact so successful that, as we are reminded time and again in the movie, he has never lost a case. He takes up the case of a man who is accused of molesting a child, thinking that he is innocent. Midway through the case, Lomax discovers that the man is in fact guilty and though he is a little disturbed, he helps secure the man's acquittal. Thus, he begins selling his soul to the Devil, both figuratively and literally. <br/><br/>He is immediately offered a much better opportunity at a mysterious organization owned by John Milton (Al Pacino). His job becomes increasingly stressful and he has to defend some shady people. Determined to maintain his record, he abandons his scruples and neglects his wife (Charlize Theron). Can Lomax ultimately redeem himself?<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves does a decent job as the title character but, it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He is a brilliant Devil. His real identity is not kept secret from the audience for long; the movie title and certain incidents give it away. Charlize Theron is spot as a woman descending into madness. Connie Neilson and Tamara Tunie are good supporting villains. <br/><br/>The atmosphere for the movie has been carefully created. The sets are rich but seem to symbolize vanity and are somehow depressing. Most of the cast are pleasing to the eye yet the character they portray are either unhappy or evil. And New York is a perfect location for this tale"

","I saw this movie back in '97 in the theatre. It was running just a week after Cameron's Titanic. I remember the crowds that rushed to see Titanic, and an almost empty room when this movie was playing. After seeing this I thought how unbalanced is this creativity (originality) vs big budget blockbusters on one side, and the number of viewers on the other side. Later I realised that blockbusters are for the masses, and interesting movies like this one are for the few who can see beyond the FX and the small little girls tears. I was just a kid back then. I watched it again last night. And although I knew the ending, it was an awesome ride, and the ending gave me the same shivers as the fist time. If you haven't seen this one - go get it, if you have - watch it again. It never gets old, nor boring."

","What a surprisingly rewarding film. I have not watched a film that is so engaging for a long while. I had never even heard of the film before and only saw it by chance on the shelf at the video store. I am glad I picked it up as I enjoyed every minute of it. The Devil's advocate is heavy viewing, it is not a light cinema experience, yet it is rewarding in it's heaviness. It is very clever depicting the devil realistically and giving a totally truthful example of how people can un-knowingly be sucked in by evil. The film though dealing with a unrealistic concept is totally believable due the the fantastic acting by all involved. Keanu Reeves gives the performance of a life time, he is perfectly cast opposite Charliez Theron who is also very impressive. The two posses an obvious chemistry. I recommend you see this movie ASAP!"

","I can hardly find words to express how grand this film is; superb acting and story, with lot of action, drama and emotion. Director certainly mounted a gorgeous movie, displaying great talent to deal with the theme of men making a terrible deal with devil (though involuntarily)in exchange for money, success and all that stuff. Extremely realistic, never slowing down with one twist after another. Serious, scary and witty all in one, it captures the essence of degrading social values and overrated success of nowadays society. In terms of acting, Al Pacino's rendition of Satana is simply awesome, over the top, a role played to near perfection. Charlize Theron, wonderful, does a good job in playing the forever loving wife, breaking down as soon she starts discovering the truth; the only one a bit disappointing is Keanu Reeves, not that much realistic and believable."
"triple8","9","11","12","15 April 2006"," Pacino, Reeves and Theron in a movie well worth seeing.
","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>At first I thought I was watching ""The Firm"" meets ""Rosemary's Baby"" and gradually realized it was something else entirely. The Devil's Advocate is a really good, quality film that manages to be both highly thought provoking and tremendously entertaining at the same time. I really enjoyed this a lot.<br/><br/>The three main performers are all at their best. This film was made before Theron became such a big name and she is as good in this as everything else she's in. She actually steals the movie a few times and more then holds her own with the likes of AL Pacino.<br/><br/>Then there's Keanu Reeves. Although his performance has received some not so good reviews, I liked him in this role and thought he does his best work here. Keanu is suited to a certain type of role and he was perfect for the role of Kevin. As mentioned, this movie reminded me, at first, a little of ""The Firm"" and I certainly thought Reeves was better in his role then Cruise was as Mitchelle Mc.Deer in ""The Firm"". Just my opinion but I thought it was great casting.<br/><br/>And then there's Pacino. Absolutely and completely superb. This is one of the best roles, if not the best, I have ever seen him play and could anyone else really have been as perfect for the role as Pacino? This was a movie where the casting definitely helped make it what it was.<br/><br/>One thing I enjoyed so much about The Devil's Advocate is how one doesn't know what will happen moment to moment. In the world of movies, it seems the majority are at least somewhat predictable. Not so in Advocate. It was so very nice to actually be surprised. And not surprised once either. The movie has several zingers which I never saw coming and that's a great challenge in movie land. Advocate was definitely up to that challenge.<br/><br/>Then there's the cinematography which was excellent and the story itself which is provocative and thought provoking in it's tale of vanity and human corruption. And though it has a long running time it seems much shorter then it actually is. And the movie has humor as well and that humor makes for some great moments, the conversation between Pacino and the two knife wielding men on the train for example. <br/><br/>Devil's Advocate comes close to a 10 for me, though not quite. There were some plot holes and things I didn't understand. Also, though the humor in Advocate was usually outstanding, it was weakened when the film got a little to campy at times which didn't go with the rest of the movie, especially since so much of Advocate was genuinely creepy. This is probably a film best seen more then once and there are several things that are open to interpretation.<br/><br/>Then there's the ending. Althoughh this is not the type of ending I like In most films AT ALL, for some reason it fit here. And by the time the film ends, one is in such a high state of anticipation to see what's gonna happen, and so into the movie, that it's ending is almost OK. I say almost because I still think the ending could have been a little stronger but that's just a minor complaint. I'd give this a 9 of 10 and really recommend it."

","This is a stylish supernatural thriller about the temptation of evil for a young lawyer from the South. When he is offered a big time job in New York by big time lawyer played by Al Pacino, he finds there is a price to pay.<br/><br/>The cast is good. Al Pacino before he got really devilish looking is good except for the silly dance at the end. Connie Nielsen is sophisticated and elegant. Charlize Theron is moving and convincing as the young wife sacrificing her looks for a standout performance. Even Keanu acts quite well as the young lawyer and you can't say that about too many of his movies.<br/><br/>They didn't make it over the top horror - it's clever and frightening without much gore or in your face violence. Along with Rosemary's Baby this is the best NYC supernatural horror movie."

","Evil promises everything but gives away nothing. This quote, which I like very much, sums up the point of The Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>In this movie skillful lawyer goes to New York to pursue career of his dreams. He makes many compromises with his conscience on the way and even starts to neglect his romantic relationship.<br/><br/>It's really unbelievable that this movie isn't more popular than it is. It's got all the elements of a serious, adult thriller. It is true, however, that this is a very disturbing portrayal of someones life going down the spiral. What makes this movie great, makes this movie disturbing and vice versa.<br/><br/>We've all seen many movies devoting to much time to unnecessary violence only to disturb you, not to utilize it so that story line actually benefits from it. <br/><br/>However, all the violence, nudity and disturbing material in The Devil's Advocate fit nicely with the plot. I don't remember anything disturbing not being in concordance with moral of the story - that is to point out to viewer how the Evil actually operates.<br/><br/>Now recall the book of Genesis chapter 3, verse 1: ""Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.""<br/><br/>Many movies have portrayed Satan as an ugly, violent monster often not intelligent enough. This movie portrays the Evil one as it actually is: intelligent, subtil, patient, taunting, masquerading as the angel of light. And one more thing: He hates God. His true call is to convince people loving God does not exist.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie which provocatively raises philosophical and theological questions in a way a book never could, look no further."

There is a lot of nudity and extreme violence in this movie, but if it wasn't there the movies purpose and story wouldn't work.

","When I first saw The Devils advocate I was in amazement of how good it was. I was thinking about it for a long time after and when I got to catch it recently on TV it made me think about it all over again and it this time raises some questions and.<br/><br/>I didn't find it as good the second time round. I have watched it many times since I first saw but the recent viewing I was paying more attention than ever. I still think Keanu Reeves was maybe not right as Kevin Lomax. He has great moments but I think he has to many moments where he is trying to act is ass off and making it look obvious. Is it me or in some scenes where Keanu is talking he sounds like Elvis with his accent. Just a thought. Al Pacino was perfect as John Milton but again he was a bit over the top but makes up for it in his charm and charisma which he tackles head on easily through the movie. The best acting we get here is from Charlize Theron which is no surprise to me considering how well she has done since in films like Monster. The story doesn't really kick off till the very end where everything unfolds very fast to a massive climax which without this film would have failed badly. I don't know much about Taylor Hackford's previous work but I am impressed with how he handled The Devils Advocate and if he directs an y others films of this caliber then he might be poised to win an huge award of sort. The film is just not about paranormal goings on with Satan, it is also a law film which actually makes being a lawyer look like a lot of fun with a lot of tension thrown in. If any adrenaline junkie wanted to go for a mainstream job then a lawyer would be his cup of tea as Kevin Lomax will show you.<br/><br/>The direction, music, cinematography and nearly everything about this film is perfect. The story is quite close but towards the end there is just to many revelations that happen all to quick and it gives you this feeling that the film is getting a bit silly and that's how I feel about it now. If you haven't seen it before and you are wanting to see it for yourself then you should see it without a doubt. Don't let any review including mine put you off as this as the movie is one hell of a ride but it may raise questions of how much they tried to cram inside the movie in the time it had. It does run for nearly two and a half hours but they run quicker than you can imagine and as soon as the film finishes you will be wanting to watch it all over again so you can see where everything makes sense.<br/><br/>Al Pacino does pack a punching performance to the very end and is as crazy as ever if a little over the top at times but without him we wouldn't be talking about this film as much."

","Pun intended for the title. While not many horror factors are incorporated, the constant subjects of the devil and hell and death are very creepy. But they are fun too.<br/><br/>Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors on God's Green Earth, pulled off very sick devils. As an actor, playing either God or the Devil is one of the highest callings. De Niro pulled off a pretty sick devil in 1987's Angelheart. Ten years later, Pacino dazzles us with his own devil. Reeves is the movie's main character, but it is Pacino that steals the show. While Angelheart is a straight-up horror movie, De Niro's devil is simply scarier than Pacino's, as this is a thriller with a horror undertone. I also found this to be a better movie.<br/><br/>Pacino plays the devil who is the head of the world's most powerful law firm located in New York City. He recruits Keanu Reeves, who's 64-0 record proves he can punish the guilty one day then make the guilty look more innocent than a child the next. Reeves and wife, Theron, move to a lavish New York life, too good to be true. Reeves is unaware what's on the line as everything of his could go straight to hell.<br/><br/>This really gives lawyers a bad name. Sadly, it is true. Sometimes, lawyers can be bad people as they free monsters. This Gothic fairly tale makes fun of this theory in an-over-the-top way, that is thrilling, fun, and scary. This was done before Keanu Reeves sold out and Pacino started doing good and bad movies, so both actors do mighty fine jobs. Supporting actors such as Charlize Theron and Craig T Nelson are just as good.<br/><br/>3.5/4"

","The Devil's Advocate is a great film.<br/><br/>It is full of depth and intriguing story lines, that are impossible to ignore. Even a strict atheist like myself cannot ignore the themes presented, and most of all I can not ignore the interesting way in which it is presented.<br/><br/>Beginning with Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) as a lawyer living in Florida. A prodigy, a man who has never lost a case, and now after his current case, in which he gets a sadistic paedophile off for rape, he's given the opportunity of a lifetime. To go to New York and work for one of the top law firms in the country, perhaps the world. With his wife Mary-Anne (Charlize Theron) in toe, they travel to New York so that Kevin can see what it would be like.<br/><br/>He loves it. A bustling metropolis full of hard cases, and great rewards. Mary-Anne is also in love with the high lifestyle they are set to lead, and the prospect of being able to bring up a family.<br/><br/>Even Kevin's boss seems too good to be true. The charismatic John Milton (The amazing Al Pacino) a slick, philosophical man of sly charms. <br/><br/>At first, Kevin is given a few small potato cases. And he's quite happy with it. In fact he's enthralled, getting deep into his cases, and creating a strong relationship between himself and his boss. <br/><br/>But all is not plain-sailing and peach blossom. Kevin starts to work more and more, and begins to neglect his new wife, who begins to freak out in her new surroundings, and her new home. Of which she becomes to be convinced is haunted with demons, and such beings...<br/><br/>Poppycock? Not quite. Kevin is assigned a murder case, and after a couple of banters between Milton and himself, it seems that he still isn't willing to drop his work for his wife. He continues on, unaware of just how bad things can get, if you allow yourself to be overcome by your own, selfish desires. Even, Kevin's mother tries to make him see sense, and look after his wife, of whom before she had no liking for.He still doesn't listen...<br/><br/>Kevin finally does win his case, and manages to get the murderer off the hook... but it's gone too far. His wife snaps. She claims that Milton had raped her, and in a particularly tense, distressing scene of confession in a church, in which she uncovers her scarred body. She is taken to a hospital for the insane, to try and regain her rationality. But before that can happen she kills herself. A final shattering blow for Kevin.<br/><br/>And now, he begins to believe things are not as they seem. His mother addresses him about Milton - He is his father... and not who he seems, in the slightest. Enraged, Kevin goes after Milton, even at his mother's plea not to--- <br/><br/>""Behold I send you out a sheep amidst the wolves...""<br/><br/>---She cries. He leaves the hospital... The New York streets suddenly deserted, in a surreal shocking moment - (28 Days Later Anyone?)<br/><br/>He gets to Milton's penthouse suite. And the talk begins... Who really is Milton... And what does he want?<br/><br/>Well, I think I've spoiled enough... I won't spoil this. Just take my word for it when I say that the following conversation, is controversial, quotable, and extremely moving. Great dialogue, crisp acting and fantastic direction... An eerie mix of fire-soaked settings and dragon-tongued discourse.<br/><br/>Yet you may ask, why not spoil this bit. I've spoiled everything else. Well, the thing is, the film as a whole, from my conversations about it etc. Seems to be rather underrated. It lacks recognition in some respects, or so I feel. And so why bother advocate more for it when I want you to see it for yourself, and understand why the film is great. It is this ending that is the great thing about this film. Everything that leads to it is almost trivial. Necessary to the plot, and the outrageously good shock at the end, but still trivial. It is this scene that makes me think - why is it underrated? <br/><br/>To be honest, I can't think of a reason -<br/><br/>Some claim Reeves can't act his way out of a paper bag. And that Theron is just too overly weird. And that Pacino hams it up by going over the top...<br/><br/>Well, personally I don't think so. I think each character has their own dimension, and that the overall film - (but especially the ending) - is most exciting.<br/><br/>So I highly recommend this - I advocate for it, and give it it's recognition, before thinking about downgrading this magnificent work for such menial drawbacks---<br/><br/>The film ends. Milton is chuckling... The credits role, to the sound of The Rolling Stones: Paint it Black.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The chemistry of the two male lead actors in this show was incredible. The movie line done very well, as the characters were developed with tremendous care. What a couple of actors to put together, Reeves and Paccino. A remarkable work on the vice of vanity. Purely and enjoyment only movie, it is one to sit back relax let it twist your mind around the plot. As we see the plot of good versus evil taking place in the bible belt south, and the avarice life of the north where the two cultures meet, in their diversity and grow together as partners. The main role characters do well on their own, but we must not forget the bible banging mother, the wife who gets bored with success, then the father who ends up being Lucifer himself.

","You will never hear the devil's viewpoint argued better than in and by The Devil's Advocate. Although Keanu Reeves holds his own in this film, this piece of cinema is an Al Pacino show.<br/><br/>Pacino must have loved playing the devil, it shows in every word, in every gesture in his performance. Since Marlowe and Goethe cooked up Faust, the devil has had a great group of players taking on the part. People like Ray Milland, Ray Walston, Walter Huston have all done well with old Scratch, but no one ever tops Pacino in this.<br/><br/>That's probably because through cultural and religious restraints, the devil HAS to lose in the end. In this film, it's not necessarily the case. Keanu argues the Bible says he loses in the end, but Pacino says quite properly, consider the source.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is a hotshot trial lawyer from Florida who has rung up sixty three acquittals of various folks arrested. He's come to the attention of a very powerful law firm, headquartered in New York and they want to take him in. The senior partner is Al Pacino, a most mysterious fellow who moves among the rich and mighty with ease.<br/><br/>Just how powerful Reeves has no idea and why Pacino is so interested in him particularly is also a puzzle. The reasons are quite shocking when he finds out.<br/><br/>Although a talented supporting cast was gathered for this film, Pacino just overpowers this group with his performance. Even Reeves who actually has more screen time can barely keep pace.<br/><br/>And the ending has to be seen to be believed. Let's just say that old Scratch has more tricks in him than Harry Houdini, David Blaine, David Copperfield and all the rest of that magician crowd put together.<br/><br/>As he says, vanity is his favorite sin, it apparently is what trips mankind up every time, individually and collectively."

","Hot-shot Floridian defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is head-hunted by New York's most powerful law firm, unaware that his new boss (Al Pacino) is The Devil.<br/><br/>For The Devil's Advocate, director Taylor Hackford breathes fresh life into several well-worn satanic horror themes, skillfully weaving them into a slick, big-budget horror/thriller that delivers on many levels: it's smartly written, sexy, intelligent, and well-acted, with a particularly fine, lip-smacking performance from Pacino, who owns every scene he is in. Above all else, though, The Devil's Advocate is thoroughly entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>The film is perhaps a little light on scares and gore for some horror fans, but there is a genuinely creepy atmosphere to compensate, the script is gripping and imaginative enough that one soon forgets about the lack of stuff like bowel-loosening jumps and exploding heads, and to top it all, Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen both get completely starkers. Great stuff!"

","This film exceeded my expectations, that's for sure. I thought the ending was a -little- disappointing, which is why I didn't give this film a 10/10, because it was obvious that reporter was Satan, he gave that away earlier in their discussion, and after all Kevin had been through, it was unrealistic that he wanted to go onto 60 Minutes first thing in the morning, but other than that, it was surprisingly excellent. <br/><br/>I already knew Al Pacino was very good, nobody plays Satan as good as him (See ""End of Days"") and he still blew me away with his incredible performance. However, I was also surprised at how good Keanu Reeves' acting was in this film! We always knew he was a particularly wooden actor, had trouble showing emotions, but he was amazing in this film. 9/10."

"brandon_lee420","9","6","7","10 March 2010"," What an awesome experience!!!!!!!
","I remember watching a scene from The Devils Advocate when I was nine years old but 3 years later (Which is right now), at the age of 12, I had the chance to watch it......... the whole movie this time. My money was well spent on this film. It had everything you could ask for from action to horror to thriller and FUN. Right from the start I was hooked as Kevin Lomax, played by Keanu Reeves, was defending a teacher who had molested one of his students. You also learn that Kevin Lomax will do anything to stay at the top and won't let anyone beat him. Kevin Lomax is a very fun and hardened character. He is mysterious and competent while also being a very fun character. But it's too bad that he is going to go through hell after meeting John Milton, Satan himself, who is actually Kevin Lomax's actual father. John Milton, played by Al Pacino, is very SATANIC and mischievous. He has money, wealth, women, and powers that are beyond heaven Get it? Al Pacino was the real show-catcher hear with his character and this performance MIGHT be one of his best in a long time after Scent Of A Woman. He acts smoothly and at times he doesn't even look like a human. Good work, Al! Oops! One other thing about Al Pacino is his laugh. It is funny and dangerous as well. He uses his chuckle throughout the movie but at the end when he reveals his real self and later chuckles, it is that when he gets you.... real close. Taylor Hackford was a nobody to me, I didn't even know him, but after seeing this true masterpiece he has become a somebody to me. HE did a good job in direction and has made the second best movie in 1997 after ""The Mummy"". Sorry to all Mummy haters. It just worked a little bit better than this. Andrew Neiderman has told a blood-chilling story which will be hailed forever. Some people will find this scary and some even funny? I don't know why! The film is not so scary but it doesn't need that. Whats even better is that it was not needed at all.The film could have still scared me without that. At occasional times you will see some characters faces turn into demonic like and that can scare some people. At the end when you see a little bit of the real devil you feel tense and shaken. At least I was!<br/><br/>After hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax gets the attention of John Milton, who is his father, he thinks it is a dream come true. But dreams always come with a price. In order to live stylishly, Kevin has to work for him in return as his lawyer. His mother isn't so sure about it but still lets him. She is a good Christian who has a revelation of her own. Work is going fine when he and his wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), start experiencing something supernatural. Not knowing if it is real or not they decide to ignore it. They should have packed up and gone home living happily but they made a mistake. Then deaths occur. Mary Ann starts deluding and has to be in a mental hospital where she cuts her throat and dies. At the end, Kevin can continue the ""Family"" by giving Milton another son but instead he shoots himself in the head. Just when you thought that Kevin has died, it was all a vision. Kevin trusts his vision and decides not to go to the life he saw in his vision. He decides to do an interview with a reporter but doesn't know that John Milton is actually pretending to be the reporter. When the film ends you can her Milton Chuckle.<br/><br/>The films atmosphere is strange and moody. It is a good match with the movie. The music is good as well but sometimes doesn't match the scene. The film was not perfect but it did come close and for that it will be in my DVD collection FOREVER. This movie deserves to be viewed by everyone at least once and I hope you don't get disappointed after viewing it. A fine film made for fine eyes! 9/10 - awesome!<br/><br/>""Over and Out"" 10th January 2010."
"nightcrawlercyp","10","3","3","4 December 2011"," a different view
","I thought the movie is great, but i did not see it as many people do. I did not see it as a way to put a dilemma between good and evil, but to show us how easy is for us to lose control over to the demonic forces.<br/><br/>One of the first parts that you see if you look close enough is that the two main characters (the couple) are gradually changed by the people around them (that are portrayed as demonic minions) to become as them. The first change is when the wife wants a green wall, but the evil neighbor convinces her to go with another color. Then we see as the times passes by that the matter if the husbands clients are guilty or not or how horrific their crime is becomes less and less important to him. The only thing that matters becomes to win, or rather said have the impression he won.<br/><br/>The second is a vague sentence the devil utters while he kills one of his subordinates: ""People have reached a point where they consider they are they're own god. This world is out of control"". This means the pride of the people in this world has become so great that they have no more control over themselves , but they become easily controllable by him.<br/><br/>In the end the devil presents his defends, where he mixes truth with lie to become the innocent one. He says that God gave humans the instinct to do evil, the free will to do it , but commanded him not to. Although it is true God gave humans the power to choose between good and evil, he did not gave man the ""instinct"" to do bad. To give a quote from the Bible ""our fight is not against flesh and blood (i.e it is not in our nature to be evil) but against the dominions , the powers and the principalities of the darkness of this age that inhabit the skies (i.e. the temptations and illusion the devil creates)"". Next the main character asks the devil one important question: ""Why should I bother, since you are destined to lose?"" The devil answers: ""Yeah, but look against whom we go against!"". Another important question is: ""What do I have to gain in this?"" The devil answers: ""Everything you want. Happiness as tap water."". In reality this is a lie. The devil can only give a faded illusion of happiness or pleasure. If you leave the things settle just a bit the illusion starts to fade and it becomes bitterness. Also this is only for a limited amount of time.<br/><br/>Another part is the now famous ""look but don't touch..."" that being attributed to God. In fact this the devil's mo. He understand you cannot transform a man who loves his wife into a person that could cheat without remorse (for instance) in one move. He does things gradually: first he says: ""It is OK to look, you are not doing anything bad"" then ""it is okay to have sexual fantasies with that person it is just natural"" then ""it is OK to make an 'innocent' sexual joke once in a while"" then ""it is okay, just happened once, you where a little drunk, the wife was ignoring you, don't worry about having sex with someone once"". then says: ""If you did once why would it be wrong do do it again? and again? and again?..."" and in the end he says: ""don't you see it is in your nature? you cannot get rid of this behavior! You might as well enjoy it!""<br/><br/>At the end the devil is asked ""What about love?"" Since the devil cannot actually experience rue love anymore he answers it is overrated changing the notion of love with the notion of sexual attraction."
"Al_The_Strange","8","5","6","22 October 2012"," Vanity, definitely my favorite sin.
","I was initially dismissive of this film; it was only the ending I truly enjoyed, thanks to Al Pacino's epic speech, Keanu Reeve's epic solution, and all the epic special effects that came out of the woodwork (or stonework as the case may be). While those few things jumped out at me, I regarded the rest of the film as a rather dry and boring procedure, bogged down by all kinds of dialogue and drama.<br/><br/>Upon repeat viewings, I learned to appreciate the film more. It does break up the monotony with the occasional fright scene, the occasional bit of sex and violence, and some interesting stylistic flourishes.<br/><br/>Above all, the story is very interesting. It does a terrific job of tying together courtroom drama with theology, drawing parallels with universal morality and cosmic justice. Thanks to the film's fantastic conclusion, it pulls it all off sublimely, and leaves enough room for thought and interpretation. The plot is well-developed, characters are decent, and the occasional subplot helps reinforce the overall story and drama.<br/><br/>The film has solid photography and editing, even if it does seem a little plain at times. Acting is fantastic: Al Pacino easily steals the show as the title character, while Keanu Reeves does his best to be earnest, and Charlize Theron flexes some impressive acting muscle. Writing is quite smart. This production has fine-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is not bad.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)"

"alexkolokotronis","6","36","67","1 March 2008"," The Devil Inside of All of Us
","The Devil's Advocate was just something different. It did not try to be deep and certainly did not take itself seriously making it good. It fortunately just follows its own path and throws you into a whole different world.<br/><br/>The acting in the Devil's Advocate was average. Keeanu Reeves was horrible as usual but Al Pacino fit his character perfectly. He seemed to have more fun with this role more than any other movie he has been in. He portrayed all the temptations we have inside of us. He kind of gave a glimpse of what type of person you would be when giving into those temptations and how it will just transform into something that is not human at all. Charlize Theron also gave a very interesting performance as she falls apart because of her loneliness and paranoia. The only problem I had with her performance is that she seemed as if she had some sort of southern accent at the beginning but it quickly vanished as you get deeper and deeper into the movie.<br/><br/>Directing, cinematography and writing were all good. Especially the cinematography making you feel as if not only the characters becoming more and more corrupt but as if the camera in which is looking into this story is being corrupted as well. So much of this happens it feels as if this movie just spins out of control which is probably a mistake of the director.<br/><br/>This movie does not portray the devil as a horrible crime riddled thing. It shows that the devil is inside of us and that devil is our temptations. Are temptation run through every little thing; Money, power, relationships and anything else that could give us a thrill. It shows that if we give into to our temptations it will not only reflect ourselves but become us."

","Devils Advocate is probably the best Hollywood movie of the 90`s, and surely the best Hackford`s film. The plot is fantastic and the cast is great.

Amongst all the characters, I was mostly pleased with Al Pacino's performance, as not only he plays a vicious role, but also his humorous comments were brilliant. Keanu's performance however was mediocre, I thought he could do better. As for Charlize Theron, as this was one of her first films, I think she did a very good job of playing such a serious role at the age of 22.

Of course Al pacino is great. I especially like the part when he talks about the god. Charlize Theron is also very charming. She manages to look like a depressed woman.

"QueenMakeda84","Null","4","5","22 March 2004"," Incredible
","What an insightful film. I can watch this over and over again and not get tired. Al Pacino is the dude of acting! lol It goes a lil something like this: Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer who's never lost a case. He's married to a follically challenged woman named Mariann (Theron) and they're happy as clams. John Miller (Pacino) hears about Kevin's streak and decides to recruit him. They go to NYC and are wined, dined, and bribed into accepting a job as a criminal lawyer in a network of top global lawyers. Once they start living the life and Kevin gets all his clients acquitted for their criminal deeds, things start to go haywire. Mariann starts to see demons in their friends and realizes she can't have the baby she desperately wants. She feels alienated and out of place while Kevin works. She eventually goes crazy, but only because she's seen the truth. Kevin is taken under the wing of John Miller and gets caught up in lying for his clients to maintain his perfect record. All is not what it seems as people start dying and Kevin finds out that he's the son of the Devil. As a child of a Bible-thumping mother, this creates a problem. Miller wants him to start a ""family business"" with his half sister (whom he secretly lusts) and basically wants to p*** God and all the angels off with the lack of justice in the world. I liked that this movie made people realize that the devil can be real and out there affecting forms of governments and other systems of power. This is obviously a movie, but the message to me is still clear. It was a unique angle to attack an age-old debate from. Satan is in the law? American law? Hmm....pretty interesting stuff. Sure would explain a lot and don't mention O.J. any of you, lol. Point is, the movie is fabulous and decadent and shows how vanity can be a deadly sin and probably Satan's favorite according to Pacino. Theron attacked her part wonderfully and made a fan out of me. She's absolutely stunning. Greed is a serious issue and this movie discusses that. It's a must see and they have it on TBS and TNT all the gosh darn time, so just watch it."

There is love between them but there is something more than this in Lumax's mind that is beyond the boundaries of relationship. The questions and moralities of sin, love and lust are blurred in his head. He is the winner, the unbeatable and the irrepressible..... well that is what Lumax thinks! How this unravels throughout the film in an enthralling fashion keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats (or the sofa).<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves as Lumax is top notch. He has been underrated throughout his career but does the role to it's perfection. Charlize Theron as his wife has done brilliantly well. Considering she was so young at that time both in terms of age and career, the role is quite complex and she nails it. Al Pacino is class. The subtle change in his mannerisms quickly within scenes is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Production is excellent with just enough amount of CGI used to justification.

The confrontation at the end is just an instant classic scene, amazing in every way. And I might be kicking in an open door here, but Al Pacino is a very good actor. His portrayal of Milton/Satan is perfect, he's threatening and dark but you can still buy that people trust him, it's a subtle performance that makes this movie. However, part of this story seems a bit contrived. Why are these protagonists so extremely excited about moving to New York? They nearly faint when they see their new apartment, I'm having a difficult time believing a Florida lawyer winning 64 times in a row has is that bad back home.

But the message is good, very good and maybe society needs to be spoon fed to see these matters clearly. This is all about how materialism sucks up your soul away from the precious, most precious things in life that you got to hold on to and give prime importance to. Not because super sexy Al Pacino will come along in what may very well be his peak act as a bad guy, because here he plays THE bad guy with a good explanation and speech/lecture abut a lot of spiritual concerns from the Devil's point of view. Anyways I always thought lawyers to be the scum of the earth. And they could have chosen someone better that Keanu if you ask me, but he is OK."

","Young hotshot attorney Kevin Lomax has a perfect winning streak in court, a beautiful wife, and after winning his latest case - which initially looked hopeless - in defending a sexual criminal, he is offered to come out to New York to part of a powerful law firm. It is all that a young attorney would ever dream about, but things are not what they seem.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves gives a good performance, probably his best as of yet, as Kevin Lomax and Charlize Theron is typically good as Lomax's wife who slowly slips into schizophrenia. But the real show stopper is Al Pacino, as John Milton, in what can only be called a terrifying performance of pure evil that makes Gordon Gekko look like a girl scout doing community service. Al Pacino is not short on tour-de-force performances, but here he gives the world another one.<br/><br/>The film is superbly directed by Taylor Hackford with an increasingly intense atmosphere. Inserting demonic imagery and haunting theme, you'll be wondering just what the hell is going on... right up to the devilishly clever climax. 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, strong sexual content and profanity"

The beginning of the movie starts off great, where he defends a teacher accused of molestation. I bet he felt real stupid when he sees his client playing his ""instrument"". He should have dismissed him right on the spot! The Lomaxes (Reeves and Charlize Theron) get the opportunity to go to the Big Apple simply because he's the best. There's a hitch, his employer is so shady, not only he will win every court case, his soul is the most important thing he has own. This movie is a little more hardcore than ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" with temptations that are to good to be true. Mary Ann Lomax is starting to dislike being in New York, because the new friends she made, turns out to be more sinister, than Kevin would ever see. The part where the friend took off her bra so she can put on her new dress then Mary Ann rushes out of the store when she saw the demonic look in her. After finding out who his business partner really is, Lomax decides to tempt the devil, himself. It was better to stay and find a new line of work than to enjoy a job opportunity that carried a heavy tag. This movie was very sinister, very entertaining, and very intriguing, I could watch this movie at any time I want. GREAT! 5 STARS!"

","Satan has been portrayed as many things in cinema, but who would think of Satan heading a top New York law firm? <br/><br/>This film adaptation of the book does, and it's very entertaining. It shows the slow seduction of a talented, young,  small town lawyer who never lost a case being sent to New York to help a 'big' law firm win their cases. He gets involved in the money, the power and everything ole Satan can throw infront of him and his marriage as a carrot. Reeves plays the title character Kevin Lomax well, and Al Pacino is 'divine' as the head of this law firm who really is 'you-know-who'. Charlize Theron is as cute as a button for in this roll she needs to be, and she delivers on the tough acting side as well. This film contains very adult subject matter, it delivers fine acting performances from all the other actors and actresses as we the audience wonder why is Satan interested in this lawyer, specifically.

","The Devil's Advocate is by far one of the better films of the 90's. When I first saw it almost three years ago at the theater, I said movies and film making have come a long way, when a film such as this is wily outrageous. Al Pacino has a field day playing Lucifer disguised as the head of a New York law firm. Pacino's characther of John Milton has a member of his law firm recruit hotshot Florida defense attorney Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) to New York City to practice law for his firm, but soon does Lomax and his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) learn not only are there cases to be won, but souls to be lost. Pacino gives in my opinion the best performance of his career, the name Milton is always associated with Satan hint: Milton's Paradise Lost. The Devil's Advocate gives us a message that some of us are simply chosen for certain roles in life. Giving into free-will can be a pain, but it is a must, because a person cannot always uphold the wrong side for argument's sake. Every one must watch this film over and over to get a more clear and better understanding. I tend to have different thoughts and questions each time I view the film."

","One of the best movies already made, even my grandma thinks ''Devil's Advocate'' is a masterpiece. This movie is based on a book, but sadly I didn't read it to know if the facts are identical or not. But whatever, even if somethings were changed, I cannot say anything bad about this film, where Keanu Reeves has one of his best roles as Kevin Lomax and Charlize Theron became famous. The story is about the young lawyer Kevin Lomax, from Florida, who never lost a single case in his entire life. One day, one day, a very famous law firm in the world, call him to work for them. Kevin's mother,Mrs. Alice Lomax, disagrees with the idea about Kevin going to New York, but he accepts the offer and the money that comes along with his cases. Becoming rich and powerful, he did not pay attention in what's happening around him, including his wife Mary Ann. His boss John Milton, seems to always know how to overcome every problem, making things for Kevin, in a way, get worst and worst. But the true is, that a big secret is around Jonh Milton and Kevin.

","How many times do we do something wrong and rather than take personal responsibility we find an excuse, usually, ""the devil made me do it""? This compelling story about an attorney who must win at all cost shows that man is not some puppet being controlled by an invisible force. We have choice and can choose good or evil. Our choice depends on our motivation, on our prerogative, usually, what is best for ""me"". God and the Devil, aware of this human trait, exploit it to their enjoyment. What else do you think they do for fun? No matter what choice we make God or the Devil wins. There are only two choices in life, good or evil. We must choose one. The one great thing about this film, is that it re-asserts for me that we are never forced by God or Satan to act. We are merely presented with opportunities and we take our pick. Perhaps God and the Devil keep score. I believe they are very competitive in nature but would not go as far as to choose for us. There would be no fun in that now, would there?

Or, have you ever asking to yourself why does Satan always make us do wrong things ? have you ever blame Satan ? Well... The Satan will answer those questions in the movie.<br/><br/>Regardless of the movie's premise, we all actually know that Al Pacino is a great actor and he didn't disappoint me. One of his best performances was his monologue about the idea about himself (as Satan) and The God, it was so iconic !<br/><br/>Charlize Theron was great too. She transformed herself from a happy-stable-life wife who loved her husband to a clueless rich wife, losing her husband attention, getting crazier and crazier overtime as she saw demonic vision of the people around her, which was ironic because she was the first one who realize that satan's is actually around her.<br/><br/>And Keanu Reeves, good. The first time I know him was from The Matrix and John Wick. The characters he played were quite similar IMO so there is nothing special. But I saw a different character from him in this movie, although the differences weren't (again) that special. But overall he acted well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie has some flaws and a little bit confusing (if you are a hard-thinker and a plot-hunter) but if you focus on the premise and curious about what will happen as the movie goes by (of course you should because this is a mystery movie), this won't be a problem."

Keanu Reeves, one hell of an actor who apparently doesn't listen to advice when it comes to picking roles (The Day The Earth Stood Still remake, Johnny Mnemonic, etc.), found the right role with Pacino. The two of them go hand in hand like ham and eggs. For the toast and orange juice, add Charlize Theron and Tamara Tunie, and don't forget the strawberry jam, Jeffrey Jones as Eddie Barzoon. This cast is perfect, and the story moves quickly to keep you caught up in the action. Pacino, master of the soliloquy, is magnificent, and seems to enable the rest to bring their performances up to his level. Nudity, violence, sex, and language all make this a pass for the kids, but the grown ups ought to enjoy it. Collectible for the Pacino lovers, not so much for the rest."

","The devil's advocate is an interesting film in that it starts as a ordinary drama before becoming increasingly strange. It poses moral questions which can feel slightly pushed in your face like many American films and it certainly isn't subtle however it contains a great Al Pacino performance that builds the film up above what it would have been with a lesser actor. Keanu Reeves is a little boring here sometimes feeling a little off in his role but never nosedives into bad performance territory. The scrip works well and builds up to stranger and stranger events some of the dialogue also is done well. I am sure that many will not like the ending and many others will. I myself found it satisfying as the film was always leading up to a over the top conclusion and Al Pacino's look into the camera at the end was frankly awesome. So a good film if your willing to let some things fly and enjoy it for the slightly silly fun movie with a great character for Pacino."

","Even though Taylor Hackford isn't the most famous or best-known director in Hollywood (he has only directed 13 movies until now), he sure deserves everybody's attention. With his latest movie ""Ray"" he became very popular, but even with movies like ""Dolores Claiborne"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"" he has proved to be capable of making some great movies...<br/><br/>""The Devil's Advocate"" is a movie about Kevin Lomax, a young, seemingly unbeatable lawyer from a small town in Florida. When he gets the chance of a lifetime to work for a big law firm in New York, he doesn't have to think twice. Together with his wife Mary Anne and against his mother's approval, he accepts the offer, and the money and immense apartment that come along with it. But soon Mary Anne starts feeling homesick and begins to dislike the city and Kevin's job as he pays less and less attention to his wife and she starts to witness devilish apparitions. It seems to Kevin like she is loosing her grip on reality, but soon enough he'll find out about John Milton's true identity and the reason why he wanted Kevin as his protégé...<br/><br/>What I like most about this movie, next to the excellent portrayal of this fine story, is the performance of Al Pacino. He plays that role of Satan so excellent, that I'm convinced that there isn't any other actor who could have done it better than him. That refined, devilish and charming character of John Milton, together with Pacino's facial expressions is absolutely brilliant. But Al Pacino wasn't the only actor in this movie of course. The other actors did a very nice job too. Keanu Reeves is nice to watch as the hotshot lawyer and Charlize Theron's fine performance was very prominent in this movie, even though she had a smaller role.<br/><br/>As I already said, the portrayal of the story is also very nice. There are people who say that there was too much nudity and sexual content to be seen in it, but personally I didn't have any problems with that. Yes, there is some nudity to be seen and yes there are a couple of sexually inspired scenes, but than again, this is a movie about Satan, not about God. If you want to see little cherubs flying around, I suggest you try another movie. But even though the entire movie and its story are very nice, I was a little bit disappointed by the ending. It isn't bad, but somehow it seemed a bit like the ending had to be done in a hurry, because they didn't have much time left. The rest of the movie has been well developed, but the finale takes only about ten minutes. Still, don't let that make you think that the movie isn't worth to be seen. It's a very good movie with some very nice acting and a clever story and that's why I give it an 8/10."

But still (till that moment) it's a thrilling movie that deserves to be seen. I wonder how someone who can produce such a masterpiece didn't understand how he messed it up in the end.

"thehumanduvet","9","3","4","4 May 2000"," Wall Street meets Angel Heart - impressive moral tale
","Very surprised and impressed by this film, which I really hadn't expected much from. Pacino goes for a far straighter devil than de Niro's in Angel Heart, and where he misses out on de Niro's egg-peeling creepiness he more than makes up for in bulgy-eyed intensity. He also out-charms Michael Douglas' moral black hole in Wall Street. The movie is very effective, following the old evil-is-something-you-do-not-something-you-are track, and all the more intriguing for setting its story not too far from reality. OK so not every corporate bigwig is in league with the pointy-tailed one, but most of the stuff that went on here wasn't all that fantastic (until the final few scenes) - a bored housewife slowly goes mental, some nasty people do some nasty crimes and try to get off with an expensive lawyer, people doing stupid things get in trouble (running across busy streets without looking, running alone in dodgy parks, trying to pick a fight with Al Pacino...). Keanu is the man put in the position of being offered masses of cash to do things most people would think of as immoral, something which happens all the time in this world...Those around him are callous and vicious, hardened by the high pressure, low moral world of the extremely wealthy. Pacino's devil is more like a metaphor for the corrupting influence of wealth, greed and power than a supernatural religious creature, a bad influence sitting on everyone's shoulders telling them what they can have if they're not too scrupulous about it. A well-told fable on the dangers inherent in exposing the souls of mankind to vastly greater wealth and power than their fellows.<br/><br/> On the downside, Keanu's accent seems decidedly weak even to a foreigner, and it very nearly blows it right at the end, I almost expected Peter Ustinov to start dancing with some children it was so pat-Hollywood-happy-ending, but it saved itself with a killer last line. As to all those people complaining about ""excessive"" violence and nudity, it was actually a lot less gory than I'd anticipated, with just a few brief moments, mostly involving Charlize Theron, which were very graphic and quite harrowing, but had to be there to give a clear idea of how 'horrific' the world can be, and the nudity was important too - lust is as compelling a desire as greed, one that often involves as much cruelty and abuse of others, and can if unleashed from the conscience lead to great evil. This surely needs to be shown as much as anything else, and all those prissy little puritans upset by the sight of a pair of tits should just grow up, get over it and check out what this has to say about the things you should really worry about. Don't let that ending get you down though."
"kenjha","6","4","6","4 July 2010"," Guilty as Sin
","A hotshot Florida lawyer is hired by a powerful New York law firm. Pacino is tailor-made for the role of the larger-than-life owner of the law firm. Reeves is miscast as the whiz kid lawyer who's in for more than he bargains for; his performance is so wooden that one can see every acting muscle being flexed to no avail. Theron and Nielsen are fine as the love interests. The film is reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but is not as compelling as that film. Starting with an intriguing premise, it is engaging enough for the most part, but becomes increasingly ridiculous, including a contrived finale that seems to have been tacked on as an afterthought."
"tributarystu","7","9","19","27 May 2007"," Divinity on a Leash
","Eternity and entertainment, how could one exist without the other? True entertainment only comes without limits.<br/><br/>Seeing how my recent obsession with Charlize Theron has intensified in the last few weeks (may be the rather appalling effect of stress and responsibility which makes me want to elude reality), I got around to seeing the so renowned Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>The film as such is a fun ride and, by all means, very well done. It's in the artistic impression it conveys to life and the reality of its tone in the first half that this advocate succeeds in defending a case so easy to lose (forgive the pun). While subtlety may not be its prime method of going about things, the vicious devilishness of the world fits very well in the picture. Yet, it is mainly Charlize's performance which caught my eye and soul, a performance so ""tormentous"" it simply made the film worth the watch. My bias is obvious, but I sincerely hope this opinion goes beyond personal taste. Morevoer, it is not only in her performance, but also in her character and its drama that the film gains depth and tension.<br/><br/>Keanu's Lomax, although the central character, never manages to truly get off the ground - as in, it never gains true distinctiveness. It would be erroneous of anyone to deem Keanu a brilliant actor, but there's always something more to acting than simply having the skills to do it, that is why I did not mind him being chosen for the role. Actually, he is only the ""vehicle"" which gets this film moving, but its value lies more in the peripheral happenings, the little things.<br/><br/>As a whole, Devil's Advocate may attach too much of a moral label to itself to actually fulfill its potential. It is however a clever film, with some good performances from both Charlize and Pacino (who does his usual tricks to amuse everyone), but which descends into dangerous territory towards the end. And it's not the right kind of dangerous territory."

","I had watched the trailer for this insipid mess many years before I actually tried to watch it tonight. I had always heard that it was terrible but I had no idea that it would be terrible because of its supposed point of view.<br/><br/>Forget all the nonsense you hear about Keanu Reeves giving the worst performance of his life. He is just fine. The problem is that his character is so stupid and oblivious to what is happening until the very end. And when he finally gets it, the plot thins with a spectacularly insipid finale or as I would like to call it ""tacked on ending"". It sort of reminded me of the end of ""Basic Instinct"", although less subtle.<br/><br/>If you are so inclined as to watch a bad film do so for Al Pacino's final scene. It is so steeped in over-the-top acting, but it's kind of funny how much he invests in it. Do not see this film to get some real insight into religion or for that matter, the law or the American dream. If Taylor Hackford, the director, was trying to make a point about lawyers equaling devil worship, then I think he was about 20 years behind schedule. Even an episode of L.A. Law got that point across more succinctly.<br/><br/>I do not regret seeing this, though. I make it a point of seeing something shallow every two months or so. Then I switch to The Bold and the Beautiful for some really insightful storytelling.<br/><br/>Note: The last remark was meant as a joke. I do not find The Bold and the Beautiful nearly as insightful as Melrose Place."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","15","36","9 May 2006"," The Good & Bad Of 'The Devil's Advocate
","BAD - Is there a dumber-sounding or more wooden-voiced modern-day actor in Hollywood than Keanu Reeves? In this film they have this guy playing a super-smart lawyer. I'm sorry but he just sounds dumb, his voice and vocabulary giving no indication of him being a brilliant lawyer. Maybe it was his fake Southern accent, which also was weak.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron was in there for looks, playing Reeves' wife. Her tirades and constant OMGs got tiresome after awhile. Meanwhile, Reeves' mother (Judith Ivey) was portrayed as a preacher's daughter and, of course, a strange almost- nut-case-like person, which is how Hollywood usually portrays Bible believers. <br/><br/>THE GOOD - Al Pacino was his usual interesting self, particularly since he played the devil, so you know he's going to have some dialog that will get your attention. Ivey, even though pictured poorly as mentioned above, is the only one with enough Biblical knowledge to know Pacino was the devil - not the other characters. Being a guy, Theron was nice to look: a stunning-looking woman. <br/><br/>OVERALL - If you put with some of things mentioned above - or if a lot of profanity and full frontal nudity turn you off - the story is interesting and still worth a look. Even though the films goes on a bit long, the best part is the final 30 minutes. Even though perverted, the Devil's ""take"" on life and God are fascinating to hear. The movie also provides a good moral lesson on the subject of vanity."

","The Devils Advocate is a film I thoroughly enjoyed even though it does have Keanu Reeves in it. I'm not Keanu's biggest fan  but loved The Matrix and Point Break and somewhat surprisingly its his performance which made me like Devils Advocate. The film had plenty of surprises and Keanu gives his best performance yet, even if Pacino did appear to be on autopilot throughout the whole film. However Theron is the real star of the show and her mental and physical decline is harrowing to watch.<br/><br/>One interesting part of this film is that as you watch you don't know if its going to suddenly turn into a full horror like the omen or persue the more obvious thriller route. At times Keanu does look out of his depth in the acting department, especially next to Pacino and Theron but he carries the film well.

There is a lot of nudity in this picture, but I think it is warranted. I mean the devil deals with matters of the flesh in this film. The nudity, sex and violence are all tastefully done and never exploitive. Al Pacino plays Satan with calm and confidence. Keanu Reeves holds his own with Pacino and puts forth one of his best performances. This film isn't afraid to tackle it's subject head on and I liked that very much."

"pfgpowell-1","2","14","34","1 May 2008"," Half an idea is underdeveloped as Hollywood takes the easy way out
","In an odd sort of way, The Devil's Advocate typifies what is wrong with so much Hollywood film-making today. To put it simply, there is just far, far less to it than meets the eye. Ostensibly it has so much going for it: Al Pacino, most certainly, and then Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, who as actors are both well the good side of mediocre. Reeves,especially, is far better than his reputation as a brainless, though good-looking, piece of meat would suggest. The are other things about this film which are not half bad: the central conceit of the Devil (some of us still feel that old bounder deserves an upper-case D) operating on Earth as a lawyer had potential, insulting though it is to your common or garden lawyer. Then there are the nuts and bolts of film-making. It is handsomely made, with the expected expensive Hollywood production values, and the early scenes 혰 for example, of Reeves in court where his ambition take second place to his scruples and integrity, and later where Pacino's Devil tempts Reeves to throw in his lot with his hotshot law firm 혰 are promising, and you are intrigued just how it is all going to pan out. The scene at Pacino's 'office' at the top of a New York skyscraper complete with what seems to be a small lake in the sky is rather good (and recalls, as it is supposed to, the temptation of Christ). Yet finally that is pretty much it. Characters aren't developed and there is no discernible storyline. The first hint that the hotshot law firm might not be all it seems is when Theron, the young lawyer's wife finding her feet in uptown Manhattan thinks the sees the face of her new friend briefly morph into that of a monster. But this isn't really followed up, either, and exactly why Theron should so suddenly crack up, more or less overnight, is raped by Pacino and finally cuts her own throat are never explained. What the Devil is up to masquerading as a the very rich boss and owner of a Manhattan law firm is also left unexplained. At one point there are vague references to all the evil in the world and how Pacino's firm represents the interest of arms dealers etc etc but this is done in such a throwaway fashion that it is hard to escape the conviction that the target market for this hokum are the Western world's morons. This is lazy film-making at its laziest. Characters and ideas 혰 or rather 'idea' 혰 are simply left undeveloped and any exposition of the central theme of evil in the world and how it flourishes because man's vanity and a lack of a moral compass is not just two-dimensional but one-dimensional. Too much about this film is strip-cartoon like and every last single element of its potential is wasted. After a very promising start it gradually dawns on the viewer that there is simply no point this film. It is not frightening, there's no horror, there is no thought, there is no development and there is no tension. It doesn't hang together and what ideas there are are simply thrown in to flatter those who might think they have half a brain. If they think that this film is in anyway good, then they will have all the proof they need that they don't. The very final scene is very odd indeed and would more naturally belong to a comedy, but nothing which has proceeded that scene would ever make you believe the film is intended as a comedy. Finally, the way the central idea and its potential are wasted is a great shame because Pacino (who never gives a bad performance, not even in downmarket nonsense like this), Reeves (who suggests there is quite a large acting talent there which still largely remain untapped) and Theron (who does rather well despite a hammy script) are rather good."

","So, in this film they pair one of the the greatest actor of all time, Al Pacino, with the worst actor of our generation, Keanu Reeves. The premise is audacious and intriguing : no matter how terrible your crime, no matter how obvious your complicity, Kevin Lomax can save you from conviction. He's a brilliant young criminal defense lawyer with a small problem : he has a conscience, and a very real one. With every case he wins, his personal guilt mounts, because he is all too aware that all his clients were guilty....<br/><br/>Soon, Mr. Lomax gets a call to the big boys' club, in the form of an enormously powerful law firm in New York. He is befriended rather quickly by his new boss, John Milton, a fiery, enigmatic and strangely charming man who always seems to know things the others don't.....<br/><br/>Lomax and Milton's first meeting, on a designer rooftop, is spectacular, both visually and symbolically. There's an elevator scene where Lomax's mother and Milton meet, which is one of the eeriest things I've ever seen. TDA sets itself up beautifully, and then like most other films blows it all to hell. Now who else but a criminal defense lawyer with a perfect record would get a call from Lucifer, right ? It sounds perfect, metaphorically, and it IS perfect, but instead of taking the film in that direction, it turns into a freak show (i.e. cheap-thrill-type horror). Its an engrossing film that runs out of steam just when its getting interesting, and the final act is bizarre and anti-climactic. Too bad. This could have been a truly great Al Pacino film...."
"raulfaust","7","3","5","28 March 2011"," Entertainment as it is
","""Devil's Advocate"" is a very entertaining film that somehow managed to interest the spectator with ease.<br/><br/>It deals with the conscience in the laws, specially at lawyer's job. I feel it has a good critic concerning this kind of lawyers that care only about the money, instead of caring about the word justice. As a law student, I believe that this kind of lawyers are the reason many outlaws get away with murder and cause most of the problems of our society.<br/><br/>Despite that, this film is much more entertaining than rational. I personally prefer ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" because it has a very good debate involving faith vs science and has much more scary scenes than this one. For pure entertainment, stay with Devil's Advocate; for entertainment and a little more, watch Emily Rose's."

","The Devils Advocate is a good thriller with flaws from director Taylor Hackford whose admirable in making this movie about a hotshot lawyer who gets a lot more than he barged after when he learns that his new boss is Lucifer himself. Keanu Reeves is solid as Kevin Lomax the hotshot lawyer and Al Pacino is better than ever clearly enjoying his chance to play Satan. Reeves makes for an effective hero and Pacino is great as the villain. I just wish he had more to do. The rest of the cast including Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielson, and Craig T Neslon are good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The movie is creepy occasionally with some suspense and surprises but a slow pace is what weighed the film down the most. If director Taylor Hackford had amped up the suspense and made it faster paced somehow the movie would've been better. The few surprises near the end I didn't really see coming but it couldn't hide the movies few flaws. Overall though The Devil's Advocate is a decent thriller thats creepy with some suspense, surprises, and exceptional performances by the cast who make this overlong movie worth watching at least once."

","This is a film that is almost ""great."" I had a few gripes, primarily the issues with Keanu's inconsistent accent. <br/><br/>Very much ""Rosemary's Baby"" meets ""The Firm."" <br/><br/>A decent, enjoyable film, but not a great one. Al Pacino was very good portraying his character, but Keanu... It's just his voice, man. Something about how forced and ""cool"" he's trying to sound while putting on and off a Southern accent is something I can't stand. <br/><br/>Story is decent, but not quite as epic and intense as the mood was going for as well. <br/><br/>Still worth a watch, but it's not up to the standard it sets itself up to face."
"Howlin Wolf","7","2","3","26 November 2007"," What's your Price?
","When you're in the mood for something unsubtle but visceral, it pays off to give ""The Devil's Advocate"" a spin.<br/><br/>I have to admit it has a style that's relentlessly 'over-the-top', so to some that might be a turn-off, but I like it because it's really easy to watch. It has a nice flow to it, which must be down to Hackford's direction.<br/><br/>Plus, you get to see Al Pacino chewing scenery! Everyone criticises his 'shouty' acting, but it makes me feel really alive when I see a performer get that passionate in their work. James Woods is another guy who has that manic quality going on, too, and it's riveting when they're in full flow. I can't take my eyes off them.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is often mocked for his lack of expressiveness, but this time his casual manner is the perfect foil for his co-star's maniacal air of mischief.<br/><br/>Ultimately the movie abandons all attempt at any kind of moral/legal parallel by the finale, choosing instead just to give Al space for his personalised, paraphrased riffs on Paradise Lost material, so if you're expecting consistently sensible and thought-provoking, then you're probably at the wrong gig. If however you only seek to be lavishly entertained, then surrender to your inner hedonist and dive right in. You may not respect yourself for it in the morning, but hey, tomorrow's another day.

But some really great work also came from Charlize Theron, who I've heard of, but not seen before, and Connie Nielsen, who really burned up the screen. Judith Ivey deserves mention, also. SEMI-SPOILER AHEAD: I thought that the movie would have been MUCH better if director Taylor Hackford would have ended the movie at the end of the penthouse scene, rather than adding that last part. It would have been unexpected and powerful. The last scene had commercialism plastered all over it. It cost the film one point in my rating. Grade: B"

"Explosionman187","7","1","1","24 June 2020"," Kind of disturbing actually
","Al Pacino is charismatic as the Devil himself in this movie, in that fake plastered on charisma you get from salesmen sometimes, but with dark, deep dominating eyes. He comes of powerful, intelligent, extremely manipulative and slightly unhinged insane, you could actually believe he actually is the Devil. Keanu Reeves plays his role very well, being this talanted, charp and very cocky up and coming lawyer, that just can't put his own ego aside. And Charlize Theron perhaps has the hardest part and pulls it of without a sweat. I think it's actually that her peformens is so convincing, I actually became a bit emotionally disturbed by this movie, otherwise it wouldn't been nearly as effective.<br/><br/>Some beautiful shots of Manhattan, New York. This mighty metropolitan of a city, fits very well for what the message of the story is telling. And that the lawfirm, the story takes place within, is on the top floor of a skyscraper, looking out over the entire concrete jungle, really potrais what it's all about in a subtle way: power over others.<br/><br/>It's a story about morality; the battle within, doing what's good and right versus the allure of success, no matter the cost on everything else. ""Money, that's the easy part."" As Al Pacino character says in a scene between him and Keanu. Not the first movie with that kind of message, but still original in a way, usually Satan himself is not involved as a real character for example. The title of this picture, that it's both allegory and litteral, is actually a tiny bit genius. Pacino also has a great monolog in this film.<br/><br/>This movie could be labeled a thriller or a drama but I think it's actually a horror movie. The story starts of a bit slow in the beginning. And becomes more and more creepy as it moves along. A creepy slow burn horror movie, which is refreshing today, when most horror movies is about jump scares. It picks up way more towards the last act. But I actually didn't like this movies big finale that much or the ending. There comes a twist that I didn't really care for that much or felt necessary either.<br/><br/>Other then that, pretty good. Decent. It reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby actually. But Rosemary's Baby is better, but still I think this movie is very decent and it actually managed to disturb me, which I think was its meaning to do, so it succeed, an accomplishment for Taylor Hackford. Decent movie."
"BlueSkies765","10","1","1","23 June 2020"," Best of the best
","What a way to tell a classic tale of evil. Kevin Lomax (what a name right?) is a brilliant lawyer who gets an offer to work in New York. Here he gets seduced by power and prestige.<br/><br/>The movie is very captivating. Tall larger than life buildings where multiple times you have characters standing at the highest level of the building. This serves as a metaphor for the devil being on top of the world, the movie got a lot of these references. Also the special effects are creepy but it's subtle, feels very unique and stands out in the movie. But the story also lures you in. A small step at a time Kevin gets more invested in his less admirable vices and makes the wrong choices. If it's not the prestige from being a success in stunning New York, there's always the lust that consumes Kevin. As Milton says he sets the stage, but Kevin makes the choices. I've watched this some time ago but when you watch it again you see how subtle he gets lured in.
The devil was working on Kevin from the beginning. To add insult to injury it was also Milton who while being there to corrupt Kevin is also the one advising him to not make certain choices.
I loved the pacing of this movie. Kevin slowly being hypnotized throughout the movie with a great third act (this is where movies usually fail). And there's great performances from so many people."
"stefannemanja7","10","1","1","31 May 2020"," Analysts...
","Most movies about lawyers involve selling your soul to the devil, but ""Devil's Advocate"" is the first in which the devil gets more dialogue than the lawyers. The movie chronicles the descent of Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a small-time legal star from Florida, into the depths of the New York big time. Recruited by a powerful Manhattan law firm, he finds himself defending goat-killers and real estate tycoons for a boss named John Milton, who offers him a paradise found.<br/><br/>Milton (Al Pacino) is the devil. That is a secret reserved for the second hour of the film, although the title hints it, the posters and TV commercials reveal it, and by the time it arrives Lomax is the only character who hasn't suspected. Charming, persuasive, with a wise little cackle, Milton sends a recruiter to Florida, where Lomax is an undefeated master of picking juries that do not convict. He wants the young man to join his team, and tempts him not on a mountain top but on a rooftop.<br/><br/>The scene of the first meeting between Milton and Lomax, on a skyscraper roof, scores a stunning visual impact. The production designer, Bruno Rubeo, has created a spectacular effect: A water garden in the sky, with pool surfaces spilling over the edges of the building, so that water and sky seem to meet without any architectural separation. The two men walk perilously close to the edge, as the director, Taylor Hackford, plays with vertigo to suggest that Lomax is being offered all of Manhattan at his feet--and also the possibility of a great and sudden fall.<br/><br/>The young lawyer is impressed. So, at first, is his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), who can't believe it when Milton offers them a three-bedroom apartment in a luxurious Fifth Avenue co-op. Only Lomax's Bible-quoting mother (Judith Ivey) has her doubts, quoting scripture about Sodom, Gomorra and other keywords that pop into the mind when Manhattan is mentioned. Her advice, indeed, seems increasingly sound as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Lomax becomes obsessed with his job, ignoring his wife and drawing closer to a sexy woman at the office (Connie Nielsen). And the wife, obsessed with having a baby, begins to come apart. She has the film's first supernatural vision, when she sees a demon materialize in the face and body of a helpful neighbor (Tamara Tunie), and soon she's begging to go back to Gainesville.<br/><br/>The satanic character is played by Pacino with relish bordering on glee. Reeves in contrast is sober and serious--the straight man. That's the correct choice for his role, but it leaves Pacino with many of the best lines (""I'm maybe the last humanist. The 20th century was entirely mine. I'm perking!"") ""Devil's Advocate"" is neither fish nor fowl: It is not a serious film about its subject, nor is it quite a dark comedy, despite some of Pacino's good lines. The epilogue, indeed, cheats in a way I thought had been left behind in grade school. And yet there are splendid moments.<br/><br/>I liked the way Hackford used speeded-up photography, as in ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" to indicate the passage of time. The way Milton's office looks like Satan's might look if he had a great designer. The nice little throwaways as when the goat killer (Delroy Lindo) apparently causes the prosecutor to have a coughing fit. The casting is good in small roles, including Heather Matarazzo, from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" as the victim in an early courtroom scene. But the movie never fully engaged me; my mind raced ahead of the plot, and the John Grisham stuff clashed with the Exorcist stuff. Still, I enjoyed Pacino. Looking less deeply wrinkled than of late, his face smooth with Satanic self-contentment, he relishes the details, such as that Milton likes to stand in front of fires and always travels by subway. The phantasmagorical final confrontation between the two men, set to the Sinatra version of ""It Happened in Monterey,"" ranges from melodrama to camp (""You're the anti-Christ!"" ""Whatever."") It includes an extraordinary special effect of a marble bas relief that comes to life and melts into a licentious orgy. If the whole film were as good as its production design, we'd really have something here."

"david_rudy_lee","10","1","1","5 August 2019"," Great Film About the Choices We Make
","This was a film that I remember when it came out, but I didn't see it for some time afterwards. I did see it in high school with some friends, I believe after I saw Scarface where I fell in love with Al Pacino and his acting abilities. I know that I saw it again in college, but it really wasn't until this viewing when I watched it a critical eye can I fully appreciate it. The synopsis is an exceptionally adept Florida lawyer is offered a job at a high-end New York City law firm with a high-end boss, the biggest opportunity of his career to date.<br/><br/>We start in a courtroom. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is the defense attorney for Lloyd Gettys (Chris Bauer). He's a high school teacher who is accused of molestation by a student. The student's testimony is pretty damning and Kevin looks at his client while she is testifying. He knows that everything she is saying is true. When the witness is turned over to him, he needs a short recess. It is in the bathroom that he speaks with Larry (Neal Jones), a reporter, who asks him for a quote as he is about to lose his first case. Kevin comes back into the courtroom and puts reasonable doubt in the jury by calling into question the motives of the student. Gettys goes free.<br/><br/>At a local bar, Kevin celebrates with his wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). On his way to the bathroom Kevin is approached by Leamon Heath (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), who offers him a job with the law firm he works for in New York. He accepts and he tells his mother, Alice (Judity Ivey) before he goes. He doesn't want him to New York, calling it the new Babylon and we see that she doesn't care for Mary Ann either. The job is to pick a jury for a case up there. It ends up working out, even though the attorney who is in charge of the case disagrees.<br/><br/>This gets Kevin a meeting with the head of the firm, John Milton (Pacino). It turns out to be a negotiation as Milton wants to start a criminal division. Kevin and Mary Ann are moved into the swanky apartment building that Heath, his wife and Milton all live in as well. When Kevin is introduced to the firm, Christabella Androli (Connie Nielsen) catches his eye. The first case that he is given involves Phillipe Moyez (Delroy Lindo). Kevin dives into this and starts to neglect his wife. Mary Ann falls into depression as she loses her husband over to his work. She also has doubts to if that is what he is burying himself into.<br/><br/>When Alice comes to visit and catches a glimpse of Milton, she is uncomfortable and doesn't want to stay in New York. Milton catches on to this and goads her a bit. Kevin doesn't seem to notice though. It all takes a turn though when major client of the firm, Alexander Cullen (Craig T. Nelson) is accused of killing his wife, stepson and maid. Kevin is given the case much to the displeasure of Eddie Barzoon (Jeffrey Jones). This takes up even more of Kevin's time as his wife descends into madness and starts to think that those around her aren't as they seem.<br/><br/>Now I wanted to recap as much of this film as I could without going too much into spoilers. Coming into this most recent viewing, I knew some of the reveals, but to be honest, there were some that I didn't remember either. This film actually ticks a lot of things that I've come to loving in films, especially the perversion of religion. I don't know if I had read 'Paradise Lost' or not at the time of my last viewing, but I love that nod for those that know what that epic poem is about.<br/><br/>The title of this film is something that is really a great allegory and foreshadowing for the film. I personally tend to be the Devil's Advocate when I'm arguing with friends, because personally I like to ensure that both sides of a topic are explored to fully understand it. Kevin though is also technically doing the devil's work by getting those he is defending off with reasonable doubt. Kevin is a scumbag, but then again, he's doing what he's tasked with. This becomes a moral debate for defense attorneys, do you protect your client, even if you know they're guilty or do you do what you think is right? This again comes up when he's defending Cullen.<br/><br/>What I also love about this film is exploring the seven deadly sins. It is interesting that earlier in the decade; we had Se7en, where the killer is using these for his grand plan. Here we are seeing Kevin and the other lawyers in the firm living out their fantasies as well as committing these. Kevin is a victim to vanity, which he wants to win and he wants the glory. He is also prideful, he experiences lust for Christabella as well as greed. Milton at times gives him the option to give up what he is doing, but Kevin exercises his free will to continue on what he's doing. I just really love this, tying it back in with my previous point of the use of religion.<br/><br/>Now there is the issue with this film, which happened a lot in the decade, of whether this is a horror film. If you know me, I will try to claim as many as I can for my genre, which again, I do think this is horror. We have metaphorically and literally in the film the devil. We have those that are committing heinous crimes and getting away with them. On top of that, we have that lawyers could be doing the devil's work by allowing criminals to get away with it, which could be the devil's plan. Rick Baker did effects in this film to make demons be represented as well. We don't know if this is something that the people are hallucinating, but that also brings up the horror concept of the descent into madness.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the pacing of the film, where I never really found myself bored, but the film is quite long. It runs two hours and twenty minutes if you didn't want to look up what it was. It would be hard to cut things from this film though, as we have to see Kevin's fall from grace in his pursuit of his career, equally seeing his wife descend into madness as she is corrupted as well. I will admit, I forgot how it ended, but there is a quick little thing at the end that I did like. It really did recover for me there.<br/><br/>I want to move next to the acting of the film, which I think is good for the most part. I hate to do this, as he is such a good guy but I don't like Reeves in the starring role of the film. He does give off the arrogance necessary for the lawyer aspect. He doesn't give me the emotions that I need though. I can see in the end why he was chosen, but I just feel there could have been someone better in my humble opinion. Pacino is great though. I love the character he portrays and everything he does. He is great at disarming and then convincing them to commit the acts they do. Theron is also great and gorgeous in this film. We do see her nude, which wasn't bad either. Nielsen was solid in her role as well. I want to give shout-outs to Ivey, Nelson and the rest of the cast. They definitely rounded out the film for what was needed. It was crazy to see a young Monica Keena as well here. I had to look it up and confirm by checking out those scenes again.<br/><br/>That moves me next to the effects of the film. I do think that some of it was CGI, but where that was used it was fine. It really is small effect and some of it being that faces distort. I think the look of the demons was good and seeing that Baker did them, I'm not surprised in the least bit. The film is also shot very well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I forgot how much I really like this film. Seeing it this time with a critical eye, this film does things I really enjoy in films. The perversion of religion is something that makes me enjoy films even more if I'm honest. I like how this is presented in seeing a character ruin themselves with the choices they make and the descent into madness of those around them. The acting really helps bring this to life, even though I don't feel that Reeves fits. The film is a bit long, but it is hard to find things to cut out though. It doesn't get boring and the ending works. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but it also never took me out of the movie so I have no issues there. Some might argue this isn't horror, but I can contend that it is. Overall I think this is a really good film and would recommend this for horror and non-horror fans alike with its message."

In every frame here he convinces you that he is Satan. He gives the role the edge it needed and his performance makes this movie supreme. The direction is impeccable.

","I must begin by quoting other users by saying it's a shame the rating isn't higher.<br/><br/>I am giving the reasons but only after saying that it's a shame to spoil your pleasure of seeing it, so no comments on the synopsis.<br/><br/>First of all, the leading actors are remarkable... Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for his part, but let us not forget Keanu Reeves. HE CAN PLAY! And he is most convincing, too.<br/><br/>As for the two lovely ladies, Connie Nielsen and Charlize Theron (in strictly alphabetical order) are perfectly chosen and also playing beautifully.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the production design (oh, and also the music) create the perfect atmosphere of a perfectly shot movie, a movie transcending the genre (horror) and sliding beautifully in the hardest genre to express: drama.<br/><br/>To conclude, Al Pacino really shows something we all know: he is one of the greatest there is!

The mind blowing dialogues at the climax of the movie will make you give a second thought while praying to god .Pacino's trademark expressions and duologue delivery are the best part of the movie . Charliz Theron had done her work quite satisfactorily but there nothing much for her in the movie. Go for it . A worth to watch . The theme of the movie is not very new but a very nice modern version of the same war that had been always between the good and the evil. Has some real twists which make it really interesting."

","I have always loved Al Pacino as a villain. I can do without Jeffery Jones, Craig T. Nelson and even Reeves. Theron was good in this movie as the wife who was confused and insecure. But, without Al Pacino as Lucifer, this movie would have been garbage. It had a decent at best script and a not-too-surprising twist at the end. But, what I remember most of this movie is Al Pacinos' rants about god. ""Apsentee landlord"", ""Sadist"", ""Worship that, never"". It was interesting to see how Lucifer might view god as the villain, punishing men for their choices. You can look, don't touch, touch, don't taste, taste, don't swallow, and while your jumping from one foot to the next, he's laughing his sick f&*#(*& a** off."

Of course, this isn't the first time that the Devil has been portrayed as just a man, Ray Milland did a wonderful and sinister turn in Alias Nick Beal and Walter Huston played the role with abandoned glee in The Devil and Daniel Webster. Even Ray Walston did a merry turn in Dam Yankees. But it took Pacino to really ham it up and make us enjoy every minute of it. Since I really don't believe in ""the devil"" I just enjoyed the story and Pacino and even Theron, I just wish she had done something! with her first name. It's a nice fantasy, and yes, vanity is by far my favorite sin. :)"

","Kevin Lomax is a rising young star. He's a slick-talking, intelligent lawyer, and he's never lost a case. So he figures it's time to move up to the big city, join a big firm, and enjoy great success and make a lot of money. But the firm he joins is full of greed and malice, and his boss, John Milton, is an eccentric hotshot who is acting very strangely. He begins to become alienated from his wife, driven just by money and fame, and just when it seems like everything he cares about has gone to waste, he finds out the shocking true identity of his overzealous boss...<br/><br/>'The Devil's Advocate' is a very entertaining story about fame and vanity and the evil places it can lead one to. Keano Reeves does a fine job portraying the young attorney. Charlize Theron is phenomenal as his pretty wife. But it is Al Pacino who (not surprisingly) steals the show, acting out the mysterious and strange boss.<br/><br/>As the movie reaches its' climax, Reeves and Pacino confront each other in a scene that's gotta rank up there with one of the greatest in motion picture history. Pacino's diatribe about God is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>My only criticism of this film is the overdone goriness of some of it's scenes and the unnecessary lewdness portrayed.

","OK, let me just get this out of the way Al Pacino is one of the most under-appreciated actors of all time. He has only been given one Oscar in his entire movie career and he has deserved at least three. Same with Robert Deniro, but he won two and he's not in this movie. If you don't get a Oscar nod for what he did in this movie I do not know what the Academy is looking for when it comes to Best Actor. Do you have to be in one of the best movies or most controversial movies to be considered for a Oscar. It's ignorant and moronic on the part of the Academy. Especially since 1997 was a very weak Oscar year. A nod is all I'm asking for, just a nod. He didn't deserve the award, but damned if he didn't earn a nomination in that final scene. Giving everything you could possibly think the devil could do to lure you into his world. Make you into what he wants and turn your world upside down. He even ups the performance of Keanu Reeves to the point where that accent isn't even bothering you anymore. Your actually feeling the turmoil and what exactly is riding on his decision and it's all Al Pacino. The Academy wanted Pacino to look but not to touch, well OK they let him touch, but very rarely a taste, OK a taste but never a swallow. And thats how it is. A great actor gives a great performance and devils in Hollywood just play a huge joke on him. I think Dustin Hoffman has been nominated enough don't you? Watch this movie the ending is enough, but the rest is great too. Interesting story and amazing visuals."
"jason_13","10","1","1","19 March 2006"," Pure Greatness!
","I guess I am one of the very few people who find the movie much superior than most thrillers considered as cinematic masterpieces. Yes, I find The Devil's Advocate better than let's say LA Confidential.<br/><br/>As a court room thrillers fan, I cannot hate or not like that movie. The story follows a young lawyer Kevin Lomax played by Keanu Reeves who turns out to be a great lawyer and gets sent to New York for his first real big case. He is about to get married and so Kevin could be the happiest man on earth. The man he gets sent to is John Milton played by Al Pacino. A man with style who appreciates Kevin's achievements by far and he admire his enthusiasm and of course, he sees a lighter future in Kevin. After all, a great lawyer could put anyone out of great situation. Milton is in fact his new boss. New Yor, beautiful wife, fame, prestige, success. Of course nothing could be perfect for one human being. Not in life, nor in movies. Strange things starts to happen with our main character, the people he knows become different. His life is about to become a nightmare and it turns out that Milton is some kind of a living on earth Lucifer.<br/><br/>One of the greatest ""lawyer"" kind of movies, plots ever. The movie is much more of a deep drama with dark and unexpected moments, then a thriller with an optimistic, smiling and happy lawyer who saves the day for wrongfully accused innocent looking guy. The movie hides a great cliché among its deeper meanings. Fame's fatality. Kevin's character is a provincial guy with innocent understanding for his life, with no imagination or great brain. In fact, he is nothing special, but he is a lawyer who wins cases and people love him. He is lucky, God has ""touched"" him and everything works fine until he commits a sin by celebrating his fame, becoming a new person with higher standards, different attitude to his friends and wife. He becomes a whole new person that God does not love anymore. Well, I think it might be kind of a metaphor. He has been in heave all his life, you know what I mean and when he commits the sin, he fells in hell without realizing it and John Milton is the devil. And because the most part of the movie takes place after he becomes the new person, that kinda symbolizes who the devil is playing with him and how he turns his life into a nightmare. That's the devil's job after all. For example the scene with the baby playing with insides. These are basically the things you realize if you look into the movie deeper. It's great, cause it's full of clichés about degradation and wrong life if I could put it in that way, covered with metaphors and symbolisms and the movie is fresh and original as a final result and in my case, I loved it.<br/><br/>As for the acting. Bad actor and one of the greatest actors alive. Eccentric and fun combination that could challenge people watch the movie only for that particular reason. Well, Reeves gives all he got and I could easily say it's his best performance by far. He plays the same characters, but this time, his character is given life, his character is a normal human, his character is based on a book character. I could list many reasons why an actor I hate, a bad actor gives a good performance in a great movie. And as for Pacino - I was surprised he had taken the role so seriously. The final duologue scene is probably the best in the movie, mostly cause of his acting, his ability to keep the balance between overacting where he has to and be himself where he wants to, improvising. Exactly what a devil in human form, would be.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 - almost no flaws."
"Bimskaiser","9","1","1","10 March 2006"," Too bad...

Need I say anything about Al Pacino?? The man is an acting GOD (or Devil:) he should have gotten an award for this picture. Keanu does everything I guess what was expected from him, it just seems, he's so uptight and he lacks the necessary looseness and improvisation for this type of movie. He gets the lines desingned for him pretty good, but he's somehow missing the lines in between the lines. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, close to reality in terms of the lawyer business, even the lifestyle of New York is captured, the best thing about the movie however, is still Pacino's performance and the thin red line throughout the movie, which would give away the ending if one would watch VERY VERY closely!"

"ksundstrom","9","1","1","2 November 2005"," Vanities of the bonfires: a riveting film
","Vanity fuels the clash between good and evil. The film is so superbly photographed, remarkably played and directed that you are easily sucked into the flammable issues and charged scenes, potential ""bush fires"", with your emotions taking control. Only after the film may you have the time to reflect. The young lawyer from Florida, Keenu Reeves, who is winning all his cases vainly thinks that he is in control of himself. His acceptance of a fabulously well paid legal job in New York where the world is so much brighter, richer, intriguing, challenging only fuels his vain belief in his legal superiority. The legal firm's boss, Al Pacino, mysteriously encourages Reeves to fly higher, to feel that he can be even stronger and go on winning. Lawyer Reeves beliefs, formed from his religious upbringing by his religious mother, are insidiously tested by Al Pacino. Is winning the only star to follow, what about losing? If God is for love and compassion, is the Devil's role, as advocated by Al Pacino, to inject vanity into intuition to power the business world to winning ever better results no matter whether the world thinks otherwise? A real dilemma for Americans, as its must-win role is corroding the international political world. The good Reeves is threatened by the need to make difficult choices. His falling for the temptations of mastering the situations opens the door to evil paths. His wife, victimized by devilish hallucinations and her doubts that love and compassion are strong enough to withstand the temptations showered on her husband by Al Pacino, increases the pressure on him. The hyper modern business interiors, the stunning shots of New York, the very beautiful women as diabolic temptations inject more fuel into the rising tensions. Serious questions begin to crackle and smolder. The powerful acting controls the potential fission. Reeves is drawn in to the bonfire, vainly believing that he can handle the conflicts and unexplained deaths that pummel him. But Al Pacino's role succumbs also to vanity! Al Pacino cannot either avoid the bonfire of evil ambitions. Brilliant last scenes justifiably disturb the mind. Masterfully convincing acting by Reeves, Charlize Theron his wife and Al Pacino with the beautiful photography make this film a must to see."

","What an extraordinary film! And I don't mean just its artistic or technical side, but also its spiritual meanings. Of course, the story is great, the directing is great, the acting... Al Pacino, Keanu, Charlize. Oh, by the way, and I loved it how they had dissected the American myth of the successful lawyer (but it's much, much more that that). Anyway, back to my point: remember that great scene when Milton explains almost literally the mechanisms of corruption and self-degradation, while walking in the streets with his young ""pupil""? If it was only for that key for salvation in everyday life and the movie would have been a must see! Well, when I had left the cinema, I heard two guys commenting on it: ""Wow, the system is so perfect, you can't get away"". Exactly the opposite of my thought! And then I recalled the saying of the Revelation, which goes something like that: he who is just, let him be just, and he who is corrupt, let him be corrupt. In other words, people had made their choices, the time has come. Well, are we really living the last days of our ripe world as we knew it or what? Very intriguing."

","This is an amazing films for many reasons. Fistly the amazing performance from Pacino. He brings an unashamed, manic, crazed, chain-smoking quality to the Devil, and his portrayal is completely believable. Surprisingly, I found Keanu Reeves' performance fine, despite having disliked him in other films - he does the job that needs to be done - an ambitious lawyer, who for some reason (is it just because of his skill?) has never lost a case. Within the first few minutes, he comes across a moral dilemma (whether to continue fending a maths teacher who he knows is guilty of harassing a teenage girl), and he basically says to himself (without speaking, he checks his teeth in the mirror, as if to tell himself, ""look, I'm a layer, this is what I do - I'm going to defend him as best I can""). And wins the case. The story is an incredible moral tale, because in the end he does do the right thing, and defies the devil (although the closing shot is of Pacino and we know he might get to him again).

Having tried to watch almost all of his films (i have a few still to - Serpico etc) i can honestly say that this is his best performance ever. The whole devil thing just suits him so well - think Scarface and Godfather 2 mixed. I think they must have done something with his face because he give the most sinister looks ever known.

","""The Devil's Advocate"" is an excellent allegoric film about human vanity and the dangerous paths it can lead. Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a very successful lawyer in a small rural town. At some point, he finds himself in a case defending a professor accused of child molesting, whom he realizes that he is actually guilty. Despite his hesitations, he finally accepts to keep the case, and against all odds, he wins it; this immediately prompts a job offer by a big law firm in NY. As soon as he goes there with his wife Mary-Ann (Theron) he is immediately impressed and awed by his new employer firm, and especially by its charismatic yet somehow eccentric senior partner, John Milton (Pacino). Everything is very fascinating in the beginning, as Kevin and Mary-Ann are enjoying their newly acquired riches, while Kevin is speedily climbing the ladder of fame and success. However, he quickly realizes that things are not what they appear, and Milton is much more devilish than he first seemed; too devilish, in fact...<br/><br/>Al Pacino gives a great performance as always, while Keanu Reeves is also very good in his role. However, Charlize Theron is the one who definitely steals the show, with her acting as confused and progessively destabilized Mary-Ann being really amazing; the scene in the psychiatric clinic especially, is one in which she shows her big talent. The direction is also very good, integrating the natural with the ""paranormal"" elements of the film in a very concrete and effective form.<br/><br/>There are many reasons to watch this great film; among them, I would mention Pacino's fantastic and well-placed quotes, such as: ""The virtue of the devil is in his loins!"", or ""Vanity is my favourite sin!"". 9/10."

"patygirl_df","10","1","1","27 February 2000"," Polemic and sensational
","An excellent story line, brilliant performances and amazing sequences made this film a surprising success in 1997. The director Taylor Hackford transformed the Andrew Neiderman's novel into the most incredible story about human weakness.<br/><br/>The film stars Keanu Reeves as the lawyer Kevin Lomax that receives a great offer by the unpredictable John Milton (Al Pacino) to work for his big company in New York. He and his wife Mary Ann (the young and talented Charlize Theron) leave Gainesville and see their lives transformed into the most terrible nightmare. The dialogues between Kevin and Milton are extraordinary, specially the last one when the Devil says that Kevin was responsible for every bad thing that happened to him. God gave us free will and he could have made other choices, but he was too ambitious to do so.<br/><br/>Although the story line is terrific, the best thing about this film is Al Pacino. The star of `Scent of a woman'(Oscar for best male performance) is simply perfect as John Milton. His performance is so convincing that I have seen the movie more than five times just to admire his talent and that is why I recommend it."

How can you not like the end of this movie?  It's great, next to the Usual Suspects it has one of the best endings (although it wasn't as surprising as the Usual Suspects) in a movie in the 1990's.  I think people should give a little more credit to everyone in this film, even Reeves, I am really not a Keanu fan but he is perfect for this roll, hell he looks like he could be Pacino's son (at least in this movie).

","While this movie does depict graphic violence and nudity and is generally disturbing, it is important to note that this is the most accurate depiction of Satan I have ever seen.  After watching this movie you might feel the need to RUN to church or just generally feel a little unclean, but for anyone wondering about what Satan is really like, this is a must see. Pacino is his usual brilliant self, depicting John Milton (no, not the author, but very appropriate for those familiar with Milton's writings). Keanu Reeves actually performs very well in his role as Kevin Lomax and shows that even the most ambitious people have their limits. Finally, Charlize Theron delivers a break-out performance as Mary Ann Lomax, Keanu's wife.  She quickly thrust herself onto the scene as the sceptical wife. Overall, this is a very good movie, well made, well acted, and very well directed.  For those who have a stomach for strong violence/sex or for anyone who has any curiosity of who Satan is and how he acts this movie is a must see."

"svswinger-2","10","1","1","29 November 1999"," Unbelievable, Al at his best
","Being a huge Al Pacino fan, it is hard for me to choose only one of his movies as being my all-time favorite. Scarface would have to be near the top of the list, the Godfather movies were good (not as great as most people think, but pretty good nonetheless), Heat was underrated,and Sea of Love was solid. But if I had to choose one, this movie is it. Pacino is awesome throughout the entire movie, and his two monologues directed at Keanu are as gripping as any others in movie history, no other actor could have pulled it off. He seemed born to play this role. I could go on all day about Pacino in this movie, but others deserve mention as well.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out if I like Keanu Reeves. I try as hard as I can to dislike him, because I really don't think he is a very good actor. However, he seems to choose his roles carefully, because he manages to find himself in terrific movies every once in awhile. He will forever be Ted searching for an excellent adventure in my mind, but Point Break was as entertaining as most action movies get, Speed (yes I know, it was completely ridiculous and stupid) was still pretty cool, and there's always Bill & Ted. But he has really outdone himself here. While overwhelmed by Pacino's performance, Keanu still quietly gives a pretty good performance as the lawyer who sells his soul for the big bucks and glory associated with a big New York law firm, at the head of which is Pacino. I won't give away any more of the story, because it is too good to hear it from me. But anybody who has not seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it. Even if you don't enjoy any other part of the movie, Pacino's monologues and every scene he's in, for that matter, make it well worth the money. Pacino's best, and one of the best of all time. 10/10"

Keano Reeves was as usual- ok, but he was pretty good too. Charlize Theron was actually very good in my taste. The plot itself was very good yet twisted, the near ending where Keano... well I won't say, but when there is all the fire was very good and the freakiest scene of the movie. Though the real ending (the last scene) kinda confused me, though it was good. All in all this is a movie worth watching, but keep in mind that it's twisted, weird and pretty dark. 7 out of 10."

","Lets get things right and sparkling clear. The devil is not red, does not have horns and doesn't carry a pitchfork around. No-no-no, not so. Taylor Hackford's version of the devil is an omnipresent, omniscient Al Pacino with enough charisma to seduce a rock, enough malevolence to make the movie a very scary experience and enough humor to make you grin and even laugh. Keanu Reeves is at his best as Kevin Lomax and so is Charlize Theron as Kevin Lomax's troubled wife. The movie is long, but the two hours get by rather fast. The ending is...well, it's two endings in one. It seems that Hackford wanted to end his movie with a happy end and with a not so happy end at the same time (to please everybody in the audience, perhaps?). Otherwise , the whole movie is a thoroughly enjoyable experience, although it might leave the most sensible viewers a little uneasy."

The film is rated 18+ for a reason. The plot is simple. A young attorney with a perfect record of 64-0 gets hired at a large New York law firm. He is overcome by the astonishing wealth of the new environment, where everything seems perfect.<br/><br/>Until he meets Milton (Pacino), he leads Lomax (Reeves) into a world of temptation.

","(Minor spoilers contained)<br/><br/>You may find this surprising but, as a Christian, I thought this movie was excellent. Extremely graphic in many places but boy did it make you think. Assuming Al Pacino's character John Milton was indeed the devil (this was heavily insinuated by the script and some of the characters clearly believed it, but Milton himself never admitted to it), the character was written in such a way as to line up with much of what the Bible says about him. He is wily, cunning, plays on the weaknesses of the humans he preys on rather than blatantly overpowering them. Seems harmless at first, seems even rather attractive - offering money, a good life, all sorts of promises. And interstingly enough, he keeps his promises - it's what he DOESN'T say that will trip you up every time. <br/><br/>If I was an extremely spiritually aware person, but not a Christian when I saw this, I think I would have been terrified out of my wits by the truth portrayed by this movie. Which is, the devil CAN get you. It is so easy for him to lull us into a false sense of security. And I too would have done what Reeves' character did at the end of the final conflict, IF I did not know Jesus. Seeing as I do, my reaction would have been different, and the movie would have been a COMPLETELY different plot if Reeves' character had been a Christian. If you'd like to know what might have happened, I highly recommend you check out the novels by Frank Peretti, 'This Present Darkness' and 'Piercing the Darkness'.<br/><br/>Devil's Advocate is a movie I would recommend to anyone who is a Christian! You'll learn a lot. Just be prepared for the nauseating graphic content of some of the scenes. I watched it with someone who had already seen it, she told me when the worst bits were, in advance!

Kevin realizes that no matter what happens, he is going to loose, and kills himself. Shortly after he awakes from his dream, standing in the bathroom, outside the court-room. He reconsiders his situation, and tells his client, that he wont represent him anymore. Outside the court-room, a reporter asks if he could get full rights to the story, promising Kevin wealth and fame.

","Nicely photographed and generally well acted. It's a pleasure to look at it on the screen. And there's some nifty dialog.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron is like chewing gum for the eyes, with her chubby cheeks and pretty, plump lips. You've just got to love ballerinas. And Connie Nielson is a treat too, although of a different kind. Not chewing gum exactly. Maybe a sourball. She has a distinctively sensual squint from which two surprisingly innocent eyes seem to glow. Nobody projects virginal depravity better than she.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is reliable in a loud and expansive role, waving his arms, ""Hoo""-ing his way through the movie, eyes abulge. Keanu Reeves looks handsome as a Southern lawyer although he doesn't bring much to the part. He can shout as well as Pacino but it's like watching an animatronic figure in Disneyland's Hall of Presidents shout. The effort shows through the performance and it's not really very convincing. Also, saints preserve us, how naive can a lawyer be? But even if everything else were perfect, the movie would still be confused about exactly what it's trying to be. A story of corruption at high-income levels, like ""The Firm"" or ""Wall Street""? A courtroom drama? The dramatic story of a devoted wife's breakdown? A supernatural thriller grappling with Big Questions? In the end it turns out to be a kind of ragout with the ingredients dominating in the order they're listed above. The climax is entirely and fantastically supernatural.<br/><br/>And what theology it is! Catechism is more complicated. This theology is really very simple. There's a real, genuine Christian God (who is of no help whatever, except that he's given us ""free will""). There is a good old-fashioned devil whose sole aim seems to be to noodge God and tick Him or Her off like a pebble in a shoe. The devil organized this gigantic and successful law firm because he wants to acquit everyone. (If he weren't a fallen angel he'd be all for burning at the stake.) There's a heaven, just as we've been told, and it seems like a Christian heaven. And there's a hell too. And judging from the last scene, involving a naked Nielson and orgiastic figures in a huge bas relief, the chiefest of sins is sex. It almost seems that the religious theme is built around Reeves' fundamentalist faith.<br/><br/>And, boy, is there punishment. At the end, just as he's about to do Connie Nielson, Reeves decides to shoot himself instead. Now, this strikes me as a major error in judgment, but let it go. As Reeves' dead body topples towards the floor, Pacino, the devil in the case, begins screaming, ""NOOO! NOOO!"" Connie Nielsen drops dead and rots on screen. Pacino somehow loses his clothes and then is burned alive -- or dead -- whatever. Everyone is shrieking and the screen is filled with special effects. It isn't explained how this particular earthly enterprise of the devil's can be destroyed by the suicide of one dumb guy.<br/><br/>It's pleasant to look at it, yes, but I'd have settled for that courtroom drama instead of this confused and confusing mishmash."

I guess it depends mostly on what mood i'm in.<br/><br/>This movie actually starts out pretty good in my opinion. This is definitely one of Keanu Reeves least embarrassing performances, at least the first hour or so of the movie. He's still stiff as a wooden board and about as exciting, but it fits his character. He's the hillbilly hotshot lawyer from a back water in Florida who has never lost a case. And now he gets the chance to go to New York and play with the big boys. And the biggest boy of them all is an adrenaline-pumped Al Pacino. It seems that every other movie or so Al Pacino goes off (or on?) his medication and suddenly turns into a freak show all of his own. Watch ""Scent of a woman"" for another example of this. Here he is over the top most of the time. Barely just pausing to catch his breath.<br/><br/>The movies main topics are sex, expensive wallpaper and Satan. And of course Keanu showing off what a damn fine lawyer he is. And before the end the whole story crashes like a train wreck of epic proportions. And the mad driver on the crashing train is an Al Pacino on speed.<br/><br/>This movie certainly has some entertainment value. And the first half it also has some potential. But the decline from the first to the second half is almost unprecedented. All quality, sense of cohesion and plot just disappears into a black hole. And the rating? Well a 4/10 maybe?"

","THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (1997) ***<br/><br/>Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron, Craig T. Nelson, Connie Nielsen, and Jeffrey Jones Director: Taylor Hackford  144 minutes  1997  Rated R<br/><br/>By Blake French: <br/><br/>	""The Devil's Advocate"" is like an HBO Friday night guilty pleasure movie. It gets so many things right on the money, from suspense to gore to how the devil really does work. Most of the time movies exaggerate monsters and myths, legends and killings. But Taylor Hackford gets his information correct: Satan is not a red colored monster with horns and a spiky tail, but a deceptive, conniving, individual in disguise and lives everywhere. Thus, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is so smart it's scary. <br/><br/>	The story is something to see. It is so wonderful and evenly laid out. It stars Keanu Reeves as Kevin Lomax, a young successful defense lawyer who, with his wife Mary Ann (a flawless and emotionally charged Charlize Theron), has recently moved to New York in order to hit it big with his occupation.<br/><br/>
And that is exactly what happens. He soon stumbles upon a powerful man named John Milton in charge of the cities biggest and best defense attorneys. He offers Kevin a deal, a beautiful office, a competitive wage, and bang, he his in goodbut he doesn't know yet how good he actually is in yet.<br/><br/>Then things begin to happen. Bad things. Horrible things. Mostly to Mary Ann, Kevin's wife who has meet a friend, Christabella, who isn't quite who she seems to be. Then come the experiences: She hears someone in the house while alone at night that turns out to be a small child who isn't quite as innocent as she seems. Then the visions of people being brutally killed appear in her mind. Then the loneliness, such a big, cold apartment with no husband to share it with, for he is always at work.  Such things may or may not lead to other events that trigger an involving series of happenings which make this subplot almost more interesting that the real story itself.<br/><br/>
Then come the criminals who the wondering Kevin witness as they walk away from a case that surly points to their guilt. And then the temptations that he is lured with every day at work. It is when his wife doesn't something drastic when he questions just exactly is his new boss, and where exactly did he come from.<br/><br/>The film is very interesting from beginning to end, and is certainly different than your typical horror/slasher movie. This one doesn't overdue the gore, but puts in more than enough to turn a head. The violence is harsh and cruel, only proving what powers this character in control has. The sexual orientation is a bit over the top, and yes, this film is adult with every atom of it's being, but to put in such copious amount of nudity and sexual content is still a little much. But once again, is only present to make clear that the devil works with enticement and lust, rather than sucking his victims in with force.  <br/><br/>Al Pacino is delicious and devilishly on target as Satan himself; I personally could not think of someone better to cast. He is, however, a little aggressive. The film works because of the way it uses the devil as its protagonist.  But Pacino seems to push the evil and demonic qualities, like his voice at times, and kind of destroys the concept of why this movie succeeds. Don't get me wrong, his performance is near perfect, but a little off the film's accomplishment.  <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is well casted also. He performs confidentially like a real lawyer would, and seems to be knowledgeable in his territory. I also found Charlize Theron's performance to be superb. And going from this to ""Might Joe Young"" is an awful big change in pace. But this performance not only proves that she can conquer characters in horror thrillers better than family adventures, but also that she can perform with depth and depression, with feeling and emotional impact. I find her Oscar capable.<br/><br/>
There is one major problem in ""The Devil's Advocate"" that struck me as a shock. The film runs well over two hours and gets pretty tedious at times. But the flaw comes with the film's finale: the movie builds up so much for a powerful confrontation between Lomax and Hilton a.k.a. Satan at the end, that it somehow actually finishes in an ending that lasts but ten minutes, and only succeeds to prove it's overall message: you can't mess with a man's free will. There Is character tension, but it is used with dialogue instead of physical contact, and only the last fragment accomplishes anything that it should. This closing is mostly a disappointment. But that's permissible because I am not recommending ""The Devil's Advocate"" for the closing scenes, but for the acting, the cleverness of the story, and the use of Satan as its villain, in an altogether adequate movie on Taylor Hackford's credits."
"mcesarini","3","3","7","4 January 2016"," Atrociously entertaining
","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the vibe and mediocrity of this movie. Keanu Reeves is absolutely awful and as much as I hate to say this, Al Pacino is awful, as well. The epitome of the term ""Over-acting"" is examplified by Pacino in this movie. Pacino tries too hard to be a villain with his cliché forced evil laugh and lets be honest, what relevance does him sticking his finger in the holy water and having it boil even play to the plot or scene? Its completely just tacking on irrelevant and unnecessary bad scenes. Keanu Reeves does a poor job faking his Southern accent and does even worse at showing any emotion as a character. This movie never makes you care about any character other than Theron's. Jeffrey Jones proved why he doesn't belong in dramas because I still only picture him as Rooney from Ferris Bueller. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 and not a 1 is because as bad as it is, it was entertaining. Its almost as if it was so bad that it was somewhat good. I wanted to see what happened in the end even though I was practically laughing at the stupidity of some scenes. Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment and a skid mark on a great career for Al Pacino."

","Florida defense lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) has a perfect record. He is angered when he realizes his client is guilty. Nevertheless, he destroys the victim on the stand. He is married to Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) and his religious mother Alice disapproves. John Milton (Al Pacino) recruits Kevin to his NYC law firm. The couple is given a massive apartment and lots of money.<br/><br/>Al Pacino seems to be having a lot of fun with lines like ""They don't see me coming."" He's great at being Satan. The movie is too ambitious. It wants to be a horror like 'The Exocist' or 'Rosemary's Baby', but it doesn't have the tension. It tries to be a character study but Kevin is too arrogant and too dumb to be appealing. It's also too long. This should be better especially with Pacino enjoying himself. The final twist is also problematic and is a cheat on the rest of the movie."
"secondtake","5","3","7","22 November 2014"," Overrated, over slick, laughable acting--it rubbed me the wrong way
","Devil's Advocate (1997)<br/><br/>A highly regarded movie in some circles, and I think because of the idea and the intensity of what's implied (implied more than made palpable). Yes, in real life, this would go places. But it's a fairly routine flick with one of Hollywood's least interesting actors in the main role. I'm talking Keanu Reeves, of course. There is the idea of the devil incarnate, which is the big hook of the movie, but this is almost a comic book version, exaggerated and campy.<br/><br/>Okay, yeah, there's the familiar thrill of a couple trying to move into high society and finding it filled with evil, carnal and monetary and otherwise. And there's the idea of a lawyer defending a man who is obviously bad, but the job overrides morality. All is well done enough on some level, but what an exaggerated hooha about nothing! This movie makes a mountain out of some very old ideas.<br/><br/>Al Pacino? Overacting and painful to watch at times, he's still a reasonable Hollywood devil. Reeves, the pretty boy who can't act? He really can't! More proof. People have commented that this is his greatest film, or that here at least we see him at his best! Hmph. He's reasonable, but imagine a better actor overwhelmed with ambition success and losing his loving wife and his sanity all at once. Now that's a lot of material for an actor to make hay from.<br/><br/>So what do we make of the plot, a crystallization of evil? Well, the devil is, of course, a bad fellow. He has infinite power it seems, but uses it judiciously. That makes no real sense, but you have to go with it. Supernatual effects will show up here in all kinds of bizarre and sensationalist places. If that's your thing, and you're a sexist man (there are lots of women who are purely eye candy), go for it. Sorry dudes, it's true. Swallow hard. Not my thing.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot is over the top. (John Grisham wrote it, remember.) It's about excess and flashy twists. The Anti-Christ? Sure, go there, for kicks. Vanity? Come on, is that what this was finally all about? Didn't we know that in the first few minutes?<br/><br/>Is this an unredeemed mess? Not quite, I suppose. The movie as a whole ends up being a solid supernatural lawyer film, and the script is straight forward narrative stuff —to the point that it seems banal, except you see the screen shifting its shape as you watch."
"ztanlines","5","3","7","6 August 2005"," Behold! I send you out as sheep amongst the wolves!
","Ultimately it will be up to you which wins out in this film: Al Pacino's attempt to elevate it or Keanu Reeves' attempt to sink it. Pacino does a splendid job as Satan himself and is aided by the best writing in the movie. We are treated to Satan's own views on good and evil and it is fascinating. Reeves appears to be - as he did in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" - foregoing all of the complexities in acting and portraying a single feeling at a time. Angry Keanu! Sad Keanu! Confuuuused Keanu! It's frustrating to see Al Pacino attempting to play off of him and being forced to carry the scenes by himself.<br/><br/>The overall writing is fairly standard with moments of brilliance. The supporting acting is pretty good, especially Charlize Theron. The cinematography and special effects work quite well.<br/><br/>This is a good one to catch on HBO and even rent if you like Pacino."

","I heard the title and was like, ""Wow! Sounds amazing!"" After all who doesn't enjoy those fascinating court scenes and the battle of wits among the men in black. The addition of a supernatural element of ""Satan"" or ""Lucifer"" or best known as ""the Devil"" only highlights the beauty of this flick. It seduces you, thrills you and deviously makes you beg for more and at just the point you believe its all over, surprises you with the possibility of a new future. It was so amazingly directed with some fabulous work by the cast, offering everything one desires of a film. A highly satisfying film which can get creepy at parts but mostly you'd be amazed at how beautifully the characters are presented and how effectively they did their job. What makes it most satisfying is how it becomes complicated and rewarding as it goes along. It questions the priority between Love and Ambition. The addiction in winning, the seduction in love, the thrill in deviousness and finally the humanity in confession and morality in retreat come together to make a blazing red brew... ""The Devil's Advocate""."

","I love this film.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' customary impassiveness is ideally suited to playing an ambitious lawyer with a murky personal history, lured into a fast track to the big time by Al Pacino's law firm boss who, we rapidly realise, is the devil himself (as if the film's title and the character's name of John Milton didn't give us enough clues).<br/><br/>This combination of supernatural thriller and personal drama leads us - and Keanu - up the garden path and down again a number of times until, finally, the long awaited showdown occurs. The movie then resolves in a number of different ways, all of which are completely satisfying.<br/><br/>Everything is good in this film, but pride of place must go to Pacino, playing Milton with a reptilian seductiveness which repels and attracts simultaneously. I can't imagine anyone else playing the part half as effectively."

","Never believable for a second, but was it supposed to be?<br/><br/>Devil's Advocate is a surreal folk story about a hotshot lawyer headhunted by a mysterious law firm. He's got a pretty perfect record, so on moving to New York he starts to become big business. Pacino is Milton, the boss of the new company, and as usual, he exudes charisma like it were going out of fashion. Clearly having a ball, he obviously enjoyed playing a character who always seems to be one step ahead. Reeves, Lomax, is the weak spot in this movie, with a role giving him the chance to prove he's more than a surfer dude with a penchant for 'whoa'. Unfortunately he struggles with his part, putting on a pretty hammy Texan accent which makes him look like he's contriving every word. Theron's his wife, Mary Anne, and puts on an understandably overacted show as a woman who can't cope with the strange goings-on around her.<br/><br/>The plot's daft, and the movie never takes itself seriously for a second. Consequently as hokum, it's pretty darn good."

","Devil's Advocate kept me awake. I mention this because it is so  unusual. I find that most of what people call ""horror"" on film to be  laughable. I did not laugh at Devil's Advocate. It was disturbing.  The subject of evil and terror is so well handled. This movie preys  upon your deep, primal fears. The shadow that has no source. The noise  with no explanation. The sense of evil that flickers at the edge of  your awareness, but is gone before you can identify it.  The Devil is not your typical ""horns and pitchfork"" caricature. Al Pacino portrays him masterfully as suave, witty, sophisticated, and  utterly evil. He plays with the minds of men for his amusement, and has  them killed without hesitation.  . But the movie is still well worth watching. Make no mistake, this  movie will have an impact.  Just be prepared to leave the lights on when you go to bed."

The only thing that was a tiny bit over the top for me was the last scene in Al's apartment/office with all the crazy flames and effects going on.

","This is one movie that brilliantly highlights the true consequences of loving yourself more than anyone else. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a prosecutor-turned-lawyer in this movie and he ignores his good conscience in order to win his cases and free actual perpetrators. He gets headhunted by an office in New York and simply put, things get freaky. His new boss seems to favour him more than everyone else despite him being the ""newbie"" in the firm and his wife suffers from nightmares and hallucinations. All the while, he keeps working and winning high profile cases that have been assigned to him by his boss. He has no soul anymore, and all he cares about is his winning streak and his career. Until a very unfortunate event forces him to re-evaluate his life.<br/><br/>This is one of Keanu's best performances, in my opinion. For most of the movie, he's the bad guy and he *sells* it. He's able to compartmentalize his emotions and when he's angry, it's shown with such vigour that you can't help but be angry on his behalf as well. Al Pacino who plays the devil boss is also right in his element. He's not outright evil but every action of his weighs heavily on whomever is on the receiving end. Al Pacino makes a really good villain honestly. Another standout performance is by Charlize Theron who plays Lomax's wife. She is the doting and supporting wife of a successful lawyer and she gradually withers away into a woman who has been tortured by the devil himself. Her fear and distress aren't real but a damn good actress like her makes it look real."

The film revolves around a hot-shot defense attorney who gets accepted into one of the most powerful law firms in New York. But his new job offering offering experiences that he would never dream of lies a deep dark sinister behind close curtains. This film is like if John Grisham's The Firm and Rosemary's Baby came together and had a child. What I enjoy about Devil's Advocate is that instead of making it your typical flavor-of-the-week courtroom drama, the team creates your typical courtroom drama, but adds an element of supernatural horror to the mix. The problem with Devil's Advocate is that it has a hard time whether it's a horror movie or a movie inspired by the works of John Grisham. The way I see it, the first half of the movie is your courtroom drama. Then the second half we start to see some horror thrown at us, and finally were thrown with the last remaining of horror that the film offers us. Also the middle half of the movie is also confused as it seems that the screenwriters were lost and confused on how to bring this movie full circle. Another thing i want to point out is that Devil's Advocate is filled with over the top performances by Keanu Reeves who tries to do a perfect southern accent, but fails and feels rushed as well. And Al Pacino, who delivers an over the top performance you could've swore that he wasn't acting and the director is just rolling because he's enjoying as well as we are. Its not Al Pacino's best, but it's certainly not his worst.

It is amazing to think that Al was 57 when he made this film because in all honesty he is still sexy but I suppose I'm biased because I think Al is the sexiest bloke alive!!  Probably the most excellent aspect of this film is the way it deals with superficiality. The way Keanu's character embraces the glamorous New York lifestyle and women over his wife who after the 'make over' is not a beautiful as she once was but inside she still is beautiful.  Instead he fantasises about the mysterious italian character who in truth is dead inside.  Al's character constantly gives Keanu's character the opportunity to get out but regardless Keanu is striving for power and wealth over the pursuit of a happy private life.

It has been done much better elsewhere however so for me it didn't really work.<br/><br/>Al Pacino came across as quite a plausible old Devil and managed to keep something of a grip despite otherwise mediocre performances from the support."

","""the Devil's Advocate"" was robbed of a 'Best Screenplay' nomination at the Oscars!<br/><br/>Although many would consider this film as a case of ""lawyer bashing"", it's inevitable that a screenwriter would choose the law profession to expose the human boundaries between right and wrong, justice and greed, spirituality and humanism.<br/><br/>We all know that defense lawyers deal with the fact that at times they truly believe that their clients are guilty, as well as prosecutors knowing that the defendant is innocent. It's all about self-mobility, which begets self-want.  That's where the Devil steps in.  For those that betray justice, honor, humility, and the ones they love; those people have truly become advocates of the Devil.<br/><br/>This film would make a great double feature with Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant""<br/><br/>And needless to say, nobody could play the Devil better than Pacino."

Although he's one of the greatest actors of all time, i just never stopped seeing him as Al Pacino, when i should have seen him as the devil. That's what you get when you cast a megastar in this kind of part. He smirks, smiles, an surely talks a lot. There are wisecracks, dialogues filled with philosophy and intelligence. There's nudity and beauty, and some degree of hard violence. But if this is THE devil, Satan himself, then he sure doesn't scare me.<br/><br/>The scenes where the girlfriend, played by Charlize Theron, gradually goes out of her mind are the most effective in the movie, including the scene where she ends her own psychological suffering. But for the rest, it's a great movie, with fantastic acting performances (even by Keanu Reeves), great dialogue, good special effects, a great climax, and a damn good score.

","Somebody once said that after Shakespeare, every drama is a Faustian tale of sorts.

And as they say, movies are script, casting, and the rest in that order. This is a very good script - great lines, well paced and some good twists which you can work out but what the heck, it's a good ride anyway. <br/><br/>Casting Keanu Reeves as the lawyer about to sell his soul - well, somebody was having a quiet chuckle somewhere, but Keanu gives it his best shot. Against Al Pacino who has been given a licence to go Completely Over the Top, well it must have been a daunting prospect, but Keanu pulls it off much better than you'd expect. <br/><br/>Pacino puts the whole thing into perspective and keeps the viewer happy with a humdinger performance as a campy but very plausible and convincing Lucifer. Charlize Theron is wonderful as Mary Anne. Everybody puts in and there is an interesting ending which I liked more than some other reviewers.<br/><br/>Pact-with-the-devil stories can be horrendous if they are taken too seriously, but Devil's Advocate just stays on the right side of pretentiousness.

`Guilt is like carrying a f**kin bag of bricks. Put it down.' - Al Pacino, as the devil.<br/><br/>
Spiritual and gothic thriller that amidst blinding performances still suffers from familiarity. The apparatus of the script is weak, so the viewer is constantly one step ahead of the main character of Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), and his dance with the devil. <br/><br/>
Charlize Theron is wonderfully headstrong and focused as Lomax's wife, while Connie Nielsen is sexy, sophisticated and breezy as the office vamp. Of course, the agenda in The Devil's Advocate is clearly Al Pacino. By getting him to play the devil, the moviemakers were halfway home already.<br/><br/>
Pacino was made for the role and he knows it. He's all over the place. With him, it's always a pleasure. He's cocky, provocative and dangerously seductive. The dialogue is chewable, and Pacino relishes in it, his eyes widening and his cheeky smiles going ear to ear. <br/><br/>
The moral reasoning is even reflective and The Devil's Advocate is also at times an entertaining subversive comedy, but this mix of Rosemary's Baby and The Firm sorely lacks any real sense of surprise."

Whereas, one might argue, there have already been plenty anti-christs, i.e. all his existing children (and if there were so many, why was Lomax character so important to him?). Just to point out one flaw in the ""logic"" of this movie.<br/><br/>The single most annoying moment was when the devil called himself a ""humanist"" thus playing to some Christian fundamentalists' equating humanism with satanism. He did have a point, though, as far as his criticism of God is concerned.<br/><br/>Apart from all that, I didn't like the fact that Pacino playing the devil was kind of implied by the title of the movie and by one-line summaries of the movie, but was not actually something the movie itself showed conclusively. After all Lomax's wife could have just had hallucinations when she saw people turn into demons. And the whole New York episode a dream.

","The Devil's Advocate has a number of things going for it.  Keanu Reeves does surprisingly well at not offending in his lead role here.  Al Pacino makes it almost easy to like his character.  Charlize Theron is absolutely stunning in her role, and milks the role of all its dramatic possibilities. The sets are beautiful, the movie is well-filmed, and the script is mostly intricate and involving.  The film mostly suffers from only a few minor problems, including some distractingly unnecessary nudity.  What, then, is this film's biggest problem?  Its ending!  A cheaper, more insulting, and outright unfair ending has not existed in a recent movie as far as I'm concerned.  The tension and drama in the film build, and it works on making its point, for over two hours, only to be completely derailed and ignored in the last five minutes.  As a result, I cannot recommend this film to anyone...  A movie that improves after a few poor opening minutes is still worthwhile, but a movie that has everything going for it, only to throw it away when it should have hit a home run, is without a doubt one of the seven deadly sins of filmmaking."

The nuances of expression and voice inflection he uses to create this attractive/repulsive diabolical character show clearly that he is at the top of his craft.  Keanu Reeves is also very good, and the majority of the performances seem to fit the bill nicely.<br/><br/>What makes the movie stand out is the focus on TEMPTATION rather than total evil.  John Milton (Pacino's character ....hmmmm...""Paradise Lost""...get it?) presents a series of temptations any of us might fall for, before recognizing the evil behind the promises.  The writing includes many intricately developed pokes at the standard ""Goodness of God, Evil of the Devil"" arguments we all know.<br/><br/>The only weakness in the film, that I could see, lies in its ending....or does it?

","'The Devil's Advocate' works as neither a supernatural thriller nor a courtroom drama  instead it relies heavily upon excessive content and performances, silly over-the-top concepts and a genuinely unpleasing conclusion, all of which stain an otherwise fairy enjoyable modern-day parable.<br/><br/>The movie rambles on far too long about nothing in particular, always thinking it's much cleverer than it actually is. For example, the identity of a mysterious tycoon in New York City, named John Milton (hint-hint), isn't revealed until about 2/3 of the way through the film  despite the fact that the title of the movie, and all the events therein leading up to this 'revelation,' basically give away the 'secret' from the start. So why in the world didn't anyone realize this during production? Did anyone stop and say, 'I wonder if people will be smart enough to guess who he really is before we expect them to?'<br/><br/>If you don't want to know who Milton is, don't read any further. However, if you have an IQ past that of the guy from Sling Blade, you'll probably already realize that John Milton (played by Al Pacino) is the Devil. Lucifer. Satan. 'I have so many names,' he says to hotshot lawyer Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>The story is routine at best  Milton hires the Aspiring Young Lawyer from Hicksville, U.S.A. to travel to the Big Apple and take on Important Cases. Soon the Lawyer's Wife (Charlize Theron) turns into the Crazy Character That No One Believes, because she thinks Milton is the devil, and they all laugh at her, and her husband laughs at her. Hmmmaybe everyone on set was consuming laughing gas  this would explain why the film rarely makes sense and Theron turns in the best performance in a film starringAl Pacino? It's almost sad to see him resorting to more yelling and screaming and over-the-top ranting  Pacino's big speech about God has potential, but he says it all so annoyingly that it begins to grate on the nerves. I don't expect Pacino to play Satan as a calm everyman, but at least he could try and make a consistent character out of the role  instead of showing up on set, consuming laughing gas and acting like an idiot. (Forgive me, because I actually am an enormous fan of Pacino's work  but he simply stinks here, and there's no excuse for his poor performance.)<br/><br/>'The Devil's Advocate' bears most relation to the supernatural film-noir hybrid, 'Angel Heart,' released a decade prior. That film co-starred Robert De Niro, who handled the role of Satan much better than Pacino  mainly because although they both acted rather flamboyantly, De Niro had better control. Ever since 'Scent of a Woman' in 1992, Pacino's over-acting has increased to a point of near-nausea  is this the same guy who so expertly played Michael Corleone and Tony Montana? ""The Panic in Needle Park"" had better acting -- and that was his first major movie!<br/><br/>If you can put up with a movie that is over-the-top and excessive and puts the work of Brian DePalma to shame, then maybe you'll be able to stand'The Devil's Advocate.' If you can put up with a movie that wastes the talents of its main performers and leads nowhere but into an unsatisfying apocalyptic massacre of an ending, you might even enjoy this.<br/><br/>But if you can put up with a movie that proposes Keanu Reeves is a genius lawyer who's 'never lost a single case,' you deserve to die a very painful death. Please go far away and never return.<br/><br/>Just kidding. But seriously  Keanu Reeves? Tom Green has a better chance"

He joins the firm and begins to amass success, meanwhile however his wife is slowly losing her grip on reality and his boss, John Milton, appears to have every excess known to man as part of his lifestyle.<br/><br/>I'm sure it is meant to be a twist and I should write `spoiler' on my subject line, but if anyone doesn't know that the head of the law firm is Satan then I'm sorry for spoiling it for you here.  The title may have given you a clue and the name `Milton' might have been a little hint, but apologies!  It is no surprise that he is the devil as this is the point of the film.  The plot is a little OTT but enjoyably so, playing up excesses in all areas and making gleeful swipes at the material rich of the Western world (I assume the director lives in a modest house in a rough area?).  The film still carries an air of legal thriller to it that is good and it is only really let down by an overly twisty end and an overlong epilogue.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so very well is the performances.  The cast is deep in well known faces, but it is Pacino's film all the way.  His flamboyant overacting is perfect here and he is totally engrossing all the way  peaking in his final rant at God, the `absentee landlord', the `sadist'. The film wisely never goes too long without him as he is the key  the subplots involving Marie-Anne are still good but not as enjoyable as the title character.  Reeves is good but never totally convinced me that he was as brilliant a legal mind as the script suggests.  Theron is good and undergoes a believable transformation during the film.  Support is good from Jones, Lindo, and Ivey but it is never anyone else's film but Pacino, who revels in the chance to overplay and ham it up.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a great film  it is too obvious (think Angel Heart) and is OTT in all aspects of delivery.

All those lines about God were great -even though I´m a Catholic believer- because they displayed in a very sincere manner the essence of humanism and the skepticism of many people in the world who feed their atheism off those exact premises.<br/><br/>I loved it when Pacino replies with the contemporaneous ""whatever"". The disdain he shows at this moment for Reeves´ own interpretation of what´s happening can only be called ""art in less than a sentence"".<br/><br/>Finally, I agree with Pacino´s character when he advises Lomax ""to stay in the trenches"", never exhibiting all his capabilities and knowledge without needing it so. I think that´s a very underrated piece of advise for many of us in this ""smarter-than-thou"" world. ""Learn the subway Kevin!"" Pacino yells. Let´s learn it all of us.

Ooooh, how deep!<br/><br/>There's already enough comments from others on the unnecessary and gratuitous nudity, so I can't add to what's already been stated perfectly. If your idea of a good time at the movies is to turn your brain off and just be ""entertained"" (as if you can't be entertained by a smart film!), then by all means check out this dopey flic."

","A very good lawyer and his wife move to New York for a very well paid contract provided by a mysterious guy's firm. There, he's provided with everything he and his wife could desire but things are not going to be as great as they expected. The old proverb is true: money doesn't bring happiness, so he becomes much too busy and determined to further prove himself with his career (in which he builds truly brilliant cases of defending the guilty ones) that he has way too little time for his wife, who slowly seems to lose her mind. His boss on the other hand, has quite a questionable past and will ultimately prove to be a character beyond everyone's imagination.<br/><br/>It's a movie full of suspense, tension and unexpected events which keep you attracted and eager to find how such a complicated and complex situation can end. Speaking of the finale, it is simply great, unpredictable and very satisfying. Keanu plays a good role but Al Pacino truly shines, his performance managing to create a truly awesome character. I cannot express in words what great sensation this movie left me so I will simply recommend it with all my heart! Be aware though, it has some creepy moments, quite unsuitable for the faint hearted."

","Why this movie was never widely appreciated is quite a mystery to me. Must be just ahead of its time. It never got on my radar I had a chance to see it on a rare slow evening ....and it is a stunning, rare experience. If you have not seen it --ignore all the negative reviews--just get ready for a fantastic ride. It is not what you expect but no short-cut in story telling is taken. It is a thinking man's thriller, with an exceptional cast. This movie would not be same without Keanu, Theron, and Pacino. The acting is first-rate and they sell you the story the old-fashioned way. A thrilling ride that pick's up pace and reaches a logical but slightly drawn out conclusion....It is a long movie but it allows for complex theme of evil and how it manipulates the gullible is developed .,...but gullible (s) are not just plain and passive people---they have a complex psyche and their own strengths and reasons. All comes together spectacularly.<br/><br/>The movie is also great visually but it never overwhelms you with dominating special effects. I hope some day the smart folks in Hollywood realize (or develops more faith)--- that the biggest special effect of all is the face, tone, and mannerism of an actor..yes it is called ACTING...so mesmerizing that it make you forget the celluloid screen and you believe and get invested in the character completely. This is why Casablanca can still give you a bittersweet feeling even more than five decades later and any product from (Master) Ingmar Bergman makes thinking during the movie easy and so pleasurable."

","""Can you imagine a world without lawyers?"" The mere thought of happy people from all over the world dancing hand-in-hand in circle around a beautiful rainbow sent an immediate shiver down Lionel Hutz' spine. This classic moment from ""The Simpsons"" pretty much sums up the connection people make between lawyers and evil. How can there be anyone making loads of money from a job that basically consists on raising doubt over the guilt of child molesters or war criminals? Of course, lawyers are the reincarnations of the devil! There's an ethical bunch that defends the widow and the orphan but Taylor Hackford makes no secret that his devil's advocate is no Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>And Kevin Lomax, played by an underrated Keanu Reeves, is a hot-shot with as much ethics as Lionel Hutz. A young girl is just testifying against her teacher, Lomax sees his own client caressing his crotch, there's no doubt in his mind that the man is filth, his conscience is shaken so he asks to go to the bathroom, but when he comes back, you understand that it was just a moment of weakness, not realization. He knows exactly how to handle the situation and through a habile cross-examination, he gets the pedophile acquitted. Yet, we never really deem Lomax as a bad man, there's something about this young go-getter that doesn't fuse villainous vibes or the conviction that his cockiness will backfire at him, and that's integral to the film's appreciation. If we believed at the spot that he was the bad guy, the Faustian pact wouldn't have any dramatic weight.<br/><br/>The film set him up as a Florida prodigy who never lost a case, his secret is a sixth sense that allows him to pick the right jury for the job, which is impressive enough to raise itself beyond 'evil' stereotyping. As for his background, he's a man who grew up without any father-figure (which excuses his cynicism), raised by a mother (Judith Ivey) whose devotion to religion feels more like overcompensation than bigotry, and married to a lively and beautiful girlfriend remarkably played by Charlize Theron. His last victory earns him a contract in a prestigious lawyer's cabinet in New York, he demonstrates his jury-picking skills and manages to win an unsolvable case, and in the process a high firm position in the cabinet. The film tells the wags-to-riches story with such gusto and an amazing attention to details highlighting wealth and power than we kind of enjoy it without really waiting for any supernatural elements. As a matter of fact, the title is a bit of a give-away.<br/><br/>Indeed, is it spoiling the film to say that Al Pacino is the Devil? A simple look at the poster and a game of elimination will get you to the conclusion. And when John Milton, the CEO, makes his entrance, shakes hands with Lomax and takes him to the top of the building, where a sort of pool has been designed so that it looks like the edge of Niagara falls, we get an eloquent metaphor for Lomax' situation, like walking on a tightrope, with a man who can either take him to the summit or cause his downfall. Hackford's film is visually eloquent and creates such intriguing build-ups that the early jump scares are efficient. But as powerful as they are, a few of them aren't anticipated, and the film ventures in a territory we identify as familiar since we know the title and the main theme. It's not like Alan Parker's ""Angel Heart"" which starts like a film-noir before descending into horror.<br/><br/>But there's a certain delight within the anticipation of the thrills to come and to see poor Lomax' always only one step behind his wife until it hits him in the face. The escalation toward more and more disturbing revelations culminates with one of these moments where you realize that none other than Al Pacino can make the devil look so flashy and entertaining. De Niro was a creepy devil, but Pacino's angle is perfect for the film, he's a man who goes over the top, histrionic since that's a skill required for his job. That's the trick lawyers use and the essence of the devil, it doesn't guide you much as it whispers in your head all you need to make the wrong moves by yourself, it's all in pretending, in masking emotions and guiding the others through the desired reactions. It's all about spotting the Achille's heel and in Lomax' case, by his own admission, his ego is his biggest weakness, Vanity is his sin and for a puppeteer like Milton, it's the easiest string to pull.<br/><br/>This revelation, while not a twist, reveals why we gave him the benefit of the doubt by pinpointing his real sin, through a flamboyant and operatic showdown between Lomax and Pacino who got (of course) the best lines and a few fiery tirades, to which Reeves reacts perfectly as the straight-man. While not reinventing the codes or providing anything in the same vein than ""Rosemary's baby"" or ""The Exorcist"", ""The Devil's Advocate"" is less interested in providing horror thrills than revealing the depths of human propensity to endorse horror, and all in flash, a few substance, and some jump scares worthy of the best thriller."
"zkonedog","7","1","2","8 March 2017"," Somewhat A Mess, But Oh So Intriguing
","""The Devil's Advocate"" is a strange motion picture. In some ways, it is a complete and utter mess. Yet, it touches on such interesting themes and contains such great acting that it is tough to rank it as anywhere near ""bad"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Devil's Advocate"" sees hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) move from his small southern practice to the ""big time"" in New York with wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Employed by the mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino), Kevin begins to realize that his ""dream job"" may be a bit more complicated (and ultimately cosmic) than he could have possibly imagined.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, this film is top-notch through and through. Al Pacino was born to play the nefarious Milton, Reeves gives a solid performance as the conflicted lawyer, and Theron is startling as the mentally-slipping (or is she?) wife. For fans specifically of Pacino watching this film to see one of his ""rants"", you will not be disappointed, either.<br/><br/>The conflicting part of the movie, however, lies in its multitude of themes. Such topics as ""God vs. Devil"", ""Innocence vs. Guilt"", ""Small-Town vs. Big City"", ""Ethics vs. Greed"", and ""Husband vs. Wife"" are touched upon. Each theme in and of itself is extremely interesting and could carry the film without the others, but the problem is that they all smooshed together for two and a half hours. Just when you think the movie is about one thing...BAM, it switches to something else. While that filmmaking is admirable in terms of keeping the viewers glued to the screen, director Taylor Hackford could have done a much better job of sorting things out to produce a clean, crisp narrative, instead of one that jumps so often from theme to theme.<br/><br/>Overall, this was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. The acting and plot elements are incredible, but it just tries to do too much and gets lost within itself at times. It could have been epic, but instead (because of those flaws) settles for ""above average"". If you are a Pacino or Reeves fan, or just like movies that will make you think, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is very much worth a viewing. It may not fit together perfectly, but you'll be thinking about it long after the TV is turned off."
"pmakauloski2312","7","1","2","25 July 2015"," Pretty Good...
","This movie was certainly interesting. Can't say I've seen anything like it. It will make you think and it has a few moments that are a little frightening. I really didn't have any expectations for this film other than knowing that Pacino and Keanu Reeves were in it and It had an intriguing title. The plot is basically a lawyer, Kevin Lomax (Reeves) who moves to NYC and starts working cases for a new boss, John Milton (Pacino). You can tell early on that there is something different about his boss, he acts very corrupt. Later we find out that he is the devil. Reeves is working on a case where he has to defend a child molester and bad things start happening. His wife, Mary Ann who was played by Charlize Theron, starts to lose her grip on reality. She starts seeing things that aren't there. Towards the end of the movie, she kills herself in a mental institution. Theron was probably the best actor in this movie, i thought that Pacino and Reeves were just okay, I didn't come away thinking that they excelled in their roles. The movie has a few twists and turns that i didn't expect. Late in the film, we find out that most of the movie was a bad dream showing Reeves what would happen if he followed through in defending the molester. So, the ending is Reeves deciding to not defend his client and instead go with his conscious. The only issue is that the media is all over him for making such a decision. Pacino goes on to say that vanity is his favorite sin.<br/><br/>7.5/10 The score in this was fantastic, it gives off a very eerie vibe. The acting was just okay for the most part and the story was crazy. It all makes sense in the end but for a while it just seems to be chaos. Overall, it's a solid film that is complicated to understand the first viewing. I like the idea in this film, it could have been even better. Not really a classic in my opinion."
"nanakwarteng","9","1","2","21 July 2015"," A Masterpiece of a Script
","Very few times does Hollywood get it right when portraying characters that truly tell the nature of the human experience. The Devil's Advocate does so in spectacular fashion. Kevin Lomax, brilliantly played by Keanu Reeves, is a charismatic lawyer in the state of Florida whose undefeated career is propelled into the limelight when he wins one more seemingly unwinnable case. Invited to New York to help in a jury selection by a powerful firm headed by the equally charismatic John Milton, played by the ever excellent Al Pacino, Kevin's astuteness is rewarded when he is offered a job at the law firm. But he is soon to learn that all is not as it seems when he settles with his wife in the modern-day ""Babylon"" that it is New York. This movie is packed with A-listers: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron etc,--a separate, dedicated article is needed just to expound on the depth of their performances. The truly great thing though about the movie is the script. Because an actor is only as good as what he/she has to work with. And in The Devil's Advocate the actors had something that only comes around once in a lifetime. It is a complex examination of the concept of free-will and how sometimes as humans we forget that we ALWAYS have a choice, and that the choices we make shape our life and the lives of those around us. But sometimes in our pursuit of perfection we lose that moral anchor that delineates clearly for us what is good and what is bad. And we lose that anchor because there is a powerful force working hard for us to. Free Will? Conundrum, right? The ""Devil"" in the title, John Milton, accuses God of playing a sort of game with us by giving us free will and then admonishing us to not ""Touch This"" and ""Don't Touch That"", supposedly driving us crazy with rules He knows we can't keep. However rules does not remove choice, otherwise there will no be criminal justice system. The rules are there, and we chose whether to break it or not. FREE WILL. It's a blessing a curse. For how can we run when a more powerful force seduces our will one way or another? That's the dilemma of the human experience and the question this movie poses."

","Even a massive film fan like me can't see every movie as it is released at the cinema or on DVD and sometimes it is fun to watch a work years after its release and see what has happened to its stars in the intervening period. So almost two decades passed before I caught up with ""Devil's Advocate"" (1997), a film with plenty of sex and violence that is a savage critique of the American legal profession and a challenge to the Christian conception of the Almighty.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays the diabolical head of a sprawling corporate empire who gives a splendidly over-the-top performance. Of course, Pacino - one of the finest actors of his generation - was a star at the time and continues to shine in his 70s and any compilation of his greatest moments should include a clip from his diatribe at the end of ""Devil's Advocate"". Keanu Reeves is the advocate of the title, a hot-shot young lawyer who somehow never loses a case. This role came before Reeves hit the big time with ""The Matrix"" trilogy and, since then, his career has fluctuated but is currently on an up with his appearance as ""John Wick"". <br/><br/>The real surprise is Charlize Theron who plays the advocate's wife. She was virtually unknown when appeared in this movie - one of her very first - but is now a high- profile celebrity with a central role in the blockbuster ""Max Max: Fury Road"". She might now regret her full-frontal nude scene in ""Devil's Advocate"" but she not the only woman on show here and the shot does have a dramatic purpose."

","Supernatural forces hover over the courtroom in this devilish drama adapted from the novel by Andrew Neiderman.

Instead, he leaves Gainesville, Florida, with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to put his legalistic skills to the test at a leading Manhattan law firm run by John Milton (Al Pacino). It all goes smoothly -- with Milton urging them to stay, putting Kevin on a $400-per-hour salary, and moving the couple into a luxurious apartment in his own building on Fifth Avenue -- where Mary Ann falls under the influence of neighbor Jackie (Tamara Tunie).

But the great point of this movie is the outstanding performance of Al Pacino, the most amazing Devil I've ever seen in the Movies. The story may be offensive for fanatic religious, once the religious focus is on the Devil's vision about the facts. However, it must be seen as a critic about the way we live, committing sins and expecting the heaven. About the special effects it's important to consider that the movie is from 1997 and Hackford took full advantage of the technology he had.

","I must say this is my favorite Pacino movie. He OWNS it.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's sheer magnetism and almost super-natural innate charm, his imposing presence have never been so well used as in ""Devil's Advocate"". Clearly, he was born to play John Milton. Funny, seductive, menacing, Pacino steals the show from Keanu Reeves and everyone else, as expected.<br/><br/>There is a tension, a creepy vibe throughout the movie, thanks to a stylish and clever direction. There's a brief scene, of 2 minutes or so, when 6 characters are traveling together in an elevator. In these 2 minutes, every single character has something very interesting to do, and it's fascinating to watch those energies cross fire. <br/><br/>There's another scene where Al Pacino has a conversation with Charlize Theron about her haircut. That brief seduction scene is supreme because it's so well written and acted it turns into magic. <br/><br/>The script also has a sense of humor which is much appreciated. I never get tired of watching this movie, it's too entertaining."
"luminous-luciano","6","1","2","20 January 2012"," Rest this case...
","One had to expect only the most memorable results from an association between Taurus Films and Warner Bros. - and as much as I disagree with many elements of the end product, 1997's The Devil's Advocate certainly is that; memorable...<br/><br/>I lament the fact, though, that, just like quite a few other similar offerings out there, it offered only the most violent and repulsive resolution as possible means of triumph over evil. I guess that they catered to the most obvious common denominator in doing so, and since almost everyone out there would take the easy way out if they were faced with the Adversary himself, they thought that it was the way ""to go"" - literally... Almost everyone out there is self-loathing to the extreme, so double the reason right there to go this route, I suppose? Tinseltown thinks these things through, you know! And it certainly the way they are in that town - is it not?<br/><br/>Neiderman's novel, which served as the basis for this one, was itself inspired by various other opuses, it is evident, as the movie itself is reminiscent of previous fare in this very same genre as well... Disappointing, as is the choice of first name for the actual advocate here...! But that is another matter, a trifle less important as it is not universal...<br/><br/>The devil's DAUGHTER here, though, is a true and true temptress... No disappointment there! The character delivered on all fronts, as did the actress chosen for that, one must admit, key part.<br/><br/>Not one but TWO suicides mar ""The Devil's Advocate"" and its lesson about VANITY - first, the poor MaryAnn, portrayed magnificently by Charlize Theron (between this and being ""The Astronaut's Wife"", she really doesn't know how to pick'em! May have been why she turned into a Monster afterwards...?) And then the title character himself (it still feels awful to call any lead character ""Kevin"" - let's say Keanu instead! Darn - that sounds odd too... Not as much though! At least, this isn't a Bill & Ted feature... *Whew*!) <br/><br/>The real problem is entirely another, however: for it is not quite acceptable to wipe everything off at the end either, to still have the mandatory ""happy ending"" - complete with EVIL STILL LURKS AND IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT DEFEATED AT ALL after-taste. This, after TWO GRUESOME SUICIDE SCENES? At least, ""Fallen"" was not so hypocritical and stuck with its ""very unhappy ending"" - for pure logic's sake! Both films err in the same manner though - to pretend that the only way to elude an opponent such as the ultimate Adversary is through auto-destruction and nothing else is simply the WRONG MESSAGE TO SEND... Is there truly no other way to battle the devil in Tinseltown? In real life there are plenty: crucifixes, holy water, prayer! Alas, none of these are regular props in these flicks... not anymore! The days of The Exorcist and Hammer Films are long gone - crucifixes used to be worth something, back then!<br/><br/>Hollywood has to be more careful with this sort of thing, one figures, for they seem not to want to spread such things as ""piousness"" and ""faith"" nowadays...! We dare not offend nor alienate all the other beliefs, these days...! As it is already the case, only the sun will destroy vampires for instance - lest we make them vulnerable to ALL symbols of ALL religions, we make them invulnerable to all and do not even broach the subject anymore! Alas, the first bloodsucker, Dracula and everyone of the same ilk that has followed were NOT vulnerable to the sunlight but were vulnerable to other things... Guess what it was now! This is not the biggest problem here, again: the end solution is.<br/><br/>No heroes should simply escape the conflict by blowing themselves up... Prototypical action heroes do not do it - why should anyone who has to deal with the devil itself resort to this ultimate tactic?<br/><br/>I know that I lauded Al Pacino's performance in Carlito's Way and in many other films - but, here, I shall remain silent about his histrionics as ""the devil""... He seemed to enjoy it; that is for sure.<br/><br/>It is amusing though to note that both ""Fallen"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"" (as also ""Interview With A Vampire"", of course) had a Rolling Stones song playing as they finally rolled the end credits... Sexagenarian, sex-obsessed rock'n'rollers who are STILL going strong; they must have indeed struck a deal with the devil (but they're not vampires - no) - hence the music fits on more than one level here! Again, the after-taste is just a tad bitter to swallow..."

","This movie is about a talented lawyer that knows exactly what to do to win cases. But his ambitions get the better of him and things start to get weird. This film isn't as impressive as I was expecting it to be, but it's still a pretty darn good movie. With everything interwoven in a really good manner. I never really thought of Keanu Reeves as a phenomenal actor but he is alright in this movie and fit decently. He played the manipulative lawyer and intelligent lawyer really well. Although Keanu Reeves takes up most of the screen time, the real scene stealer is Al Pacino. In fact Al Pacino is what makes this movie engaging, sort of. Even if Al Pacino first refused this role because he wanted to get paid more and the cool actor Keanu took some money out from his own account in order to get Al Pacino into this film. Now lawyers are known to some as liar and this is the premise of the movie with lies and greed. And this all adds up to evil and the consequences of this and the message is basically about how there is aspects of the devil in all of us. Well mostly temptation for most people. But we all have choices, in fact life is about choices and we are accountable for our decisions. Now I found this movie to be a bit mediocre but as the film comes close to the end, it really does pick up. Although that ain't saying much since majority of this is mediocre, but the as the film comes close to the end it really started to become intriguing. Now I can see why some people would think the final speech Al Pacino's character gives in the movie to be magnificent, but it's old and it's a philosophy that has been done before. But on the other hand there is charisma the way Al Pacino's character delivers it, and many bad men in the past had charisma. And the main reason I found why some people would root for Al Pacino's character is the aspect of his speech when he claims ""I'm﻿ a fan of man---I'm a humanist"". Even if it's stupid for people to claim to have become a satanist because of the final speech scene. I will give credit the way it's delivered is done well. Again this film proves why Al Pacino is a extraordinary actor. Keanu is alright but Nic Cage would have been a better choice.<br/><br/>7.3/10"
"tonynworah","8","1","2","8 November 2010"," They won't see this coming!
","""They don't see me coming"" In essence, that captures the strategy of the devil. We never see that evil ancient fella coming until it is too late. And that was one of the philosophies guiding the Devil charmingly played by Al Pacino. The advice is given to his protégé Kevin Lomax a brilliant and ambitious lawyer who has never lost a case.<br/><br/>The Devil's Advocate is a guilty pleasure that will surely offend puritan Christians. The Firm meets Angel Heart. Keanu Reeves is Kevin Lomak a Southern lawyer seduced by a very rich New York law firm headed by the mysterious John Milton(Al Pacino). It is the dream of every young professional. A huge salary, a large apartment, designer suits, flashy cars, the whole perks. In the background is his sexy wife (Charlize Theron)who is the first target of the the law firm, and his Christian mother who has a deep secret of her own.<br/><br/>All these characters will eventually collide in their course to find different types of redemption starting from when Lomax agrees to work for the firm. The horror of what he has gotten himself into slowly begins to unwind and the watchers are drawn into the eternal metaphorical saga of the battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>The strenght in this movie lies squarely on the indomitable shoulders of Good Old Pacino. His performance was certainly dazzling, even though a little bit over the top sometimes. It was obvious that he was enjoying his role as Old Nick. His presence on the screen was mesmerizing and his lines, were outrageous, disturbing, profane and yet spellbinding.<br/><br/>He was ably supported by Charlize Theron who keeps on proving that she is more than just a pretty face. Her evolution from a woman excited at her husband's sudden success to a terrified screaming lunatic was top shot. That woman can act! To me the film's greatest shortcoming was Keanu Reeves himself. He has never impressed me with his thespian skills, and true to form his performance was just average.<br/><br/>But still the film is great with less emphasis on special effects and certainly no horrifying creature lurking around the corner. Instead the film eschewed violence to rely on the story itself to thrill us.<br/><br/>And it did."
"hall895","7","1","2","21 October 2010"," Give the Devil his due
","The Devil's Advocate is a film which is at times frustrating to watch. It's a movie of fits and starts, never really able to sustain its momentum over the entirety of its clearly bloated running time of almost two and a half hours. A couple of the key performances leave something to be desired. Keanu Reeves is rather stiff and unnatural but that's what you're going to get out of Keanu Reeves. In what was one of her first major roles Charlize Theron never seems entirely comfortable. She's not bad by any means but it's definitely not the kind of assured performance we would see from her later on in her career. The one key player you can't really find fault with is Al Pacino who does have the advantage of playing a role which is absolutely tailor-made for him. You worry that it's a part which may open itself up to the yelling and screaming and histrionics which have marked much of Pacino's later works. But here he plays things with much more calm and subtlety. At least until the climax when there are in fact plenty of histrionics. But for this character at that point in the movie it works. So no complaints there. And by that point the movie could use a little injection of life as things do begin to drag. Even as Pacino begins to go gleefully over the top there's the sense that things are a bit talky. You'd like to see less words, more action. But it works well enough and when the story completes its final twists there's a sense of, at the very least, satisfaction. You haven't seen a great movie but it pulls itself together enough to be deemed a success.<br/><br/>The story, which again could use some serious trimming as the movie goes on much too long for its own good, follows small-town Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax who has never lost a case. He is recruited by a major New York law firm so he and his lovely wife relocate to the Big Apple where we see very quickly that things are not necessarily what they seem. The head of the law firm is named John Milton and yes that name should start the alarm bells ringing. Something about this guy isn't right. Who exactly is Milton? Well that's the film's big secret, although if you've seen any of the film's promotional materials it's really not much of a secret at all. Anyhow, Lomax continues to have success but there's always the sense that Milton's pulling all the strings in the background. The interactions between these two characters are critically important and that's one of the film's bigger problems. Because Pacino, playing Milton, is so far and away a better actor than Reeves, playing Lomax, the relationship comes off as incredibly one-sided. Pacino totally owns these scenes and seeing as it's the Reeves character who's set up as the hero of the piece that's problematic. In fact Reeves always comes off second best no matter who's acting opposite him. Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen, Craig T. Nelson...they all get a chance to outshine Reeves and they do just that. Eventually you just have to throw up your hands and say, ""Well, that's Keanu"" and move on. His interaction with Theron, playing his wife, works somewhat better so give him a little credit for that at least.<br/><br/>Despite its faults there is much to recommend The Devil's Advocate. It's a smart story, with lots of sharp twists and turns. The production design and visual effects are outstanding, it really is a spectacular looking movie. For whatever quibbles you may have with Reeves the rest of the cast is generally very good. Pacino's the obvious standout but there are plenty of supporting players turning in fine work as well. Yes the movie goes on too long but at least it finally arrives at a satisfying destination. You get the sense the movie could have been a little better, especially if there was a lead actor better equipped to stand toe to toe with Pacino. But ultimately it works well enough to be worth your while."
"Samiam3","6","1","2","26 September 2010"," Interesting indeed, but somewhat overdone.
","the Devil's Advocate (based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman) provides rousing drama with satisfactory flair and presentation. At the same time however, the story is equally heavy and cumbersome. With each chapter passing, another plot component is added, which for a while makes everything all the more interesting, but at a certain point, you start to feel lost. The Devil's Advocate seems confused in direction. In an attempt to answer all the questions that are posed, the movie's ending is painfully overlong and ridiculous. Well if nothing else at least it gives the cinematographer and effects department something epic to work with. The Devil's Advocate is a lengthy movie. The finished project is not uninteresting, and in fact it is frequently involving, but you get the impression that it is trying too hard.<br/><br/>As far as a Keanu Reeves film goes, this motion picture is a step in the right direction. Ironically though it doesn't qualify as a good performance. It only seems that way because he shares the screen frequently with Charlize Theron who upstages him with badness. Her delivery is so over wrought, that it denies common sense. Al Pachino is stable for a while, but during the course of the movie's last third, he goes into Scarface mode, and flies off the handle. I have yet to come across a movie in which the devil taking human form is justified in intelligence by an actor's performance. Outside of these people, (and Craig T. Nelson) nobody else in the cast serves a function other than killing screen time. So much goes on in the Devil's Advocate, but too little of it becomes important. <br/><br/>As a thriller, The Devil's Advocate finds success. A good word to use would be 'startling'. I can recommend the film on the grounds that it feels original and viscerally entertaining, but it lacks a sense of fluidity or general intelligence. It could use a bit of a reworking."
"uysalerturul","8","1","2","17 December 2009"," not flawless but should be seen
","First thing to be said about this movie is that it doesn't deserve a 7.3. The beginnings of the film may even be considered as boring and court scenes are ordinarily impressive, the quality of attorney defenses that we can see in any other movie. When I was getting bored, Al Pacino came. He just keeps the movie one step ahead only with his talking. He was very impressive, also the quotations that was made throughout the movie was a great taste of this movie. Both John Milton and Kevin Lomax characters are perfectly described and played by Pacino&Reeves. Charlize Theron was quite a success, too. In the scenes she go nuts, which she does a couple times in movie, I couldn't expect more from her. The ending was somehow expected, he would give up, yes, and if he would just die there, that would not be the happy end. He just went back and started over, that part was ""too happy"", it didn't have to end that well. Overall, the movie is over standards, and at least should be watched for Al Pacino's great performance. I'd give a nine, but I think it deserves more like 8.3, so it's a 8/10."

Going for a more traditional style of story telling as opposed to a heavy effects laden one, Hackford's movie was met with a mixed reception by critics and horror aficionados alike. Not surprisingly, because although it has horror elements in it, the film is more a cunningly crafted thriller embracing ethics, power, sex and prestige. All structured around a classical type villain and his new favourite protégée. A touch overlong, the film however is always interesting, be it Mary-Ann's slow decent into borderline madness, or the legal and court room morality on show. There is a lot to take in and enjoy here, even stuff to admire.<br/><br/>Pacino gives one of his effervescent performances as Milton, and it's not hard to see why he was tempted in to take on this role. He gets to swagger with a glint in his eye, and the finale gives him license to shout a lot. Vintage Pacino really. Reeves is the perfect foil to Pacino's scene stealing's, and a pre-famous Theron is gorgeous and really heartfelt in what is the films pivotal character. Good support comes from Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen and Craig T. Nelson. To leave a good film working from a good source story, to which The Devil's Advocate rewards if one can lower horror expectations and expect a more genre molded picture. 7/10"

With pretty wife Mary Ann (an ill looking Charlize Theron) in toe things seem perfect except that his new employer is the devil Lucifer himself! Things begin to turn ugly and Lomax soon realizes that there is a price to pay to work for Milton  his soul. Al Pacino does well to spew his venom but somehow not enough. Keanu looks confused as always, an expression that has not left him from his 'My Own Private Idaho's ' days while Theron is reduced to being hysterical and showing skin. There is also Connie Nelson as the seductress in the office, bait Milton uses to buy Lomax's soul with if you please.<br/><br/>What might confuse people is that what devils advocate actually stands for - is it a supernatural thriller or some sort of a commentary on the declining moral standards of the American legal system or simply a rant against evil corporations. Well actually it could stand for all these and yet not and there in lies the problem, there is no specific focus. At one point of time late in the film the director is busy portraying biblical similarities to just drive in the point that Al Pacino is indeed the devil but by then everyone knows that. <br/><br/>Nevertheless the devils advocate is watch able thanks to its elaborate set designs from the over the top finale to the water garden where Milton offers Lomax manhattan and more. Some of the one-liners that Milton shoots like 'Guilt is like a bag of fuc**in' bricks. All ya gotta do is set it down.' also keep you occupied.<br/><br/>With an anti climax that most mid nineties movies usually had, the devils advocate will just be remembered as another one of those idea movies where in some out of work scriptwriter decided to write a movie plot after reading the title phrase somewhere.<br/><br/>Recommended for a no brainer 'god fearing' Friday night at home."

","He may not be the film's central character, but John Milton is the best part of ""The Devil's Advocate."" John Milton is a role that only Al Pacino could do. It's the kind of film that Al Pacino is born to do, and he sinks his teeth into it.<br/><br/>Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hot-shot lawyer who has never lost a case. This pushes his vanity to the extreme, so much so that the truth really doesn't matter, he just wants to win. This attracts the attention of John Milton (Al Pacino), who offers him a job that's too good to refuse. His lovely but increasingly unstable wife (Charlize Theron) at first supports him, but she begins to fall apart quickly.<br/><br/>Even without its little touches and in-jokes, ""The Devil's Advocate"" would be a great film. But the story is taken to the next level with its little ironies (as in the the fact that the Devil is the head of a big law firm, and he chose the name John Milton).<br/><br/>What's really surprising is that this film lives up to repeat viewings. Most films with twist endings lose much, if not all, of their effect after the first viewing. While ""The Devil's Advocate"" will probably be a better experience if the viewer knows nothing about it, it still works even if you know that Milton is the Devil. That said, it's kind of obvious even without watching much of the film. Luckily, director Taylor Hackford understands this. While the truth of Milton's real identity is sort of a mystery, it isn't the film's only mystery, nor is it the film's biggest twist. That, and it's kind of obvious early in the film.<br/><br/>Special effects are usually only good in big budget summer action flicks. But ""The Devil's Advocate"" is not an action flick, and it has some impressive visuals.<br/><br/>The acting is great all around. Pacino undoubtedly owns this film, but his co-stars are not lacking in the acting department. Keanu Reeves is notorious for being as wooden as a fence post, but his performance here won't help that argument. Reeves is great here. He uses subtlety in his performance, but he displays a larger range of emotion than in many of his other movies. Charlize Theron also gives a great performance, showing that she's a force to be reckoned with. A lesser capable actress could have gone way over the top, but Theron uses restraint. Craig T. Nelson is probably the weakest member of the ensemble, but that's okay; his character is rather minor and he doesn't have much screen time (that said, he provides solid support).<br/><br/>This is a movie of ideas, and it has some good ones. Not quite a horror flick, but that's not what it's trying to go for. It's more of a drama/thriller, but it's always engaging and never boring. And Al Pacino is great to watch, as always."

","Well, I like this kind of movie. From first to last this thriller makes us asking questions. And that's why I love this movie from my first viewing back in 1999. till yesterday, when I watched it again on TV. All right I admit; I probably catch it once more during that period. But with movies like this you don't get bored. You only notice some new details, or you watch just how one man acts. 9 years ago I was watching Pacino, because of him I lend this movie from video and yesterday I watched this movie as whole, with all its main actors, including Reeves and Theron. I don't want to talk about the whole script and about biblical meaning. This comment is about actors and about actors only.<br/><br/>Plot is about young lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who comes to New York from Florida, so he can work in the most powerful law firm in the world. His mother Alice (Judith Ivey) disagree with his decision but all Kevin wants is to make money and try to live happy life with his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Law firm is in the hands of powerful and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino). Soon, Kevin is sinking in his new cases and pays less and less attention to his wife, who feels homesick and has all sorts of bizarre thoughts connected with devil.<br/><br/>I just love to watch performances from actors in these sort of movies. Al Pacino is one of my favorite male actors (with Depp, Brando and Dean) and his performance is stunning as usual. He plays with his role maybe a little too much, but we can all forgive such genius. He will probably never disappoint any of his fan. Such a perfect choice for role of John Milton.<br/><br/>Charlize Theron. What to say after another great role? Theron gives us best performance from all three star actors. She is so convincing and she plays perfectly her role right till the end. You just gotta love her. An Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is our young lawyer and he really looks like one but this is not his role. He can't pull this movie on another level. He is trying so hard to act in some scenes but he just can't. In court room he is very good and all the scenes in which there isn't Theron are also good. Actually in scenes with Pacino, Pacino is letting him to act, so we can view his talent. Pacino with his experience is trying to help Reeves and you can't say that Reeves is bad in any scene with Pacino. He is just ordinary. I would like to remind you about one movie that was made also in 1997. ""Donnie Brasco"". Pacino helps Depp too, but Depp outshines Pacino in some scenes which is not the case with Reeves. Reeves is good and cool actor, but he'll never be great. That's just my opinion. You can either like it or not. Like every other thing in life."

He met John (Pacino) and learned what it meant to ""do anything"" to win. There are some interesting twists here that make the movie so much more interesting. I wouldn't want to spoil them for you.<br/><br/>Also, the movie has the luscious Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife. Needless to say she has to be removed for John's plans to come to pass.

","One had to expect only the most memorable results from an association between Taurus Films and Warner Bros. - and as much as I disagree with many elements of the end product, 1997's The Devil's Advocate certainly is that; memorable...<br/><br/>I lament the fact though that, like quite a few other similar offerings, it offered only the most violent and repulsive resolution as a possible means of triumph over evil. I guess that they catered to the most obvious common denominator in doing so, and since almost everyone out there would take the easy way out if they were faced with the Adversary himself, they thought that it was the way ""to go"" - literally... Also, quite obviously, almost everyone else out there is self-loathing to the extreme, so double the reason right there to go this route, I suppose.<br/><br/>Neiderman's novel, which served as the basis for this one, was itself inspired by various other opuses, it is evident, as the movie itself is reminiscent of previous fare in the same genre as well... Disappointing, as is the choice of first name for the actual advocate here...!<br/><br/>The devil's DAUGHTER though is a true and true temptress... No disappointment there!<br/><br/>Not one but TWO suicides mar ""The Devil's Advocate"" - first, the poor MaryAnn, portrayed magnificently by Charlize Theron (between this and being ""The Astronaut's Wife"", she really doesn't know how to pick'em! May have been why she turned into a Monster afterwards...?) And then the title character himself (it still feels awful to call any lead character ""Kevin"" - let's say Keanu instead! Darn - that sounds odd too... Not as much though! At least, this isn't a Bill & Ted feature... *Whew*!). And it is not quite acceptable to wipe everything off at the end and still have the mandatory ""happy ending"" - complete with EVIL STILL LURKS AND IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT DEFEATED AT ALL after taste - after TWO GRUESOME SUICIDE SCENES! At least, ""Fallen"" was not so hypocritical and stuck with its ""very unhappy ending"" - for pure logic's sake! Both films err in the same manner anyway though - to pretend that the only way to elude an opponent such as the ultimate Adversary (no, it isn't Death! Death is, in many ways, either but a tool or even a friend...!) is through auto-destruction and nothing else is simply the WRONG MESSAGE TO SEND... There's no either way to battle the devil in Tinseltown? In real life there are plenty: crucifixes, holy water, prayer! Alas, none of these are regular props in these flicks... Lots of kiddies watch these films, you know! Hollywood has to be more careful with this sort of thing... They want not to spread such things as ""piousness"" and ""faith"" now...! We dare not offend nor alienate all the other beliefs now...! As it already the case, only the sun will destroy vampires - lest we make them vulnerable to ALL symbols of ALL religions, we make them invulnerable to all and do not even broach the subject anymore! Alas, the first bloodsucker, Dracula (or Polidori's character that prefigured Drac...) were NOT vulnerable to the sunlight but were vulnerable to other things... Guess what it was now!<br/><br/>No heroes should simply escape the conflict by blowing themselves up... Hopefully, Jack Sparrow never considered eluding Davy Jones' Locker Room by offing himself too now! Surely not; it is a Disney movie and they want another sequel anyway!<br/><br/>I know that I lauded Al Pacino's performance in Carlito's Way - but, here, I shall remain silent about his histrionics as ""the devil""...<br/><br/>It is amusing though to note that both ""Fallen"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"" (as also ""Interview With A Vampire"", of course) had a Rolling Stones song playing as they finally rolled the end credits... Sexagenarian, sex-obsessed rock'n'rollers who are STILL going strong; they must have indeed struck a deal with the devil (but they're not vampires - no) - hence the music fits on more than one level here!"

","Lawyers in the Western world seem to be the profession with the most powerful mythology towards the general public. When taking a taxi to reach the court of appeal in my native Greece the taxi driver asked me whether I have seen this film. I just laughed. Series like L.a. Law and movies like that have given the impression to the average movie-goer of the West that lawyers are some form of super-human elite controlling society through their machinations. In reality lawyers in the Balkans are struggling over-populated profession seeking to keep up appearances while other professions without such a tradition of ridiculous pretensions and antiquated conventions offer their practitioners a happier and simpler life.<br/><br/>I could not believe that such mythology could be generated nowdays. The sexual politics of the movie are a muddle. The incurssions to horror unsuccessfully. The presentation of the international connections of the legal company ridiculous.<br/><br/>The concept of the is really very clever but the execution does not live up to it."

You get not one but two good looks at Charlize Theron's amazing tits. You also get a full frontal of Connie Nielsen as well as a couple of good looks at her tits. Absolutely top-notch nudity. I give this movie ten out of ten nipples. Keanu Reeves acting is fine, although his southern drawl sounds quite fake in a few scenes. Al Pacino is great through most of the movie, though a bit over the top in one scene.

He is lured into the firm and he and his wife, Mary Anne (Charlize Theron) to New York.<br/><br/>At first they are seduced by the posh lifestyle, but slowly, the lifestyle takes on a dark turn. As the secrets of the law firm are revealed, they see that there is more to the charming Mr. Milton than first meets the eye.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful, but I have to say that Pacino stole the movie for me. He is sexy, creepy, seductive and scary, some times all at once. Reeves finally shows that he can be more than just the space-cadet, Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure. We also get to see the first glimmer of incredible from Theron, the kind of incredible people finally recognized in Monster.<br/><br/>The cinematography is so good that it becomes part of the movie in a way that few movies do. There are only a few sweeping vistas of New York City, but that doesn't mean the rest of the cinematography isn't spectacular in it's own way.<br/><br/>The score blends in with the plot well, moving the story along, but not leading you to far ahead. You can tell the writer knows the bible well and weaves the knowledge throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is well worth seeing."

I am going to have to watch ""The Devil's Advocate"" again, just to see where...well, you'll see what I mean if you watch it. When this movie came out, I had never heard of Charlize Theron (although she had already starred in ""That Thing You Do!""), but she showed the same chops that she would later bring to ""Monster"" and such movies.

Pacino is a given, as is, to some extent, Theron, but I was surprised(happily so) by both T. Nelson and Jones. The plot is interesting and involving, and the way it develops is great. The pacing is very good, I was hardly ever bored, despite it being a bit over usual feature film length in running time. The film is laced with style, and it works wonderfully to the film's advantage. The characters are well-written and credible. The film contains a select few grand parodying references to Rosemary's Baby and Scarface. Pacino is, quite literally, on fire. He's simply marvelous as The Dark Prince. The score is magnificent. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. The film is thoroughly entertaining, filled to the brink with suspense and, while somewhat moralizing near the end, highly satirical as far as religion goes.

All the characters are cool, and the story is pretty good, plus Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves are simply amazing in this!. It does run a little too long,and I wish they would have kept the ending where Kevin rejects Satan instead of the typical predictable ending, however those are minor things as I really enjoyed this movie, plus I must give credit to Charlize Theron as well she gave a fantastic performance!. Reeves and Theron had very good chemistry together, and some moments really surprised me, plus all the characters were extremely likable. It actually has a couple of pretty creepy scenes, and Pacino is wonderfully OTT, plus this is one of Keanu's best performances in his career!. It's very well made and written, and this movie gets surprisingly bloody at times! plus Connie Nielsen is great and super sexy in this!. This is great fun all the way, I didn't care for the ending too much, however this is a very solid film with 2 amazing performances from Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Taylor Hackford does a very good! job here with excellent camera work, good angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Al Pacino is amazing as always and is amazing here, he hams it up big time and is totally OTT, and I absolutely loved it, he was so much fun to watch, and really seemed to be enjoying himself, he also had some wonderful lines, and played one of his coolest characters!, I loved him!. (Pacino Rules!!!!!). Keanu Reeves is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he gives one of his absolute best performances, had very good chemistry with Charlize Theron, is fantastic in the acting department, was on top of things, was very believable and had plenty of charisma to spare! (Reeves!!!!!!!). Charlize Theron is stunningly gorgeous and is fantastic here,she played a cool emotional character had very good chemistry with Reeves, and while it may be dwarfed now due to her incredible performances in her recent Oscar worthy films I still consider this to be a fantastic performance! (Theron Rules!!!!). Connie Nielsen is extremely sexy and did very good with what she had to do I really liked her. Judith Ivey is great as Kevin Lomax's mom, and was quite intense at times I liked her. Craig T. Nelson is fantastic in his small role, and while he didn't have much to do, his great screen presence was always felt. Jeffrey Jones is good as Eddie. Rest of the cast do fine.

"esteban1747","8","1","2","7 May 2005"," Gogol would have not done better
","In the classic Russian literature you find several writers always asking themselves about the dilemma between God and the Evil, one of them was Gogol, much more idealistic than Dostoyevski. This film reminded me Gogol, from time to time Dostoyevski's ""Brothers Karamazov"", and also José Saramago's ""Jesus Christ Gospel"" because of its strong religious argument probably arguable according to each one'believes. It is true XX century belongs to evil, too many wars and disasters. The modernization and industrialization haven't prevented the problem instead the situation became tougher and troublesome all over. The vanity of the man goes beyond simple ambitious of moderate wealth, he/she always wants more and more, not taking into account that there are others having nothing, just surviving or living for a while. This film goes deep into these matters, and is worth to be seen by all, particularly in industrialized societies. Al Pacino was the real evil, but a reasonable one, his arguments unfortunately were not debated as I would like; Keanu Reeves played the role of an ambitious lawyer, who knows everything and wins all processes, he killed his family, his feelings and his life, while Charlize Theron was the victim of this disgrace. It is advisable to read the novel of Andrew Neiderman before seen the film. In any case, the director Taylor Hackford was able to assemble well the plot and scenes of this film full of morale."
"karbonkeltje","8","1","2","8 April 2005"," Great chemistry
","What is it with Keanu Reeves and great actors? He has played opposite some of the best actors of our time: magnificent actors and actresses such as Gene Hackman, Anthony Quinn, William Hurt, Cate Blanchett, Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, not forgetting the late River Phoenix (who had the potential to become one of the greatest actors of his generation),Â… (I'm forgetting a couple of names here). Playing opposite a brilliant actor makes him raise his own acting game, so it seems. Is it because, like somebody else mentioned, he creates a space for those actors to work in? Is that the reason why he has such fantastic chemistry with these actors and actresses?<br/><br/>Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors. My favorite movie with him is still Dog Day Afternoon, though. In The Devil's Advocate, he goes over the top with his performance but if there's one role where you can get away with that, than it's this one: playing the devil. He goes over the edge in some scenes but all in all, it was a joy to watch him and the scriptwriters sure did give him some great lines.<br/><br/>It's a known fact that it's not easy to act opposite this man. It's so easy to be blown away by him but Keanu Reeves manages to hold his own and that says something about his underrated talent, I should think. It's just because 'Keanu creates the space' that Al Pacino is given the room to go over the top. The acting styles of those two actors work very well together.<br/><br/>Another proof that Keanu has some brilliant chemistry with good actresses is shown in this movie. Charlize Theron. Now, the only problem I had with this movie was the rapid descend into craziness. It's not Theron's fault because she works very well with what she's been given and it wasn't all bad but I wished for a bit more subtleness in those scenes.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>I would have preferred a different ending, though. For me, they should have stopped right after the big confrontation between the devil, Kevin and his sister and right after Kevin's dramatic decision. The last scenes were an anti-climax.<br/><br/>***END SPOILER***<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is great and it's given me food for thought! Recommended!"
"dbdumonteil","7","1","2","23 February 2005"," Satan accepted Kevil Lomax's soul...
","American justice has always been at the heart of many American films. A lot of them have showed lawyers as main protagonists who defend victims with respect of justice. ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997) which presents a new and worthy variation on the myth of Faust exploits an idea we have rarely seen on the screen: a lawyer ready to do anything to succeed, even to defend doubtful cases. Moreover, if the supernatural is an integral part of the whole, we can expect to watch a promising movie. So, here's the story: Keanu Reeves acts a young and ambitious lawyer, Kevin Lomax who can pride himself of not having lost a sole trial throughout his career. One day, he gets in touch with a prestigious law firm in New York run by the charismatic and mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino) who offers him a golden job doubled with a comfortable income. Of course, Lomax doesn't think twice before accepting and so he leaves his natal Florida with her bride Mary-Ann (Charlize Theron) to live in New York. After this, the young lawyer thinks he has reached the top but in the meantime, doubt gnaws away at him until he discovers terrible truths: he has defended criminals, his private life is broken and Milton's real identity will reveal itself before his eyes.<br/><br/>If I'm not totally satisfied with ""the Devil's Advocate"", it's because I think the outcome is largely telegraphed. Besides, even before seeing the movie, you can guess how it is going to end: the title and especially the cover speak volume about the conclusion: a benevolent Al Pacino taking Keanu Reeves under his wing. In another extent, if I look into the movie's references I realize that they are echoes of ""Angel Heart"" (1987) by Alan Parker and the story heavily borrows from ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) Roman Polanski's masterpiece. Indeed, Charlize Theron's attitude is strongly reminiscent of Mia Farrow's. And just look at the big and somewhat disturbing apartment in which she and Reeves settle. It resembles a lot to the one in ""Rosemary..."". But on the other hand, ""the Devil's Advocate"" will influence a few forthcoming movies like ""End of Days"" (1999).<br/><br/>In spite of all, I don't intend to slag ""the Devil's Advocate"" off. The director Taylor Hackford well fulfilled his pledges and delivers, here a well-crafted thriller in spite of the foreseeable nature that clutters it up. As for the scriptwriters, they don't do properly one of their main jobs which is to write a suspenseful script as much as possible. There are also a few holes and one can judge the last images as a little incoherent with the rest of the story. But the authors make up for it by favoring a slow but sure rise of anxiety through Reeves' descent into hell marked out by Theron's progressive madness. And by delaying as much as possible the final revelation, they hold the viewer breathless all the time of the movie. And concerning the dialogs, let's hail some well found cues (I am an humanist!).<br/><br/>Among the other qualities we can attribute to Hackford's movie: a good use of secondary characters like Lomax's mother. We could expect her to occupy a decorative part and however her role is indispensable to light and to understand certain points of the story. In another extent, ""the Devil's Advocate"" is supported by a very careful photography which confers the movie a strong visual appeal, notably through New York's buildings and the interior of Milton's law firm as big as the devastating corruption which reigns in them. To a second degree, Hackford's movie can be read as a biting denunciation of the American judicial system's abuses and injustices. This critic is directed at unscrupulous lawyers carried away by success and money and ready to defend accused people guilty of a more or less serious offense who are eventually acquitted. In this way, Hackford's bitter critic kicks the bull's eye and at the end of the movie, there's a quite relevant morals which aims a positive objective.<br/><br/>At last, about the cast, there's nothing to say about Al Pacino, the role of Satan suits him well and concerning Keanu Reeves, it is his second best performance to date after ""Matrix"" (1999). So, ""the Devil's Advocate"" (1997) isn't free from shortcomings but the above-mentioned positive aspects are eloquent to make you want to watch this film."

I lost track of the dude's point: too much shouting.<br/><br/>Reeves: good from the get-go with his dark ""I'm gonna win"" sin-grin in the bathroom mirror, which was spookier than all Pacino's subsequent screaming. The accents weren't good, but Charlize and Keanu (and everyone else) make Pacino look like a one-trick-pony trying hard to be scary.<br/><br/>Charlize's heartbreaker suicide scene is the scariest, most compelling in the movie.

True, Keanu Reeves does play the leading role with an accent akin to a highschool performance, but his script together with Charlize Theron's break-out role more than make up for this. Also, who can forget the great Al Pacino- who plays an even more sinister character than his usual Mob associated roles- Satan himself. His raspy voice and fiery temper fit perfectly with Connie Nielson (Empress from The Gladiator) as the sensual temptress from Hell. The twist at the end was completely unexpected, as the events leading up to it were very plausable and well pulled off. I give it a 7/10 which is choice considering I prefer comedies."

","This movie is basically about a lawyer working for Satan. How stereotypical, right? Lawyers in the service of the devil, how original...However, this movie is actually pretty decent considering. A far cry from more accurate, albeit still immensely fake, depictions of lawyers like Law & Order, The Devil's Advocate is the story of a man, played by Keanu Reeves, who goes from obscurity all the way to the top, with the help of Satan, of course. The acting is decent, with Al Pacino being the highlight (as always). Charlize Theron plays Reeves' wife. She does a pretty decent job and she's definitely attractive.<br/><br/>This is definitely not your average John Grisham based movie. The focus is more on the characters and not the law itself. Do not expect a traditional legal thriller. In the same sense, however, do not expect a true horror movie either. This movie is a half-hearted attempt at both, without getting either one right. It reminds me of The Ninth Gate, in that respect. Not scary or really thrilling but still interesting.<br/><br/>I think I liked this movie as much as I did because I identified with the main character, as I am interested in becoming a lawyer. For those who are not interested in law or are not lawyers, this movie may prove to be significantly less interesting and less enjoyable. All in all, a decent film. I give it a 8 out of 10. For others though, I expect the rating to be lower, more like a 5 or so.<br/><br/>Also, I'd like to point out that the accent Keanu Reeves has is probably the worst southern accent I've ever heard, especially since he's supposed to be from Gainesville, FL, my place of birth, and few people in Gainesville actually have accents, let alone that one."

It demonstrated that Evil has great staying power.<br/><br/>The Old Boy turns the passage of time into a rather elaborate hallucination when he loses in the end to Reeves's exercise of free will.  Well.  Like Scarlet O'Hara said, ""Tomorrow is another day.""  It demonstrates Evil's relentless pursuit of the soul.  There will always - always - be another temptation.  So the next time around, we can assume that his crisis of conscience will be twisted and turned against him.

"DoctorMelkor","Null","1","2","18 November 2003"," not since Milton
","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>I just want to agree wholeheartedly with the primary viewer assessment of this movie.  It is wonderful, and I am glad not to be the only one to recognize that Pacino's character's name is a joke by the Devil.<br/><br/>On that point, I just want to say that I think this movie provides one of the most convincing portrayal's of the Devil's character I've seen or read since the wonderful one crafted by Milton himself (Paradise Lost, the greatest single piece of English-language literature of all time).  As in Paradise Lost, the Devil's Advocate gives the Devil a ""realistic personality"", something almost never done in any venue.  Yes, the character is so passionately acted that some have accused Pacino of overacting, but a spirit so passionate as to actually vow eternal war against God, whom he knows from personal experience to be Omnipotent, has got to be pretty fiery (if you'll pardon the term).  In Devil's Advocate, like in Milton, the Devil's statements and arguments are pretty persuasive if you're not careful, and you might be halfway convinced that the writer is on his side. This is important, because at first glance it's hard to imagine why a supernaturally intelligent being would commit himself to a hopeless battle against his all-powerful Creator.  Because of this, I at least always have the sneaking misgiving that the Devil must be a moron, at least when you consider things practically.  This movie presents him as a being who can be pretty convincing, almost idealistic, in his reasons for rebelling, though no doubt he's not being completely honest.<br/><br/>As far as the people who keep putting down Keanu Reeves, I agree with the writer of the primary commentary that he is an underrated actor and wrongly maligned.  True, he is not an a par with Pacino, but he certainly can hold his own with him.  There must be something there, because he's been in many movies with some of the best actors in the business, and always comes across just fine.  For those people who have some axe to grind against him I have the following advice:  Don't go to see his movies!<br/><br/>In summary, I really loved this movie, even more than eating large quantities of chocolate."

","'The Devil's Advocate' is one of my favorite thrillers of the nineties. It is not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Seven' but it gives the same pleasure to watch it. What Anthony Hopkins and Kevin Spacey did to those two movies is what Al Pacino does to this. They make great villains and although they do horrible things you admire them in a way. They are the best thing in movies like this.<br/><br/>(Minor spoilers.) Al Pacino is the Devil himself here and when someone tells him that the only thing worse than not having a father was having hers, he simply replies: ""I can relate. I can, believe me."" You just have to chuckle when you hear this.<br/><br/>Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a hotshot lawyer in Florida who never lost a case. He is approached by a firm from New York to come work for them. John Milton (Al Pacino) is the head of this firm. Kevin's wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) is thrilled with the thought of living in New York at first, but slowly things change. She has creepy visions and she knows things are not as they seem. Kevin's mother, a strong religious person, also feels that things are not good. Around here we learn who Milton really is.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice surprises, some of them you might expect, but others are really surprising. What happens I will not reveal, but Pacino's speech near the end, which starts with the words ""let me tell you about God"" is great, funny and more than entertaining. The Devil is the perfect role for Pacino, with his charismatic appearance and his false laugh. Reeves is good enough but is almost nothing in comparison with Pacino, the gorgeous Theron does a great job and the very beautiful Connie Nielsen in a role that becomes more important near the movie's end is fine as well.<br/><br/>To see this for Pacino is enough, but there is great other stuff here. Don't miss it."

","New York lawyers are actually demons from hell! It's not hard to imagine and a great idea for a movie, but this adaptation of Andrew Neiderman's (more involving) novel is only partly successful, despite the A-list collaboration. So-so allegorical tale follows shallow hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who hasn't lost a case, and his beautiful young wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) to a prestigious NY law firm. Kevin is instantly taken under the wing of seductive head honcho John Milton (Al Pacino) and seduced by more than just the money, but the lack of decent morals are a turnoff and his simple-minded wife has an even more miserable time of it. It's because Pacino is actually Satan!<br/><br/>The greed-isn't-good theme is old hat, and like Mike Nichol's WOLF, it borrows a lot of vintage horror film ideas, but dodges genre identification. Reeves is better than expected, but still never wholly convincing in a role that requires a stronger actor and Pacino fans will have to have patience, because he's completely restrained until the finale finally lets him rant and rave. Theron is most impressive as the troubled wife...the main victim of the manipulation and real horrors of the story (and a real cutie, besides).

","Keanu Reeves plays Kevin Lomax, a young Florida attorney who makes a name for himself by winning - all the time - even when defending some less than savoury characters, and even though he has to battle personal demons (no pun intended) as his conscience is continually wounded by his business. After one particularly noteworthy courtroom victory, he's approached by a prestigious New York law firm headed by - wait for it - old Satan himself, played superbly and hilariously by Al Pacino. Pacino alone makes it worth watching this movie. He shines as the Prince of Darkness. Although the movie isn't really intended as a comedy, it's a hilarious parody of the law profession as we note how easily the devil fits into this particular line of work.<br/><br/>A very strong cast backs up Pacino and Reeves. Charlize Theron plays Mary Ann (Lomax's lonely wife,) who is excited at first about moving to New York, then learns to truly hate the place. Jeffrey Jones puts on an interesting performance as Eddie Barzoon, the managing director of the firm - interesting because he did a pretty good job and made a definite impression even though he played a character who I thought was very poorly developed. Tamara Tunie put on a wondrously sultry and sensual performance as Jackie Heath, the wife of one of Lomax's new law partners, who befriends Mary Ann.<br/><br/>No doubt this is about as far-fetched as they come, but the ending - which I have to confess I didn't see coming - makes some of that understandable.

","Introduction: The Devil's Advocate is an excellent horror film about a young successful lawyer who has never lost a case. Even when he knows his client is guilty, he always manages to turn things around so that it seems he is innocent. That makes him a good lawyer, but a bad person. When Kevin is offered a job at the world's best known law firm, he moves with his wife to New York. There he proves his reputation as reckless lawyer, but his success has a price. From the moment he meets John Milton, the head of the law firm, strange things happen to him and his wife. Their life slowly changes into a living hell.<br/><br/>Comment: this is, in my opinion a very controversial film. There will be some who will love it, and some who'll hate it. I belong to those who love it. Many people will find this hard to watch entirely, because of the amount of gore and nudity. Also, the movie is mean-spirited as a whole, some of the things people do in this film are simply very bad. However, viewers who understand that this is a movie about the devil, which means there will be some gory parts and sexuality, will love this movie. It is a very twisted and scary film, that not everyone will enjoy. But it's a thrilling and emotional roller coaster ride from beginning to end. I recommend it to horror fans."

","This is the first movie I've ever seen with Al Pacino, and it made me a fan. I saw some of his other movies and loved those as well.  He is like Nicholson in the sense that he somewhat overacts, but also like Nicholson, he makes it work.  How can you not overact when you're playing the devil anyway?  Keanu Reeves also does a great job, even if his southern drawl comes and goes.  This is one of his first ""real adult roles,""  especially after ""Bill and Ted"" and ""Love You to Death.""  Speed was an adult role of him sort of, but still not what is seen here.  It's a great movie, and the plot is simple, however I didn't completely understand what was happening to Milton at the end.

I have to say that Pacino was fantastic; right up there with his performance in Heat or Scent of a Woman. The last 30 minutes of this movie grab you by the ear-lobe and punish you for not understanding what good filming and acting are all about.  Take another look at it.  Fine acting and fine writing.

","This movie was a very good movie. It was amazing seeing how disturbed Keanu's wife was becoming, and it all seemed to keep coming together.<br/><br/>But I think that the greatest part of this movie was the acting.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I noticed that Keanu Reeves is actually a good actor. I saw him in the Matrix and thought that he gave a horrible performance, but I now know that there is something else to Keanu's acting. Keanu Reeves does not show you he is acting. Instead he portrays reality, thus making his role more down to earth. I find this to be an even better kind of acting.<br/><br/>Al Paccino is a great actor. The way he performs his role as Satan in this movie is very interesting, for when the movie is in it's beginnings he seems like a perfectly civil, smart, fun-loving person. But then you see what is happening, and how he represents TEMPTATION. He offers Keanu a perfect job. Keanu never loses a case. Al Paccino is surrounded by sex and sexy bodies. He does his role perfectly.<br/><br/>Keanu's wife in this movie does her role well also. She portrays an innocent girl that has such a nice future, and then when Al Paccino starts screwing her up you see how horrible this crime is only because of the way she plays her character.<br/><br/>This movie was a great movie. I saw it starting at 1:30 in the morning, so I was a little sleepy and started losing it towards the end, but I think that I was able to grasp it, even though as I am reflecting on it the end does seem a bit out of place... just see this movie while perfectly awake and you'll like it."

A little bit Rosemary's Baby with a tad of Angel Heart thrown in, Devil's Advocate doesn't deliver the dramatic punch of either of these movies.  It doesn't scare, and it almost appears it is not really trying to.

Keanu Reeves is good, but less effective- he gets a lot better in the last 45 minutes of the film though.  What really surprised me was how good Charlize Theron was, in a part designed for someone to look sexy- she did one hell of a great job. There are so many admirable things in this movie, and the whole concept was very intriguing.

"Seshet","Null","1","2","14 April 1999"," The Devil ought to sue
","Many people really enjoyed this movie, but I have to admit (in rather flaky terms) that I'm the Devil's advocate regarding this.<br/><br/>""The Devil's Advocate"" is OK. Actually, it was pretty campy. Some parts of it were so campy that they were sad. ""Advocate"" attempts to examine lofty material such as instinct versus ethics and free will, but it never reaches its goal. The material is discussed, but it's discussed so clumsily, so abruptly, and so flimsily, that the discussions seem more like an attempt to convince the viewer that this isn't really a slasher flick - that it's really a sophisticated film.  Well, it's really a poor amalgamation of thriller, slasher flick, and comedy-drama.<br/><br/>As for Al Pacino's highly-praised performance, it's pretty neat - all 30 minutes of it. It's also neat as long as you consider that Al Pacino was really playing Al Pacino. The female performers were extremely annoying. Charlize Theron, who played Kevin Lomax's (Keanu Reeves) wife, doesn't do much besides scream, whine, and take her clothes off. Otherwise, there's a lot of lesbian-like activity between supporting characters who don't do much besides sneer and touch each other's breasts. Keanu Reeves' performance is very good, but his accent really gets in the way. It's difficult to take seriously someone whose accent is not only not real but sounds like a cross between ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Deliverance."" This is not Reeves' fault; it's the director's fault. Not every southerner, certainly not every Floridian, has a southern accent. Why does Kevin Lomax need one?<br/><br/>I do give this movie credit for a great monologue (spoken by Al Pacino), interesting special effects (although not always the top of the line), and a surprise ending.<br/><br/>If you're terribly bored one evening and there's nothing good on TV, this is a night's entertainment. Even the Devil might get a kick out of it."

","""The Devil's Advocate"" is another one of those devil movies, like ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""The Omen"", and ""The Exorcist""(which I thought was very good).  But ""Devil's Advocate"" is very enjoyable.  And although it's very scary at some times, this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and maybe learn from.  It reuses the idea from ""The Exorcist""; the devil is going to take possession of someone, in order to lure and possess the ones most vulnerable to him.  However, ""The Exorcist"" was extremely serious and very tough to deal with after you finished watching it!  ""Devil's Advocate"" has a little change of heart.  It has the cool Al Pacino as the devil, and Keanu Reeves as his victim.   But instead of torturing him, Pacino simply showers him with gifts, money, and of course, women.  The women in this story weave a tapestry of irresistible temptation, which is why I think it had all the nudity in it.  And Al Pacino looks like he's having the time of his life. Pacino is usually serious in his films, but now, he's playing his role with guesto.  The only problem is, Keanu is taking this all too seriously.  He needs to lighten up a bit and attack Pacino with gusto right back.  His overacting makes him seem more vulnerable to Pacino, and to some, less likable.  But the real seriousness of the film is how Keanu proves the ""guilty"" not guilty.  It's horrifyingly true!  We live in a nation where rapists, suspected murderers, and other sickos can weasel their way out of conviction!  And worse yet, the people who are innocent are shafted and at a disadvantage, while the lawyers and criminals can get to the top of a mega-corporation.  We see it in insurance companies, where people go through ""drive-in"" health care, and the insurance managers are millionaires as a result.  It's sickening and morally wrong!  But in our country, we can get away with it!  And people like that, who is symbolized by the Keanu Reeves character, are going to come face to face with the devil in the future! That is my interpretation of it.  I highly recommend this film!  Though I warn you, there might be a few differences in the versions of the film you rent, and the versions of the film you decide to buy.  What I mean is, an ominous statue with people in it, which is seen in Pacino's penthouse, plays a key role in emphasizing the lustful temptation of Keanu.  But, the statue itself is an unauthorized reproduction of sculptor Frederick Hart's art! Hart sued, and in order to release the film on video, they released it as it was in the theatre, and eventually, re-edited the statue for the final video release.  I think that the impact of the statue wasn't as powerful, judging from the fact that the re-edited statue has no people in it!  Luckily, I purchased it on disc at the right time, before the editing took place.  Try to get the original if you can, and enjoy ""The Devil's Advocate""!"

(c) I hate (most) courtroom drama movies<br/><br/>I saw the movie on video last night and was...... very pleasantly surprised. Reeves was pretty good - 100% believable in the role.  Every member of the supporting cast were fantastic and Pacino was excellent but in a very unconventional, unlikeable way.  His John Milton seemed, at turns, to (deliberately I think) parody his Godfather, Scarface and even Scent of a Woman characters.  One of my favourite movies of all time is Angel Heart. This movie is the only thing that has even come close to reaching the same sinister/inward-spiraling/reality-bluring atmosphere of that earlier movie. There was so much about TDA that was impressive.  Sure, the ending was (somewhat) predictable but the way in which it was resolved was extremely imaginative and thought provoking.  I was glad that the sfx were not allowed to ""take over"" the movie which is a common failing in these CGI-prevalent times.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent, chilling movies.  One last point: Shouldn't the Rolling Stones fadeout track have been ""Sympathy for the Devil""?"

This would work as a serious drama and maybe it could as a comedy but the casting of Keanu Reeves in the lead ruins any chance that it could make it either way. Reeves like Kyle McGlaughin is a wonderful android as far as his range as an actor goes. His emotionless script reading could let him play a good accountant or maybe he could do a parody of himself in the future if they ever revive Leslie Neilson's comedy roles. But for now his presence and DeNiro's tendency to overact ruin what is a good screen play. The ending is also too predictable and a wonderful plot is wasted."

Perhaps unfortunately, the film is entirely lacking in suspense, since we know Pacino's the devil from the beginning... everything draws to a very inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't find very believable is Keanu Reeve's characters' final action (I won't give it away in case you haven't seen the film).  The guy plays an incredibly self-centered, egomaniacal sort of person, so what he does is pretty unbelievable and out of character... it seems much more likely he'd go ahead and ""strike a bargain,"" so to speak, given his actions & motivations up until nearly the last moments of the film.<br/><br/>Just a final observation... I've seen Keanu Reeves playing characters both dead and alive, and amazingly he doesn't look any different ""playing dead"" than he does ""playing alive.""  Sometimes I wonder if Reeves is actually neither dead nor alive... is there something in between?

I'm<br/><br/>tempted to read the novel this movie was based on, if only to see if<br/><br/>the reasonably interesting premise was handled with any more<br/><br/>subtlety in print.  Because the movie is like a 2.5 hour Western<br/><br/>Union commercial, with every plot twist telegraphed an hour ahead<br/><br/>of its arrival.  Was there really anyone who didn't recognize that<br/><br/>Pacino was supposed to be Satan the moment they learned his<br/><br/>character was named John Milton?  Could the endless succession of demons and specters have been a clue? And all the while, Keanu and Charlize Theron just keep drawlin'<br/><br/>and Al keeps shoutin' and it all leads up to what, exactly?  The<br/><br/>flying mallet to the head moral that a scuzzy lawyer that stops at<br/><br/>nothing to win will eventually pay a price for his amorality?  Who<br/><br/>would have guessed?  Who would have cared?  But, hey, the<br/><br/>music was good.  But what was the deal with the voodoo guy and<br/><br/>the goat?  Awww, nevermind."
"adamhart-1","9","1","2","22 October 2001"," This film is a stylish, atmospheric delight!
","Like all of his movies, you have to expect Al Pacino, to be in full shouting glory.  This film is no exception as he yet again hits you head on with his passionate, high-octane screen presence.<br/><br/>The Film begins slowly but builds up Kevin Lomax's character (Keanu Reeves) well, as you quickly learn that his passion to succeed and 'never lose attitude', may actually be his weakness. His wife Mary-Ann played by gorgeous as ever Charlize Theron, is extatically happy, as Kevin is promoted to join a big shot international firm.  They move from their humble home in the South, to begin a new life, in bright lights big city, New York.  Huge pay cheque, exclusive luxury apartment and a stunning gorgeous woman, paradise....or so it would seem!<br/><br/>As Kevin begins to realise the strain of his workload, his boss John Milton (Pacino), shows signs that he not only calls the shots but is much more powerful than he's letting on.  Unfortunately Mary-Ann begins too crumble under the pressure of a new life and is distraught by seemingly deluded hallucinations.  Is it a figment of her imagination, or is what she sees, really the interceptions of Milton himself.<br/><br/>The plot is deep and interesting, as the truth awaits Kevin...who is John Milton?  I don't want to give anymore away because it was a pleasure to discover the truth but it's worth waiting for, believe me!<br/><br/>
What I was most surprised about in this film was Keanu Reeves' believable performance.  Nothing has challenged him like this role and I can safely say that you will be impressed.  Not that Keanu hasn't been immensly successful already but he definately should choose more roles like this.<br/><br/>Obviously, as Pacino cannot fail to give a awe inspiring performance to his audience, the film is launched into a web of suspense and spine twisting intrigue.  His portrayal of Milton is astonishing. No one else could have played him.  For every minute Pacino graces the screen with his powerful demeanor, he holds your attention and you want more.  He had to play this part with a sense of mystery because the whole film builds up to reveal who Milton really is.  Of course, Pacino pulls this off perfectly.<br/><br/>All in all the cast is strong, with Pacino and Reeves proving that they work well together.  Theron is also very impressive and helps the film's sinister atmosphere.  For the film it's self, not one of Pacino's best but a stylish, highly entertaining must-see.  9 out 10!"
"standforit","8","1","2","2 October 2001"," Excellently done, not about morals.
","The Devil's Advocate is less about evil and more about maximization of opportunity. I really think the movie was excelently done, with the music setting an eerie tone - as if Pacino and the enigmatic Reeves need eerie music. Pacino's character, John Milton, capitaliazes, perhaps sometimes at the expense of others. That is what makes it a movie, fiction. The extremes are very extreme. The two ladies, Theron and Nielsen, are terrific in their roles as well. I do not see this picture as a morality tale, so don't expect to see that. Watch it for the enjoyment and listen very carefully, for there are many wonderful lines of dialogue in The Devil's Advocate."
"vox-sane","Null","1","2","3 April 2001"," For Whom was this Movie Made?
","Coming near the end of the 1990s, ""The Devil's Advocate"" might well have been a parable about that decade's unmitigated greed and selfishness. However, it seems unlikely that anyone in Hollywood thinks greed and selfishness are negative things, especially the latter.  In a day when even mainline Christians and Jews downplay the devil or even subscribe to the theory that ""he"" is a convenient allegory of evil (some, unfamiliar with the Talmud, even maintain that this figure isn't even a part of orthodox Judaism).<br/><br/>That a serious movie was made about the evil one was made at all is an achievement.  Although few movies, fortunately, fall for the gnostic gnonsense that the devil is an anti-God, the archetypical figure of evil is more often played for laughs (""Bedazzled"", ""Poor Devil"") or as a misunderstood fellow who's not so bad but fell in with a bad crowd.<br/><br/>It's hardly a spoiler to mention that Al Pacino plays the devil in this film.  After all, though the film begins slowly and gradually works to that revelation, the title and all the advertisements even at the time of the film's release hardly kept it a secret.<br/><br/>Pacino makes a good devil.  Over the top, yes, but he's playing a figure who, once an angel, rebelled against God, fosters the evil within humans, and who, knowing he's ultimately defeated, wishes to destroy as many humans as he can, either bodily or spiritually.  ""The twentieth century was entirely mine,"" he says, and, mulling over twelve million killed in Nazi Germany (including six million of God's chosen people);  ten times that killed in the Soviet Union;  God only knows how many under Mao or the Khmer Rouge . . . and not just the deaths, but incredible selfishness, greed, vanity, pride . . . one wonders about the truth of that.<br/><br/>However, with so few people in the know about who the devil really is, out of touch with the theology, relying on imbecile notions of a figure in horns and a pointy tail, or vague ideas of a lingering Manichaean dualism, they can't understand that the devil is a liar;  and with no unarbitrary ideas of right and wrong, and little sense of an actual metaphysical world beyond their senses, a modern audience may wonder why a little success should be considered evil.<br/><br/>And why a lawyer?  In the 1990s lawyers, already disliked intensely, made themselves even more disliked.  James Stewart in ""Anatomy of a Murder"", Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", Raymond Burr's Perry Mason -- people with callings, trying to uncover the truth and fight evil even at the cost of their careers -- are quaint figures of the past.  The country is divided over whether O.J. is guilty or innocent, but rather closer in disdain for his ""dream team"";  a slick lawyer president slips out of a perjury rap everyone knows he committed by questioning the definition of ""is"";  tobacco companies send out lawyers in battalions to keep America safe for emphysema.  The old joke tells how the devil appeared to a lawyer, promising him success in court, a great political career, and even the presidency, if only he will give the devil his soul;  the lawyer thinks a moment and says, ""What's the catch?""  Perhaps a diabolical take on ""The Fountainhead"", making the devil's prey an architect deferring to evil through pride . . .  But Keanu is a lawyer, and we're stuck with it, and we're supposed to have some sympathy for him.  Talk about suspension of disbelief!<br/><br/>A serious movie about a subject materialistic people can't take seriously seems to be a work in vain.  And people who believe in the devil, even those who are less theologically sound no the subject, probably won't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>The writers seems uncertain about the Pacino character.  Though he gives an interesting speech about God, and though the one thing people do know about the devil is that he's a liar, he's never confronted in any way about his lack of truthfulness (in fact, most books and movies about the devil show him as being truthful in a lawyerish way, giving what people want but always finding legitimate loopholes to make their lives miserable).  And they didn't spend enough time on the idea of a parable.  Perhaps they were in a hurry, or confused parable with allegory, which -- to some extent correctly -- has fallen out of favor these days and looked on askance.<br/><br/>Of course, the production values are nice.  Only the best for Satan.  And there are nice touches.  John Milton's (Pacino) offer to Lomax (Reeves) is made on a Manhattan rooftop, similar to the temptation of Christ -- only Lomax accepts.  But a lot of the effects and some of the horror is pointless, done seemingly for the sake of slipping it in. The non-horror parts are the best.  Judith Ivey's religious mother, whose dialogue starts out sounding wacky but make's more and more sense, is the best.  Pacino brings out the heavy artillery.  Keanu is not particularly good, but he isn't expected to do much other than look cold, and react to Pacino.  That he doesn't sound ""southern"" at all is no problem -- by the 1990s the south is so homogenized accents are almost extinct;  and besides, they should only be done by the British, like Kenneth Branagh, whose accent in ""The Gingerbread Man"" is the best southern accent on film (some British accents are close kin to the old southern accent).<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Devil's Advocate"" is a noble failure, probably worthy of being seen once by open-minded viewers, and having its watered-down points and limp attempts at meaning discussed at least for a few minutes at Starbuck's afterward, and perhaps some consideration to what the unseen John Miltons are encouraging in our own lives that may be hurting others.  But a better movie could have, and should have, been made (has anyone ever thought of having priests and rabbis in to give a considered view of the evil one?)"
"yojimbo999","Null","1","2","22 March 2001"," Haha, great movie
","If just to see just how BAD Keanu Reeves can act compared to the genius of Pacino. The comparison is so bad, so overwhelming, that whenever the two are onscreen together, you feel so BAD for Keanu. the poor guy, even HE has no idea why he's such a big star. ""Whoa!"" indeed. The flick itself is pretty good, except for the lame-brained ending, which completely destroyed everything the movie built up to in the previous 2 hours. Nix the horrible ending, and end the film with the scene we all wanted to see (You KNOW what scene I'm talking about *wink wink*) and this movie would be incredible. As it stands, it's just good. <br/><br/>P.S. I'm unable to decide rather Reeves is a worst actor than Theron, or if they're both equally bad, but whenever the two are onscreen I feel like someone just stole my wallet. They are so BORING and bland. Compared to the not-always-attractive Pacino, you have NO QUESTION as to why Theron and Reeves made it as actors -- and folks, I ain't talkin' about talent here."

Al Pacino always does a wonderful job, there is no question about that.

"stamper","8","1","2","27 August 2000"," Weird flick, you make my heart tick
","This is really a weird film, trust me. I mean I've seen a couple of strange films but never have I seen such a strange one yet. That probably originated in me thinking that this would be a film about a lawyer in the style of The Firm, you know I thought it was about a young lawyer making the big hit in the city and all the problems that arise there. I had seen the commercials on TV a few years back and I was under the impression that it was about a lawyer who moves to the city and starts an affair there and gets in trouble later due to the adultery he committed. MAN I was wrong, never have I been so wrong in my life. But that being wrong' was also encouraged by the Video Store I rented it in. It said there right on the side that it was a thriller and not like a science fiction movie or something. I know this isn't genuine science fiction, but hell this ain't a genuine thriller either. I don't know what this was man, I don't know and that has never happened to me before.<br/><br/>
The question now is really was I disappointed, HELL no, it was a good film really. OK when Charlize Theron started freaking out I was like: What is this man?' but then I started getting into it and I must really say the performances helped a lot too. Keanu Reeves was good. Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen, they were good too (really). What about Pacino??? Well, Al Pacino, he was fu..ing great. He was like, damn I have never seen him so good, he was pure evil and that made you believe he was the character he portrayed. He was just the best one in the whole picture great performance, I would have liked to have seen some kind of nomination or award for that role.<br/><br/>
Although I know and feel it was a bit of a strange film, I liked it still, because it had all the elements that a good film needs, it had a good story, a good cast, good direction and of course enough excitement not to lose appeal, for it was like 144 minutes long. That's 2 hours and 22 minutes. The film was just built up in the best possible way. You really started thinking during the film and it all was kept really tasty, so it would not get too cheap and gory. Those last things were not needed too for the actors and the story were good and it was not some Urban Legend 3: This is really the Final Cut people, plus it is the best one yet'. <br/><br/>
Of course with a film like this and the actors involved there are bound to be some excellent scenes and believe me there were some. My favourite two are the whole ending with the Reeves  Pacino confrontation and of course the scene with the broken mirror (I don't want to spoil anything but that was the best scene of the sort I have ever seen).<br/><br/>
At last there is only one more thing I want to say to all of you, if you don't know what I mean with this being a strange film, let me put it like this, it reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby, but it was like million times better. Let's say it like this, this is the kind of movie I expected to see when I started watching Rosemary's Baby. Still don't know what I mean? Rent The Devil's Advocate then and do it fast.<br/><br/>

"Leofwine_draca","4","1","3","20 June 2016"," Fails to get the viewer on side
","A flashy, nauseating updating of all those '40s melodramas which had everyday folk teaming up with the devil in human form for all kinds of moral adventures, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is a huge disappointment for this viewer. Even the usually reliable Al Pacino can't save this movie, which at the end has him going way over the top with his typical shouty-shouty nonsense and making himself look like a complete fool. Despite being a high-budget production with some good makeup from old-hand Rick Baker and some brief morphing sequences, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is an annoyingly insubstantial little movie with a miscast hero in Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>Reeves of course is more suited to action fare like SPEED or THE MATRIX and scenes of him attempting to emote in this film are hard to watch, despite his pretty good attempts at being determined and forceful in the courtroom scenes. Although not without merit, and surprisingly understated for the majority of its running time, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE fails at the end in being a piece of serious drama. The first reason is because of the stupid one-liners which the film is populated with, the second the over-the-top finale which relies on bad CGI far too much and ends up being a simple slanging match between hero and villain.<br/><br/>By far the best acting on screen comes (somewhat surprisingly) from Charlize Theron (THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE), who plays Reeves's put-upon wife. Of course, it's a choice role to play and Theron is very good indeed in portraying her character's mental breakdown (on the other hand, you just want to break Keanu's nose for being such a total, blind idiot to miss what's happening around him). Some of the vignettes and subplots surrounding the main story (like the one with Jeffrey Jones, who is attacked by demonic winos) are pretty enjoyable and the film has an expensive, glossy look to it as well. It's just a shame that some restraint couldn't have been brought in over the out-of-control actors and that some real suspense and tension couldn't have been worked into the storyline; never have I been so uninterested in a movie as it nears its explosive climatic showdown, but THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE repeatedly fails to invest the viewer with any excitement or interest, which is a real shame."

","Too old for Hamlet and too young for Lear--what's an ambitious actor to do? Play the Devil, of course. Jack Nicholson did it in The Witches of Eastwick; Robert De Niro did it in Angel Heart (as Louis Cyphre--get it?). In The Devil's Advocate Al Pacino takes his turn as the great Satan, and clearly relishes his chance to raise hell. He's a New York lawyer, of course, by the name of John Milton, who recruits a hotshot young Florida attorney (Keanu Reeves) to his firm and seduces him with tempting offers of power, sex, and money. Think of the story as a twist on John Grisham's The Firm, with the corporate evil made even more explicit. Reeves is wooden, and therefore doesn't seem to have much of a soul to lose, but he's really just our excuse to meet the devil. Pacino's the main attraction, gleefully showing off his--and the Antichrist's--chops at perpetrating menace and mayhem. The film was directed by Taylor Hackford (Against All Odds, Dolores Claiborne), who provides alternate-track commentary for the movie itself, plus a dozen deleted scenes.

","First of all, Pacino.  For big bucks, this is probably the best performance as an actor as Satan in a movie.  Although John Glover is just as effective, without the hammy overacting/ranting, in ""Brimstone"" (1998).  Pacino's performance is a tour de force.<br/><br/>Although a lot of it is Pacino, the role of the Devil is also nicely scripted.  You kinda think that this is what Satan would really be like - just one of the guys, really.  A guy who knows what he wants and goes gets it, all with a perfect contempt for the Almighty.  After all, as they noted in ""Bedazzled"" (another source of much of the Satan portrayal here), God won't even let you undress in private.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, surrounding Pacino is...well, nothing.  Mr. Reeves is his normal enigmatic obtuse, emotionally bland self. Nothing is really conveyed of the character other than that he's a self-centered jerk.  Which, granted, is kinda Satan's point in the first place. <br/><br/>The rest of the characterization is...eh.  Characters come, characters go, characters brutally die.  Naked women cavort before us, which I can kinda get into, but it doesn't really contribute much.  And what's with the demon faces?  Is Satan possessing them?  Have they given themselves over to Satan? What has Mary Ann got that lets her see these ""faces""?<br/><br/>And the ending...arrgh.  A 100% copout.  I thought this kind of stuff went out with ""Dallas,"" but no such luck.  There's a (mild) twist at the very end.  Basically, they might as well have had Keanu click his ruby slippers together and say, ""There's no place like home.""<br/><br/>Overall, because I'm big on the whole good/evil God/Satan dichotomy, I gave this a marginal ""thumbs up.""

","With nearly 500 reviews behind me now, i have a good view of how Hollywood deals with book adaptation: it just picks the resume of the cover and rewrite all the content. As I have just finished the Neiderman's book, my opinion is still verified today: <br/><br/>The movie doesn't tell the same story than the book. The book was great showing the motive of a criminal lawyer (it's not about guiltiness but winning a case with law) and moving from country life to NYC. On the other hand, the book was weak with the devil, or at least, it lurks in the background. In the movie, those points have been switched: the supernatural is everywhere and the criminal law is forgotten: in fact, the ""movie"" Kevin is a fusion of the ""book"" Kevin and another advocate (the one whose wife goes crazy). <br/><br/>What's funny is that both book and movie are unintelligible with the devil's desire to have babies and above all, the role of devil: His mission is to make us do what is forbidden or not do what is ordered. Nothing in the book or in the movie illustrates this: the devil is just depicted as a seducer, a hedonist and a godfather that protects his family. <br/><br/>At last, the movie is good on its visual nature: it has good shots of NYC and has a fine cast: Theron is believable as she gets from white to black, Al is playful because I think he is a epicurean in his life too and Reeves is totally convincing especially his last scene of husband. <br/><br/>In conclusion, i think that an adaptation should adapt what's written and not rewrite."

Basically Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is the ruthless young lawyer/attorney from Florida, and is recruited by John Milton (Al Pacino), owner of the most powerful law firm in the world, in New York. Kevin goes even after his mother, Mrs. Alice Lomax (Judith Ivey), disagreed, and soon after joining, his wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) becomes homesick as she witnesses more and more devilish apparitions, and as Kevin gets more cases, he pays less attention to her. Kevin gets very freaked by how his boss John knows how to solve every situation, and after his wife's suicide, and his mother's revelation that John is his father, there is the final battle of man vs. The Devil. Also starring Jeffrey Jones as Eddie Barzoon, Connie Nielsen as Christabella Andreoli, The Incredibles' Craig T. Nelson as Alexander Cullen, Tamara Tunie as Mrs. Jackie Heath, Heather Matarazzo as Barbara and American Boxing Promoter Don King. The only problem I have with Pacino being The Devil is, how an he still walk into a church, and why does he dunk his finger in the holy water? It is pretty unbelievable, but both Reeves and Pacino make the most of their parts, and I guess it has its tiny moments that you can enjoy, but I can't say it is a great film. Adequate!"
"cosmo-bongo","5","1","5","19 June 2005"," film ruined by loud music, loud sound effects, and screaming
","I would have given this film a much higher rating, had it not been for the fact that the screaming, music, and sfx were incredibly LOUD, in effect sabotaging the movie and profoundly affecting adversely my enjoyment of it - and my wife's. I had to continually adjust the sound level and, in several passages, I turned the sound completely off. Even so, my eardrums were ringing and literally hurt.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating, DeNiro plays a compelling role - but no need to YELL so much. This is a role that needs understatement, not shouting.<br/><br/>The title reveals the main thrust of the film, unfortunately, and no one, surely, will be taken by surprise when they find out what is really going on, who's who.<br/><br/>This study of high-power attorney brokering, morals, pressures, their activities & romances is truly exciting and suspenseful, a real tour-de-force.<br/><br/>The sets are dark, trying to attain a film-noire effect, I assume. I'd have preferred more lighting or a wider lens opening. Of course, the flick itself is ""dark"" and clearly the director was striving for atmosphere; I don't feel this was necessary as the story itself unfolds well and provides its own aura. More frightening in broad daylight than in shadows or unlit corners! Certainly recommended, but keep your remote handy for the sound!"
"st-shot","5","1","6","3 June 2011"," The Devil's Advocate takes its time burning out.
","Not that he needed to but Taylor Hackford more than confirms he is no Roman Polanski in this slick modern day Gothic horror that in the course of its healthy running time (144 minutes) becomes one to endure. Poorly paced, over and under acted this slick looking bore grows more incredulous with each reel as the characters lose steam with Hackford desperately tries to inject some shock value ( a demented Charlize Theron going topless in a church being one of his grander flourishes) into this supernatural snorer.<br/><br/>Florida counselor Kevin Lomax has all the tools to make him a superb defense lawyer. When he gets the call to go to work for a firm in the majors he jumps at it. Moving to the Big Apple he joins the firm of John Milton (Al Pacino) whose piercing intensity Lomax finds both motivating and intimidating. He begins to prove himself fast and is given some big assignments over senior staff. Career wise things are going great but at home wife Mary Ann (Theron) is starting to deconstruct and there is strong suspicion Milton has something to do with it.<br/><br/>With the wooden Reaves in the lead Advocate is sore in need of one as he feigns confusion at the most obvious of ploys put forth by the evil Milton. For a guy that's supposed to be a sharp lawyer he spends an awful amount of the films running time oblivious to Hackford's heavy handed red flags. Pacino's sartorially attired Beelzebub is all wide eyed sadist and smugness with runway models replacing Gog and Magog as companions. Oozing unctuous charm and calm he toys with Lomax longer than a cat with a chipmunk and it's just about as entertaining. Theron fairs the best among the leads by tamping down her share of the hysteria but by the time Devil's Advocate arrives at its climax it has already gone to hell."
"wchngliu","3","1","8","4 July 2007"," This Is Such A Silly Movie
","The Devil's Advocate is utter pants. I wouldn't waste my time explaining the plot but it has to be one of the silliest horror movies ever made. It is a sheer letdown typified by Pacino's over-the-top and overdone performance and Reeves annoying southern accent and a narrative so ridiculous it is laughable. Then again, Reeves has never been that good of an actor himself anyway, if his previous roles are anything to go by. Charlize Theron is type-casted as the blonde bombshell and victim of distress and whilst I have seen better performances from her in this film, she is nothing more than male eye candy and thus, what else? Rather that she turns up in one scene in the nude. Likewise, the ending is just laughable and terrible. This film is total rubbish."

"caramia2002","9","0","1","19 October 2019"," The True ""Bonfire of the Vanities""
","I just watched this film for the probably 12th time. I bought it right after I first saw it on HBO, I think, and have enjoyed it ever since. It is everything the Bonfire of the Vanities wasn't, all the more shame due to the cast and source novel, not to mention, the marketing budget. They don't make them like this anymore; the script is so smart, the editing and pacing are perfect, and, although the reveal at the end is a great reveal on the first viewing, the journey then becomes the main thing. Even so-called ""good"" or award winning films of today usually pale in comparison, esp when everything is added together (and the southern accents are usually much worse than these).<br/><br/>This is the best I've seen Keanu Reeves act. Granted, they keep his lines short and sparse, as is usually done for him, but the script has been tailored to his acting style and it works. He does much more than grunt or cast looks, as he is limited to in films such as Wick or even The Matrix. What he does have is a marvelous physical presence (and I don't mean looks, although he is young and pretty here), which is used to its full extent in this film. I don't really spend much time wondering what a real actor would have added to this movie. Likewise, this part and the lines are just up the alley of Al Pacino. He was into his irritating and cliched ""acting like Pacino acting"" by this time, but he is less about being Pacino than being in character here, so easily his best performance of these years. I imagine some of his excellent speeches are lifted from the novel, but the adaptation works so so well, and he benefits from such a smart script. His small stature is used, as his lifts are noticed by Reeves early on (""they never see me coming"") and the camera never tries to hide his diminutive size. But Pacino knows how to be a presence, as he does so well here.<br/><br/>This was Charlize Theron's breakout film. She does a very credible job and you can see the actress who went on to play a role like Monster. She never falls into the horror actress trap of overacting and is perfect for the part of a naive, small town girl thrown into the deep end of NYC. This is Connie Neilsen's first film, and she is spectacular, although she mostly plays the sexy redhead, but the charisma that fueled Gladiator comes through here. I love Tamara Tunie (Tony winner), who has the meatiest role among the ""wives"". This film is jam packed with acting talent and all are used well. The only issues are the southern accents of Reeves and Theron, but they aren't horrid and better than what you see today. Easily forgiven.<br/><br/>My old DVD has the original sculpture with the people (later turned into waves after a lawsuit), but my Blu-Ray doesn't and I think it takes quite a bit away from the impact of Pacino's office. The original sculpture returns near the end, so the intent is kept, if not delayed. My copy doesn't have the WTC Twin Towers, which were removed for TV, shortly after 9/11, even though it is the theatrical release. The power and the glory of the NYC skyline, as used in this film, sorely needs them. It's all about iconic power.<br/><br/>I am not into horror films, per se, but this is not really a horror film, nor really a thriller, nor just a drama. It is rich with sub-plots, but never gets lost in them, nor are any dead ends. It is supernatural, but otherwise is genre defying. It suggests horror and violence more than it shows it (restraint!). I think the filmmakers wanted the audience to be more uncomfortable than shocked. If you love film, this is a must for your library. Not iconic, over the top great, but enjoyable, very watchable, excellent filmmaking. Glad the reviews are trending up; none were too kind on its release. One of the most underrated films ever."

","There are several great courtroom drama films and many of them may follow a similar route. With the Devil's Advocate, this film isn't just a typical courtroom drama but more so experiments with the supernatural and thriller aspects.<br/><br/>Seeing as the rating for this film is currently quite high (7.5 IMDB) and having little expectations but was expecting several twists, did not leave disappointed. The acting all around by the leads are great. As this is one of Keanu Reeves better performances, Al Pacino in playing a similar type of character and Charlize Theron in one of her earlier roles. They all shine and make the film worthwhile simply for their performances.<br/><br/>With a runtime of over two hours 20 minutes, the film paces itself and is quite layered. A lot of key details and little subplots along the way to keep entertained. Though what is predictable is that we knew there would be some twists along the way, though the twists that is revealed is quite clever and makes us think back to the beginning of the film. It also may seem like a cop out in the very end but none the less, this is a great and entertaining thriller."

It's a little to long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the effects are at times a little cheesy and the Southern accents from Reeves and Charlize Theron who plays his wife aren't very good. But it is fun despite all that, and the set designs especially for the offices are great.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing, if just a little over the top and there are no standout performances though Charlize Theron is good despite he accent and Craig T Nelson turns in a decent performance in a minor role.

"TheGreatMarkukini","8","0","1","26 March 2019"," Do you job good and you just might earn a ticket to hell
","One quick look at the poster sets that chain of dominos off to the ""wish-to-watch"" button. Al Pacino luring with a charming smile, Keanu Reeves striking with a crispy-looking suit and Charlize Theron is as beautiful as always.<br/><br/>Moving directly to the sale of Keanu's skills by means of a ruthless trial we see the motion towards a high throne entangled in the turbid mist of doubt that corrodes whatever righteous principles one can have. The attitude shown within Kevin Lomax deserves a high praise considering that the character undergoes the unhuman seduction by the inventor of this word himself. The part of Charlize Theron cannot be put aside; she spices this trial to the point of sweet tortures of consciousness that do the opposite of what she had intended. These mind and body games go deep beyond the simple fraud, they show the hidden nature of a person on a single example of a suburban lawyer.<br/><br/>The other, magnificently breathtaking performance is standing out immediately and of course it is Al Pacino. Plainly saying this is just a role for which he was created. You look at the man and see that he could not only be a boss of a law firm but without any strain hold a faith of the world in his bare hands. The devilish subtlety that covers a sharp wit, aged appearance hiding the vigor of thousand men and the manner that cannot be rejected even by the holiest nun is a hallmark of Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Besides the plot twists and stunning acting, we get ingenious editing and directing. I was blown away by the use of light, especially the fireplace scenes depicted that infernal atmosphere so inherent to the residents of hell. The mystic flair was scattered a bit by the fleeting visual effects: one of them was enchantingly impressive but the others were like mosquito bites - unpleasant but tolerable.<br/><br/>The verdict is unanimous - the picture stands out and among all the suspense gives a valuable lesson in a way that astounds you."
"HotToastyRag","7","0","1","27 January 2019"," A total '90s classic
","The classic, commonly used phrase is given an entirely new meaning when lawyer Keanu Reeves joins an important law firm headed by the charming, persuasive Al Pacino. Things are simultaneously too good to be true and frighteningly ominous, and before long, we learn why: Al is Satan-or, as he says in his famous, hilarious monologue, ""Call me Dad.""<br/><br/>If you like these types of movies that border on horror, but aren't too scary for the faint of heart, this one's a classic. I only hid my eyes a couple of times, during Charlize Theron's demonic hallucinations, so everyone else out there should be fine. For a perfectly devilish Halloween marathon, rent both The Devil's Advocate and The Devil and Daniel Webster. Both are just scary enough so that you go to bed with the willies but aren't given nightmares, both star very handsome men playing the Devil, and Al Pacino cited Walter Huston's performance as his inspiration for the role. It just doesn't work when the Devil isn't played by a handsome, alluring man, does it? So, Al-and Walter, fifty-five years earlier-was perfectly cast. He's very magnetic and persuasive, so it's no wonder the weak-willed Keanu falls under his spell. The Devil's Advocate is so deliciously '90s. Check it out if you've somehow gone this long without seeing it."

I am so very impressed with this film for what it has to offer in meaning as well as entertainment value. Though one aspect in particular is a detractor to the authenticity and serious nature, it is undeniable that this film provides a unique opposition to what we all are taught to believe. <br/><br/>Rated R for a reason- watch this film for a date night flick, an entertainment powerhouse, or an opposing perspective to traditional religious teachings in an anti-hero way.

"lesleyharris30","7","0","1","3 April 2018"," Has a Lot of Great Ideas, Maybe Too Many,
","The Devil's Advocate is a good movie with a well developed plot and a very talented cast. The three stars, Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino and Charlize Theron are all spectacular in their role, shining seperately in different scenes and each overcoming very complicated arcs that they made look easy. The plot itself is immensely thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end in trying to figure out what exactly is going on. <br/><br/>I did, however, find that the film was overly ambitious in the many themes and elements it was trying to explore. Once we get deep in to the plot, it starts to feel overstuffed, trying to do too many things at once and falling flat in many areas as a result, wheras it would have been far more appealing had it focused on less, giving certain themes more attention, and thus making them richer. <br/><br/>The film is also far longer than it needs to be, this type of movie should not be any longer than two hours. I felt myself wanting it to end, and not because of a lack of intrigue or that I was bored, but because it was simply milking what it was trying to do for so long that it became increasingly less effective. <br/><br/>Truly unique. While it is certainly flawed, we can look past this when watching The Devil's Advocate and appreciate what it does right, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery.<br/><br/>
A lawyer based in Florida is given a massive opportunity to work for a firm in New York, but there's a catch. <br/><br/>
Best Performance: Al Pacino"
"TheMovieDiorama","7","0","1","25 February 2018"," Devil's Advocate blends courtroom drama with religious connotations.
","An interesting combination that evokes several themes. The problem is though, the two don't necessarily marinate well together constantly. A hot shot talented lawyer is unstoppable as he wins every case. A big cheese comes along and takes him under his wing which proves to be far more life altering than first anticipated. It's no spoiler, given the title and front cover, that this is about the power of evil. Vanity, power, lust, temptation...in fact, include all of the seven deadly sins as well. Depicting the idea that there is evil within everyone and that good does not necessarily always prevail. Our protagonist starts his new career with the best of intentions for him and his wife. He then starts to dabble into temptation and unknowingly evil creeps into his subconscious, tainting his view on love and life. Gradually becoming a marionette to a greater puppet master, which of course is perceived to be the Devil. I like the portrayal of how careers and relationships are built upon good, only for them to be maintained by evil. The narrative clearly shows this, the problem is the balance between the courtroom cases and the effects of the Devil's influence are skewed. They do not blend constantly. This becomes clear towards the end where the plot reveals a few twists. The religious connotations and subtext that follow are far too forced in a film that primarily focusses on law. Perhaps injecting the subtextual layers into the narrative more frequently would've given a better result and not such an underwhelming ending. Wasn't a huge fan of the final five minutes, hate it when films do that (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it). Surprisingly Keanu Reeves held his own against Al Pacino, and I thought Charlize Theron projected fragility really well in what is one of her earliest performances. It's a good drama, with many psychological concepts but unfortunately didn't explore the influence of evil to a greater extent."
"filimaua","8","0","1","22 October 2017"," A very well executed film with interesting ideas and themes.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film as an artistic view on the dark side of humanity. It explored themes of morality and temptation and free will. Keanu Reeves plays Kevin, a successful lawyer that's never lost a case that is offered a job at a powerful firm in New York, Charlize Theron plays his wife Mary Ann, and Al Pacino plays Kevin's boss and mentor who is revealed to actually be his father and Satan himself.<br/><br/>The more successful Kevin gets, the more he tends to end up abandon his wife. The film brings the idea that we are tempted by Satan to commit evil acts. But he doesn't control us and make us do these things, rather he tempts us with promises of whatever we desire, or whispers ideas into our heads and we do evil things in reaction and of our free will. Which I found to be a powerful message. The idea of the big, cold New York City being the ""devil's land"" or ""the city of Babylon"" was a nice touch.<br/><br/>People may have a problem with the nudity, but I was fine with it. It was an important part of the story. The female body and sex is shown to be another aspect of temptation.<br/><br/>So the whole point of the movie is, the devil exists and pushes humanity to do whatever we want for our own selfish desires, but at the end of the day what we do is all of free will. We have free will to give in to the temptations, just as we have the free will to resist and try and stay as morally good as we can.<br/><br/>My only problem with this film is Keanu Reeves. He was very good in this film, its just emotion was needed in a few scenes. Especially the death of his wife. He is crying and screaming as she dies in front of him, yet the very next scene he is walking down the hallway with his emotionless face and mono tone voice again. Dude, your wife just died. I would still be in a little moment of shock and sadness. I would just break down in tears a little here and there as it hits me over and over that my wife is dead, my voice would be in different tones. Nope, he is back into the usual emotion again, with barely any sadness under his monotone voice and facial expressions.<br/><br/>Other than that, Al Pacino is amazing, Charlize Theron is also good. A very good entertaining flick, with a dark atmosphere and a powerful message on the deep root of evil in humanity."
"generationofswine","7","0","1","1 July 2017"," An Honest Review
","OK, full disclosure, I have a thing for Al Pacino. I'll watch just about anything he's in and...if he screams and yells a monologue in it, if he delivers a diatribe of rage....yeah I get flashbacks to him screaming: ""I'd take a flame thrower to this place"" and roll my eyes back like a shark in a feeding frenzy.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, almost forgot, Keanu is in this one too...but for a good slice of the film he doesn't play the most savory of characters and, really, honestly, he just seems too nice to play a lawyer...<br/><br/>...but despite that he does a pretty good job of exhibiting the ego that has to come with the law profession...just not the vile evilness. So, I can't totally fault him for miscast as I could for Dracula.<br/><br/>Jeffery Jones is in there too and due to recent revelations he totally fits the sleazy lawyer role.<br/><br/>But yeah, 1997, the 90s had a way with films that was only really beaten by the 70s and The Devil's Advocate is one of those films that could really only be made in those two decades. Stand alone horror not intended as a franchise piece and one with a twist that asks you to think a little.<br/><br/>No way that would be made today and that is a shame.<br/><br/>I could tout its glory, but really, honestly, the movie could have stank and I wouldn't care thanks to Pacino screaming ""I'm a fan of man!"" It's worth the watch."

I didn't know this film was so... surreal.<br/><br/>I have to start with the good things about the film. The tension of the movie increases little by little in a very good way. I really enjoyed how everything kept becoming worse in every scene, and it climaxed in a very intense scene with Al Pacino and Keanu.<br/><br/>I also loved the ""dream scenes"" if you can call it that, or more appropriately hallucinations. Especially one of them, which portrayed the exact feelings of a character without having to say a word.<br/><br/>The special effects are OK for the time in which it was made. And the production design is really good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Al Pacino's performance although I could kind of notice that he was not taking this role very seriously and had some fun with it. Keanu Reeves does a fine performance with what he is given, which isn't much, and that is the main problem of the film.<br/><br/>I don't think the main characters and the secondary characters are really that interesting. I really didn't care a lot about the protagonist or his wife. I think the problem is that they show you how they react to certain stimuli but you don't understand why they reacted that way. The character ark is fine, but still, I have no reasons as to why the character changed.<br/><br/>I think that is my main problem with the film. The characters, and if you don't have interesting characters, you don't have an interesting movie.<br/><br/>Some other problems are that the story gets kind of over-the-top sometimes and not for the best. Also, I think some plot-lines could have been handled a little better.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you don't have to watch this film. But if you find yourself with nothing better to do, then you can rent it or watch it on TV and it will give you your money's worth."

After he does a man from a law firm in New York appears and offers him a deal to go there and assist them in selecting a jury for a specific trial. When the jury votes to acquit he is then invited to meet the man who owns the law firm who goes by the name of ""John Milton"" (Al Pacino). But just as Kevin Lomax is no ordinary lawyer, John Milton is no ordinary man--and he has a deal for Kevin that is extremely tempting. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was an exciting movie for the most part with good performances from Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron (as ""Mary Ann Lomax"") and Connie Nielsen (""Christabella Andreoli""). However, there were some parts which could have used some improvement along with the ending which seemed a bit too convenient in my opinion. Additionally, there was quite a bit of profanity and nudity which some viewers might need to know beforehand as well. Even so, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

","This movie is about a very successful Florida lawyer who hasn't lost a case since he started, played by Keanu Reeves, when he gets the chance to go work for a big lawyer company<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I expected something very different from what I got. It wasn't quite clear what the movie was going for. The scenes feel very rushed and most of them don't really serve a purpose. The first and the second part also felt very separate from each other. The first part felt more like a biopic, while the second part got glimpses of a psychological thriller. Only until the very (second to) last scene the movie revealed it's underlying message, but by then for me it was already ruined. <br/><br/>The performance felt a bit choppy for me, especially Keanu Reeves got on my nerves with some serious overacting. He also had something really irritating about his voice. Also Charlize Theron's character was just plain stupid, she had no personality whatsoever and you don't really care for their relationship. (It even annoys you a bit at times) The one bright spot in this whole movie is the performance of Al Pacino though. Every minute he's on screen he demands all the attention, and while you get from the beginning that he's not really very reliable, you do however enjoy every scene he's in because it really looks like Pacino is just having a fun time. Pacino has some great monologue moments in this moments, and all the credit goes to him because he didn't really have so much to work with, but somehow he made it click.<br/><br/>That's however the only really enjoyable part in the movie, because what's left is really just a hot mess. The editing feels very choppy and rushed, like already mention the dialogue is very dull and you don't really know where this movie is going or what it wants to be. It is blunt and too subtle at the same time. Sometime the movie wants to make something clear so bad that it just looks absolutely ridiculous while at other times you don't really get what the movie is trying to tell you. Having said that however, I do think if you see this movie twice, you Will get a bit more satisfaction over it if you do decide to concentrate on the underlying tone. It is pitiful however that you only can get grasp of the tone of the movie at the end of the movie. (The last monologue of Pacino is undoubtedly the thing that elevates this movie) I don't think anyone would really care to see it a second time to be honest, because you would have lost you attention for the movie long before the first watching even ends 5,5/10 verdict: A hot mess"

","I always remembered seeing the TV advertisements of the movie as a kid back in 1997 but I never actually sat to watch it until yesterday. Nice and interesting plot, top- notch actors performing well and a stunning Charlize Theron. However there were two things that were amazing in this movie and made me give it an 8 and not a 7. First the first totally unexpected jump scare scene in the dressing room. Even if you had the slightest idea about Al Pacino's true identity there was no way you were expecting this scare and that made it so unique and thrilling. The second thing was the ending. I do not always like ambiguous endings, especially when they are cheap and with no purpose, but the message of this one was truly thought-provoking. Vanity, oh vanity.."

","Self-reflexivity in artistic works serves to remind the audience that they are viewing a cultural product. It prevents their becoming so involved in the text that they do not think critically about the message. The presence of the mirror during various scenes of The Devil's Advocate serves as a self-reflexive device to highlight the major themes of the film, namely duality, free will and truth. These important mirror scenes propel the plot action to Kevin's ultimate downfall and rebirth.<br/><br/>The mirror first appears during the Gettys trial when Kevin is faced with a crossroads. He faces his reflection, and negotiates with himself in the mirror. The duality of seeing both him and his reflection highlights a struggle between good and evil. While Kevin sells his soul (ethic and morals) and makes his pact to keep his record clean, he does not wear his wedding ring. This recalls previous texts in which marriage is an institution frowned upon by the Devil. The sinking sound of the toilet flush and thunder with the rip of the paper towel further emphasize this crossroads scene. His decision to defend Gettys despite his knowledge highlights his pride. He is unwilling to lose a case and mar his unblemished record. The mirror sequence underscores his decision which propels the action forward, whereby Milton takes notice of him and lures him to New York.<br/><br/>When Kevin meets Milton, the two are reflected in a man-made lake on the rooftop. The body of water often symbolizes the unconscious and deep, submerged truths. This scene foreshadows the final climax when Milton reveals that he is Kevin's father and that he values man-kind above all else. At this mirror/reflection scene Milton asks ""you don't really want to go back to Florida, do you?"" and Kevin decides he does not. This decision, emphasized by the mirror, propels the action again by allowing Mary Anne and Kevin to move to New York despite his mother's warnings. This is another crossroads, a time when he could have resisted his egotism.<br/><br/>For Mary Anne, the mirror does not emphasize a crossroads, but truth. Milton looks at her over her shoulder at Eddie Barzoon's party, and the two are reflected in the mirror. It shows Mary Anne's desire to have someone standing there next to her. She is very lonely, and this scene is intercut with the first instance of Kevin bailing on her. He puts his work before her, leaving her alone.<br/><br/>While in the dressing room with her new friends, one woman admits she had a boob job while another worries about her hips. The two women stand in front of mirrors admiring themselves, but Mary Anne sees the true self and not the reflection. These self-absorbed women, spending money and drinking, are monsters. She sees one morph into a hideous creature, while the mirror in front of her emphasizes the deception of appearances. It is Mary Anne who realizes first why she is being punished. She values the money and the apartment too much. She was taken in by the appearance, but the reality is far different. The mirror emphasizes the duality.<br/><br/>At the hospital, Mary Anne refuses to look in the mirror because she thinks she will see a monster. She accepted blood money through Kevin's acquittals since she knew all those people were guilty. This emphasizes the mirror's ability to reveal true identity that later manifests with Pam. Evil had followed Mary Anne into her room in disguise, but the reflection revealed her true form. Mary Anne crashes the mirror at exactly the climax of Kevin's mother's story. Kevin had been running away and not listening to her, but after the incident he allows his mother to reveal that Milton is his father. The two scenes intercut emphasize the mirror as a teller of truth and discovering one's true identity. It is significant that Mary Anne kills herself with the mirror, because the truth hurts.<br/><br/>Another mirror scene occurs while Kevin and Milton are at the boxing match. While on the phone with Mary Anne, Kevin spies a woman wearing a red dress in front of a mirror. As he's looking, he tells Mary Anne not to wait up, that he does not know when he will be home. This decision that he makes, in light of the fact that Milton is his boss and pays for their apartment and bills, is intercut with Mary Anne's dream that her ovaries are removed. Kevin's decision propels the action by leading to her first hysterical moment when he will take her to a doctor. The woman in red symbolizes evil, and she is alone. Perhaps it suggests the isolation of Mary Anne on the other side of the phone to whom he is speaking while looking at another. The woman reflects on the blood color of her dress that Maryanne will soon see. The reflection foreshadows the reality.<br/><br/>In the final mirror scene, Milton dies and returns Kevin to the Gettys trial, in front of the mirror where it began. Kevin squints looking at his face, searching himself. His decision to kill himself propels the plot further and brings him back to himself. The cyclical nature of identity is further emphasized when Kevin abandons the trial, but relents to an interview when Larry calls him a star. Milton repeats that vanity is his favorite sin.<br/><br/>These various mirror scenes emphasize key themes in the film. Because the mirror scene in the Gettys case frames the film, it is obvious that there are two paths to take. History will repeat itself in a different way the next time around, but there is no escape from the self. Kevin faces himself and makes a decision to support the case, and the second time to drop it. Mary Anne makes a decision to kill herself. Their decisions embody the philosophy of free will, and have very real consequences propelling the story forward."

","Devil's Advocate (1997): Dir: Taylor Hackford / Cast: Al Pacino, Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron, Jeffrey Jones, Connie Nielsen: Graphic showcase regarding deceit starring Keanu Reeves playing a successful lawyer called to New York to continue his practice. Al Pacino is Satan in human form manipulating Reeves. Strange things occur especially when his wife claims to see demons. Timeline works against it improbably when a short recess occurs. Director Taylor Hackford handles surprise elements and backed with stunning visual effects but this is not even close to the affect achieved with Dolores Claiborne. Pacino is a terrific actor but as Satan he reels in a laughable performance. Reeves labors under cardboard material. Charlize Theron as Reeves's wife freaks out a lot but that could be the thought of starring in this film. Jeffrey Jones has a nasty jogging experience. Connie Nielsen also makes a wasted appearance in this hopeless demonic mess. Similar to Rosemary's Baby in structure but no where near as effective or believable. The one element that does work is its attitude towards Satan and how he deceives otherwise this is plainly just a graphic showcase. It does contain one effective well placed line where Reeves says to Satan, ""In the Bible we lose."" No more honest words than that.

","This film would have been much better without the introduction of the devil as a person and just concentrate in plain common human evil. Then the characters would've been more real and trustworthy and the film would've gain from it because then they would've had no specialization to be identified with. Like, Al Pacino has the role of the devil and acts like one as everyone is expecting, he is the devil and therefore he is evil, there is no surprise in that. But if he would've been a human being (an evil one), that would've been surprising and much more effective to the plot. And then the film would've jump up from horror to drama, a much better account from my point of view. It's a pity it was not like that, because otherwise the acting and directing was superb, but there is always the possibility of making a new film......"
"horrorflicklover","7","0","1","4 November 2014"," Solid film, CLOSE to what it should have been
","I liked this film more the first couple of times I saw it in my teen years. But watching it again later in life, I've knocked it down a few pegs. The thing is, it's almost a great horror-thriller film. It has an interesting plot which I think is cohesive, well-paced, and exciting, UP TO A POINT. And that point is: The Climax.<br/><br/>The climax of The Devil's Advocate successfully manages to halt a speeding train. Everything that this film built up to seems to be discarded as it awkwardly stumbles through a slow-moving, disengaging climax which serves to explain motive, but doesn't serve the rest of the film at all. This is somewhat repaired towards the end of the climax, as the film DOES indeed finish out nicely. But only after having pushed the audience away emotionally. There's too much uninteresting and useless dialog contained (as an attempt to build motive), and it gets straight goofy at a point where the antagonist turns from menacing evil to ""let's have a party"" supervillain. All-in-all, it totally muddles it, and leaves you waiting for it to become interesting again.<br/><br/>It's a shame, as I could rate this movie a couple of points higher had they simply managed to handle the climax better. Re-write it, shorten it, what have you. But it killed the thrill and suspense that it built up to.<br/><br/>Another flaw in this film is that you see that Keanu Reeves isn't a very good actor. He's OKAY to mediocre in this film. I would have hoped that a main character dealing with such volatile circumstance could have been portrayed by someone with better emotional range. Be it Reeves or someone else. He's not even consistent, really. One scene, he does well in showing anger and frustration. Then another comes along, and it's clear he's trying too hard NOT to be wooden.<br/><br/>The film has some saving graces, so that's not to say that it isn't worth a viewing. Al Pacino is a class act, and could carry this film all on his own. As I mentioned previously, I still think that the rest of the movie is well-done in regards to storyline, pacing, and execution. It builds up the characters well, especially Reeves character, of which we're given a glowing indication of his priorities. It's not really unpredictable, as this is a film where the ""twist"" is heavily implied in the advertising as it is. But you don't only watch a film to keep guessing, you watch it for HOW the story is made in to cinema. The Devil's Advocate ALMOST got to where it should have been going.<br/><br/>I give the film a 7, and perhaps that's being generous. I do have to admit that I enjoyed it, for the most part. But that climax really stopped me from giving it at least a couple of points higher. You may want to check it out, as it's not a blatant waste of 144 minutes. Just a waste of 20 or so."
"harryplinkett14","3","0","2","19 October 2014"," Not written by the Devil
","Pacino certainly is tough enough to be the Devil, and he can be as infernal as the script allows him to be. Unfortunately at the very climax the script falters and never delivers on the promise of a true word of wisdom from Satan himself.<br/><br/>Then again, what do we know? Maybe Satan has no words of wisdom and is in fact just a complete a-hole who causes pain without any apparent motive. Or perhaps we are too insignificant for him to bother explaining himself to us.<br/><br/>In any event, I expected more than the standard offer of endless power and pleasure, for the purpose of pissing off God. Then again, as soon as I saw Keanu Reeves as the protagonist, I kind of figured things would not get too intellectual.<br/><br/>Speaking of Keanu, that man possibly has a more limited acting range than Steven Seagal. Throughout the film he shifts between an expressionless face and an irritated one. That's about it. He plays either nondescript or upset. When he has arguments with his wife, all he does is get annoyed and angry. The man simply does not act. So why is he in the film? Indeed, one has to wonder what they were thinking regarding his character. If we are supposed to empathise with him in order to be worried about what will happen to him, he has to be likable. But the is not likable at all. The only thing I cared about was watching crazy Pacino do what he does best and be an outrageous, charismatic character that steals every scene regardless of how it is written.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, there is little in terms of genuine emotional investment. The only emotion I felt was frustration.<br/><br/>One final remark: You don't need to make the Devil too smart, but make him scary. The scariest thing this Devil did was make some homeless people beat a guy to death in a scene that had little to offer in terms of suspense or fear. How about a Satan with a really nasty bite?"

","Something about this film was too realistic. Al Pachino was sooo bad. Lucifer is so real that it's not acting. it is what it is. It felt like he was sitting on the end of my bed every time he appeared. Most horror films are designed for the viewer to watch from afar. You might feel like you are in the film and get the scares but not that the demons are trying to touch you personally. Lucifer and the demon women are directed towards the audience much of the time. It's like he is trying to show you personally how he wants to take Keanu while he is doing sex with you. I expected a bit more distance. The Godfather was an angel compared to this."
"pinturicchio_juve","5","0","3","11 May 2013"," Doesn't really live up to its hype
","This was one film I had been wanting to watch for quite some time now, and I got around to it just a while back. I had some really good expectations from this movie, as I had read about it on IMDb and other movie sites, and I had thought it would be a courtroom thriller filled with suspense.<br/><br/>But I have to say I was a bit disappointed with what I saw. The film is about a hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) who has never lost a case in his entire career. A New York law firm enlists his help to select a jury for a case and recognizing his talent, offers him a job. Lomax accepts and becomes quite close to his boss, John Milton (Al Pacino) during the course of his work. But he gradually begins to uncover some strange facets of Milton's personality and finally realizes that he is none other than Satan himself.<br/><br/>Now, such a premise should surely set the stage for a riveting thriller filled with suspense and mystery. But sadly, it doesn't. I think the main reason is Keanu Reeves' performance. I couldn't really buy the idea of him being an argumentative lawyer who could acquit a rapist in spite of the pile of evidence staring him in the face, especially as this is what is shown in the first scene of the film. If the scene is supposed to convince the viewer of the talent of this young lawyer, it doesn't really pass the test. The only thing it does is invariably draw comparisons to the courtroom scenes in ""A Few good Men"", which had fabulous dialogues, coupled with one of Tom Cruise's finest performances ever. So it is asking a lot to make the audience believe that Lomax hasn't yet lost a case.<br/><br/>Apart from this, the film does have a few things going for it. The pace is fast and well set, and for a first time viewing, there is no scene which makes you feel bored, irksome or irritable. And, of course, there's Al Pacino. His thunderous voice and arrogant demeanour are enough to make the viewer feel uncomfortable about him, and it isn't really hard to associate his character with that of the Devil. <br/><br/>The other characters merely serve as pretexts for Lomax's wife to lose control over herself and imagine things related to hell, Satan and all that stuff. <br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a must-see, but probably something you might just rent at a DVD store when your other choices aren't that appealing."

"son_of_cheese_messiah","3","0","5","28 November 2012"," The devil has a son...called Kevin
","This film is truly an oddity. There's the usual series of gruesome deaths lifted from The Omen and many another supernatural yarn accompanied by the now standard choral music. There's nothing much in the way of originality about any of this, but it does at least hold the attention. <br/><br/>The most interesting thing are the bravura speeches from the villain John Milton (AKA The Devil) delivered with great gusto by Al Pacino, but some of the gravitas is undermined by his son's rather bathetic name 'Kevin'. 'Beelzebub and Kevin' does not quite have a demonic ring to it.<br/><br/>The formulaic script is written more for melodramatic impact than sense, with people wandering onto busy roads for no apparent reason only to be mowed down by cars and such like. One strange and inexplicable scene has a blood drenched Kevin after just seeing his wife die by slitting her own throat meet his mother. Rather than her saying ""why are you covered in blood, Kevin?"" or ""My God! what happened to my daughter-in-law?"" instead she launches into a longwinded exposition (but one telegraphed at least an hour earlier in the film) that Milton is his father. <br/><br/>All this is gory and faintly ludicrous but is carried out with Hollywood slickness and would perhaps deserve a better score were it not for the unforgivable finale where this house of cards collapses.<br/><br/>Kevin is tempted to join his satanic father by having sex with his own sister. Instead of this Kevin chooses to shoot himself at which point any sense the script had disappears. Kevin's sister for some unexplained reason dies. The devil's (and the emperor's new) clothes fall off, he starts to burn while shouting ""No! No!"" The only way this comically bad scene could have been improved would have been to have Pacino say, <br/><br/>""HE'S NOT THE ANTICHRIST! HE'S A VERY NAUGHTY BOY!""<br/><br/>All this makes little sense dramatically or theologically. How can you defeat the devil by committing suicide? Isn't that expressly forbidden in the scriptures? <br/><br/>Still you could argue that the point is that Kevin makes an act of self-sacrifice and had it ended there it perhaps would not have been so bad. <br/><br/>BUT THEN HE WAKES UP! <br/><br/>Seriously, he is then back at the very start of the film before any of the bad stuff happened. In other words the whole thing was an extended dream sequence. This is the sort of thing that first year English students are told to avoid.<br/><br/>To cap it all Kevin then refuses to defend his client, something than is strangely presented as a moral stance when it is actually morally and legally dubious. Isn't it a lawyer's duty to defend his client even if he knows his client is guilty?<br/><br/>A pointless re-appearance of Al Pacino right at the end just adds to the incoherence."

","If you have seen the trailer or any promotional material for this film you will generally know the rough story of it. I won't tell you the in depth story of the film but I will tell you the story before it is actually all revealed, the trailer gives far too much away of the final act which breaks the surprise of the conclusion.<br/><br/>The film starts with Kevin Lomax (Reeves) defending a paedophile school teacher who is clearly guilty. Lomax manages to win the case and it is then revealed that he has won every case he has fought in. After winning this latest one, he heads out to celebrate with his wife Mary-Anne (Theron) where he is approached with an offer from a firm in New York who want his help picking a jury. Due to the financial gain, Lomax and his wife take the plunge and move to New York, where Lomax's great work in picking a jury see him lead the line defending a possible triple homicide case and moving into a top end fifth avenue apartment. This is a man at the pinnacle of his career, with a gorgeous wife and now a glorious apartment in one of the most attractive cities in the world. What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>As Lomax begins to grow into his new job, and work under the supervision of his new boss John Milton (Pacino) things do take a turn for the worse. Mary-Anne begins to feel lonely and craves the baby that could make her life complete, however Kevin's concentration remains on his job. This forces Mary-Anne to socialise with the other lawyer's wives and partners. One day when they are out shopping, Mary-Anne begins to hallucinate and the wives begin to turn into demonic figures. She decides to lock herself in her apartment, where things start to become much worse for her in the hallucination stakes, as well as in the neglect from her preoccupied husband. On the side of his concentration on his job, Kevin begins an infatuation with a co-worker, who he envisions whilst having sex with his wife. His neglect doesn't go unnoticed by Mary-Anne and she slowly begins to free fall into possible schizophrenia, with her ending up in a metal hospital. Has Kevin let his life spiral out of control due to his job, his new boss, or himself?<br/><br/>The film is very clever, even if it does become a little supernatural at the end. The courtroom set up works really well, and the fact that the 'demons' belong amongst lawyers seems to be sending out a hidden message. The story here has been developed well and the writing is top drawer. There are many twists and turns in the film, and I'm sure many of you are aware of the outcome, that slowly bring the story to its final conclusion. At several points throughout it is hinted towards what is going on, and the only person that doesn't see it is Kevin. You will find out when you watch it why that is though. Everything pulls together well and it is a real intriguing watch.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is fantastic as John Milton, and when you hit the conclusion you will understand how brilliantly he portrays his character. The cinematography also aids in his character with many red lights and dark shadows really highlighting him, as well as Pacino's devilish smile. Theron is also great as the psychologically frail wife. Her emotional ride is clearly visible as the film goes on and she also shines in possibly the most horrific scene in the film, one that forced my jaw to the floor and my hand over my mouth. It was shocking. Keanu Reeves on the other hand plays Keanu Reeves. At times his portrayal works, especially in the final half of the film, however his accent becomes more of an annoyance and his delivery of his line make his performance even more wooden. Another actor may have done the character more justice, but Reeves is known for acting like that. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is very slow, and it isn't until about half way through that it really starts to kick in. The hallucinations at times are freaky and it is at this point where you really will become hooked. The story is intriguing and is thoroughly enjoyable considering it is a slight courtroom drama. The twist of the film may not be a surprise, but it does hit you hard and it makes much of the film make more sense. The tension is high throughout the long running time and it had me gripped from start to finish. I do think the final climax could have been cut slightly though, and it does slowly border on farce, but the director holds it together and has produced a film full of tension, and with several biblical themes that refer to many of us.<br/><br/>3.5 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

Nelson as their newest high-profile client, Alexander Cullen, to be tried for murdering his own family members.<br/><br/>This is a dark thriller, somewhat scary at times, with satanic undertones.

You see, Kevin is actually Milton's son, born of a strange visit his mother made years ago to NYC. That is why he also has the power to know how to pick jurors. Caught in a very tight spot, in Milton's lair, Kevin chooses to shoot himself in the head, his dying caused Milton and his half-sister Christabella to die, then Kevin was able to ""wake up"" to his prior existence, now rid of the dEVIL and all that came with it."

","Kevin Lomax, a ruthless young Florida attorney that never lost a case, is recruited by the most powerful law firm in the world.

","I love this movie. I like the fact that its not preachy, its not a morality tale, and its not one of those annoying ""god vs. the devil"" type of movies. Its basically about the devil and his perspective. I love Al Pacino as the wicked devil and Keanu actually acts well in this movie. I especially loved the ending. Its a damn good movie.<br/><br/>I'm sure not everyone will love it but I definitely do. I don't think every movie needs to end with a morality tale, I think its great that the movie had fun with the myth of Satan.

","I wish 'Devils Advocate' went further and touched on Wall Street as well.<br/><br/>I hate clichés. I hate when Hollywood takes a story that everyone has known since they were old enough to use the toilet and people think it's utterly amazing. As far as horror movies go, that includes everything from Disturbia to Sweeney Todd. I am shockedREALLY shocked to say that list does not include Devil's Advocate.<br/><br/>Yes, you've heard the story before. (Well, as far as this movie goes, that is. Who knows what the final plot will end up being.) But when it comes to this movie, really, who cares? The only thing I can compare the way this movie made me feel to was the original Alien. The characters were as realistic as really being at a real party. The camera just simply adds yet another added layer of realism. The plot was realistic, as I would have done nothing different than the main characters. I never once would have thought I would be writing the word ""Hollywood"" and ""realism"" anywhere near the same sen"
"johnnyboyz","6","0","2","3 November 2008"," An interesting case of genre hybridity but Reeves' lead and some generally jumbled scenes cannot hold the film together too greatly.
","Who would've thought the merging of the horror genre with the legal thriller would actually threaten to half work? That's exactly the feeling that eerily dawns on you about half way to two thirds of the way through The Devil's Advocate, a film that uses whatever few scares and un-canniness it carries at the best of times to disorientate and make the viewer uneasy  less is very much more in this film and it works well on an emotional level. The scenes I'm referring to of course are when a certain Mary Ann Lomax (Theron) catches a glimpse of what a couple of high price law firm employees actually are, and that is pure evil in the from of a stick thin but pretty none-the-less female masquerading. They are scenes that zone the viewer out of the legal thriller genre and into a different, unexpected realm; a realm of horror.<br/><br/>But these scenes are few and far in-between and are moulded around a lead named Kevin Lomax, Mary Ann's husband, played by Keanu Reeves. The annoying bit about this is that Reeves cannot quite carry the film on his own and does not possess the necessary acting qualities required to drive the bizarre, hybrid beast that is The Devil's Advocate thus rendering it an ordinary and somewhat bland story about a possible apocalypse when it could've been an interesting and, dare I say, groundbreaking film that people might have still been talking about today for reasons other than the fact Pacino, Reeves and Theron are in it.<br/><br/>But some of this is down to the telling of the story and a slice of the direction. There is no obvious structure to the film, which isn't a bad thing, but the repetition of the establishing of the new world Kevin inhabits when he arrives in the 'big city' from his rural, old fashioned dwellings drag on a bit and the film takes a while in getting to the meat that will make up the film, that being a murder trial whose suspect is supposedly innocent and guess what; Kevin is put on the job. The Devil's Advocate's priorities seem to be in the right places. The film is a fish out of water story at the be all and end all of it, but it establishes Kevin as a man with a slight religious persona, something that the film utilises when it comes to dealing with the evil that certain other characters possess later on. This makes for good 'jump' scenes or moments in which the character we map onto gets a good freight, as do we. Kevin's slight religious background acts as a catalyst for certain 'feelings' and sensations he gets later on and they work relatively well, cinematically.<br/><br/>The film sees Kevin leave his Florida roots with his wife Mary-Ann for New York City. If ever there was a place in America to set a film about a newcomer or a 'fish out of water' arriving in new territory then it's New York. His new boss is John Milton, Al Pacino in a 'rant role', but it's all a façade for greater things. Milton is an odd individual but Pacino plays him perfectly. He's egotistical and outgoing, exclaiming things at the top of his voice with the sort of confidence that suggests he's been everywhere and done everything and anything he says is probably dead right anyway.<br/><br/>So in this male dominated world of lawyers and suit wearing business officials that inhabit courtrooms and offices, what of the women and Kevin's other half in particular? It's interesting to note that Mary-Ann exists to be a ditzy and somewhat stupid blonde woman who we begin disliking through annoyance but gradually come to feel sorry for as events play out. On the other hand, the mysterious female associates to Milton and his company exist to go shopping and get their breasts out. But this underestimates the film because underneath there is a fair amount of seduction and evil going on between the women. Women have never got a fair crack in either the legal thriller genre nor indeed the horror genre so for them to undergo (in Mary-Ann's case) the psychological horrors and changes they do is impressive in a certain sense.<br/><br/>But again, acting pulls the film down. Charlize Theron sees fit to shriek a lot and act in a very odd manner as the psychological study sets in  she is one fish not enjoying her time out of the water and it tells much later on. But then the shrieking and the eccentric behaviour when not a lot has really happened to drive her that way takes over. Was it the obsession in choosing a certain paint colour? Loneliness? Has all the shopping worn her out and forced her to hallucinate? It all sounds, and feels, a little messy. The bulk of the film is Pacino and Reeves swanning around business parties, interacting with pretty women in expensive suites. Kevin resists certain sins such as lust and greed as his journey goes on but has a few tiffs with his wife along the way. While the film isn't spectacular in any sense and the ending is disappointing, the film retains an interest and its hook of combining the two genres it does acts as a nice anchor throughout but the acting and general content of real note feels out of sorts rendering the film a pretty good exercise but nothing particularly memorable in the long run."

","Too bad that Keanu reeves has been chosen for this magnificent film. Thanks to that, this film by times feels like watching 'SPEED' or 'The Matrix' for he presents his character in the same way he does the others. I wouldn't call it bad acting, but he shouldn't keep on doing it because new challenges will only make it more obvious that he reached his limit. Especially when the other members of the cast put down a performance like they did in 'The Devil's Advocate'. They on the other hand make up for the uncreative acting performance of their colleague, making this film one worth to watch! Good story, great monologues, nice effects and good acting performances of most of the cast. One does not even have to be religious to agree with what this film brings. Proved by great literature in history, Vanity can be fruitful... as a subject."

","The Devil's Advocate was one of those films that I didn't really have high expectations. Little did I know that it was to be one of my favourite films of all time and a must own on DVD. <br/><br/>The Devil's Advocate has a terrific story line of mans seduction to wealth and success. The great theme of how the simple life is better when it comes to moral values, and how mans greed and lust for money, brings chaos.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is without a doubt, my favourite actor ever and this role of Satan/John MIlton (arguably his best role since Tony Montana), brings more depth to Pacino's sometimes-typical roles of gangsters and cops. <br/><br/>Al Pacino, and the gorgeous, extremely lovable and very talented Charlize Theron bring a lot to The Devil's advocate. Pacino's character has some magnificent dialogue; when Pacino talks about love, ""Overrated. Biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate"". Absolute genius. Pacino's character is also, in my opinion very profound. With quotes such as ""I'm here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began. I've nurtured every sensation man's been inspired to have. I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him. Why? Because I never rejected him, in spite of all his imperfections. I'm a fan of man. I'm a humanist. Maybe the last humanist"". Absolutely classic.<br/><br/>The only problems I had with The Devil's advocate were it's ending and Keanu Reeves. Don't get me wrong the happy ending was OK, but I think I would have preferred the clichéd ending of Reeves blowing his brains out. Honestly I think that Keanu Reeves can be forgettable in all of his films (except for Bill and Ted), especially when he is along side the best acting abilities that Theron and Pacino's offer. Basically, an actor, who possibly plays a slightly more convincing part, could definitely replace Reeves' UN-exciting persona. Generally, Reeves doesn't convey the southern accent and doesn't convince as the role of attorney Kevin Lomax.<br/><br/>Overall The Devil's Advocate is a multi-genre film that is witty, scary and quite romantic. This film has everything to offer film lovers from the ages of late teens and up; definitely not to be missed. 9/10"

","Keanu Reeves is a defense attorney from Gainesville, FL who is recruited by a NY law firm whose head honcho just happens to be Satan. Striking concept - and a surprisingly striking story is what follows. This is a perfectly cast movie - even with Reeves. What isn't needed here is Reeve's ""southern"" accent. He's from Florida. That doesn't mean he has to have an accent. Hell, most of the people who live in Florida are from NY anyway. Pacino is perfect as an intriguing man who has it all - along with a guiltless conscious. Who wouldn't want that? Lomax does, and if he doesn't right away, Milton will make sure he does by the end. Theron is superb as Lomax's wife who goes along for the ride due to her loyalty to her broodingly successful husband.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work is subtle way in which John Milton is revealed as Satan, and just what in the world does he actually want Kevin Lomax for anyway? This movie would've worked just as well if the audience didn't know this fact going into the movie. It could've pulled off a ""Sixth Sense"" if wanted to. Nevertheless, the film keeps the audience glued to the screen in anticipation of what's going to happen next. We see Lomax's world caving in around him, and the only one who is oblivious to that fact is him. It is believable because if any one of us put ourself in his position - a top notch young lawyer with an unblemished win/loss record on the verge of his career breaking wide open depending on the outcome of his current high profile case - his first under Milton's firm, we would all act the same way. We would all be oblivious to the same signs he continues to miss - his wife's crumbling sanity, his mother's warnings, his subconscious awareness that his clients are guilty as sin.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a story that is told right. Sometimes our greatest villain isn't as obvious as the back of our hand."

The weak person (Reeves) gets a feeling that he is the one who pulls the strings, but everything has been decided already.<br/><br/>So, on the one hand it is: (trying to quote Matrix) ""I only show you the door, you are the one who goes though"" on the other hand it is: ""Would you drop the vase if I did not tell you about it?"".

","""The Devil's Advocate"" explores and expands upon themes introduced to moviegoers in ""The Firm"", but with a mythical overlay. (I realize both films are based on books, but the analogy still works.) <br/><br/>""The Devil's Advocate"" doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, as the harsh themes could have mired it down completely.<br/><br/>The director didn't quite trust our ability to understand some of the point plots without bludgeoning us over the head with them, but sometimes that can be forgiven.  <br/><br/>Acting in The Devil's Advocate is uneven and at times, gloriously over the top. Keanu Reeves, I am coming to realize, is cursed with a face too placidly built to express emotions convincingly. The scene where he is crying out while holding his wife illustrates what I mean. While his anguished voice and actions are muted by the lack of plasticity in his face, his pain is evident. I think his best bit of acting comes from the scene where he has alternating bodies under his thrusting loins. In those moments his face is more expressive than I can ever recall seeing it, and he seems more ""real"" than he has since ""Bill and Ted"". (The only film I ever recall him looking really happy in.)<br/><br/>Ms Theron, as usual, told volumes with each nuanced glance, and Al Pacino is delicious as the modern era devil, one of the last roles before he started phoning it in with recycled personas. (The Insider, Simone, The Recruit) Naming his character ""John Milton"" is splendid irony. I get a big kick out of the look on his face as he threatens to plunge a finger in the basin of consecrated water. The devil as mischievous school-boy, reminding us of why he ""fell"" in the first place.<br/><br/>The nudity, while a bit too much for my tastes, was curiously more sensual than sexual, and the near ending brought to mind the ""Bobby in the shower scene"" from Dallas...<br/><br/>If you believe in the devil, this film can be disturbing. If you don't, it can be an interesting romp on the darker side. Take it at the value the director assigned it and you can be entertained for a few hours."

The great shocking end also made me to think about vanity in the way that they say it .whenever you become proud of yourself you will make a new devil born. so go and watch it 2 times then you will be another person and your outlook toward life will change .

","Taylor Hackford directs this big budget morality tale with the sure hand of a storyteller.  Keanue Reeves is a much better actor than people give him credit for.  If you watch most of his performances carefully, he is creating spaces for the other actors to work in.  That is a sure sign of talent. It's a shame most people are quick to jump on the ""I hate Keanu"" bandwagon, perhaps it is jealousy.  Anyway, Keanu plays a hotshot Florida lawyer who never loses a defense case - as it turns out, there was a hole in the wall between the mens room and the jury deliberation room.  That means he knew he was getting his clients, who we can only assume to be guilty-as-heck dirtbags if we are to go by the films opening sequence, off on charges he knew they were guilty for.  That makes him the titled ""Devils Advocate"" because advocate literally means ""to plead in favor of"".  He was pleading in favor of men he knew were evil, in essence, this makes him evil too.  The entire film is revealed to be a morality struggle going on inside the head of his character... can he look himself in the mirror when he knows deep inside of himself the consequences of what he is about to do?

","This is a frustrating movie, in my opinion. You can tell that it has potential of being a truly great movie; the basic theme, several plot twists, the casting and the costumes and sets all point in direction of a ""classic"".<br/><br/>But I think it falls short, and it does so because of a few flaws that needn't have been there. I've read praise of Al Pacino's performance in earlier comments, but I think it's one of the major problems. He's given completely free reins, and in fact must have been encouraged to go all out. And so he does, with obvious pleasure. The end result is overblown, overstated, crude, lacking in nuance. He laughs like the devil and smiles like the devil... over and over... adding nothing to the character after the initial impression. There is no growth in Milton's character, or in Pacino's handling of it.<br/><br/>This is the second problem - the Milton part is badly written. It contains long, literary and completely artificial monologues on the state of the world, that doesn't work at all on the screen. No person, not even the devil, talks like that. You lose interest, because the basic direction of the monologue is clear from the beginning, even though it goes on for another 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Putting these two problems together and I think that you have a bit of a turkey inside an otherwise very interesting movie.<br/><br/>Of course, Pacino is great in the movie when he works with small gestures, and the Milton part is sometimes intriguing -- a fine example of the RIGHT combination of the two is in the subway scene with the two hispanic hoodlums. I wish there would have been more of that and less loud, maniac monologues. Oh, and that false teeth prosthetic looks really strange on Pacino... in some scenes he looks like a real doofus. Weird.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves was very good (as he sometimes is), as is Charlize Theron. The movie has lots of clever ideas and memorable scenes. It's also pretty unpleasant. I like the triple ending, though I can see how people may feel ripped off.<br/><br/>Could have been truly great. Too bad. I gave it a 7 / 10."

Those dark eyes, the husky voice, the slow tone. He was made for this part. By the end of this film I was convinced that the Lord must have created Pacino in the image of the Dark Prince. Devil's Advocate could so easily have been more than just this however if it were not for the unnecessary complication of Al Pacino being Keanu Reeves's father. Without this the atmosphere is dark, hot and basically hellish. The shots of the ghoulish faces are truly jumpy and you are constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for the next one to pop out of somebody's head. Connie Nielson is excellent as the devil's daughter and is another truly disturbing character.<br/><br/>Overall the story does seem to work even if it is a little far-fetched. Remember it is only a vehicle to showcase the spectacular atmosphere and sets on this film - Pacino's rooftop office balcony looks awesome. In this it succeeds.

The end of the movie is an absurdity, with the redoubtable Mr.Reeves committing the one unforgivable sin to save mankind from domination by the beast, or in this case, by an extremely confused fallen angel. Why does satan chant in latin as he presides over the impending culmination of his devious plan? Is Latin a native language in the netherworld? Lomax's bible-thumping mother had intimate relations with the devil in her youth, because he was a real 'good listener'? You can only tell if beings are demons by looking at them in mirrors?

Then comes the devily proposal...

The plot does not surprise you, the intended surprises seemed  the work of an amateur writer, who thinks the best shocks come from those things that are supposed to surprise you (wow, the man is his father, wow, that´s his sister, wow, his wife did that, and he did that...). It happens that, nowadays, movie fans do see  a lot of movies, from many years, from many directors, and it takes a good plot and good directing to really surprise them.<br/><br/>  I foresaw some events quite a few minutes before I was shown them.

You know it is Florida as everyone wears white suits, sweats and cools themselves with those little fans they give out at funerals.  Kevin's preacher mum has been thumping the bible so hard that she has knocked her brains out.

When Kevin receives an offer he can't refuse from a senior partner in a New York law firm, John Milton (Al Pacino) who is the devil in disguise, he jumps at the opportunity to become a hot shot lawyer and get fabulously rich, no matter what the cost.  And here lies the core of the film.  Milton offers him the world if he will sell his own soul.  Kevin is never pushed or threatened, the choice is his alone to make. He jumps into the shallow world of high-living movers and shakers who are rotten to the core, and literally hell bent on success, his wife goes insane and commits suicide, and his mother reveals that Milton is his father.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Kevin wakes up to what is going on and in a superb long debate with the devil argues the case for responsibility for his slide down the slippery slope before choosing salvation.   <br/><br/>The film is a joy to watch, especially if you like to concentrate on what they are saying rather than just watching the action.  Al Pacino goes way over the top and gets away with it.  The only other actor I can think of who could have played this role successfully over the top is Albert Finney.

Instead, for much of the movie we see an insufferable hothead who will stop at nothing to win his cases, even at the expense of the relationship with his wife.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to further exactly how evil Al Pacino is, through various scenes of grisly murder and implied sexual encounters. However, the violence comes across as excessive and the sexuality is best represented by a truly gratuitous nude scene involving Charlize Theron. All this is heaped on to make John Milton look like an evil force, but succeeds only in making stomachs churn. It also dilutes any potential moral message that the screenplay tries to convey in shallow, mind-numbing acts of cruelty.<br/><br/>While the Devil's Advocate seems to tug at the moral fabric that binds humanity, it sacrifices any redeeming content to its audience through overly extreme uses of graphic adult themes.

Of course, the many beautiful women of the movie are a strong factor of getting a man's attention..."

","After seeing Al Pacino in this movie, I truly understood the meaning of screen presence. He towers above any of his screen partners in this modern fable of the oldest evil.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is a small town attorney driven by his own vanity and ambition, and his social climbing wife (Charlize Theron playing what I think was a fairly unsympathetic character) to accept a position with a high-powered New York law firm. Pacino is the senior partner. Oh, by the way, he's also the devil. He becomes Reeves' mentor, for reasons which become clear at the end of the film.<br/><br/>This is a magnificently mounted and photographed film marred only by Reeves' wooden performance (I think he's a cool actor, but I didn't think the role suited him) and the Theron as the really irritating wife.

Rosemary's Baby is about paranoia. All through the film, we are not sure whether Mia Farrow's suspicions are correct or whether she is just suffering from a pregnancy-related illness, as her doctor suggests. What makes this film work is this uncertainty and unease.<br/><br/>The Devil's advocate is about vanity. Keanu Reeve's ultimate destruction is brought about because he of this weakness in his character. In RB, we never get the sense that Mia's involvement in the Satanic cult is in anyway related to a sin or vice. DA is clearly about one man's fatal flaw.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that The Devil's Advocate is a great film. It is watchable and fairly scary. But I don't think it is fair to call it a copy of RB."

","What do Al Pacino, Charlise Theron, and Keanu Reeves all have in common? Not acting school, that's for sure.  If you don't believe me (and I know you do), go and see ""The Devil's Advocate.""<br/><br/>Reeves plays Kevin, a money-hungry lawyer whose winning streak and ability to defend low-lifes attracts the attention of big-time New York City lawyer John Milton (yes, like the `Paradise Lost' poet).  Milton (Al Pacino) gives Kevin a NYC apartment, a huge salary, parties, and a brand new high profile murder case.  Pretty soon things start getting weird.  Kevin's wife, Marianne (Theron), starts seeing things and becomes convinced Kevin's new colleagues are demons - is she crazy, or is she right?  Dum-dum-dum-dumm! [dramatic chord]  Along the way there are lots of jury selection scenes, paper-shredding scenes, lesbian insinuation scenes, and scenes where Al Pacino raises his voice.  Dum-dum-dum-dumm! [another dramatic chord]  And Keanu?  Well, he pretty much stays the same. [no dramatic chord]<br/><br/>The thing is, it wouldn't be that bad if Keanu kept his voice low, whispering lawyer phrases like `Objection, your honor,' in a sultry, growling voice.  That way I wouldn't have to hear him *try* to be southern, because he's clearly not.  One semi-twangy word every couple of lines ain't quite like having your car horn beep `Dixie' as you drive through Hazzard County.<br/><br/>But to be fair, I think he felt the need to keep up with Al Pacino, whose acting secret has finally been revealed: the yell.  Yes, Mr. Pacino-we don't care if you're robbing a bank, joining the family business, doing the tango blind on the dance floor or tackling the tobacco industry  just go ahead and yell.  `Hoo-wah!'  And now that you've been cast as Satan, what better opportunity will you ever have to yell more than this?  But, if you're not going to yell, for instance during the high-class party scenes or the lesbian insinuation scenes, when yelling would simply be inappropriate, then just grin, throw your head back, and let out one of those word-famous guffaws.  `Hah!'  Oh, how we love Al's guffaws.<br/><br/>The most entertaining part comes when Keanu and Al clash at the climax. Here is one of the best actors in the world and one of the worst actors in the world, and they're just yelling at each other.  After a while I didn't even care what was going on anymore, because all the essential secrets of the film were somehow revealed right before the yelling part, so for me it just seemed like an excuse for both of them to scream.<br/><br/>""My God, you're a bad actor!""<br/><br/>""Whoa!""<br/><br/>Charlise Theron wins the `Lawyer-wife-who-slowly-goes-insane-throughout-the-course-of-the-film' award.  Craig T. Nelson wins the `Why-are-you-in-this?' award, simply because that's what I kept wondering.  Jeffrey Jones (one of the most underrated actors of our time) gets the award for `Best-portrayal-of-a-central-park-mugging-victim' and Pacino wins for `Best-capped-teeth,' and also the `Most-outrageous-way-of-setting-holy-water-on-fire' award.<br/><br/>All in all, it's hard to tell what this film's message is-all lawyers are inherently evil and the spawn of Satan, or is this a clever analogy meant to question our own ethics and morals?

The last scene of the movie, without which the film would not be nearly as good, makes this point by showing that even if Kevin escapes the temptation to win the case by turning away from his guilty client, he still gives in to vanity when he agrees to have his story written.  The devil can get to Kevin any way he wants; he just has to appeal to his self-love and vanity.<br/><br/>The film is unique and powerful.  I especially liked the scene in which Al Pacino talks about how God is a sadist while the Devil nurtures every human emotion and never condemns people.  You don't have to be anti-God or a devil worshiper to understand the point that he is making, and it is very interesting and philosophical.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film and highly recommend it.

","WARNING: SPOILERS CONTAINED<br/><br/>
However, this film can be either an inventive, experimental masterpiece or a piece of rubbish, I must admit.<br/><br/>With different spices added to this flick, Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a promising defending attorney, his wife (Charlize Theron) and his new employer (Al Pacino), are the central characters. A little bit of horror, suspense, fantasy, lust, and incest mixed up. Graphic scenes, especially the naked women. <br/><br/>No matter how surreal the plot is, I now consider it a tale which has something to say. It's so much fun to watch Lomax, being a hotshot advocate, has eventually realised that he can't get them both - conscience and success. Or I should say, vanity.<br/><br/>So what is John Milton (Al Pacino) anyway? It's good that we don't get a clear answer from the movie. We do know that he possesses black magic, and maybe something even more powerful. Charlize Theron's performance is splendid. <br/><br/>And then, the evil is displayed throughout the movie as intriguing force (intriguing, indeed). After Lomax breaks the spell by exercising his individual free will, he gets a second chance to have his life and to make a different decision. Unfortunately, the very ending is rather weak. Nevertheless, I think you can learn something from it.<br/><br/>'Vanity is my favourite sin', says Milton. He says it more than once. Maybe that's the whole point. I find 'The Devil's Advocate' profound...philosophical, in a way you wouldn't notice it so easily. I also enjoy the madness, the bloodiness and the sense of 'seeking your success, and succumbing into your own ego and - vanity'. All these fascinating elements are put together beautifully by director Taylor Hackford."

","This is one of my favorite movies of the 90s.  Creepy and freaky in a subtle way, there were no monsters to jump out at you, no guys with chainsaws or goalie masks, and no razor-sharp fingers.  The devil didn't spew fire and brimstone on the innocent, he instead very skillfully used temptation to bring out the evil in people until it destroyed them and their loved ones. It shows that the true horror is the evil that lurks inside oneself, and the consequences of that evil going unchecked.  <br/><br/>I remember wanting to see this movie because I had recently rented Scent of a Woman, and I loved Pacino's speech at the end;  I wanted to see him deliver another ranting and raving speech, this time as Satan himself.

","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>The Devils Advocate is, basically, a very good idea gone wrong. The whole thing about casting Pacino as a devil -ish businessman is very interesting, and the movie could have been great if it tried to be a tense psychological drama; rather, the movie basically failed to think about its direction. There was an attempt at psychological drama played on Keanu Reeves' side, but it basically got completely lost in cheap attempts at horror effects (devil faces becoming visible) and gratuitous violence that, instead of being relevant to the plot, failed to stay connected to the main theme. As a matter of fact in the end there's an attempt at connecting the rather disjointed events by using a ""vision"" thing. However this trick seems rather inappropriate and, if anything, made the movie even cheaper.<br/><br/>Pacino is great, and delivers here one of his best performances ever. Charismatic and scary at the same time in his raspy, deep voice, he is definitely what saved the movie from being an utter failure.<br/><br/>On the other side, Keanu Reeves is worse than usual (that being already not an easy task). It seems almost laughable that such an un-charismatic character and weak spokesman could be such a good lawyer. I'm not even sure if Reeves tried to sound southern American, but his performance comes out downright laughable. There's a scene in the movie where he's supposed to be crying in desperation but his attempt at that was so awful I almost burst out laughing. I felt he was a very odd choice for this kind of character, especially because he was supposed to be the character that we should identify with or at least care for. I did neither.<br/><br/>There's actually, an extremely good and gripping part in the movie, that being the 10 minutes before our fellow advocate meets the devil after discovering his true identity. Gripping and tense. But what happens after... nothing... the whole tension deflates miserably... too bad.<br/><br/>As I said... it could have been great, but it wasn't that good...<br/><br/>6/10"

(""I'm a little more than that, Kevin."")  Pacino does NOT overact -- he is quite low-key when it's called for, and even in episodes where the screenplay could easily make him sound bombastic, there isn't a single false note in his performance.  His charisma and magnetism are such that it's not hard to imagine falling under this Devil's spell!<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is decent here -- I don't think he has much talent, but his performance as the up-and-coming lawyer Kevin Lomax, who becomes Milton's protege, is quite competent and does not drag the movie down.  (Though, after seeing ""The Firm,"" I wished they'd given the Kevin Lomax role to Tom Cruise -- who, IMHO, is very overrated, but he sure is a better actor than Keanu.)  I was very impressed by Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife Mary Ann; she does a good job of portraying her character's evolution from exuberant small-town girl to a guilt-ridden woman tormented by horrible visions.<br/><br/>The story was very well-crafted.  Some of the ""Rosemary's Baby"" stuff was overdone (like that whole scene with the baby playing with Mary Ann's ovaries -- yecch!), but the special effects with people morphing into demons were good and actually scary.  One of the things I liked about the way the story developed was that while Kevin was being tempted, Milton (as he points out in his speech toward the end) not only never made him do anything and left all the decisions to him, but gave him every opportunity to bow out and do the right thing.<br/><br/>Unlike some people, I liked the finale a lot.

I stopped thinking about issues of temptation and started giggling - and that was just when the movie got lively.<br/><br/>Pacino comes into his own in the last half hour, proving again that there's nothing on Earth more watchable that a big ham actor having the time of his life. He doesn't take it at all seriously, this where he has center stage and all his best lines, and he booms them out with fervid amusement. I've never seen him overact so badly except in ""Looking for Richard"" (where he ably demonstrated why nobody's paying him to play Shakespeare), and there the excessive broadness could be excused on the grounds that he really filming a stage role. No excuses this time, it's just plain overacting! As for the other performances, they range from competent to Keanu Reeves. As for the lovely Keanu... I will only say that he... cannot hold his own against the raging torrent that is Pacino, and that the dreadful bogus Southern accent doesn't help him to appear to have more than two neurons to rub together.<br/><br/>And just when you were having some major fun with Pacino ... you're deflated by the kind of tacked-on ending that studios insist on when they think the story's right and natural ending will hurt the box-office.
