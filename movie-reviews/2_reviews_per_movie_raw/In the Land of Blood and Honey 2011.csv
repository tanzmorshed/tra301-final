","I am no Serb/Croat/Bosnian... the film tells nothing about events i have encountered whatsoever so i have no interest whatsoever in choosing sides..,I am Just someone who enjoys cinema if it's good.But...this Film held almost nothing pour moi.The script seemed to lead nowhere..i seriously had the feeling a few times that the Director lost all control as to where we where heading.I mean we watch a couple dancing..suddenly there's an explosion en after that there is no reference to that explosion what so ever.When they later meet again, it's as if they never saw each other before.The character studies are awfully weak and stereotypical...why bother witch Photographical composition, well lit scenes etc.when awful things like mass-rape are taking place...I'v read in other reviews ' but it was very beautifully photographed' in this story that's a weakness IMO.In the first part we see the main character,Aijla wearing a lovely yellow coloured sweater..which gives great looking camera color & compositions and atmosphere...but...why? Why still bother which such details to make thing look good on a screen while mass rape and murder is taking place? some script changes are absolutely ridiculous and very far fetched.. another nuisance...the constant very close-up manner of filming the battle scenes..i found that disturbing and a style figure.....and yes.., many people complain about this ,..in this film about the Bosnian carnage the focus lies on the Serbian atrocities during this war..but that's no problem IMO..this film is a story about what happened to a part of the Bosnian victims.The Serbian side of the Bosnian-war story may be told by another film... My main objection is the creative shortcoming. It,to me was a boring movie.and should hold lessons in Filmmaker/vision For Jolie.Next time better !<br/><br/>This film to me looked like a schoolgirls naive-sentiment in viewing the horror's of war. But those horrors were not presented in a horrible way... i presume the situation in reality was hell. We see a very stylish hell..with neat framed scenes , an unbelievable and for me, totally distant sort of 'love' story.., a very weak script to act on it must have been for the actors... , nice clothing and beautiful light.<br/><br/>I was really in awe as to where the story took me..very far-fetched and naive. and the casting ...very much stereo-typing..not a creative choice of cast.Why have them speak American with a Balkan accent? you see this in a lot of films...to make it 'more realistic..but it easily becomes mediocre...It's far better & stronger to have them speak either Serb-Croatian or plain English... I never understand why they do that....and do not break-away from such a film-making dogma.<br/><br/>let this 1th directional misser be a lesson For Jolie !"
"laserburn","2","234","375","2 March 2012"," Just plain bad movie
","After watching this movie, all that I can say is that Angelina should not try to direct again. The movie is bad on so many levels, but it's the directing that clearly failed the most.<br/><br/>First, the few positives about the movie. Casting is solid, actors do a decent job even with the awful script they had, but they clearly struggle to act in English. Camera work is solid, every now and then we see an interesting shot.<br/><br/>Now, the negatives that are too many to number. The script is god damn awful, many times it makes no sense at all. It's trying to portray complexities of the main characters, but does it in a horribly cheesy and uninspiring way. Making this kind of war drama that braids the story of few characters with the broader context of war is very hard, but when done successfully, it has resulted in some of the world's most memorable movies. This is not one of them. It starts with a good idea, but then it fails in so many ways. First, it is horribly historically inaccurate and I don't mean just in the way that Serbs are wearing Hungarian throwback uniforms (because Bosnian authorities angered with insulting script have kicked the Angelina's crew out of Bosnia and the movie had to be shot in Hungary) or the wrong color of Yugoslavian passports, or the wrong weaponry which is used the wrong way, or the wrong number of reported war victims mentioned in the movie, etc. Movie manages to go into whole new, almost metaphysical level of historical inaccuracy. For instance, every Serb that we see in the movie (that we know is a Serb) wears a uniform. There is not a single Serb civilian in the whole movie. Even at the start, when two main characters go on a date, the Serb is wearing his police uniform. My god Angelina, do you know that policeman are not allowed to wear uniforms off duty? And what cop would want to go on a date wearing his beat uniform? Somewhere around the half movie finally manages to pick up a little and establish some sort of narrative flow, which is why I won't give it 1/10. But even that little good about it gets ruined by the end. Since this was supposed to be a spin on the old Romeo and Juliette tale, it made a lot of sense to finish the story in the similar way, but no, Angelina opted for the least logical ending possible."
"gallyas","2","132","220","6 March 2012"," Exceptionally..... bad.
","It was just too much to watch this film. Not in sense of what it wants to say but time wise. Wanted to leave around half time but was together with friends so stayed. I recommend you not to bother watching it as it has nothing to offer that a European does not know about the Jugoslavian war. From the perspective of romantic storyline it is also very shallow. The unfortunate thing about this film is that a talented actress tried to make a film with quite a good cast, but none of them will be looking back at it proudly. <br/><br/>Money not too well spent (meaning here the budget of film and the price I paid for the ticket)."
"bobsacamento5-305-860591","3","81","131","29 February 2012"," Emotionally Erratic
","I'm honestly quite disappointed in Angelina Jolie. I've seen all of her interviews she has given about In the Land of Blood and Honey, and her main goal was to highlight the human emotions caused by war. If this is was the human emotions she was talking about, then I think she needs to experience a war herself.<br/><br/>First off, the scene in the beginning seemed rather awkward than romantic. Their body language are not in rhythm. They are suppose to be engaging, flirting with their eyes. It almost seems as if they were waiting for the explosion to occur.<br/><br/>When Ajla get chosen to go to the rape camps, there is not enough resistance,panic or emotions between Ajla or her sister. It just seemed too swift. Then when Ajla witnesses a man getting randomly shot on their way to the rape camp, she just seemed to indifferent. I th The only scene that really got me was when Danjiel was watching another Serbian soldier step on Ajla's hand. The way she looks up in pain, but remains silent in order to be obeident was incredible. Then when the scene changes to her hugging Danjiel as her hand is in pain, you can feel the hurt between both Ajla and Danjiel.<br/><br/>The moment where Ajla's sister comes to the house to only find out her baby was thrown out the window was one of the two scenes that was extremely inconsistent with natural emotions. When you see the woman on the floor crying as Ajla's sister asks her where her baby is, you begin to get scared and anticipate what's going to happen next. Then as Ajla's sister slowly approaches the balcony, you heart begins to beat fast! Then as she looks over, you expect to hear a scream somewhere but you don't. She just covers her mouth. Now, to be fair, let's say that she's in a state of shock. So then after she discovers her baby has been thrown out, she doesn't run out the door, SHE WALKS! Then when she finally gets downstairs and holds her baby, she just holds the baby with her mouth open in silence for about 30 seconds, then! finally lets out a cry. I felt totally robbed of human emotions in that scene. It was like I was more shocked and sad the baby was dead than the mother in the film! The second terrible scene was when Danijel ties up Ajla on the bed after listening to his father tell him that Ajla is not to be trusted. When he comes back in with a gun, you can already feel the chills of the scene. As he sits next to her, he cries and contemplates on whether Ajla is his lover or enemy. Now this scene is really good, up until a point at least. After Danijel contemplates, he then proceeds to stand up and looks at her, kinda standing over her. At this point, you are holding your breath thinking like ""Is he going to kill her? Or maybe not?"" Then all of a sudden Ajla kisses him, in an attempt to convince him to spare her life. Then he leans in to slowly kiss her, at this point, you're still curling your toes because you don't know what might happen. But all of a sudden, the scene changes to Ajla and Danjiel having sex, and then the scene changes to a different part. It seemed as if Angelina just thought the sex would explain that he decided not to kill her, but it was very unfit for the scene and it just seemed cheap and lacking any artistic depth.<br/><br/>In the movie, Ajla seemed a bit too indifferent to some of the most traumatic scenes in the film, and I think Anjelina made her character too strong. Realistically, there should have been more emotional torture inside of Ajla, thus making her cry a litte more and not only when Danjiel abuses her, and when she discovers that her nephew died.<br/><br/>Overall, the storyline did not help to inform people about the devastation of the Bosnian War because the love story steered me away from the factual events of the war. Reading the notecards in the end was the most effective when informing people about the war. The ending was disappointing and dull, and I hope next time, Angelina takes notes from movies like Schindler's List. That way, when she films her movie about Afghanistan, she'll know how to successfully incorporate facts about historical events, with her storyline."
"phd_travel","3","34","51","30 August 2012"," Disjointed - doesn't engage the viewer
","This is a well intentioned film about the Bosnian war but unfortunately it doesn't work that well. Despite the powerful message it wants to deliver it doesn't draw one into the story. <br/><br/>Firstly the good points. Angelina Jolie makes a good attempt and achieves a good on location feel. The battle and destruction scenes are quite effective - realistic not exaggerated. It is interesting to see the war from 2 sides with lead characters on both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>The main problem is in the story and screenplay itself. Maybe Jolie was taking on too much by both directing and writing. There have been more main stream movies about the Balkan conflict eg Flowers for Sarajevo and Behind Enemy Lines. I understand she was trying to make a very Un Hollywood movie but maybe a bit of a more traditional dramatic narrative would have been more compelling. Continuity in the story is lacking as the story is broken up between the love and scenes of fighting and other brutalities. The romance is unconvincing. Needed some serious editing.<br/><br/>The main actress is good but the main actor is a bit cold. Their scenes together are awkward and painful to watch. <br/><br/>Overall feels schizophrenic, disjointed and self indulgent."
"KhatunaM","1","115","196","27 March 2012"," Can't be more stupid...
","Disappointing, completely and thoroughly. Completely illogical, no connection between scenes, poor acting, strange reactions by the characters. It is completely unclear what message did the plot carry and where was it going? Waste of time, full load of negative emotions! It indeed remains unclear what was the message of this film? How war is terrible thing, or how women suffer the most, or what kind of animals people can be during war times, or to show one more time how love sees now boundaries, or... It seems that screenwriter/director choose topic that is far beyond her directorial capabilities and certainly not something that one should use as plot for director's debut unless he/she knows how to get through with the initial idea on the background of other actions happening..."
"dragokin","2","19","27","30 March 2014"," black-and-white picture of the world
","In the Land of Blood and Honey passed almost unnoticed among viewers and critics alike, except in the countries that emerged from the former Yugoslavia, where it created a considerable controversy.<br/><br/>In order to understand this, we'd have to explain the history of Balkans and origins of civil war that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia. But even the executive summary of such a story would take up more time than Angelina Jolie's feature film directorial debut.<br/><br/>So if you ignore historical background and accuracy, this is essentially a bad movie. The script is idiotic and acting mediocre. In order to make the movie more realistic the characters talk in English with local dialect. This might be convincing to the average viewer but sounds stupid to anyone who knows this part of the world.<br/><br/>The only good thing is the atmosphere at the beginning of the conflict, where most of the people believed the war would be over in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>I find it remarkable that a star like Angelina Jolie devotes her times to humanitarian work and tells the world the untold stories of human suffering. At the same time it is regrettable that such stories are biased according to the current dogma envisioned by international politics and media. According to that, it is crystal clear who the good guys are and they should be absolved from all wrongdoing. On the other hand, for the supposed misdeeds of the bad guys the whole population of their country should be punished until eternity.<br/><br/>This is black-and-white image of the world which, in my opinion, is against the founding principles of UNHCR, where Angelina Jolie holds a distinguished post."
"zoranov","1","29","44","29 August 2012"," Condensed soap opera with a political message
","Most of the people can get past a pretty badly written script – otherwise there wouldn't be so many soap opera. But if you like soap operas, prepare for some really stomach-turning scenes. As someone from the Netherlands beautifully put it – it's war porn at its highest. I first heard of the movie from a newspaper story about some Serbian gangsters threatening the movie director – Angelina Jolie, if she comes to the premiere in Belgrade. <br/><br/>I said to myself, Oh my, what a treat, it must be a REALLY good movie if it made THEM angry. And, Oh my, what a terrible, horrible, heart-breaking miss. There are no 5 minutes in the movie without a major logical, artistic or documentation loophole. <br/><br/>After I saw this movie, I remembered two other movies I recently saw. One was ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"". I laughed like crazy at how outdated it was. And another one is ""The Artist"". <br/><br/>Why? Well, in this case, Angelina proved to be kind of like The Artist. Yes, we will continue to love her, how can we not? But she should remember that no matter how good a political message is for a movie, a bit of good taste is absolutely vital for a good movie. <br/><br/>And, well, she just didn't show any in this movie. Sorry, Angelina. You're still no Clint Eastwood. Maybe some other day, after you shoot some 20 more thousands zombies, aliens, Russians and so on. <br/><br/>I could go on for pages like this. But, in conclusion, only one more vital thing for understanding why my grade is so low compared to the movie's budget.<br/><br/>What beautiful two main characters actors Angelina had! And what an incredible mess. How limited was the connection between them! <br/><br/>One point. One extra point for just having Angelina trying to make a point and investing such a huge effort in it. It really makes my heart melt. (At least she tried to make a point, unlike so many directors recently.) One extra point for choosing so many actors from the countries in the region the story actually takes place in. It's really admirable, as well as the fact that she tried to film it in Serbia. <br/><br/>Also, I liked the fact that the main character actors are, coincidentally or not, really Serbian Orthodox and Muslim, exactly like in the movie. It is almost like a reconciliation message in the PR story.<br/><br/>Finally, I really liked the fact that the movie was filmed in the local languages as well. Wow, what a beautiful beautiful gesture."
"stowevt024","1","77","129","26 February 2012"," Not a love story, a betrayal is the operative word. ""I'm Sorry"" No she wasn't
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I have to agree with one of the other members, ""...as bad as a movie can be..."", exactly. The acting was sub-par and the dialogue, which very little existed, was mostly monotone and single word phrases. I am not going to get into the political aspects of the movie or who was right and who was wrong in the Bosinian Conflict. Absent politics and absent whose fault it was this movie was a complete WASTE. Jolie should stick to acting in the crappy movies she stars in and forget about directing. I only watched the movie in its entirety because I was hoping it would get better and not only did it not get better it got worse. Maybe I did not pick up on the obvious but was the bar scene, at the beginning of the movie, the first time two main characters first meet? And if so are we to take from that that he will risk his live to save her when the conflict is in full gear? Not believable. When she says her final words to him ""...I'm sorry..."" does that mean she was in on the bombing? And for all the rave reviews out there please, Get out more."
"julianacardosoaraujo","4","18","27","15 August 2012"," Confusing...
","I was really looking forward to watch this movie since the Bosnia war is such a present event and I still remember articles and news footage form the conflict. The beginning is quite promising and the plot seemed quite simple and interesting (even though done a thousand of times before, I think for all wars possible) but after the first violent shot I started to get confused and the story got quite boring with plain flashes of free violence that I guess were there just to shock the viewer and cover the lack of depth of this movie. It was very disappointing and rather violent with no sense and mingled in a , maybe, attempt to be original and to cover something you know nothing about.<br/><br/>It left a sense of emptiness and also exploitation of a such recent war. Maybe keeping the original language instead of forced English would have helped a bit but I doubt that. I am really surprised that a woman had the courage to direct this and place such a display of nothing.<br/><br/>This could have been a wonderful story and instead is just a festival of shocking images and moments that after a while get tiring and predicable. <br/><br/>The end was quite surprising and there again with a meaning of nothing.<br/><br/>This was probably the worst war- love movie I have ever seen and 127 minutes of life I could have used to do something more interesting."

","I find it difficult to watch as a movie ..maybe a documentary would have been a better route? <br/><br/>It is slow and mostly about the raping encounters and not so much of a romance between enemies. The guy wants to love her and her love him back but I feel it is difficult to love if your a captive. Especially if you put your beloved captive in immediate danger of being raped by your fellow comrades. I didn't see as much hash cruelty that I have read about as just raping the women. I have literally lost count of them and I am still watching it. I have actually met a Bosnian soldier and have heard a little about this war. Maybe I was expecting more than I am getting. Overall thus far it is nearly finished now the special effects are good but the story not so much. I am trying to be as polite as I can too."
"bossfaria","3","40","69","5 March 2012"," Big disappontment
","I am a Bosnian Muslim myself and my husband was a prisoner in a Serb held concentration camp. I was truly disappointed in this movie. Both main characters were greatly underdeveloped and their actions were often not understandable. The cuts were terrible, a lot of scenes left unfinished, unexplained. All throughout the movie I was not able to really connect with the main character Ajla. I couldn't and I didn't feel sorry for her (which is terrible from a woman's point of view). The baby killing (or lack of) scene was so unnecessary and it felt really out of place. I watched many Bosnian made movies (Perfect Circle, No Man's Land, Remake) and this is the first that didn't make me cry. Largely unrealistic and far fetched. Script was also bad and as someone mentioned Ajla was quite inexpressive which is bizarre for a rape/war victim. Her nakedness and her staying in Danijel's room was also unrealistic and really not suitable for a movie about rape victims. I give it a 3/10 because of Angelina's effort to put my country back on the map."

","The story was sequenced without actual lead. No reality was involved, in one scene Aila was brutally raped in next she looks happy and having sex with her loving man etc. There are traces of true but whole story of Bosnian war was completely simplified. This looks like a bad copy of Emir Kusturica movie ""Life is a miracle"" 2004. Angelina Jolly should look this movie and she wouldn't probably never made this film. At the end it looks like somebody ordered cheap story for daily use. Pity! On the other hands actors did professional job. Scenes and environment are very realistic and authentic. Music is somehow out of story. I think that scenario had potential but with lot of changes and adjustment."
"ghost_dog86","5","95","195","2 February 2012"," The Bosnian War: A Love Story?
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Before I begin,<br/><br/>I would like to preface this review by saying that I am in no way an expert on the Bosnian War. So, before I receive any hate mail from angry Bosnian's or Serbian's about how I am just a stupid American who is criticizing events that I didn't live through, please realize that I am not criticizing Bosnian's or Serbians or war tactics or cultural differences. My job is to criticize FILMS!!! Angelina Jolie hates Serbians, there I said it! I am joking of course, she loves all races. Angelina Jolie (Salt) receives her first writing and feature film directing credits here in ""In the Land of Blood and Honey""; a film that is surprisingly almost entirely in Serbian and Bosnian. There has been some controversy (at least there was for a few months) about this actually being an idea Jolie stole and called her own. But after all is said and done, whether or not she came up with the original idea will be the least controversial aspect to arise from this film. Starring Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic, it is not the acting which drags this film down, it is the storyline Jolie chooses to focus on instead of a straight forward war story. Chronicling the systematic encampment, rape and slaughter of the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) ethnic group during the Bosnian War sounds like some very compelling and powerful material, and ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" would have been compelling and powerful, if that was what the movie was about. Instead we get a love story, set in the Bosian War between a high ranking male Bosnian Serb soldier (Kostic) named Danijel and his female Bosniak prisoner (Marjanovic) named Ajla, and a very unsatisfying love story at that. In fact the few instances when the story turns its focus from Ajla to her sister, who has not been captured and is attempting to build a resistance against the Serbs, the film becomes far more interesting and gritty. So much so, that an argument could be made about how Ajla's sister would have made a more realistic and compelling focus for this full length feature film than Ajla herself. Furthermore, without Ajla's sister's subplot, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is a war film that only lightly dabbles in the brutality of war for less than a third of the movie and then it's back to the flimsy love story. In the end, Jolie attempts to address the political, brutal and cultural elements that make war so complex, but spends far, far, far too much time telling the remedial Romeo and Juliet love story between Danijel and Ajla. I am not against love stories by any means, but to have an average love story set during a fairly recent war, where genocide, rape, and political cover-ups took place, the love story aspect tends to take away (or dumb down) every other important point the film is attempting to make. This is kind of like having a hardcore love story in ""Schindler's List"". It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>What will undoubtedly anger mass audiences the most: Because of the way Jolie structures her film, the tone inevitably does come off as one sided in the same way the aforementioned ""Schindler's List"" does. Which in and of itself isn't bad, i.e. Nazi's are horrible people. But because ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is a far less developed film, the ""all Serbian's (except for one) are inherently ruthless and cruel"" mentality this film encourages, comes off as unnaturally skewed especially to those (like me) who are unfamiliar with the in-depth events of the Bosnian War. Now I am not saying that the Serbs in this film, who are shown ethnically cleansing a mass group of Muslims, were not horrible people, BUT the way this movie presents an entire race (The Serbs) as irrational and blood-thirsty, could be perceived as quite one sided. And for that reason, I can see many audiences finding this the most off-putting aspect of ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"". But then again, I am not a critic of wars.<br/><br/>Final Thought: I will give Jolie some credit here for manufacturing some brilliant shots (mostly the war scenes) that work to show her talent behind a camera. But much as Jolie tries, it seems as if she knows more about the logistics of a love story than about creating a compelling war film. Not to say that ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" isn't a watchable effort, and does minimally redeem itself in the final two scenes of the film, BUT how this film was nominated for a Golden Globe only proves that the Hollywood Foreign Press will do anything to hang out with big stars.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","NOTE: Viewed the English language version, where actors stumbled to sell their lines with conviction, visibly struggling to preserve their acting chops in the unfamiliar English-language environment.<br/><br/>Set in the brutal Bosnian civil war, directorial débutant Angeline Jolie, delivers a devastating account of the atrocities that occurred during the war, mainly pointing fingers at the Serbian side, while ostensibly siding with the women, the oft forgotten, but most harshly brutalised victims of war. Subject to imprisonment, where they are treated as slave labour, play toys and subject to everyday rape (together with the subsequent pregnancies), knives of fury open up during viewing. Somehow however within this onslaught of injustice Jolie attempts to introduce a romantic backdrop to the story...<br/><br/>Bosniak painter Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) is captured and sent into a strict prisoner camp, where she encounters her former love, Yugoslav People's Army commander Danijel (Goran Kostic). Still enticed by Ajla, Danijel manages to save her from rape victimisation and announces her to be his private woman. Rigid and at times ostensibly cold Danijel does not however force himself on Ajla, instead attempting to rekindle the lost affections of the past despite the murderous genocidal occurrences in abundance. Within this brutal war convictions and feelings must struggle to survive...<br/><br/>In what has been aptly described as war porn, Jolie best succeeds in presenting war atrocity with some impressive and well-designed sets to compliment the story and the despicable ongoings where civilians are worst affected by the insanity. Rape, denigration, brutalisation are everyday life for encaptured women, while not even a screaming baby is safe from the illogical brutality of civil war. For some death is the better alternative...<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Angelina Jolie struggles to find any rhythm in the movie, instead acting out as a disjointed mess lacking dramatic punch. Attempting a more artistic feel, inspired by movies such as ""Behind Enemy Lines"", first time helmer fails to instill any life into the drab, murky proceedings, leaving a lifeless exterior, which struggling to bring about any emotions apart from the apparent shock factors. Scenes with Ajla and Danijel are always awkward, somewhat detached, making the whole affair a cumbersome attempt at romance, but without conviction. It could be argued that this is purposeful, as given the war implication anything other than this disjointed, half-hearted romance is impossible. However this encapsulating dreariness within an over-reaching two hour run-time makes for an excruciating watch into hopelessness and despair, as viewer attention aimlessly wanders in between atrocities (during which in turn eyes tend to not want to be open to see)."
"DICK STEEL","6","23","51","8 March 2012"," A Nutshell Review: In the Land of Blood and Honey
","There's something in the air these days with military related, history based dramas about conflict hitting our shores all at the same time. There's Act of Valor and its war on terror against a fictional opposition, and both 5 Days of War and The Land of Blood and Honey take on a look back at the 2008 Russo-Georgian conflict and the 1992-1995 Bosnian War respectively, weaving a fictional story in front of an historical backdrop, the former aligning itself closer to an action film, and this one being a more dramatic take that deals with a forbidden romance.<br/><br/>Written, directed and co-produced by Angelina Jolie, one wonders what went through her thought process when she decided to take up duties and responsibilities from behind the camera instead of in front of it, and to have one's directorial feature debut deal with such a heavy topic about genocide, sexual violence, and the inner beasts that mankind has the propensity to turn into when fighting for beliefs, regardless whether right or wrong. I suppose being a UN ambassador had exposed her to various peacekeeping and charitable causes around the globe, and something must have triggered that spark within her to come up with a troubled romance story set amidst one of the worst times in human history. She doesn't shy away from graphic portrayal of the many atrocities committed by the aggressors, and showed how humanity can crumble into nonchalance through murky politics, and when it decides to sit back from the outside and do nothing.<br/><br/>That's the macro picture, and the film balances it with a micro look at a more personal level through the eyes of the protagonists, Serbian Danijel (Goran Kostic) and Bosnian Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), who begins the film looking very optimistic and expectant of her date with the former, at a time of peace and tranquility if not for a bomb blast to signal the end of harmony, and a prelude of the unimaginable and inexplicable violence to come. Not before long the land is plunged into civil war, with Bosnian civilians bearing the brunt of it in what would be genocide and ethnic cleansing. As it turns out, Ajla and her family become victims, while as fate would have it for Danijel to actually be a Serbian captain under the strict, uncompromising orders from his military father, and their paths to cross when Ajla got arrested and forced into labour in a camp, if not for Danijel to come to her aid, claiming her to be his property to starve off any sexual advances from his men.<br/><br/>The romance here is something that drifted into mediocrity with this protection accorded not going down well amongst the ranks, and Danijel getting into a love-hate relationship of sorts with Ajla, where in times much better than the present, would have evolved into something more beautiful than forceful. It's an open secret love affair that grew, and brought to life only by Zana Marjanovic's strong performance as a woman out to survive her ordeal. Marjanovic brings about a balance in both vulnerability and steely strength in her character of Ajla, who has to decide on her emotions, whether or not she can literally fall in love and be sleeping with the enemy, while Kostic's own performance deals with the ability to show compassion, or be seduced by a master-slave power that overwhelms, and slowly but surely corrupts and spirals into obsessive suspicion and paranoia.<br/><br/>What became more intriguing as the narrative wore on, was the similarities with Ang Lee's Lust, Caution in the second half of the film, where a woman found herself tasked to do a job to make a stand for the oppressed and her people, given her natural charms and close proximity to do so. The conflicts of emotions, and the suspense, especially since how a scheme sans details got mooted served as an inflection point, and will leave you guessing whether will she, or won't she, and even then, how it can actually all take place since she's isolated almost all the time in a fortified location, and we aren't in the clear of any details if any were discussed at all, given the apparent vagueness. The final scene between Danijel and Ajla is intense and will serve as a talking point given the quick, convenient and inevitable way to closure.<br/><br/>But like 5 Days of War, this film is fairly lop-sided in its politics, so focus not on that but on the relationship that is Romeo-and-Juliet-ish involving star crossed lovers from opposite sides of the land trying to keep the flickering flame of their love affair alive amongst the chaos and destruction around them."

It does not show any Western Powers influence in the war, it is lacking of any historical details, uniforms, etc. It is shot in Hungary due to Muslim portion of Government ban at the time. Uniforms are wrong, weaponry is wrong; it does not depict any air assaults by Western Powers on Serbian Military (backed by Serbian Military) and ground military assaults by Croatian-Muslim Army (backed up by Western Powers). And finely war resolution in Dayton resulting in one impotent country. It does not show any Western Powers involvement in the war predominantly Germany an USA I am looking forward for her next story and movie in West Bank and Jerusalem (Palestinian side)."

","I have just finished watching the movie. Is this movie the best thing what had happened to Bosnia? Definitely not... Is this movie the worst thing what has happened to Serbia? Most definitely not. Serbian people should just take a deep breath and watch the movie before rating.<br/><br/>Rade's character- who was completely grotesque( although well played) and your standard issue of bad Serbs(diabolically laughing when shooting somebody?Really?)It's not positive factor of this movie. I believe less bla bla -my mother hands were rough and she had 7 kids and better dialogues would suffice. Some dialogues were bad. Especially the ones between Danjiel and Ajla. I didn't feel their emotions at all.<br/><br/>As for acting. Zana with all due my respect acted like an wooden doll. Shehad the same facial expression all the time.( Maybe Natascha Petrovic can teach how eyes can show all emotions)Goran was way better in his part just sometimes what he said made him look slightly retarded. The lovemaking scenes didn't make it up for the lack of good dialogues. She was naked quite a lot( and quite happy about being naked) and it was a bit out of place when trying to make serious movie about a rape camp.Also who hired the actress who played Alja's sister? Her acting was terrible.<br/><br/>I didn't like the way she portrayed Bosnian Army. In 1993 they were organized. They fought like lions and they do deserve respect and admiration. I haven't seen it in this movie at all.<br/><br/>The movie is not so brutal as some were saying. The rape is there but it was watchable.As for the killing of the baby- wasn't necessary to have it in the movie at all.<br/><br/>AJ had good intention to put everything in but you can't do that cause the movie will be too rushed. This what has happened to this particular movie.<br/><br/>OK now the good things about this movie. The soundtrack is beautiful. Some scenes were really well done. It's not 50-50 movie( how can it be really? The sides didn't have 50-50 weapons either) but it did show a few normal Serbian soldiers. Also Daniel's as character is quite complex and he is apparently in love with Ajla but he loves his father even more( or fears). <br/><br/>The events in the movie were not a lie and they did happened.There are parts in the movie which are 100 % work of fiction.Rape camps, concentration camp are not these parts. Both were built in the war and are unfortunate reminder of human cruelty.<br/><br/>This movie had a great potential but It is clearly a work of the beginner.I had great expectation for this movie. I thought it will be at least as good as the movie As if I'm not there. But my expectations were not fulfilled.In a way it's good that this movie was made. It might attract better directors to make better movies about this war. Bosnian war needs to be remembered."

What else could she have done better? <br/><br/>I can understand, she stirred a lot in the mood of audience, making people feel bad about what happened in front of the eyes of all world,especially the Europeans, simply watching and waiting it ended somehow.<br/><br/>And again, it must be a woman who was courageous enough to hold the mirror into the faces of people, men especially with so much ignorance and hypocrisy.

"nkumsa","10","39","103","7 April 2012"," Symbolic and Very Raw
","Watching this movie was hell. Which I suppose is a bad and a good thing. Bad because I allowed myself to sit in front of the screen for 2 hours and relive the pain. Good because Angelina Jolie did a pretty good job of filming this movie. I am still not quite certain what always brings Angelina back to Bosnia and her affinity for our people, but I am glad that she took such an interest in what happened because she is showing the world what happened. This movie has completely changed my opinion of her. Before watching this movie, I thought this would be more of a sappy twisted love story between a Bosnian woman and Serb man and the focus would be on them versus the actual events of the war. But no, what Angelina did was much smarter than that, much more symbolistic and representative of the actual war. I took plenty of notes during the movie because she made it a point to use symbolism to show you exactly what was happening in the war. She didn't need to explicitly tell you the messages she was trying to highlight. You could see them for yourself. Perhaps the Serbs picked up on this as well and that's why they didn't want to show this movie in their country, but either way the love story was just as much a part of the symbolism as was the actual depiction of the murders, rapes, and torturing of the people. The love story was actually not sappy and not a Hollywood plot of getting you to watch the film, rather it was a means of small-scaling the war for the viewer. By that I mean that she juxtaposed the generalities of what happened in the war with what happened in their relationship. If you told me that a Bosnian made this movie, it wouldn't have surprised me but the mere fact that an American actress did this who hasn't lived a day in the life of a Bosnian during the war, shows you how sheer genius her script really is. The movie starts out with the Bosnian Muslim woman and the Serb man dancing, enjoying one anothers company together in a seemingly carefree and enjoyable environment. Without a warning to them or the viewer, their scene together is bombed, ending their blissful fate together and separating them into the roles that the Serb army has dictated for them. The woman is hand picked along with other women to become the personal slaves of Serb soldiers at one of their camps, while the man is the son of one of the largest army leaders in the war and forced to be on the front lines. I wasn't sure if she was trying to insinuate that the father of the man was Ratko Mladic or not (their resemblance was uncanny) but I don't think that she meant that as her focus anyways. Bosnia started out the same way. Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Serbs, and Bosnian Croats lived together in relative harmony before the war. These 'ethnic issues' that we talk about now were minimal and never enough to come close to even the idea of a war this size. The abrupt bombing of the harmonious scene between the two protagonists mirrors the ideas of Radovan Karadic and Radko Mladic firing up their army men and their quick destruction of Muslim towns. The film continues, showing the mass rapes of the women day in and day out by Serb soldiers. Watching these scenes was so hard that I had to stop the film a couple of times simply because I knew I couldn't watch them. I could literally feel my body being affected watching this movie because my heart started to pound for these women, I started to shake, and I couldn't breathe as I watched what happened to them. It's not like this was my first time watching a film about Bosnia. I've read, heard, and seen plenty of things about Bosnia to tell you all of the same facts that someone would whose actually lived it. The major difference, though, is that I haven't lived it and whenever I watch these rapes, killings, and torturings happen, I just can't even function. I feel numb. I feel like all of my insides have turned to ice. I feel like I'm watching this outside of my body. The war in Bosnia was actually the first was where sexual crimes against women were legally considered a war crime in the Hague and international courts of law. Angelina knew that and obviously repeatedly wanted to share that message throughout the movie. Rape was just another means of the Serbs wanting to control Bosnia. Raping these women was the Serbians way of showing power over them, showing power over the Muslims. Raping these women was a symbolism of raping Bosnia of half of their power and sustanenance of their society. It doesn't matter that maybe the exact characters Angelina used were fictional, her point was that this is what really happened. She didn't make this just a scene in another movie. These are the stories of women from Bosnia who have survived the war. These rapes were real and as horrifying as it is for you to watch them, these women have to live with what happened for the rest of their lives. That thought, moreso than the actual rape scene, is what scared me the most."
"ventsyv-303-138587","5","23","57","26 February 2012"," Bad story development and 1 dimensional characters, but OK overall
","It's not a bad movie. Actually it would have been a pretty good if it was a Bosnian movie, but it does not live up to the expectations of a Hollywood movie of a major movie star. <br/><br/>The story was weak - the main characters meet once, then they meet again when she is kidnapped by Serbian soldiers and they are suddenly in love. It feels like they were in a relationship before the war but the movie never makes that clear. <br/><br/>There is no background on the war, no explanation why any of these events are taking place, no reason where the all that hate is coming from.<br/><br/>The characters stroke me as emotionless. I understand that some of that could be attributed to being used to seeing death and atrocities during the war, but there is little war footage and it feels fake.<br/><br/>There is some character development, the Serbian commander has some second thoughts about the reasons behind the war, but overall he simply goes along with everything with little to no emotion and giving very little insight in his thoughts reasoning.<br/><br/>The cinematography was good, the acting was pretty good, the story is original and engaging even though it's not developed well. <br/><br/>""No Man's Land"" is much better movie on the Bosnian war in my opinion."
"ikillforcookies","7","30","79","28 February 2012"," A movie denounced as one-sided by those that are one-sided
","I came home in a state of uncomfortable distress after watching this movie. It's been an hour now since it ended and I still can't shake the feeling that awakening the spirits of the Bosnian war in such a gruesome fashion was in bad taste.<br/><br/>However, I also feel the need to address some of the unfounded accusations made against the movie and its director in some of the more politically motivated reviews. In fact, this is my first IMDb review. I registered an account for the purpose of doing this movie justice.<br/><br/>Is the movie one-sided? Depends on what you mean by the term. All war movies are one-sided in a way. No WWII movie depicts the Germans and the allies, or even the Germans and the Soviet, as equally guilty. There's a reason for that. They're not. While both sides in every war are always guilty of cruelty, there is always one side that excels in that department. In WWII that side was clearly the Germans - in the Bosnian war those lines were far more blurred. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that no side was more guilty than the others.<br/><br/>The fact remains that the movie only depicts Serbian crimes, but that is only natural for a movie that takes place in a Serbian prison camp, inside Serbian territory. Imagine if a movie about Auschwitz made a quick jump to a Soviet gulag for the sake of balance! That wouldn't be fair or neutral, it would be perfectly ridiculous! In order for 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' to show Croatian or Muslim crimes, it would have to miraculously float out of the setting into a different place with a different set of characters.<br/><br/>In fact, Angelina Jolie makes a point of allowing her characters to at least verbally describe the other side's atrocities, and makes a (admittedly, relatively tame) attempt at putting some blame on the international union and its response (or lack there of). Rade Serbedzija's monologue about the Hanjar division, which was a predominantly Muslim unit operating within Heinrich Himmler's SS is far more successful. It explains that the innate hatred he has for Muslims didn't come out of 1990s politics - the peoples of ex Yugoslavia have been in wars, civil and otherwise, against one another much before there were cameras to record it.<br/><br/>You may complain about why no movies have been made about the equally horrific Croatian war camps, but that argument really has no place in a review of this movie. 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' may be one-sided from that perspective, but that one side is depicted accurately so there's no room for crying about it.<br/><br/>Another common complaint is the lack of background in the movie. Why did the war happen? Why the hatred? Why the raping? The thing is, this movie wasn't meant to be a war epic and it doesn't make any attempts in that direction. It is a personal story about two people. And maybe, just maybe, you should have some general idea about the biggest military conflict in Europe since WWII without Angelina Jolie talking you through it? The script itself is compelling, but the Serbian translation of some English expressions was quite embarrassing for a movie with such a budget. Surely, they could afford to hire someone would could tell them that the phrase 'I haven't had this much fun in days' doesn't exist in that form in the Serbian language, and that it shouldn't, under any circumstances, be translated literally.<br/><br/>The two main characters are well-defined and realistic, as is Danijel's father, but the people around them are mostly sketches of stereotypical soldier and victim types. This doesn't hurt the movie much, as no other characters are really crucial to the story.<br/><br/>With that said, and the count of real characters low, it is only natural to expect the movie to be packed with events from start to finish. It seems Jolie's intention was to stuff every terrible aspect of the war into 2 hours, and it really doesn't give you any room to relax; no humorous relief, not even the exceptionally dark humor of some other movies about Bosnia. One that comes to mind is Pretty Village Pretty Flame, which is a very good movie in its own right, but looks like a slightly sinister comedy compared to what I watched tonight.<br/><br/>All in all, once you get over the fact that you are not going to be taught a history lesson by this movie, you may begin to see it as a story of two people destroying each other in the midst of a slaughter neither of them understands.<br/><br/>P.S. The 'factual error' on the movie page saying the uniforms Serbian soldiers wear are not authentic, is not really an error. In 1992, there was no 'Serbian army' to speak of, it was the Yugoslav National Army which was commanded from Belgrade. The soldiers wore uniforms with Yugoslav symbols for the simple reason that they didn't have any other uniforms. Later on in the war, that changed, and as the movie progresses, you don't see any more communist insignia on the Serbs' uniforms. In other words, why is everyone so intent on nitpicking about Angelina Jolie's first effort as a director?"
"mickeychasetan","9","35","95","28 February 2012"," View of the Bosnian War
","Why all the low reviews for this movie, In the Land of Blood and Honey is not the best war movie out right now, but the reviews by many first time reviewers here should be red flag for IMDb moderators. It does show the compassion that both sides had and that not all are war mongers and a racist people. The conflict in the region goes back hundreds of years, but that is history and for it to be repeated again does give us a view into our own inhumanity towards one another.<br/><br/>The term ethnic cleansing was made well know from this conflict and by it is a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas. This did take place in the Bosnian War and it was well documented that most of it was carried out by the Serb population. Again, I believe this was much better movie than most reviewers saw in it.<br/><br/>It was well acted and directed and should have a wider following."

"ligonlaw","9","91","276","22 January 2012"," Excellent Acting, Cinematography and Directing
","Ms. Jolie's work as an actress cuts across a wide range of genres. One can never be sure what to expect. From absolute excellence in ""Girl Interrupted"" and ""Changeling"" to competent and interesting in her action films, Ms. Jolie reaches occasional greatness. Other films pay well for her star quality. <br/><br/>Her reputation was once tabloid junk food. As a young woman, she was known for being immature, outlandish and a little weird. Ms. Jolie has matured and become a humanitarian, and it seems that her mission in life to have some sort of impact on those less fortunate. Very few people are as fortunate as she is. She earns millions of dollars making movies, is admired for her looks by men and women alike, and she is married to one of Hollywood's icons.<br/><br/>Her directorial debut with ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is a film about the genocide by Serbian nationalists against Bosnian Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Western world was introduced to the war's atrocities when the nightly news from 1992 to 1995 aired footage of snipers killing civilian men, women and children in Sarajevo as they attempted to get food and water. The Serbs lobbed bombs from the hills surrounding the city, killing anyone who happened to be in the way. The world looked on as heavily armed Serbs murdered civilians and destroyed what had been one of the most beautiful cities in the world.<br/><br/>Ms. Jolie's film imposes a Romeo and Juliet theme in the foreground while rape, murder and unspeakable acts occur in the background. A couple meets at a club. They are very much in love, and they dance away the evening, aware of only each other. This blissful moment is interrupted by an explosion which kills a number of the people at the club. <br/><br/>We learn that the girl is Bosnian and Muslim, and her lover is Serbian, the son of a general who wants to wipe every Bosnian Muslim from the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>We have seen some of these scenes in other movies. The theme of Serbian ethnic cleansing of Muslims has been explored before. The use of rape by the Serbs to terrorize and dehumanize women has also been the subject of other films. <br/><br/>Once the women are on the bus, we know they are not headed anywhere nice. The men in the village are killed and put in a large ditch. These are relatively graphic scenes of violence. The women are taken to the troops for sexual entertainment. Anyone who challenges the authority of the Serbian military is shot immediately. The women serve the needs of the soldiers.<br/><br/>We see Romeo at the Serbian military base where he is a captain in charge of a company of Serbs. They kill Muslims by day and drink by night. They rape the women when they feel like it.<br/><br/>Our Romeo spares his Juliet by taking her out of the pool of women who will be used by the soldiers. She is a fine artist, and he finds a nice room for her, which is her cell. They drink wine and dine in the evening. He participates in horror during the day, but he relaxes with his captive in the evening. She is conflicted about her preferential treatment when her family and friends are enduring the tortures of the damned. She has no real choice in the matter.<br/><br/>When his father, the general in charge of ethic cleansing, discovers that he is keeping a Muslim woman in his apartment. The father orders a solder to rape her and he berates his son for failing to hate all Muslims as he does.<br/><br/>This is a tragic story about men who were willing to engage in acts of pure evil. How do rape and murder and vile acts of violence demonstrate a belief in Christianity or a belief that one's faith is superior to another? It has always been my understanding that the Catholic Church abhors rape and murder. There is no explanation. We see men who murder, rape, drink and tell jokes about their lives seemingly unburdened by guilt. There are a few Serbs who question their actions, but the pangs are temporary and they return to the killing and raping of their enemies.<br/><br/>This is a film that will not please Serbian audiences as it shines a light on the war crimes committed against a people, a people they may still hate.<br/><br/>Ms. Jolie's direction was excellent as the characters came alive under her guidance. <br/><br/>Bravo."
"val_junuzovic","10","33","90","4 March 2012"," Angelina did a beautiful job directing this film.
","This has been the best movie I've ever seen! It's not propaganda, this stuff really did happen! I am shocked at the fact that people refuse to be realistic about this. We can argue all day about who started the war, who won the war.. but there's no denying that genocide and very violent, horrific crimes on humanity took place MAINLY against the Bosnians. Not saying it was ONLY the Bosnians, but a majority of the very violent and brutal war crimes were directed towards the Bosniaks, Bosnian Muslims. <br/><br/>It sickens me that these actions are being ""justified"" by some people saying ""it's propaganda"". So you're telling me that all the witnesses, such as myself, all the news reporters, and pretty much the rest of the world has got it wrong? Give me a break! As a survivor, I find this EXTREMELY insulting, to say the least. Also, in my opinion, I really feel like the Muslims have a horrible reputation and are stereotyped as killers, suicidal maniacs, terrorists... So, why would anyone LIE just to make them the victim or even protect them? <br/><br/>I am not taking the sides of the Serbs, Bosnians, Croats... I just want to stick up for all the victims, whatever their religious beliefs. I have nothing against Serbians at all! I am actually very close to my Serbian cousins. However, I do have great anger toward people that have committed genocide, crimes against humanity, rape, killed children and women... Unfortunately, in this particular war, the sad truth is that it was, in fact, the Serbians who committed these brutal acts against the Bosnians. I know everyone wants to stick up for THEIR own people; However, denying that this happened is such a slap in the face to the very many people that had to go through this. Myself included. I could never stick up for something like this, my morals are valued a little bit more than my pride. <br/><br/>Either way, I am extremely appreciative of Angelina Jolie, my hero, taking time out of her life to share the story of the VICTIMS. Thank you, Angelina, for thinking of us. She is such a great hearted person and an extremely creative director. I wish I could tell her in person. <br/><br/>May God bless every victim, no matter what religious belief, and may God have mercy on the people who committed these heinous crimes, no matter what religion they may be."

","How I was surprised! I started to watch this film, with so many bad notes made upon it. Like witch hunt. I am Serb, and I had problems when go outside of my country why being a Serb. They said in the media that it is both ""a bad film"" and ""Serbs are again presented bad"", so I did not go to see the premiere, which I now really regret. Film is excellent, it is mine opinion.<br/><br/>Thank you Angelina, because you did more for this region with this film, then all the politicians and movie makers from region did.<br/><br/>Politicians never started to talk about this ""hot potato"" subject, really, truthfully, yet it is of extreme importance to be talked about. Artists from all kinds waived that subject, fearing this kind of criticism that Angelina suffers. She has suffered true media mobbing, totally out of any reason and/or real arguments.<br/><br/>Why? Because it is love story, and story about man's essence in the war. It can be watched more times then one (already did second view) because it has many layers in it. Everybody expected I do no know what. Classical war action, maybe? War atrocities? Nothing of this is brutally depicted in the film, because the film paid maximum attention to the viewer. It is gentle speaking of real truth about war in Bosnia.<br/><br/>Not all Serbs are criminals. Who watched this film carefully, COULD HAVE seen it. Film was not about taking sides on who is guilty for war in Bosnia. It is almost Orwellian love story between two young Romeo and Juliet, who could not resist so much hate around them to develop their love.<br/><br/>Film has a strong message: Give chance to love! Now about some solutions of Angelina: I really liked the beginning, because nothing was said about the bomb. It is really unimportant for the story. Scenario was sharp, not neglected.Lights were kept natural, because of documentary style, to tight viewer to his seat, like he is there, like the story is live and ongoing. All characters were like shaken, like half-developed, because they are half-developed, they can not show their true faces, because only war and hate are aloud to show their face. All characters are in the middle, having nowhere to go, just to obey, or to be killed, like puppets. Yet, if you look the film twice, or more carefully first time, you will see the characters.<br/><br/>Going from America, it is as original, and as good, as no film I watched in ten years. It really moved me. Not only me, but my friends too. Yet, when film is great, and radically about something, even love, it always picks up bad critics, or suffer to be ridiculed.<br/><br/>I hope, when time passes, and much more people watch this film carefully, people from all 3 sides will thank you.<br/><br/>Until then, I must say my thanks first. Thank you Angelina, for this excellent film, as a man whose country was part of the conflict, and as big movie fan. I did not like much new American films, as for watching them you do not need no brains, just eyes. Your movie gives me hope for American film. There are some true artists in America, after all..."

I mean come on, I bet most of us have never lived in war, and I guess no one will ever know the truth, but in the Bosnian War especially, there was ethnical cleansing, which means of course they would rape the women, shoot on spot, and do other horrific acts. We watch movies for many different reasons, but we shouldn't judge the movie about being one sided or not,so enough of the ""one sided"" argument, just enjoy the emotions and thought it brings to your soul."
"begicevica","9","84","262","24 January 2012"," A test for love?
","It is admirable that Jolie, an American Hollywood actress who was only seventeen years old when the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out, gives the voice to the voiceless. Jolie, as an insider, tells the story of Ajla and Danijel; two young people from Sarajevo who started dating only days before the war broke out. Those were the days when it did not matter who is of what ethnic origin. Ajla; as Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic; as Daniel, are brilliant in their roles. Their chemistry is beautiful and their love complicated by political circumstances in which they suddenly find themselves. Ajla is a young painter and a (grand)daughter of lefties-""partizans""; as such she was oblivious to religion. Danijel, who was a police officer before the war is under the influence of his father. His father remembers his parents being killed in World War Two and for him, the Muslims should take the blame. The movie depicts scenes of shelling and sniping of Sarajevo, it shows the scenes from Grbavica and how women were separated from men and taken to Serb run concentration camps. Jolie takes time to tell a heartbreaking story of women in war. She gives voice to the voiceless-all those who were victims of rape and sexual violence in this conflict. The movie is difficult to watch at the times, but it is indeed an important movie to see. It is a very complicated love story; it is about social realities, it is about politics, family and social relationships and more importantly, it is about trust. Can love their stand it?"

I dare to predict that this masterpiece will become a part of every school curriculum and a major exhibit in every historical museum. Every individual with a little bit of self-respect should see this powerful revelation. I also dare to say that this movie alone automatically puts Angelina Jolie among the greatest film directors in movie history and not only that but the fact that she is also the writer and the producer of this brilliant piece of art makes her something even more- a colossus! Big Hollywood directors with a few dozen of hit movies can only dream to produce a film this big. That's not just a lifetime achievement but a giant leap forward for the entire mankind!"

","Everyone's been fuzzing about this movie, reviewing it and commenting (mostly bad things) about it, so I wasn't very eager to watch it. A very good friend of mine with whom we have similar taste in books and movies told me that it was not worth the time, so I didn't bother to watch it, because honestly I don't think that it's a good thing when actors become directors, singers - actors etc... But, when I finally decided to see this film, I wasn't expecting very much and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed it very much. I felt it. I know that most of the audience (especially the one from the Balkan) is thinking that an American actress don't have anything to do interfering with the Balkan history, but I think that Jolie studied her subject on the matter and did an amazing job presenting it to the worldwide audience. The thing about this story being a fictional one set in war that actually occurred is also a fact that shouldn't bother the audience and stop it from enjoying this great film, because I don't think it's fair to enjoy a fictional story about Jack and Rose, two love-birds on Titanic, and criticize this well written story about Ajla and Danijel. My point is, Angelina Jolie proved herself as a great director and producer, and others who say otherwise are just not happy with this film because it touches one serious matter that is still going on in Bosnia, even though the war is over."
"ausryte12","10","102","326","20 January 2012"," Excellent movie about destructive power of war
","I recently saw this movie and was really surprised to see how low rated it is on IMDb. I think most reviewers forget that this movie is not a documentary about the history of conflicts in former Yugoslavia (e.g., blaming A. Jolie for supporting Bosnian side). It is a drama about war and its destructive power revealed through a love story of two people. The movie raises many interesting questions and attempts to address many difficult issues (e.g., sexual violence against women during war, which, in fact, was used by Serbian armed forces on unprecedented scale). It is extremely difficult to objectively depict any conflict and especially an ethnic one, but I doubt that this was what A. Jolie aimed for. I had mixed feelings about watching this film, but it exceeded all expectations. It is rather violent, but probably still far from what a real war looks like."

","I try to write this in Serbian as the rest of the world, led by Angelina, can not understand what happened here, but IMDb did not allowed. So I just put in translator and there it is: Earlier I was always disgusting to see the organization as Women in Black to 10 years after the war and still whine and seek revenge, I could not understand them. Then I looked at this film and I could not understand the character played by Serbedzija and that 50 years after the war, itching for revenge. And then it hit me, I can not understand them because I did not lose anybody in the First World War, nor the second nor the wars in the 90's. I was ""lucky"" that my parents have died from the disease, so I just blamed the doctors. But what if that someone, a neighbor, someone who speaks my language, killed my father, mother, brother ...? How should I bring, would the hatred grew in me to death? That's why I can not condemn anyone who has lost someone in these wars. Neither the Serbs nor Croats or muslims. Do not reproach me, but a Muslim to write a small letter because it is religion, Bosniak or Bosnian or Herzegovinian in capital. We are not christians, the muslims can not comment, I do not know enough their faith, but we are no longer christians because they do not know how to forgive. None of us. Angelina is not even, as in this, really a very thin film, there is no forgiveness, only vengeance and empty love. True love is much greater than this in the film, and if Ms. Jolie love this embodiment, it is unfortunate Brad with her. The film is thin, the story is shallow, the brutality is not nearly so much what was in reality the performance is good considering the bad dialogue and an empty script. Realistically I do not understand what was Serbedzija doing in this film, hi is the great actor size of the other, headed by the director. The political background of the recording and use of this film is not worth talking about, but it should look, to see how others see us, and how we look.

"nerminbajich","10","26","73","5 March 2012"," excellent movie
","Unfortunately Serbian propaganda animated all Serbs to vote and to give negative vote for this movie. Actually thru events shown in the movie are even scarier. Movie shows who is real aggressor in the Bosnian war. SERBIA IS AGGRESSOR, and on top of that still not punished for the crimes committed in Bosnia during 92-95 war. On the Milosevic trial prosecutor office made a deal with Serbia and they denied to present evidence to Bosnian side who sued Serbia for Genocide not only in Srebrenica but in entire Bosnia. Serbian propaganda now days is trying to make all sides equally guilty for the war in Bosnia. I just hope that people will believe more their own eyes and what they saw on CNN, BBC during that time then to Serbian propaganda. Let it be known that there is still Republic of Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina, ethnically cleaned from all Bosniaks and Croats. World and Europe tolerate that state of insanity. This is why everyone should see this movie. Movie may be graphic, but the real war is even more graphic, and if no one tells the story how it really was, then people forget. I would ask all, especially westerners to first see the movie and then to vote. I sincerely think that this movie deserves more attention."

I watched the movie last night and did not realize she was the director. I only caught her name at the end of the movie. I say good for her. She took a horrific war and added a love story to make people pay attention. I have high hopes she will continue her work and teach us more. She is a passionate Female that knows what she wants.

","Spoiler Alerts: This movie is a very sad. Everyone that watches this has to realize that ANY film that shows brutal rapes, murders and war scenes is going to be hard to watch. This film is no different....but I feel that Angelina Jolie did a fantastic directing job because you are seeing so much of the points of view from the women. I don't think a lot of you like that, but I do. I think it is fabulous to watch a war movie from a womens perspective!!! Congrats Angelina....I loved it and I stayed awake!! Not very many war movies keep my attention. This one did, it was made smart. It may not be correct from costumes standpoint but it feels real and if you do not know any better it seems real."
"enisaz","10","67","214","13 February 2012"," Remarkably accurate. A truly outstanding movie.
","This movie tells the painfully true story, which has not quite been told. The story of torture and of systematic rape during the Bosnian war. The story is not easy to tell, especially in a short movie, but Jolie proves to be an incredibly skillful first time director. What I especially liked, is that at the end of the movie, we see that Ajla, one of the protagonists, is not just an innocent Bosniak girl in love with her captor; the audience gets a glimpse of Ajla's hatred for the man she is portrayed as having a love relationship with, through the entire movie. <br/><br/>Angelina has been stating in interviews that she never intended to direct a movie, when she decided to learn more about the Bosnian war. What she learned had affected her deeply, as it should be the case for any human being, and it really shows in how well the movie depicts the story. In an incredibly thoughtful way, Jolie selected the cast of new and celebrity actors, mainly of Serbian ethnic origin, with whom she worked closely in creating the movie and representing the story of the war. Nearly everyone has heard of the war in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian Muslims. It was being documented on the front line news as it was happening, with the world not intervening, as had been the case with Rawanda, and later Sudan. However the details of the horrific torture and rape, still remain under-reported. <br/><br/>I work as a medical doctor in Canada, where I completed my medical education. Today, while seeing a consult in the hospital where I work, I happened to see a young patient whose mother and father had both been in separate concentration camps in Bosnia, the Serbian militia run camps. Her mother, a Bosnian Croat, was there, with the patient. She told me about suffering of post-traumatic stress disorder for many years, and of years of ineffective therapy, including Etc. Of watching her husband, a Muslim, suffer, until suddenly falling ill and dying of cancer recently; he had refused any mental health care or pharmacological treatment here in Canada, for his psychological trauma. She spoke about how they were forced on buses,of what happened to the rest of her family, as if it had just happened yesterday. She only mentioned that she had lived through horror, it was all in response to my question of whether there was any family history of mental health issues. I had just recently seen ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"", and as this woman was speaking to me, I almost told her about having watched the movie made about her story. Of course, I could not say something like that. This woman was weeping as she talked about her life. She seemed to get lost in that past, as she talked.<br/><br/>It made me think of how sad it is, for these people who have been uprooted, having lived in a rural Bosnian town for generations, and coming here to where there would be peace, but where they would never find peace. They came here not knowing anybody, in a strange new land, not being able to speak the language, and unable to use the skills they had been able to make living on, back in Bosnia. <br/><br/>I then saw these reviews and was saddened to see how the Serbian extremists are still vocal. Although there still exist Nazis and skinheads, the Holocoust has been acknowledged long ago,and not only officially, by the German people. This happened soon after the WWII. When, and will this ever be the case with the Serbian population at large? <br/><br/>In the movie, the Bosnian Muslims are often referred to as "" the Turks"", a derogatory label, by the Serbian soldiers. Bosnian people are not descendants of the Ottoman Turks, although, personally, being of Bosniak ethnicity, I would have nothing against having Turkish roots, or for that matter,roots of any other origin. There was no motive for this war, or for the ethnic cleansing that went on, aside from the sheer hatred, cruelty and the crazed nationalism and extremism. From a rational perspective, it would have made more sense if the Serbs had started killing random Turkish citizens in Turkey, to avenge having to live under the Ottoman empire rule for centuries. Of course, as absurd as this sounds it would make more sense. The only crime of the the Bosnian Muslims victims is that they were Muslim. And, yes, the principal victims of the war and the ethnic cleansing were the Bosnian Muslims, of whom at least 100, 000 were killed (though the figure is often minimized), but also millions exiled and uprooted. It is untrue and absurd to say that ethnic cleansing "" was committed by all sides"", as some reviewers here claim. It is not difficult to understand and know this. It is impressive, that of all people, Angelina Jolie, has made this important movie, and told the hardly believable, but true story of Bosnian women's war experience."
"naiarazz","8","19","51","16 April 2012"," I like it
","I like it as a woman. I have new found respect for Jolie for having the gut to tackle this subject while most people refuse to learn about this war or finding it too hard to stomach. I also enjoy its artistic presentation. It is not perfect but the movie is beautifully filmed and the acting is great. Kudo for Jolie taking the effort to make the film in 2 different language versions.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of foreign films and I find the Bosnian version of the film with English subtitle easily comprehensible. I wish the character development is more extensive and the plot is more convincing but overall I like the film none the less because of its bold style and impressionable result. The movie provokes me to think about the roles of wars, religions, and human nature in our history. The box office is only 300k while the budget for the film is 13 million. I wonder if there is a conspiracy to block it from greater theatrical release."

","Very impressed about Angelina Joly's work. First war movie I see since long with deep sensitivity, very loyal to the feeling we had in Europe about this war. For those looking for typical Hollywood special effects, pass your way, you will not like it. This movie speaks to our hearts and souls. It shows the strength of a woman capable of love, even in the worst situation. It shows how unbearable war is even for men, how it destroys those who are doing it, and not only their 'victims'. The portrait painted by the main character at the end of the movie says it all: eyes circled with deep blue coulour expressing the depth of a loving person, not naive, not a 'victim' either, witnessing the atrocity of war between artificially separated brothers and sisters in the name of politics and religion. Even the differences between men and women are smoothed, not showed as usual. There is nothing 'standard' in this movie, that's probably why it doesn't satisfy those seeking for usual patterns. Well done Angelina, I was not expecting anything like that from you! A real good piece of Art"
"ricardo-f-trindade","10","17","45","3 January 2013"," Great movie
","This is one of the best movies I watched about Bosnian war. It is viewed from the side of Muslim Bosnians but tries to ""understand"" the Serbian side. The movie doesn't try to be an historical or factual movie. In fact, it leads you to a state where you can think about the human race actions. Why we do those things? There's no simple explanation. You are motivated to do some kind of things now that will make no sense a minute later. You react by impulse, by the influence of the others. That's in my opinion the main goal and the conclusion about this movie. If you'll try to obtain a justification for those actions, you can eventually find one but which will be a reflex of some other and so on.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of violence but this was the cruel war, wasn't it?"

","It is beyond me how ignorant and vile some people can be. There is nothing ""fake"" and ""exaggerated"" about the pain and suffering of these women. For some of the people who wrote the reviews, this movie is ""unfair"" and ""one-sided"". Well...""sorry"" BUT they should have thought of that before they committed genocide, and before they started supporting war criminals and turning them into heroes, before they started (and still do) denying an exploiting other people's pain and sorrow. None of these scenes of rape are fake; all the brutality is not even shown. This is not just another Hollywood movie; this is as real as real gets. What is unfair to me is that people are denying an ethnic cleansing and a genocide (one that has been pretty well documented as a matter of fact)! What is appalling to me me is the the lack of decency and humanity from certain groups and individuals to murder over 200, 000 people, rape over 20, 000 women, use of gas chambers, massive graves, burning people alive, throwing babies into trash trucks, making innocent people drink their own urine, and so many more horrors. What are you thinking? How selfish and inhumane can you be? I would never in a million years deny other people's pain or belittle it, and sure as heck I would NEVER call those who committed these horrors my ""heroes"" and ""innocent people"". At the end, no matter what these ignorant murderers and idiots say, I know what I lived through and the terrors I survived and the injustice my people went through. Until my last moments of life, I will tell the truth. For every grain of hate and lie you spread, I will use my energy to educate others of what happened and peacefully fight that it never happens to anyone else regardless of religion, race, gender, etc. ""First they came for the communists, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.<br/><br/>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.<br/><br/>Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.<br/><br/>Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me."" -Pastor Martin NiemÃ¶ller"

People on Balkan will never be able to live together after this!<br/><br/>If you doubt the review, spend 30 minute of your life to see a small part of what actually happened, Serbia need to accept that this was genocide and take the hit for that!

Ignore all the poor reviews thus far - I did, and did not regret it! For those who have seen Hotel Rwanda and the Last King of Scotland, and enjoyed the historical basis of these films, this movie will be another welcome addition to their watch list.

"zachmalsch","10","8","18","20 October 2013"," Did we watch the same movie?
","First of all before I go on I want to recommend you watch the movie in it's original language of Bosnian (and I believe it includes some Serbian and Croatian.) I'm not really sure how that works but (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_language) did a nice job of explaining it. So once again I think its very important for everyone to realize that my review is only talking about the version in Bosnian. So as far as the acting went I thought it was excellent and they all seemed very believable. With the subtitles in English their accents all seemed good to me. Now of course the story line doesn't change in a different language but I can't really go into it too much since I don't want to include any spoilers. I guess all I have to say is this, it's definitely not a formula movie. If you go in expecting it to be like the typical movie you watch you won't enjoy it. Just go in with an open mind. Of course I am biased as I personally enjoy non-formula movies that are willing to take a risk. but I think there is a lot of symbolism in the movie and I think it isn't afraid to try and address some real issues that are going on. People say the story line is disjointed but I think it all ties together nicely at the end. I personally compare it to movies like There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men. Now I would say those two are better movies but the styles are similar. Now there's clearly a lot of people who would disagree with me but I felt like that was why I should write a review supporting it.

It is a true story that Angelina Jolie's first movie isn't the greatest of all times, but it ain't so bad as it is represented. Yes, I come from Bosnia and I will try to be as objective as possible, during this review. This movie can be looked from three sides: Bosnian, Serbian and a neutral side. It is not just a movie, so I could review its story, special effects, acting. No. It is more then a movie. It is an attempt (successful or not, doesn't matter) from one of the greatest film star today to show what happened in Bosnia, so the world could see what really happened. And the storyline, no matter what you think, where you are from and what do you believe, shows what happened in Bosnia. I really watched some good war movies. And unfortunately, some very bad ones. For this one, no matter how hard I try, I can not say if it is good or bad as a movie, 'couse I am watching it from the perspective of a Bosnian, whose nation suffered in this war. Serbs will think it is a big lie, Bosnian will awake memories of these hard times and raise this movie to the sky, the neutral ones will watch it probably because Angelina Jolie signs it. This shouldn't be treated as a movie, not in the usual way. If treated so, for a neutral viewer, it is nothing. It is just an unspectacular love story between a soldier and his victim. Nobody can see this movie as a Bosnian does. I've visited the theatre and saw people who were left without words, who just said at the end of movie: ""I don't know what to say."", ""What a movie!"", people, especially some women secretly cried...But you can not escape the truth... It brings up memories... Sadly, those trying to be forgotten. Maybe 10 stars are too much, but personally, I would give this movie a 100. A 1000 if possible. It made me think about everything that happened here whileI was just a little baby. And why my mum still today, cries sometimes when talking about what happened in the war. To make a very, very long story short - watch this movie. Not because it is the greatest movie of all times. Not because Angelina Jolie wrote the scenario. Not because it is sad and people are getting killed. Watch it so you understand what happened here. Watch it and understand why 17 years after the war Bosnia can't work as a normal country. And all because we don't accept differences. Just as this movie shows. Angelina, thanks. Great job done. Greetings from Bosnia, the land of blood and honey..."

","For those of you who are wondering whether this is a good film or a bad film, you can't judge it that way. This is a fictional film about a very real situation that happened in the Croation / Serbian / Balkan Regions in the 90's. Most Americans know nothing of the horrors that went on during this time period because American Media and Popular World media gave it very little coverage at best, but mostly no coverage at all of what was really happening.<br/><br/>This is about the genocide in the Bosnian / Serb War. It depicts many points of view, form a Muslim's POV to A Serb's POV and many POV's in between. Serbians feared that Muslims were taking over leadership and with the help of Propaganda fueled a hatred of Muslims in the region. It was very similar to what happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany. Neighbors and friends turned on each other. Lovers and Families were ripped apart. Women in captivity were raped and killed, children slaughtered; and the World pretty much ignored the whole situation.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie learned of the conflict and researched into it and was horrified by what happened and how it was not something the media seemed to care about. She wanted to tell a story to make people aware of it, but she wanted it to be true and heartfelt.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a Muslim Woman and a conservative Serbian Army Commander and His Father and the conflict and it does jump around and give you different perspectives. It unflinchingly looks a rape of captive women in times of conflict. It's not your typical blockbuster action packed thrill ride, or your ""chick flick"" romantic type movie......it's an emotional roller coaster of love, hate, politics, religion, genocide, shame, guilt, pain and loss.<br/><br/>If you find history boring or fictionalized stories interwoven with true events tedious, then you will hate this film. But if you are interested in something you may not know much about, this film is a great introduction and insight into the happenings during this war. It will most likely make you want to research more about it, dig at the truth and the aftermath. This movie is haunting and beautiful and disturbing and dark....it's not going to be everyone's idea of a good film, but in my opinion it was fantastic!"
"vedadku","10","54","175","16 February 2012"," Very good Job
","As I see here, many of the Serbs are posting reviews and they probably never saw the movie. There are no false statements in this movie. Actually what they said and showed in this movie is only a small percentage (around 15%) of what Serbs actually did in this war. When you actually meet those people and women who lost their loved ones and were in camps, you may have a different picture of the war. Just a fact is that there was 500 mass graves found on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina until recently and about 3000 single graves from Killed Bosnians. I will not speak any more about this sensible subject because the movie is great if you understand it. <br/><br/>The movie is a movie, so it should be considered as a movie and not a documentary. She did put many different aspects of torture and killings, but not nearly enough to show what really happened in this war and how many victims were there. Let me say that the movie is about a couple who were together before the war and when the war started, it was love because he kept her safe in the camp and he was not a killer. He did not shoot anyone and he did not want to kill. That is why she loved him as well. Later, when he started killing and torturing people, she lost her love for him while he still loved her. Later she was only using him because she became a spy for a group of Bosnians (her sister as well)telling them each move that Serbs make. Bosnians were in an area where the Serbs were and it was only a matter of time until they were found and killed. To me, this story is about a territory similar to Foca, but in the movie it says Sarajevo. Still she changed data because it is a movie and it fits better into her playing. It is a logical movie, and people will probably have to see it at least two times to get it. <br/><br/>Great movie overall.<br/><br/>And there is a English version for USA."

It is a difficult movie to watch, and it doesn't help that the cast is foreign, movie is not in English and reviews are misleading because there are so many negative reviews coming from Serbians (they really need to come to terms with crimes their countrymen did and cool off).<br/><br/>This was a very ambitious debut for Jolie and I really think she pulled it off well above any expectations. The movie is powerful, emotional human drama with some great war action scenes.

","On acting. Howard Feinstein said in his review for Daily Screen that ""... one selling point could be the foregrounding of an outstanding portrayal of a Bosnian Serb camp commander and civilian cop, Danijel, by the Bosnian Serb actor Goran Kostic, despite the sometimes ludicrous plot situations into which he is thrust. His physical agility, soft but masculine face, piercing blue eyes, and remarkable capacity to shift moods in a split second recall a younger Ralph Fiennes..."" I respectfully disagree. Even assuming that some of the plot situations are ludicrous, I think that Kostic makes them even more ludicrous by his remarkably unconvincing performance. It didn't really matter whether he was hanging out with his comrades, developing his supposedly amorous relationship with Ajla, which in reality is nothing more than sexual slavery, or just being an obedient son to his bigoted father who happens to be the army general, it was flat and extremely lame, even on the most basic level of making it believable to the viewer. Now, even if Jolie the scriptwriter intended to emasculate the camp commander and empower the victim, which I think she did, he sabotaged it all the way. I failed to detect shifts in his moods from the moments when he was recreating the bygone times pretending to love and protect her to those when he hated her guts simply for not being of his own kind or for suspecting her loyalty. For me, Kostic's portrayal of Danijel's split-second transformation from a seemingly protective and affectionate to selfish and outright aggressive self in his dealings with Ajla, his alternatively authoritative and submissive personality in the rapport with his men and his father respectively is just pathetic. Yet, nowhere is his hugely unimpressive performance more exposed than in the movie's final scene, which, to be fair to Howard, is lost on the foreign viewer watching the English version of the film or the one in the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian language with English subtitles. Finally, if any of the lead actors in this movie deserves praise for outstanding portrayal of her character, it is Zana Marjanovic, who, similarly to Natasa Petrovic in another recent movie on the subject of sexual violence during the war, Juanita Wilson's As If I Am Not There, delivers a solid performance. If these two movies, and Tanovic's Circus Columbia with Jelena Stupljanin in it, are anything to go by, young female acting talent in the Balkans is much superior and seems to be ahead of the game compared to their male colleagues. <br/><br/>On insistence on sticking to historical facts on film. Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds is a good example. Responding to the critics who slammed the movie as trivialization of Holocaust, shallow propaganda, caricature of a gruesome war, the movie that promotes terrorism and torture, a fantasy that, if it were to be indulged at the expense of the truth of history, would be the most inglorious bastardization of all, Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Simon Wisenthal Center said: ""Jews have to recognize that Hollywood is in the entertainment business, and they have a right to entertain their audience. It's presumptuous for us to become the czars that tell the entertainment community what kinds of films they can make."" Tarantino for his part said: ""I'm telling you it's fairy tale right at the top... Whoever gets it, gets it: whoever doesn't, I don't give a damn."" Yet, in spite of it being a fantasy, a fairy tale that starts off with once upon a time, it is more than just that, at least judging by the experience of actors who participated in the making of this movie. Melanie Laurent, French actress who plays the character of Shosanna described her experience in the following words: ""I'm Jewish. I read the script together with my grandfather and he told me: 'You have to make that movie, please.' So, it was not just for me, it was for my family. And when he (Tarantino) picked me, I'm the face of the Jewish vengeance. I'm sure my grandfather will love the movie.""<br/><br/>On resistance to giving a human face to the enemy. Giving human face to suicide bombers on the screen did not win Hany Abu-Assad, the director of 2005 film Paradise Now many fans. On the contrary, he was faced with a barrage of attacks from day one of the filming. During the filming one of the Palestinian factions acted on a rumor that the movie was anti-suicide bombers and they kidnapped the movie's local location manager and demanded that the film's crew leave Nablus. Owing to the movie's huge success, Golden Globe award and Oscar nomination in the best foreign film category, critiques started coming from the other side of the border too. In her comment on the supposedly anti-Semitic character of the film Irit Linor wrote: ""... And so we can rightly call 'Paradise Now' a Nazi film: it spins a thin thread of understanding for those who resorted to desperate measures to solve the problem of the constant, unremitting evil of the Jews..."" Fed up with these and similar attacks coming from both camps, in response to the question about the message he wanted to communicate through this film. Hany Abu-Assad said: ""I don't have messages in movies, messages I leave for the postman."" <br/><br/>A concluding thought. For starters, it would be good if we could at least try and see these movies, regardless of whether they are brilliant or flawed, more from the artistic point of view, more as a human thing. The alternative is to wonder why Lubna Azabal's character Suha in Paradise Now did not speak with a Palestinian accent, why Cristoph Waltz's Jew Hunter in Inglorious Basterds is a multidimensional character who speaks several languages, or why those sniping and shelling the city of Sarajevo in In the Land of Blood and Honey had to have such evil grins on their faces."

","I haven't watched the whole movie yet (for me it wasn't that easy to do so at once) so I thought it would be helpful to check some reviews first. There are so many comments on Bosnian war and few information on the movie itself ( I didn't bother to read them all). Anyway, I actually found these comments funny and somewhat absurd at the same time. The fact that I'm reading ""historical facts"" about my country and a war was kind of confusing. At some points I wondered if it is Bosnia and Herzegovina people talked about. Too many facts about history, traditions and nationalities one should know to be able to comment that perspective of the movie. Watch the movie instead, from your point of view, as a human being, without choosing sides and if nothing else then bear this message in your minds: that war was as brutal and violent as it is shown but something like that could happen to anyone. You will always find some background historical story in each country that could cause that physical and emotional suffering we've been through.You should also understand that there are still some people out there forgotten by the rest of the world as we were in 90's. This is where I come to conclusion that from what I have seen so far Angie sent out the messages we've been served from movie industry for a long time, only choosing the different settings and unfortunately non-fictional story."

Obviously the love story was made up, but it gave a different dynamic which I liked. To see how torn they were being with each other, how they were to deal with carrying out the relationship after they were abruptly forced into opposite sides. I do not know much about the Bosnian War, but I'm glad I watched this film. Makes me want to read up on it to see what all went on.

And this is a truly brave film, and I think an honest and affecting film, that I hope everyone will have the opportunity to see. This film is not about the condemnation of one or another group of people, this film is about the human poverty that war and ethnic hatred visits on all who come in come in contact with it.

That is shame but only shows how important and how good this movie is.<br/><br/>Also, some reviewer criticized scene of bombing bar as disconnection or absurdity in script. That was regular scene these days, just remember of Markale (market in Sarajevo) massacre when people were buying regularly at the market and got massacred by Serbs' bombs.

","This film has one wrapped tight from the first frame. Any film depicting a true conflict has a certain power, but its limits are defined by the mastery of the film making. Jolie does a splendid job here in maintaining a balance between the atrocities of war and the tenderness of humanity. My only complaint is with the title. Bosnia is not well-known as a producer of honey. At least some mention in the film of honey production would've made sense in the context of the film's title. Not only was there not a scene of honey production, the filmmaker missed a great opportunity for a profound allegory...one simply made by connecting the story to the title. A little nit-picky, I know, but it would have made a significant difference in the film's emotional impact."

","The movie is a love story but at the same time it is the first realistic war move from the war in Bosnia. Serbs did a lot of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia (fortunately they ware stopped when the same thing was tried in Kosovo; NATO said stop or we will destroy you. I still remember bombs falling all over Serbia). But nothing was done to stop it in Bosnia. One of the ways ethic cleansing was done by Serbs was to have rape camps where solders would systematically rape women and this is where a lot of the storyline is happening. The ethnic cleansing is a difficult subject to talk about and a lot of Serbs are angry because of this movie so only somebody form outside could actually make a move like this and that somebody is of course Angelina Jolie. I would recommend this move to anybody as it shows what was happening in middle of Europe less than twenty years ago, while the world looked the other way."

"MovieCriticMarvelfan","10","123","437","23 December 2011"," Impressive film by Angelina Jolie
","I was invited to see this film back in July. At the time it was a secret screening. They wouldn't tell us the name of the movie, let alone who directed it. When I find out later it was directed by Angelina Jolie , I was impressed.<br/><br/>She did a great job capturing the atrocities of war and the lowest depths of humanity here. The movie basically shows us the events leading to, during, and after the Bosnian war from the perspective of a Serb and a Bosnian who as it so happens are lovers.<br/><br/>The lovers are Ajla and Danijel both excellently played by Goran Kostic and Zana Marjanovic . At first Danijel is very hesitant about carrying his orders as a Serb soldier. At first, but this doesn't last long. He either carries out or orders other members of his team to carry some barbaric actions on the Bosnian civilians they find from either rape, torture, to eventual death.<br/><br/>When you see what happens you are going instantly think back to the Nazi's and what they did to Jews in the name of ethnic cleansing.<br/><br/>Eventually, we see through Danijel's lead, genocide being committed at every turn. Ajla is captured, but she is treated like royalty (again at first) with no one else being able to touch or come near here except Danijel.<br/><br/>This love story though has no happy ending as Ajla sees Danijel for what he is, not an unwilling participant in the war, but an active and willing agitator in one of the most chronicled bloodbaths recorded in Europe.<br/><br/>""In the land of Blood and Honey"" is a superb war movie showing the type of atrocities that the Serbs were accused off while the United Nations and United States did nothing to stop it until the end.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie's second directorial debut is impressive. No shot is ever wasted, every shot and scene sets up something very important. The actors are all excellent.<br/><br/>This could easily get several Academy nominations come Oscar time.<br/><br/>All in war a very brutal, but realistic depiction of another bloody war in history."
"ferguson-6","7","100","350","11 January 2012"," Criminal War
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Bosnian War is not something most Americans know much about. The cursory western media coverage was matched by the hands-off approach from the UN, until the very end. This movie doesn't shy away from exposing the atrocities of ethnic cleansing and genocide that occurred against civilians. The comparisons to Nazi war camps are inescapable.<br/><br/>This is no place for a history lesson, and I would certainly not be the one to supply it, but some basics are required to somewhat understand what's going on. The reign of Yugoslavian President Tito lasted until his death in 1980. Although much criticism is directed his way, he was able to maintain a society that allowed the co-existence of Bosniak Muslims and Orthodox Serbs. You might recall that in 1984, Sarajevo hosted the Winter Olympics. Not long after that, the republics began skirmishes that eventually escalated to a complicated civil war lasting from 1992-95 (The Bosnian War).<br/><br/>The film makes no attempt to capture the full scope of the war, instead choosing a microscopic approach by focusing on two people. Danijel (Goran Kostic) and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic) are dancing cozily in a club when a bomb shatters their date and their lives. Danijel goes on to become a mid-level military leader of the Serbs, while Ajla and her Muslim family and friends are torn apart, some even executed. Ajla ends up as a prisoner at the camp Danijel commands. He manages to protect her from the brutal rapes by soldiers by staking a claim on her and putting the order out that she is not to be touched.<br/><br/>Ajla is an artist and Danijel is a soldier and their earlier dance evolves into a psychological battle of wits, mistrust and escape. Danijel is clearly not of the mindset to be a brutal killer within a war, yet Ajla constantly observes his every movement and even the slightest change in his approach to her and the war. She does what she needs to survive and he uses her as an escape from the atrocities of his day job. The end result of this relationship is both shocking and inevitable.<br/><br/>Danijel's father, Nebojsa, is a senior level military leader who shows up in time to provide us with a brief history lesson dating back 600 years. He takes much pride in the Serbs ability to persevere. Nebojsa is played by Rade Serbedzija, whom many will recognize as the villain from The Saint (1997) and Boris the Blade in Snatch (2000). This is a powerful and frightening character, and we quickly understand why he doubts his son's fortitude. When he finds out about Ajla, we immediately know things are going to get ugly.<br/><br/>After the screening, we were fortunate enough to have a discussion panel sponsored by the World Affairs Council. One of the panel members was a former officer in the Bosnian Army who spent time in two separate concentration camps. Viewing the film was very emotional for him and he said it captured the realities as well as a movie possibly could. Of course, we never lose sight of the fact that what we see on screen are not ""real"" bullets, not ""real"" rape, and not ""real"" blood.<br/><br/>Purposefully held to the end of my comments is the announcement that the film is written, directed and produced by Angelina Jolie. We are aware of her humanitarian efforts and here she works diligently to tell a story that exposes the realities of war and how humanity can disappear. It's not a perfect film (it runs a bit long), but it tells a powerful story that many of us prefer to pretend doesn't exist. As with the Bosnia and Herzegovina citizens, we can't help but wonder what took NATO forces so long to get involved. Capped by an understated and haunting Gabriel Yared score, the film is tough to watch, but also a brutal reminder that war is the ultimate sacrifice and punishment for real people and real families."

I heard a lot about this movie before I went to see it, and I was afraid that it would be a disaster, but it was not, it was a movie that showed the horrors of war and a lot of separate crimes that were every day life for Muslim people in Bosnia. You hear about those things, you know that it is true, but your brain cannot picture it. Angelina Jolie within those two hours installed brutal pictures and painful facial expressions in my mind. I understand that many people complained about one side of the story. The fact is that Serbian military was bombing Sarajevo for three years, the fact is that there were snipers shooting civilians, the fact is that all the horrors depicted in this movie took place in Europe in plain sight to the whole world. It is true that there were crimes committed by Muslims and Croatians, but it was not the story here, maybe some other movie.

"gradyharp","7","25","75","25 February 2012"," A Very Dark and Controversial Movie
","THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY is stirring a lot of controversy, both bad and good. This is actress Angelina Jolie's first outing as writer/director of a film and for many reasons she deserves applause for tackling such a subject as the Balkan War from 1992 - 1995. Unless the viewer has studied the conditions in the once Yugoslavia, a bit of history may help the view to understand the conflict. 'In 1992, conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between local Bosniaks and Croats backed by Zagreb, and Serbs backed by the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbia. The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. Opposed to the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces, the JNA attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. This did not succeed in persuading people not to vote and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence. On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out. The conflict, typified by the siege of Sarajevo and Srebrenica, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. Bosnia's Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist Radovan Karadzi promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority- Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadzic pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through genocide and forced removal of Bosniak populations. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants. Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia. In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed Operation Maestral to push back Bosnian Serb military gains.Together with NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, the successes on the ground put pressure on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after Operation Flash and Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had managed to reclaim all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East bordering Serbia, however most of the Serbian population in these areas had become refugees, and these operations have led to war crimes indictments by the ICTY against elements of the Croat military leadership. The areas uncaptured by the Croations forces in ""Sector East"" came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement on the 14 December 1995, with the formation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina being the resolution for Bosnian Serb demands.<br/><br/>From this background Jolie has fashioned a story that relates a strange love story that is difficult to define. Danijel (Goran Kosti) and Ajla (Zana Marjanovi), rare in a dance hall when the explosive war begins Danijel is a a Serbian policeman, becomes a captain, and Muslim artist Ajla becomes a captive. When Ajla ends up in Danijel's camp, he attempts to protect her without attracting undue attention, so she serves the men meals, but the threat of rape is ever present. Danijel's father Nebojsa (Rade ÂŠerbedzija) is the general of the Serbs and discovers that his son is hiding a Muslim woman, discovers her, has her tortured, and condemns his son. Lack of trust between the 'lovers' leads to a tumultuous end.<br/><br/>The script is slow, the movement slower, but the impact of the bestiality of war, once again based on religion, demonstrates how cruel people can become when it is Serbs against Muslims, even when the individuals are lovers. The point is made, perhaps too repeatedly, but Jolie has assembled a fine cast and manages to give us as raw a picture of war and the camps always associated with the captured ones as can be shown on the screen. It is a necessary subject to examine: t is not an easy film to watch. Why is it controversial? The answer lies in why is war controversial - who 'wins' when all lose? <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

And I did my research and like in every all sides did crimes one more then the other(I only consider real sources like the International Court of Justice) but a previous crime will never justify revenge like many stated in their reviews(They did this or that to us...)We have courts for such things so do it like humans not like animals because that is the only right way.Mladic,Oric,Milosevic,Gotovina and etc. have something in common they are war criminals anyone who thinks that any of them is a hero is just stupid because they killed innocent people because of nothing.And they are criminals because a court made such a decision based on real facts and not based on some propaganda."
"mataney","10","61","208","29 January 2012"," Angelina Jolie's ""Dogville"" taped over Central Europe.
","Angelina Jolie movie is a very important cinematic piece, yet to the casual viewer who just wants to spend few hours of mindless entertainment, this may be a piece with lots of heavy lifting. The premises of the movie are based on fragments of war-time stories. Most of them come from Sarajevo neighborhood of Grbavica, which was the closest part of the downtown Sarajevo area held by Serbs. Stories about militia terror are not ""historical inaccuracies"". They are accurate. Just to mention one name from the real life - Veselin Vlahovic. This is man who committed wide-spread atrocities and is indicted for death of at least 27 people whose families are willing to come and witness in front of the court. His specialty was taking helpless and hapless victims out of their homes to houses converted into prisons or simply sites with graves dough out where he would threaten to murder them and either collect all of their money or commit the crimes. But he is not the exception, he is just very famous, vile and took exceptional enjoyment in carrying out this task. <br/><br/>The story of rape is very important in Bosnia which is still very closed society. In this society, there is no greater shame for a woman then to be raped. Some of rape victims were held imprisioned long enough to be more then 6 months pregnant, then discharged, unable to abort the children of their rapist. Just imagine the convoluted mind that would organize and orchestrate such injustice on to anyone, I do not care what you cultural of belief system is. And this is just what has been done. There are women in Bosnia, single-parent mothers who are raising their children, father by rapist who never have even been brought to the justice. The reasons are too numerous -> most women did not want to get exposed, some were tired of constant uphill battles and legal quagmire, the other ones just came to accept what has happened and chose to only move forward and not dwell on the past. <br/><br/>The most disappointing part of Serbian government perpetuated, organized and orchestrated crimes is widely disseminated propaganda that Serbian views and Serbian story was not heard. Only nationalism dominated and uneducated mind can think that what has happened and what has been documented, not in Angelina Jolie's movie, in Hague War Criminal Tribunal, in books written by Ed Vulliamy (""Season's in Hell) or Bill Carter (Fools Rush in, Story of war and redemption), is somehow unilateral. Serbs need to find a way of how to cope with the crimes they committed from 1991-2001. Because, the greatest crime was to sentence their children to bear the same burden which lead them nowhere, except to the bottom of European economy for blatant ignorance of 21st century human rights. <br/><br/>Among the human rights, there is a right to love and be loved. This movie is a portrayal of how love can be consumed by hate, and how war can turn something loving and benign, into something vile and malignant. This is as deep as a war has ever gotten. <br/><br/>This movie will not leave you feeling good. It has no happy ending. But it's a story that should have been heard much earlier then 2012. To get involved in such a heavy and political movies as director's debut, Angelina Jolie has utmost credit and can only be admired for effort to make a movie which is not going to be Hollywood blockbuster, but rather a story of suffering, asking from viewers for empathy. Nothing more, then to feel what these people went through. I know that most resonant question after seen the movie will be - did this happen to anyone. And answer is - yes. And, not only were woman raped. Man were raped as well, but compared to woman, raping a man was an act of submission, raping a woman was an act of embarrassed. Most of women raped were never able to get over emotional aspect and have been scarred for their life. And most of them do not talk, not even to their significant others, especially if they met after the war. <br/><br/>I know most of you come to IMDb to decide if you should see this movie or not. If you know next to nothing about foreign policy and don't care to be burdened, it's okay. This movie has a low rating, not because it's bad but because it has been reviewed by some Serbian chauvinist who have taken a special task to slender it. The other votes are from people who are used to being spoon-fed in movie theaters. If you do not know where Yugoslavia is, who Serbs, Bosnian and Croats are, it's OK. It's complicated. But do your own homework, then come and see a movie. One thing I will promise is - you will be moved, disturbed and shaken. The reminder is the work of conscious and empathy. <br/><br/>I work in ICU and deal with human trauma and sickness everyday. And this movie made me cry. Cry for deep hurt inflicted on random people, just because there was no system to protect them from thugs and goons. Thank you Angelina and never mind Serb nationalist and their reviews.

THIS IS NOT TRUE. This is NOT a one sided view of the war. THIS IS A VERY VERY VERY GOOD representation what happened during the SIEGE OF SARAJEVO. She is not trying to cover the entire war, but the SIEGE OF SARAJEVO and the mistreatment of women. All of that did happen during the war.. Stop flooding this website with skewed and primitive personal beliefs of what happened during the Balkans wars, this MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT THAT. This movie is about Sarajevo during the war, and it is just absolutely ridiculous to deny any of the mentioned in the movie, we all know it happened.. <br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed watching the movie, even though I thought that the acting could have been somewhat better. The storyline has some good and unexpected twists, and it leaves you attentive throughout the entire movie. Thumbs up for that. For a first timer I thought Angelina did a very good job, and the characters in the movie had a very good emotional vs rational vs compulsory feelings conflict representation. Good job Angelina, hopefully this primitive behavior of Balkaners in these comments won't discourage your activism in this field.<br/><br/>Cheers"

Angelina may have choose sides, but this is HOW WE SEE THIS WAR. this is how we really think it happened, no only in Bosnia, but in Croatia as well. and finally someone has shown it to the world. Maybe this is a bit incorrect from the historic side. Like which guns they used or how did they uniforms look.To me that is irrelevant.This movie has a greater purpose. And that is to show the world what we have been through. That did the Serbs did to us, and to Bosnians, and that mission has been fully completed."

","If a story is good, the movie is good, and this movie is very well-written and very absorbing. I am tired of Spielberg-like movies that pretty up war, like the recent War Horse and the older Saving Private Ryan This movie gets in your face about war and its ugliness and horrid justifications, and it also brought up facts about the Bosnian war I never knew. This world went into denial over this war, and thanks to movies like this, we can see and maybe own that neglect. It did NOT make the Serbs into monsters, and that current protest from the Serbian population is just plain silly. War makes us monsters, I don't care if we are standing in the trenches or staying at home in front of the TV rooting for ""our boys."" It's all evil, and thanks to Angelina and her bravery in making this movie, we got to see that and there are two reasons we have war: money and vengeance. The Muslims mistreated the Serbs, the Serbs get back at them, it keeps going back and forth forever. That was Jolie's point. She gave us both sides. So if you are nit-picking over the wrong uniforms and other minor details in this movie, you are missing the point. <br/><br/>I would say this is a great first attempt at directing, but I think it is just plain great directing, first or not first.

The movie is based on a romance from the war, and not about the war in general so therefore I don't believe it was one sided. If Angelina Jolie decided to make a movie about everything from the war then the movie would be very different. Everyone from the war had their share, we all know that. The movie isn't to teach about the war, it is a story told from the war. The actors did a great job in portraying all emotions. I like that Angelina Jolie used actors who experienced the war themselves. Loved the plot. I would recommend this movie for sure.

There weren't many spoken words but the visuals entranced and kept my eyes essentially glued to the screen.<br/><br/>I criticize some of the user reviews that state that Jolie did not know her material that well or the history. She spent time doing research before filming as well was working with crew and actors/actresses that lived through that time period and or had close ties.

"Tyler-Raine","8","96","349","16 January 2012"," Powerful and Relentless- A Solid Debut for Jolie
","""In the Land of Blood & Honey"" is powerful, brutal, and relentless. I knew going in this was going to be harsh and I imagine it would have been even more hard hitting had I not read a couple reviews before. The performances from the leads were very strong. And yes, it was a basically one sided portrayal of the conflict. Serbs were generally shown as villains- I wouldn't say ""evil""- but they were shown as clear aggressors, with agendas to cleanse Bosnia of Muslims (though there were individuals shown to have mixed feelings about this tactic). There is some dialogue that tried to give justification for things like the Srebrenica Massacre (""these Muslims killed xxx amount of Serb civilians last week, we're going to make them pay now"" etc), but it would have been more effective if it was shown rather than said- so I do think the film could have shown how the Serbs also suffered in the war but it didn't.<br/><br/>With that said it's hard to argue that these atrocities didn't happen- rape camps, genocide, and the like. And this movie was cold and brutal in its depiction of it. Like all war movies, it shows the conflict through the perspective of a few characters- namely Muslim Aijla, her Serbian lover/soldier Danjiel, and her sister. It showed how all of their lives get torn apart as a result and it was uncomfortable to watch, though very well done for a directorial debut- and for a low budget film it certainly had admirable production values and some well done war scenes. The relationship at the center was twisted- a cat and mouse ""forbidden love"" story that didn't have a chance despite the couple's efforts.<br/><br/>Jolie's script and characters are not perfect, and there is some dialogue that was a little clunky and clearly for the benefit of the general audience who didn't know much about the history of the conflict, but even so it's still a confusing issue to follow. Ultimately, like I had expected, I don't think it served so much to blame Serbians for the war but rather the West and their non-intervention for so long. And it is disturbing to think that all this was going on in Europe just in the last decade, a half hour from Italy. It doesn't quit until the very end and the end is gut wrenching just like the rest of the movie. Rather than focusing on small things to nitpick, I believe Jolie should be commended for a truly astonishing debut feature that brings light to a tragedy that has been severely overlooked- it was largely ignored while it was happening and now, 20 years later, is largely forgotten.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"neximuss","10","28","88","26 February 2012"," A good view from inside out
","I really didn't expect that Angelina Jolie is capable to understand the problematic of the Serbian hatred to the Bosniaks, but I was wrong and that's good so. It is clearly a one-sided view of the war conflict, but from that angle you couldn't do a lot of mistakes, because Bosniaks were the sheep which were slaughtered.<br/><br/>I use the term ""sheep"" on purpose, because the problem of the Bosniaks is forgiving and forgetting. This was the 13th massacre (genocide) on the Bosniaks in the history, but they didn't learn much from that. There is an non-translatable word in Bosnian called ""merhamet"" which means something like altruism in forgiving.<br/><br/>Merhamet is a adjective of almost all Muslim nations, but Bosnian are giving it a insane dimension, which can also be seen in one of the scenes in the movie, where the Chetniks are taking Muslim women as life-shields to capture a house with bosnian soldiers. The chetniks are calculating and saying it out loud that the Bosnian soldiers won't shoot on them, so they rather die then try to escape in such situation. So Bosniaks aren't able to take and make victims to defend themselves and rather use ""merhamet"" and hope for paradise for such act.<br/><br/>So it's all about merhamet. A nation without any merhamet (Serbs) and Bosniaks with too much merhamet. That's the thing I didn't imagine in my dreams that Jolie is able to get, but she did and I congratulate her! ps. the votes on IMDb are influenced by a Serb vote action against the movie, so the rating isn't a public picture, it became a political issue on the Balkans."
"garfild71","10","15","42","22 March 2012"," The truth is a much worse then this.
","The term Bosnian Genocide refers to either the genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica in 1995 or the ethnic cleansing campaign that took place throughout areas controlled by the Bosnian Serb Army during the 1992–1995 Bosnian War.Over the next several years, Bosnian Serb forces, with the backing of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army, targeted both Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) and Croatian civilians for atrocious crimes resulting in the deaths of some 100,000 people (80 percent Bosniak) by 1995. It was the worst act of genocide since the Nazi regime's destruction of some 6 million European Jews during World War II.The events in Srebrenica in 1995 included the killing of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims as well as the mass expulsion of another 25,000–30,000 Bosnian Muslims, in and around the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, committed by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić. The ethnic cleansing campaign that took place throughout areas controlled by the Bosnian Serb Army targeted Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. The ethnic cleansing campaign included unlawful confinement, murder, rape, sexual assault, torture, beating, robbery and inhumane treatment of civilians; the targeting of political leaders, intellectuals and professionals; the unlawful deportation and transfer of civilians; the unlawful shelling of civilians; the unlawful appropriation and plunder of real and personal property; the destruction of homes and businesses; and the destruction of places of worship.In the 1990s, several authorities, along with a considerable number of legal scholars, asserted that ethnic cleansing as carried out by elements of the Bosnian Serb army was genocide.[5] These included a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly and three convictions for genocide in German courts, (the convictions were based upon a wider interpretation of genocide than that used by international courts).[6] In 2005, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring that ""the Serbian policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing meet the terms defining genocide"""
"macmirce","10","50","174","12 February 2012"," Nice Jolie
","Films about the state of affairs in the former Yugoslavia made by the people who lived through the times before, during, and after the breakup of that country have what I have termed a savage whimsy to them. The blackest of humor permeates even the most horrific situations (Danis Tanovic's NO MAN'S LAND comes to mind), black humor that has arisen from the defiant spark of rebellion rather than resignation about the hopeless mess that life can be. Angelina Jolie's not unimpressive feature film directorial debut, IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY, lacks that sophistication. However, it does a fine job of setting forth with a stark lack of sentiment the crimes against humanity that were perpetrated during the war that broke out in that region in the early 1990s. Jolie's is a lean direction, with a fine eye for evocative composition and a blistering sense of outrage cloaked equally well in the tension of shocked silence an in the expected wails of anguish.<br/><br/>The writing, also done by Jolie, is less effective. The best way to consider a script that abounds with the convenient coincidences found here is as an allegory, and the characters who people those coincidences as symbols, particularly towards the end, where the action takes place in a blindingly white room that smacks of either limbo or purgatory. On this level, it is moderately successful. The lovers at the center of the story Ajla and Danijel, sum up between them the ethnic and religious divides that the war encompassed. She's a Muslim, he's a Serb, and theymeet on the last night of peace in Sarajevo. He the handsome police officer who spies her across a crowded club dance floor, she the beauty waiting to be swept off her feet. They dance, they nuzzle, and when the bomb goes off signaling the start of hostilities, they both minister to the wounded. Several months later, she has been arrested and he is one of the officers where she is detained. She and the other women serve and service the soldiers in ways calculated to dehumanize them. Danijel offers courtesy and respect, albeit only in private, as well as a gentle courtship that is at odds with the brutal rapes to which the other women are subjected and which Jolie depicts with an intimate intensity that gives no quarter to the audience.<br/><br/>The conversations, between the lovers and others, by contrast, are barely concealed dialectics on moral relativity, though the actors involved, Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic, pour their hearts and souls into the performances as each tries to justify their feelings for each other and for what their people are doing to each other. Danijel is the well-meaning villain of the piece, standing silently as others do evil and being slowly changed by his passive acceptance of what is happening, and by his inability to cross his father, a general and symbol of knee-jerk jingoism with a hatred for Muslims that stretches back 600 years and is fueled by atrocities committed within his own lifetime.<br/><br/>As the years go by, the bodies of the dead pile up, the abstract becomes the personal, and the living are reduced to their religion, ethnicity, politics, or anything but their basic humanity. IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY ultimately becomes a string of teachable moments, as a good allegory should be, and told, also as an allegory should be. with images that burrow into the psyche with a calculated artistry."

","I am frankly appalled by some of the negative reviews this film has received. The acting is excellent, the direction and production values are of high quality, and the story is indeed one-sided. Don't you think Ms. Jolie was entirely aware of this when she made the film? All that has happened here is that she has adopted a certain viewpoint and portrayed this on film, rather well actually. Yes there were atrocities on all sides (she does not say there weren't, in fact these are discussed in some of the dialogue). That is not the point; this movie is about a love affair between a Serbian man and a Bosnian Muslim woman, and the inner battles both of them go through knowing what is happening around them. He spends most of the movie trying to protect her, while she spends most of the movie either scared out of her wits, or just plain nervous.<br/><br/>Some people are dismissing the movie because it is only showing one side of the conflict. I believe Ms. Jolie's reaction is that she has nothing to be ashamed of, because that is how she believes things were. They probably were (all over the region, with differing perpetrators).

","Like most Americans, I hadn't known an awful lot about the former Yugoslavia before it broke up after the dictator died; I hadn't even known there was a big Muslim population there. When the ""ethnic cleansing"" was going on in the 1990's (that was the origin of that term, if I recall right) I marveled how a supposedly civilized world could still let all this horrible crap happen, but at least there were discussions what to do about it, which was more attention than the slaughter in Africa was getting around the same time. I remember at one point some women in Sarajevo put on a beauty contest to lure TV cameras to their situation, with a big banner reading PLEASE DON'T LET THEM KILL US. I sometimes wonder how many of them did survive.<br/><br/>Actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie has put specific human faces on this nasty story. For her directorial debut she has reworked the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" story with apparently a big influence from Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" (certainly well worth emulating). Before the hostilities commence, we see a Bosnian Muslim painter and a Serb soldier on a date in a nightclub; Jolie lets the scene play out a la Michael Cimino with the wedding sequence in ""The Deer Hunter,"" ending with a bomb blast completely out of the blue a la ""Children of Men."" There's a jump forward and now the couple are forced into being enemies. To her credit, Jolie depicts the ensuing atrocities mostly from the victims' perspective, most of the victims being female. The painter endures her lot with stark stoicism, knowing a display of weakness would just invite more abuse. Some of the abuse is ""just"" psychological or even childish, as when a bunch of troops eating at a table keep dropping things on the floor for her to clean up. The panoply of man's inhumanity to woman is all the more compelling for being understated. Eventually the soldier stashes the painter in a house for her protection but finds himself torn by conflicting influences. The outcome was a real jolt for me, but in hindsight it should have seemed inevitable, so hats off to Jolie on both points. Wars pass and we forget body counts but I suspect I'll remember that woman's face for a long time. I'll also remember the moments of tenderness and even humor that Jolie allows us, which seems almost like mirages in the unrelenting desert of cruelty that's depicted.<br/><br/>Those seeking more of a ""back story,"" a geopolitical examination of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, may be disappointed. We're just asked to accept the situation as it's presented to us. I think, though, that Jolie was right to stick to the story she wanted to tell rather than include scenes of UN negotiations or whatever. (The blue-helmeted ""peace keepers"" only appear briefly and ineffectually at the end, maybe that was Jolie's little editorial dig.) All the cast members are effective; I only recognized the guy who played ""Boris the Blade"" in ""Snatch."" The photography is that bleakly elegant kind so popular in modern war movies. I don't usually remember soundtracks afterward, but this one was very effective, maybe I'll try to get the CD. Available currently for $4.99 on Comcast on Demand, definitely worth a look. I understand that Jolie filmed this both in English and the local language at the same time; I saw the English version, would have preferred the local language with subtitles, but I know having to read those is torture for many Yanks. By the way, Hollywood studios used that multi-language technique a lot in the early days of talkies, making their actors do multiple movies for the price of one. Now that a silent flick has won the Oscar, I guess we can expect more such blasts from the past..."

The movie is cruel, and some scenes were pretty awful and hard to watch, but so was the war and it had to be shown that way. I disagree with people saying movie is against the Serbs-movie was made from Bosnian point of view, and if people there experienced it so, so it should be. People in the movie, are ordinary people dragged in the hell of war, with their worries and problems- best example is Danijel's Serbian friend, who's wife is pregnant, and he had to go to war. But he believes this war is fought so their children won't have to fight. We can also see in some scenes, how Muslim people fight back and kill Serbian civilians. The romantic story doesn't seem so strange, and their confusion is well shown through the film.Ajla cannot accept what others are doing to her people,and yet she likes Danijel, and Danijel is torn between his father, Ajla and current situation. The ending is the only ending I could find believable after this story. Don't miss it!"

","It begins in the spring of 1992. A young artist named Ajla (Zana  Marjanović) makes herself pretty for her boyfriend, a cop named Danijel  (Goran Kostić), who she meets up with at an intimate nightclub in  Sarajevo. At this point, we know virtually nothing about them, apart  from the fact that they're in love. But as the music slows and the two  embrace for a romantic dance, a bomb destroys the club, killing some  and critically wounding others. As far as the plot is concerned, the  Bosnian War has suddenly started. In reality, tensions had been  mounting for years following the economic decline of Yugoslavia, which  acted as a buffer zone between westernized Europe and the Soviet Union.  The 1980 death of President Josip Broz Tito didn't help matters much,  for he was no longer able to maintain the unity he created between the  Bosniaks, the Serbs, and the Croats, the country's three largest  religious and ethnic groups.  At first glance, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" seems to be ignoring  these broad historical facts. But the more we watch scene after scene  of violence and bloodshed, the more we realize that first time  writer/director Angelina Jolie is in fact educating us. It's merely a  question of method; rather than explain the Bosnian War with cold  academic detachment, she instead narrows in and humanizes it. From the  images of shell bombings and gunfights to the human atrocities of  ethnic cleansing and mass rape, we're not spared the horrors of this  conflict. Jolie, well known for her humanitarian efforts, made it a  point to cast actors from the Bosnia and Herzegovina area, allowed them  to speak their native language, and even involved them in the screen  writing process. It's no wonder, then, that this aspect of the story  feels the most authentic.  But the film is equal parts war story and tragic romance, and it's the  latter part that I find myself questioning. In the same narrative  tradition as ""Romeo and Juliet,"" the love story between Ajla and  Danijel is challenged by the opposing ideologies of their respective  peoples. Only after the nightclub bombing and the country's descent  into chaos do we learn that Ajla is a Bosniak and Danijel is a Serb.  Popular opinion dictates that they should hate each other. Not long  after the war starts, Ajla is part of large a group of Bosniak women  arrested and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp; as it so happens, the  place is run by Danijel, now a captain in the Serbian Army. Many of the  women are repeatedly raped, but Ajla, through Danijel's influence, is  left untouched. She is, however, still required to do degrading menial  tasks such as serve the soldiers' food.  As time marches ahead toward 1995, the year the war ended, Ajla and  Danijel will repeatedly reenter each other's lives and assert their  love for one another, albeit under emotionally draining circumstances.  If they wish to continue seeing one another, for example, she must  allow herself to be locked in a cell, presumably to pose as one of his  political prisoners. I grant you, it's a spacious cell, and not too  many prisoners are privileged enough to continue what they love doing   painting, in Ajla's case. But a cell is still a cell; her love does not  grant her any degree of freedom. It certainly does nothing for the  other women being held prisoner, nor does it spare her sister, Lejla  (Vanessa Glodjo), from enduring the greatest pain a woman in her  position will ever know.  As well acted as this subplot is, much of it feels contrived, as if  created solely for the purpose of being dramatic. Having said that,  aspects of it are compelling, none more so than the extent to which  conflict and injustice can traumatize people. As the film progresses,  it becomes increasingly apparent that the bond Ajla and Danijel formed  prior to the war is breaking. At a certain point, it was no longer  clear to me how they truly felt for one another; they both seem torn  between what they once had and the reality of the current situation,  spurred by long-standing ethnic tensions. Danijel in particular is  weak-minded when confronted with his father, the Serbian general  Neboja Vukojević (Rade erbedija), who, following the slaughter of  his family at the hands of the Turks, has absolutely no tolerance for  Muslims. Danijel may not be as impartial as he initially thought.  There's much to admire about ""In the Land of Blood and Honey."" Not too  many first-time directors would have the fortitude to write a  screenplay for a war film, shoot it in distant foreign locations, hire  local actors, and stage elaborate action sequences that require days if  not weeks to prepare. From a technical standpoint, Jolie has risen to  the challenge. She also deserves praise from a historical standpoint,  for she has brought our attention back to a conflict the world in  general has largely forgotten. Amazing such a thing could happen, given  the fact that not even twenty years has passed. From a narrative  standpoint, on the other hand, there's room for improvement. There's  nothing wrong with setting a love story against the backdrop of war,  but there are more convincing ways to go about it."
"sahlawi","8","97","392","26 December 2011"," Not bad Anglena
","Let me start with well done Angelina. This is her first movie, and I think she did well. As a person who is pretty much involved in politics, I found the movie very accurate. I would defiantly say that it was educational as well. There would be no better person to direct such movie and do it better than Angelina, given her work experience in the field. She was looking at the events that took place in the Balkans as an outsider, I would like to say she was the judge, and she decided that the Muslims were the main victims, hence, the movie portrayed that. I liked the part when they briefly explained the one of the grudges that the Serbs and Croats held against the Muslims, I wont share that information of course, as I do not want to spoil the movie. I could hear people in the theater crying and clapping at the same time. I do not think the movie was bias towards any side. Angelina, did portray the good and bad throughout history of each side, and that love is possible under any circumstance."

","I just want to say that the star rating of this film has been rigged. I have received emails from Serb acquaintances to vote 1 star for this film and that's why this film has a huge percentage of 1 star votes.<br/><br/>It seems the Serbs cannot stomach the fact they are portrayed as bad boys in some recent films. To live in denial of the genocide in Srebrenica and the ethnic cleansing that they did in Bosnia-Herzegovina you will of course get upset when you hear the truth.<br/><br/>This film isn't bad as the star rating shows. It has been based on real events and loosely on a true story of a young beautiful Bosniak woman who was kept a prisoner by a Serb soldier, who later fell in love with her...<br/><br/>Angelina added artistic touch and with decent production made a powerful film."
"poppy_78","7","30","106","20 February 2012"," A movie with a message
","This is not a romantic comedy or another pointless movie made simply for entertainment purposes. It's an honest movie with a real message. Sure, it's not the best movie ever made, it may not win many awards or gain public acceptance but t that doesn't matter! So many people talking about how this is not a realistic portrayal of war and war crimes have (thankfully!)never lived through a war, or have experienced ""their"" war being led in a different part of the world (Irak, Afghanistan, Vietnam etc.) War is not something from the movies, it is REAL and of course someone who hasn't REALLY felt it himself cannot comprehend it fully. . Someone before me said ""This woman doesn't need some small country in Balkan to help her popularity"" and i agree. Some says that she is one sided, that she hates Serbs. That's not true. She just picked what story to tell and that is her artistic liberty. Not all Bosnians were good man and not all Serbs were war criminals,some of them were and are great man. But many were monsters during the war and that is the fact! If you can't handle the truth don't watch the movie! If you think love story is too much then go borrow yourself a commentary film! Considering that this war has happened in close history it is tastefully made, with a lot of heart and emotion. If you don't leave the theater moved then really have you any heart at all? All wars are in fact the same - the absence of all good. Let us not be the same, let us remember that even a not so good movie with a brave and strong message is better than a life lived in silence and fear, it's better than forgetting!"

","Great movie, shows the real side of chetniks (serbs) during the war in Bosnia... Makes you sick to see how they were... beasts! It is very hard to watch something like this if you have to do something with the war... However I enjoyed the movie, I personally think that people who have nothing to do with the war there will not completely understand some parts and behavior from both sides... What I really do not like about the movie is that it is standard in English and not in local language (Bosnian). It would give a better dimension and atmosphere to the movie. I know there is a version in Bosnian but the International version is in English, better had the International in Bosnian too... It is sometimes very explicit/harsh, in terms of sexual abuse and violence... May Allah guide the serbs to the good path..."

"Ramascreen","8","87","354","25 December 2011"," Everyone is guilty
","I'd have to somewhat agree with those who think that this is more or  less Angelina Jolie's very own Schindler's List and there's a bit of  Romeo & Juliet element to it as well, and just like the Shakespearean  classic itself, this too is a tragedy. Quite ambitious and daring for a  feature directorial debut but I wasn't completely surprised because  this film came from an Oscar winning actress whose humanitarian work,  especially for this region, has been very passionate. Jolie's future as  a filmmaker looks promising..  Jolie doesn't hold back in her effort to show how brutal the Bosnian  war was. The environment looks authentic and harsh. And just like  Spielberg's 1993 Oscar winning film, IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY  also invests most of its time going into details about the killings and  the disregard for human life. The raping scenes would be uncomfortable  for some to watch. I remember I attended the press screening, it was  already a few minutes into the movie and at the door there was a person  who I thought at first was the studio's rep but then she told me she  was a fellow press member and she was there just to wait until the rape  scene ended so she could then re-enter the room and watch the rest of  the film. Some may argue that this is a one sided story, everybody is  entitled to their opinion, if this was indeed a movie that's pro  Bosnian Muslim or pro Serb, I wouldn't be able to tell because what I  saw was both sides killing each other and none of them was the better.  I think Jolie is just angry at the fact that the international  community did not intervene in time to stop the genocide or the ethnic  cleansing, and that anger is shared by many. This is film is her  showing how bad things can get when good me do nothing. And that's  basically the aim of IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY.  The backdrop is the Bosnian war but right at the heart of the story are  two key characters, Danijel played by a Bosnian Serb actor named Goran  Kostic and the other is Ajla played by a Bosnian named Zana Marjanovic.  They became representations of the two opposing sides and they're both  played by solid actors, Kostic has that arresting presence about him,  he could be sympathetic at one point, because he's stuck between  loyalty to his father and his love for Ajla, but at another point he  could also be distant. Kostic's emotional range is wide and the same  goes with Marjanovic, who is absolutely captivating. At one point she  makes you believe that her character Ajla is the protagonist, at  another point she makes you feel like she may be untrustworthy. It's a  very complicated love story because what those two characters have is  not exactly true love, despite whatever feeling they have for each  other, Danijel badly wanted Ajla to be a Serb and Ajla knows that she's  sleeping with the enemy. The line between the oppressor and the  oppressed gets blurred and everyone is guilty."

I immediately suspected that a lot of reviews were politically motivated, my suspicion was confirmed when I saw the names of the people who gave the review. The names revealed which nationality they are. And the fact that a Repubilka Srpska is banning the movie from showing in theaters is also another confirmation of political motivation. <br/><br/>Some of the reviews are saying that the movie is historically incorrect.

"belmaa_g","10","34","127","16 February 2012"," Angelina, really not bad for the first time..
","First of all, I need to say that there is too much panic about the movie and it's time of happening, which is Balcan war. It's NOT the main subject of the movie and everything shown in it (just a tiny piece of that 3 years) is truth and there is nothing more to discuss. The love story is not completely clear to me and I expected more passion and sacrifice which was not completely shown especially from Ajla's part. That denouement is kinda slappy and could have been done much better I think. I am not sure what Angelina wanted us to think at the end but I assumed she didn't love him at all because she had given him up so easily. I didn't expect happy end, the headshot ending was perfect I must admit. At the end, if we put aside the history and say it is all only a fiction, you can't say that movie is that bad and I can't believe this movie has such a bad rating. Seriously, 7 is perfect."

","I don't have a clear image of what the Bosnian war was or who was right or wrong.The statistics in the end are horrible due to the loss people suffered during & after it.As with all wars I think any rational person would have to ask in the end was it all worth it? So judging this movie based solely on accuracy in regards to historical fact & consideration is nearly impossible unless you were there. I was not there & I am not a historian by any means. Now filmmakers have been retelling some of the most brutal & historic atrocities for a very long time from various angles & perspectives to a wide & varied degree. So my question is is it wrong to to look at these types of films as purely entertainment? For me personally I think its safer to go into a historical drama with this mindset & if the movie is done well than maybe it can lead you to explore the truth a little further once the credits have rolled.In the Land of Blood & Honey does just that for me.Again I cant account for accuracy but I was moved & entertained & captivated & angered throughout the duration of this movie.I think In the Land of Blood & Honey is a tough film to review but I still felt compelled to write & say give it a shot & form your own opinion."

"maurice_yacowar","8","5","13","29 November 2014"," Serb-Bosnia war shatters a romance, a country and the lovers' souls
","Perhaps if this film had not been written and directed by the beautiful Angelina Jolie it would be recognized as one of the great war films. Its distinctive focus is the victimization of women in war. An end title tells us 50,000 women were raped in the Bosnian war. In the title's variation on the Promised Land, the phrase 'milk and honey' is supplanted by 'blood and honey.' That is, murder replaces sustenance, rape love, betrayal trust, and humanity is supplanted by the murderous machinery of war.<br/><br/>One soldier tells Danijel that his pregnant wife must be delivering a son because a little daughter would drive him mad with doting. In the context his madness would have a different source: her doom to become another victim of a soldier's rape.<br/><br/>The larger theme is the pervasiveness of division. The first shot is an aerial view of the landscape, A slash of river divides the Serbs and Bosnians. The people get along well enough to enjoy a dance together, where the Bosnian Moslem Ajla charmingly connects with the Serb soldier Danijel. Their promising romance is interrupted when a bomb shatters the club.<br/><br/>When they next meet Ajla is a prisoner and Danijel the camp commander. That power gap inhibits both their attraction, until her humiliation drives them together. The tender eroticism of their first lovemaking derives from the refuge each finds in the other, she from the other Serb soldiers' brutality and he from the callousness of his job, personified by his father the general. Even Danijel's protection fails when he is transferred to Sarajevo. <br/><br/>They are reunited when she, having escaped the first camp, falls in with the Bosnian underground and agrees to let herself be captured to enable her comrades to get at Danijel, now more murderous than his father. Their lovemaking turns wild from Danijel's doubting her. <br/><br/>The division of that promising romantic couple gives way to the division within each character. Danijel is torn between his love for her and his father's hatred of the Bosnians, for what they have done to the Serbs. Ajla overcomes her emotions for Danijel to avenge the Serbs' murder of her infant nephew. So neither a passionate love nor a driven character's mission can survive the division by war.<br/><br/>In her first scene Ajla is painting a self-portrait, in relatively naturalistic style. At the end we see her final self-portrait, a more expressionistic one in which she seems to have imposed her own splotchy image on the portrait Danijel's father ordered her to make of him, before he ordered her rape by another brute soldier. In this painting Ajla tries to expunge the general and her lover. Her ultimate portrait is what Danijel makes when his bullet to her head leaves an abstract red brushstroke against the canvas of the white wall. Bereft of all his resolve and mission he surrenders to the UN peacekeepers as a war criminal. In another form of self-portraiture Each character discovers him/herself from the tests of the war. <br/><br/>In their night visit to the art gallery Ajla teaches Danijel that in art the most important part is the empty spaces, where the artist decides to do nothing. The war is the something the parties should not be doing. The war discovers the vacancy in both warring parties and the war's emptying of all the people's hearts, whether the respective ethnic communities or the central lovers, both together and alone.<br/><br/>The film should not be judged as a documentary record of this war. As a fiction its thematic sweep covers a larger issue: every war's undermining of nature, humanity, and the positive sustenance of our feminine nature."

But it's a great film, a masterpiece really and should be seen.<br/><br/>The story covers a few years of time starting in the nineties, beginning with the invasion of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbians, greatly aided by the well armed Serbian army.<br/><br/>'Ethnic cleansing' something the Nazi's were committed to in many areas of Europe during WWII, included the Serbian people, something the collective Serbian memory forgot about since they practiced this barbarism as a war policy against the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. (The mass *rape of Muslim women was also initiated as political policy.) The movie touches on these horrors and much more and does so within a fictional framework that seems to be documentary; the highest compliment a movie can achieve. <br/><br/>*One estimate is that 20000 to 50000 women were brutalized."
"bartekn3","9","6","17","5 April 2013"," To all the critics of the movie..
","To all the critics of the movie that are expecting engaging and action-oriented Hollywood glamour, special forces soldiers doing head-shots by a dozen. This movie is about a civil war, not in the ancient times allowing us to make it mythic and heroic, characters becoming black and white. It didn't take place in a distant and exotic country either, a jungle of Vietnam mountains and plains of Afganistan, which would make it easy for ordinary person to distance themselves from the events they see only on TV. It took place less than 20 years ago, probably less than most viewers' age, in the centre of civilized world, among people that lived the same lives we live today. The movie is not about taking sides, being subjective, it's all relative who caused the war, who committed the most horrific atrocities. We say in Europe the region is ""the Balkan kettle"", boiling with emotions, both positive and negative, everyone is to blame for what has happened. It's about a society living in peace, in multicultural and multi-ethnical harmony, suddenly turning against each other. Neighbours suddenly started not trusting each each other, started hating and slaughtering each other. The scene of Serb soldier and Bosnian girl dancing with each other at the beginning symbolizes that. The movie shows the feelings from the past, trust in people, surface and make an attempt to fight all the differences, despite the horrific events around. This attempt fails, the divisions are too great, trust too difficult to build. It can happen to us, you have to see that beyond slow action and lack of fireworks you are used to in war movies. Is it a perfect movie about this conflict? No. But it presents it down to earth, it present the reality of civil war within a society that lived peacefully for over 50 years, suddenly faced with differences that cause them to fight against each other. This movie should be a lesson of humanity to all of us, war is not an entertainment or action film."

It's very smooth and it has a frankness and honesty to it that you would expect from a movie by her.<br/><br/>The movie is a very normal length, especially for a war movie (2 hours). There's not a lot of surprises but it's just a well done movie (again, very similar to Eastwood films). It also has the subtle calm in the film just like Eastwood movies. Maybe it's an actor as a director/producer thing. My criticism is that I wish I had actually learned more about the war and the politics of the situation than I did and that it focused less on the love story.

"radiah-moore","10","8","26","27 April 2012"," Thanks Angelina!
","At least she did care enough to make a movie. During this conflict our parents and the world media did us and the Bosnian people a huge disservice. I was serving in Macedonia in 1999 and still did not know the extent and the horror regarding this issue.<br/><br/>You can complain but since very few English movies have been made about the subject, a large portion of the world still do not understand why this was such a huge deal. <br/><br/>It was my generation, and yet we as a society have not learned from history. Look back at the holocaust and now at Syria. It breaks my heart to realize how this happened and we all had our heads up our tails. I have met some wonderful people from Bosnia who escaped within an inch of their lives, and it hurts me because I cannot even begin to understand how it feels to lose so many loved ones in such a gruesome and horrible way. And how can you ever trust anyone after this? I imagine it's hard to love after that(both to and from). How can you trust when you've seen your own neighbors turn against you...and try to kill you? How can the rest of us have a discussion without shame...knowing we all stood aside and let this happen? The UN seems to have no purpose at all but to buy evil people more time to exterminate thousands of people. And the official casualty count is never even close to the real thing. God help us all. Let's just be glad Ms. Jolie, who is part of my own generation, is standing up for what she cares about. I was only 18, and she was not that far behind me when this all began. It was 1992, and we were in high school, bumping and grinding to ""Boys to Men"" and ""Mary J"" rocking to ""Guns N Roses"". It was the 90s and we all had no clue. It was the same regarding blood diamonds (which is a whole other story but on the same clip board in my mind). I was getting hosed (on several levels) about age 21, when Srebrenica happened. <br/><br/>But the news would not have been much help. It was vague, making most us think that these were just a bunch of folks being kicked out of their homes, a few deaths, a few rapes...no huge ordeal right? Same as everywhere else in the world right? There were no cell phones or IPhones. No wonder we really did not believe it was that bad. Thank god for technology. It's the only reason Syria's people even remotely have a chance. The news networks tried but only now with technology improvements can the real truth get out in real time. I was 25 when I went to Macedonia as part of an Army peace keeping mission. A lot of us wish we should have done something to stop this tragedy. But looking back I was still too young. Our parents were failures and I am afraid we may be too if we do not head. So many children were murdered as well. The kids my age did not have time to get ""hosed"", and party, because they were too busy trying to survive being shot in the head or sent to a camp to be raped, beaten and starved.<br/><br/>The baby-boomers (now very old) have done very little to stop mass murder around the world. They were spoiled by the ""greatest generation"" (our grandparents). And our grandparent's generation was too old to do anything in the 90s. Now here I complain. But Angelina has done a remarkable thing. Those of us from the 90s are doing what we can with the cards we have been dealt and making the best of it. So I hope that the number of deaths do not eventually rise to over 8,000 in Syria.<br/><br/>It's a different situation but it's the same in a lot of ways. I wonder will we be shown as a waist ourselves after the dust settles. We will never understand fully how it felt to be there on the ground trying to survive unless we see it firsthand. And let's hope that does not happen. But we need Bosnians to keep telling their stories and make us feel it. Let us understand your history, because it's all of our history to a certain extent. It only takes one person who holds hatred in his or her heart against one person...then it becomes an entire group that they hate. Then they feel the need to erase that group altogether. I am not speaking for Angelina, but I think she managed to cover those points in the Land of Blood and Honey. I also hope that we move towards referring to people as being of the human race first and this will prevent a lot of war. Also, don't blame Angelina for the lack of realism regarding the uniforms now! Where were the suggestions beforehand to get a more realistic portrayal? And one thing we can be sure of, the romance was as good as it gets in this movie. It will be shown to people around the world and that is what matters. I am doing my best to keep the issue on the minds of all around me. Americans took a lot of flak for being the ""world Police"" after Bosnia, even though we arrived much too late. But we, and the rest of the world, need to forget that and stand up for what's right. RIGHT IS RIGHT NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYES. The UN is only good until the Syrian government ignores it. That has already happened. Let's stop the killing in Syria!!! Many thanks to Angelina for making this beautiful movie, with beautiful actors, and showing us her heart, which I feel is the same as mine. You are beautiful, both inside and out Angelina."
"john32935","3","3","7","31 January 2015"," Movie lacks focus
","Notable as Angelina Jolie's first movie as a director (and also as the screenwriter), this movie fails in many respects.<br/><br/>The movie mainly centers on the life of one woman in the Bosnian war as she is held captive by a soldier who alternately protects her from the severely harsh life as a prisoner and then physically abuses her and kills her kinsmen. Had the movie just focused on this story from her point of view, it may have succeeded. But the movie strays into plot lines of military strategy of the civil war, other prisoners and horrors they face, the politics of the ""outside world"" ignoring the on-going genocide, and more. Each of those could have also been a successful story, but when combined into a single film, we are left with a jumbled mess of a story all the while relentlessly bombarded with Ms. Jolie's message that ""war is bad."" Since the atrocities shown are all performed by one side, it is clear that Ms. Jolie is also lecturing us as to who she believes the bad guys are. While I do not expect a Hollywood movie to be the equivalent of a documentary, since Ms. Jolie intended to show more than just the story of the captive woman, she should have (and easily could have) included a little more balance to the political agenda.<br/><br/>For my other movie reviews, please visit:<br/><br/>https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com"
"stephanlinsenhoff","10","23","101","21 February 2012"," IN the Land of Bal/Honey and Kan/Blood
","During the Bosnian genocide the German newspaper DIE ZEIT reported of raped Bosnian women. And mentioned in a small notice some pages ahead: a child slowly cooked to death in a kettle. A child: for me the emblematic symbol for these and all the other 'bal-kan-years'. A Bosnian woman shared with Ms Jolie her experience. This transformed to a love story - changed to a script for a movie, co-producing with own money and shot in 42 days with a cast of real life survivors from the former Yugoslavia. Them remembering the 'forgotten' trauma (updating Ms Jolies script, one of the nine UNHCR:s goodwill ambassadors). Normals in not normal situations: ethics vs ethnics ... Some do it. Other see it. Awaylooking. The Muslim painter Ajla and the Christian Serbian police Daniel are more than 'Stockholm Syndrome' victims. Details of an evil environment, staging violence for the nothing-doing-audience. In the center the mid-level commander for an internment camp for women and son of a Serbian general, caught by his own history. It started 1992, four months ago: the painter Ajla, working on a picture and babysitting her sisters baby, leaving for an evening at a local nightclub. Encounters Danijel. Then the bomb: and their flirt and to-be-love explodes. The roundup by Serbs, killing the men and taking the women to the internment camp; in charge the Christian Serbian police Danijel. Discovers Ajla among the woman, taking care of her as secret protector, encouraging to escape. Ajla reunites with her sister, part of the rebel forces, planing a counterattack. Captured again. Again protected by Danijel. Escape. And her part as double agent. A lesson what love is when love does not reach beyond the lovers whisper: ""It's a shame you weren't born a Serb."" Their relation is a The Nightporter relation: do anything to survive and wait for the moment of freedom. The side effect of the movie was plain therapy: light-focused the suppressed trauma: go beyond and stop pretending that the past is past and we go on as usual. In the DER SPIEGEL interview Ms Jolie tells that the movie was screened in Washingtons Holocaust Museum: ""Actually we should know everything so much better since a long time back"" (2012/6:106). And at the 12 6 11 press conference the question of what a good soldier is: changed by Ermin Bravo: it is more the question of a good and bad man. And the DER SPIEGEL interview asks Ms Jolie what kind of woman she wants to be? ""What I want to be? A 'great' mother."" (2012/6:106) For this she needs a great father, Ermin Bravos good man. In lacanian terms of No'm du Père (Les non – dupes erent, Seminar 1973/74 march 19): The fathers name exists on the level of speech, unable to authorize himself to speak. It is the (M)other that authorizes him to speak. For this is needed trust. Ajla sees Danijels weakness. He is afraid of his dominant Serbian father, a general. It is this the reason why the movie ends as it ends. She can't trust him. And let him speak. A boy in the soldiers garment of a man. She knows for sure that he has not the courage to stop his father and the soldiers idea of the cooking-of-a-child-to-death. Ms Jolie highlights with her script and movie the Bosnian War trauma. But could have chosen another trauma among the variety of many. It is 1: the question of unwanted vs wanted. The unwanted displaced born wrong among us: Black, Jew, Gay, Gypsy, Disabled and so on and so on. It is 2: the question of the movie is not so much guilt but: SHAME. A taboo forbidden to discuss on stage. Ms Jolies country by birth knew and acted late. As others did, do and will do. Her aim is simple and difficult: highlight shame. Focus what all know but look away. It is easy to lawsuit a crime of guilt. But lawsuit shame, how? Having seen Jews clean the street of Nazislogans, supervised by the SS and looked at by passing, looking, looking away people. Or smelling the gassed and burned disabled at Hadamar: but looking away then and today. Ashamed. This the reason, why the movie is discussed as it is. The line of taboo is crossed: ""But I would do anything for children. Who wouldn't?"" Said by a woman with the wish to be a good mother. The movie, scripted and made for a woman by a woman with women and of course for them who avoid the movie. Occasionally it will be screened at human right gatherings. To show the lack of courage: ""The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence (E Nemert, Sweden, calls it coward) over that by the good people."" Martin Luther King."
"Falconeer","8","6","19","10 January 2013"," Powerful and elegant directorial debut..
","With the release of ""In the Land of Blood & Honey,"" actress Angelina Jolie has proved that she has much more to offer than ""just a pretty face."" She has created an exceptional film about the bloody and horrifying Bosnian war. The film details the struggle of Bosnian Muslims, as they are rounded up, imprisoned, and eventually slaughtered by the Serbian people, still holding a grudge against the Bosnians for injustices done to them during WW2. At the center of this uncomfortably intense film, are two unlikely ""lovers,"" if one can call them that. Ajla, a Bosnian artist, and Danijel, a dedicated Serbian soldier, are thrown together in the middle of a political and religious war zone. Danijel struggles with his feelings for this woman, as they clash with a rabid hatred for her people, hammered into him by his father, a military man on his own personal crusade against people that he sees as less than human. Danijel's conflicting feelings turn him insane with paranoia. If you are expecting melodrama, think again; this film is very ""un Hollywood."" Stark, depressing and realistic, and free of showy, flowery speeches and war scenes. Jolie must be a great admirer of World cinema, as her film is done in this ultra-realistic style. For instance, the overbearing orchestral music that Hollywood films are known to have, is totally absent here. Most scenes play without any orchestral score, and even during the most intense scenes, the music is very low, so as not to distract from what is happening. I was impressed by Jolie's choices throughout. The look of ""Land of Blood & Honey"" is cold, and starkly beautiful. The interior shots are as gloomy and sinister as one would imagine them to be, and the outdoor scenes of snowy landscapes and Eastern block architecture, are haunting and desolate. There are no fake movie sets in this film, and happily, no high profile movie stars to destroy the realism of the production. Jolie made the wise decision to cast local actors, who speak their own language, rather than casting American actors speaking with ludicrous Bosnian/Serbian accents. The two leads were wonderful; Zana Marjanovic was strong and utterly believable as Ajla, and Goran Kostic portrayed Danijel as a man desperately trying to keep his sanity intact, as his father pulls him in one direction and his passion for Ajla, in the opposite. This film has garnered endless controversy over the fact that it has chosen a side, and tells the story from the Bosnian perspective. But this is a movie, and that is the structure of film; the audience needs to have someone to empathize with, as well as a villain to despise. Perhaps Serbian people don't want to be reminded of how some of their people acted during this time, just as many Germans today are uncomfortable with their own history. But this film has been unjustly slammed by people, who claim that it's a bad movie, when that could not be further from the truth. ""In the Land of Blood & Honey"" is an impressive debut, from a woman that is obviously concerned with World issues, and I hope to see Ms. Jolie in the directors chair again."
"bochritas","10","6","19","10 July 2012"," it's a good movie
","I don't care who is fighting whom...... I took me a while to figure it out who was who in the movie and to which ethnic group of former Yugoslavia the main characters belonged. War in general is an awful and cruel business. And civilians are the one who were - are and will suffer the most. I saw this movie not from the political or ethnic point of view I saw the movie about people without ethnicity ...or country. It can happen and it did happen all over the world and still it keeps happening. Soldiers from both sides had guns to defend themselves but civilians had nothing. Another a very good movie about that time in Yugoslavia is ""Savior"" 1998 by Predrag Antonijevic. Bravo Angelina. Good job."
"emily_contact","10","4","11","5 December 2015"," A great film-The other 80% of the world that fights wars like its the middle ages; and the women who suffer for it.
","If I could give this movie more than 10 stars, I would!<br/><br/>Directing: There were a few cuts that could have been better explained, but the direction of the actors, the story, and the well filmed battle scenes were very good. Excellent job from an up-and- coming director like Angelina Jolie! You felt like you were actually in the room with the characters, and I constantly got lost within each character as I watched. The directing style reminded me a lot of ""The Patience Stone"", which is also a war movie centered around an innocent, civilian, Muslim woman. I noted when I had watched ""The Patience Stone"" that it had a very unique, never before seen vibe. This movie instantly struck me as being the same. The directing really pulled you in. <br/><br/>Cast: Amazing! The choice of non-Hollywood actors who actually knew how to act well was just perfect. The casting itself couldn't have been better. They handled their script well, and fit into their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>Story: Super interesting. The film is about an artist who comes from a partisan supporting family, thus has no or very little racial prejudices. The love interest/antagonist comes from a traditional, military serving background. Their personalities are stark opposites. But the ""opposites"" attract and complement idea really makes their relationship believable and enjoyable to watch. This film pulls you into the realities and human cost of war. It also deals with the subject that war is something that changes one's character (or brings it out), and that no side ever really wins. Of course you can win in the political sense-but ultimately every ordinary person pays a high price. It also touches on the issue that a person can be decent, but if they are born into the wrong side, there is no forgiveness or grace. War is not personal but collective, and yet at the same time carries a very personal price. The film surprised me as it had the characteristics of being several types of films at once. In the first third of the movie, it is a gut wrenching, keep you on the edge of your seat war movie. The middle is a love story destined for failure, the last third is a philosophical and psychological thriller. The last third of the movie leaves you with a lot of scenes where you're asking yourself, ""huh?"", but then it's the final scene of the movie that really tells you what this film was all about. It shows the ability of people who would have been ""good"" in a normal life to be war criminals--and how there is no escaping your fate once the cycle of generations has been set in motion. It also gives legitimacy for foreign intervention. There are some battles in life that are far greater than two people, and far greater than one generation. They cannot be resolved by leaving them to work it out. <br/><br/>Cinematography: Again, really good. <br/><br/>So there are a lot of critics of this movie-I can partially understand why.It's not a typical Hollywood movie, i.e. it's not supposed to hand you explanations on a plate or make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside towwards the end. And part of the critique's of this movie are probably because the protagonist is a Croatian Muslim. As a woman, and a foreigner who was completely removed and even a child during when the real war took place: I am able to completely set aside bias, and enjoy the movie for what it is. The bottom line is, regardless of who you support in a war, it is ultimately the women and children who pay a price. They are the true victims. In that sense, this film is not about Muslims vs. Christians: It is about all civilians who are victims of wars. <br/><br/>Extra kudos for the lead character being a woman. I love war movies, but more often then not they are only told from the soldiers' point of view. Very rarely (in fact never), have I seen a war movie with a female protagonist. Besides this, I actually thought the film was well shot, had a great story, and overall was just a great movie. I love it that Angelina Jolie is actually taking her international experience and bringing it to the big screen. Any film that deals with the topic of war from the real-life standpoint is a movie that needs to be made in our life time. War is a terrible thing. A lot of wars happening are in parts of the world that people do not really understand. The inhumane treatment, rape and routine killing of civilians by soldiers is something underrated in common Western mindset."
"MovieJunkie1976","8","4","11","2 August 2015"," The times they are a changing..
","I caught this title at Redbox recently. Wow the male reaction to this film is fascinating. I have always enjoyed how film produces some of the purest emotional reactions from individuals at the most interesting times. In the Land of Blood and Honey seems to be one of these films. as a film it has exposed something that has not or should very shortly be registering in the film arena. The female point of view muted until the recent technological boom , is now coming to sound. <br/><br/>I am sorry guys , while I have no apologies , and enjoyed being the beneficiary of such implements , I like the rest of us live in the 21st century. The arguments used for keeping film production a male controlled instrument , are moot in the internet age. Angelina Jolie was probably being cautious in her responses to criticism of her film , but I believe you heard a script.<br/><br/>The Statements that the military uniforms were incorrect are fine and pass as well upon scrutiny , the groups were not as well organized as military historical examination proves. The comment that Director Angelina Jolie got into a subject well over her head are crap. folks , lets get to it.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie filmed a movie about war and rape and did it from the female point of view unapologetically. Not being concerned with the Male opinion. What is good for the goose is likewise for the gander. This has gotten it's negative reaction for one reason only. The refusal of the public at large to recognize that A. movies are personal and are often a biased product of their writer , for a direct male comparison to this film see Fahrenheit 911. and B. Hollywood and the production of film are changing to be accessible to the internal whimsy of both sexes. Not hammed over for men if need be. <br/><br/>When you stop hemming over the film traditionalist/feminist politics surrounding this film and accept the female point of view this was clearly filmed in , it is a good work.<br/><br/>So in brief why 4 of 5 , factoring the above in the correct lens , I find that Writing and Direction pass , I believe Angelina Jolie wrote what she intended to and filmed it marginally well ( the technical errors of uniforms etc.. are correct), the actors acted the script well in fact I thought better that expected. the editing was average , I was actually left feeling a little flat if the objective was to paint a dark canvas around the subject. The flow was well put together no real issues in the sore arse department.<br/><br/>It was in this war that rape and the act of rape were finally recognized as an inhumane offense(A War crime), not just criminal behavior. I am in fact certain that rape has occurred in previous wars regularly. but really?? Something this base to the female persona undergoes a direct cultural modification of massive change , and one I'm certain had been politically desired for how long by this group? I'm supposed to get all up in a fuss because a woman put it in the terms of a woman on film.<br/><br/>You know if Micheal Moore can do it about Bush. Angelina Jolie can do it about rape."

Moreover this was Directed by Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Well the story of the movie revolves around a Serbian soldier and his love affair with a Bosnian Women. I felt the movie with its drama and simple story was very good. Whether the events were actual or not, it did show that even such war crimes were very possible considering the fact that this war took place in early 1990's.<br/><br/>For me this has been a good watch and a great movie, in spite of all the negative vibe around the movie's rating. <br/><br/>This definitely earns a 8/10."

Watch this film and forget about politics,forget about religious or sectarian divide,see this film for what it is trying to convey, human emotions and how people are affected by war and the atrocities that invariably come with it. The conflict depicted in the film could be taking place in many countries throughout the world today but little is done soon enough to stop or hinder the perpetrators from carrying out such inhumane deeds. The film is not without it's faults but as a directorial début it was delivered cleverly and yet in some ways quite naively. Hats off to Miss Jolie for taking on such a subject as this and delivering a thought provoking and hard hitting piece of cinema. I for one thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to the director's future projects."
"psysword","10","8","30","28 May 2012"," An excellent movie
","Hi there, saw the movie without reading any prejudiced reviews, and then i was shocked to read the reviews on IMDb. Wow, I see everyone whining about the story, direction, uniforms, medals, etc, etc. But are we all missing the point here? Serbs killed and Muslims died. How hard is that narrative to grasp? Now Angelina is way too classy to portray events in a simplistic manner. Instead she tries to imbue this movie with a surreal romance which is quite convincing. The Serb plays his part wonderfully well, and Alja is simply sensational. I figure that most of these negative reviews written are by opposing Serbs or by uninvolved Westerners. Anyone with an emotional stake in the story of Bosnia will see that Angelina has captured the story beautifully in that short amount of time. The Serbs and the Muslims are shown in their roles quite well. The only part missing was the Bosnian Army, kicking Serbian ass by the time the Dayton accords were signed. In fact the Serbs are shown to be opposing the Dayton accords; however the accords saved the Serbs from a Muslim outright victory. I was actually quite unhappy the way Clinton stepped in to stop Bosnia from being declared an Islamic state, with an 80 percent Muslim population. Hypocrisy and underhandedness keeps Bosnia still on the boil and Angelina has done a marvelous job. Well done darling! A brave Human indeed!"
"johnmartindj","8","7","27","22 May 2012"," Excellent
","This is a very powerful and important film. I know why there are so many bad reviews. It too hard for people to accept that we have not progressed as a humanity since the Nazis caused the most unbelievable atrocities in this century. Too many reviewers on this site refuse to accept that 50,000 women were raped and ethnic cleansing means killing every living soul one at a time until a final solution is achieved. Everyone should be forced to watch this film. Only through knowledge is there a hope that we will not keep repeating our failures. The story is well told and the characters are real. The Serbs side is told by the father of a sympathetic commander. He has been filled with hatred for Muslims since WW2 killed many of his loved ones and he is out for revenge as all the Serbs are taught to hate. I have seen so many World War 2 movies and we have been taught that it won't happen again and here we see it happening again. It is brutal, painful and real. How could we have allowed this to happen in our lifetime. How could the U.S. have claimed not ""to have a dog in this fight?"" The cinematography was art, the direction was clear and the acting was heart warming and believable. One reviewer wrote that the cinematography was ""too bright"" when showing so many rape scenes which would have better shot in the dark. Close your eyes if you want dark, this film is designed to open your eyes and let you see the reality and brutality of war. The goal is to shake you into never supporting war again. It succeeds. I don't care if the director is a famous Hollywood actress or an unknown, she did what she set out to do. Bravo."
"drrodrigohermida","7","4","13","4 April 2015"," still hurts too many...
","I hesitated before seeing this movie. In general I do not like movies that show too horrors of war, not because I want to ignore the darkest moments of human history, but because usually I try to make the movie business a more pleasant experience. That said ... not too convinced I saw the movie. Obviously tells a story from the point of view that the director decided. Maybe many in Serbia do not like it looks for them, but unfortunately, what it shows is what happened. The findings of mass graves, the stories of mass rapes, concentration camps, snipers, ethnic cleansings, etc show what the world knows (or has been known as discovering more horrors). However, the director has the obvious right to tell the story that comes to mind from her the point of view. If the Serbs do not like, then make their own movie showing Muslims as evil. From the cinematographic point of view, it is not the most brilliant film of the century, but also to give it 1 or 2 star or say it's the worst movie in the world? Please! Perhaps so many negative reviews it has is because it gave a key ... really says something then."

Enough about Angelina...and lets talk about the movie. It showed lack of continuity during the scenes and a more involving storyline that had to be a better script, the struggle to keep it in one piece shows the lack of experience. Now to the critics of this movie. First of all there is no such thing about being one sided movie or two sided...is that the truth or not? the world know it is, why bother lying to get it in a political view and confuse the audience about movie. Its sad and painful what happened over there, this movie wants to show it, trying to deny it is even more sad and painful. Its like watching Schindler's List and someone commenting that is a one sided movie...not showing the SS killed by the Jews in the ghetto during the Raid...its disgusting !

","I was pleasantly surprised with the film wholly, and I am a tough cookie to crack when it come to films. My preference is not to do subtitles, but this time it took no convincing once the film had started.<br/><br/>The story line has the viewer gripped, the actors show an incredible depth in grappling all the emotion required to play the difficult parts, and the directing is gritty and pulls the viewer in. The film did not veer away from its story line, nor slow down, and confidently strong enough to draw the audience in to consider and delve deeper into the story and the characters themselves. The haunting artist flair and the beauty of the film was simply phenomenal. It's been a while since I have seen a film of such depth and appeal."
"socialmedia-437-956449","7","4","19","31 July 2012"," An Impressive Debut
","In her first venture behind the camera, Angelina Jolie has written and directed a searing, bold and compelling drama following the experiences of one Bosnian woman and her Serbian lover during the devastating Balkan conflicts of the 1990s.<br/><br/>Days before the outbreak of war, Danijel (Goran Kostic) and Ajla (Zana Marjanociv) meet at a nightclub in Sarajevo. As the music slows, Danijel takes Ajla into his arms and the rest of the party seems to melt into the background. Suddenly a bomb explodes, ripping through the club and burying the revelers under the rubble: this is the first of many explosions that will shatter their lives, and their country.<br/><br/>The next time the lovers meet is in a prison camp where Danijel, a Serbian officer, is overseeing the servitude and physical abuse of a group of Bosnian women. He does his best to protect Ajla from the oppression of his fellow officers, secretly continuing their relationship and employing her as his personal painter. As Danijel struggles to reconcile his nationalist devotion with the atrocities being committed in its name, Ajla must decide if she will use her relationship with Danijel to assist the plight of the Bosnian resistance.<br/><br/>The cinematic and logistical demands of making a film like 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' would be a massive undertaking for any filmmaker, never mind a first time writer/director. On top of a very tight budget and political controversies that threatened the film's production the film was shot twice, once in native languages, and once in English. In spite of all of these challenges, Jolie's film is controlled, authentic and brave, with a hurried and frantic direction that matches the chaotic nature of the world on screen. In The Land of Blood and Honey marks the arrival of a very real filmmaking talent in Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>However, the film's successes will also be its commercial downfall. When portraying the civilian experience during times of war, particularly times of genocide, the approach of many filmmakers is to offer a glimpse of hope in the darkness: the heroic humanism of Schindler's List or Hotel Rwanda, or the doting, protective parentage of Life is Beautiful. Jolie has not opted for this approach, instead exposing her characters to the full onslaught of terror that really took place, with little hope of relief or redemption. While Ajla is protected for a while, this only serves to heighten and prolong her (and our) exposure to the systematic murder and sexual abuse that was taking place in her country.<br/><br/>While this may be artistically laudable, it makes for very uncomfortable and harrowing, even traumatizing viewing. Is this the kind of film that should be made about humanity's darkest hours? That is something that audiences will have to decide for themselves.<br/><br/>Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

The dialog seems a direct translation from the English language and on top it's not accurately portraying the circumstances at the time. 
Shame the film could have done so much more to tell what happened."
"saadgkhan","5","3","13","3 July 2012"," First half is great but falls flat in 2nd half, still recommended!
","In the Land of Blood and Honey – CATCH IT (B-) Angelina Jolie selected the most controversial topic as her directorial debut. A movie about a Bosnian woman falling in love and revenging Serb soldier. From decades there have been many movies about World War I and especially World War II but we rarely see movies about Bosnia War or any war specifically involving Muslims as victims. The Bosnia War is one of the most prejudice wars against Muslims in recent history in which the world just stood there and watched it. They intervened but the damage was already done, Serbs with lesser quantity ruling the Muslim Bosnian territory. The first half of the movie is truly eyes opening it shows how Serbs attacked Bosnian houses, massacred their men and then took their woman to make them as their whores and camps workers. They humiliated the women in front of everyone and treat them as trash. It opens your eyes when you see the humility women have to suffered during the war, not only they lost their men, husbands, children but have to lived as Serbs sex slaves. As the first half is strong the second half is extremely week as it shifts its focus of the war to the love between Serb and the Bosnian woman. In most of the scenes we see them talking and just making love. Maybe Angelina Jolie didn't have much budget to capture the Bosnian movement to suppress the Serbs so she shot second part mostly indoors. Anyways it leads to a disappointing and dull ending. The performances by lead actors are commendable. Zana Marjanovic as the Bosnian woman is great, this role is really tough and required an actress who can pull off. She did a great a job in bold role like this. Goran Kostic as Serb soldier is good but I don't find him that good of an actor to be in lead. I think this made it more like an unattractive pairing and the chemistry is all right between them. On the whole, making a movie about such sensitive subject movie is commendable and I truly wised if Angelina Jolie made the second half as appealing as the first half. Still watch it to understand what Bosnia has gone through during its civil war."
"Radu_A","5","3","15","5 September 2012"," Much ado about nothing, or some better films about war
","This has to be the first time that I see a film just because of the controversy it has incited here on IMDb... and, well, having seen it, I'm wondering: What is all the commotion about? This has all the faults one could expect from an outsider's view. I understand how annoying this must be, but in all its naivety, I find 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' rather too insubstantial to merit concern. After all, there are lots of films from ex-Yugoslavia which deal with the war in a more sophisticated way and have a lot more punch...<br/><br/>'Grbavica' AKA 'Esma's Secret' (2006) dealt with the topic of war rape in a sensitive, understandable and yet unsettling way - and it didn't even pass a blame, it just described a woman's specific story. Jolie's mistake is to try to show rape in all of its brutality, which is highly disrespectful of women who have undergone such a trauma. A more skilled director would have avoided to show the actual fact and leave it to the viewer's imagination - the barrel of a gun is more menacing to see than the bullet in the head.<br/><br/>'Cabaret Balkan' (1998) was a random sequence of episodes happening during one night in Belgrade, with the war never being shown but in a constant, overshadowing presence affecting the lives of all characters. With the stories being so short, the characters' problems had to be interpreted by the viewer. The result was emotional confusion and the realization that there is much to the war that outsiders cannot understand. Jolie's mistake is to focus on one story between two characters, which allows the viewer to find them more and more unconvincing, and dismiss the story.<br/><br/>'Pretty Village Pretty Flame' (1996) dealt with the madness of war between brothers on the terrain of their childhood, and managed to portray all sides in equally disturbing characters. While made in Yugoslavia, it didn't take a one-sided jab at the other war party. Right until the infernal finale, everyone - including a Western journalist - gets to share the blame. Jolie's mistake is to take sides in an ongoing conflict where reconciliation is essential. It's like making a film about the West Bank in which all Israeli soldiers are ruthless killers, or all Palestinians terrorists in disguise. It adds oil to a fire which needs to be extinguished.<br/><br/>'Incendies' (2010) dealt with the personal aftermath of civil war in the guise of a highly stylized personal tale - while avoiding to mention that the country in question was Lebanon. It's a masterpiece because when you watch it, you don't think about war, you think about the leading woman's story, which is so terrible that it gives you a much better understanding of the terror of war than the sight of pillaging and bloodshed. Jolie's mistake was to choose the specific setting of the Yugoslavia war, instead of keeping the location open. She should have shot this with English actors, dealing with a conflict in an imaginary country. That would have been less offensive, and the numerous historical inaccuracies would not have mattered that way.<br/><br/>Still, I cannot dismiss this film completely even though it's a failure in many ways. For any movie which inspires so much ire, and therefore prompts so much discussion, achieves its goal by a different path. In a way, it's a good thing that 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is so bad, because you have to think about WHY it is so bad. And, who knows, maybe it's all intentional, and Jolie in some crazy, artistically suicidal way never intended to pull off a masterpiece, but to have her efforts ripped to pieces as it has indeed been done."
"edib-halilovic","7","4","23","9 July 2012"," True story of Serb acts
","I'm Bosnian and must disagree with some of the comments that the move was one sided. Happenings in this movie are completely based on the facts. For those that do not known, two years ago Bosnian women victims organization reacted on the intend story which was to neutral and was changing the history of what did happened in this region, so some part of happenings had to be adjusted to reflect the reality, mainly Serbs brutality. Great work by Angelina to stand up and defend that this war was not 50 -50. 100% of acts and brutality in this movie are true, I was 13 years old and still remember when we got visit by Serb crew of soldiers and got 24hr ultimatum to live our house or be killed, as showed in the movie. In fact the movie is partly showing human acts by Serbs, the actual happenings were much brutal. Rating: The movie story is solid and gets 7 of 10, which is about the complex love story between Muslim and Serb. The move would have been better if the language used was Bosnian instead of English. The happenings and brutality are completely reflecting the acts done by Serbs, so I have to rate the validity of the movie since to many uneducated people and Serbs are focused on changing the history. You just can't just start war, kill ~100k people, drive out ~2B people, rape, slaughter, hustle and still claim that war was 50-50. Validity of movie is 10 of 10"
"hemchandra22","7","2","9","10 November 2013"," A subtle romance.
","I watched this movie without having read any of the reviews and its reception by the masses and critics, and I cannot be more glad to have done that. Yes, it was indeed a wrong message from the director who went on saying that it is an attempt to reconcile the tension between the two warring parties. However, if one looks at the film from the perspective of Ajla and Danijel, and their twisted, if I could use the word, love, for each other, I think Jolie did an incredible job. For me, the movie scored when only viewed from the angle of Ajla and Danijel, and the Bosnian war serving as the backdrop of their story. I believe both the actors did an incredible job by maintaining the element of being reserved, which highlights the tension that they are going through in their respective lives: Danijel, torn between his love for Ajla and his duty as a son, both to Serbia and his father; and Ajla's character being at loggerheads between her love for Danijel and the revenge motif that plays along. I think it is one of the most subtle romances in recent times. At once where I saw a sort of an imbalance between the two protagonists, with Danijel's character getting projected as a bit outgoing compared to Ajla's act of being restrained throughout, I kind of made peace to the difference as it only hints at the complexity of her character, and her action as we head towards the climax. Amidst all the gory depiction of war and its brutality, I think In The Land Of Blood And Honey emerges as a love-story told in a very subtle manner."
"TxMike","Null","2","9","23 February 2013"," War is ugly, no happy ending here.
","This movie has an unusually low IMDb rating, perhaps because some don't like the political positions of writer/director Angelina Jolie? For that reason mainly I avoided it for a long time but saw it today. War is ugly, no one comes away happy, but this movie provides a glimpse into what it was like. As those who participated in making the movie have said, it is all very realistic.<br/><br/>Most of the actors are native to the area, Serbia, Bosnia, Herzegovina. In fact many of them were children during the subject conflict, almost 4 years from early 1992 through late 1995. It started after former communist Yugoslavia broke up, and the remaining Bosnian area was inhabited by Muslim Bosniaks (44 percent), Orthodox Serbs (31 percent) and Catholic Croats (17 percent), different ethnic groups that had gotten along for years, but now became locked in fierce and deadly battle. This movie focuses on the ethnic cleansing by rounding up and executing the Muslim Bosniaks.<br/><br/>The war story is told with a fictional love story. A 24-yr-old Zana Marjanovic is Ajla, a Muslim and an artist, and she is excited about meeting a new guy, Goran Kostic, Danijel, a Serb. They go to a night spot with singing and dancing, when a bomb explodes, perhaps signaling the beginning of the war.<br/><br/>The movie which runs nearly 2 hours has the story of Ajla and Danijel woven into the war. Danijel is an officer in the Army, he discovers Ajla in one of the camps where the women cook, mend clothes, and provide sexual services. He has her brought to his camp where he protects her and carries on a strange romance tainted by the fact that he is the enemy of her people, seeking to eliminate them.<br/><br/>The movie is a good reminder of the ugliness of war."
"onyxasha","3","2","10","14 March 2013"," Poor Translation Ruins the Show
","The acting may be fine but the fact that the translation is truly some of the most shoddy work that many will ever encounter, really kills it.<br/><br/>This is at least the case where the English translation is concerned. In fact, there was no use putting up with it for more than about 20 min. though there were hopes that it would improve in the long min. as audience - quite a generous donation of time considering...<br/><br/>We're given about 1 out of every 3 to 5 lines translated and what is worse is that these supposed translations don't consistently match the scenes. It seems as though someone used an online translator to do the work and got paid. Totally unprofessional 'work' that somehow made it past the editors, producers, etc. Tsk tsk! <br/><br/>How embarrassing for those who invested their talents and energy in the making of it... Definitely both thumbs down."
"kosmasp","6","2","10","22 October 2012"," Bold, but not without flaws
","This movie is obviously meant as a statement and to raise awareness on some subjects, that especially Americans were not aware of. Europeans might be annoyed (as is evident in some of the comments here), you have to be aware of that. Angelina Jolie is a great actress and she might have watched some great directors work, but that doesn't mean she'd put out a masterpiece with this movie.<br/><br/>The central story does concentrate on the religion more than anything, which leaves out a large part of another conflict (Croatians vs. Serbians) and takes it easy with just Muslims being targets. While the it does only revolve around that (and does a caricature of the main bad guy), the central message is that of trying to understand another no matter our background. Of course the movie does raise some questions. Some subtle and some not so subtle (the ending for example!). Is it enough for you?"
"BlossomM","7","3","19","28 April 2012"," My thoughts.
","This film gives a good insight into what had happened and is still happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it shows realism that other movies fail to show, I'm glad to see Angelina cast some or all of the actors/actresses who have survived throughout that war. I don't understand why this has such a low rating, some people are blind to see what is decent to their usual corny Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>Some parts in this movie are slow at times though ... It might just be my impatience.<br/><br/>I've given a 7/10 rating which is good since i don't give anything higher than a 9, i'm still waiting for something to really surprise me.<br/><br/>..Not every story has a happy ending."

Ruined it really. <br/><br/>The war itself was extremely brutal and the ethnic cleansing horrific. This movie was able to establish that point in only a few scenes, so I give it a high rating. The dialogue to explain the war was well done, woven into the storyline well enough that it didn't seem like a speech. The actors were authentic and amazing, thank you for not hiring Hollywood actors for this project. <br/><br/>Overall, a great love-in-the-time-of-war story."

Since I know her personally I have to say she is such a nice and positive person. When she was without a boyfriend I tried to ask her for a date. She refused me flat out. Of course, I am not from the movie/acting business, but I am her fellow Sarajevan. Still, even that I was not to her liking I still, when I watch her act either in Gogo club or in Kamerni Teatar, like her very much. She radiates with such a positive energy, and is such a nice person. She is a Bosnian mixture of Sandra Bullock and Angelina Jolie."

In that aspect, the movie was good, it made me curious and think about a topic I did not previously know about.<br/><br/>The acting was also well done. The cast seemed to genuinely feel the character's emotions and troubles, and it was very touching to see a group of people connect while sharing such a sad story.<br/><br/>However, the plot was confusing..and hard to keep track of.

"eric262003","7","1","6","6 February 2017"," Flawed But The Intentions Are Good
","In its duration, director/writer Angelina Jolie's ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is open with visuals of grimness, macabre, and will likely leave you in state of utter discomfort. The focus of the film is set in the war between the Serbs and the Croats that ran rampant between 1992-1995 as we are treated to brutal murders, heart-breaking rapes and cringe-worthy malice that will make your stomach green with pain as the violence is plenty and never turns back. Alja (Zana Marjanović) is a Muslim Bosnian artisan was forced into sex slavery at a Serbian troop headquarters as she's soon becomes saved by a dashing young Serbian soldier named Danijel (Goran Kostic) whom she befriended prior to the chaos. I can respect Jolie's decision to refrain from making the chaos a spectacle, but the love story implemented into the story adds flames to the fume while the malice is happening.<br/><br/>While lingering onto Danijel's arms for her protection, Ajla is in a bind between whether Danijel is her soulmate or just his property. Danijel has opposed to fight with the Serbs as they were incapacitating the the Bosnian Muslims, though he still has to maintain his loyalty under the rule of his general father. While Ajla is being condemned by the other soldiers, Danijel stands there idly looking on. The feeling of unease becomes vital to Ajla as she put in a subservient position while Danijel expresses emotional rage regarding the fears surrounding him even to the point of pinning her to the bed and tying her arms on the bed posts with a belt and is about to rape her which shows he can be quite as tyrannical as his fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>Jolie succeeds is making the violence hardcore while keeping the torn apart lovers romantic tale in tact. There is no apologies to the raping and carnage depicted here while the Serb troops are looked as the lesser of two evils. Civilians are gathered to sign petitions regarding their belongings to the troops. The men are shot, the babies are dropped off the balconies and the ladies are sent to sex slavery. These grim settings are seen through the eyes of Ajla's sister Lejla (Vanessa Glodjo) who abandoned the city with her baby daughter.<br/><br/>Sure her humanitarian contributions can never be denied, Jolie doesn't neglect that this love story is set in the middle of a war, while also showing her disdain for international organizations and the United Nations for neglecting the war as the Balkans fell to defeat. With a cast primarily of Bosnian extraction and the use of dialects, the movie scores high points in terms of authenticity. In spite of the chaos the cinematography is quite impressive making us think we have not seen the end of Jolie's directing career.<br/><br/>The main flaw about this film is the conflict between Ajla and Danijel which feels like a war within itself. Danijel wants to remain honourable towards his father and doesn't want to be a failure to him. But he's still has signs of him that can be fully sympathized. Ajla is just his sex toy and yet she invites herself to be that way. The movie shows no apologies when its marred with oppression. The tyranny of the human race is right in your face it can be overwhelming. And the rough relationship between Ajla and Danijel does little to help soften the nastiness that's around them.<br/><br/>The talented Jolie shows she has potential as a director and writer is all there and even though there's flaws aplenty, the intentions are good. The love story in the movie reflects equally to the horrors of the Bosnian War which at times will leave a bit at times uncomfortable. The war depicted here is unsettling and really enough to leave you sickened. The film is strong is storytelling, but very distracting"

Ajla and some of the girls are bused to a Serb camp to service the soldiers. She finds former suitor Danijel who is now commanding the Serb camp. He tries to protect her as they begin a dangerous secret relationship.<br/><br/>The subject matter is harrowing and Angelina Jolie deserves some credit for tackling it. However, one gets a sense that she has taken on too much as writer/producer/director. It lingers on the disturbing like a horror movie. It definitely doesn't fling and it's a grind to watch. This is a long bloated slough which is tough to sit through."

Soon Ajla finds herself a captive to Danijel but the two slowly fall in love as the war gets bloodier.<br/><br/>Anjelina Jolie wrote and directed this film, which has a clear message throughout. There's no doubt that Jolie had a political motivation behind the movie and she wanted her message to be heard. Many people have called IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY an awful movie but I'm not going to go that far. In fact, I give Jolie a lot of credit for attempting to make a movie like this and especially when you consider it was the first feature she directed.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that there are a great number of flaws to be found here and I think the biggest problem is in the screenplay. The plot of this movie is extremely light weight and I'd argue that it's way too simple and single minded for its own good. I say that because the love story here is just one-note and it's really not too hard to figure out how it's going to end. I think the film really would have benefited had Jolie punched up the film and made it a bit deeper than just these two opposites who find themselves attracted to one another.<br/><br/>The battle sequences were certainly better handled by Jolie and she certainly wants to show the sometime graphic violence for what it is. I can't help but think that the director was influenced by SCHINDLER'S LIST and she wanted the violence to really hit people in the gut. Another problem with the film is that at just 127 minutes the film seems a lot longer due to the slow pacing as well as some subplots that really never add up to much.<br/><br/>For the most part I thought the performances were the best thing in the picture with Marjanovic easily stealing the film as the woman who faces various forms of horror as she tries to survive her ordeal. I also liked Kostic in his role as I thought he managed to pull off the rather difficult character. With that said, IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY isn't a complete success but it's not the bomb some people have made it out to be."

"kovacevica-21677","4","0","5","9 May 2018"," Hardly Accurate
","""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is a film directed by Angelina Jolie taking place in Bosnia during the war. It's about a Bosnian-Serb soldier named Danijel who is fighting for the Serb army, re-encountering Ajla, a Bosnian who is now captive in a camp he looks over. The once loving couple are now at a cross, as their motives and beliefs have changed since their situations. 
As a Bosnian, This film is absolutely horrible. It lacks realism in the sense that a Bosnian-Muslim woman would never fall in love with a Serbian soldier who pillaged and destroyed her way of life. The same goes vice-versa for Danijel. A Serb soldier who is full of propaganda and Serbian nationalism would never love a Bosnian-Muslim girl. If anything, he'd just see her as an object. Maybe even less. Ajla is also taken as a prisoner and stuck under supervision of Danijel. This is also a very flawed idea as Bosnian-Muslim women in those camps were stuck in tight spaces and used for rape. They were never protected by anyone especially their captors, Serb soldiers. The film captures a small stint of realism in how it portrayed the brutality of the Serbs. Such as a soldier barging in the apartment and throwing the baby off a balcony just because he could is indeed something the Serbs did to young Bosnian-Muslim children. Another accurate portrayal is when the Serb soldier bends the girl over and rapes her in front of everyone to humiliate her and get a kick out of it. These small acts of brutality is the only thing this film has done regarding historical accuracy, Anything other than that, is just BS hollywood writing.
All around, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is not a accurate, nor is it an entertaining film. I understand if the point of this was to appeal to western audiences. However, I'd rather use actual true stories from people who lived the war and use accurate information from them rather than idiotic, inaccurate Hollywood nonsense. Just because a film has a decent budget doesn't mean it's good. If there was anyone who'd ever want to know actual historical and accurate knowledge about the war in Bosnia through film, I'd strongly recommend ""No Man's Land"" and ""Cirkus Columbia."" These films are written and directed by people who have lived through the conflict and accurately portray what really happened in the country."
