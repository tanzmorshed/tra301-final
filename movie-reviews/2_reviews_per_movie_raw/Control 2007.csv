","For every icon, there is an unknown predecessor who paves the way. Before there was Kurt Cobain, there was Ian Curtis, lead singer of the post-punk band, Joy Division. 27 years after his tragic death, Curtis' incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn's film, ""Control."" It's only fitting that Corbijn serve as director since it was his early photographs of Joy Division that reflected the band's dark, introspective songs. Corbijn went on to photograph and direct videos for such musical greats as U2, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, R.E.M. and Metallica.<br/><br/>With his first feature film, Corbijn avoids the pitfalls of many music video directors who inundate us with flashy and unnecessary edits and camera angles. Instead, he lets the stark black and white of the film tell the story of a lead singer tortured by epilepsy, guilt, depression and suicidal thoughts. The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester, England in the late 1970s, a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. Manchester has since rebounded and is once again thriving.<br/><br/>Curtis is played by relative newcomer, Sam Riley, who's quiet and unassuming approach portrays an artist inspired by his heroes, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert, Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band.<br/><br/>As Joy Division begins to flourish, Ian's relationship with his young wife, Deborah, continues to distance itself. Academy Award nominee, Samantha Morton plays the confused wife trying to understand her husband's depressed soul. The film is based on Deborah Curtis' autobiography, ""Touching From A Distance"", so it comes as a surprise that Morton's character does not have more scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The key to Control is understanding Curtis' depression, which the film accomplishes to near perfection. As he battles epilepsy, the young singer lives in constant fear that his next seizure will be his last. His only option is to swallow a daily cocktail of prescription drugs with side effects so terrible, that most of us would rather tempt fate than endure the aftermath of the pills.<br/><br/>Ian's spirit is also tortured by overwhelming guilt brought on by an extra-marital affair with a part-time journalist, played by Romanian-born Alexandra Maria Lara.<br/><br/>The most telling scene comes when Ian records an in-studio track for the song ""Isolation."" While Curtis stoically sings into the microphone, his band mates are distracted with the normal banter that typically occurs in a studio.<br/><br/>""Mother, I tried, please believe me. I'm doing the best that I can. I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through. I'm ashamed of the person I am."" The lyrics seem to fall on deaf ears except for those of the sound engineer who refers to it as ""genius."" But Ian's brilliance is also a desperate cry for help ignored by everyone in the studio.<br/><br/>The 27-year-old Riley does an excellent job of capturing Curtis' aloofness on stage. Singers such as Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. But when Curtis performed, he immersed himself into his own world where the music simply served as the soundtrack. Riley skillfully draws us into Ian's dark world with a range of subtle head movements and facial expressions to a whirling explosion of arm gyrations that came to personify the singer's stage performances.<br/><br/>Overwhelmed with grief, shame and depression, Ian finally succumbs to his demons at the young age of 23. He left behind a wife, a child and a musical legacy that is finally receiving its just rewards nearly three decades later.<br/><br/>For those looking for a story solely about Joy Division, Control may not be for you. But for those seeking an intuitive perspective into the anguished spirit of one of the most influential alternative bands in history, you will certainly find it in this depressing but incredibly beautiful film."

","Control, a biopic about a band from Manchester, is getting serious attention from around the world. Starting with an award in Cannes. That's maybe more than you might expect. Joy Division, a respected band of the 70s, are hardly a name on everyone's lips. And films made by ex music video directors about yet another load of rockers rarely raise eyebrows. So why is this different? Joy Division, for non-initiates, were a post-punk Manchester band of throbbing guitars and dark, doom-laden lyrics. Recognition in the music biz (especially by other musicians) was perhaps even greater after the death of lead singer, Ian Curtis. Control covers a period from his schooldays to his end in 1980 (aged 23). It is based on the biography of his widow.<br/><br/>Control uses Curtis' love of poetry, as well as the more familiar songs-that-tell-a-story device, to provide at least scant insight into the music. ""I wish I were a Warhol silkscreen, hanging on the wall,"" he muses. But what is dealt with in much more detail is his growing sense of isolation, coping with epilepsy as the pressures of touring build up, and the distraught domestic relations he is embroiled in with wife Debbie (Samantha Morton) and romantic-interest-from-afar Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara). ""It's like it's not happening to me but someone pretending to be me. Someone dressed in my skin,"" he says.<br/><br/>In a telling scene when he is under hypnosis, the camera revolves around his head as we hear voices speaking to him. ""Ian, let me in, love,"" says his wife, ""there's room to talk."" Responsibilities as husband and father. A mistress who is also in love with him. A band and fan following who want more than he can give. From warholian, carefree screen-dream of youth, he has arrived at a place where he doesn't want to be. Drugs and their side-effects no longer a schoolboy's recreational laugh. Prescription bottles grip with morbid fascination. And the knowledge that doctors don't have a cure.<br/><br/>The film carries viewers away with blistering intensity. Relative newcomer Sam Riley plays Curtis with alarming energy. With Samantha Morton, it's not what she says but what you see going through her mind. She contains her expressiveness for the camera to pick up (rather than thrusting it on us). We want to cry inside for her character. As a feat of interiorisation, Control puts her as a contender in the shoes of Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Supporting cast members come through with believability and sincerity, sparkling with well-honed contrasts. Toby Kebbell, fast-talking manager Rob, lifts us out of the depressive mood with wisecracks enough to make legless monkeys jump. ""Where's my £20?"" asks a hapless stand-in as Rob deals with an emergency. ""In my f*ck-off pocket!"" he barks back. Craig Parkinson is record producer and late TV presenter Tony Wilson (to whom the opening screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival was dedicated). He demonstrates fine shades of teeth-gritting tolerance, explaining to the band, seconds before their first live TV show: yes, 'large dog's c*ck' counts as swearing, and would mean the broadcast is pulled. Established Romanian actress, Alexandra Maria Lara, succeeds in making Annik far more than the two-dimensional bit-of-fluff that would have been an easy course. As potential home-breaker, it is tempting to hate her, yet her character is shown with the intellectual appreciation and chemistry that Debbie can no longer offer.<br/><br/>Morton, in the Q&A after the Edinburgh premiere, links the film to Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. It is the kitchen-sink, downtrodden existence that her Debbie inhabits. Cinematography is also reminiscent of this period, with its careful black-and-white observation of working class streets. I watched it a second time, enjoying careful compositions and suggestive mise-en-scene. But director Anton Corbijn is typically modest. ""I really wanted you to look at the actors on the screen and only afterwards at the look of the film."" While Ian, in Debbie's eyes, might be the licentious and 'angry young man' of social realism drama, the Control scenes from which she is tormentedly absent show another side: the world experienced by her husband (a reference in the film likens his isolation to Brando's character in Apocalypse Now).<br/><br/>""And we would go on as though nothing was wrong. And hide from these days we remained all alone.""<br/><br/>Riley takes on manic expressions as if marching away from an impending epileptic fit while singing Transmission. It is such a potent, almost frightening feat, that we have to shake ourselves to remember he only got the part when he was stuck for a job. ""Not a lot was going on in my life before this, so I was appreciative  for the work and the money,"" he tells the opening night audience. ""I imagine this will have opened doors for you,"" I had said to him earlier; he smiled like a man who still can't believe his good luck. But the 'luck' is very well deserved. His 'Ian' is physically and mentally complex. When I had managed to stop him on the Red Carpet long enough to congratulate him, Mr Riley explains that he had a friend who was an epileptic. ""I witnessed an attack often enough to be able to copy it.""<br/><br/>Although the film has a driving energy that takes our breath away, it drifts a little towards the tragic conclusion. We know the ending and it is a case of waiting for it to happen. And although it features plenty of excellent Joy Division tracks, any music biopic will never be good enough or accurate enough for some fans.<br/><br/>Fortunately this is not just for music fans but for serious film fans as well. It careers in a tightly controlled arc, where music biopic meets cinematic excellence. Why should you see it? ""Some people visit the past for sentimental reasons,"" says Corbijn. ""Some people visit the past to understand the present better."" Control is not in the sentimental exercise category."
"howard.schumann","10","128","158","30 September 2007"," An extremely moving experience
","Days away from embarking on a long dreamed about tour of the United States, Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the band Joy Division, hanged himself on May 23, 1980 from a rope in the kitchen of his apartment. His suicide not only ended his promising young life but also the dreams of a generation. Twenty seven years after his death, the eulogizing continues. Last year saw a documentary by Christian Davies: Joy Division: Under Review and this year has brought two more films: Joy Division: The Last True Story In Pop by Grant Gee and Control, the winner of the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Based on the 1996 memoir ""Touching From a Distance"" by Ian's widow Deborah Curtis, the film follows Curtis' life from his teenage years to his tragic death at age twenty three.<br/><br/>Unlike conventional bio-pics like Ray and Walk the Line with their star glamorizing propensities, Control delivers a three-dimensional portrait of a real human being and how his troubles affected the people closest to him. The film is directed by photographer and video director Anton Corbijn, a celebrated photographer who took some of the most recognized photos of Joy Division. Because he knew and worked with the band, the emotional connection to its subject is palpable. The film is shot in black and white and the choice underscores the grayness of Curtis' home town of Macclesfield, England and the grim mood of much of the work.<br/><br/>The major reason for the film's success, however, rests with lead actor Sam Riley who eerily recreates Curtis in appearance and voice. He performs all of the band's iconic songs such as Atmosphere, Love Will Tear Us Apart, and Twenty-Four Hours himself, using Curtis' robotic hand motions on stage to great effect. Another outstanding performance is that of Samantha Morton who plays Deborah Curtis, Ian's loving and patient wife who is overwhelmed by her husband's success and her new responsibilities as a mother of their daughter. Married at a very young age, both husband and wife lack the strength to make a go of it especially with the pressure of Curtis' epileptic seizures growing worse, and Ian's on again off again affair with Belgian journalist Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara).<br/><br/>Though the subject matter is melancholy, Matt Greenhalgh's script provides a light touch filled with trenchant one-liners from the group's manager Rob Gretton (Tony Kebbell) and witty remarks from band members Joe Anderson, James Anthony Pearson and Harry Treadaway. Although Curtis has become one of rock's most mythologized figures, Riley plays him simply as a very innocent, down to earth young man whose talent was much greater than his ability to handle it. Control is an extremely moving experience whether or not you have foreknowledge of the events of Curtis' life. It is a film that has the power to touch and leave memories that are indelible."
"tmk1","8","46","54","18 October 2007"," Style and Romance
","I saw this film last night then I went home and read a lot of the comments here. I think some things have been missed between the glowing reviews and the bitter disappointments.<br/><br/>First, it is a truly beautiful film and I found the acting uniformly excellent. That has already been said plenty of times.<br/><br/>More interesting to me are the comments about this not being an accurate or fair portrait of Ian Curtis and those around him. I've read plenty of accounts that characterize Ian and his band-mates as relentless practical jokers -- the book Torn Apart by Mick Middles and Lindsay Reade is full of these anecdotes. But I also think it's naive to expect a film like this to be anything close to a fair and objective telling of anyone's life. This is a dramatic interpretation, not a documentary.<br/><br/>In addition to the multiple meanings the title has for the characters in the film, this film is itself an exercise in CONTROL: Deborah Curtis's control over her husband's legacy; the surviving band members' control over the public image of Joy Division.<br/><br/>No, the film does not show the laughs and good times the band had, but this is in keeping with all of Joy Division's work. Their entire output as a living band was highly stylized. Almost everything they issued was in stark black and white; their imagery was overwhelmingly bleak and funereal; and they certainly courted controversy with their name and imagery. All of which was very consciously and tightly CONTROLLED by the band and the people at Factory. They gave few interviews and preferred to let the work speak for itself.<br/><br/>My point is that this film simply continues that project. It is yet another highly stylized piece of work in the Joy Division canon. To paraphrase the Tony Wilson remark that has been cited elsewhere in these comments -- when you have the choice between the legend and the facts, go with the legend. Their work has always had an epic, legendary quality. This movie is absolutely in keeping with that aesthetic.<br/><br/>I think it's also worth noting that Corbijn was a participant in shaping the Joy Division legacy from the very start -- his photographs of the band helped shape their image and his video for ""Atmosphere"" set the tone for how their legacy would be preserved. CONTROL is simply another collaboration with the band and their music. An extension of that original project.<br/><br/>I think that ultimately this film is an excellent piece of work. Just as Joy Division produced music of astonishing beauty and resonance out of the misery of life in post-industrial England, this film turns personal pain and loss into a powerful piece of art."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","63","81","15 March 2008"," Walk in silence, don't walk away in silence.
","For me personally writing a comment for Control has proved to be a very difficult thing, my love of the band Joy Division has stayed with me from the very first moment I listened to the Unknown Pleasures album back in 1979. I remember Ian Curtis's death like it was yesterday, and no matter how many years roll by, I still feel an immense sadness when listening to the bands poetic beauty. I was mightily relieved after reading Deborah Curtis's book Touching From A Distance, for I found it refreshingly honest, and certainly it helped people get in a bit deeper to just what a troubled young man Ian Curtis was. So here we are in 2008 and the film adaptation of that book has arrived with truly brilliant results.<br/><br/>I have found it hard to write a comment for it because I have to cast aside my biased love of the band, but hopefully I've managed to view it objectively with both my head and my heart. Control is a film about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the band Joy Division, people expecting an in-depth film about the band will be a little disappointed because this is the story of their lead singer, a troubled young man who just couldn't face it anymore. Filmed in black & white to perfectly capture the essence of the man the film is about, director Anton Corbijn has stayed loyal to the source material and crafted a haunting piece of work that lingers long after the final credits roll.<br/><br/>We follow Ian Curtis from his humble music leanings in the early 70s, here he meets Deborah who is soon to become his wife, a married man at the age of 18. We watch him join a group of Manchester lads at a Sex Pistols concert, it is here that the roots of Joy Division are formed. Then it's on to the formation of Factory records and the influential Svengali Tony Wilson. As the band start to make waves Ian Curtis becomes ill with epilepsy, and it's here that Corbijn crucially shows that the doctors involved really didn't have a clue how to treat him properly, trial and error with cocktails of drugs indeed.<br/><br/>Deborah and Ian become parents to Natalie, but Ian is away on the road for many days and nights, and it's here that he yearns for love from another quarter, and it's here that his infidelity will hang heavy on his already sunken shoulders. The band are set to make it big, their manager announces that they are about to tour America for the first time, this only adds another fraught string to Ian's already fractured bow, the pressure of fame a lethal bedfellow with Messrs epilepsy and infidelity, and then? I can't praise the work on this film enough, Sam Riley {relatively unknown outside of his hometown of Leeds} is simply brilliant as Curtis, dragging the viewer in completely on this desperately sad journey. Samantha Morton as Deborah is immense, she nails the emotional see-saw role with professional aplomb, and I would also like to raise a glass for the performance of the criminally undervalued Toby Kebbell (Dead Man's Shoes, Wilderness) his turn as Joy Division's manager Rob Gretton is down pat. Director Corbijn clearly had love for the project, and thankfully he was sensible enough to not over do the sentimental aspect of the troubled star. What Corbijn has done is perfectly frame the bleaker side of the story with old terraced houses and monstrous looking high rise's, they scream out as dank and dreary statements in black & white, yet they are overlooked by rolling hills to serve as a reminder when Curtis was at his happiest during the courtship with Deborah. Some scenes are unforgettable, such is the power of the emotion on offer, look out for the stunning appearance of heart tugging song Love Will Tear Us Apart, a crucial and poignant scene, and of course the film's tragic outcome hits like a sledgehammer. To which I thank Corbijn for giving us a very tasteful conclusion to this sad sad story.<br/><br/>So there it is, was I biased? I like to think I wasn't because I honestly feel that one doesn't have to be a fan of the band to get much from this movie. The film has won many awards, and I'm happy to report that Control has brought renewed interest in the beautiful/haunting work of one of England's greatest ever bands. Remastered CDs, reissued books, and even T-shirts are selling well in the shops as I type.<br/><br/>Control is a very sobering experience for fans and newcomers alike. 10/10<br/><br/>RIP Ian Curtis, you are very much missed."
"Chris Knipp","8","51","66","12 October 2007"," Rise and fall of a rock legend in evocative black and white
","The first thing that strikes you about 'Control' is its silence, and the chilly beauty of its black and white images. As a still photographer first-time director Anton Corbijn photographed Joy Division in black and white during their short existence. He knows how to get the remorselessly grim feel of the north of England in the late Seventies. (The boys came from the outskirts of Manchester. Joy Division formed in 1976.) This film (there's a documentary just coming out on the band too) is loosely based on a memoir of her marriage by Deborah Curtis, lead singer Ian Curtis' young wife, who had a baby girl by him and then tragically found him after he'd hanged himself in 1980, two months short of his twenty-fourth birthday, just as the band was to tour America for the first time.<br/><br/>'Control's' strength is a certain recessiveness. In the English style, it's offhand and avoids huge dramatic crescendos. That's refreshing. And besides the images and the restraint, the film is worth seeing for the concert sequences. The cast actually plays the Joy Division music live, and Sam Riley, who plays Ian Curtis, not only closely resembles him, but is a riveting and intense, almost at times scary, performer. When he says the public doesn't know how much of himself he puts into his performances, we know what he means.<br/><br/>The film is excellent at showing Ian's dilemmas. The band is a sudden success. He has an attack in their car as the band returns from a gig. Doctors tell him he has a form of epilepsy. He's given a fistful of pills to take every day and told to have early nights and stay off the booze. How faithfully he takes the pills is unclear but he suffers from their side effects in various ways, while late nights and booze are essentials of his existence. It doesn't seem that the English doctors knew very well how to treat him, and he was so busy performing he didn't take the time to go to specialists and have more extensive tests.<br/><br/>Ian had gotten married to Deborah (Samantha Morton) early--too early. On the road he meets a Belgian part-time journalist, Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), and they fall uneasily in love. He's not strong enough to decide between the two women. Fear that his disease will only get worse hounds him, and the fits go on. Riley is fascinating to watch as he undergoes an increasingly visible meltdown. Other cast members are cyphers, though Joe Anderson, who has the role of Max in Taymor's Across the Universe, is the lead guitarist. Morton has a drab role but Deborah's unfortunate situation is present as a constant counterpart to Ian's story. The two other important characters are the Manchester music guru Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson) and the band's wise-guy manager Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell).<br/><br/>The creative inspiration of the band, the nature of their songs, the cast of their lyrics, the reason why Joy Division is a cult band today when it only existed for four years--these are matters the film is unable to elucidate. Watch it for the cool visuals, for the tall, soulful Sam Riley, and for the terrific live performance scenes. Enjoy the understatement, and the silence. Don't expect more.<br/><br/>Harvey Weinstein has chosen both for Control and for the soon-to-open Todd Haynes Bob Dylan film I'm Not There to have a slowly-unrolling distribution system, and hopes to bestow early cult status on both films by having them premiere at that temple of cinephilia, Film Forum, in lower Manhattan, New York City, and wait for the buzz of the cognoscenti to multiply and spread. It may work. But both films are tough sells. But A.E. Scott of the NYTimes has said Control is ""enigmatic and moving, much in the manner of Joy Division's best songs."" And that's a good send-off."
"come2whereimfrom","8","85","115","1 July 2007"," A stunning and moving portrait.
","Making the leap from photographer to music video director to film director, Anton Corbijn's feature length debut 'Control' is quite simply stunning. Shot entirely in black and white it tell the story of Ian Curtis the lead singer with Manchester band Joy Division but its also much more than that it also tells of one mans journey into the heart of darkness (Apocalypse Now is mentioned in the film) a journey of fear, paranoia, illness and depression. Curtis has been played in films before but only as bit parts (24 hour party people etc) here he is portrayed breathtakingly by Sam Riley who played Mark E Smith in 24 hour party people and when he first appears on the screen I have to admit I wasn't convinced but as Ian the person grows so too does Riley into the role and at times he has him so down to a tee its hard to imagine its not the real Curtis up there. The rest of the band are pretty good as well but are only really second fiddle to Riley but you have to give them credit for learning all the songs and playing them live rather than mime. Samantha Morton is great as the put upon wife Deborah and Craig Parkinson is convincing enough as Tony Wilson but apart from Riley's stand out performance its Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton who has some of the best lines and has come so far since his role in 'Dead Man's Shoes'. The cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes, being shot in black and white adds to the mood and gives a haunting feel that echo's the music and lyrics of the band, it also means (and I guess its Corbijn's photography background) that so many of the shots in the movie could be still images they are framed so well. Although never really explained in terms of answers, Curtis's illness from the seizures to the depression and the hopeless sense of falling apart reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Polanski's 'Repulsion' another black and white film that deals with madness. I guess that treating mental illnesses was still in its infancy in the seventies, yes we'd stopped electro-shocking people but medications were still being developed and trialled. It seems it was very easy for Curtis to reach a certain point what with juggling home, life on the road, his condition and the pressure of increasing fame but when it came to helping him out he really was on his own and did feel a sense of 'isolation'. But with a story that has a widely known end point its more about the journey and here Corbjin punctures the narrative with some truly witty moments while leading up the incredibly moving and inevitable finale. Handled brilliantly by all involved this is another example of a great British film that deserves all the accolades it is receiving and if this performance is anything to go by expect Riley to be very big indeed."
"garvneil","10","55","76","9 October 2007"," stunning piece of work.......
","Anton Corbin has created a film that perfectly showcases both the music of Joy Division and the short but fruitful life of Ian Curtis. The choice to film in black and white was the right one. It sets the tone perfectly for Ian Curtis' gray and lifeless hometown of Macclesfield in 1973.<br/><br/>Corbin as a first time director excels utilizing his visual and technical skills from his previous life as a music video director. Thankfully Control is not just a beautiful looking movie but a perfectly pitched study of the rise and tragic fall of the tortured Ian Curtis. The intensity of the live music performances in the film are as visceral as those of the real band. It is a credit to the actors that they played everything live on screen, it serves to create memorable performances.<br/><br/>Sam Riley delivers a towering performance as Curtis. The first time actor is a name to watch. He is surrounded by a great cast but the film is carried on Riley's shoulders.His inner turmoil is conveyed with great humanity and realism. The audience was still and quiet for quite some time after the credits rolled at the screening I attended.<br/><br/>There are some very clever and touching uses of the music in the film. Corbin uses the intensity of Curtis' lyrics to help paint a biographical picture of the man. The use of 'Love will tear us apart' in the movie was particularly inspired giving the context of the scene it was played in. I hope you will go see this powerful and moving film to see what I am talking about."
"i-burgess1","9","50","75","5 October 2007"," Surprised that it was so good
","I read the reviews of this film and decided it was worth a punt. I have to say that although I was in Manchester during the 1970s I was not a fan of Punk music. This film is beautifully made - almost like a 1950/60s kitchen sink film of the gritty north (there are worse places than Macclesfield, believe me!). I don't know Joy Divsion's work but the acting in this film by the major players was excellent. Sam Riley as Curtis is very very good as is Samantha Morton as his downtrodden wife. I thought the guy who played the manager was a bit OTT. What a shame that Tony Wilson died before this was released. My reaction to it was much like the one I had to Trainspotting. I was convinced that I wouldn't like it but came away feeling that this was a very important film. Even if you don't know Punk music or Joy Division - go along. Well worth it."
"Adrian_Atkins","6","119","224","19 October 2007"," A strangely ordinary man
","About a third of the way through watching Control, it occurred to me: if this film were about somebody who wasn't famous, it would be absolutely dull. As depicted in this film, Ian Curtis was a very uninteresting person. Besides being the lead singer of Joy Division (and I will take nothing away from the music) he did nothing extraordinary with his life. Nor was he an extraordinary person. He displayed no feats of courage, no wit, he didn't stand for anything, was indecisive, lacking in charm, passionless, an atrocious father, rarely smiled, and possessed no ambition. I can see why he killed himself. <br/><br/>So the question remains: why are we watching this film?<br/><br/>I have the feeling that there was a lot more to Ian Curtis than nice cheekbones, intense stage presence and epilepsy. And if not, then a point should be made of that. Is this the story of the shy kid who wanted to be David Bowie but then couldn't handle the fame? Was it just the pills that sent him spiraling? Is it a comment on just how normal he actually was? This film has no angle. The acting is excellent. The black and white photography is lovely. The sound design is superb. But all these components are masking the fact that this is simply an astonishingly banal script. There were scenes and dialogue that left me scratching my head, thinking why did we have that? It feels like a first draft. There is no drama in most scenes - for example, the exchanges Ian and Anook are incredibly lifeless.<br/><br/>In spite of all this, the film is utterly convincing. It's just also utterly uninspired. I think I will read a Curtis biography now and find out what really made him tick."
"DaMarco-2","3","36","62","14 January 2009"," A greatly missed opportunity, undeservedly praised
","I was fortunate enough to live in Seattle and witness firsthand the grunge movement, so the explosion of a musical scene--as what happened with post-punk in Manchester, U.K. in the 70s--fascinates me, and I've been catching up with all that post-punk music that I missed out on back in the day. I loved Joy Division's dark sound and wondered why they didn't have a larger oeuvre of work. A little research revealed the reason to be lead singer Ian Curtis' suicide on the eve of the band's American tour in 1980. This intrigued me with Curtis and the band, and I thought Joy Division had the makings of a good movie. And it does, but this is not that movie. Having seen it I am amazed at the plethora of great reviews this film has gotten. It is perhaps the most mundane film ever made about rock and roll music! If a person had no knowledge of rock music and was first introduced to it through this film, he would think that it was a product not of rage and angst, but tedium and solitude.<br/><br/>""Control"" is unnecessarily filmed in black and white in the hopes of fooling dilettantes into believing it is high art, and given the rave reviews from American critics, it succeeds in its foolery. Director Anton Corbijn has used b&w in previous films with rock subjects only to make the film look artistic because he has no cinematic idiom of his own. Corbijn never makes use of the shadows and light that are the very point for a modern filmmaker to us b&w. Moreover, this film needs to be in color to capture the grit and decline of Manchester in the period. Speaking of which, the film never seems to step foot in any place but a bland suburb. To understand these characters and their motivations we need to see the decline of the industrial titan that was Manchester, but we see only modest homes and verdant lawns. Just what dreadful life were they responding to with their music? The characters in this film live rather decently in what appears to be a bucolic setting. Even when the band makes a trip to London we only see shots of them in their car going to and fro. This is perhaps the most anti-urban film ever made about an urban subject.<br/><br/>Even worse, there is no sense of a musical community, and that is a grave crime given the burst of energy that emanated from Manchester in that period. If this film is to be believed, Joy Division seemed to exist in a vacuum, with inspiration coming only from David Bowie and Sex Pistols records, with no acknowledgment to their peers and contemporaries.<br/><br/>The entire genesis of creativity is given the short shrift as well. We see Curtis write poetry which presumably will become songs. He goes to his room and closes his door to shut himself off from the world, but we never see the world that influenced his need for solitude. Curtis is not portrayed as a tortured soul--which undoubtedly he must have been--but as an easygoing bloke who doesn't even seem to disdain his civil service job. Sam Riley does well enough in his role as Curtis, but never breaks through. You keep waiting for him to show us the magic but he only manages to during the concert scenes. But then, how could any actor achieve that task? All Curtis does in this film is mope.<br/><br/>Samantha Morton, so good in other work, is still good here but she isn't given much to do. The dissolution of her marriage happens fairly easily and without much complaint from her character. Toby Kebbell stands out as the band's manager Rob Gretton. Sadly he breathes the only excitement and energy into this whole enterprise. I would comment on the other band members but I couldn't tell one from the other. Whatever friendship existed between them was not brought to the screen, and the other three band members are as much a backdrop as the sets. This movie would suggest that they were of no consequence, when in fact they went on to form New Order and rise to the prominence for which Joy Division seemed destined.<br/><br/>Even the film's title is a cryptic cop out. Joy Division's breakthrough hit was ""She's Out of Control,"" but unlike ""Love Will Tear Us Apart,"" it didn't reach a seminal status. Is ""Control"" a reference to Curtis' seizures? His personal life running astray? If so, how is his experience unique enough to give this movie such a definitive one-word title? How is he in any less control of his life than Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, or Michael Hutchence were of their own? The title is generic, and one can only guess that the movie was not called ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" (which would have been incredibly apt) because of contractual issues.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise about this film is that in spite of all its tepidness, it has received great reviews from the likes of Roger Ebert and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. ""Control"" had an 87% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes! Anton Corbijn has fashioned a movie about rock music that is devoid of any of the energy, zest or verve of the musical form. This film isn't the least bit enlightening about Ian Curtis, Joy Division nor Manchester's post-punk music scene. It is blandly made, employs stock moments from biographical films and only engages the viewer on a few occasions. Corbijn has a history of making movies about great rock subjects (U2, Depeche Mode) and draining every bit of life out the bands and their music. Now he has done the same for Joy Division. Skip right by ""Control"" and go directly to the documentaries, ""Joy Division"" or the BBC produced ""Factory: From Joy Division to Happy Mondays."""
"kentuckyfriedpanda42","10","16","25","22 August 2007"," Beautiful and haunting.
","Making an auspicious feature film debut, Anton Corbjin brings the same wonderful sense of essence and truly understanding to his subject matter in ""Control"". What I've loved over the years with Corbjin's work as a photographer is how he manages to capture the essence and spirit of his subject matter whatever it may be. He does this to a remarkable degree in ""Control"".<br/><br/>""Control"" is a biopic/portrait of Ian Curtis, lead singer of the Manchester band Joy Division. Just as the band was beginning to build a name for itself, Curtis took his own life in 1980. He was only 23 years old.<br/><br/>With any biopic where the central character is deceased, there lies the inherent problem of maintaining audience interest when the conclusion of the story is known. Corbjin does this beautifully via a number of things he does in ""Control"". The very striking cinemascope black and white photography has a very warm and tactile feel to it. It sounds like a cliché, but one feels that time and place that the film depicts.<br/><br/>The extraordinary cinematography is combined with a strong, sympathetic script and wonderful performances from a largely unknown cast. Sam Riely is an absolute revelation as Ian Curtis. Having only seen this actor in a small role in Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People"", which covered some of the same ground that ""Control"" does, Riely really holds the screen as Curtis. While not physically identical, he absolutely manages to capture Curtis' feeling of displacement and depression. Definitely a young actor to watch.<br/><br/>The only 'name' actor in the film is Smantha Morton, who plays Ian's wife Debbie. An exceptional actress who doesn't disappoint here. The actors who play the other members of Joy Division are quite effective and bring a welcome sense of humour and gravity to what is, at times, an intense and depressing story.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. My pick of 2007 so far."

"thedevilis6","2","49","95","9 October 2007"," Atrocity Exhibition - Too Easy to Watch
","Well...to be brutally honest, it was terrible. The film was really very weak and didn't entice in any way. The thing looked quite nice, all black and white monochrome photography, but even that was only good in spurts. <br/><br/>Full of rock biopic cliché's, it was simply too easy to watch, a factor that jarred considerably with the dynamic that made Joy Division (and Ian Curtis) appeal to such a vast amount of people. This dynamic, typified by eerie and haunting atmospheres(excuse me) which seem horribly alienating at first but ultimately draw you in with the accurate depiction of the depths and despair of the human mind, is something that sets the band apart from the crowd. They created their own unique sound that transcended boundaries and created a new strand of punk music. This film was an opportunity to apply that ethic to another medium, to truly realise the essence of the man and the band.<br/><br/>The line (paraphrasing): ""It feels like its somebody else, just wearing my skin"" is indicative of the films outward appeal and its mainstream tendencies. In fact, the film is far more malignant and sinister than Curtis' own dissolution.<br/><br/>A travesty. The good bits(or the bits that weren't really bad), which were mainly the parts where the band were playing gigs, only served to make you feel horribly let down at how good the film could have been and how much of an injustice the source material had been paid. <br/><br/>The casting seemed good on paper, having an unknown playing the main part and giving Samantha Morton a supporting role as the suffering wife. But it just didn't work. Morton was a cliché of the down-trodden and doting wife, all watery eyed and desperately attempting to put their problems out of her mind, and Sam Riley was far too much like a certain more modern 'punk icon', Pete Doherty. It was bizarre, I couldn't get him out of my mind, the big drawn eyes, the wiry gangly frame, the cocky charm, the theatrically wistful stare, it was ridiculous... And from what's been written, nothing like Ian Curtis; he wasn't attractive, he wasn't likable; he was an ugly, cold, self-involved person, and knew it. <br/><br/>I won't mention the rest of the cast, as I feel I may just sound like an angry Joy Division fan. Suffice to say, the earlier comment about rock biopic clichés applies.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed, thought it was going be good and it just wasn't. Simple as that. And I hate it when films try to condone suicide, its such a pathetic thing to do, the guy had plenty of people who cared about him, but still he screwed them all over. Some would argue that it doesn't condone it, it simply shows it, but this I would disagree with. <br/><br/>Saying that, go see it, the songs are played well for the most part(the band who play Joy Division are actually a Leeds band in real life, and actually play the songs), and there are one or two really nice shots of Maccelsfield(!), particularly towards the start. One in particular of the couple sat under a tree just before he proposes sticks out. You may like it, I don't know, it seems plenty of people do for some reason!<br/><br/>I appreciate that many will disagree with my opinions, which is fine, but just know that I care very much about cinema, and am very worried and disturbed when films such as this receive such acclaim."

"scovazze","8","11","18","15 June 2007"," Half of a virtuoso piece
","Two years spent salivating on this project. Anton Corbijn directs a biopic about Ian Curtis! Can life get any better? ooh well. It came out as a weird documentary with maximum emphasis on two aspects at opposite end of the spectrum and, unfortunately, some shallowness in the middle.<br/><br/>It's directed by whom I consider the best living photographer; I've been a lifelong fan. And he won't disappoint me about his visual talent: every single scene in CONTROL is visually perfect, pure Corbijn, perfectly balanced black and whites, nearly mathematical composition (a scene of Curtis asleep at his work table made me gasp for its total formal beauty, algebra in black and white).<br/><br/>Beautiful, are they? Imagine two hours of this- - - - - The mind never really gets into the flow of the story (at least, MY mind never did): it was like watching that Corbjin exhibition in Groningen in 2000, where I walked slack-jawed in the museum halls. As much as I love Corbjin's work, I find that his virtuossism here may be distracting if you're a fan.<br/><br/>So, the cinematography is outstanding. The other outstanding thing is the acting by this kid I've never heard, Sam Riley, (born in 1980 bless him), who plays Curtis. At the beginning one is suspectful: the kid is way too cute, one fears that his good looks will be distracting. But you slowly come to respect and admire his performance: he has Curtis nailed down. (We must remember that the movie is based on Curtis' wife's memories, and she may have quite a chip on her shoulder, but the other members of the band AND Tony Wilson are VERY much alive and kicking, so I trust that all the facts are punctual and realistic).<br/><br/>This is, simply, the story of a weak kid who got himself in a situation that was too big for himself, and he didn't know the way out. ""When everything was simpler"", as he says around the end of the movie, he had hastily married and had a child; he was in a small band and playing gave him pleasure. Then things became too much: he developed epilepsy, the drugs for it were a constant torture and made him drowsy, he fell asleep at work, lost his job; he quickly got tired of his wife and showed no kind of emotional relationship with his little daughter (whom he only looks at with disconcert; she is another cause of his losing control over his own life); a gorgeous Belgian lover quickly became more of a pain than a relief, as he obviously gets discovered by his wife, and he finds himself in the middle of a tug of war between the two women. Worst of all, ""he is becoming quite famous now"", but he has lost the enjoyment that music gave him, he thinks the public doesn't understand him, one night he actually refuses to go on stage (and when he finally does, the strain of it gives him an epileptic attack). In his view, there is nothing left living for. End of it.<br/><br/>Sam Riley is surprisingly good at conveying Curtis' slow descent into hopelessness. The director sure makes him cry an awful lot, but one fears that Curtis was exactly like this in real life. He was simply a kid, too weak for the kind of life that he could have had and that looms over him like a threat more than a promise - global success, money, a loving wife, a daughter and God knows how many lovers, Belgian or not. Riley's performance is restrained, he never goes over the top, not even towards the end. I suspect that the son of the Calvinist pastor surely would never have allowed him; all the performances are dignified and restrained, even Samantha Morton as the very patient wife (perhaps too normal a wife for him? One gets the feeling they didn't really connect; ""she loves to live in Macclesfield"", Curtis whines) is not too emotive: this is a very everyday tragedy.<br/><br/>So, the lead actor is good and the cinematography is good. What's left in the middle - the MOVIE itself - is a bit disappointing, more a documentary than a movie. Nobody explains us what was in the young musician's mind, HOW the band, who up to that moment had grown listening to glam rock - as the soundtrack lavishly proves - came out with such a different, restrained sound; the band gets more and more famous but we have no perception of that if not by some awkward dialogue (""boys, we're getting bigger! We're going to America!""), so the audience can't really feel what influence fame had on Curtis. Luckily there are no big musical moments, just snippets: after all this is not a movie about Joy Division, it's a movie about the strange, depressing and depressed boy who fronted it.<br/><br/>Is it worth seeing? Oh yes, everyone will go. Non-Corbijn fans will have a better time than I did, because they will see the movie, not the cinematography. Would I buy the DVD and keep it forever? No. 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE is more effective in describing Curtis' short life with some emotion - and that was a *comedy*."

","Well, it's all been said in other reviews right here.<br/><br/>The first words that pop into my mind when thinking of this film are: ""Oh my God"", and that's because this is an awe-inspiring piece of work, made in the European black and white super-realism tradition of the 1960's, and so masterfully done that you feel like you are watching a documentary made just the other day.<br/><br/>It's painful; it's sad; it's powerful; it's riveting.<br/><br/>Sam Riley delivers a masterful performance as the doomed, sensitive, depressed Curtis (and you really do feel that), Alexandra Maria Lara is superbly gentle yet distant (hard to believe this is the same actress from Downfall) and Samantha Morton is brilliant as ever.<br/><br/>Yes, the direction does teeter a little on the edge of being self-important, but this is a hell of a movie that draws you in to being emotionally involved almost despite yourself, and the ending you already know is heading down the line remains shocking and very very sad."
"framesasecond","6","16","29","1 November 2007"," Pretty surfaces, shallow depths
","I'm reminded of why biopics generally fail when they attempt to present some objective truth about their subjects based on the subjective impressions of people that knew them: the inner lives of others, even that one person we are closer to than anyone else, remain mysteries to us. Control's Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is composed of the recollections of his widow, Deborah Curtis, who shares co-writing credit and served as the film's executive producer. Like Hari in Solyaris who is incomplete because she's only a manifestation of Kris Kelvin's impressions of her, there appears to be nothing more to Ian than what Deborah believes to be the truth about him.<br/><br/>While Ian remains incomplete, Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), the third party in this love triangle, is reduced to a cipher. We know nothing about her, and she appears to know nothing about Ian. Months into their relationship she implores him to open up by telling her his favorite film and color. That this conversation is the most intimate that they have beyond a clichéd marrying-young-is-a-mistake confession within hours of meeting, demonstrates how completely the deck is stacked against empathy for Annik and by consequence against understanding Ian's interest in Annik. The conclusion Control would have us draw is that Ian's tryst with Annik was the product of little more than base sexual desire muddled with repulsion at the banality of life with Housefrau Debbie Samantha Morton) and baby. This does a disservice to Ian, Annik and, ultimately, Deborah."
"iacblue","6","7","11","13 October 2007"," Beautiful Corbijn photography, but mediocre story line
","I just saw this film the other night at the Mill Valley Film Festival and have mixed feelings about it.<br/><br/>First, its strongest point  the cinematography. The black-and-white photography on this film is top-notch, as one would expect from a film directed by an acclaimed photographer like Anton Corbijn. Although Corbijn is working with a d.p., Marin Ruhe, the look of the movie is clearly his, and the shots of people in relation to architecture, the angles, and the creative shots of light poles and other city features are all classic Corbijn. The biggest departure from Corbijn's signature look is that film doesn't go with the ""overcooked"" grainy look of his photographs.<br/><br/>But as for the quality of the storyline, what can I say  its a biopic. Which is a genre with a lot of limitations and one that is rarely spectacular. ""Control"" is no exception in this regard, telling a fairly linear tale of a tortured and self-destructive artist. Nothing much new here. Some of the use of musical cues are really ham-fisted, such as the scene where Curtis breaks it to his wife that he's no longer in love with her, which immediately segues into a montage built around ""Love Will Tear Us Apart Again"". (But considering that Corbijn is the same person who directed the visually evocative, yet schmaltzy video for ""Atmosphere"" back in the 80s, this isn't surprising.) <br/><br/>The film also makes for an interesting comparison with Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People"", a very different movie that nonetheless is about many of the same characters and events. Given that Winterbottom's movie came out only 5 years earlier than ""Control"", many of the events in ""Control"" are quite familiar to the audience from the earlier movie, and its interesting to see how ""Control"" handles this. In several cases, such as the scene that shows the initial meeting of Tony Williams and Ian Curtis, the scenes play out more or less the same, but are shown from Curtis' point of view rather than Williams. In fact, the scene in which Williams signs a contract with Joy Division in his own blood is even included in ""Control"", even though this is apparently an apocryphal story that was made up for ""24 Hour Party People""."
"gushjones","7","12","22","25 November 2007"," Overrated, falls short of expectations
","If it weren't for the music, or if this movie wasn't about Joy Division, it would probably get a 6 out of 10. It's true, it's got some great black and white shots, quite nice use of music, both Joy's and Bowie's -though ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" was too obvious- and Sam Riley's and Toby Kebbell's performances are also good. But that doesn't make a great film. <br/><br/>Go watch ""24 Hour Party People"". This should get you in the whole Manchester mood. It seemed to me (a Greek music lover far from the Manchester scene both locally and chronologically) a much much more enjoyable and honest film.<br/><br/>Conclusion? Not a bad movie, i recommend it so you may have your own opinion, actually made me shiver in one or two occasions... But that's because it was about Joy Division. The bad news: soulless, skin-deep, in fact a non-existent script (haven't read Deborah Curtis' book to compare), everyone's characters but Ian's are poorly portrayed... Copycating older footage doesn't make you a director.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 solely for the music and the live performances"
"artisdeadpeppermint","8","2","2","9 March 2013"," Beautiful movie, depends who's watching
","Control, the story of Ian Curtis, singer of British alternative band Joy Division. The film is made in black and white, which adds a certain edge to the film. There isn't much drama or fast-paced scenes (until the very end, I guess), and that seems to be what everyone criticizes about the movie. Why do you think the director wanted it black and white? If it had been a sincerely boring film, why release it? <br/><br/>Of course they made up some aspects of Ian's life, but the fact is that Ian was a dull, depressed human being. He couldn't handle love, or fame overall. He doesn't show signs of emotion in the film, and doesn't speak much at all. Truth is, black and white was exactly what he saw, while he was spiraling towards the end of his life. <br/><br/>The acting is incredible. Absolutely spot on. Very very noteworthy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Control, but that's only because I love indie films and rock and roll movies. If you're looking into this movie expecting some delicious drama and edge-of-your-seat thrills, just don't watch it. It's about a man who gradually fell apart, who gradually lost control. And if you can't see that in the film, it's definitely not worth watching."
"Dr_Kruger","8","2","2","11 September 2008"," Visually bleak, yet moving and honest Biopic
","Use of Black and White is sometimes used unnecessarily, and can sometimes come across as a little pretentious. In Control I'd say it was essential. Every shade of black to grey to white is used perfectly to bring life to the film, but always reminding us of the bleak character we are dealing with. The ending I found to be particularly moving, the thick black smoke from the church lifting our antihero into the skies around the fields of Macclesfield.<br/><br/>The film also manages to convey very accurately all the events from his short life from a teenager up until his death without passing judgement or making rash statements about his character. It presents the facts and allows us to make up our own minds as to why he behaved as he did. Sam Riley was terrific, especially in any scene involving Joy Division's performances. He really nailed it. The use of music as the soundtrack with no additional scoring seemed to add to the bleakness of the quiet dialogue sequences.<br/><br/>I was also quite fond of the portrayal of Rob Gretton by Tony Kebbell, who weirdly played alongside Paddy Considine in Dead Mans Shoes who in turn played Gretton in the Factory Records themed film ""24 hour party people"". He added a little touch of humour which, without it would've made the film unbearably depressing."

","I remember how overwhelmed I felt when the scene on the first TV appearance starts with 'Transmission'. It felt so surreal. I loved that movie because somehow it forces you to do your part and pay attention to what is not said or obvious. Yes Ian Curtis's life is dull and uninteresting if you approach it with a cold eye. But what can anyone expect with a life well...so short? Like many incredible talents he was about to blossom, this was just the beginning of something much more bigger and intense. It was raw energy.<br/><br/>I completely had empathy for this young man marrying at 19 getting stuck in a marriage-mortgage-9 to 5 job hell when obviously he was meant for something different. Paying the consequences for a decision taken too young, and being propelled to fame so quickly unable to cope with the pressure and energy that it takes when it was obvious he'd never make it very far. I hope the people who will watch the film will remember this and the context of the 70's. I think Corbijn did a fine job at portraying the desperate situation Ian Curtis was in, doubled with illness and depression. Sam Riley is incredibly convincing at portraying these feelings, the guilt, the doubts, the inevitable spiral where Ian Curtis was doomed to fall. <br/><br/>The choice of shooting the film in B&W was of course intentional and as Corbijn said, I too cannot think of the film being shot in colour. It perfectly renders the darkness and sober atmosphere of JD's world. The film is full of strong contrasts which completely defines what JD's music feels to me: Energetic Depressive"
"AudioFileZ","8","2","2","1 June 2008"," Haunting...
","This will be a short, hopefully concise review. I did not know Joy Division's work even though I was in my early twenties when they started to ascend. I always have loved music yet find stuff like The Cure and Depeche Mode not to my liking since it is darkly obtuse-that may explain my being unaware of Joy Division. That said, this movie seems brilliant in the way one becomes immediately drawn under the spell of both Curtis and Joy Division's music. Ian, though seemingly unaware of the audience, keeps the audience rapt. The music, though depressing, is very well played, the lyrics direct and as a result connects. We all had some of the same feelings, and not just as young adults. Unfortunately we have seen the effects too many times. Therefore it is relevant I'd say on some level with us all. As stated the movie brilliantly portrays what happens when mental illness and guilt derails the person. Nothing, short of addiction, is more insidious than mental illness and this is a sad document that should be seen as it pulls no punches and is truly haunting."
"adrian_stranik","8","2","2","9 April 2008"," ""Hell shaped room""
","In 1979 a young Dutch Photographer called Anton Corbijn heard an album called 'Unknown Pleasures'. Within days he had left Holland and headed for England intent on locating the makers of the record. He found them in Macclesfield and, with a series of monochromatic images, began to forge their legend.<br/><br/>A scant eighteen months later the group were considered one of the most important bands of the post punk era. On the eve of the release of their second album, their biggest hit single and an American Tour, their lead singer hung himself in his kitchen. The first rock and roll suicide - he was twenty three.<br/><br/>Corbijn went on to have an amazing career in which his photography and video promos resulted in much of modern rock's iconography via his work with U2, Depeche Mode, The Rolling Stones and many others, and now, finally, he has come a full circle with his directorial film debut telling the story of the band which brought him to England in the first place.<br/><br/>The band was Joy Division. The film is Control.<br/><br/>Control is the biopic of Joy Division's lead singer; the charismatic but deeply troubled Ian Curtis. Joy Division had emerged from the fallout of the late 70's punk explosion. Taking the inert nihilism of that new sound and instilling it with an intellectualism far removed from the cheap shock tactics which sold it to teenagers everywhere, Joy Division, with the visionary brilliance of producer Martin Hannett, developed an oeuvre of dystopian soundscapes which continues to serve as a ground zero for new music to this day.<br/><br/>Based on the book 'Touching From a Distance' by Curtis' widow Deborah and starring newcomer Sam Riley in the lead role, Control does as much to dismantle the Curtis cult as it does to propagate it. The sleek futurism and Ballardian preoccupations of the music are in stark contrast to the kitchen sink dour-ocity from which it emerged. Control is a rock and roll 'L Shaped Room' or 'Look Back In Anger' with an epileptic Jimmy Porter dumping his trumpet for a Vox Phantom guitar. Terrifying evocations of Curtis' jerking, trance-fixated on-stage persona, juxtaposed with his day job at the local job centre or making cups of tea in the mannered surroundings of his small council house is as far removed from our perception of Curtis the uber-prophet of urban ennui as can be imagined. Think Bowie trying to set the video recorder or Lou Reed doing the washing up.<br/><br/>The musical sequences deftly convey the chaos and excitement of the band's live appearances thanks to Riley's convincing portrayal of Curtis but Tony Kebbell as Rob Gretton, whose introduction and pronunciation of himself as the band's new manager, is the highlight of a film which may be too drama-heavy for fans and, perhaps, too long for everyone else. Nevertheless, Control is a crash-course in the banality behind the bombast and the dissection of a myth. Tony Wilson, owner of Joy Division's record label Factory is often quoted as saying ""if it comes to printing the truth or the legend, always print the legend"". With Control, Anton Corbijn has managed a collision of both."
"Joejoesan","8","2","2","28 March 2008"," So this is how it really was?
","As a Joy Division fan it is difficult to have an objective look at this movie. Just after Ian Curtis's suicide (in 1980) the real story of Joy Division became a true mystery. Why did Ian Curtis kill himself? How many songs were unreleased? What other bootleg would turn up? And is that really Peter Hook or Bernard Sumner singing In a lonely place? Or was it in fact Ian Curtis's very last studio recording? Questions, questions. Because they were not answered, Ian Curtis became a mystical legend, who - like Jim Morisson - flirted with death long before he killed himself.<br/><br/>I don't know which events in the Anton Corbijn movie actually happened. Based on the book by his widow maybe 70% of it all is correct, because even a view from a witness is of course a subjective one. For fans like me it's great to learn about the events that may have happened. In the eighties I always thought that Ian Curtis committed suicide because he was frequently depressed due to his illness. I never knew that he was struggling with his marriage and that there was another woman in his life. I didn't know he worked as a social worker either. Legend had it that he spent his days in a factory; a job so dull that it gave him enough time to daydream, thinking about nice words to put in his lyrics. The beautiful black and white images by Anton Corbijn give the movie Control a poetic documentary feel. The fact that all the actors really played their instruments themselves also helps this.<br/><br/>As a fan you really get a chill during the concert scenes. You could never have been there when Joy Division played Leaders of Men, No Love Lost or even Transmission or Digital on stage. I became a fan when their last studio album Closer was released. Ian Curtis was already dead at that time. Watching the movie is the next best thing. The actors playing Joy Division are great. Sam Riley is a great 'on stage' Ian Curtis. He is also convincing in the drama scenes, fiction or not. <br/><br/>But is Control enjoyable when you don't know anything about Joy Division? I really don't know. Is there enough suspense and drama in this movie? Hard to tell. I read a review by Ian Curtis's daughter (also featured in the movie) who surely sees Control as a recount of what actually happened. She said that the city of Manchester was lacking in the story. I agree. I hated 24 Hour People, but at least the Manchester scene had a major part in that movie. Also lacking was a good view of Ian's many depressions. Yes! I have never met him myself of course, but watching Control I was surprised by how lively and communicative Ian Curtis was. To me in the movie he was not the depressed man that would later hang himself. I can imagine that the real Ian Curtis would have been more down and introvert. Otherwise he wouldn't have taken his own life, would he?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this movie. Right afterwards I put on my Joy Division vinyl albums and got lost in legendary tracks like New Dawn Fades, Love will tear us apart and Dead Souls. Joy Division and New Order really defined my teenage years in the eighties. As a fan I think Control is a very well made movie, directed by a person who might have been just as important for the alternative eigthies music-scene as well. Anton Corbijn made beautiful pictures of all the great bands from that time (U2, Echo & the Bunnymen, XTC, Elvis Costello), so if there was one man who could do this, it would be Anton. Control is a grand statue for one of the biggest new wave (or rock) heroes in history. Ian Curtis will never die.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Control - as other people have said - did look great. (Although the black and white, while arty, made it seem like world war two. Wouldn't late 70s colour capture the era better, like in their wedding photos?)<br/><br/>But, more importantly, it was just so telemovie.<br/><br/>First, like lots of mediocre bio pics, it was 'this big event happened, then this big event happened ...', in chronological order, so it was clunky and melodramatic.<br/><br/>Secondly, we had no emotional connection with Curtis' distress. Clearly Curtis couldn't talk about his pain in any enlightening way - yet the movie relied on him *explaining* why he felt this way! So it was basically being popular meant there was pressure. Or something like that. No sense of anything more profound. We did see he wanted to sleep with two women at once. And he took medication. But that was it.<br/><br/>Disappointing!"

","It's surprising what a name can hide, what a word defines and what it leaves out. ""Control"" brings some light to late vocalist Ian Curtis, the man itself, behind Joy Division.What is often spoken is that he had a tragic death at the age of 24 with a suicide that ended a rather complicated life. Not being a true fan of J. Division and not knowing what it was about i was surprised by the young boy hiding behind that name, trying to find out his way through live the best he could. His youth mirrors every aspect of his life, from the impetuous choices he made to the early marriage and fatherhood or the passionate/silent relation with Annik. That's the center key for the whole movie, watching a young man trying to shape itself, trying to grow, coping with life, becoming aware of choices and trying, just trying, to be in control. All of this with a troubled personality. The black&white cinematography works perfectly to portray the dismayed dormitory cities in England's 1970's, pure urban voids where nothing interesting seemed to possibly grow; and surprisingly the background for cult bands of that time. It seems he never left those places."

Worst of all it draws to a close as some kind of weird suicide porn, meticulously detailing his humdrum last hours for no apparent purpose other than to allow a little more build up to the suicide that all cinema-goers knew was coming before they bought the ticket. In the end I felt that rather than great cinema it was an ad-man's technically skillful but artistically bankrupt treatment of a biography."
"Redcitykev","8","5","8","15 January 2008"," Caught the atmosphere wonderfully
","Speaking as someone 'who was there' - ie a teenage/young man in the late 1970's/early 1980's - the first thing that struck me about this film was the way in which it captured the atmosphere of that age. Dank, grim and often feeling bereft of hope for the future. Into this dark world stormed music which attempted to capture the zeitgeist of the age, groups like the Sex Pistol, The Damned, The Clash etc, and, above all of these to my mind, Joy Division and their strange, troubled looking lead singer Ian Curtis.<br/><br/>In trying to capture the essence of Ian and the band onto film is no easy feat, and director Alan Corbijn has almost pulled it off completely. The dissolution of the times, the soul destroying high rise blocks, grubby clubs (many a night spent in such places!) and a society on the verge of Thatcherism is wonderfully portrayed, and use of music, going from the glam of Bowie to the 'in your face' Pistols creates the atmosphere of society on the turn.<br/><br/>It is clever in the way that Corbijn only shows the reaction to other groups - ie like when Ian and Deborah are watching Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, or the lads - ie Hooky et al - are transfixed by the Pistols. This is repeated when Tony Wilson watches Joy Division for the first time, his reaction is splendid! This allows for the performances by Joy Division themselves to take centre stage, and when they do, WOW! Corbijn captures the live experience in a way that is almost Scoreses/Raging Bull in its intensity.<br/><br/>Needless to say the cast are all fine, with Ms Morton again giving an object lesson in portraying tortured females on the screen - ie 'Longford' and herself as Maria Hindly. But of course, as with anything connected to Joy Division, it is Curtis we have come to watch, and Sam Riley delivers a once-in-a-lifetime performance as Ian. If he does anything better then I REALLY want to watch it! Yes the film is bleak, it was a bleak era, and the humour could be lost on those who were not there - it is typically British Northern, and, speaking as a Southerner, I did find it a little hard to take - but the film does give an insight into a tortured soul without ever being sentimental or cruel.<br/><br/>If the film has a fault it is that it is, maybe, a little too long - 10 minutes could have easily been trimmed, and it is at times a little too bleak, but it is rewarding if you were there, the memories will come flooding back, believe me!, and if you were not, then it shows you what you missed out on!"
"Craig_McPherson","8","5","8","23 October 2007"," Beautifully tragic
","In the 80s I was as rabid a Joy Division fan as there ever was. I owned their complete discography going back to their Warsaw days, including rare bootlegs and limited pressings given away in British music magazines. I was also utterly floored upon hearing the news that lead singer Ian Curtis had committed suicide, hanging himself on the eve of the band's scheduled departure on what would surely have been a ground breaking US tour. So it goes without saying that had director Anton Corbijn's biopic Control been released back then, I would have flocked to it as only a fan can do and likely loathed it for peeling away the veneer of myth surrounding the singer.<br/><br/>Jump ahead 27 years and time has proved to be a great leveler. The fan-boy enchantment I once held for the group has been replaced by a continued respect for their music, and a more realistic view of the man who capitulated to his inner fears and demons, and left behind a loving wife and young daughter at the precise moment when a world of opportunity was about to open.<br/><br/>Corbijn's Control manages to capture that disconnect between the mythic Ian Curtis of fandom, and the real man who repeatedly strayed from the medication prescribed to control his epilepsy, turned his back on a devoted wife, and ultimately robbed his band-mates of what should have been their shining moment.<br/><br/>Based on ""Touching from a Distance"", Deborah Curtis' 1995 account of their marriage, Control's centerpiece is the performance of Sam Riley, who brings to the role such an uncanny resemblance to Curtis that he almost appears to have been cloned. Curtis' on-stage mannerisms, tics and quirks, all of which can still be viewed thanks to YouTube, are all there. So is the music, but only as a backdrop to the actual story. Corbijn, who was initially reluctant to helm this project for fear his reputation as a rock video director would unfairly label the movie, casts the story in the fitting downbeat mood it demands. Filmed in gritty black and white, the film captures the bleakness of northern England and, in its own strange way, forces viewers to narrow their focus on the story being played out rather than being enchanted by the music scene of the day.<br/><br/>It follows Curtis' life from pre-band years spent working in an employment office and aiding seniors at a nursing home, through his teenage marriage to Deborah and the birth of their daughter a few years later, to Joy Division's sometimes turbulent halcyon days with Manchester's Factory Records - it's all there if you've followed the band's story, and therein lies the movie's only problem. I'm not sure how well Control would play out to anyone who wasn't a fan. It's not that the movie requires the viewer to possess background knowledge to fill in the gaps, because it doesn't, but its impact and magnitude of the tragedy wrought by his death likely won't be the same. In fact, Control is yet another testimony to the breadth of stupidity and selfishness of Curtis' suicide as Deborah's loving book upon which it's based, as well as her assuming the mantle of the film's co-producer, continue to serve as an indicator of her love for the man who was conflicted in his emotions for her and ultimately took the poetic coward's way out of his family's life.<br/><br/>Much in the way Curtis' band-mates managed to find closure by morphing into New Order, Control provides Deborah Curtis and Ian's legion of fans a way to look back in silence and walk away, even if it leaves you shaking your head at a life, love, and opportunities lost."

","Black and White images of the life of Ian Curtis. David Bowie's songs in slow motions. Smoking cigarettes in depressive bars. Here are the young men, the weighs on their shoulders. ""Control"" is an esthetically portrait of the lead singer of Joy Division, from the day he meets Deborra, his future wife, to the day he dies. It's from her eyes that the story of his life is told, and this subjective and personal point of view gives coherence and strength to this touching movie.<br/><br/>Useless to say that the photography of the movie is beautiful, and carries a real artistic point of view on this biopic. The construction of each frames of the film reinforces the solitude and loneliness of the character, by isolating him in one part of the screen. Only when he's with Annik Honoré, he's paradoxically allowed to be completed. The music is also beautifully played and interpreted, and the actor Sam Rilley's made an impressive visual as vocal work as Ian Curtis. His version of ""She's lost control"" is for instance almost better than the original one.<br/><br/>The only reproach I can make to this very well done movie is maybe a little over-interpretative uses of Joy Division's music. Every songs has to means something in Ian Curtis's life. ""She's lost control"" is a direct reference to his epilepsy or ""Love will tear us apart"" is a statement about is the failure of his couple. This constant references to Curtis life trough his song gives a rather unoriginal and predictive use of them, that culminates in the last song of the movie, ""Atmosphere"", that is exactly use as in Witterbottom's movie ""24 Hours Party People"".<br/><br/>But besides this ""Walk the line"" aspect of the movie, that can be considered as the week point of every biopic about a singer, the movie is very touching, honest and beautiful. All in all, it's an excellent cinematographic translation of Joy Division's musical universe. One last transmission ? Listen to the silence, let it ring on Eyes dark, relentless, frightened of the sun, we would have a fine time living in the night Left a blind instruction, take away our sight !"
"eric262003","9","3","4","15 July 2013"," Shows That Not All Rockers Who Die Young Are Druggies
","Ian Curtis breaks away from the clichés of young rockers who died before their time. Instead of sex, drugs, alcohol and being totally messed up. Instead this individual has succumbed to a lifelong struggle with epilepsy, a disjointed marriage and the struggles that go with being a rock performer. ""Control"" sets the record straight that go beyond the typical rocker biopic, but still we never truly see who the real Ian Curtis was and somehow we may really never know.<br/><br/>Sam Riley stars as Ian Curtis, the frontman of the 1970's punk band Joy Division. I'm not giving away anything by saying that he committed suicide and made himself into an icon in the music world. The central stories behind Curtis in his battles with a troubled marriage, his battles with epilepsy, and his lust for a Dutch girl named Annik. Riley must have done his homework with his role as he is a standout in every way possible from his voice to his eccentric quirks. He does sing his songs and I take my hat off for that. Curtis was no Paul McCartney, but his voice did stand out above the rest and Riley succeeds in that area.<br/><br/>From the movie we get a good overview as to just how melancholy Joy Division's music was really like. Other bands were not always that spontaneous but the nuances behind Curtis' cynical lyrics behind his singing makes the setting of dreary Manchester, England all the more apropos. Sure there might be a few exaggerations coming on here and there at times, but does not over do it like ""Walk the Line."" Instead it gives the viewer the chance to piece together the metaphoric puzzle. When he's at the unemployment office and young lady is having a seizure, this was the inspiration to their hit song ""She's Lost Control."" It's all in the matter of dissecting through the subliminal messages in the lyrics to get a better understanding of the modus operandi of Joy Division and what they write about. Sure the camera crew make it obvious as they show you around Curtis' troubled mind as they show us a series of sentimental books written by the likes of JG Ballard and William S. Burroughs or how enthusiastically wants to see ""Apocalypse Now"". So these tiny details demonstrate just what kind of character Curtis was like.<br/><br/>The thing that irks me about musical biopics is that they hardly look into the creativity of a musician, singer or a group. In ""Control"" we are treated to the drum tracking behind ""She's Lost Control"". And we can understand the strange hissing sound coming from a spray can. I wished that there would have been more screen time for the character who played Martin Hannett, Joy Division's demanding producer (we all thought Phil Spector was demanding). But in all respect, Hannett gets credit for creating the unusual sound that made Joy Division a league of their own. Sadly he was on for five minutes. Where did the group decide to use the bass guitar as the leading instrument and have the lead guitar demoted to background instrument (much like The Who where John Entwhistle's bass was more the leading instrument than the guitar). It could have been because Peter Hook was more available in studio than Bernard Sumner? Who knows?<br/><br/>Overall, ""Control"" is one of the more underrated musical biopics. Riley turns in one of his best performances as the troubled rocker and what influenced him in his shortened life. But Ian Curtis is still one of life's mysteries and we may never know much about him unless we actually sit down and talk to the surviving members of Joy Division, Bernard Summer, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris. You can listen to his music till your blue in the face, and still never able to unravel what's gone through the creator's head."
"secondtake","8","3","4","15 February 2010"," Sam Riley astonishes, and moody late 70s Manchester is convincing...
","Control (2007)<br/><br/>The first thing that should strike someone familiar with Joy Division's music, and with movies about rock bands, is how low-key and unglamorous this film is. Instead of plowing into a bunch of music clips, or dwelling on drug use and brushes with early fame, Control focuses on the lead singer, the charismatic and troubled Ian Curtis. This is a movie about a bunch of ordinary seeming kids, each with their small quirks and sometimes rather small (but sufficient) talents, and about how they get through that first series of layers toward becoming a successful band. Shot in gorgeous, crisp black and white, and centered in a middle class Northwest England (greater Manchester) in the late 1970s, it is both serene and gloomy.<br/><br/>Sam Riley is undeniably the core of the movie as Curtis (the more famous Samantha Morton plays his wife well, but has a smaller role). We vaguely know what will happen by the end, so it doesn't just parade facts as the band wins fans and gets bigger gigs. It peers into the mind and actions of a gifted songwriter and idiosyncratic punk and post-punk performer. Riley manages to recreate the aura of Curtis, especially in these scenes early on where they are playing in obscure places with small crowds, and this is really hard to do, since pop music stars become legends in part because they have some special presence in the world, some quality that makes them stand out. But Riley manages even better to show the brooding, lyricist side of the singer. It's a must-see performance, subtle and convincing and singular.<br/><br/>Is this a way to learn something about Joy Division's music? Not really. And that's just as well. Go to iTunes for that (their first two albums are the core of it). The movie isn't about music, but about relevance, and how to take some ability and quiet drive and break out of the doldrums of life. It dips into the era with such believable and restrained simplicity it's a revelation. Yes, it sometimes flags, and sometimes seems to have only the one long, complicated thread, with a given outcome, and so it isn't an inventive, swirling work of fiction (the facts have it trapped) nor a masterpiece of ensemble acting (which it isn't trying to be). But it's about as good as movies about music and musicians get, and it's a beautiful, remarkable journey about one man caught up in it all, and in his own struggle for decency and significance."

","...not only in the U.S. of A. (where Joy Division was at best a cult band), but apparently in England as well, where the central character's band, Joy Division, was far more well-known. Such a shame, since ""Control"" is a well made, if somewhat slow-paced and (no surprise here) depressing film. Evocatively shot in black and white by Martin ""The Countess"" Ruhe, and directed by Depeche Mode (and others) video artiste, Anton Corbijn (also a former NME photographer and longtime Joy Division fan), ""Control"" limns the short, bleak life of Ian Curtis, the band's ill-fated lead singer.<br/><br/>Beautifully acted by leads, Sam ""On the Road"" Riley and Samantha ""Sweet and Lowdown"" Morton, along with a fine supporting ensemble, ""Control"" paints a stark portrait of a young man unable to weather the intertwining conflicts of love, notoriety, and adult responsibility. It wasn't love that tore him apart, so much as it was (as the film's title seems to indicate) an inability to deal with his own poorly developed self-control. Being epileptic assuredly didn't help, no doubt exacerbating Curtis' depressions and sense of helplessness, but ultimately the final arbiter of his suicide was no one and nothing but his own fragile, conflicted will. He had a fine wife, a child, an expanding place in the sun, a vehicle for his creative impulse, and yet he couldn't help but throw it all away, first by betraying his family and ultimately by betraying himself. ""Control"" has plenty of moral questions to pose, and to the filmmakers' credit offers neither facile nor concrete answers. The sparse, linear screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh (who's written another script now in production concerning John Lennon's early life) is based on a Curtis bio written by his widow (which I've not read), and feels fairly objective and non-judgmental, at least to this viewer. I suspect that the director's personal relationship with the Curtises had much to do with that.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: absolutely worth a watch for Joy Division devotees, Morton and/or Riley fans, and lovers of small, effective character-driven cinema. Highly NOT recommended for puerile mainstream audiences who regard Transformers movies or gimmicky films like ""Cloverfield"" as high art."

"Buddy-51","8","3","4","3 August 2008"," subtle, well-acted docudrama
","""Control"" is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour. The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.<br/><br/>One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here. And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works. Yet, ""Control"" is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale. The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.<br/><br/>In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn't receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah's memoirs chronicling their time together). Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group's songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film. The movie also makes effective use of voice-over narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.<br/><br/>For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind. Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.<br/><br/>Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine. What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared. What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old. With subtlety and insight, ""Control"" movingly distills the essence of that sadness."

","Sam Riley gives a great haunting performance, singing songs by Joy Division a lot like Ian Curtis himself. The story of Ian Curtis is told in an absorbing and realistic way, making you understand what this great singer and poet went through to commit suicide at 23.<br/><br/>Ian Curtis' wife, Deborah Curtis (played by Samantha Morton), is one of the producers of the film, which is based on her book. Taking that in mind, it is strange that her portrait is very sad, unfavorable and a lot less attractive than what the real Deborah Crtis looked back in the 80s judging by pictures. Conversely Ian Curtis' lover, Annik Honoré, is portrayed by German actress Alexandra Maria Lara in a beautiful and dreamy way, making this character much more attractive that she actually was, again judging by pictures.<br/><br/>Another one of the producers of the film was Tony Wilson. Unfortunately, he passed away a few months before the release of the film.

"Robert_Woodward","8","3","4","20 April 2008"," For fans and newcomers alike, a riveting portrayal of a young life falling apart
","Anton Corbijn's film Control charts the life of Ian Curtis, the lead singer with Joy Division, who committed suicide aged just 23. Curtis is introduced as a confident, Bowie-aping, Wordsworth-quoting teenager. Very soon he is a young married father and has joined a local band, first known as Warsaw and then as Joy Division. The pressures exerted on Curtis by performing with the band, his deteriorating health and an extra-marital affair lead to the unravelling of his life and mental state. The music, the drugs and the marriage that had once brought contentment become sources of anxiety and despair, culminating in his tragic death.<br/><br/>Sam Riley is remarkable in the role of Ian Curtis. His acting successfully spans from cocky teenager to tortured young parent, and his performance of Joy Division songs in clubs and studios are uncannily like the real thing; his singing voice and his dancing are spot on. The performance of 'Transmission' on live television is an electrifying experience and one of the high points of the film.<br/><br/>Sarah Morton is excellent in the role of Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, whose memoirs formed the basis for this film. Ian's betrayal of his faithful wife and young daughter is often painful to watch. The other band members of Joy Division, who went on to perform the band New Order after Curtis's death, are convincingly portrayed, from chirpy guitarist Bernard Sumner to surly bassist Peter Hook. Curtis's band-mates try to be supportive of him as his condition worsens, as do the music industry types surrounding him, including Rob Gretton, the band's sharp-witted agent, and Tony Wilson, the ultra-enthusiastic head of Factory Records. But the real tragedy here is that no one really understood what has happening to Ian or how to help him.<br/><br/>Photographer-director Anton Corbijn renders the film's settings in striking black and white. Much of the film is set in Macclesfield and the monochrome imagery plays upon Curtis's growing boredom and disillusionment with his hometown. Corbijn succeeds in creating a music biopic that is accessible to newcomers; I came to this film with little prior knowledge of the music and story of Joy Division and came away with much, much more. The film is adept at drawing connections between Curtis's life outside the band and how this fed into his lyrics and performances, notably when his relationship with his wife begins to sour and he responds by penning the words to 'She's Lost Control.' This is a superb film for fans and newcomers alike and certainly the best British film of last year."

","If Ian Curtis were a fictional character, he would truly be one of the most tragic anti-heroes of all time. He is a man whose romantic youth had been very foolish and had led to his sense of being completely trapped with every avenue of escape turning sour. The fact that he was a real person makes this story devastating. This is not a film for a rainy afternoon, but it is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>The strength of this film cannot be pinned down to one single area. Matt Greenhalgh's script is intelligent. Corbijn's direction is interesting. The soundtrack is electric. The look of the film is stylish. The cast is superb. It is an all round impressive piece of work emphasised by the fact that it is able to overcome its failings, which mainly stem from the pace. Whilst it is nice to see a film that is prepared to take its time, there are times when the speed begins to drag. However, it is worth working through the slower moments.<br/><br/>There are moments when the film is absolutely gripping and electric, but at all times it is interesting. Corbijn brings style effortlessly to this film. The monochrome cinematography may seem clichéd but it is completely apt and wonderful to look at. His cutting is fascinating: there is always something going on. His choice of music is brilliant and the soundtrack is an absolutely terrific collection of songs. It is an astonishing effort from the debut director, who actually photographed the band when they were in their prime.<br/><br/>He is supported by a pitch perfect cast. Sam Riley, in essentially a debut performance, is magnificent. He completely holds your attention and is sympathetic despite his character's human failings. He is assisted by a wonderful supporting performance from Samantha Morton. When the pair of them are on the screen together, they create genuinely touching scenes. From playing the happy young lovers right through the lows of their relationship, they are utterly believable. The rest of the ensemble, especially Alexandra Maria Lara and Toby Kebbell, complete the sense of the world of late seventies and early eighties Macclesfield.<br/><br/>However, despite the brilliant direction, the superb sound and the wonderful performances, the reason why this film will last for many years is the central story about a young man trapped by the accident of birth, his mistakes and his misfortune. It isn't uplifting and it isn't heroic. It is utterly heartbreaking. It is utterly human."
"cliffhanley_","6","3","4","8 October 2007"," Signalling a Kitchen-Sink revival?
","Anton Corbijn polished his craft as a stills photographer, and this film's greatest strength lies in its visual quality. Nearly all of it works as a series of animated stills. It certainly could not have done so well in colour: the director's experience shooting in mono for the music press (the 'inkies'), including of course the real-life Joy Division, and his professed admiration for early Ken Loach films, especially 'Kes', comes through clearly.<br/><br/>Michael Winterbottom has already covered a little part of the Ian Curtis story in '24 Hour Party People', including his suicide when 23. Matt Greenhalgh has said he was sorry to have missed the opportunity to write the script for it. As he is a Manchester guy he was the director's and producer Orian William's popular choice to write the screenplay for this one. The curious link here is that Craig Parkinson, who plays impresario Tony Wilson, the central figure in 'Party People', looks more like his impersonator Steve Coogan than the man himself, who, although he died before this film was finished, co-produced it with Curtis' widow Deborah. Toby Kebbell, truly unrecognisable from 'Dead Man's Shoes', puts so much meat into his portrayal of the band's manager, incidentally, that it's possible to re-imagine the whole saga being told from his point-of view, as some kind of very black comedy.<br/><br/>Much is made of the extraordinary contrast between musicians' day-jobs and rock 'n' roll stage personas: Curtis worked, neatly brushed and keen, in an employment exchange until the sun went down and he made his dreams of Gothic, sci-fi and beat poet imagery come alive on stage. Sam Riley has been touted as a 'non-actor' (another nod to Loach) but he handles the Jekyll and Hyde task very well. The gig scenes are convincingly handled, (something Antonioni, for instance, made such a mush of in 'Blow-Up') although a brief appearance by John Cooper Clarke the 'punk poet', playing his much younger self, just about blows everything else off the stage. Curtis got married young, to a local girl (Samantha Morton in yet another sublime disguise) but fell for Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara), a skinny and dangerous Other Woman from Belgium. It was being torn between these two beauties that inspired his most famous song, and combined with epilepsy and chronic stage fright that contributed to his suicide.<br/><br/>Before he became epileptic himself, he witnessed a job-seeker he was interviewing, suddenly having a major seizure. It's shown mostly from his point-of-view. It's an important event to include - he wrote 'She's Lost Control' about it - although misunderstanding about epilepsy is so widespread that it's feasible to expect some of the audience to go home thinking he 'caught' it.<br/><br/>The overbearing feeling of this film is of a Kitchen-Sink revival, albeit widescreen, and that's not just because of the monochrome. Just to top that, the final scene, as Ian Curtis leaves by way of the crematorium, of oil black smoke rising up to fill the sky, may be a reference to the milieu where the original concentration camp joy division had to work as sex slaves; although it has strong similarities with Charles Foster Kane's big finale."

","You'll see, Im a huge fan of New Order. And by consideration I learned some things about Joy Division, the group that led to New Order. Joy Division was led by Ian Curtis, a young singer with an integral soul, a poet, who sang stories of alienation, loneliness and devastation. He was a poet in the wrong bounds. His life was truly interesting. Just read the delicious songs of him and learn what lied behind him.<br/><br/>But what have we got here? I believe that if you presented me this movie bluntly, without saying the word ""Joy Division"", I would have not seen Ian Curtis in the film, just another biopic of a forgotten musician. The essence of the derailing, the soul that cannot keep with it's underling pressures and it's final blend: fame, drugs, and sensibility is not presented in an emotional, understandable way. Yes, sensibility. Ian Curtis was a sensible man; and the movie does a light, poetical justice to him. ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is a fine example of his insightful and paradoxical sovereignty over his feelings, that later would collapse.<br/><br/>First of all, black and white panoply unnecessary, as if the distraction for colors was utterly needed. It gives the film a pseudo-intellectual look , something that was disposable. Later, some theatrical, elaborated scenes took away from the film the simplicity I expected. Then Samantha Morton, Ian's wife. I don't see a character, a persona: I see a 35 year old actress dressed as a youngster. Maybe that's my own problem, but I can't get over her empty looks. The essence of Ian Curtis is somewhat inconsistent, making me feel uneven. Sam Riley does a nice interpretation, just nice. His demeanor and expressions wave me some despair, but not as in solitude, as in awkwardness. Some scenes jump to fast to their conclusion, without their valued insight: they marry too fast, they get into the band too fast. He lived to fast yes, but I guess that's no excuse.<br/><br/>I felt the movie entirely as if they did just a basic research over Curtis. Maybe I feel a blinding passion for his work and life that prohibits me to see further onto the movie's terms. You will like it, I believe. But Im explaining this as a review over Ian Curtis' life, over Joy Division, that I felt I ought over my consideration for him.<br/><br/>Anton Corbijin may be a good photographer, and he uses his working tricks to disguise this into an artsy film. Why is it that every biopic that comes out has to be deep, intelligent and the main has to get great credits? Im standing against ""Control"" to say this: -Could have been way better."
"MOscarbradley","7","4","6","12 January 2008"," The short, sad life of Ian Curtis ... but the music's great
","Joy Division passed me by. I was never much into bands being a singer/songwriter kind of guy, (give me Joni and Mr Dylan any day). Then I heard 'Love will tear us apart' on an ad of all things and I was hooked. Of course, I knew who Ian Curtis was and that he had committed suicide and that like so many rock stars who had died young had gone on to become something of a legend to his followers. I knew less, (zilch, in fact), about Aton Corbijn, the photographer who had chronicled a number of bands, (most famously, U2), in his photographs and whose links with Joy Division were formed long before this movie.<br/><br/>This is Corbijn's debut feature and he has made a fine job of it. The film is unremittingly bleak as it follows Curtis and the band through the initial throes of success to the depression that would finally claim his life and like the photographs with which Corbijn made his name it is in black and white. (It has the grimy feel of the kitchen-sink movies of the sixties). The gloom is lifted by the expressive music of the band, here brilliantly recreated by the cast and in particular by the extraordinary performance of newcomer Sam Riley as Curits inhabiting the role as if to the manner born, apparently, both on stage and off. I doubt if fans will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Likewise the chameleon-like Samantha Morton perfectly encapsulates the role of Curtis' wife from star-struck teenager through an unstable marriage to motherhood and it is on the book which Deborah Curtis wrote that the film is based. It is a dark film in every sense but Corbijn and Riley imbue its hero with a real compassion which makes the tragedy of his short and talented life all the more moving."
"NancyFiredrake","7","4","6","2 November 2007"," Visually and musically satisfying
","I expected a lot from ""Control"" after reading one or two glowing reviews and mostly I was not disappointed. It was every bit as gorgeous visually as the reviews led me to believe, and the music was enthralling, as I imagine it would have been watching Joy Division in person. However, I didn't find the emotional story as convincing.<br/><br/>The actors were all terrific, from leads Sam Riley as Ian Curtis and Samantha Morton as his wife Deborah down to the extras at shows, but special mention should go to Tony Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton, and Eady Williams as the Curtis' baby Natalie.<br/><br/>Despite the overall gloom of the story, this movie has moments of great humor and beauty. However, I was not emotionally convinced by the on screen relationship between Ian and Annik. As portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara, Annik is pretty, but otherwise not very substantive. This is understandable when you remember that the movie is based on the book written by Ian's wife.<br/><br/>I was also not very moved by the depiction of Ian Curtis's epilepsy and the difficulties he had with his medications. I never really felt what it was like to BE Ian; mostly I saw a mopey bastard who was a neglectful father and cheating husband. In turn, I was not much moved by Ian's eventual demise, because the build-up wasn't convincing.<br/><br/>I found Sam Riley's performance mesmerizing, but there were too many moody shots of him walking around in his trench coat."
"tishoftheno","Null","9","19","7 October 2007"," P***ed me off
","I just saw it. I was equally saddened and angered by it. It is an unfair portrayal of Ian Curtis and an unrealistic one of everybody around him. Style/photography was good and music was brilliant, of course. But as biographies go, this is a stinker. The dead demand our respect and fairness because they cannot speak for themselves.<br/><br/>I can elaborate. In brief. Black and white for realism is, well, fair enough, but some realism would also help. Throughout the film the one guy who comes across as a morose arse (to the ignorant) is Ian Curtis. Everybody else is loving/caring/friendly/pat on the back jolly life-loving people and what is wrong with Ian unable to cope with all this love and attention? Nobody will ever know what happened between the late Ian Curtis and his widow. But a film supposedly on a dead music legend, which is based mostly -if not solely- on his, well, it's fair to say ""scorned"" widow's book is doing neither of them any justice.<br/><br/>I saw some romance (they were, let's face it, kids) and living in boring Macclesfield but I hardly saw anything about the way the band came together and how they interacted and developed musically. Which is, basically, what I expected, a bit. And not to mention aspects of peoples' relationships that have been widely ""speculated"" but were never even mentioned. But if the people involved are alive, I suppose telling is gossip and bad manners.<br/><br/>And then he kills himself. I cried mostly because Mr Curtis deserved better. I'll say it again: the beautiful dead deserve our respect and fairness."
"rhinocerosfive-1","5","8","17","1 February 2008"," love will tear (this review) apart
","This is the movie Joy Division deserves - a mediocre biography of a mediocre band. Nothing personal, but come on. We're not talking about the Stones and the Maysles here. It's Joy Division. Joy Division isn't a big deal. Joy Division isn't the Sex Pistols. Joy Division isn't the Clash. Joy Division isn't even New Order. Joy Division is just Joy Division - a briefly interesting band with a very light catalog, fronted by a guy whose greatest contribution to pop vocals was apathy.<br/><br/>But so what, you say; great art can be made about weak artists. I agree. At least I don't deny it. But by Anton Corbijn? The best that can be said about him is that he's a good photographer and probably a very nice guy. A couple of Depeche Mode videos do not an auteur make.<br/><br/>The casting's great, and the script is okay; but the film-maker's weaknesses, like for instance film-making, vein CONTROL with fissures. Primarily, there is no energy anywhere. The movie looks like it was made while everyone behind the camera, and most of the folks in front of it, were asleep. The concert scenes are among the most stagnant in the film, which is saying a lot. The movie drags all the time, the actors never know what speed to play (often Sam Riley appears to have been the only actor in a scene to receive direction), and ultimately the movie repeats itself for much of its final hour. <br/><br/>So, perhaps I misspoke earlier: Ian Curtis probably deserved better than this. And he got it in 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE, which, though it wasn't all that much about Curtis per se, is at least a good movie by a real director."
"grolsch","6","8","17","7 December 2007"," Not as good as it could have been 6.5/10
","This film largely will appeal to a small niche group who know and like the Joy Division music and already knew the story. The film itself is a reasonable attempt, but it is a bit drawn out and uninteresting in parts, it is no masterpiece and is not worthy of an 8+ rating, a 6-7/10 is closer to the mark.<br/><br/>Currently nearly 58% of the vote is rating this as a 9 or 10, I smell a ""ramp job"" as is the case with so many new movies on IMDb these days.<br/><br/>I also feel that the movie failed to capture the facts as well as it could have. Curtis came across as weak & indecisive and it almost seemed as if his epilepsy was an unfortunate aspect of his life that just added to his feelings of depression. Rather it was a debilitating condition that caused him immense embarrassment and feelings of guilt, self loathing and ultimately lead to deep depression. The degree of impact that his seizures had on his life were understated in the film. Some of the more interesting parts of Curtis's life were omitted or only touched upon in favor of some fairly bland sequences, the book ""Torn Apart: The Life Of Ian Curtis"" took a much more personal look at his life.<br/><br/>Also the part where Tony Wilson ""signed"" the band to his label in his own blood is a well known myth/publicity stunt."
"hanshuisman","4","6","12","12 October 2007"," Disappointing: a ""stop motion"" movie
","I do not know why this movie gets so much critical acclaim. There is just no flow. No development. Things are just happening one after another. A series of long lasting photographs. Almost every shot is beautifully arranged, but so still and 'floating'. The Characters I found not very convincing. No development and true interaction (I know in Ian's case that's to be expected). Also the timing of songs like 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' and 'Isolation' in the movie is rather........eh.... cheesy. <br/><br/>By the way, the band playing live works really well. And Corbijn is a great, great photographer."
"Superunknovvn","8","4","7","3 December 2007"," What Ian Curtis was all about
","There are two things a successful rockstar biography movie needs: 1) A well balanced mix of music and story telling and 2) an actor who can do the real musician justice. ""Control"" has both. Even though Anton Corbijn has said in advance that people looking for a movie about music would be disappointed by his film about Ian Curtis, I think he exaggerated a bit. Almost all of Joy Division's greatest songs can be heard here. The band plays them live in front of an audience, in TV studios or in a recording booth. By ""the band"" I mean the actors, and that brings us straight to Nr. 2. Like ""Ray"" and ""The Doors"", ""Control"" is another one of those movies where you wouldn't believe that the leading actor is actually doing all the vocals himself. Sam Riley doesn't only look like Curtis, he also sounds exactly like him. And he's a great actor. Had someone else played the part, Curtis might easily have come of as a self-pitying wimp (which he was to a certain degree), but Riley showed us the inner struggle of that man and made us understand why he eventually committed suicide. Samantha Morton must be mentioned, too. She plays the heartbreakingly betrayed wife of Curtis who would later write the book that this movie is based on.<br/><br/>What makes ""Control"" special, though, is that director Anton Corbijn actually knew Ian Curtis personally and it shows. What we see isn't the story of a rock star, but of a person torn between what his heart and his head tell him. Corbijn has spent almost three decades making music videos and photographing bands. His work has influenced the aesthetics of rock music as much as the ones of advertising. Although that alone didn't mean he could make a good movie, Corbijn proved that he can. ""Control"" is a well-balanced, beautifully shot movie with contained direction. The look fits the mood perfectly and there was really no one else who could have done the story of Ian Curtis and Joy Division justice as much as Corbijn did.<br/><br/>One thing another reviewer mentioned rings true though: had Curtis not been a famous musician, his life wouldn't have been very interesting. He was just a regular guy. Real regular. At least the movie makes him out to be, since none of the depths that might have been within Curtis besides the epilepsy and his love affairs are explored. That's the one beef I have with ""Control""."
"stevensj64","10","4","7","21 October 2007"," ""Here are the young men...""
","Obviously, coming from Manchester and being of a certain age this is not going to be a totally objective view, but nevertheless... <br/><br/>I really liked ""24 Hour Party People"" a lot, but I always felt the portrayal of Ian Curtis was a bit two dimensional. If you want to get a little further inside the personality of this impossibly complicated and uniquely gifted young man then you could do a lot worse than see this film. It is achingly beautiful to look at, a testament to Anton Corbijn, because 1970s Manchester was a much more bleak place than it is now. It tells the story of an intellectual trapped in working class Macclesfield who is resigned to his place in society... until lightning strikes when he talks himself into the position of lead singer of ""Stiff Kittens"" who eventually rename themselves ""Joy Division"". Sadly, by this point in his life, he is already married and when some of the trappings of his burgeoning stardom are placed in his path he starts a struggle to reconcile his 'two' lives... a struggle he will never win. What ""Joy Division"" does afford him though, is a means of delivery for his 1970s Wordsworthian poetry... something that the oft overlooked other members of the band perfectly frame with their atmospheric music.<br/><br/>This is not a glossy biopic, nor does it treat its subject matter with undue reverence. Curtis, astonishingly portrayed by Sam Riley, comes across as a tortured young man who is unable or unwilling to break off his affair with the Belgian journalist Annik Honnore and reciprocate the devotion and love of his wife Deborah. The film offers no simple answers as to why this talented young poet on the cusp of mainstream popularity would choose to take his own life. Rather it suggests a cocktail of circumstances: epilepsy, medication, torn between his love for two women, trapped between two very different worlds... that might have combined to his eventual self-destruction. <br/><br/>The last half-hour of ""Control"" is very difficult to watch. But, having read ""Touching From A Distance"", the grisly denouement is handled with much sensitivity and dignity. Unlike ""Touching From A Distance"", which this viewer could never read again, the film ends with a curious optimism and a striking visual image. They were indeed ""the young men... and never were free""... well one of them will forever remain that way and found his freedom far from this mortal coil. We are left with some 50 or so songs and now this beautiful film. I recommend it to anyone who has ever been touched by the music of Joy Division and is somewhat curious about how something so darkly beautiful could have arisen from the urban decay of 1970s Manchester."
"ProperCharlie","8","4","7","17 October 2007"," A clear view of a broken soul
","There's something about crystal-clear, black and white, beautifully composed, cinematography projected digitally that penetrates the soul.<br/><br/>In this case the souls illuminated are the same souls behind the writing, production and music of the film. That people are willing to open themselves up to such stark melancholy speaks volumes of the impact the life of Ian Curtis had on those who knew him. For those of us who knew him solely through his music and the press, this film serves as explanation of, an epitaph for, and an entrance into a troubled mind.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the illness that's focused on in Ian Curtis's life, is epilepsy. For me, what screams from the screen from the very first shots of the teenage Bowie fan in his room, is the depression and isolation that he grew up in and ultimately failed to deal with. Rarely have I seen depression portrayed so truthfully and compellingly on screen. Unflinching in showing us how he felt; that everyone wanted something from him, how no one could see the real him underneath, how he couldn't cope with both needing people around him and wanting to be by himself. He had no escape. Not from his marriage, from the band, from Macclesfield. We see this right up to his death, watching a film in which even a misfit manages to escape a life of alcoholism and imprisonment with only the help of a prostitute and a dancing chicken. This is not the 'Shawshank Redemption'. His ultimate way out was the only one he could see.<br/><br/>The greatest praise I can give this film, above even the great performances from the cast, is that it feels like it was really made in the early 80s. It has a BBC2 clunky-kitchen-sink quality ('Come to bed Ian'), that I think may be accidental, but to someone like me who lived in the UK at the time, is more redolent of the era than the twin-tub, pay-phones, and Andrew's Liver Salts in the medicine cupboard combined. It took me to another era of film-going altogether.<br/><br/>More plaudits for letting the actors perform the music themselves, adding authenticity to their roles and an evenness to the musical performances. Even more plaudits for having 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' as the only exception to this. Listening to Ian Curtis sing the words he wrote about the situation unfolding on screen before us in the sharpest of focus brings the pain he felt cutting clearly and directly into the hearts of everyone who watches this perfectly melancholy film."

"YellowManReanimated","3","5","10","19 February 2012"," A dull, clichéd movie
","Let me start out by stating that I am a fan of Joy Division. I love both of their studio albums and I feel that Ian Curtis' lyrics possess a deep and alluring poetry, despite the suggested darkness and nihilism contained within. Strangely enough I usually avoid watching films solely because they concern themselves with interesting true life stories, this is because they are usually badly done. The director feels as if s/he needs to tell the story in a particular way with particular motifs. They are usually badly paced as a result of trying to stitch together a real story whilst having to artificially give prominence to certain events, which the fans expect to see not just included but emphasised. And they generally lack inspiration as works of art in themselves, far too often feeding off the legend that surrounds the subject matter rather than actually adding anything new in terms of creativity or insight. This film is guilty of all these things and will only further entrench my reluctance to watch films about interesting true life stories in future.<br/><br/>How does this film get it wrong? Well first of all Corbijn comes across as uncreative and uninteresting as a directorial presence. His pacing is poor, there are far too many uninteresting, drawn-out scenes, particularly the one with Ian and Annik alone, which should never have made the final cut, it was so dull I thought I might go into a trance. He also fails to provide the right pacing for us to understand why Ian goes from being a bit insular but basically a pretty balanced and ambitious guy to a confused, ill, depressed, whining, self-destructive maudlin presence. It's almost as if he has a personality transplant halfway through the film, and is just one example of where this film is actually jarring. Let me also mention the cinematography. I'm not one of those people who has a problem with black and white films in any way shape or form. Films like Europa, Manhattan and Raging Bull are wonderful examples of black and white cinematography used to fascinating effect. But this film is an example of when black and white photography is a completely redundant and, yes I'm going to say it, pretentious exercise. It added nothing to the film at all, no mood, no aesthetic quality, nothing. In fact it serves to disengage the viewer from the time period which is early 70s through to 1980. You know how ridiculous the decision is when Ian's watching Stroszek, a film released in 1976 and filmed in colour, in black and white, it just adds a layer of confusion that shouldn't be in the film, we should be connecting not unnecessarily visually disconnected from the story.<br/><br/>I could talk about the lack of character development the mediocre acting from Sam Riley, the complete and utter lack of insight that we get into Ian Curtis' character, Joy Division the band and even the Manchester music scene of the 70s but I'd be here for a long while. In short there is very little that is interesting or of value in this film, a documentary on Ian Curtis and Joy Division on youtube would serve as a much better investment of your time.<br/><br/>3/10"

","The first time I heard of Control was on a blog about the Cannes Film Festival, so as a Joy division's fan I couldn't wait to see it. When I knew that it was featured in Cannes and somewhere in Milan, my friends and I could not miss it. Well we were all blown away, I think devastated is the right word for how we felt after it. We cried, we did not speak for at least an hour.<br/><br/>Before watching the film I only knew that Corbijn was a photographer and it's quite comprehensible since the photography is perfect, it's a great choice the black and white.<br/><br/>Sam Riley as Ian Curtis is simply great, he's much better as an actor than a musician =P , he catches Curtis' tormented soul brilliantly. Samantha Morton is good as always, even if I must admit that I found Deborah Curtis pretty annoying.<br/><br/>Well, in the end I think it's quite clear that I loved this film, I'm looking forward the official release to see it again and again, but I'm afraid ( for not to say sure) that here in Italy we'll have to wait a long time as always.

"jaredmobarak","9","3","5","18 December 2007"," Love will tear us apart, againControl
","Anton Corbijn has finally joined the ranks of his contemporaries Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and Mark Romanek in directing his first full-length feature. No one could have been a better choice than this still photographer and music video director of cutting edge bands like Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnyman, and, of course, Joy Division themselves with the video for Atmosphere (albeit eight years after the death of frontman Ian Curtis). Corbijn has the sensibilities to craft a gorgeous study of a man on the cusp of greatness and the humanity of himself, which keeps him from taking that next leap. The cinematography is glorious in its stark, high contrast, black and white, the performance scenes feel realistic and genuine, and he gets some monster performances from every cast member. Just a few hours ago I was once again mentioning to a friend my apprehension and dislike for biopics, and then I am treated to Control. Not only a biography that seems to truly capture the subject at hand, but also a superb film to stand alongside any genre out there.<br/><br/>Joy Division's lead singer, as portrayed hereI will admit to knowing next to nothing about the band before viewing, possibly enhancing my pleasure as there were no trace of annoyance when something didn't mesh to realitywas not your run-of-the-mill rockstar. Ian Curtis was an everyman like you and me, a fallible creature, both confused and naïve in his young age. Marrying so early in life, Curtis had a child, a day job, and a gig fronting one of the hottest bands of the time. What started as a way for expression, however, soon becomes another slice of trouble in his already crumbling life. When diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition for which he once tried to help afflicted gain employment, he begins a regiment of medication concoctions, hoping to find a combination to alleviate the suffering. Mixed with his late night shows and high alcohol consumption, both frowned upon by his doctor, Curtis maybe the only star I know to have fallen into his psychological descent from prescribed drug use. Ever more depressed as his love blossomed between his wife, child, and mistress, Curtis could never find the balance to deal with the fame and the fans. After all he gave in life and onstage, they just had one answer for himWe want more.<br/><br/>Truthfully, Sam Riley is quite a find. Whether his talent is real or just catered perfectly to this roleI'd like to believe the formerhe is amazing. Totally embodying Curtis, Riley's face is never shown with a shred of ""acting"" noticeable. His blank stares, the weak smiles, the crying, and the pain of his seizures all come across as though we are viewing a documentary. Complete with Curtis' unique dance style, it is like watching history as it happens. Credit the rest of his bandmates for adding to the realism in each performance sequence, as well as the supporting cast. I was a bit unimpressed at first with Samantha Morton as his wife Debbie, but that feeling quickly went away. What appeared juvenile and trying too hard to play 20 years old eventually came together as a pretty solid piece of work. Always great, Morton shines when the world begins dissolving around her, but her love for her husband never wavers behind the tears and anger. Besides her, mention also needs to be made for Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton. Starting as comic relief, his character plays a tremendous role in Curtis' life. While the band seemed to be unable to deal with their singer's affliction, Kebbell stays by his side throughout, doing what he can to try and keep him together.<br/><br/>Control is a remarkable achievement that succeeds by adhering to the one aspect I like in biopics, keeping it simple. We are only shown a few years in his life, the meeting of his wife and bandmates and the short-lived tenure of what was Joy Division. This capsule in time is allowed to evolve and flesh out all the emotions and turmoil that went on. From the highs to the lows, the comradery to the adultery, Curtis is always portrayed as the tragic hero he was. Everything his music did for its listeners, all the power and hope it instilled in the fans, came at a steep price. Draining himself of life and confidence and love, Curtis was never going to be able to keep the ride going into the US. Corbijn gets every moment correct, straight through to the inevitable conclusion. Never trying to shock us, he treats the ending with immense compassion and love. Subdued and heart-breaking, Curtis' demise is allowed to be as beautifully touching as the rest of his ever-so-short time on earth."
"madonnawb","9","3","5","3 December 2007"," Deep and Poetic
","There is really no other way to describe this movie but as that.<br/><br/>I really had no super high expectations going to see Control, seeing I only knew 2 of Joy Division's songs: Transmission and She's Lost Control (which was the inspiration for the title), and practically knew nothing about the band or Ian's turbulent life- let alone that he committed suicide. But suppose that's what made the movie even more enjoyable and surprisingly spectacular.<br/><br/>Sam Riley who portrays Ian Curtis was superb and spot on, and suppose so was Samantha Morton as his wife Debbie (even though her role was not as heroic and was actually quite annoying in some parts of the movie- but suppose that was her role so kudos for doing it so well).<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that the movie was shot in black and white which added to the poetic landscapes, enhanced the mood and the effects of the time it was set in. In a lot of autobiographical movies on music singing and performing scenes can be the demise of the film (either cuz the actor is not as good as portraying the performer or it doesn't feel real, or is simply comes of as out of place and forced), but in this movie the music scenes were perfectly collaborated and performed by everyone involved.<br/><br/>Once again, Sam Riley was spectacular at both Ian's impersonation of movements and voice, as well as his mannerism and the turbulent personal life- battling with responsibilities of family (leaving his loveless marriage with Debbie for another woman), the growing pressures of band and performances into which he pours all of himself, and of course the struggle with frequent seizures that threaten to take over his life completely.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie not only to music fans but anyone looking for a deep, realistic and moving picture."

","Much debate was had at the time as to whether Joy Division's second album ""closer"" was pronounced with a soft s, as in; nearby, or a hard one as in; the end. Of course the latter won through because of the inevitable consequences of Ian Curtis' life.<br/><br/>I was a ""fan"" of Joy Division at the time, being of an impressionable age (IC died on the day of my 18th birthday) but I was nowhere near as influenced by them as I was by Hooky and the boys when New Order took over. Indeed Blue Monday is probably my seminal song of all time.<br/><br/>So, I didn't go into the movie theatre all agush.<br/><br/>If anything, what I might have gushed at would be Anton Corbijn's cinematography, because I was more in awe of him as NME's seemingly resident photographer than I was of Joy Division.<br/><br/>However, for the first two acts of this movie Joy Division rose above my love of New Order because this was Joy Division - not a Joy Division tribute band. It was Joy Division because Anton caught them as he did in 1979, albeit a little less grainy. No question.<br/><br/>Their music rocked, but more importantly rolled. Joy Division's drumming is often overlooked because Ian Curtis took centre stage so powerfully, but make no mistake, Stephen Morris was an integral part of the Joy Division sound.<br/><br/>So, to the film. Anton Corbijn you would hope/expect to cinematograph well, but direct? Oh yes.<br/><br/>Oh yes he can direct.<br/><br/>He does of course have the talent of Samantha Morton at his beck and call and she has guaranteed a BAFTA for this one. She is brilliant.<br/><br/>At the start of the film she is a dippy love-stuck teenager, and believable with it. As the film progresses she deals with the disintegration of her marriage in about as understated and believable way as you could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Now, Sam Riley, as Ian Curtis looks the part. That is well documented. But he also plays the part. It would be so easy to go OTT in this performance, but he controls it (perhaps a clue from the movie title).<br/><br/>His performance is quite simply, immaculate.<br/><br/>As act three and the real point of the film unfolds we lose Joy Division and we find the Curtis' and the Belgian lover of Curtis in a true love story. It is moving, beautiful, sad and nailed! Totally nailed. And for a movie bio pic to do that one can do no less than award 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>Stunning."

","This biopic by famed photographer Anton Corbijn about the late Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, looks sharp and is likely to please fans (it already has an 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb). Though ostensibly based on his widow's memoirs, it delves into many areas of the singer's life that she never gained access to, such as his life on the road and an intense love affair therein. CONTROL, unlike the Corbijn-directed music video for Joy Division's ""Atmosphere,"" made 8 years after Ian's suicide, doesn't seem to want to push the myth of Ian Curtis further, but merely to photograph it. Corbijn, known for snapping some of the only photos of Joy Division, has said that he was a smitten, impressionable fanboy at the time--and this movie clearly grew out of that experience. It is as if the only way Corbijn could feel artistically in charge was to shape his actors in to veritable band members (the actors play and sing and dance Joy Division's songs themselves) and then simply photograph them like he would U2 or Miles Davis or, well, Joy Division. The effect is good-looking, but the movie isn't so much about the music, or the band playing it, as about Ian's troubled life off stage: epilepsy, booze and the consequences of an early marriage and fame. Due to a lack of pathos, the movie often seems to be merely glamorizing doom, and if we can't be there for the music, we are apparently supposed to be entertained by suffering."

","*** NO SPOILERS YET *** I'll put my spoilers below this summary.<br/><br/>I would've given ""Control"" a 10 for the following 3 reasons. (1) Sam Riley's acting. (2) The re-creation of the music live on stage by the actors. (3) The cinematography, which looked so much like Anton Corbijn had done it himself. Stunning.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the movie was a 10, but the last 1/3 made me give it an 8.<br/><br/>Oh, and I had a minor qualm with the portrayal of Peter Hook at times. (I've heard rumors it might be true, but who cares!) If you know NOTHING about Ian Curtis and/or Joy Division and/or Anton Corbijn, DEFINITELY GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It's a beautiful film.<br/><br/>And now for some personal thoughts and recollections, for those who DO know the history regarding the aforementioned folks and entities! *** SPOILERS BELOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE BAND JOY DIVISION *** I'll share some personal stuff first.<br/><br/>I missed seeing Joy Division by only ""THIS"" much. (I still regret it.) My current partner of 27 years, ML (www.imdb.com/name/nm0422314/), saw Joy Division in England during their Feb 1979 tour. When I met ML for the first time later in the summer of 1979 he said it was the greatest live band he had ever seen in his life. And to this day he still says it. (And we were and are EXTREMELY active with seeing live bands, it would blow your minds, lets just say we won't be retiring EVER.) When I saw the posters for that period in the background shots I nearly died. When ML watched the live segments, he was blown away. Other than the crowd size in the venues (which he said was actually half-full when he saw them) the performances were dead on.<br/><br/>We lived and loved during Joy Division. I met ML via Joy Division. The first cassette tape ML made as a gift to me to impress me (Awwww!) contained ""Transmission"". And Tony Wilson made a copy of the not-yet-released first album on cassette and gave it to a friend in the US who gave a copy to ML, with permission of Wilson, because ML was one of the, if not the, first person in the US who truly loved them. And so I heard that album long before its release, was puzzled by its bleakness and lack of stereotypical ""punk"" qualities (the attitude is there, of course), and fell in love with it. Tons of playing in our car, it was worn out just before the actual album came out and the tape could be replaced! So along comes the part where the band in the movie plays their first live gig, using that same song, ""Transmission"". I started crying. Why? Because this movie has all of the EMOTIONS of that period, and I started reliving them, right there in my movie theater chair. I could remember that past so vividly. It wasn't the first time that had happened to me in a movie (""24 Hour Party People"" too), but this was the greatest moment.<br/><br/>Note that I have seen lots of footage of Joy Division, but only as much as any fan of theirs can get their hands on these days. Nothing from vaults and such. (MAN do they need to make a movie from THAT stuff, if it exists.) Then there was sadness. Joy Division was scheduled to play here in Los Angeles at the Starwood during the scheduled first US tour. And the LA date was June 9. On ML's birthday! So when we learned, just a few weeks before that date, of Ian's demise... well, enough said.<br/><br/>But then, happiness, and ML got his wish. He managed a band back then, BPeople (from Pasadena), and he was able to get them as the openers for New Order at their very first gig in Los Angeles, 11/6/81 at Perkins Palace, in Pasadena! I still have a promo poster for the show.<br/><br/>Like I said, this band (and MANY others) was pivotal to our relationship at the time.<br/><br/>So I have to EXCLAIM LOUDLY, if you are a fan of all of these persons and entities in the past and present, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You'll LOVE the first 2/3.<br/><br/>Now quickly about the last third. The movie becomes soap-opera-esqe regarding the feelings of the wife (the woman who wrote the book the movie is based upon) and the mistress. While watching I got into it partly, but it just went on way too long. And the ending scenes of Ian's death, they didn't work as much as I had hoped. Not that I wanted to see him die, I'm glad they didn't show it. It's just that it wasn't really as impactful as it should've been.<br/><br/>ANYWAY....<br/><br/>I think you see that I liked it enough to recommend it.<br/><br/>Hope I didn't bore you with the personal stuff. I rarely blog (I currently have my recent first-ever blog posted at the Interpol fan site, what a coincidence, HA) so I felt compelled to write this SOMEWHERE, and IMDb was the winner (or loser?).<br/><br/><ul><li>Skip</li></ul>"
"mdesouzalino","9","3","5","20 October 2007"," Is this the best rock biopic ever?
","I am a Joy Division fan, but I knew little about Ian Curtis' life until I saw this movie. It is a genuinely touching and beautifully shot portrait of the lead singer from one of the bands whose sound defined the 80's, and which is still being mentioned as an influence by today's bands. I was familiar with Anton Corbijn's work from the U2 albums and videos, and I was genuinely surprised with the quality of the end result, considering two things: this is his debut feature and another, not so obvious - he is a Dutchman and yet he captures perfectly the atmosphere of 70's north of England. No mean feat, I would say. As almost every English teenager in 1973, Ian Curtis wanted to be David Bowie. Then he meets Debbie, whom he married when he was still barely out of his teens. Pressures on family life, work, playing in a band and epilepsy eventually take its toll on Ian Curtis. If there is any justice in the world, this will do well at the Oscars - Sam Riley and Samantha Morton are superb in their roles and deserve nominations. Also the photography and soundtrack should be nominated, which would get Joy Division's music finally recognised in the United States by the wider audience which it deserves. I cannot honestly remember of a recent rock biopic which has been shot with such sensitivity and brilliance. Even for non-fans I would recommend this film. Johnny and June is also a fine movie, but Johnny Cash was no rock singer (even though he had he attitude and lifestyle of one). Oliver Stone made a real mess with The Doors - I wonder what Anton Corbijn would have done with that material, considering that there were some similarities in both band leaders - they were both charismatic, into poetry, and tormented with their demons. In short, I highly recommend it."
"rajdoctor","8","3","5","17 October 2007"," Control
","Lots of time without much fanfare some movies are released, and amidst all the new movies  lots of time they get lost. It requires special skills to keep your sense open to read reviews from papers and friends to identify and be aware of some good movies are running. Control falls into that category.<br/><br/>This is a true story of British iconic signer Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) who is young, ambitious and dreamer. At tender age of 17-18 years gets involved with his friend's fiancée Deborah Curtis (Samantha Morton), and marries her. Parallel to that his career builds up as a lead singer with a small group called Joy Division. Years pass by and Ian gets involved with a journalist Annik (Alexandra Maira Lara) who comes to interview the rising stars. Ian troubles increase when he faces the terrible epileptic attacks. He is under pressure to deliver professionally  something new every time he is on stage. He does not feel the same passion with increasing commercial pressures. Ian remains confused and is not able to decide between his wife Deborah and his lover Annik  to both he hides his emotions and starts telling lies. In that depressed state  he starts drinking (which is bad for an epileptic) and feels falsely rejected and hated by everyone around him  finally leading him to get miserably drunk, and after a severe epileptic attack, commits suicide by hanging himself.<br/><br/>This movie is co-produced by Ian's wife Deborah Curtis, who has also written a biography Touching from a Distance  on which the movie is based. This is Dutch still camera photographer and music video maker turned Movie Director Anton Cobijn debut movie. He has done a marvelous job as a Director. The movie is shot in Black and White by cinematographer Martin Ruhe (I thought Anton would shoot the images himself). But the screen canvass is wonderfully shot  each image looking like a post-card perfect picture.<br/><br/>A special mention of the musical score used in original of Joy Division band. It is reminisces of 70's era and music.<br/><br/>Sam Riley digs deep into the psyche of Ian's character and one can not imagine Ian being any different from Sam. Brilliant role and performance which is well supported by all the other cast! Sam has already won 1 award for this role and the movie gathered 7 awards totally, and I think there would be more to come.<br/><br/>Hats off to Anton Cobijn to delicately handle this difficult subject of a singer's 4-5 years short life with such finesse! (Stars 7.75 out of 10)"
"seawalker","8","3","5","15 October 2007"," Excellent film. About time I finally got hold of those Joy Division albums
","In 1980 a music legend died.<br/><br/>The legend was a man considered by many to be a poet, a visionary and a genius. A man whose band challenged and extended the boundaries of what could be done with popular music. This was a man who, at the time, influenced an entire generation of musicians and whose shadow still hangs large over much of the music produced today.<br/><br/>This man's sudden death shocked me deeply. I still think of all of the great music that would never be heard and the full career that would never be.<br/><br/>Sorry? What was that again?<br/><br/>No. I'm talking about John Lennon. Frankly the death of Ian Curtis meant diddly squat to me at the time. True, I had heard of Joy Division, and I rather liked ""Love With Tear Us Apart"", but beyond a general sadness upon hearing of the death of a man at such a young age, Ian Curtis' death didn't touch me at all. I do remember Tony Wilson on the radio, during this time, denying that Joy Division were going to split up because ""the other three guys are really talented musicians and have already started to write new songs"". I remember thinking that that was a little cold and unnecessary, almost as if it didn't matter that Ian Curtis had died. Business as usual.<br/><br/>I cannot claim to be the biggest Joy Division aficionado in the world, simply because I still really only know a handful of their songs. My favourites are ""Transmission"", ""Atmosphere"" and ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". (The popular ones?) I went to see ""Control"" because the snippets of the Joy Division story in the movie ""24 Hour Party People"" intrigued me and I wanted to know more.<br/><br/>In execution ""Control"" couldn't have been more different from ""24 Hour Party People"". If this had been the 1960's ""24 Hour Party People"" would have been late 60's, freewheeling, loud, energetic and psychedelic, with ""Control"" being early 60's, Alan Sillitoe, kitchen sink, grim, eee-lad-it's-grim-oop-North drama shot in expressionistic and beautiful black and white and probably starring Tom Courteney or Albert Finney.<br/><br/>Did I say grim? Not all of it. ""Control"" is shot through with a very black Northern humour. Toby Kebbell as legendary Joy Division/New Order manager Rob Gretton is absolutely hilarious, be it berating the abilities of an early Joy Division manager or trying to convince another singer to replace Ian Curtis onstage mid gig. Joe Anderson is also very funny as Peter Hook, especially when trying to wind up Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson - less comical than Steve Coogan, but effective) or expressing his annoyance about name of the punk band the Buzzcocks.<br/><br/>Sam Riley has received unqualified plaudits for his performance as the tragic Ian Curtis, and so he should. He was absolutely brilliant. An astonishing physical resemblance to Curtis (much more than Sean Harris in ""24 Hour Party People""). He moved like Curtis and sounded liked Curtis. (I don't know if it is true I'm told that the guys playing Joy Division in the film actually played their instruments live. If it is true, good for them. They sounded like a real band.) It might be the performance of his Sam Riley's life. I hope he turns out to be a great actor and impresses in other great films.<br/><br/>Outside of the above, ""Control"" generally had a great all round cast. Especially Samantha Morton who was great as a kind of innocent Deborah Curtis. Trying to build a life of domesticity for herself, her husband and baby, but losing out to the pressures and temptations of a music business lifestyle and Curtis' inner demons. Fantastic, straightforward and as real a performance as you could hope to see in a modern film.<br/><br/>One of the final shots of the film was interesting. The three remaining, grief stricken members of Joy Division sitting (in the pub?) Stephen Morris' girlfriend joins them at the table. She puts her arm around him. The camera lingers on them. The first shot of the fledgling New Order.<br/><br/>Excellent film. About time I finally got hold of those Joy Division albums, isn't it?<br/><br/>Go and see."
"LondonCalled","8","3","5","11 October 2007"," No one walked away in silence
","Attempting to marry the rock film genre with sincere romance is perhaps as ambitious as expecting a teenage marriage to survive rock fame, yet all four of those elements drive this passionate work.<br/><br/>Control focus's on the life of Warsaw / Joy Division's lead singer Ian Curtis from the release of Bowie's Aladdin Sane in April 1973 until the 18th May 1980. Along the way, we have fun with 70s male underwear, witness love  and a band - germinate and grow, before pressure from both see the skies darken and life rains on everyone's parade.<br/><br/>A brief word of warning; take what 40+ year old English reviewers say about this film with a shovel of salt; professional or amateur, we all have too much emotional attachment to the time and place to be anything other than, as Peter Bradshaw says in The Guardian, ""walking on air"".<br/><br/>Concerns first, it felt like script opportunities were manipulated to ensure posterity smiled on the still living. There were scenes that felt worryingly akin to 'product placement' Examples; we learn Bernard Sumner designed the iconic 'An Ideal for Living' EP cover  check, Tony Wilson 'discovered' the band and even gave blood to sign them  check, it was Ian's idea  not Deborah's  to get married so early, to have a child when they did and, lets not forget, it was also Deborah's money that financed the studio time when they were no names and penniless  check, check and check.<br/><br/>So do lets remember Ian's wife Deborah Curtis wrote the book (on which the film is based) and co-wrote the script, that the reputation of Tony Wilson and Factory Records is not unassociated with the subject matter.<br/><br/>Also, the storyline was simplistic; reduce the plot to essentials and it's a BBC kitchen sink 'Play for Today' drama circa 1965 in which hometown boy jumps in a minibus with the lads, goes off to a rugby tour / European Cup final / stag weekend, falls for an exotic foreign lass and well, we know the rest - in genre or, in this case, literally.<br/><br/>Turning to the strengths, there is a determination to avoid sentimentality that is close to heroic. Nothing contaminates. Thus we don't see Deborah's life outside the house  friends, family, work  with one exception, a colleague's housewarming party, though even this momentary context also serves as the device by which Ian implicitly informs Deborah of his infidelity. There's little more of Ian's life beyond Deborah and the band, and that which we do see is relevant (to his lyrics as much as anything).<br/><br/>Yes it worked, it really worked, but I'm still left with a simple and familiar love story embellished with a blindingly good soundtrack and lots of cool images.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention Bernard let Ian have his spare room ""for as long as you need"", that Deberah, the domestic martyr, struggled with a twin tub into the 1980s, that Ian and Hooky seemingly never had a cross word . . . Overall the film is like the band: tight, spare, committed and in black and white, but there was also a sense of people not walking away in silence."

Absolutely magnificent. And produced with such loving attention to detail. The film brought my memories of those days cascading back. The way the film addressed the complexities of Debbie's marriage was astounding, also.<br/><br/>And John CC. How cool is that! I only wish that Ian, Rob, Tony and Martin were still around to see how much we love them everlastingly. This film will go on to reap great rewards; such a shame they won't be there to share it with us.<br/><br/>Thanks most of all to Debbie, Natalie and New Order. And Anton. A work of genius.<br/><br/>Classic line - Rob to Ian: Well, it could be worse; you could be lead singer of the Fall.<br/><br/>Love to Macclesfield and Manchester from a lily-livered Londoner."

","I was really disappointed by this movie. I have been watching many British and irish independent films that I haven't seen before. This film won several British Independent Film Awards, and I am really surprised by these accolades. The film, for me anyway, was dull and unexceptional. The performances were monosyllabic (slow slow slow). I didn't particularly care about any of these characters and I wanted to do so. I was particularly shocked that Toby Kebbell somehow won the supporting actor/actress BIFA award - where is he in this movie? His Rob is only in the movie for 3 or 4 minutes, as far as I can tell - his one-liners fall flat to me and there is no character development whatsoever. I've enjoyed Samantha Morton so much in so many wonderful movies but she's dull and lifeless here. I was especially disappointed in Sam Riley's central performance - he has no charisma. Either the camera loves you or it doesn't (for example, I saw The History Boys on stage and Samuel Barnett radiated stage performance energy; then I saw the movie, and the camera simply loved Dominic Cooper - it's the whole Marilyn Monroe thing, when she can't remember her lines but the camera loves her so much it doesn't matter). The music isn't my type of music but it's O.K. I didn't hate the music. Has Anton Corbijn directed any more movies? He won both the best director BIFA award and the Best Debut director award as well - but why? All four of the other films that were nominated for Best Independent Film were exceptionally good: Eastern Promises, Hallam Foe, Notes On A Scandal and When Did You Last See Your Father? Sarah Gavron's direction of Brick Lane was lyrical and beautiful and the other 3 nominees were David Cronenberg for Eastern Promises, David MacKenzie for Hallam Foe (seek this movie out, it's a real gem starring Jamie Bell of Billy Elliot fame), and Anand Tucker for When Did You Last See Your Father? (this last one is the most traditional and seems more mainstream to me). But I didn't start to watch this movie thinking I wouldn't care for it; I almost always stick with it (although I didn't with In The Loop, which I hated hated hated). It's interesting to read the different opinions on here about these movies. If there were a heaven, for me it would be getting to see all the movies, theatre, and listen to all the music I haven't gotten around to in this lifetime! (:"

The whole film from start to finish was immaculate, the music......... well, if you like Joy Division, you'll understand. The way the film is put together with the music, you can see, Curtis' state of mind through the songs, as well as the visual side.

I think they got the casting as good as digging up Ian Curtis and animating him. Sam Riley is faultless. It must be the best performance of a character role i have EVER seen. Thanks Sam! If people go into this film with preconceptions, they should leave them at the cinema door. This is the closest story of Ian Curtis' life i could imagine. Brilliantly researched. Brilliantly Casted (Possibly the best actor casted in a role in Sam Riley, FLAWLESS) The monochrome filming........ well what can i say. I think colour was invented too soon; this film has shown what movies are all about,:and how they should be. Don't let the B/W context throw you, it is filmed in BW because it suits the film. Ian Curtis was not about singing from rainbows.<br/><br/>A film of a love story between his wife, his band and his mistress. Thats how i see it.

","The tragic life of Joy Division's Ian Curtis comes to life in the bleak black and white 'Control'. Anton Corbijn's debut film places a microscope over the singer's short life, and it's a perceptive and significant entry to the biopic cannon. Bolstered by a fantastic and even haunting performance from Sam Riley, 'Control' is a difficult but admirable effort to shed light on one man's mysterious life.<br/><br/>There's a quality to 'Control' that almost forces its viewer to watch from a distance, and I feel this was an intentional choice. Ian Curtis, by today's standards, would be labeled as one of those introspective emo boys. There seems to be a fiery passion underneath, but he's almost shut off to the rest of the world. Riley's tremendous performance at times comes off as frighteningly realistic, but through all his personal torment, he comes off as a distant and detached person who's difficult to read.<br/><br/>One may almost feel empathy for Curtis' situation in life. He is at once being pulled between two very different worlds. Life with his wife and daughter or a promising band on the brink of international stardom. The script, co-written by Ian's real-life wife Deborah Curtis, portrays the singer as an increasingly unhappy man. Trapped in a life he can't seem to escape either which way, a life he has no control over. His own selfishness and health complications hurt those who loved him most, and Samantha Morton's performance as Deborah is a painful and heartbreaking thing to watch.<br/><br/>Photographed in black and white, the absence of color seems fitting. 'Control' doesn't intend to explain or rationalize Ian's decisions in life, it is what it is. His eventual suicide at 23 is one that leaves us with a pang of emptiness but not surprise. 'Control' is a tragic story, and a profoundly difficult piece of work. It doesn't look for the light at the end of the tunnel, it's a picture that comes to a screeching halt as the life of another ends. There are no Hollywood fix-ups, no glamor.<br/><br/>It is such a realness that makes 'Control' difficult to judge. One knows after watching that they have witnessed something very special, no matter how brutal it may have been. Art isn't always beautiful, 'Control' certainly isn't. But it is art.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","This was easily the best biopic I have seen in a long, long time. Anton Corbijn has been one of my favourite photographers for a long time, but I had no idea that he had this kind of cinematic beauty in him as well. There are images here that are simply striking, and incredibly memorable, (such as the long shot of Ian's back with his newly-made ""HATE"" jacket); things that I am not likely to forget anytime soon. In addition to Corbijn's camera work, the acting talent here is top notch. Riley plays a convincing Ian Curtis and gets everything about the man--including his spastic march-on-the-spot stage movements--down almost to eerie perfection. Fans looking for a touching ode to Ian Curtis may want to steer clear, as its brutally frank and honest depiction of him may leave some feeling as though he was placed in a negative light, but fans looking for an earnest portrayal of one of the 20th century's most tragic pop music figures should find plenty to hold their interest."

But I was captivated by listening to the lyrics, especially as I saw his life unfold.<br/><br/>He married too young, was not ready to be a father, and really didn't understand love. So, what makes him different from the rest of us besides the fact that he fronted a band for a short time? Really, nothing. He shares the same problems the rest of us have, save one. He developed epilepsy in his early twenties, and had the fear of a worsening disease on top of all his other problems.<br/><br/>You could hear it in his music. He knew that he was losing all control over his life and he wanted to take final control. You could feel his pain and know that maybe you were a little lucky with your problems in that you can still have some control, but you also could know that maybe he was a little lucky to have his star shine even for a brief time."

","I was not privy to Ian Curtis or joy division prior to watching this movie, but I am now.
The start of the movie was a yawn, but I was more intrigued as it went on. The Dim lit, slow, minimal angle style worked for this, and becoming a fan of their music since, realise now worked perfectly. We don't need no Hollywood-esque, big ticket box office smashes to depict a musicians life, we much appreciate filming it how it is, or perhaps was."

"latinfineart","9","1","1","31 August 2017"," A powerful study of a disturbed, creative genius. Really worth watching.
","This was a truly outstanding film. Granted I am a huge fan of this genre, period, and feel that some the music that came out of the UK in the 1970's and 1980's was hugely influential, important, and absolutely timeless. Of course, there is no arguing the influence Joy Division had, and their subsequent follow up act, New Order. Curtis was able to evoke such emotion, such power, more than likely due to his state of mind, and the chaotic emotional state he had to endure.<br/><br/>Shot in gorgeous, classic black and white, the Ian Curtis biopic doesn't seem to care if you like Joy Division, the influential post-punk band Curtis fronted. It simply presents a taut, emotionally wrenching narrative. And I never really got the post punk genre title. Is that the best they could do? How about pre-electronica? Or crazy inventive. Or mind numbingly stupendous? <br/><br/>Joy Division released only two proper albums in its short history, but the group disproportionately influenced the music that followed. Fans will enjoy the re-creations of seminal shows and recording sessions, staged with authority by director Anton Corbijn, who photographed the band and its peers in the '70s and '80s.<br/><br/>But even non-fans will appreciate the cinematography and note-perfect performances, which seem to evoke a certain dread of 1970s working-class England. We see young Curtis, played with appropriate understatement by Sam Riley, worshiping David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed in his bedroom in Macclesfield, England, in 1973. He tries on makeup, smokes endless cigarettes and carefully organizes his darkly poetic writing into binders. Who knew what an extraordinary songwriter he was to become?<br/><br/>Riley's performance immediately sets the tone, his giant, uncertain eyes rejecting our sympathy and attempts to reduce him to an archetype. He marries his high school crush, Deborah (Samantha Morton), at age 19 as his band (first called Warsaw) slowly ascends.<br/><br/>Curtis' inner life, rendered through rich, stifling close-ups, is wracked with guilt and self-doubt, whether it's for cheating on his wife with the beautiful French gal Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara) or dealing with his worsening epilepsy and obsession with mortality. He is obviously in a lot more pain that we know, and does a reasonably good job of showing it.<br/><br/>The film is a quiet study. It is ponderous at times. But, in the end, it is a strong, self assured film, that really hits the mark."
"emilywes56","8","1","1","26 July 2017"," A closer look
","I only need to say a few words for this film. Beautiful photography, I love the fact that it is shot in black & white. The main characters are very good for their parts- even if Ian's eyes were a strange blue color and actor that plays him have dark colored eyes-, great depiction of England in that time. If the movie is following the exact true events of Ian Curtis's life I understand that he was in love with the reporter Annik but he felt a great responsibility and need to stay with his wife and daughter. Due to this, he may feel that he has failed as a man, husband and father (Natalie hates me, he thinks of her daughter even if she is only one year old) and that he hurts people and he is not happy anymore. Moreover, he faces epilepsy and takes strong medication for that, important factor for his up and downs in his mood, or his rise of depression. He also is afraid that his illness might kill him someday. He is suddenly getting famous all over the continent and he can not manage it very easy. Fans of the band and avid listeners of his songs are violent and demanding (we can see it in the scene where he is not ready to go out and there is another man singing in his place). So, I am following the story of a sensitive man, low-profile, but there is not a sign of depression before all this things happened. So, the cause of hanging himself, after his wife refused to stay with him even if he loves someone else, is still a mystery to me. There are many factors that contributed to his act. But, I guess, we will never find out or solve his one of a kind soul."

","Having been on a roll with watching music biopics recently (this, 'Sid and Nancy', 'What's Love Got To Do With It', '24 Hour Party People', 'Great Balls of Fire!', 'I'm Not There', 'Notorious' and 'Nowhere Boy'), 'Control' of those films was the best.<br/><br/>Like most of the films mentioned, 'Control' is a divisive film, most loved it while others disliked it. As said, personally was one of the people who loved 'Control'. Not going to say that 'Control' is perfect because it isn't. It does drag and lose momentum in the final quarter and it did run out of gas at the end in terms of pace and drama where things got predictable.<br/><br/>However, 'Control' is an excellently made film, every part of the cinematography and images beautifully framed. There is a real evocativeness of it all. The music is absolutely exceptional as to be expected.<br/><br/>Enjoyed the surprisingly earthy humour, while dramatically there is a lot of heart, affecting intimacy and humanity. Those elements that director Anton Corbijn brought was a huge part of the film's appeal. Corbijn directs very strongly.<br/><br/>Sam Riley is utterly convincing as Curtis, a multi-layered and moving performance that balances Curtis' hyperactive stage persona and tortured personal life without a qualm. Matching him every step of the way is Samantha Morton in a poignant and resilient turn that one can really relate to.<br/><br/>In summary, excellent and the standout biopic on viewing music biopics recently. My favourite biopics ever are 'Amadeus' and 'The Elephant Man'. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","1","26 June 2016"," the enigma of Ian Curtis
","It's 1973 Macclesfield, England. Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is a quiet enigmatic student. He marries Debbie Woodruff (Samantha Morton) in 1975. He works as an employment agent. On June 4, 1976, they attend a small Sex Pistols concert. Also in attendance are Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason. Ian joins them as their lead singer. They call themselves Warsaw and eventually Joy Division.<br/><br/>There is a sense of disconnection from this movie and a mystery about Ian Curtis. Sam Riley's performance, the long takes, and the black and white photography all make Ian an enigma. It's a slow burn but compelling. The tone is sad and respectful. It's very fitting of the band and its music."
"marshalzz","9","1","1","29 November 2015"," Collapse of a talented musician is happening before our eyes.
","Film has been waiting for so long for me to watch it. Finally the time has come. And you can't call this time was wasted. Control tells the story of seven years from life of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's vocalist. Film was directed by the photographer of the band, Anton Corbijn and the script is based on a book of Deborah Curtis (Ian's wife) - Touching From The Distance.<br/><br/>We need to start from this, that black and white vision was a really hit idea. Colours would only disturb in giving back the climate. Film starts from appearing the Ian's adolescent experiences. Thank to this observation, a spectator can get to know him and the environment he's living in very well. We meet his family and his mates (inter alia, future co-members of the band). Then, we melt more and more into the life of the main character, which makes us his friend, someone who knows him best. Bitter, stretched in time collapse of a talented musician is happening before our eyes.<br/><br/>We're witnesses of a range of emotions which Curtis is living, just in the first minutes of the film. Historical events (the band arise) are made with us, we participate in Joy Division's concerts and intimate moments of the character when he's alone with his own thoughts. All Curtis' feelings and reactions affect us. We experience and survive with him. As spectators, we're sucked inside. We're not only the watchers but we upgrade to the rank of co-heroes of the action. The fact that music isn't only a background but also a story, help us with it. Songs are perfectly fitted in plot and every frame is deeply emotional.<br/><br/>Watcher which doesn't get the context and is not familiar with the band's music, simply shouldn't watch it. He has to be soaked (at least a little) with the conception and post-punk seventies. Film is worth something more than being watched by ignoramus who just won't understand it.<br/><br/>Every frame seems to emanate depressiveness and this specific climate which I'm associating with Joy Division's music. I have no idea how come film creator made it but I'm enormously grateful to him for this. I enjoyed the band's work long before watching the film but after this (or even during this) I fell in love with it even more. It was awesome to hum songs during the seance and to meet the owner of this wonderful voice better. I don't know about you but I don't need more to admit that Control became, indisputably, the next one of my favorite films."

","Shot gorgeously in black and white, Anton Corbijn presents an evocative, multi-dimensional portrait of Ian Curtis which is as beautiful as it is dark.<br/><br/>Yorkshire-born actor Sam Riley steals the show, appearing two parts Ian Curtis and one part Pete Doherty. Cruel, difficult and somehow alone despite being constantly surrounded by band members as well as Debbie and Annike, Riley's Curtis cuts an enigmatic figure who you cannot take your eyes off.<br/><br/>Over its 122 minutes, Control sets up the final scene with aplomb. There is no way out, there is only one way it could end (even if you don't know the story). Bleak, but brilliant."
"kikkapi20","9","1","1","8 January 2015"," Excellent!
","Astonishingly well acted film, so much so that it seems unfair to single out any of the performances. Mr. Lawrence's camera sense is as sure and unobtrusive as his feel for acting. The movie just seems to happen, to grow out of the ground like a thorny plant, revealing the intricate intelligence of its design only in hindsight. As a JD fan, I thought it was done in a way that even non-JD fans could enjoy it. All of the actors playing the JD band members actually played their instruments and performed those songs... it wasn't just Reilly overdubbing vocals over original JD recordings! That is something that really impresses me about the skills of the actors chosen for the band. True, Curtis was a genius, but he was also human... I felt this film was grounded in reality without trying to evangelize/make a martyr out of Curtis."

","Great movie, dealing with a complex subject.

Great acting too, especially by Sam Riley as Ian Curtis. <br/><br/>Only negative thing I have to say about it is that the pacing was bit slow, esp in the latter half to quarter of the movie.<br/><br/>Another great movie to watch re Joy Division is ""24 Hour Party People"". This covers the Manchester music scene of the late 70s to early 90s, as seen through the eyes of Tony Wilson, the founder of Factory Records, Joy Division's record company. Bands covered include Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays, amongst others. Rate that movie even higher than Control, from a music history point of view."
"dierregi","9","1","1","7 August 2013"," Torn apart by love and epilepsy
","A story about a tormented young singer committing suicide on the verge of stardom is bound to have a certain appeal. However, the risks of falling into melodramatic or morbid are high. Corbijn avoids both, directing this minor masterpiece with restrain and respect for all those involved.<br/><br/>I loved the B&W photography. It recreates the atmosphere of those years, which seem long gone, the bleak but bubbling music scene, and the excitement about the new wave just about to explode. Youth having everything and not realizing how fragile life is.<br/><br/>Ian Curtis was a particularly fragile creature, both because of his epilepsy and his problem with communication. A confused boy without guidance, who wrote some of the most depressing lyrics ever, he still has a huge following. Maybe because his anguish is universally understood.<br/><br/>I am not a Joy Division fan, nor was I particularly shocked by Ian Curtis early departure. However, this movie is so well made that made listen again to their music. After more than 25 years their songs sound even more claustrophobic and depressing and I wonder how Curtis would have developed as a singer.<br/><br/>Had he lived, I doubt he could have transitioned easily into the light-hearted pop atmosphere of the late 80's. By checking out so early he became unforgettable. Even more so, with this sober but poignant movie celebrating his short time on earth."
"cat_ranchero","8","1","1","25 May 2013"," Liked it...
","Shot entirely in black and white I found this film very atmospheric and it also had a gritty realism about it. I thought all the performances were excellent with both Sam Riley and Samantha Morton taking top honours. I also have to give a mention to Toby Kebbell who totally stole a couple of scenes with some great over-the-top one-liners. The story is primarily told from Debbie's point of view and as such we get a very interesting look at the life of this enigmatic soul. This film inspired me to go out and buy a Joy Division greatest hits CD and it's music that's always been close to my heart. I should mention that all the live performances portrayed in the film were performed by the actors and so hat's off to them for making it real. Whether you were a fan of the band or not I'm sure you'll get something out of this one. Be warned though, it's quite a tough watch, even when you do know the outcome.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 8.4/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"xtian_durden","9","1","1","8 August 2012"," One of the best rock biopic.
","Control is a rock biopic about Joy Division's frontman, Ian Curtis. It is filmed in brilliant black-and-white, with superb performances from Sam Riley and from the two-time Academy Award nominated actress, Samantha Morton. The photography was superb too, it set the right tone for the era, it was bleak and depressingly beautiful. The director Anton Corbijn has photographed Joy Division in his early years, so he's familiar with them and he definitely knows how to handle a film about Curtis. It was also based on the book ""Touching from a Distance,"" written by Curtis' widow Deborah.<br/><br/>Sam Riley who was relatively unknown in that year put on a brilliant act as Curtis, while Samantha Morton became the emotional center of the film, this is the first time I saw her, and I was really amazed with her performance and so I searched her films, and I found out that she's got a great list and she had been nominated twice for best supporting actress in the Academy Awards. She played the affectionate and loyal wife, Deborah.<br/><br/>The film starts in the year 1973 in Macclesfield, England, ""I've wanted to escape it my whole life,"" Curtis said. And it ends in 1980, the year when he escaped, by suicide. Curtis is gifted with poetry, and he's got some good taste for music and films. He became the vocalist for Joy Division in their short-run. At about the age of 20, he discovered that he is epileptic, it ruined his life, made him more depressed. His marriage is also falling apart, he can't accept he's a father now, he feels that his life won't go that far, and he started to have a secret relationship with another girl, Annik. His wife had found it out, I was very sad for Debbie because she was so loyal and always caring, and she's right about what she said, ""I don't deserve this."" Curtis is so complicated, it was always his melancholy that killed him, his band was rising into fame when he took off. His bandmates and friends tried to help, but he is unsalvageable. He doesn't want to be in the band anymore and he is pressured by his life and his disorder. No one can really decipher another person, and although there are times that I felt the same way as him, I can never really perfectly understand him. But maybe just because I'm no expert, but I feel him, at some point in his life and mine, we felt the same.<br/><br/>The actors played some of Joy Division's songs, the film is filled with their live performances that again showed Sam Riley's terrific performance. The members of the band were played by James Anthony Pearson, Harry Treadaway, and one of my favorite actors, Joe Anderson. Toby Kebbel played the band manager, Rob Gretton.<br/><br/>I discovered Joy Division when I was searching ""Most Depressing Albums"" in the internet, I saw ""Unknown Pleasures"" and ""Closer"" in one of the list I stumbled with. I downloaded ""Closer"" and listened to it, then searched for the band, I was surprised that they've had only two albums, and I found out that their vocalist died at a very young age, and that caught my attention because I was interested with depression and suicide, then I found out that there is a film about him, and that is how I discovered this film. I really loved their song ""Love Will Tear Us Apart.""<br/><br/>By the way, the last film that Ian Curtis saw was Stroszek, a film that belonged to my list of greatest films."

","Every now and then there is film that becomes one of those must see movies and Control fits the bill. It doesn't matter if you were a Joy Division fan (although I happened to be) as this is not so much a film about the band-although the performances are terrific- it's a film that perfectly captures a unique period in British music history. Without waffling for endless paragraphs, Sam Riley's acting is beyond wonderful. He is an actor who accolades were made for. I've met people who knew Ian Curtis but it's not the fact that Riley is so accurate, it's the amazing emotion he puts into the role. As for the first time director Anton Corbijn, no wonder Hollywood has snapped him up."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","1","1","15 July 2012"," One of the best films I've ever seen
","""Control"" is one of my favorite contemporary musical cinebiographies ever made, ranking next to ""The Doors"" (1991) both going for a certain accuracy in terms of presentation of events, their great poetic sense in presenting their main characters and without surrendering to sensationalism, exaggerations (although Oliver Stone's film flies away with some imagination but it's good anyway) . Cinematically speaking, the film offers a view on things that are close to the object investigated, through a careful cinematography that recreates style, the period, the way we perceived the life and work of Ian Curtis and Joy Division. It's art in its great state. Most important, the man moving the whole show is Anton Corbijn, video clip director close to the Joy Division, he knew them all, and he makes of this work his film debut. He couldn't pick anything better and more appropriate for a promising beginning.<br/><br/>For the challenging role of Curtis, Corbijn has on his side the newcomer Sam Riley, who is one of most amazing talents to rise in the last years. This marks his first screen credit after a few TV movies but he stands firm on the ground by singing, acting and being Ian Curtis, the late vocalist of Joy Division. There's no one like him, so impressive, so young and already acting like a veteran. His performances carries the whole film, going through so many different stages, depressed, angry, shattered, afraid of going to the stage, romantic. We follow Riley/Curtis (gotta make this association) from the moment of start of the band, the first meetings, then writing lyrics from the things he personally felt and seen (example, how he came up with ""She's Lost Control"" after seeing a girl having a seizure on the floor at the hospital he worked), the recognition and attention the band got from Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson), the first gigs, the success and eventually his fall, and the band's dissolution (turning into New Order and the rest you can follow on ""24 Hour Party People"", which is blasé compared to ""Control"").<br/><br/>There's also room for Curtis love relationship with Deborah Curtis (played by Samantha Morton), life in family, and his love affair with journalist Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), that seems to be used as an indicative of how things got messed up for the man. From the beginning we know that he's a man with many problems, suffered with depression and seizures that often ruined his performance on stage. His lyrics evoke and paint things in a darker, sad way. Just take a look at their most famous song ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". Real artists who make genuine art must reflect themselves, in one way or the other. Curtis was all that. I'm wonder where did Riley took it all to compose his melancholic portrayal of the man.<br/><br/>""Control"" shows the dimension of Ian's problems but it leaves the real reasons for suicide to the perpetrator. Pressure, difficult in dealing with fame, the problems at home, his medical condition, the depression, addiction, who knows? All we know is that on May 18, 1980 he listened to Iggy Pop's album ""The Idiot"", watched one of his favorite films Werner Herzog's ""Stroszek"" and hang himself, leaving everything behind, becoming a rock n'roll icon, eternally remembered by his fans. He just lost control and ended all. It's not our task to judge him. A note I make to the film's great accomplish is by not showing this final moment. We see the ritual (and I want to know how all of this become a fact, with the album and the movie), he enters in the kitchen and the rest is seen through a distant shot of Deborah entering in the house. It would be too painful to see that, we like Curtis too much to see a shocking moment like this.<br/><br/>With no lost moments in it, ""Control"" is full of so many great scenes that is difficult to select just one to say that this movie is special. Walking down the streets with a jacket that says ""HATE""; the confusion during a performance where Ian couldn't go to the stage, replaced by a uncharismatic lead singer singing ""Disorder"" and booed by the crowd (the song's inclusion is not an accident); the conversations between Ian and Annik; ""Atmosphere"" for the conclusion was perfect and the band concerts, amazingly played by actors Joe Anderson, Harry Treadaway and James Anthony Pearson playing respectively Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner. Outstanding musical numbers!<br/><br/>I don't know how much of it was legend or fact or condensation of both, but the true thing I've seen here was epic and it looks and sounds completely real and believable to me. Curtis would be proud of this. 10/10 RIP Ian."

","This is one of my favorite films of all time about one of my favorite bands of all time. I heard about Joy Division randomly, through the inter-webs when I was a few years younger, and when I found out Control was in the film festival circuits, I got pumped and anxiously awaited. Awaiting anything tends to raise expectations, and I tend to disappoint easily. This movie did not do that in the remotest, to my utter surprise. This movie is beautifully shot (black and white being an amazing choice for such a bleak story set in a bleak town/time) and amazingly acted/written/scored. The band really plays well together on screen, and Riley kills it as Curtis - especially with the dancing. It was very haunting to watch, having seen docs on Ian and comparing them in my mind. He probably deserved a little more recognition than he received. Just like this film.<br/><br/>This is one of the best and (sadly) most realistic biopics ever made. It is extremely depressing, but I believe that is because Ian had the knowledge that few of us gain at such a young age (I can especially relate as I am 23 at present) that the pursuit of more, usually only leads to more sadness.<br/><br/>On the brink of super-stardom, he realized that celebrity is just another invention of distraction - a method of control, and Ian was certainly someone who had enough control in his life.<br/><br/>I think there are plenty of ways of handling depression better than Ian does, but who am I, or anyone really, to judge how he lived his life? The sad truth is, his pain comes out in his 2 albums of art so beautifully that the music doesn't even seem sad at first listen, but a quick glance at his lyrics will show you, few artists in the spotlight have ever been in more pain. RIP Ian - and major props to Anton Corbijn, a true photographer (how else could his shots be so deliberately composed?), filmmaker and Joy Division fan.<br/><br/>According to IMDb, he mortgaged his house to pay for Control - so thank you to Mr. Corbijn for having courage in your art!"

","Like many an immortalised front-man before him, the jury may remain out on Ian Curtis's talent (he even sounds like a certain Jim Morrison when he sings), but there's no denying that he was a uniquely troubled thinker. Besides, how are we to know what musical riches he may have mined, if he'd the chance to grow into a man? <br/><br/>Control is sad, yes. But it is also a call to compassion, informing us that there is a wealth of love in the wildest heart.<br/><br/>Reducing the supporting cast to sketched ciphers serves to enhance the sense of Curtis's isolation. The one other character with real flesh is Debbie, his wife, skilfully played by Samantha Morton as endlessly beaming yet bereft, with an Ian-shaped hole in her soul which will never fully be filled.<br/><br/>Real-life singer Sam Riley's performance is impressive precisely because he doesn't strive to impress; rather, he is a clenched fist of internal turmoil. We first witness his bleak romanticism as he quotes Wordsworth, gazing from a window into the middle Macclesfield distance. A few short years later Debbie is confronting him about his infidelity, and his eyes are on his feet, and he's quoting nothing, not even himself, as if the elusiveness that was once his allure has become his mind's ball-and-chain.<br/><br/>In pristine monochrome, the film portrays the brief life of a promising urban poet, from Bowie beginnings to an Iggy Pop end, via the Sex Pistols; and so, far from the usual fill-the-blanks perfunctory closing caption, the final reminder that Curtis was only 23 when he died hits us like a punch to the heart."

","This film is a surprise for being in black and white. I didn't know that they still make films in black and white. A movie from the year 2007 in black and white is very unusual. In fact, considering that nowadays's youth (and even many more grown up people) doesn't like to watch old movies (even lesser if they're in black and white), I am surprised that this was even made like this and even more with its success.<br/><br/>That said, it's time to talk about the movie in question. I watched it without knowing anything about it. In fact, once I realized it was in black and white, I thought it was a very old film, but I didn't take long to realize it wasn't old at all. The way it is made is anything but old.<br/><br/>My best friend loaned me the film. I have to admit that I knew nothing about the musician (Ian Curtis) and the band (Joy Division) in question. But with this film and later some research, I got to learn. To make a judgement on this band's type of music, they're very much like The Doors (Jim Morrison's band).<br/><br/>This movie is simply a biography of the singer and band in question, focusing on Ian Curtis's life between 1973 and 1980 (the year of his death). It deals mostly with his many personal problems, his marriage to Deborah (and a bit, but very little, on his baby's birth), the birth and rise of Joy Division, his epilepsy issue and his love affair with Annik, and his self-homicide (that is, his suicide). It closes with the words «Ian Curtis died May 18, 1980. He was 23 years old». The film's title comes from a Joy Division song, ""She's Lost Control"".<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Well, this is a rather complicated film to judge, as it often happens with biographical films (of course, I am speaking for myself)."
"CobraLaLaLa","10","1","1","23 July 2010"," Very personal, Introspective insight on one mans life and struggles
","I am usually a reader of IMDb. I can count on 2 hands how many reviews I've left concerning films I've seen. Sometimes because the movie had been summed up do beautifully by others writings that I felt there was nothing more I could add, but also, I have to move to do such a thing for a film. I am not very verse in Punk music, but in my growing time on this earth, which has been short, I've come to realize that all music is good. What I mean when I say that is that in all in genre's of music, you have good music(artist), and not so good ones. Johnny Cash, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Ian Curtis.<br/><br/>I was not familiar with him or his music, much as I was not familiar with Johnny Cash before I watched a biography on him. I like Johnny Cash, and now, also, I like Ian Curtis. Aside from the music that he created, we saw an up close and personal account, events, emotional strife and moral conflict in the soul of one person. The conflict(s) of doing whats right and expected, versus doing what's right and fulfilling. It's ironic this movie is in Black and White, because this movie is far from black and white, there's many shades to this person's life.<br/><br/>Lead Actor Sam Riley who played Ian Curtis did a phenomenal job and really conveyed the emotions and moral conflict of the character and is constant struggle to hold on to what's fulfilling and what is expected of him. At the same time, he is dealing with a health issue, that at that time, there was not really a whole lot that could be done for him. Ian died at a very young age, but did a lot in that very young age. He was married and a father, had a mistress, and was in famous band. Very young to have these kind of decisions and moral dilemma's to answer to.<br/><br/>We can see that the character was different, saw things different. It's this difference that allowed him to write the way he did and express the way he did. I am not sure where his depression came from, I know the side-effects just enhance these feelings and fears, but I do not know where they actually began for Ian.<br/><br/>Debbie, played by Samantha Morton, was also amazing. She said in the film that too her Ian isn't famous, he's just Ian, ""I still wash his undershorts"". Where as his extra marital affair Annik knows him only as ""Ian Curtis"" joy division. Both Debbie and Annik know him in 2 different ways.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was nothing short of superb. Strongest performances turned in by Sam Riley and Samantha Morton. I felt every emotion exhibited by the characters, individually and co-joined. And felt as if it was happen to me or right in front of me at times. But Sam Riley put on a extraordinary performance not 1 whisper shy of greatness. He took this script and this character and made him his own.<br/><br/>Now you see why I wrote this review. There should be not doubt in your mind if you read this far. If doesn't move me, I don't write. This movie clearly did..."

","After the 70s punk movement, new bands that were influenced by great bands like the Clash, The Buzzcocks and The Ramones. This new movement was post-punk, that combined punk and rock with other types of music, like Dub and Funk. Many bands were apart of it, like New Order and The Cure. One of the most famous was Joy Division, a band that only made 2 albums but it's influence still exist, influencing modern indie music.<br/><br/>Control tells the story of Joy Division's lead singer, Ian Curtis (Sam Reilly). Curtis was an intelligence man, reading a lot of classic novels and poetry and a writes a lot of his own stuff. He was a fan of a lot of the music from the era, like David Bowie. Early on he meets his girlfriend, Debbie (Samantha Morton), a young woman attached to his intelligence and artistic nature. Soon after he left the school, he worked at his local Employment Exchange, which he was good at, but singing and writing gets him into a new band. Joy Division quickly becomes successful and famous followed. But Curtis' life is not simple, having to battle with epilepsy, an extramarital affair and his own personal depression.<br/><br/>Control is a wonderful told story, with great acting and direction behind it. Reilly was an extremely talented actor and an excellent pick for the role, showing all the traits of Curtis, his intelligence, internal conflict, depression and his quite passion. Morton too was excellent, giving a low-key, natural performance as the shy girl who falls for Curtis. Toby Kebbell plays Rob Gretton, the band's manager, who offers a little bit of comic relief with his clever put downs and colourful use of the English, but still kept as a realistic level. Alexandra Maria Lara too is a good as Annik Honoré, Curtis' girlfriend. She too gives a natural performance as a young woman who falls for Curtis because of his artistic and musical talent. She was handled in an evenhanded manner consider this film was based on Deborah Curtis' diaries.<br/><br/>Director Anton Corbijn's background was in photography (it was good enough start for Stanley Kubrick) and music videos. Control was his feature debut and well, it was a hell of a debut. He gave the film a black-and-white, artistic look, possibly an influence from his photography: it looked good and effective, matching the grounded, sombre tone of the film. The film focuses on the characters, and Corbijn slows the film down long enough to allow the audience to absorb the drama on the screen. Corbijn makes sure that there is a down-to-Earth tone through the film. Characters are allowed to grow organically, the gig scenes are treated in a normal manner and Corbijn avoids any over-the-top music clichés about characters or the art. The band did not make loads of money, they did not live the high live and they had to travel in a beat up car. Corbijn also knew how to organise a set piece, from an excellent steady cam shot of Curtis going to work, making the mundane interesting and the gig scenes were real, like real gigs are, in small, packed areas with the tightness of a mosh pit. There is an well constructed scene when a gig crowd gets restless, feeling the tension in the air. Plus Corbijn and the writer Matt Greenhalgh treat the subject of Curtis' depression and internal artistic struggle with great sensitivity. They understand that people don't moat around and go 'I'm depress.' They are people who try keep going regardless and usually keep their issues to themselves until it is too late.<br/><br/>Finally, they is an excellent soundtrack, which is what you would expect from a film like this.<br/><br/>A must see film and you don't have to be a Joy Division fan to understand it."
"HenryHextonEsq","7","1","1","16 May 2010"," All the monochrome Manchester clichés
","""Tell me about Macclesfield..."" (spoken in sensuous Belgian accent) <br/><br/>A reasonably strong film, this; Corbijn adopting an appropriately gloomy naturalism. For a richer understanding you will also require Paul Morley's side of the story (""Piece by Piece"", his 2007 compendium of writings on the band) and a familiarity with the collected works of JG Ballard, Franz Kafka and Werner Herzog. However, this is worth watching all the same - unfolding from the perspectives of Deborah and Ian Curtis, mainly being drawn from Deborah's memoir, ""Touching from a Distance"" (1995).<br/><br/>There is some sense of the rich cultural terrain of Post Punk Britain; ""Radio On"" was clearly an influence and the soundtrack includes the Kraftwerk and Eno, to place Joy Division in their rightful context as European forces of nature (and machine). Curtis is portrayed as a self-educated working-class intellect and instinctive European who is constrained by, and yet drawn back to, his Cheshire roots. Perhaps Owen Hatherley is correct when he describes the film as a hagiography of Curtis - it does perhaps fall into the trap of many biopics that make things a bit pat and obvious. His character seems a bit simplified and reduced; perhaps due to the adaptation of a book written from one person's perspective. This is avoided in ""Nowhere Boy"" (2009), with its portrayal of the flawed young John Lennon; that film also has a more robust sense of the social context than this film.<br/><br/>Riley and Morton give expert, if predictable performances, doing their best with what they are given; as do the bit-part strollers playing the visionaries and jesters of Post Punk Mancunia: Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton, and Craig Parkinson as Mr Manchester himself, Tony Wilson. Hooky is played as a Neanderthal and Sumner as a sensitive sort, powerless to aid Curtis. Alexandra Maria Lara is competent enough as Curtis' Belgian mistress, perhaps straining for the Euro-ennui of Lisa Kreuzer in ""Radio On"".<br/><br/>Overall, this has a certain power on first viewing, though a lot of this is due to its careful assimilation of so many cherished post-punk tropes. It is too perfectly crafted to upset any boats - a kind of English Heritage simulacrum of our formerly alternative culture."
"dbdumonteil","9","1","1","24 April 2010"," Anton Corbijn's magnum opus says it all: he has kept control!
","As a keen music lover I had to discover this gem made by a celebrated photograph in the history of rock: he made photographs of Tom Waits, Captain Beefheart and was responsible for the package of R.E.M.'s Automatic For The People (1992). Without mentioning the remarkable clips he shot for Depeche Mode (see the stunning video of Enjoy The Silence). But above all Anton Corbijn knew very well the members of Joy Division during their short lifetime so he was THE man to shoot their story and the result is just terrific. Its award of the Golden Camera at the festival of Cannes in 2007 was highly deserved.<br/><br/>Corbijn shot almost everything that made Joy Division unique in the history of rock and their story is a perfect snapshot of the musical climate of that time. The end of the seventies saw the explosion of punk and new wave.<br/><br/>But is it righteous to say that Corbijn was merely interested in the history of the band? Not really. Of course, sequences dealing with them abound and they're unforgettable. See the admirable sequences dealing with the recording of Closer (1980) and the line pronounced by maverick producer Martin Hannett: ""Ian, you're a genius"" or the concerts during which epilepsy seizures Ian and makes him plunge into despair. But Corbijn was mostly interested in the history of the leader of Joy Division. In a way, his fate is comparable to Kurt Cobain's: both were married and became fathers too soon. Both were devastated by success. But unlike Nirvana's leader, Curtis was torn between his love for his wife and his mistress and couldn't deal with this forbidden love. Furthermore, as it was written before, his epilepsy seizures made him vulnerable and frail making his suicide predictable. All of this is shot in a rigorous (the listening of Iggy Pop's The Idiot, 1977 before the act...) and especially discreet manner so that we can fully sympathize with Ian Curtis' plight. And it works for the last minutes are very harrowing. I must say I shed a tear at that time of the film.<br/><br/>Then Corbijn didn't forget his science of photography during the making of his film for several shots are carefully filmed making them look like photographs. And needless to say that the actor acting Curtis is highly convincing, just like the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't really write faults about a highly emotive biopic and when a style is perfectly adapted to a type of story, it can work wonders unlike the failed biopic about Serge Gainsbourg released in January 2010."
"paul2001sw-1","8","1","1","10 April 2010"," Portrait of the artist as a confused boy
","Anton Corbijn's film 'Control', about the death of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, challenges some of rock and roll's most enduring myths. Before Curtis was famous, he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work; he got married as a boy and when he subsequently took advantage of his growing fame to attract an additional admirer, the consequent moral strain drove him to despair; and the drugs associated with his suicide were anti-epileptics. After his death, Joy Division became New Order, and famously owned a nightclub; but according to Corbijn, Curtis' life was resolutely homespun. As a tender portrait of what it's really like for a young band starting out, the film works well, and Sam Riley is great as Curtis. But some of the film's choices are less clearly correct, such as the portrayal of Curtis' birthplace of Macclesfield as the archetypal grim north, or the casting Samantha Morton as his wife; whatever her skills as an actress, she's too old for the part, and she strains too hard to convey girlishness in an apparent attempt to compensate. I'm also not sure why the film is shot in black and white. But it's certainly much more real than '24 Hour Party People', another movie about the same time and place."
"deadrose","10","1","1","1 April 2010"," Soundscapes of Emptiness
","This is a beautiful film of an achingly bleak, short life.<br/><br/>We follow Ian Curtis from April 1973 to his death in May 1980, the night before Joy Division's first American tour would have launched. Schoolboy pill-stealing hijinks and fumbling romance are punctuated with moody thoughts and a first, telling, absence seizure (petit mal) in class.<br/><br/>Ian married his sweetheart at 19, just as punk rock exploded across England and alienated teens started grabbing musical instruments and stripping the accretions off rock and roll. He joined a band with some mates, and the rest truly is history.<br/><br/>Sam Riley does such an amazing job playing Ian that I kept having to remind myself it wasn't actually him - the thin hunched shoulders that sagged lower as multiple stresses piled up, the writhing spasmodic movements onstage, all look so much like the real footage of Ian that it's quite uncanny. His portrait of severe depression is spot-on, too. The scene where Debbie confronts him and he shrinks back into himself as she backs him into a corner was familiar to anyone who's ever suffered clinical depression.<br/><br/>The lack of a score combines with the photography to provide deep, still, lonely scenes, making the viewer feel the emptiness and isolation growing within him. When the music finally comes in, it fills the space but at the same time rips at you.<br/><br/>I was a fan of Joy Division back then (and still), and so May 18th 1980 was a doubly depressing day for me - I'd been very excited that Joy Division was touring the US, and as an added bonus for us Seattleites, Mt. St. Helens decided to blow her top. A fitting memorial, perhaps."
"CountZero313","8","1","1","9 January 2010"," absorbing portrait of a talented but torn individual
","Before Morrissey and The Smiths, there was Ian Curtis and Joy Division. Their music was already retro by the time I was old enough to buy my own records; I had a vague awareness of Love Will Tear Us Apart as a decent track by a band I wasn't particularly enamored with. Although scenes of Joy Division performing and recording are copious in this film, the good news is you don't have to be a fan of the music to appreciate this assured debut from photographer Corbijn.<br/><br/>Fine acting and subtle helming make this an above-par cinema experience. Samantha Morton is spell-binding, utterly convincing as a teenage schoolgirl fumbling her way through relationships with sulky, spotty boys. A 30-year old seasoned actress giving such an utterly convincing portrayal of pubescent naiveté and guile is quite a triumph. Sam Riley encapsulates the ill-fated Curtis. The problem with biopics is we often bring our own knowledge and intimacy with the subject to the performance, daring the actor to try and push that aside. In recent years, we have seen some take up that challenge magnificently (e.g. Ali, Capote, Ray, The Queen), while other have fallen short (Goodbye Bifana). I came to Control unencumbered by any emotional attachment to, or photographic memories of, Ian Curtis, but I believed in this portrayal of a talented, poetic, troubled, conscientious lead singer of a 70s band. I do have visceral memories of 1970s Britain that the film evoked wonderfully. Ford Cortinas, flares, record players, boys in make up... Corbijn fills the frame with stark geometric lines (most obviously in exterior shots of council house high rises), conjuring up the bleakness and isolation of the times. Jim Callaghan and the Winter of Discontent are never mentioned, but they permeate every shot. There is a deft economy in dialogue; marriage is mentioned, and then happens, Ian talks about joining a band, and then sings at their gig. Given Corbijn's CV you would expect competent framing; that he is able to handle shot flow so well proves he is as good a director as he is photographer.<br/><br/>Joy Division and Ian Curtis are iconic figures in 70s and 80s Britain, pioneers in the Manchester sound and an indispensable part of the soundtrack that defines those times. The film pays off as a thumbnail portrait of one aspect of Britain's recent cultural history. More importantly, it succeeds as cinema, offering a nuanced tale of one man's demise that will resonate with audiences non-cognisant with the UKs musical heritage."

Maybe I was expecting too much based on all the great reviews but I was disappointed by this movie. It had great acting and it was well shot but the pace was just too slow for me. In particular the scenes involving Riley and Lara really dragged. Shooting it in black and white was a great idea. I also did not have a lot history of his life, so the movie did answer lots of questions for me. I was surprised to see he was a civil servant. If only there was a better script this movie would be a classic for me. But maybe on a second watching I will see more."

In other words, the film depicts perfectly the idea of actions and consequences x gravity and being suspended in air, as far as what we understand the game of society x human needs.<br/><br/>The mood is both dim and implosive. Sam Riley looks at his surroundings mostly wishing not to exist at all, and only in brief and right moments we can tell he needs gravity giving us some doses of oxygen.<br/><br/>Great character analysis with outstanding photography and acting. Interesting film even for those who are apart from Joy Division's story.<br/><br/>Note this beautiful talented woman named Alexandra Maria Lara. With her acting and charm she actually reminds me of Ingrid Bergman's in the 40's with a modern touch of Cate Blanchett's hypnotic eyes. She is also in Coppola's Youth Without Youth."

","Not Knowing much about the life of Ian Curtis I approached this one with no expectations and it blew my mind. The utter tragedy of his life set in dreary black and white 70's England is captured to perfection in what is an awe inspiring piece of modern cinema. The Characters are played perfectly and you cannot help feel sorry for nearly all of them. What was really rammed home to me was how much the cocktail of drugs he was prescribed for epilepsy affected his state of mind. Also the band and record label never took his illness seriously and saw it as a hindrance to them. The way the film intertwines the songs he wrote with his life experiences makes it all the poignant to watch. Not uplifting but i guarantee you in the final frame where you here Mrs Curtis's plea Somebody help me after finding his body you'll want to reach in to the TV and do just that.

","I can't stop thinking about this film. From the great use of suspense and minimalist dialogue, to the amazing camera work such that every single frame of this modern masterpiece (yes masterpiece) could be taken and hung on a wall in an art gallery, I love everything about it. It has been criticised for focusing too heavily on Annik Honoré and Deborah Curtis as the sources for Ian's spiralling depression, and in that sense only gives us a narrow snapshot of his short life, but I think Corbijn never strove for more than that. To me one of the superb merits of this picture is its sense of isolation which is created by such a very selective approach to its content. I feel certain, given Corbijn's access to Curtis's wife and Tony Wilson as co-producers, that Control could have told us the full, unabridged tale of Curtis's demise, yet Corbijn didn't and it is this exercise in restraint that renders his riveting film so artistically pleasing. Moreover, Riley's uncanny resemblance to the great man himself (and I feel, rather eerily, to Pete Doherty) makes it simply impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Jaw-droppingly good."

The situations Ian found himself in are so true to life, and it really is a shame he had to die so young and have such a confusing and depressing love life. But at the same time, his creative genius helped drive Joy Division to the brink of stardom (which it earned shortly before his death, and gained even more so afterwords), and it also helped to inspire a musical trend in several other artists.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people are looking to this movie as a story of the music of Ian and Joy Division, but anyone who has watched this can see that is entirely not the point. This film is about Ian's life, music just happened to be a large part of it. So although it does focus briefly on segments of their performances and songs (which, by the way, Sam Riley did a fantastic job of replicating), most of the movie deals with his relationships, his depression and his epilepsy.<br/><br/>I am glad they chose to film this in black and white, I think it added a lot to the character of the film and also made for some spectacular shots.

As someone who has lived in Manchester and worked with up & coming bands, the weight of Ian's legacy weighs heavily on the city to this day with places like the Roundhouse still showcasing talent whilst reminding people what they lost in May 1980.

I did like the Glenn Miller one and the Buddy Holly Story but even with that, Holly's wife said their courtship was laughably inaccurate in its portrayal. So what's the point? Is this social realist/ kitchen sink drama? In which case, why all the inaccuracies? I remember us all listening to that EP where Joy Division first appear (I think as Warsaw.) We kept playing the opening: ""You all remember Rudolf Hess?"" over and over again as it sounded so dodgy, what with the band's alleged ""reputation"". I'm pretty sure the song that follows is ""A Later Date"", not ""Leaders of Men."" But maybe that wasn't the case in reality. And I seem to remember the bassist telling the story of how Rob Gretton became their manager and it was nothing like the macho confrontation depicted. Just the opposite, to an amusing degree. And the band confessed the ""blood letter"" was apocryphal. Does any of this matter? Well, according to the critics you would think ""Control"" is the second coming of Tarkovsky. But there is no such poetry here as the director is a photographer turned director. Film is another discipline altogether, and the crucial failing is that Joy Division arguably have that mysterious mojo called ""artistic talent"", while the director's lack of it sticks out like a sore thumb on the screen. Why did he want to make this film? I was left none the wiser, and I heard yawns around me.<br/><br/>Do we need art? Is it in any way essential? Maybe the film is not interested in the question. The really uncomfortable aspect of ""Control"" is we know the outcome, and the songs are merely box after box to be ticked as they bring you ever closer to that event. Really quite dreadful to sit through. The whole minute by minute depiction of the tragedy was unpleasant and unnecessary, at least to me. Yes, it was sad but is this helping? <br/><br/>The final shot was particularly repulsive and seemed to allude to the controversy of their name and image, hardly touched upon in the film itself.

I feel sorry for the people in London who have to shell out almost 10 quid to see something like this. And, there was little in Anton Corbijn's cinematography to inspire artistic ooh's and ah's.

My only criticism (and this is truly nitpicking) is that the story is told exclusively from the point of view of Deborah Curtis (Ian's wife). Yes, she wrote the book on which this film is based, and yes, she co-produced the film. Perhaps seeing Ian as a poor father and husband makes him more real than if we could have seen more of the misunderstood genius. But there is very little attention paid to Ian's creative process, not enough paid to his influences/inspirations, etc. Ian's family life is portrayed as being clearly separate from his professional life. It seems strange that someone so determined to portray herself as ostracized would go so far as to co-direct a film about a character whose notoriety stems from the very thing she was ostracized from.

Most of the songs on Closer are extremely dark / somber and I kept expecting them to come into play around the last 1/3 of the film, when Ian was starting to feel despondent / depressed about his situation. I was disappointed that the producers didn't seem to deem them worthy of inclusion... The songs ""Passover"", ""A Means to an End"", ""Heart and Soul"", ""Twenty Four Hours"", ""The Eternal"" and ""Decades"" were all left high and dry which was an ""Atrocity Exhibition"" in my opinion.

When Jim Jarmusch started making movies he used black and white, long takes and stark looks at the film's characters. That's sort of what Corbijn does. It's not a stretch from his photography. Control is a portrait of Ian Curtis, possibly more as myth than actual man, but a portrait nonetheless.<br/><br/>Sam Riley has a lot resting on his shoulders in this performance, as he plays a man who is somewhat getting lost in his own world, growing distant from the world around him, often at a loss for words in every part of his life, but his music. He sees something that moves him, like a girl going into an epileptic seizure, and gazes at it and writes about it. That this film will be a blip on many US audiences' radar is a real shame because this performance is golden.<br/><br/>Control is emotional without being melodramatic. There's a simplicity in the style of the film and performances that allow emotions to flow all over the screen. But they are sad ones. If I have a complaint about the film it's that it lacks any sort of real humor. That maybe the problem with buying into the myth, but I guess with Ian Curtis's story you can't be wishing for happy endings."

","Very enjoyable movie if you´re a Joy Division fan like me, it shows some interesting details about the band and some scenes just give you a good sensation.<br/><br/>Now, talking about cinematographic value, I think this film doesn´t stand out among other rock and roll biographic films. I feel like the director could have known better where to cut or to keep filming a scene. The sentimental scenes could have been a little bit more powerful, and generally, the film had the potential to be more than it is. All things we see are superficial and I would have loved to see a more deep perspective about Ian mental problems, but it´s not bad as it is and I enjoyed it while watching it"

I was expecting a grandiose film capturing the emotions of confusion, sadness, and helplessness throughout the second half of the video when things start going downhill for Deborah and Ian's marriage after he encounters Annik, but it felt rushed and slightly comical at times. None of it felt sincere it at all, the movie didn't immerse me into the myth that Tony WIlson and Ian built for the small but impactful time Joy Division was active. Such a shame, I was expecting a movie that truly captures the reason why people love Joy Division so much. Not only that, but they didn't even get the first TV appearance of Joy Division correctly, they played Transmission instead of Shadowplay.<br/><br/>Save yourself some money and buy Deborah's book instead, it's the closest you'll ever come to knowing how things actually went down, and with great detail and sadness, as seen from the perspective of the one who understood Ian the most."

","***I posted this review also as a posting on a general thread.***<br/><br/>Though I was somewhat aware of their music and of the band as a whole, Joy Division, always existed somewhere at the periphery of my consciousness.<br/><br/>Then, a few weeks ago I walked into a record store (yeah I still enjoy buying CD's/albums) my eyes fell on ""The Best Of Joy Division"", and that was that. Ever since I bought it, I cannot stop playing it. I can't describe the music, the one word that comes to mind is amazing. The sound is so mesmerizing and engaging, the instrumental arrangements, the lyrics, Ian Curtis's voice, the rhythm, beats,the talent of each band member, Stephen Morris, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner etc. etc. etc. <br/><br/>Joy Division is like a drug, and the more you taste the more you want to taste, thereby creating an insatiable appetite that cannot ever be satisfied!<br/><br/>Though Joy Division was active only for a short time, (1976-1980) and their body of work is quite brief and not as voluminous as other bands that came together during those years, the influence and impact of Joy Division on music is in my opinion groundbreaking, monumental and unique. <br/><br/>I think that even during those days their sound was so complex and ahead of its time, that most people did not know what to do with it. People were unsure of the music of Joy Division, could not peg it to a style or classify it! Even now their sound is far ahead by leaps and bounds, and the sheer complexity of the music will assign a timeless and immortal quality to it, which will in turn ensure an always vibrant continuity to their musical legacy.<br/><br/>The influence of Joy Division is so deep and far reaching, that it is sometimes hard to quantify and qualify. It extends from Tears For Fears, Depeche Mode and The Cure (as well as virtually every band which comprised the post-punk New Wave movement) to U2, Coldplay, Keane and The Killers who also incidentally contributed their version of Joy Division's ""Shadowplay"" on the movie's soundtrack and their own compilation ""Sawdust"". These are but a few of the bands and musicians that can attribute their inspiration to Joy Division. At least Bono and U2 are graceful enough to acknowledge how much they owe to Joy Division (read the group's biography ""U2"" by U2).<br/><br/>Honestly, looking at some of today's musicians and bands (I shall not name any out of respect for Joy Division), they should be ashamed to call themselves that, they should kiss the ground the walk on a give thanks to the heavens each and every day for their existence, because when compared with Joy Division they are nothing but a bunch of talentless hacks!!!! <br/><br/>I wish Joy Division had more time to evolve, grow and reach the full potential that the band could have. Still even with the bits and pieces of their creativity out there, the brilliance of what hey achieved is unmistakable."

","What I most enjoyed about this beautifully shot film were the ways it elevated the somewhat typical life of a rock star into a more classical realm. The choice of black and white lent the film an almost archetypal quality--showing a trajectory we have witnessed time and again throughout the history of music, yet pushing the viewer to watch in the way Antonioni's masterpieces do. Although Corbijn charts a somewhat well-hewn path, his background as a rock photographer shines through, rendering clear, sleek B&W that compels long gazing. While the film is wonderfully acted, I'm not sure the actors should have performed the musical material. Watch the actual Joy Division videos, included in the bonus section, and the difference, energetically, is salient (as are the strikingly different spirits of Sam Riley and Ian Curtis). Curtis had much more of a wispy softness; Riley appears more addled and robotic, as if he's trying to convince us that he's about to seize at any moment. He is not the soft, Bowie-loving poet. However, this aside, the film is well worth viewing for those who love rock and rock photography, even if they are not specifically Joy Division fans."

","This is a great introduction to the band Joy Division and Ian Curtis' story for people who weren't of that era. I was born in 1982, and being a music follower I knew about Joy Division, I knew Ian Curtis killed himself, I knew the Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails covers of Joy Division songs. I always thought they seemed quite important to the modern music world, but watching this movie was my first real introduction, and I spent an afternoon listening to all their releases afterwards. First, I thought it was a really respectful and thoughtful movie, and quite unlike most rock star rise and fall stories. It fascinated me to learn afterwards who the film makers actually were with regard to their relation to the band historically. I liked how Mr Curtis didn't seem to be a hedonist or a showman. There's a line, something like 'those people don't know what it takes and the effect it has on me' when talking about performing, like it takes every ounce of strength and expression just to complete a show, like he really really took it seriously and needed it. This film really helped me to get the music, and give me a reference point to start appreciating it. I thought it was far more sympathetic to the subject than most films of this type, extremely well acted, and as previously mentioned, a great introduction to a band I'll unfortunately never get to see."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","0","13 March 2009"," CONTROL (Anton Corbijn, 2007) ***
","The haunting music of Joy Division transcended the band's minimal output and modest cult status among British indie bands to become a highly influential sound. Shot in color but desaturized to be shown in black-and- white, CONTROL is a carefully-made biopic of their troubled singer Ian Curtis who, at just 23 years of age, tragically took his own life to become rock's first celebrity suicide. Although I had thought that this fateful decision was taken mainly on account of his debilitating epileptic condition, the film reveals that this had more to do with the fact that Curtis, being clearly unwilling to embark on Joy Division's impending first U.S. tour, had lost control of the band he fronted for (hence the title) and, more importantly, was deeply conflicted about the two relationships he had going on at the same time  with his wife Deborah back home (who had also borne him a daughter) and a Belgian amateur journalist/groupie that followed him around when performing. Based on Mrs. Curtis' memoirs, the film by necessity concentrates more on his personal than creative life; besides, director Corbijn, a former music video helmer, knew the band members personally and creates a remarkably straightforward and affectionate portrayal of Curtis' life and times. Apart from Samantha Morton (as Deborah), the cast is virtually made up of unknowns: at first, Sam Riley did not seem to me to look much like the real Ian Curtis but, before long, he had effectively inhabited the character (down to his awkward moves during Joy Division's stage act); the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara (whom I had actually already watched in DOWNFALL [2004] and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH [2007] as Curtis' Belgian girlfriend, Annik Honore') and Toby Kebbell (as the band's overzealous manager Rob Gretton) also score in the acting stakes. Furthermore, the extraneous music is well-chosen: apart from the well-documented fact of Curtis having watched Werner Herzog's STROSZEK (1977) and listened to Iggy Pop's ""The Idiot"" (1977) just before hanging himself, we also have The Velvet Underground (another band whose musical legacy ran a similar course to Joy Division's), David Bowie (ironically, Curtis is seen listening to the chameleon artist's own crossover album ""Aladdin Sane"" [1973], written during his first U.S. tour!), Roxy Music and The Sex Pistols."

","Sam Riley's mesmerizing performance as former Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis in the bio pic ""Control"" undeniably had control as one of the best of 2007. Director Anton Corbin's cinematic take on the uncontrollable melancholic life of the un-joyous vocalist is a commendable film orchestration. Curtis committed suicide at age 23 in 1980. Corbin reveals Curtis' constant struggles with self-esteem, adultery, epilepsy, and fame throughout the narrative; starting with his post-adolescent days as a British loner to his self-destructive final act. Curtis married at a young age to gentle gal Debbie; but due to the hasty marriage, he consequently fell out of love in the coming years and suffered much self-ridden guilt from it. Curtis, still married, then meets a sexy Belgium named Annik and falls deeply in love with her even though he knows that adulterous ""love will tear him apart"". Corbin also shows us the Joy Division ""transmission"" from local band status to rock-solid popularity ""atmosphere"" status. The dialogue interactions scenes between the Joy Divisionees and their manager Rob Gretton are the film's comic relief from an otherwise gloomy rock star story. Samantha Morton's auteur work as Mrs. Debbie Curtis was one of the most powerful of the year and Ms. Morton proficiently demonstrates that she never lost control of her character. Joe Anderson, James Anthony Pearson, and Harry Treadaway were no ""dead souls"" in their performances as the Joy Division members. They just might be included in the ""New Order"" of promising British actors coming our way. And without a doubt you can book Toby Kebbell's effort as Gretton as one that definitely rocked! But it is Riley's (""believe it or not"" ""Is that really Ian Curtis?"") acting that falls as probably as the most overlooked performance of 2007. I was all hung up when Sam's stunning achievement was ""isolated"" away from the Best Actor Oscar nominees list for 2007! I guess there is so much that we can control. Now it is time for you take control and tune in to ""Control"" today! ***** Excellent"

","I recommend ""Control"" as partial detox for ""Lost"" addicts. Everybody looks and talks exactly like Charlie. Gosh, I can't wait for season 4. My second favorite thing about this movie is Sam Riley's on-stage dancing. Staying more or less in one place, he flails his fists about pretty wildly, like he's extremely mad at someone, probably himself. There's more Adam Green than Joe Cocker in the way he moves, but also more aggression than playfulness. Like he's trying to beat himself up. Did Ian Curtis really dance like that? Fine performances by Samantha Morton and Toby Kebbell. Alexandra Maria Lara, in the part of Curtis' Belgian girlfriend, is almost as bad as English plumbing. Don't get me wrong. The skinny jeans and the trench and the bangs all look good on her. I just wish she would keep her mouth shut. And didn't smile so much. Half the time, it's the affected coquetry that ruins her performance. The rest of the time, it's her sheepish smile which she, obviously, has no way of controlling. It seems you rarely get good looks and good acting in the the same person. Yeah, I know, like that needed proving."

","why does great talent die young ? only 23 and had yet to live a full life. good movie, however it was depressing, and enlightening at the same time. it was a bit slow paced for my tastes. Overall, I was only familiar with one of their hit songs that was played relentlessly on the Radio here in Seattle. The problem I think during that Era is that everybody was overshadowed by Kurt Cobains, ""Nirvana"" . When Kurt hit the scene, music that resembled that genre, either pre or post Kurt were judged by his Benchmark, which in mainstream music is a tough one to compete against.<br/><br/>So in retrospect, I barely heard of the Joy Division music cause the Seattle scene has left a major mark on Music History and anyone else fell by the way side.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, though depressing and sad. Reminds me what real genuine talent will sacrifice for pure art. Something you won't find today. todays musicians are formulated pop teenybop no talent having moneymaker music whores. They all sound alike. something you can play in an elevator.<br/><br/>Ian Curtis, was the real deal. The Genuine Article. Real Talent.

","First of all, Joy Division is a dark band, wildly experimental post-punk that grabs the soul by the throat. It takes a Joy Division-esquire mind to fully appreciate ""Control,"" but that shouldn't detract from the film's acclaim. This is definitely a movie for the faithful Joy Division fans of the world, people who already know their brief discography and have taken time to think deeply about Ian Curtis' lyrics. The reviewer of the ""ordinary man"" review obviously has no personal love for the music, and no genuine concern for viewers who endure problems similar to Curtis'.<br/><br/>This film is every J.D. fan's dream come true, and the ""ordinary man"" review reveals more about the foolish reviewer than the movie's substance. The directing is flawless, and the intimacy between Anook and Ian is NOT meant to be beautiful, as Curtis states in the interview scene: ""Our music is not meant to be beautiful."" So, ignore that rubbish 6 out of 10 and prepare for a really intense film about one of history's most overlooked artists, the complicated (NON-normal) Ian Curtis.

The details of Ian Curtis' dark side are best left to the movie, but without spoiling, all I can say is I hope this film will win over new and future fans of what I believe to be the realest rock band that ever existed. <br/><br/>Going black-and-white is a big choice for a film being released in an era of CGI madness, when movies like Beowolf are topping the box office, but you get none of the played-out legendary thematics and sci-fi fairy tales with this film. This is a movie about the postmodern human condition, first and foremost.<br/><br/>Joy Division, unlike previously described, were not a punk band, but classified as Post-punk for several significant reasons. While the Sex Pistols thrashed and screamed and swore their way to fame, and while they are accredited with inspiring Joy Division and a number of other bands that eventually signed to Factory Records, they lacked something that Joy Division searched for in every one of their songs--a deeper meaning. The melodies of Joy Division's music evolved, and in only a few years, beyond even what most bands today are capable of producing. More importantly, the lyrics were never swept away by the distortion and echo-filled guitar and rhythms.To the contrary, they cut through the guitar's industrial opacity and reach deep within to the fragile mortality in all of us.<br/><br/>See this movie, spread the word, and learn how some things aren't meant to be beautiful."
"cpbadgeman","8","3","8","12 November 2007"," Bleak, unflinching portrait of a genius
","In the history of popular music, Ian Curtis stands like a colossus. The music he created in collaboration with the other members of Joy Division met with limited commercial success initially but over the years has been massively influential on generations of musicians.<br/><br/>Now we have ""Control"", a brutally honest account of Ian's life. Shot entirely in black-and-white, the film oozes a deep arctic chill which successfully evokes the inner desolation that Curtis appears to have felt for much of his tragically short existence. The film moves at a brisk pace from his adolescence in uber-drab Macclesfield (outside Manchester) when he idolized David Bowie and Lou Reed, through the formation and rise of Joy Division, up to his suicide in 1980 aged 23.<br/><br/>Newcomer Sam Riley pulls out all the stops in his portrayal of Curtis. He portrays him as in many ways a very ordinary young man blessed with an otherworldly talent, but also cursed by epilepsy and a savage depression that left him unable to express his love and need for those he cared about in any other way except through his music. However, the film is unafraid to portray him as being at times jealous, controlling, self-centered and dishonest- particularly in relation to the women in his life. In ""Control"", Curtis is human, vulnerable- he makes mistakes, he lies and hurts the people who care for him the most. The film makes it clear just how much pain he inflicts on others, particularly after his death. <br/><br/>But it is also shown that he carries immeasurable remorse and self-loathing for not being the person that he feels that he should be, and is also painfully aware of how much he can hurt the people he loves. His life is a battle- against epilepsy and the side effects of the medication he is given to control it, and also against an insanely deep existential hopelessness about himself.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are nearly all outstanding in their portrayals of people who clearly value Ian beyond words but simply don't know how to reach him, or don't hear in his music his expressions of how much pain he is really in. The scenes where he performs ""Dead Souls"" and ""Isolation"" are truly heartbreaking in their depictions of a deeply anguished man who is basically screaming for help through his art, but cannot express those same feelings directly even to the people he loves the most.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a deeply moving and truly honest depiction of one man's valiant struggle to cope with a life that overwhelms him. Obviously, there is a lot of Joy Division's music featured and it sounds simply stunning. Anton Corbijn's direction is restrained, low-key, and unobtrusive. He doesn't add any spin or tack-on morals onto Curtis' story but instead allows the audience to reach their own judgments.<br/><br/>Ian Curtis gave the world so much, he fought until the end to see something other than darkness- yet even now continues to fill the lives of so many others with a deeply beautiful light. This film is a fitting tribute to a very human genius.<br/><br/>Ian Curtis. 1956-1980. RIP"

Control offers nothing deeper than a Smash Hits-era recounting of Ian's dark journey.

","As an offering for the converted ,this is a fine piece of work, beautifully filmed by Director, and devotee Anton Corbijn. As a stand alone offering it is fatally flawed.Ian Curtis is not a great artist or singer.Joy Division were not a great band.They did not have a great song list, had one popular hit, and a minor repertoire of cult classics. Nor were they a great live band.As the years have progressed their ""legendary"" status has grown, but time has not been kind to them. The films ""raison d'etre"", therefore, starts shakily.<br/><br/>Despite these reservations the film did have a chance.Pop stars who die young always have a fascination for what ""might have been"",and Curtis's story does have the potential for an Everyman tale, but it does not succeed.New Order, the phoenix incarnation of Joy Division were far more successful artistically, critically and popular after Curtis's death.There has been little posthumous positive re evaluation of the Curtis period. It was raw, the ingredients were there for a successful band, and they subsequently made it big. And that is about it.So this is no ""Doors"" or ""Thin Lizzy"" tale.Instead, it is a bit boring and unremarkable.<br/><br/>Sam Riley provides a convincing performance as Curtis, the black and white photography is atmospheric and strangely lush, the contemporary soundtrack and Joy Division music authentic.Yet it is a soul less film. Written by his widow Deborah, we never really understand what is inspiring this tortured being. Sadly, suicidal individuals rarely bare their soul to the world, and I suspect that Deborah simply doesn't know. Inevitably her treatment of Ian's Mistress, Annik, is circumspect.Visually attractive (played by Alexandra Maria Lara)her characterisation is wafer thin, offering little insight into the attraction, or relationship.<br/><br/>Joy Division and Curtis mythology centre around the ""tortured young man"" image of the lead singer. This is faithfully represented. Yet young men in bands invariably enjoy themselves too, any ""joie de vivre"" is notably absent robbing the script of light and shade.In order to emotionally feel the lows, you need to have been lifted a bit as well. Here we start low, and get lower.<br/><br/>Corbijn is superb at capturing a verite sense of moment and time.Deborah Curtis offers a convincing sense of narrative.But ultimately the subject material is not strong enough to carry a 117 minute running time for the casual or uninformed observer.As an homage for the die hard fan it will no doubt be essential.For the rest, it proves to be inconsequential."

","Anybody who ever grooved on the music of Joy Division (and their later reincarnation,New Order)as I did back in the day (and still do)should drop what they have on & flock to whatever cinema is screening this gem. The story centers on Ian Curtis (played to perfection by Sam Riley)from the time of his rather unamazing adolescence (Curtis mostly hangs out in his bedroom,smoking & listening to David Bowie,Iggy Pop & others),until his untimely death at the age of 23. Despite being the lead singer in Joy Division, his life was pretty much the antithesis of the whole bohemian experience (he married way too early in life). Despite this,Curtis's rather humdrum life does make for a very good cinematic experience. The film,although shot on colour stock, was processed in a glowing black & white that looks stunning on screen. The music is to die for (all of Joy Division's music is actually played live by the supporting cast,all of which are musicians). I'm now hoping for film bios on some of the other bands that recorded for Factory,back in the late 70's & early to mid 80's (Happy Mondays,Duruti Column,etc.)"

","Perhaps I'm extremely biased because I'm a big fanatic of the British New Wave music founders – and Joy Division in particular – but ""Control"" is truly one of the best and most astounding biographies I ever beheld! This movie had me staring at the TV-screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open from the beginning till the very end of the closing credits. This film does not only describe the regrettably short life of Ian Curtis, singer and songwriter of the influential band called Joy Division, it completely also plays like his life: modest, depressing, anxious, sober, careful and saddening. ""Control"" is primarily a portrait of a struggling man instead of an aspiring band. The prompt and relatively fast rise of Joy Division is merely a footnote in the story of a talented young man who seemingly never had the ambition of becoming an international music star. Ian Curtis' life differs tremendously from all the other musicians in the world. He proposed to join a struggling band named Warsaw as a singer simply to help them out. He wrote songs about the things he saw happening around him (""She Lost Control"" is a beautiful example) and never even intended to quit his day job by his own initiative. Whereas all his fellow band members and young manager are trying to make the name Joy Division known and famous to the public, Ian Curtis married his teenage love and had a child. The increasing success of Joy Division is inversely proportional to the downwards spiral of Ian Curtis as an individual. His continuous anxiety causes the condition of epilepsy, he becomes dependent to heavy medication, loves two women at the same time and he can't bring himself to enjoy his newly obtained fatherhood. Ian Curtis committed suicide one day prior to the band's very first scheduled USA tour and without ever leaving behind a farewell note or a cry for help. His life story was a tragic one, and Anton Corbijn's film is a perplexing re-telling of the barely four years of vital events that brought this talented young man down. <br/><br/>Of course, Anton Corbijn very much knew what he was filming about. This native Dutch director started out as a music photographer in the 70's and developed into a music video director for acclaimed bands like R.E.M, Depeche Mode and Metallica. Apparently the band Joy Division fascinated him since the beginning and nearly 30 years after Ian Curtis' death, he finally realized his much ambitioned biography project with the help of the memoirs of Curtis' widow Deborah Curtis (depicted in the film by Samantha Morton). ""Control"" also largely relies on brilliant casting and dedicated performances. The actors do not only look a lot like the original Joy Division/New Order band members, they also actually learned to play the Joy Division songs themselves. And extremely well, I may add, as illustrated through clips of ""Transmission"", ""Digital"" and ""Dead Souls"". Sam Riley, a relatively unknown actor from West Yorkshire, truly gives a tour-de-force performance as Ian Curtis and too often it really felt as if I was watching archive footage of the real Joy Division singer. Anton Corbijn creates the exact right atmosphere through long sequences of silence, moody black and white photography and rudimentary set pieces. The soundtrack contains works from other music geniuses like David Bowie, Roxy Music and Iggy Pop. A must see movie."

","Being a Joy Division fan, I wasn't crazy about seeing a film about someone whose talent I'm a huge fan of committing suicide. I was intrigued, however, by the director Anton Corbijn who was the man responsible for many of the photographs that we've seen on the band on stage. This is his directorial debut, unless you count his music videos, and I'm always interested to see the films of first-time directors.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting the film to really tell me much about Ian Curtis or Joy Division, which is fine. All I really wanted was the film to tell a story. I didn't want to watch anything like WALK THE LINE, which, despite being a well made film, is just a plot less tribute piece that nobody can really enjoy unless they're a Johnny Cash fan. That was the main thing I was afraid of when sitting down to watch CONTROL. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in the least.<br/><br/>There isn't really much to say about the film in terms of what it's about. It pretty much details Ian Curtis's life and the rise of the Joy Division band from the perspective of Ian Curtis before depicting his complete disintegration and destruction all the way up to his suicide. To keep things interesting are the many people in his life which is what develops the plot.<br/><br/>Samantha Morton, in particular, is the main driving force in the life of the film as well as the voice of reason and she is the sole witness to all the pain and horror that constantly overshadows the film. His band members are also depicted much the same way, though without as much of the witnesses. They understand that he's in much pain but due to Ian Curtis's attitude they don't allow it to affect their lives as much which is what leads the band to a sort of semi-downfall, though they would later pick up and become New Order.<br/><br/>The thing is, the film is as much an art-film as it is a biopic. There is much attention granted to the visuals and the editing that gives the film a rather haunting and dreamlike quality, yet at the same time it lends the film a kind of gritty and uncommon sense of dread and sadness that makes the film feel a lot more personal and intimate than you would expect.<br/><br/>It's terrifying to watch at times knowing that it's based on a true story, but that was the aim of the film obviously. What struck me more about the film was how it didn't sugarcoat the cons of being part of that kind of lifestyle. I think because of this the film allows more humanity to shine, which is ultimately very much needed in this story. The film comes off truly beautifully because of this.<br/><br/>I think what a lot of people dislike about this film are the more artistic moments in which the film just lets things unfold naturally. There are a lot of really long takes and close-ups of many meditative moments. This doesn't make the film boring in the slightest because the tone of the film is so fascinating. The film is extremely slow-paced, but it helps to allow the viewer to digest the atmosphere of the time period so that you can really get into the story.<br/><br/>I think the other thing that a lot of people dislike about the film is the way that Ian Curtis and the band is depicted. It's not a very positive depiction, but I wouldn't call it negative either. Just, very human. I think people need to remember that this isn't a documentary, it's an artistic reinterpretation. It doesn't have to go by the facts because if it did there wouldn't be as much to appreciate in terms of human interaction. In addition, the film already is intimate enough.<br/><br/>This isn't a film for everyone. It's extremely depressing and gut-wrenching at times. It's a very bleak film and it really doesn't make you feel good about life. It's a very quiet and simple film and I understand that a lot of people want there to be a lot of depth with this kind of story when there really isn't any depth to it. Ian Curtis had some serious problems and when he couldn't take it anymore he committed suicide.<br/><br/>The film is unflinching and ultimately one of the most powerful biopics I've seen. So what if it doesn't have a good detailing of all the events of the time period like Michael Winterbottom's 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE? Even though I like 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE more than CONTROL, though I still love CONTROL. CONTROL is a powerful and very moving piece of film-making and I, for one, and very happy that I saw it."
"bobthegrinch","5","1","2","7 May 2008"," Meh, average
","Very disappointing. In attempting to cover Curtis' personal relationships, the story of the band and his epilepsy it ends up exploring none in any real depth. The first hour and 25 minutes cover a lot of time very briefly. We never actually see a relationship form, he meets people and 5 minutes later they're a couple or they're friends. Also the performances are average. Everyone looks the part until they speak, when they open their mouths it sounds like they've just read what they're saying, while Morton and Riley do capture who they're playing to some extent no one convinced me they were actually in it.<br/><br/>It picks up at about 1 hr 25 when they start to deliver the dialogue and emotion convincingly when Tony Kebell is having a rant as Rob Gretton. It's the first scene where I forgot I was watching a film and for the last half hour it's better. It also helps that the last half hour covers a few days rather than the years covered in the hour and half before.<br/><br/>The actors music performances aren't convincing, they sound like a tribute act with a good rhythm section. Riley only sounds like Curtis on the odd line. It certainly doesn't present the characters as the same people they are in the far superior book it's based on. Kebell (amazing in dead man's shoes) does better than most but Paddy Considine was better in 24 Hour Party People. Whoever played Peter Hook wasn't great and Bernard Sumner is presented as a wet blanket. In fact any scene with a counterpart in 24 Hour Party People is done better in that film. The death of Curtis ultimately has little emotional impact thanks to what has come before it. In fact the only really effective part of the ending is when the excellent Atmosphere is played. That one song is more touching and affecting than the 2 hour film (though Morton is also good in the final scenes). They should've focused more on his relationship using the band as a back drop. I really wanted to like this film as I love Joy Division, but for a decent account of this time, read the book."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","7 April 2008"," A little too controlled
","There's no doubt that a dead singer will do wonders for a band's reputation. Just take Joy Division. Yes, they produced some excellent music, but quite a bit of it was incredibly mediocre. But because their lead singer killed himself they've obtained a glamour and an allure that they never would have possessed had they continued to make music under that banner.<br/><br/>And part of the reason why Joy Division are so well regarded is because people can claim Ian Curtis as an example of the tortured artist. He's a man who suffered so much in life that death was the only answer. But that would be an incredibly shallow way of looking at things. Curtis was certainly a talented artist, but he wasn't peerless. And for all of people's romantic notions about Curtis, his suicide could have a rather simple explanation  maybe he had a negative reaction to the medication he took for his epilepsy.<br/><br/>And I think that would make his story more tragic. To have someone's life and career wasted because of something as banal as a chronic condition or a combination of pills is a lot sadder than someone taking their life because they were selfish and self-absorbed. Because that's what Curtis is. He's a man who marries his childhood sweetheart, who fronts a successful band and who later has an affair with an attractive Belgian artist. If he wanted to grab it, he could have everything. But instead he wallows in self-pity. He feels like his band is getting too big. He loves his wife but she stifles him. And he loves his girlfriend but she's too adoring. Therefore it's kind of hard to feel sorry for this man. But despite his cruelty, there's still a part of you that feels for him. Life is never as simple as 'you should be happy with what you've got' and people's feelings are often beyond their control. And with Curtis this is made worse when he has to suffer from seizures and the side-effects of his medication. He's a bastard, but deep down you feel there's a decent guy struggling to get out.<br/><br/>The end of the film suggests that it was Curtis' epilepsy that pushed him over the edge. We see him have a seizure and then he wakes up and kills himself, apparently unable to deal with his condition. But of course we'll never know what exactly happened that day. And we also never really know what Curtis is thinking. But this isn't a fault of the film. It's mainly to do with the man. For all his songs and all his writing, you get the feeling that nobody is ever really able to penetrate the surface.<br/><br/>But although you can't fault the film for not providing more answers, it can certainly be faulted for being too timid. The film doesn't tell us that Curtis briefly flirted with fascism, that he took his first overdose at 15, that he dictated to his wife what she could and couldn't wear and that he threw wine over her when she danced with another man at their engagement party. It's a watered down version of Ian Curtis.<br/><br/>The film can also be faulted for never really capturing the excitement of the band's performances. The film is beautifully shot, but the musical sequences never really take flight. And this can't be attributed to the actors, who do a great job. Instead it's a fault of the direction. It's too static.<br/><br/>But while the filming style doesn't benefit the musical sequences, it works for the rest of the film. It makes you feel like you're looking at images in a magazine. You're part of this world and part of this story, but you're removed from it too. It's real but it's unreal as well. After all, Macclesfield only looks this beautiful on film. And that's the way we want it. We don't really want reality to conflict with the images in our head  we want some part of the myth to remain; that our heroes come from a different world, a world we can see but that we can't really touch.<br/><br/>My favourite image in the film is the one at the end. We see smoke rising out of a chimney in a graveyard  Curtis is being cremated. He's being liberated from the life he felt he couldn't deal with. And although it maybe romanticises his death too much, it finally provides a level of emotion that was lacking elsewhere in the film. The man who existed in real life wasn't a particularly nice person, a man who sometimes treated his wife abysmally, but he was also a man occasionally capable of scaling heights of creativity. And it's that talent that you end up mourning more than the man.<br/><br/>However, although the subject matter would suggest that the film makes for grim viewing, it's also quite funny in places. In particular I like the scene where the Crispy Ambulance frontman has to replace Curtis and face the wrath of the crowd. And that reminds me of how much I like the band's manager, Rob Gretton. When he introduces himself to the band he plays it big. But then in the next scene we see him in his underwear, answering a payphone by saying, 'Rob's Records'. It's a nice way of showing how ramshackle the whole scene was. And of course you have Tony Wilson signing his contract with Joy Division in blood. But although all of this is great, it did remind me of how much better 24 Hour Party People is. Yes they're different stories, but Winterbottom's film, even in the brief amount of time Curtis gets in that movie, manages to scale higher levels of emotion and invention. I just think Control, as good as it is, is a little too conservative, something Curtis wasn't...even if he briefly was a Tory voter."
"chanandre","10","2","7","15 November 2007"," The Best Biopic Ever
","When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would just be your everyday, run-of-the-mill competent biopic. Hell, I was wrong. It all begins in the intro, when we see Control's credits flashing...it's amazing...And then we wait for the music (because all the biopic leave us longing for the music, the best ones, delay the entrance of the music and/or make that same entrance in a original manner, such as ""Last Days"", ""24 Hour Party People"", ""High Fidelity"", etc). The music comes by means of the records that, a very young Ian Curtis (very David Bowie- like), is listening to in his bedroom, the likes of Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Velvet Underground, etc. I adored the way the fans were depicted when listening to music, and adored all the reverence to the Manchester striving musical scene.<br/><br/>There are moments of absolute musical beauty (the use of sound is insanely perfect...), like when Ian is writing the lyrics of ""She's Lost Control"". It's history in the making. It's so strong. Other epic moments are the obvious moment when they perform their only-live track, ""love will tear us apart"" Another great moment is when we realize (very soon into the action, really) that the actors are not being dubbed but are really singing, so that makes the film so much real, and distances itself from a depiction and enters the territory of sheer realism and honesty. Another angle to it, is that Anton Corbijn worked with Joy Division himself, back in the day, so those inputs from reality, surely came in handy. This is the work of a superb artist, a genius photographer, and a newly found filmmaker. We have seen his work as a music photographer, and a video-clip conceiver, but this is an whole new ball game. Anton, you're the man! This is not a biopic. This a film about a human being who's hurt deeply by his draining medical condition, a man who strives to be good, and behave accordingly in his own emotional life (whilst occupying a neat job at a unemployment office), and all the same creating with his band, some of the most enigmatic songs of the past century. This a sure masterpiece and Mr Riley, is surely the new European heartthrob.<br/><br/>Hail Ian Curtis, the king ain't dead!"
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","28 May 2008"," Good but doesn't really get inside the focal point of the film in the way it needed to
","Ian Curtis works at an employment exchange in Manchester where he deals all day with the unemployed and perhaps unemployable. An off-beat and quite cold character, he does have a creative side and it is this that ultimately leads him to become the lead singer for a band called Warsaw. This happens at just the right time as local television presenter Tony Wilson starts promoting local music and a local promoter becomes the group's manager. Joy Division (as they are now called) are born, sign to Factory Records and start getting bigger locally and nationally. However Ian's challenges with depression and epilepsy become greater as he feels his life slipping out of control.<br/><br/>I came to this film with two conflicting things in mind. Firstly that Control had been praised by most reviewers but then, secondly, I don't know much about Joy Division as my age put this just on the wrong side of my interest in music and popular culture. So in some ways I was perhaps protected from some of the criticism of the film but then conversely I was not exposed to weaknesses in the material that I would not have known. When it came to watching the film itself I found myself perhaps shielded in this regard because I didn't feel the lack of parts of Curtis' life mainly because I was not informed enough to spot omissions. However there is no denying that there are omissions and that perhaps the film doesn't deliver that well even within the bounds that it sets itself.<br/><br/>For me everything I know about the period and the band has come from documentaries on Factory Records and from 24 Hour Party People so for me I didn't really want or need another film that covers the period, hence my interest in Control. So focusing on Curtis himself was a good move but it does then mean that the film needs to engage simply on a character that will be real to some viewers but not to others. For me I found enough of interest but never really felt like I had gotten to the heart of Curtis in regards his conflicting and contrasting character traits of needing but yet pushing away, depression, fan pressure and creativity. It does well at certain points but mostly we are on the outside, seeing Curtis as difficult without really getting past that. The music adds appeal to this approach while the character of Deborah adds passion and emotion that is surprisingly lacking in much of it.<br/><br/>The city of Manchester has been noted as being absent but again, having never been there, this wasn't an issue for me as it was for others. On the contrary I thought the locations were fine even if I didn't really get a sense of period (although all the right cars were sitting around the streets). The cinematography blesses it all with a crisp black and white look and Corbijn's direction was solid without being particularly flashy. Since Riley has already been praised there is no pressure on me to heap it on him as well. He is convincing (speaking as someone seeing his character as just that  a character) but I never got inside his head. Morton for me is better mainly because of how much of a lift she gives the film  her performance injects energy and gave me somewhere to put my emotional interest in the story. The supporting cast are good with turns from Kebbell, Parkinson, Naylor and others all solid and enjoyable.<br/><br/>So as a fresh pair of eyes Control is both strong and weak. Without any knowledge of Curtis beyond documentaries I was less protective or critical of a portrayal but yet I was left on the outside of his character  which is a problem considering he is the film. The events around Curtis, the period and the emotional core in Deborah help carry it, allowing the good aspects of the portrayal to come out but not to the point where the weaknesses were totally covered. A good film, but perhaps not as brilliant as the British media (understandably) hyped it to be."

","I have loved Samantha Morton since 'Leaving Liverpool', a great British mini series. She's upped the rating of whatever project she's worked ever since then. I enjoyed her rather small role in this,and unfortunately, it provided the film's only redeeming value.<br/><br/>Now as for the rest. Curtis's movements on stage while singing were embarrassingly ... what? Stupid, retarded, laughable? The music was awful, and though occasionally some of his writing came across anyway, it was that of an averagely intelligent juvenile, what you'd expect from a high school kid. Maybe with a future in which he honed his craft, his light could have shone. He removed the chance of us ever knowing.<br/><br/>He couldn't sing and the band's repetitive distorted insistent beat was perhaps the only reason an audience - necessarily stoned out of their minds at the time - might find it good. I'm not out of hand condemning this type of music, the Joy Division was just plain bad, but like punk-rock, death metal, and rap etc, it appeals to rebellious kids looking for something - ANYTHING - to cling to, and the more so-called truth in the lyrics consisted of distortions, filth, violence, and the degradation of women, then authority figures, then just plain hate.<br/><br/>Some rap I like. Some does bring across the writer's experience and opens a window into a world and attitude we might not otherwise be privy to. But is the sheer deluge of outright crap you have to wade through a good enough reason for trying to find the diamonds in the rough?<br/><br/>These forms of music seem to elevate the bad and mediocre efforts into a spotlight they could and should have never made it to. Ian Curtis comes across as being kind, but steeped in his own self indulgent importance, very little talent, and fans, as they seem to do consistently, elevate his contribution because of his committing suicide. He wasn't around long enough to fade into obscurity.<br/><br/>If I've offended any readers, then maybe it's time you took a reality pill and wise up to the fact that most of it encourages violence, degradation of the human psyche, and intimately damages our self-esteem for ourselves, and the devaluing of the lives of others. These things do nothing to improve the plight of the poor and lower class. They teach hate and ' tell it like it is'. Don't you think people already know 'how it is', and at the risk of affecting the bottom line of the mega-bucks record company incomes, it's time to help instead of hurt?<br/><br/>The movie was long and boring. The portrayals one dimensional. And the talent non-existent. What else do you need to know?"

So, my question is, what makes this story so freaking special? The changed environment? The ""extra element"" of epilepsy? This is the question I asked myself while watching this picture. And, given that absolutely nothing answers it, makes this movie very weak and trivial. It's old wine on new bottles - as it's called in Denmark. <br/><br/>I don't necessarily need action.

"bramblebark","4","0","1","12 August 2018"," Underwhelming...
","I started listening to Joy Division very recently and after liking a lot of their songs and doing a lot of reading about the band and Ian Curtis, I thought it would be a good idea to give this movie a watch, since the band had such a low life span and Ian Curtis was a very interesting character.<br/><br/>The movie described Ian Curtis as ""sad"", ""quiet"", and an ""outcast"", and I'm sure in real life he was, but in the movie Curtis just acts like a regular guy, it isn't really until he gets on stage and starts performing when Sam Riley starts to transform himself into Curtis with his strange dancing and awkward eye movements. I don't necessarily think this is Sam Riley's fault, maybe the director should take the blame for that, it would've been really nice to see him act more like an outsider that had a hard time fitting in with the rest of the band and society. Another glaring issue I had was that I felt absolutely no sympathy for Ian Curtis during this movie, he marries his brothers girlfriend, has a child with her, and then cheats on her, and then starts to get angry with her for wanting a divorce because he's having an affair. If anything I felt more sympathy for Debbie than Ian, she's constantly making tea for him and taking care of their child but Ian just acts like a total jackass and has a bunch of seizures. I don't know if this was on purpose? I don't remember hearing that Ian Curtis was a jerk in real life but maybe he was? This combined with him not really acting like a sad outcast at all just makes the movie feel kind of phony to me.<br/><br/>The length of the movie is perfect, I usually feel like a lot of movies I watch go on for a bit too long, but the length wasn't an issue at all for me-- What was an issue was how they structured the movie within the running time, they should've focused a lot more on how Ian Curtis joined the band, and them growing together, but there's barely any of that in the movie which is a shame because a lot of the time that's the most interesting part of a rock band.<br/><br/>The main things that I enjoyed were the visuals, there were a lot of great shots that mix in perfectly with the black and white, also I love the fact that the movie is in black and white since almost every image of the band and Ian Curtis that you can find is in black and white. A lot of the acting was great but like I said earlier I think the main issue might've been directing and writing. Another thing I enjoyed were the live performances, mainly since this is really the only time in the movie where I felt like Sam Riley was acting like Ian Curtis, and they definitely did a good job of mirroring the few live performances of Joy Division that are on video.<br/><br/>In conclusion I was a bit underwhelmed with the movie, if you're a fan of Joy Division you've probably already watched it, and if you're not a fan of Joy Division then there's not really any reason to watch it."

","Being a child of the Madchester music scene, viewing Control seemed almost essential. Never did 'get into' Joy Division, but New Order were my introduction to all things Madchester, so the legends & legacy of all things Joy Division/Ian Curtis/Factory Records always have some fascination for me.<br/><br/>Dead rock-stars instantly get Legendary status. Ian Curtis is one of them but I actually knew very little about him. Two hours of ""Control"" and you still don't really feel you know him particularly any better, except to say that he seemed incredibly self-centred & immature. Maybe we don't know him better because if the portrayal is accurate he was incredibly withdrawn and insular. He was obviously a 'tortured soul' but if the film is at all an accurate reflection then he doesn't really elicit much sympathy. Most of the torture is self-inflicted. The only thing in his defense was that he was incredibly young with some of the additional pressures of fame - so no surprise that he was a bit stupid & selfish. Real sympathy must go to his wife and fellow band mates. Though the credits reveal that the film is based on the memoirs of his widow so maybe a little jaundiced.<br/><br/>The film itself is over-long ... lots of long, arty scenes of Ian smoking! Lots of swearing which maybe accurate [... though reading a review by his daughter reveals that at least one of the characters never swears so profusely in real life!] but still grates. But the outstanding thing has got to be the performances of the band characters - seem to have got all the mannerisms & nuances down to a tee.

"Lejink","6","0","1","9 August 2012"," Joyless revision
","I'm not greatly into the whole Joy Division / New Order musical trip, finding the music too grim and never forgiving the Nazi-chic of their deliberately chosen band names. Plus I remember at the time reading in the music press of the day the legend ""Ian Curtis died for you"" and dismissing it as sheer hyperbole. After watching this movie, I still don't believe the latter but do have a better knowledge of the man behind the myth as well as a better appreciation of the band's music.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly shot in black and white by the celebrated monochromatic rock photographer Anton Corbijn (later associated with his iconic images of Depeche Mode and especially U2), the film is thus rendered bleak and grey, the proper background for the depressed Manchester and Macclesfield locations that were the backdrop to Curtis's life as well, of course as his turbulent life and the group's doomy, powerful music.<br/><br/>The movie eschews the traditional celebration of the rising success of the group to the extent you're hardly aware of their popularity at all. All the way through, Curtis lives in run- down houses and freely moves in everyday locations with hardly admission of his growing celebrity and increasing musical significance. Instead, the film concentrates on his epileptic illness and growing surliness together with his relationships with the two women with whom he had lasting, if difficult relationships, his wife Deborah and his lover, Belgian Embassy attache Annik.<br/><br/>I struggled somewhat with the relentlessly downbeat insight into Curtis's life and at times struggled to see how he could attract the attention of the two women who struggle for his attention. A largely absent and disinterested father and husband he cheats on his wife and yet returns to her, lacking the courage to do the honourable thing and move on to let her live her own life. In the end, his depression at his personal conflict, his debilitating illness, addled by his medication and drinking leads him to his final act of self-destruction and of course the debate as to whether this was a heroic or cowardly act.<br/><br/>If lacking life and drama (and humour) in the story-telling, there's no questioning the power of the band's music and the recreation of Curtis's hood-eyed, ""lost control"" whiplash dancing style by Sam Riley is spot on. The acting in support was solid, with an empathetic performance by Samantha Moore as the long-suffering wife and in particular, though relegated to the sidelines, the actors paying the individual Joy Division band members, who as well as looking the part, also convincingly recreate their emotive music.<br/><br/>Curtis's story is certainly one worth re-telling given his posthumous elevation to post-punk icon by the music press in the UK in particular. That said, the film didn't exactly move me and never seemed to really get under the skin of its subject, which given the prior knowledge of the inevitable conclusion, lends a slow-motion car-crash perspective to the story's progression.<br/><br/>No film about the artist's life here was ever going to be a joyous and uplifting experience, but Corbijn largely treats his subject with sympathy if little real insight. In the end Curtis remains an elusive subject , which may just have been the point of the film in the first place."

","As usual, my review is posted years after the actual film release. However, no less valid because of that.

Musically, it is genius. The fact that it is actually the actors singing and playing instead of Joy Division is very impressive. Sam Riley does a perfect job of portraying Ian Curtis on-stage. Having never met Ian Curtis off-stage, I have no idea if he was really as ineffectual in real life as he appears in this movie. He just didn't appear to have any real drive or passion. Perhaps we are supposed to think this is the depression that causes this? I can't say I came away from watching with any real insight into Ian Curtis, I still wouldn't be able to say what really made him tick. (Oh and a confession, I found Samantha Morton's portrayal of Deborah a total bore).<br/><br/>If you aren't a fan of Joy Division and don't know the story this film won't enlighten you. The other members of the band are reduced to extra's and you really don't have a clue who they are (unless you have prior knowledge).<br/><br/>This is really quite a flimsy movie, not much substance to it. I did enjoy it, it does not glamourise suicide as others have suggested. It is such a waste of life. This movie does not really explain why Ian Curtis committed suicide.

","I don't know if it's one of the best movie ever made but I gave it a 10 for the love of Joy Division.<br/><br/>I think the movie is so beautiful and depressing (almost everything that I found beautiful is depressing), the picture is really great ...<br/><br/>but most of all it's about the life of Ian Curtis and I almost cried when I saw Sam Riley moving his arms like Ian.<br/><br/>If you love Joy Division, how could you not love this movie ??? <br/><br/>What about you ? <br/><br/>Astronaut<br/><br/>__________________<br/><br/>Tyler Durden: Where'd you go, psycho boy?

","In a day and age full of bloated and nostalgic musical biopics Control is a welcome breath of fresh air that proves the genre is still capable of producing films that are both artistically and aesthetically inventive. Anton Corbijn's feature length debut takes an intimate look at the short life of the ill-fated Joy Division front man Ian Curtis. Based on the book Touching From A Distance written by Ian's widow Deborah Curtis, Control tells Ian's tale without falling into sentimentality but rather investigates it.<br/><br/>Control premiered at Cannes in 2007 to a warm reception by critics and overwhelming praise of then little-known actor Sam Riley, the film went onto be the winner of the festivals Director's Fortnight. Riley's portrayal of Ian is so hauntingly natural and close to Curtis as a person that it gives the feeling that you are watching a stylized documentary. Corbijn whose photography career got a boost after shooting the original Joy Division in the late 70's knows his subjects closely and attempts to examine their lives and choices rather than just solely empathize with them. Corbijn believed so much in this film that he even decided to put down half the cash himself in order to produce this multi-million dollar film.<br/><br/>Aside from Riley's outstanding performance another highlight of the film is cinematographer's Martin Ruhe stark and brooding photography of Macclesfield, England is understated yet powerful. His images are crystal clear yet dark, isolated yet full of life, youthful yet mature. The film's pacing is tight and doesn't fall into the conventional traps that usually bog most biopics down. Corbijn's debut is a poetic ode to a man whom shares fated parallels with Corbijn and has been a source of lifelong inspiration, complete with an unforgettable final metaphor as poignant as it is beautiful."

","Wow! Such noteworthy performances by all. This movie that was perfectly filmed in black and white made me feel several different emotions. Sadness for both Ian and his wife, anger at Ian for some choices he made, a need to pop a Prozac at the beginning, middle & end of the film :-), such utter feelings of hopelessness poured from the TV screen. When Ian sang, he put all his emotional and physical being into each song, it is no wonder of the outcome. I felt such sadness for Debbie...helplessness. I hope her and her child are doing well today. I think Ian needed to be committed for help with what really seemed to be a very serious mental illness. Hopefully, this movie will teach some up and coming musicians that being happy is more important than fame and fortune."
"DesbUK","5","0","1","17 March 2008"," Reminds me of 'This Sporting Life'
","The story of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is closer in style to 'This Sporting Life' than '24 Hour Party People'(one of my all-time favourite films). Anton Corbijn's film recalls that English socialist realist style of the early 1960s, with it's black and white cinematography and drab North of England setting. In Lindsay Anderson's film, Frank Machin escaped the dead end of a miner's life via Rugby League. Here, Curtis escapes the tedium of being an adviser at a Labour Exchnage in the 1970s via rock music. There's nothing in the film to suggest that Curtis - who committed suicide in 1980 - was a particular interesting character let alone an interesting subject for a feature film. In his film debut, Sam Riley has the impossible task of recreating Curtis. Often he seems vacant rather than enigmatic. Yet he's a handsome presence and does all his own singing, which adds to the feeling of authenticity. The film holds our attention when his wife Debbie is at the centre of the film. She's played by Samantha Morton, who goes from sweet teenage schoolgirl to sad-eyed wife with remarkable conviction. As an actress, Morton just gets better and better with each role."
"pivic","8","0","1","14 January 2008"," Ian Curtis: coward, poet, hero, lonely
","Ian Curtis was a coward, a poet, a hero and lonely. His legacy is Joy Division, a band he left by killing himself as the band was due to start their debut American tour. As the remnants of the band reformed as New Order, Curtis is personally mostly known through Deborah Curtis' - his wife - book, ""Touching From A Distance"". Through this film, Anton Corbijn has left his signature visual effects behind to reach further than before, thus allowing this film growth. Filmed in black-and-white, Manchester is portrayed as a gritty town where Thatcher's reign is firmly at hand, and the musical scene is emerging thanks to bands like the Sex Pistols and the Buzzcocks. Joy Division differed a lot. Curtis personal lyrics and deep voice stamped a deathly human touch upon the band's sound, and the film stamps the same upon his personal life, erasing the line between the two. This is a harrowing tale of a haunted individual who created some of the very best lyrics of the decade. The cinematography is brilliantly executed, the soundtrack is (of course) gleaming and the actors very good: not employing any stars was a good thing by Corbijn, I say. There is a tantamount number of scenes that stay engraved in my mind from this film, which can help resurrecting the kitchen sink-genre. See it. It is human."
