","I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised  I truly enjoyed it as much as I did.  The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either.  The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg.  Jennifer Aniston  had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever.  What made this movie for me was the music.  If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie.  Its all about being a rockstar.  Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to Stand up and Shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.<br/><br/>Jason"
"unbend_5440","6","48","56","7 September 2001"," Music really saves it
","As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock, I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better, I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band, and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.<br/><br/>But at about the halfway point, I was lost. The second half of this movie could've really used a lot of work on the script. I say that the second half of the script needed work, but what I should say is the second half of the movie actually could've used a script, period. The second half is held together by some predictable sequences, all telling the story of a guy indulging in the rock star life, which we've all heard and seen a thousand times. There were very few moments that actually were used to progress the story.<br/><br/>But I don't want to give the impression that Rock Star was no good. Although some of the movie didn't work, I still had a blast watching it. The music is what really holds it together. Both the original songs written for the film (Steel Dragon), and the background songs used. It's not often that you can hear bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Kiss, and Motley Crue used in a movie. And like I said before, the concert scenes are awesome.So for people who love great 80s Rock, this movie will be a lot of fun. <br/><br/>
Rock Star is an average movie, with an above average soundtrack. Not a perfect film, but it provides enough entertainment for your money."
"moonspinner55","7","34","41","15 August 2002"," Comic book cynicism
","Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous"". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****"
"Movie-12","7","32","40","12 September 2001"," We've seen this all before, but the film still captures an honest and insightful attitude. *** (out of four)
","ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>	""Rock Star"" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by ""Crazy/Beautiful"" director John Stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.<br/><br/>	""Rock Star,"" originally titled ""Metal God,"" stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris ""Izzy"" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group becomes irritated with Chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.<br/><br/>
	This devastates Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from TV's ""Friends""). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In an instant, Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.<br/><br/>
	A true story inspired the ""Rock Star"" concept. An Ohio supply salesman, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, really did replace Rob Halford, the lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high. <br/><br/>
I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like ""Fear,"" ""Boogie Nights"" ""Three Kings,"" and most recently Tim Burton's lacking remake ""Planet of the Apes."" I am starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. ""Rock Star"" is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg truly makes ""Rock Star"" rock. <br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care about these characters a great deal. <br/><br/>During the film concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed ""Holy Man"" and the live action version of ""101 Dalmatians"") creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. At the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. In ""Almost Famous,"" a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. Here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.<br/><br/>The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. The filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: ""now audience, the moral of the story is"" We understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual.<br/><br/>Fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. ""Rock Star"" is not a great movie-see ""Almost Famous"" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career."
"noahk","7","14","17","10 September 2001"," High Entertainment Value Compensates for Plot Problems
","I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed.  I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.<br/><br/>My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.<br/><br/>(2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS' Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC/DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again, not a big deal.<br/><br/>Oh, I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive that as well.<br/><br/>I could probably nitpick all day, but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart, if you remember them!).  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays ""Good Vibrations"" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment"
"joker-4","8","20","26","29 January 2002"," Simplistic and Enjoyable. Prepare to Rock Out!
","ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.<br/><br/>Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. His likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the Metal ""goat horn"" hand-sign several times over.<br/><br/>The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. More interaction with these life-long Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings. <br/><br/>Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score, the Steel Dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style Metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! Let's all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival."
"trudy.keenan","8","10","12","7 December 2001"," Be Careful What You Wish For
","Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him.  When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity.  However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change ....  This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it.  Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston.  It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk.  If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want."
"C00L_HAND_LUKE","7","17","23","13 January 2003"," No real surprises, but a solid presentation.
","Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects.  Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming.  Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less.  Definitely worth checking out.  If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go.  Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while."
"Shiva-11","Null","27","40","7 September 2001"," Rock N' Roll with a side order of excess
","Where have all the rock stars gone?  The bubble gum pop bands with their virginal image and the hip hopping wannabe baddies bore me.  Where's the flash and excess of groups like Led Zeppelin, or the old Motley Crue?  These were the hard rocking, and even harder partying bands who brought the sex and drugs to rock n' roll.  Whether trashing hotel rooms, engaging in debauchery that would make Caligula blush, or caught up in a deluge of chemicals and booze, there were no half measures.  Women wanted them and men wanted to be them.  Sometimes, life is good.<br/><br/>Life as a photocopier repairperson is less than riveting.  For Chris Cole the only way to cope with the daily tedium of toner and paper jams is in his alternate guise as the lead singer in a ""Steel Dragon"" tribute band.  Chris acts, dresses and sounds like his idol, hoping beyond all reason that one day he will join his idols.  Lucky for him, rock and roll is a fickle business. <br/><br/>As anyone who follows heavy metal (or reads previews) knows, ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the true story of salesman-turned-heavy-metal-frontman Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, who was tapped to fill in as lead singer for Judas Priest when Rob Halford left the band.  However, the similarities end there - when Judas Priest pressed for increased creative control over the project, the producers opted to distance themselves from the band and change the story and the exploits of  ""Steel Dragon"" are a composite of several apocryphal rock legends.  <br/><br/>With strong performances in such films as ""Three Kings"" and ""The Perfect Storm"" Mark Wahlberg has proven that he is more than a living underwear mannequin.     Wahlberg brings the same combination of innocence and wide-eyed wonderment to Chris that he displayed in ""Boogie Nights"" (without displaying much else).  These qualities keep Chris' transformation from nobody to rock god from becoming a ridiculous parody. Keeping him grounded is Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend/manager, the one person who realizes his talents and for once Aniston breaks free of Rachel, and delivers a decent performance.  The supporting cast, drawn from real rockers and solid character actors, gel well onscreen. Overall, the story is well paced, light-hearted, the soundtrack is great  (I felt my head moving back and forth more than once) and you actually buy the group as a real band.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and remember not to leave before the outtakes are finished."
"SunChilde","5","8","10","7 January 2006"," Great Idea....Badly Done
","This movie had the potential to be great. It started out with an interesting idea: small town guy worships famous band then gets the chance to perform for thousands as a member of the band he worships.<br/><br/>The problem is that the great idea was badly handled with an inept script. I enjoyed the music, but the story left a lot to be desired. Wahlberg did okay in his part, particularly in the concert scenes. But I felt that Jennifer Anniston was all wrong for this film. I totally did not believe that she would fall for a guy as goofy as Chris/Izzy. He reminded me of a big, dumb puppy.<br/><br/>Also, the emphasis on the ""rockin'"" parents and the scenes of the mom's home daycare center made the movie seem too cute and cuddly...cute and cuddly do not fit in a movie about metal music!<br/><br/>The use of real metal musicians as band members was interesting...but most of the musicians were bad actors. I know it won't happen, but it'd be great if another movie centering on the rock music world could be made...this time with a better script. An updating of the Barbra Streisand/Kris Kristofferson movie ""A Star is Born' remade as ""A Rock Star is Born"" would work nicely."
"longhair364","Null","3","3","25 June 2004"," This is based on a true story. (SPOILER, maybe?)
","That it is. It's based on The rise to fame of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, formerly of Judas Priest and current singer of Iced Earth. He was in a Priest cover band, among others. Priest's guitarist sister saw him perform live, liked what she saw, and set up an audition. Tim sang 1 verse before he was given the job. Be reminded that this was after Priest has been without a singer for 8 years! He held it for 6 years before Rob Halford came back. During that time he did multiple tours and 2 albums. He also did the vocals for Iced Earth's latest album, ""The Glorious Burden"". It was originally a favor, but eventually he joined the band. Another note: Judas Priest was originally involved with making the movie, but then backed out. And Owens never saw a dime for it either. Weird, huh?"

","*******Spoilers....*********<br/><br/>This movie looks like it was written by some Hollywood suit in his office who has tried to imagine what it would be like to be in the biggest metal band in the world in 1985. So the result is some stupid lame movie full of sex,drug & rock'n'roll cliche's. I mean its so bad that I'm sure that the whole thing must be a pi*s take.<br/><br/>
Some of the scenes are so ludicrous it made me laugh. The scene where Mark Wahlburg is arguing on stage with his guitarist at a gig... In reality the music is so loud that theres no way you could hear what anyones saying even right next to you. But in this scene the music seems to quiet down while they talk on stage. Hahaha ...<br/><br/>And when Whalburg takes so many drugs that he forgets what city he's in.. duh!! ..that happens without the drugs. But this is a Hollywood movie.. you have to have the ""singer gets messed up on drugs"" clich'e in there somewhere.<br/><br/>And then theres the ""singer sees the light ,leaves evil hard rock band and forms happy acoustic band"" clich'e. No Hollywood movie is complete without a nice moralistic ending like this.<br/><br/>If this movie is supposed to be loosely based on the Tim 'The Ripper' Owens story...how come Ripper Owens is still in Judas Priest and having a ball?? Sometimes reality doesn't quite cut it huh?.<br/><br/>
OK... Mark Whalburg is quite good ...considering he's been given a junk script to work with... But the acting looks forced from everyone else. It could have been a good movie if the guy had taken longer than 2 hours to write it.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought that it would be stupid and boring (and yes, at times, it was both), but there were enough quirks in it to make it really different and interesting.<br/><br/>First of all, I found it immensely amusing that Chris' parents were totally into his rock 'n' roll lifestyle and it was his brother who was the wet blanket instead.  Also, I liked how Jennifer Aniston, as his girlfriend, handled the situation.  Instead of being totally immature and jealous and breaking up with him in a screaming match with accusations flying everywhere, she calmly tells him that this is his time and his dream and although she is sad that she doesn't have a bigger part in it, she is content to go do something she wants to.<br/><br/>Also, I watched this movie on DVD and I would totally recommend this way to view it.  If you listen to the director commentary, he tells you that there are artists from Slaughter, Dokken, Third Eye Blind, and Verve Pipe among others that play the musicians (including Jason Bonham).  Therefore, these guys really contributed a lot of input as to whether the movie was realistic.  As for the guy who commented that there was no connection to Judas Priest, the director said that the studded vest, hat, and collar seen at the Steel Dragon house was a direct reference to Judas Priest.  Also, that the lead singer of Steel Dragon turned out to be gay.<br/><br/>So, if you like rock movies I would totally recommend this one!!"

","Being a metal head myself (though I like other music genres too)I'm not going to review the production qualities of this movie. No, I'm going to go higher and to speak my mind about the horrible facts who makes this to be one of the worst insults to whatever heavy metal have inspired in its more than 40 years of life.<br/><br/>1. The title. If the plot of the film consists in the story of a METAL fan singer, who sings in a METAL band who pays tribute to another METAL band called Steel Dragon, and one day he's giving the opportunity to front the latter band, why on earth have this movie been called ""Rock Star""?. Rock stars are Mick Jagger, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and they are not that metal (at all!). 2. The music. Is Bon Jovi metal?, no. Is INXS metal?, no. Enough said. 3. The lead actress. When you know beforehand, that the movie is going to portrait 80's metal life style, one with even a certain amount of knowledge about that era could foresee that the lead female actress is going to be someone named Doro Pesch (Warlock's singer) or even Lita Ford. Nop, here we have Rachel from that annoying TV sitcom. 4. Steel Dragon. If this movie is based (loosely) on Tim Owens'life, then Steel Dragon is the fictional equivalent of Judas Priest. Mmm, not likely. Though made up of great musicians (Zakk Wylder, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham)Steel Dragon's image and music is nowhere heavier or good as Priest's. I see them as a slighter heavy version of Motley Crue (when they played pop metal). 5. The main protagonist. Marky Mark it's an outsider here. I think Vanilla Ice could have done a better effort. It's like doing a film about the life of Bob Marley, and giving the main role to Adam Sandler (who would suck even if he decides to play himself in a movie about his life). 6. The end. If you think this movie is inconsistent, then don't watch the end. I'll tell you one word: Seattle. Can you make the associations?.<br/><br/>In the end, Rock Star is not good or bad. It's not entertaining or depressing. It's just a travesty to the Metal genre, the Metal community, its bands and fans alike."

I've only seen it recently and completely fell in love with it!<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very entertaining, provides you with a great load of rock tunes and not a single second of the movie do I find boring! It was a great idea that some of the real-life musicians were in this, doing what they do best. I was happy to see Zakk, as well as Blas Elias, they all delivered solid performances. I tend to agree with a lot of people saying that the first half of the movie was much better than the second one, specially in the terms of the script.That could have been worked on a bit better, but not a major biggie. One thing that did bother me a bit was Jennifer Aniston's performance. I thought she wasn't the right person for this role,I just couldn't see her as a rock star girlfriend.But as the movie goes on, you somehow realize that she did a good job with this.There is a certain amount of honesty and sincerity she delivers that just doesn't live you cold. <br/><br/>To summarize, a good and a funny movie, that doesn't go deep into characters but provides you with a good fun, a sense of nostalgia and of course the mighty vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Mike Matijevic!"

Back in the day, the industry churned this stuff out faster than McDonald's big macs. It required no commitment for commercial mastication. It was the same thing over and over again (a copy machine), album after album. It seemed the principal audience could never get enough. It was finally supplanted by irresistible force, but that's another story...<br/><br/>This narrative is simply a string of TV anecdotes ABOUT the lifestyle, ABOUT the bigger personalities in a weak cosmology, not that OF a cinematic experience. That would require some commitment, some leap of faith. This is simply everything we've seen in 'Behind the Music' -- pre-chewed and pre-digested.<br/><br/>Ignore this.

","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends  in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.  A dream came true? Well, almost. While starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.<br/><br/>
I liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. Acting is quite good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics I saw him lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. More problematic is the ending, which  is quite conventional, and may disappoint.  It looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. However, in an  ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! <br/><br/>8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film."

","What to say about a movie like Rock Star? A lot actually! This is the type of movie that is almost tailer made for the critics to slam. It is also a movie I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well....<br/><br/>I loved this movie-and would see it again and again-but I know that's purely based on my own personal tastes-Rock Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as I think that Rock Star has done. That is one of the film's strengths, the concert footage. You will feel like your right there with them and how could any hard rock fan not love that? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want a movie to just let yourself go and free flow into some great memories of good times past, then this is the movie for you. It is also the reason why I loved this movie so.<br/><br/>But it isn't a great movie. I understand that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, I'd probably have to be a bit hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the character development.<br/><br/>What is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. None. The movie has certain scenes-few and far between but they ARE there-that DO touch on greatness:WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 examples- 1)when Izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he takes)<br/><br/>2)The first ""after show"" party with Emily(Anniston and Izzy.)<br/><br/>3)Backtracking a little-In the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole ""business as usual"" tone sets the stage for what's to come. It's played very effectively.<br/><br/>But the problem is, nothing ever does come. There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. I don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly Anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the ""formula"" feel into true movie depth. Rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. And , though, those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.<br/><br/>Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING. WHY does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of believability. And, frankly the end was just corny. Made no sense and had no reality to it at all.<br/><br/>Watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. By the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out....<br/><br/>I hope I'm not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead I loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... Although many others loved it to, I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like I did or some who play. I'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a cliché. I think, one of the problems was the length. I myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.<br/><br/>So-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it WAS life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us."
"Helldorado13","1","7","12","17 October 2002"," Judas Priest story line with Bon Jovi soundtrack
","This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to front a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh."
"cliffo88","4","3","4","2 June 2008"," Disappointing in the end
","As a Heavy Metal fan I was keen to see this film, even though I had a few doubts going in. However those doubts were soon put to bed as the film progressed. The first half was very enjoyable for a fan of the music. A great sound track and the songs of Steel Dragon had a good 80s rock vibe about them.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film basically takes the story of what happened to Judas Priest in the early 90s: they're singer leaves and they hire a new singer who was previously in a Judas Priest tribute band. However come the second half of the film they really mess things up with the plot. We are somehow supposed to believe that Mark Walhberg's character is obsessed with Steel Dragon and actually singing for them is the ultimate dream come true but then when he actually achieves this dream he is just gonna walk out on it so he can be with his girlfriend who doesn't even support his dream and suddenly get over the band.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I just don't buy it. To me it basically said that Heavy Metal is just a phase that you'll one day grow out of. Well any true fan will tell you that this music stays with you for life. To me this movie was not written for fans of the genre because they totally copped out on the ending.<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised with Mark Walhberg. I still think he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood today, but I thought he handled the role very well. Also, as I said before, the soundtrack was also cool. It was also great to see Steel Dragon made up of actual musicians: Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black label Society), Jeff Pilson (Dokken)and Jason Bonham (son of late Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham).<br/><br/>A film of two halves so I'm gonna give 5/10 a wasted a potentially good film messed up by ridiculous plot holes."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm going to assume that both A) nobody is serious about wanting to REALLY see this movie, and B) nobody who saw it was expecting it to be another Citizen Kane, so, having said that...<br/><br/>It still was horrible.  Mark lays down an emotionless performance. Aniston is no more vibrant than her character on Friends, which isn't that different from the one in the movie, really.  The best actor in the film was the old British manager guy, who wasn't stellar.<br/><br/>The worst part of this movie, apart from having to hear way too much of the crappy music (nothing like fake old metal songs performed by some studio artist and lip-sinc-ed by Marky Mark) was that there was only script for the half of it.<br/><br/>Here we go - boy likes band, boy tries to be like band, boy loses his band, boy gets to be in his favorite band.  This much we knew... and after this point in the film - the little jokes leave, the vicarious excitement leaves, and the cliches take over.  The film loses any momentum it had, and people start going to the bathroom, getting more popcorn, talking to their dates, etc.  Boy parties too hard, boy loses girl, boy quits band.<br/><br/>
Gee, who saw it coming?<br/><br/>Had the film been a true biopic, with legal rights as such, it might have been better.  But the ""oh, no, we're definately not talking about Judas Priest"" act is a little lame.  It left me wondering what parts of the film were fact or fiction, if they even interviewed, etc.  And the effect was lost -- songs ""performed"" were (as far as I could tell) fake, not authentic rock songs, outfits were cheezy and lame (Dragons?  They came up with Dragons??  Who wears a dragon?), and the viewers couldn't get into the falseness of it.  It was as if they started making the movie using Judas Priest's name, songs, and look... then got sued, and had to whitewash it... leaving nothing much behind.  That was my take on it.  It just felt... awkward.<br/><br/>A more interesting story may have been the heartbreak and tribulations of the ""kicked-out-largely-for-coming-out"" lead singer.<br/><br/>But instead we get this tired old story that quits halfway through the picture."

After that, it all goes downhill.....quicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes. The scene involving the first gig with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of 'cine kitsch' I have seen in a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs.....will he get up and sing???......or will he stay there on the floor and not sing......who cares by now??

Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzy does.

Let's break it down. You take two really talentless actors, one who was a member of the funky bunch and one is one of the most annoying t.v. shows on the small screen, add in some really bad musicians from the 80's and you get what is this poor excuse for a movie. The premise was horrible and the acting was even worse. As if people had not suffered through the hard rock movement in the 80's enough, we have to endure it through third-rate story-telling on the big screen. All I will say is my condolenses on the people who got ripped off when they spent their hard-earned money to see this terrible movie with really bad acting.

","Ok so I was real excited to see this movie when I rented it.  I even had beer, and when I have beer its easy to enjoy just about everything. And I was really into the true life story of Ripper Owens, the kid who got to sing for Judas Priest, which this movie was partially based on.  I have a strong feeling in my psychic verberaorations Ripper's life is about 100 times more fun than this doo-doo.<br/><br/>Its sad because this is a great premise for a story, small time kid who plays in tribute band actually gets to sing for the band he has been emulating his whole life.  That's super.  Well Wahlberg plays the geekiness/metalness pretty well.  But get this, even though he has dedicated his LIFE to loving, imitating, and worshipping this band, he gets all goofed up over the fact that he can't write their songs now that he actually is in the band.  Suddenly he doesn't know that the guitarist and drummer always write the songs(That would seem like vital info to a true fan).  Suddenly this is a problem.  WHAT?  Suddenly lets just ditch our character for the convenience of a plot turner.<br/><br/>Wait I'm getting another vision, Jennifer Aniston in another movie! Basically we get the same ol Rachel character she plays on TV, but with metal hair.  ""Be be bebebebeebbebe"" whatever the hell she always does.  Its old and terrible.  Anyway she play's Wahlberg's girlfriend in the flick and is there to do little more than get happy when he does something good (YAaaaY!) and fret the rest of the time.  Oh boo hoo, we're getting into drugs, oh boo hoo all the other band members' wives are sluts and plus they hit on me and make me question my sexuality.  Yeah boo hoo.  This was only a DREAM of hers, and Marky Mark's, but now its just upsetting! Women should be more willing to make sacrifices for their men, THATs what I think.<br/><br/>But folks, this is the KICKER.  The movie is almost over, we hope, we think. Wahlberg's playing in the band and suddenly just DECIDES to take off, handing the mike to some punk KID in the first row and lets him finish the show.  The other members of the band just play on like yeah this is fine. That enables Marky to leave the stage, ON HIS OWN TERMS PEOPLE let it be known.  He turns to the stage manager and goes "" I gotta take a p***"" (which is actually supposed to reference something romantic from early on - Just think of ""Good Will Hunting""s line ""I had to go see about a girl"" but totally MeTaLized and you've got the idea).<br/><br/>THEN, OK THEN... We flash forward a year or two and Alternative rock is in!! Mark has his hair cut alterna-short and is wearing a cute little fuzzy hippy sweater and singing in a smoky coffeehouse.  Oh, thank GOD you got COOL!  Another character ditching!!  A true metalhead would never fall so far. LAME.  So here he is belting out this little soft sweet love tune while the other members (made up of the tribute band he was in at the beginning, they had a HUGE fallingout but yet here they are all together at the end, FRIENDS FOREVER XXXXOOOOXXXXXOOOO) back him up, also with cute little haircuts and pleasant, loving visages. Then Rachel comes in and he talks so SOFTLY to her its so sweet!!! CUE THE CREDITS BABY THAT WAS SUCH A GOLDEN ENDING.  Thanks a lot test audiences!!!<br/><br/>So I guess I didn't like it at all.

","As a metalhead, it makes me so happy to see movies about heavy metal and rock & roll. Metal does not get the amount of praise and respect it deserves. That's something I never understood. These are some of the most talented musicians in the world making music that takes the listener on journey. The best music genre is mixed into a glimpse of life on the road an finding your true self.<br/><br/>'Rock Star' is loosely based on the story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. Judas Priest's Rob Halford wanted to try a solo career and the rest of the band got Owens to fill in for him. Owens was in a Priest tribute band first, similar to Wahlberg's character. He did a couple of albums with them until Halford came back.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays talented singer Chris Cole. He worships Bobby Beers, the frontman of the world's top metal band, Steel Dragon (is that not a badass name or what?) During the daytime, Chris is an IT guy at an office building. By night he is the frontman of a Steel Dragon tribute band called ""Blood Pollution."" Chris takes every little detail of Dragon so seriously to be incorporated into Blood Pollution that they eventually kick him out. He doesn't know where Bobby Beers ends and he begins. Chris soon finds out that Bobby Beers gets booted out of the band and Chris gets the gig as Dragon's new frontman.<br/><br/>The beginning of this up until right after Chris' first performance with Steel Dragon is golden. Living life as a wannabe and fulfilling his dream was very relatable. And him becoming Dragon's new lead vocalist was nice as we could totally feel a starstruck Chris. But after Chris' first concert, the movie completely lazes out. When you're a rockstar (and in the world's biggest band), life is full of parties, sex, drugs, and travelling. We see Chris doing all of these and how it effects his longtime girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), but none of these things are done in a very clear and concise way. In the first chunk, we feel exactly what Chris feels. Then we get pulled out of Chris and become just speculators getting little peeks into Chris' time on the road. We can't relate to Chris wanting to find himself and wanting to change like we could in the first half. If the second half of the script was re-written so that it was stronger than the first half (movies need to keep building and move up), the whole movie would be as revered as 'Love & Mercy' and 'The Buddy Holly Story.'<br/><br/>Whatever. Since only part of the script is weak and the music is perfect, 'Rock Star' is a great time to have.<br/><br/>3/4"

It was interesting to note though that the movie was inspired from Judas Priest but what happened was even life imitated art in history of Journey that is why I was entertained with the movie.As a whole though,I felt that the movie just provided us a glimpse on the world of rock and roll bands as it fell into cliché after cliché of a typical romantic comedy that provides both humor and life lessons as the conclusion comes near.In short,there was really nothing original and refreshing about it expect probably the fact that we have story on a rock and roll setting."
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","12 March 2014"," The late 80s/early 90s metal scene
","2001's ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song ""Metal Gods""), which explains why the movie was originally to be called ""The Metal God"". All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.<br/><br/>In ""Rock Star"" the band is Steel Dragon (fictional of course), the singer of the tribute band is Chris 'Izzy' Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and the man he's replacing is Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng). Jennifer Aniston plays Izzy's girlfriend Emily and the Steel Dragon band members include Dominic West (who's excellent as always), Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson and Zakk Wylde. Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczyk also have prominent roles as Steel Dragon's road manager and public relations manager respectively.<br/><br/>The Ripper Owens story is an excellent tale for a film and this is a good movie, but the times are a bit off. In reality Rob Halford left Judas Priest in late 1991, corresponding to the advent of grunge, and Ripper Owens replaced him in early 1996; in the film the original singer leaves circa 1989 and the tribute band singer replaces him almost immediately. Ripper Owens didn't leave Judas Priest until 2003 whereas Izzy obviously leaves somewhere around late 1991/early 1992.<br/><br/>""Rock Star"" is just an enjoyable experience, especially if you're personally familiar with the 80s/early 90s' metal scene. The soundtrack includes numerous great songs from that era, as well as the 70s (like Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold""). Unfortunately there's not one cut by Judas Priest (!). Apparently Judas Priest were originally linked to the project but ultimately disassociated themselves due to failing to reach a financial agreement for the rights to the story; this is when the producers decided to ""re-imagine"" the tale, as they say. This is all well and good but shouldn't there be as least one Priest song in the soundtrack? Where's the justice? <br/><br/>The film takes the middle road between advocating the rock star lifestyle and decrying it. It shows both the glories and the pitfalls. When something's no longer fun and genuine it's simply time to move on -- to thine own self be true. Such experiences naturally have both positive and negative elements. Even if the experience ends up being more bad than good it's a necessary stepping stone to who you ultimately become, that is, who you are, your true success. A good example is Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. (check out their 2009 album BABYLON to get my drift).<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Some criticize the movie on the grounds that Chris (Izzy) turns to playing grunge in Seattle after leaving Steel Dragon, maintaining that he was a 'poser' all along. But didn't Rob Halford himself explore different styles of music when he left Judas Priest, in particular the band Two? In the film Chris accomplishes his dream and by the end has had his fill of the whole 'rock star' phenomenon with all its ridiculous trappings; he was older & wiser now and understandably wanted to write his OWN songs (as he wasn't allowed in Steel Dragon, neither was Ripper in real life) and opts to explore his art. Keep in mind that Ripper himself was a grunge fan and fronted a grunge tribute band called Seattle in the early 90s. When Chris leaves Steel Dragon grunge is the flavor of the month and he just goes with it; he's still young and he's exploring, that's it. I'm sure he'll go on to revisit his metal roots in the future just as Rob Halford ultimately did after his 90s' meanderings; the film just doesn't take us that far ahead. ***END SPOILER*** <br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""Rock Star"" may not be great but it's certainly an enjoyable film on the late 80s/early 90s music scene. It's equal parts dramatic, fun, funny, realistic, inspiring, educational and sobering.<br/><br/>GRADE: B (6.5/10) <br/><br/>INCIDENTAL NOTE: I was the guitarist/songwriter for a metal band in the early 90s and we opened up for Tim Owens' JP tribute band in Youngstown, OH in the winter of 1995. I knew the guitarist of his band and I got to meet Tim. A year later he was a friggin' member of Judas Priest(!)."

After a confrontation over the seriousness and intention of playing cover songs, Chris was thought to be misdirected and was eventually kicked out of his own band.

He auditions, he gets in and the rest is pretty simple.<br/><br/>I cringed at the end when he would eventually reunite with the girl that he thought got away. I didn't expect this film to go to that region of cheese that you often see in big production films that are distributed by Warner Bros. It almost seems like the writers of the film had no experience and did not conduct interviews to grasp the detail of what life as a rock star really was about. It kept inquisitive guys like myself to prefer to have seen real video clips and interviews from some of the top selling bands of the 80's without the stereotypical and scrape off the top story. It became formulated and predictable to say the least, but the film still has a spark of charm as it relives all of our rock star fantasies that we had when we were kids.<br/><br/>6/10."

All this is portrayed quite well and the actors are really good at what they do (except Anniston perhaps, whose character I thought was mostly quite unnecessary and pointless).<br/><br/>But the ending does not come together well at all. It's pretty unrealistic and very predictable. I expected it to be something really awesome as most of the movie was quite well thought out. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I think it would've been way better if he quit the band and joined/made a different hard rock/metal band where he could do whatever he wanted and avoid all the negative aspects of a rock star life and thus set a good example for future rock stars. Hey, look! I came up with a better ending already! Seriously, this movie could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the stupid ending.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a movie worth checking out if you like movies about the rock star business. Just don't expect too much and end up bitterly disappointed like I did"
"johnhenrik","5","1","1","17 February 2009"," What's up?
","OK movie, but come on. Where's the mirrors and the blades, the white nostrils? Without it, the band & their entourage would be passed out & sleeping on the floor a lot of the time, that is, when they aren't onstage, backstage, or talking with their managers, crew members, fans, etc. Also, the floor would often be in a bus, a van, a delivery truck, or in somebody else's motor home in a parking lot on the way to, or at the next stadium or theater or wherever the gig is. I think the hint that Steel Dragon's PR lady, ""Tania Asher"", is probably a tranny, is a funny part of the entertainment industry. It is not at all uncommon, at least on the west coast & in NYC. But, please Hollywood! You've got plenty of real tranny actor's, actress's, or whatever you want to call them ready for work everyday. I have known several of them, all XY transforming to XX. You can find them all over LA. They are bartenders, waitresses, ""T-women of the night"". Many of them are incredibly talented & some of those females, uh... males, are, hummm; you would never have known! I looked up that actress, Dagmara Dominczyk, & she really is a woman. If you wanted to touch the real world a little more, there were quite a few already established performers. Why couldn't you make offers to Jahna Steele, Vaniity, or an intersex actress like Eva Robin's? Eva & other ones you could have hired might need a dubbed over voice, but what's the biggie? You could have also looked for some tranny singers to add some spice to your ""Hair-Band"" theme. I'm not sure about when this movie was made, but now you could get people like Harisu. And, let me tell all you overly MACHO Heteros out there, Harisu could scare you. Was your pretty girlfriend born female? ""Rock Star"" showed a condensed version of the rock world of the 80's, but it was quite sanitized & Hollywoodized. The movie needed to show more of the real stress & extremism of that world, that insanity, that speckled reality. Oh yeah, I guess the REAL WORLD is not Hollywood."

","When I saw the add on TV. for ROCK STAR I went to the theater and re severed a seat for the opening night. I was ready for a movie that tells the story from the arena rock as to the band starting out in the basement dreaming of glory. (First of all I have to state that I sang in a tribute band for over 7 years and you really want to copy the band you are doing well maybe sometimes it overtakes you). The first part of the film is top notch. The live performances are great. From what I read the scenes on stage were shot between bands at a real concert(I can,t remember what bands they were).But what I really wanted to see was the business side of the story you never see him sign any contract, you never find out if he is made a partner in the group or is just payed a salary like a hired gun, and what did he have in finances in the end. The second half of the film is pretty predictable but the end really had me scratching my head. What singer would walk away from one one the biggest groups in the world? Just because they would not let him write songs for the group? I personally think the end would have been better if he would have died in the end (which is what I thought was going to happen (I guess to cliché). Or better the old singer comes back (IRON MAIDEN and JUDAS PRIEST fans anyone?)Let me just say for the most part I enjoyed the film but I was disappointed when the video release had no deleted scenes (I am sure there were some)"

","Mark Wahlberg has definitely proved himself over and over again as a star. But this time he's done what not many actors seem to be able to do: he took a character that had the potential to be overly dramatic and immature, and turned Chris 'Izzy' Cole into a character with so many different aspects of personality and depth that you end up thinking you knew him, or wishing you did at the least. Plus, the fact that he's basically topless throughout the entire film is something that will definitely catch the avid Mark fan's eye, if not for the storyline that appeals to everyone.

The rock stars life style unpredictably stylised, the love interest threaded through the heart of the film, the body surfing, the rock star language - its all there in bucket loads. Having said all that, this is a highly watchable film in no small amount due to the performances of Jennifer Anniston and Mark Wahlberg. Both these actors have a screen presence that holds your gaze.

"kwjen2004","Null","1","1","23 October 2004"," Movies could rock but don't
","I give this film a modest rating because around the time this film came out there was a bit of hype or revivalism surrounding eighties metal and ""metal"" and I feel that this movie could have been funny and hip but instead it's actually about the trials and tribulations of getting a job singing for Judas Preist. Doesn't anyone think this is funny? <br/><br/>You cant make a for-real drama out of a ridiculous hypothetical situation. When was the last time you looked in the paper: ""Journey requires loud pompous rock vocalist. Must have big hair and innofensive tattoos""<br/><br/>""Iron Maiden wants a cool guy to tune their guitars for them and make interview appointments. Must be good at doing metal leads.""<br/><br/>And so it could have been a version of Spinal Tap that was a biting and cool satire instead of a dreamy teenage movie.<br/><br/>While I'm at it, ""Almost Famous"" is dead serious as well. It's actually soft-focus melodrama instead of being remotely cool.

","Mark Whalberg plays Izzy the wannabe rock star who is the lead singer of his band. The band that seems to have a lot of skills, but no goals, besides to tribute Izzy's favorite band ""Steel Dragon"". He has amazing vocal talent, but for some unknown reason his only motivation as a musician is ""Steel Dragon"", and believes he isn't capable of doing his own material. A miracle graces Izzy's life as he takes over the lead vocalist in his ideal band ""Steel Dragon""...Izzy's girlfriend/ manager in this film (Jenifer Aniston) comes along to follow her boyfriend in the outrageous and scandalous life style of a rock star. Things were going smoothly for Izzy and this movie, as Izzy is living his dream rocking out with ""Steel Dragon"", with millions of fans now idolizing him ironically as he once idolized the same band a few short years earlier. The movie is now a little over an hour in running time, what will be the conflict for the remaining part of this film? Surprise surprise, Jenifer Aniston (Izzy's girlfriend)decides she isn't cut for her job as Izzy's manager no longer, which also indicates her thoughts on her and Izzy's future. I found the whole second part of this movie predictable and stale. Izzy's girlfriend quits and returns home. Izzy at that time was having the time of his life, his dream became reality, now with his girlfriends departure he decides the Rock and Roll life wasn't meant for him after all, so he returns to his girlfriend and blah blah blah!! I saw the second half of this film coming a mile away, its done so excessively in the average B- movies...Now I ask this question to anyone who reads this if you had your dream handed to you like Izzy did, would you run with it...Or throw it away for any selfish and jealous woman (and beautiful of course) like he did? Their are millions of fish in the sea...Izzy only had one shot at his dream, and he gave it up. Not smart.<br/><br/>All in all this movie DID show promise and I particularly enjoyed the first half. I can relate to Whalberg's character because I am too a man with a dream. I just wish the movie would have focused on the dream for once rather then ""boy meets girl"",""boy falls in love with girl"" ,or maybe Hollywood should start showing the world some realistic endings after all for every single marriage there is a divorce. If the film could have steered in the opposite direction in its second half then it would have been much more enjoyable. My opinion of the movie is almost like the movie itself. It shows hope and ambition to be a memorable film as Izzy shows to be the lead singer of ""Steel Dragon"", but in the end the movie sells out and becomes forgettable and ordinary, as Izzy retires from his dream to pursue the so called ""love of his life"". Stellar performance by Whalberg. 5.5/ 10"

Sure, there are issues with some of the background music being out of time, which can be annoying, but the awesome Steel Dragon tunes more than make up for that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it has a light, fun tone. The soundtrack rocks, and the original Steel Dragon songs are amazing! I frequently find myself singing them at random times. The writing is pretty good, there are several classic lines that crack me up every time. The casting is great, mixing perfectly suited actors and real musicians. This movie will definitely become a cult classic, and when that time rolls around, Jennifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg will be proud to have it listed on their resumes.

","Dammit.  This movie had SO much potential.  As a matter of fact, at first I couldn't understand the several negative reviews on here, as I watched the first 20 or so minutes--which were hilarious!--then had to take a break to do a few things, eat dinner, etc., and then went back to the movie...oh, plus another thing I did in the meantime was get online and check out the reviews, which I couldn't understand what the deal was.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg, of course, plays Chris, singer of a cover--er, that's right, ""TRIBUTE""--band that performs Steel Dragon tunes, a fictitious heavy metal group back in the 80s.  Even though a lot have dissed Wahlberg due to his acting, I was actually going to sing (pardon the pun) severe praise for him, since he spent a year and a half growing his hair long for the part, which in all actuality, he couldn't stand; he said during an interview once that it was like a ""bat flying in my face"".  He also looked like he was having the time of his life singing and banging his head along in his car and being onstage, which in fact he can't stand heavy metal in real life...now THAT'S acting, if you ask me!!  If you think his acting is poor, do YOU think you could go onstage in a movie and pretend to really get into playing some music you hate, like country or rap (if you don't like them, that is...I like some rap myself), especially with having to do several takes per scene? Right, I thought so.<br/><br/>I was also going to commend about how real this movie was, due to the fact that not all of us heavy metal people live in caves, don't get up until noon and stay up until 2 a. m. to play in some god-forsaken little club (after sacrificing a goat, of course)...no, Chris also works in an office too, and even sings in a church choir (probably a nod to Axl Rose of Guns 'n Roses when he sang in a church choir also, although that was when he was a little kid).  About the only gripe I had was that they overdid a few things, like Chris' headbanging parents; possible--after all, they survived the 60s--but a bit silly.<br/><br/>But then I settled down and watched the rest of it.  WAY too many songs. As it's been mentioned here repeatedly, another music movie, Almost Famous, is compared to this, which had the right amount of songs, not going on for too long or repeating them to death...and I'm not slamming those tunes since they weren't metal, as I like pretty much all kinds of music, including those, and they only went on for a minute or two before they switched to something else...here they (the filmmakers) obviously couldn't think of much to do with the script, so they just threw in the songs, skipping around the movie and all, just like when, during a ""break"", Chris brings in some demo tapes and drawings he made of what he thought would make it to the next Steel Dragon album, not knowing that one of the guitarist's and manager (I think it was) had already written all of the songs.  Tension is mounting, but they didn't really do anything to make it feel like it was building up over time: how long was this ""break"" anyway?  We have no idea, so that also tosses aside character development (or not).<br/><br/>* MINOR SPOILERS * This also leads to Chris changing musical direction, which wasn't believable, as we had no idea that he liked anything other than metal, so here it's a bit of a cop-out, to suddenly throw that in. However, it IS pretty funny what happens to the original singer of Steel Dragon (ha ha!) and all.  Chris also doesn't do drugs and the former Steel Dragon singer tells him that he doesn't do drugs either and that he's in bed by 11:30 every night, yet Chris immediately becomes trashed after his first Steel Dragon gig, and continues with that lifestyle...sorry, if you haven't done drugs after all this time, why would you suddenly just dive right into them?  Also unbelievable is having every tiny thing that happens to Steel Dragon winds up on the news...however, it's not identified what station is running these reports, as it could be MTV, which IS possible, I suppose.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was good to see not only Zakk Wilde's name as one of the producers (one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists), but then when I found out other famous metal musicians also played band members in this movie (Jeff Pilson from Dokken, even though I got tired of them a long time ago), that was even better.  It's also nice to go back to your beginnings, as it's been forever since I've listened to anything less heavy than death metal and grindcore, but I forgot how good some of the ""regular"" metal is too (i. e. where they have frontmen that actually SING, that is).  Jennifer Anniston is also good, but this didn't do well (well, besides it being so mixed) since it had a limited audience to begin with, since obviously the only people who will see this are those that are into hard rock and heavy metal only, a bit like how people will see Minority Report because it had a huge budget, Tom Cruise, and it was directed by Steven Spielburg, yet those same people aren't suddenly going to decide that sci-fi is cool and will turn around and see all of the Star Trek movies (just like how none of us metal people are going to decide to see pop star Mariah Carey's movie Glitter...barf!).<br/><br/>Oh well, it's best to see this in the video format, since if it doesn't work on you, then you can just turn it off and do something else, then get back to it later, rather than being trapped in a movie theatre for two hours and having to see the whole thing then.  At least they tried; there aren't a lot of heavy metal movies out there for us now, are there?"

"Sulaco72","Null","1","1","16 September 2001"," Airheads Without the Comedy
","WARNING!!! SPOILERS!!! As an unabashed 80's metalhead, I really, really wanted to like this movie. But I could not. Why not? Try two-dimensional characters, pre-fab plot, wooden acting, and a whole lotta lazy scriptwriting. You all know the story by now: Mark Wahlberg stars as a tribute band singer who eventually gets to tour with his idols, Steel ""everyone knows they're Priest"" Dragon. Their first mistake was basing this movie on a fictional band. I guess they didn't feel like paying Priest royalties. But that's a relatively minor complaint. What I found much worse was the movie's squandering of the great material it had to work with. Instead of celebrating 80's hair metal, the movie uses it as a backdrop for the most formulaic and boring of love stories...which is even more infuriating considering the lack of chemistry between Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Both deliver uninspired performances but they do have their moments (Wahlberg actually looks pretty good on stage. Aniston is at her best dissing the cerebrally challenged groupies she is forced to travel with.) But what little excitement the lead actors may have generated in this movie is killed by the fact that their characters are barely developed at all. The only actor that exhudes any humanity in this film is Timothy Spall (Beano from Still Crazy) as Steel Dragon's road manager. I read that the screenwriter had no prior knowledge of metal, and it shows. He treats the material with no love. It was cute to see Zakk Wylde and Jason Bonham on the big screen, but why weren't these guys hired as technical consultants as well? Then you wouldn't have scenes with Wahlberg during a show smashing up the amp of his lead guitarist for taking a solo in the wrong spot, talking about ""Don't ruin the gig, man!"" Uh, hello, you just killed his amp.... I was also annoyed (though this is a very music geekish complaint, I know) by the fact that in one scene the lead characters are shown listening to an AC/DC song from 1990...it's later revealed that this film takes place in 1985. Did the filmmakers really not count on their audience knowing 80's metal? It blew the continuity a bit for me. The filmmakers treated this movie as if a nostalgic soundtrack and references to Ratt and the Village People were enough to carry it. Wrong. (The Wedding Singer at least had a few yuks.) And given the subject matter, some of the soundtrack choices were downright baffling. INXS? Frankie Goes to Hollywood? Culture Club?!?? (Although the Talking Heads' ""Once In a Lifetime"" definitely hit the mark.) Even the original music was a disappointment. Blood Pollution was the only Steel Dragon song that was any good. And how about that ending? Mark Wahlberg just walks off the stage to ""find his own voice"" by becoming an anonymous grunge weenie in a Seattle coffeehouse. THAT'S your big happy ending? No thanks! Besides, grunge is the antithesis of metal, are we to believe that Wahlberg's character, who did nothing but eat, sleep and breathe metal for years really has an inner Kurt Cobain yearning to break free? Gimme a break. I really hope some other filmmaker revisits the land of 80's metal, because the material certainly deserves better treatment than this. This film should've been Almost Famous for 80's metalheads. Instead, it was Airheads without the comedy. My recommendation: Skip Rock Star. Instead, listen to some Judas Priest, AC/DC and Ozzy, followed by a viewing of Almost Famous."

","First off, I would like to say I expected this movie to be cheesy and lame. I was surprised at how well the drama and humor of the movie was played out.<br/><br/>
While I am not familiar with the history of the the band portrayed--purportedly Judas Priest--the events portrayed were not blatently far fetched.  Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job of portraying a devoted, but somewhat obsessed fan, of the Steel Dragons who becomes a member of the band.  The photo shoot scene was excellent.<br/><br/>The characters were likable and most showed development of the character over time.  A comedy relief character was added.  In the beginning he was humorous, but by the end he is best ignored.<br/><br/>Rating 4 out of 5 stars.  For me it is a single viewing movie.

","As some of those who wrote about this movie before me have hinted in their own words; this movie is bad. Mark and Janiston just aren´t good actors, they don´t even strike it as mediocre actors. They only thing that I found enjoyable about this movie was some of the music although I´m not all too keen on 80´s rock music. Oh and ofcourse seeing the son of late great john bonham on drums. On anoher note I find it a bit heartbreaking to read someone saying that it was a quite a surprise to see that Jason can play the drums adequately. I would think that the son of Bonzo could at least do that. If you want to see a movie about the excess of rock and roll then watch Cameron´s movie, it´s so much better."

","Perhaps it's because Bon Jovi's 'Living on a Prayer' is on the soundtrack that made me love this. Any movie that can pull that off has my vote. Normally not a Mark Wahlberg  - fan (if you will), I knew I had to see a film with this title. Mark does a fantastic job as Chris Cole - lead singer of the Steel Dragon tribute band. Being a singer/performer himself I guess made him believable being on stage. There is nothing worse than watching an actor play a singer and have their body and vocal movements out of sync with the music. The lead guitarist in the tribute band Blood Pollution isn't that convincing on the guitar but I suppose there is no need to get too picky. Excellent casting of Timothy Spall as the road manager. Just what you would expect of a road manager in the 80's.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie (and I guess the most unexpectant) is the relationship between Chris and Emily. Jennifer Aniston (brilliantly) plays the long time girlfriend and manager, Emily, with such depth and honesty - which is what makes the ending so moving. Combine all this with the great soundtrack and you have my reasons for my just buying this on DVD."

It's a good movie, despite all the niceness.  Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music.  In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good.  Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated.  She was a nice girl. <br/><br/>
Go see it.  If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it."

","I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.<br/><br/>Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend/manager.

","I first saw this film a good few years ago and wasn't sure I would like it. On seeing it I fell in love with the film and bought the DVD immediately. Call me sad but I've seen it lots and lots since then.
I acknowledge that the script isn't oscar material and that some scenes are predictable but if you like 80's rock then you will love this film.
It follows a young man called Chris (Wahlberg) who is obsessed with his favourite band Steeldragon and models himself on the lead singer Bobby Beers played by Jason Flemyng. He even sings in a tribute band dedicated to Steeldagon managed by his girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. As fate would have it a video of him singing finds its way to the guitarist of Dragon played by Dominic West, Dragon just happen to be looking for a replacement for their lead singer who has issues and they want to replace him.
Cue an interview and Wahlberg hits the big time but is it all he dreamed of?
The film is sprinkled with songs from Ac/Dc, Kiss, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Ted Nugent along with songs performed by the fictional Steel Dragon. The band members include Zac Wilde and Jason Bonham and the band's manager is played by the excellent Timothy Spall who puts in another great performance. Wahlberg and Aniston are also great and yes this film does contain some rock stereotypes but who cares.
It's full of great songs decent acting and the songs carry the film passed any gaps in the script. I love it, it's awesome."

","Rock Star (2001): Dir: Stephen Herek / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Dominic West, Jason Bonham, Timothy Olyphant: Rock mock documentary about how far we will go to become more than we are. It stars Mark Wahlberg who dreams of being just like the lead singer of Steel Dragon. After his band disowns him Mark Wahlberg is excited when Steel Dragon contacts him. The rest is a life of massive concerts, drunken orgies, and corruption by management. Directed by Stephen Herek who also made Mr. Holland's Opus, also about a music career but the difference is in position. Mr. Holland teaches music while Wahlberg performs it. Between the two Mr. Holland seems to have a better screenwriter telling his story. Wahlberg holds his own portraying a character who cannot identify with himself and seeks someone else's life. We know where this is headed but since Wahlberg had a real life music career, he seems fitting for the material. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is flat. She is basically there to bitch about him not being around and then pout and leave. Dominic West and Jason Bonham play fellow musicians with no personalities given. Other roles are drab stereotypes that accompany a screenplay so heavily burdened with clichés that it is difficult to focus on a message. Lots of loud music and energy burnt on absolutely nothing. On the positive side, Almost Famous is more compelling. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

Jennifer Aniston is pretty good. She isn't doing anything out of her comfort zone. There are some rocking music even if Marky Mark doesn't do the singing.

","Not being a massive fan of Mark Wahlberg, I really don't know why I watched this. However, I'm quite glad I did. There are some films that you just don't like for reasons you can't quite put your finger on. This is the opposite. I liked it and I don't really know why.<br/><br/>The plot follows Mark Wahlberg as the lead singer in an eighties tribute band to the (fictional) rock gods, Steel Dragon. However, his life takes an interesting turn when the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves (or is kicked out!) and his bandmates offer Mark the job as replacement. Now, if that sounds a little hard to believe, check out the movie trivia. Apparently, a similar situation actually happened during the seventies (and before I was born, hence I'm not totally up on it).<br/><br/>From there we see what his life is like 'living the dream' of drugs, rock and roll (and 'the other' obviously).<br/><br/>The thing is, based on that briefest of plot summaries, you can probably guess the highs and lows (and probably eventual outcome) of the film. And you'd be right. There are no major twists in the tale. Yet, for some reason, I still found it enjoyable to watch. There's a healthy dose of sentiment, but not too much to distract from the big eighties hairdos and thumping guitar chords.<br/><br/>Perhaps fans of rock (as I am) just automatically like it? Perhaps I just got lucky. I found it a kind of semi feel-good movie for adults.<br/><br/>It doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, but the characters have their own charm (and special kudos to Mark's on screen parents, who, despite being 'all grown up and respectable' like to headbang with the best of them down at the gigs and mosh pits!)."

","I had a whole morning to sleep on it, but I'm still not sure what to think of this. First off, it was very weird seeing Dominick West play a 'Judas Priest' guitarist, knowing him thus far only as 'McNulty' - I'll get over it. But somehow the credibility of all the characters ánd the story was practically nil, even if it was based on actual events. Well, 'based on', but the story is presented as a wide range of mostly clichéd and silly incidents built around a half-hearted (romantic) storyline - even if the premise is original, and a few scenes are reasonably impressive (such as the one where 'Izzy' does his first live performance and wins over the crowd), but mostly because of the simple facts, not the filmic value of it.<br/><br/>In all honesty, a lot of those clichés are to be expected in a film about '80s (hard)rock music, but this portrayal didn't convince me. The comedy side of it isn't witty enough (while it's desperately trying to be), and any dramatic impact is destroyed by the fragmentary approach that wants to get every rock'n'roll cliché in there. And then the look of it (settings, clothing, photography, etc.) was just dull and uninspired, except for maybe the vast set ups of the big gigs.<br/><br/>The music wasn't all that either, in my opinion, and I wish they hadn't put in any pop music at all, which just didn't belong there. The acting is just so so, of which Wahlberg's first part of his job (the young fanatic) was the most convincing. Well, I suppose this was one I just had to see (hardrock / Jennifer Aniston / 'based on a true story involving Judas Priest'). And by the way, did anyone else notice the Anvil reference in the end?

At times the movie seems to be disorienting and flat, but it could be deliberate by the director to give the sense of the ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" lifestyle (the highs and lows).<br/><br/>Several mini-stories exist within the movie that seem to be pulled from real life (such as blood transfusions for The Rolling Stones guitarist, Keith Richards).<br/><br/>There are groupies, drugs, televisions out windows and more.

","When singer Rob Halford announced that he would leave his band, Judas Priest"", many a Heavy Metal fan felt that the end of the world was nigh. After all, ""Judas Priest"" was one of the most influential Metal bands, having determined what Metal looks and sounds likes, even today. Halford claimed, after twenty years, the music (for him) had stagnated, that he wanted to find a new sound and that he was sick and tired of having to hide his homosexuality (which surprised very few fans, for whom Halfords sexual orientation has always been an unspoken secret). ""Judas Priest"" hired young, aspiring Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an impressive singer in his own rights and lifelong ""Priest""-fan.<br/><br/>When ""Rock Star"" arrived at the cinema, many ""Judas Priest"" fans where ecstatic: the movie was rumored to have been based on Tim Owens short-lived career as ""Priest""-singer.<br/><br/>Essentially the movie is about every music-lovers dream come true: what would happen if you'd become the singer of your favorite Rock band? Unfortunately, to the clear of mind and reason, the answer would be painfully obvious, even blatant: euphoria and disillusion would go hand in hand, many drug-fueled parties would be followed by many painful hangovers, tour-life would take it's toll on personal relationships, and in the end one question would raise it's ugly head: is it all worth it? The film ""Rock Star"" is as blatant, streamlined and obvious as reality.<br/><br/>As to the acting: Mark Wahlberg does a convincing job, despite actually having a Pop / Hip Hop background; Jennifer Aniston plays her role as boring and mediocre as we'd expect from her and Dominic Wests limited range stands in stark contrast to Wahlbergs performance.<br/><br/>It doesn't help much that part of ""Steel Dragon"" consists of real musicians (ex-Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham, the son of legendary ""Led Zeppelin""-drummer Jon Bonham). Most musicians (and their fans) come across as the most stereotypical Metalheads since ""Spinal Tap"".<br/><br/>Speaking of Metalheads: the Heavy Metal scene is extremely complex, with many sub-categories, ranging from Melodic Metal over NWoBHM, Crossover to Thrash-, Black- and Death Metal, etc. The average Metalhead would identify ""Steel Dragon"" as an arch-typical US-Hair-Metal band, sound and appearance owing more to bands like ""Ratt"" or ""Motley Crue"", rather than a ""True Metal""-band like ""Judas Priest"". Even the name ""Blood Pollution"" would be something adopted by a Death Metal or Grindcore band; but rather unlikely for a band depicted in the film. A little more research would have obviously benefited the picture.<br/><br/>Even though it's an enjoyable hour and a half but offers little-to-no fresh revelations or insights into scene, industry or even the musicians themselves. The film will essentially disappoint the average European Metal-fan – especially the fans of ""Judas Priest"". Hence, a mediocre 5 points from 10."

The movie starts out well and Mark Wahlberg does a reasonable job of playing an 80's metal front man but the story just isn't there. He sleeps with a few groupies, has a few beers, and sniffs some drugs but it's also contrived to give a cute little ending where he leaves the band after pulling a guy out of a concert audience who happens to be a better singer than him.

There's some great music, though some of it is very misplaced. Kiss, AC/DC and The Beach Boys? Surely some mistake.

Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, the front man for a band dedicated to covering his favorite band ""Steel Dragon"".  Cole repeatedly refers to his band as a ""tribute"" band, and spends all of his time matching the looks and sounds of Steel Dragon.  Eventually all of his work pays off, as the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the group, and they are suddenly in need of a new front man.  That is where Chris Cole comes in.  Renamed Izzy, Cole steps in as the new lead for the real Steel Dragon. The movie goes on, and Cole is forced to choose between making his own music or making Steel Dragon music. He's also faced with the decision to be with a woman who loves him (Jennifer Aniston), or having a new girl in his hotel every night.  In the end I don't need to tell you which choices he makes. While Rock Star is a fairly predictable movie, it is also very enjoyable.  There were moments that felt like Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"", but you are never drawn deep enough into these characters to achieve the excellence of that movie.  I also could have done without the nudity.  I suppose it served it's purpose, but it somehow seemed out of place in a movie with this much heart.  That being said, I laughed, and when the scene was set, I got a little emotional. Mark Wahlberg shows us all of the heart and feeling that he held back in ""Planet of the Apes"".  He is a subtle actor, but he is very effective in this, as we see his battle to become his own man. Jennifer Aniston has star quality written all over her.  If only she would let someone else choose the movies that she gets involved in.  This is the first movie I can remember her in, that didn't suck.  ""She's the One"" and ""Picture Perfect"" were not exactly star vehicles.  In this movie we see the gifts that she has.  She's like Julia Roberts in that when she starts to cry, you can't help but get welled up.  Guys, you know what I'm talking about!!!  She's beautiful, and you can't help but cheer for her to be treated right. Finally, I'm looking forward to picking up the soundtrack to this movie. For any youth of the 80's, there will be instant flashbacks to bands like Motley Crue, Poison and Warrant.  Oh, those were good days.  You haven't heard music until you've heard it from 5 guys with long hair and eyeliner. Steel Dragon had some strong tunes, I just wish that they had been a real band when I was growing up.  The final song done by Chris Cole is also fantastic and worth the price of admission. This was a really enjoyable movie, just don't expect to carry it with you like ""Almost Famous"".  Spend your $10, and enjoy."

","Once again Mark Walberg does what few actors I think out there do. He makes his performances so convincing. Going into this film I didn't really know what to expect. One side of me said this was branded from the start to be cheesy and garbage. The other side of me said give this film a chance, afterall it's about heavy metal music. I think people who are involved in music like play in bands will really relate to this film. From beginning to end, I felt like although the plot was kinda far fetched, it could STILL happen. Just like in Boogie Nights, you get caught up in Chris' world. From the 80's soundtrack, to the wack ass hairstyles. Everything that IS the 80's is on display. I think one of the highlights of the film is when Walberg is trying to ""perfect"" his British accent. Having real metal heads like Zakk Wilde in it was cool too. Kinda like the real porn stars sprinkled in Boogie Nights. The lead singer of Third Eye Blind (Steven Jenkins) plays quite a surprising role in the film also. I've never been a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she also does a killer job of acting as Walberg's girlfriend. Throughout the film you develop a bond with both Walberg and Aniston, which shows the film has great charactor developement. You really want good things to happen for them. The scene where Walberg is trying out for Steel Dragon, made me nervous. Like Walberg was my little brother trying out for the big band. Now, alot of critics and others will probably trash this film, but I think the target audience are the 20 somethings. Will teens like it? Not sure, they can't relate to the mid 80's, wasn't their time. Overall, I'd like to see this film get some type of award. It was the best movie I've seen all year, next to American Pie 2. The definate late summer sleeper. Rock Star is definately worth seeing again, and stick aroud to the ending credits. Their pretty funny. This is definately one awesome ass flick.

Mark Wahlberg, having been a pop star, does an admirable job imitating a tribute band singer who becomes the actual band's singer. Jennifer Aniston does her ""Friends"" character but isn't given much to do in the end. The major problem with the movie is not much happens and events just sort of happen. There's not a lot of major character development, dramatic high points or incredibly funny ""Spinal Tap"" moments either.

Despite a common theme ""Rock Star,"" I felt little for Wahlberg's character or any of the others.  The movie had few funny bits, but it never really developed the characters.  It was like an action movie that spent all its time on the special effects and forgot that there was actually a story to tell.  ""Who are these people?"" ""What have they gone through?""  This movie doesn't answer any of these questions.  I just can't recommend it."

That's because this movie is inundated with rock - and in a bad way. Hair metal died with the '80s - making a retro picture now? It's not surprising the film didn't even recoup half of its $38,000,000 budget in theaters.<br/><br/>I'm not picking on hair metal, but if you look at Motley Crue or KISS, at least they had attitude. The bands in this film are lame! I guess Mark thought this would be a good semi-sequel to ""Boogie Nights"" - he satirized the '70s porn industry, now why not '80s gratuity? - but, unfortunately, at the helm of director Stephen ""I Haven't Made a Good Movie in Years and Am Still Riding on the Coattails of 'Bill & Ted' and 'Mr. Holland's Opus'"" Herek, ""Rock Star"" looks like a laughable, silly picture.<br/><br/>Oh, and Jennifer Aniston's annoying performance as Mark's girlfriend only adds to the fun."

Mark Wahlberg wasn't that great. I thought he would turn out to be a good actor from what I saw in Boogie Nights. But, he hasn't done anything great since then. I felt he was miscast in this part.

Aniston is miscast. She's too polished for the girlfriend/manager role, but she's tolerable. Good supporting performances by Timothy Spall, Dominic West, Dagmara Dominczyk, Jason Flemyng, Tim Olyphant and Matthew Glave. The supporting performances are a strength of the movie, along with the music, which is very well done. I'm not a metal fan, but the movie has a handful of very catchy tunes. The concerts feel real enough.

The script is to blame. It's formulaic to the point of parody.<br/><br/>Many of the reviews have suggested that it is an accurate portrayal of the rock and roll life style. How do they know? Because they read Kerrang??? It told me nothing new. No insights.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film - I've seen worse. But it's not good either. As for the ""hold on to your dream"" clap-trap message?

"billcody","Null","1","2","2 February 2003"," what a waste
","From reading some of the other posts it is pretty obvious how badly this film failed on almost every level.<br/><br/>Most people think the movie takes place in the eighties - I guess that is because of the numerous hair band cliches and some of the music. But if that was true - how could Mark Walhberg's character end up in post grunge Seattle after one short tour? The true story that this cliche ridden film was based on was - as one poster already pointed out - was legendary metal band Judas Priest replacing their long time lead singer with a singer from a Judas Priest tribute band. What was really interesting about the story to most people was that at the time Judas Priest was often playing to smaller crowds than Rippers Owens' tribute band did back in Pittsburg - and how Owens and crew eventually won over long time fans. But why bother telling a little told story of a band overcoming the reluctance of their old fans when you can fall back on the old as dirt - Star Is Born based rise to stardom - and inevitable fall - brought down by sex drugs and rock and roll - nonsense that permeates this film. I mean that would take a little work and skill wouldn't it.<br/><br/>But back to the main question - just when is this flick supposed to take place? The 70's, the 80's the 90's? They have a Ted Nugent song being played in a disco right next to Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Seriously! The filmakers seem so out of touch with any time period it is hard to imagine they have even been to a rock concert in the last twenty years. The look of the film seems to be based almost completely on repeated viewings of Behind The Music. <br/><br/>But, hey that seems to be John Stockwell's specialty. Taking a subculture and writing such an unbelievable piece of tripe that any chance of making a good film about that scene will be instantly destroyed when his unsuccessful film bombs at the box office. (See last summer's Blue Crush.) Which begs the question - who's blank is he blanking anyway?<br/><br/>Having said that - Mark Wahlberg is actually quite good and it's a shame his performance was wasted in this drek. He sings the songs and actually has a great set of pipes."

Rock Star definitely falls into the latter group, buried under unknown-deals-with-fame clichés that are so timeworn you can almost see them unravel.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is the lead singer in a 'tribute' band in the mid-80s and Jennifer Aniston is his manager/girlfriend, and both give good performances. Wahlberg is especially good at lip-synching the vocals (provided by another heavy-metal singer, see Trivia).  Aniston is the one character I really gave a damn about; she is so much better in movies than she is in television. She has to get out of Friends.  <br/><br/>**Mild SPOILERS**<br/><br/>In fact, there really weren't any bad performances, and the production values looked pretty good to me.  The movie's script chokes on all of the clichés: band break-up, hard partying, fame going to the young man's head, girl leaves him because of his infidelity, disillusionment. etc.  Anyone could have written this script in about 20 minutes.  Most laughable to me was the constant reference to Seattle ... I just knew that he would wind up becoming a grunge act (most definitely a suburban version of Kurt Cobain, right down to the sweater!).  <br/><br/>Almost Famous covers the same backstage drama but the characters are so much less two-dimensional than in Rock Star, and it rises above the clichés.

Yes, the garage band (or porn house basement band, in this case) rocker gets his shot at the big time, then falls into the abyss of excess, i.e. the rock star life. But the way he left the band was unforeseen, despite the fore-shadowing of Mats' story of his marriage. And the film then illudes to bigger things for Chris Cole as he ends up in Seattle playing with shorter hair and wearing plaid. Perhaps he rides the wave that bridges 80's hair metal to 90's Seattle scene 'grunge' rock. At any rate, that Chris ends up with Emily makes a big difference in the reconciliation of his personal journey, as if there were another possibility (though Hollywood does occasionally try to throw a curve our way, once a decade or so). I liked this movie, and though he's yet to show real versatility, Wahlberg lends his innate likability to every role he assumes.

This is just a minor oversight, however, perfectionists will find fault in this.<br/><br/>Mark Walhberg gives a very convincing performance as a heavy metal singer. I was a little scared when I heard that he would be doing this film, however, he did the 80's metal scene justice. He really nailed the look and sound of the 80's right on. Also, the addition of Jeff Pilson (Dokken), Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne), Blas Elias (Slaughter), and several other rockers, adds to the reality of this film.<br/><br/>This film is truly one of the best of 2001.

Is this a film only aimed at tut tutting, middle aged, failed musos, turned film execs, who are trying to make a buck out of stupid metal heads who'll watch anything as long as a few distorted guitars and Jennifer Aniston are on show?<br/><br/>And do these film producers really believe that we the viewing public are as dumbed down as they are, or at least would like us all to be?<br/><br/>Who's going to see Rock Star. Judas Priest Fans? One or two at a stretch I'd say. Judas Priest, unless they're the big headed, manipulative, shallow b*****ds they're portrayed to be in this film, also wouldn't go. They'll no doubt send their lawyers but that's another story.<br/><br/>And what of Mark Wahlberg as Chris Cole, who's obviously meant to be Tim `Ripper' Owens. Owens was a devoted fan and a member of a Judas Priest tribute band who in 1997 replaced Rob Halford as Priest's lead singer.<br/><br/>Cole in Rock Star pulls the same trick but is Wahlberg the actor really interested in anything Wahlberg does? Two generations ago we might have called him an existentialist. Mark Wahlberg could have walked straight out of Catcher In The Rye if he could have cared. Remember Val Kilmer in The Doors? Now that man was involved. There was a real rock star. Wahlberg as a Metal Man, no way!<br/><br/>Still the orgy scene was pretty good fun and I am a sucker for stage fright. That scene where the new lead singer fronts that huge stadium crowd was a fine moment. But the bliss only lasted 60 Seconds.<br/><br/>One Wimpy Fly Out of Five"

","Finally ! A movie WORTH EVERY PENNY ! Definitely the Best Movie I've seen in a long time !!!<br/><br/>""Rock Star"" had it all, a solid story and extremely well casted actors. Watching the former hip hop rapper ""Marky Mark"" deliver one of the finest performances ever as a believable rock star was just a bonus. This movie is what you wish for in more movies. It had a good opening that created the basis for the rest of the movie, then the ending was just as good. I won't spoil it, but the ending of Rock Star won't leave you hanging as so many movies do nowadays. Don't you hate leaving the theatre after a movie p***ed off because the ending sucked and didn't give you closure ? Not here, Rock Star delivers !!! A++++++<br/><br/>Don't listen to the critics about this movie. The critics watch soooo many movies, part of their job, that they can no longer distinguish the good movies normal movie goers would like apart from the wierd potboilers they prefer. Critics seem to rant and rave about films that love to bore you, put you to sleep, make your butt hurt in your seat. At Film.com, Rock Star audiences gave it 92% thumbs up, only 8% thumbs down. The critics bashed it and continued to give their cudo's to films that don't interest the majority of the movie going public.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg should get an emmy for his performance as a ""Rock Star"" He was believable the entire time. But of course, they like to give those type of awards to an actor playing a handicap, or a vietnam vet. C'mon Hollywood, give this guy his cudo's !!! Music was also great !!! Bought the CD right after I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I've recommended this movie to a lot of people. That's how much I took to this movie. Can't wait to get the DVD and BLAST IT !!! Go see it, you'll love it !!! 5/5*****"

","If you don't appreciate this movie, you must not have been alive during the '80s. That was the time of great rock music, flashy clothes, & flashy musicians. The story is based off of the heavy metal group Judas Priest. A wannabe who idolizes his favorite rock band, gets the phone call of his life...to have the chance to be their new lead singer. You get so excited watching the movie, that one almost feels that they're in the movie. '80s rock stars Zakk Wylde (guitarist-Ozzy Osbourne), Jeff Pilson (bassists-Dokken), & Jason Bonham (drummer-Bonham) are in the fictional rock band, & what better way to have real live musicians. Also in the movie are Rachel Hunter & Heidi mark playing musicians girlfriends/wives...since both of them were at one time. The nostalgia takes you away, hoping that one day this music will come back to mainstream again. It's worth the $$...go see it!"

","So you wanna be a rock star? Who doesn't? Cool clothes, hot babes (or mansteaks depending upon your preference) and world travel. These days one barely needs talent...<br/><br/>The cast within Rocks Star both the musicians and the actors playing musicians just don't have any oomph. It's hard for me not to love Mark Wahlberg, though.<br/><br/>Marky Wahlberg is not only one of the cutest croissants in the bakery of man, but he's a wonderful actor. His soft-spoken, near bookish demeanor and hard crusty bits mix in a large portion of talent perfection cocktail. Sure, I'm smitten, but it's the truth. This is one of his most humorous roles yet.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston is still trying to break out of her Friend's mold. She hasn't done it here, unfortunately. Her role, as Chris (Izzy)'s girlfriend could have been played by just about any starlet wondering the lot. Maybe next time she'll get some meat and dumplings to sink her perfectly shaped teeth into? It's hard to get out of the whole must see TV stuff.<br/><br/>
Rock Star is a comedy, not a brilliant comedy, that follows the rise of Chris Cole. He's a lead singer for a cover/tribute band, Blood Pollution that drives the locals into frenzy while they emulate a real, famous, rock band Steel Dragon ; like all those tribute bands of the Grateful Dead or the Doors do even now at local dive venues to a screaming B class groupies yellin' over a quazi-karaoke night.<br/><br/>The year is 1985, big hair, tacky clothes and cucumber bulges rule, and so does metal. Chris is very much a part of the scene. He's a semi loser during the day, drives a beat up Dart, and lives at home- 'nough said?<br/><br/>
When Christopher's unceremoniously booted from the band he lives for he's thinking life's pretty much a big old bag of rag weed you paid a premium for. That is until his phone rings and fate steps up to his microphone. He's asked to step-in for the Steel Dragon's singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), ala the real life switch-a-roo Judas Priest pulled with leather boy, Rob Halford...<br/><br/>Chris has suddenly become the icon people in bands around the world look to be. Neat huh? But he wants more. Snore. Chris, now known as Izzy, does the whole Mick Jagger-Bowie-Poison gig and is livin the generic rock star life of legends...all while as his gal, who was always his strongest supporter, (sniff) Emily (Jennifer "" I see Brad Pitt naked -anytime I want"" Aniston) is starting to be lost in the fog machine of life.<br/><br/>He's rude, crude, whoring around and into drug food. She's gotta dump the creep. Oh, how quickly people forget who was there when they were beggin' for change to fill up their gas tank...He gets his ego bruised a little to though... hehehe (<-evil cackle)<br/><br/>Rock Star's problem? There's a lack of edge, no real energy of the ""time"" is present, and few belly laughs await you, dare I say it's a Spinal Tap lite? Granted Rock Star has some great scenes, some decent acting and lots of young hot bucks in tight clothing wriggling about a stage and scantly clad felines for all the audience to enjoy. Remember Mark ""the actor"" Wahlberg was once an underwear exposing hip-hop artist ricocheting around a stage in his Calvins, grabbing his crotch to sound of screaming girls simultaneously in prayer that his stylin' oversized jeans would plummet to the floor and reveal his winky. While Rock Star's music is other end of the jukebox different, Wahlberg's had the rock star experience and he does a great (I just think it could have been even better) job of bring Chris up to a quazi-believable star. Mark did provide less of a lypsyncing-local-talent-show impersonation and managed to capture an essence of what schmoo turned icon would be reacting like. The movie itself just didn't grab you.<br/><br/>The band Steel Dragons actually boasts real musicians with a bit of a name for themselves; the drummer is the real Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham -second only to Moon in talent), the bassist is Dokken's guitarist Jeff Pilson, and Third Eye Blind's lead singer, Stephan Jenkins plays a rival bands lead singer. So there's tasty treats for the diehard music folks sprinkled in the audience.<br/><br/>Often I thought of Spinal Tap, the quintessential rock star mock and wishes for Nigel (Christopher Guest) to pop up backstage arguing about finger sandwiches and the evils of bread crust...it never happened.<br/><br/>In the end , Rock Star is a big old metaphor for how important it is to be yourself. To find your own voice. Sure Chris/Izzy's made it big, filling the shoes of Steel Dragon's ex-singer. Somebody who already paved the road, so the fans aren't really gushing over Chris at all. That's gonna effect your psyche eventually huh? He's an artist after all...<br/><br/>Rock Star is also a chance for some rock and roll nostalgia. Not just for the fond memory of the ridiculously made-up boys of the eighties, but for those shapely men in their super tight custom leather performing a kind of bare chested ballet to screaming guitars and half hour long drum riffs. If your one of them rush and see this...if not wait for rental.<br/><br/>Snack recommendation: Beer and donuts, while reviewing Boogie Nights just one more time..."
"joeyramone78","Null","1","2","9 September 2001"," will probably play better on home video
","I got the feeling while I was watching ""Rock Star"" that this film was trying to do cinematically for the 80's hair metal craze what ""Boogie Nights"" did for the world of 70's porn. However, I would only call it coincidence that both films feature Mark Wahlberg in the lead. That is where the similarities stop though. While ""Boogie"" was a stylish, wickedly funny and often moving (not to mention realistic) look at it's subject, ""Rock Star"" is contrived, flat and largely unaffecting. Wahlberg does his part to redeem himself from his blank expression of a performance in ""Planet of the Apes"" here, playing a tribute band singer turned rock star with a very genuine feeling authenticity that allows you to sympathize with the charcter, even if he is-like EVERY other character in the movie-poorly written and underdeveloped. The former Marky Mark could look just as much in place working hardware in Wal-Mart as schmoozing at some Hollywood party, and that's a gift he's fortunate to have. The rest of the cast is pretty underwhelming; nobody's BAD by any means, but, like the direction, the cast is merely competent. Jennifer Aniston, cute and likable as always, ismore or less channeling her character from friends while the supporting players left no impression at all. Another problem with the film is that it cannot make up it's mind-one minute it's a cute, smirky running joke/homage to an era gone by (a la ""Wedding Singer""), the next minute a ""shocking behind the scenes look"" at a world of debauchery and betrayal before finally settling as a ho-hum melodrama. While Wahlberg seems as if he knew exactly what he was doing with the character, the never quite finds it's own tone or rhythm, leaving the viewer with a film that's not wholly unpleasant, just unmemorable."
"mm-39","7","1","2","8 September 2001"," Realistic
","Spoiler!!!!  I found this movie realistic.  I know the critics will hate this.  When I was a teenager, the media and boomers hated heavy metal; it did not reflect the Beatles culture of the past.  In fact it destroyed it, like what Rap did to metal.  I grew up in the 80's and wondered what it would of been like to live that Rock Star dream, of over excess.  This film is great as a almost documentary on the life.  This film shows how much fun fame, excess, and the continual high is, but shows the realities of excess, like too much water for a plant one starts to rot, and burns out.  It would be fun to rock on 15 000 fans, and live with the adulation of millions, but it has a cost.  The cost of excess on personal relationships, on one's values, what one is really expected to do in order to fit it.  The pecking order of the band, and what the members really want.  The lead character finds out the old lead singer is gay, and lived a quiet life, not this heterosexual full steam, party and die image.  In the end, the Roadie told of his chance at normality, and how he gave up a wife and kids for these demands.  Chris(Izzy) chose to live normality, instead of being with some stripper who wanted her turn on the ride before she had to go to work.  As in all scenes, we see that the fad of metal die and a more wimpy grunge era begin.  Instead of fading away with it, he choose to be with the one he loves."

","If you have not seen Rock Star and you are considering seeing it, maybe you should, because you know the inside of a cinema can be really interesting to look at, because what's on the screen is so uneventful and boring you'll find yourself wondering if the curtains near the screen are black or a very dark red. Its not worth wasting any more time typing about this movie because I've already lost over an hour and a half of my life thinking how I should really be getting out more instead of fascinating about the roof collapsing taking this horribly awful movie with it."

","""The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year."" Guess what???? The names have been changed but the story ACTUALLY HAPPENED!!!!! The band was Judas Priest, their lead singer was gay (their heavy metal ""look"" of leather and studs was robbed from the gay community where it was popularly worn all the time). His name is Rob Halford.<br/><br/>After immense success as one of the top heavy metal bands of the 80's, Halford took off and he was replaced by this young ""kid"" who played in a Judas Priest cover band. Just like the lead singer in the movie, Rob Halford was known for having a very high vocal range which this kid could deal with.<br/><br/>I don't know for how long it lasted but it fizzled out rather quickly. I don't think they ever made an album together. BTW, the guitarist in the movie is Zakk Wylde who played in Ozzy's band, the bassist is Jeff Pilson the bassist for Dokken and I believe the drummer was Bonhem."

We all die young is an incredible song, as is Colorful, and Wahlberg's incredible voice more than makes up for a slight lack of complexity in the plot. Having said this, i don't see that as a negative point, as it is a great story.<br/><br/>Music aside, the message of the film makes me chuckle each time i see it - that however much you can devote your life to something, and want to be something you're not, a lot of the time you're wrong, and what you really want is what you already had. I've seen this film again and again, and I think that the beauty of the film is that each time I pick up on new jokes which have subtly been woven into the background.<br/><br/>Simply put, the film inspires me."

","Have just finished watching this on video, and looked at various comments. It wasn't bad; it wasn't all that good. There were some nice moments - Timothy Spall good, as always, and I liked the bit when the original lead singer Bobby not only admitted he was gay but took off his wig. I think it showed the difference between leading a tribute band and getting to have a fairly ordinary life otherwise, with a loving girlfriend, and living the rock star life for real, constantly on the move, can't go out and just hang around because you'll be mobbed, your girlfriend bored out of her skull because there's nothing for her to do except what she doesn't want to do (be a vacuous stoned rock chick), women constantly hitting on you just to score with a rock star. And in this case, when finally you start wanting to do your own thing, you can't, you have to sing what other people write, just go on doing the same old thing. So Chris Cole grows up a bit and decides what he *really* wants. Okay, so it's a cliché, and I agreed with a reviewer who said he wanted more characterisation, especially on Chris and Emily and their backstory. But it was quite well acted, I thought; good chemistry between Wahlberg and Aniston (let's be honest, she's the reason I watched the film). In many ways, the first part of the film was the best. So, 5/10."

","Not bad, not great, not anything much, but it gets better as it progresses, and it ends up being more than the lump of bland nothingness that ""Almost Famous"" is. Herek makes only one real mistake...<br/><br/>I call it The Fallacy of the Like-Minded Soundtrack. This is the story of a musician from the 1980s: the ""Steel Dragon"" songs he slavishly reproduces, strangled high note for strangled high note, and the songs of his own (well, one of them) which he ends up singing instead. So we hear a decent amount of 80s-style rock. But what of the moments when nobody is singing? What should the soundtrack consist of then? Why ... more 80s-style rock, right?<br/><br/>Wrong. The actual songs, the songs that are being presented to us, come across as just another part of the musical wallpaper (which, for the first part of the movie, is just too darned relentlessly loud). You can't really HEAR when the songs that aren't part of the story end and the songs that are begin. And rock songs make poor soundtrack material even in the best of circumstances. While I'm aware that a traditional orchestral score might clash with the subject matter, and synthesised minimalist drivel is too bad in itself to be worth considering, there IS at least one other option: silence."

"michaelRokeefe","7","1","3","13 August 2002"," Live the fantasy that others only dream about.
","This movie is a lot better than you imagine. Chris Cole is the lead singer of a tribute band that is swept off his feet when he is asked to join the real group and then drowns in the world of sex, drugs and heavy metal. Mark Wahlberg plays the part of Cole and eases into the role excellently probably due to his own musical background. Jennifer Aniston plays Emily, Cole's love interest and manager. She can only stand so much of watching Cole sink lower and deeper into the decadent world associated with the band. Emily leaves to start a new life in Seattle and later Cole comes to his senses when he realizes that the Steel Dragon does not want his input more than his sexually willing body and voice to sustain the group. Cole hands over the mic to an eager wannabe and trades in his heavy metal wardrobe for jeans and sweaters and singing his own songs in front of half-filled coffee houses in Seattle.<br/><br/>Like I said, Wahlberg is excellent in the role. I've never been an Aniston fan, but she really is impressive in this movie. Timothy Spall is moderately funny in the role as the Steel Dragon's road manager. Lending their individual talents to make the film more believable are: Jason Bonham, Timothy Olyphant, Brian Van Ark, Jeff Pilson, Jason Flemyng and Dominic West.<br/><br/>Besides the music of Steel Dragon and their tribute band Blood Pollution there is original music from the likes of Kiss, Ted Nugent, Bon Jovi, Everclear and Motley Crue. <br/><br/>Note: This story is reportedly roughly based on the story of Judas Priest's Tim ""Ripper"" Owens."

","So what happens when a person's dreams actually DO come true, especially when the context of that dream turns out to be superstardom in the celebrity driven culture of modern America?  Does that individual, in attaining the summit of fame and fortune, find true happiness and fulfillment there or does he come to realize that it is all mere ashes in the long run?<br/><br/>These questions have formed the basis for any number of films in the past and `Rock Star' doesn't bring much new insight to the theme.  However, in style and spirit, this film by director Stephen Herek is just loopy enough to be entertaining.  Although writer John Stockwell provides a basically superficial - and in some ways even sanitized - survey of the rock star culture, at least we are spared some of the heavy-handed rebel angst that usually accompanies films on this subject.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the film incorporates elements that go against the grain of the subject matter.  For instance, the main character, Chris Cole, is less a wannabe rock star than an obsessed devotee of his favorite rock band known as Steel Dragon.  Chris emulates the band's adored lead singer to such an extent that the people around him - including his own band members who spend most of their time covering Steel Dragon's tunes - begin to feel that Chris might actually be having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, that he may actually be coming to think that he IS his idol.  The screenplay also breaks out of the mold by having Chris's parents be supportive of his endeavors and by making Chris himself a rocker without a societal chip on his shoulder.  Chris simply loves rock music and the band that he feels has come to epitomize it for him.  Unlike in most of these stories, the lead character is not an ambitious, driven, trailblazing artist but rather a follower content to bask in another person's glory.<br/><br/>Until fate one day intervenes in an astonishing way and Chris gets that rare chance to live out his ultimate life fantasy.  He receives a call from the leader of Steel Dragon who has heard Chris's renditions of their songs and offers him a job as replacement for the burnt out lead singer, Chris' idol. At this point the film lapses into more familiar territory, with Chris and his girlfriend taking the inevitable downward spiral from wide-eyed innocence to the hedonistic trap of unbridled sex, drugs, booze etc. - and all the interpersonal strain this places on once-solid relationships. Happily, `Rock Star,' although it shows all these conventional aspects, doesn't go overboard into total despair and misery as so many previous films on this topic have.  In fact, it is surprising just how upbeat the film remains even in its darkest moments.  Even though that adds to the superficial quality of the film, it also keeps it from becoming fashionably cynical and clichéd.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gives an energetic performance as Chris and Jennifer Aniston conveys a real transcendent sweetness as Emily, Chris' devoted girlfriend. One ends up not believing a minute of `Rock Star' (at least not after that fateful phone call arrives), but it has a nice fairytale quality nonetheless."

Having missed the '80's in music due to having a life, I did try to figure out if the fictional band was just a hair band, a hard rock band, a light metal band, thrash metal or what, as it's based on Judas Priest which is more metal and alienated than this.<br/><br/>But with all those caveats, I was surprised how enjoyable the movie was, and with a fun authentic-sounding soundtrack with folks like Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde in the fictional band (well, to me as a non-expert in whatever light metal rock genre it is with AC/DC, Bon Jovi, etc.).<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is simply charming through all the hair extensions, much more like his earnest eager to please ""Boogie Nights"" character than his would-be hero in ""Planet of the Apes."" Jennifer Aniston's character is surprisingly more intelligent and secure than her ""Friends"" persona.<br/><br/>The groupies here are much less benign than the Muses of ""Almost Famous,"" but then this is a decade later in the travails of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. I don't think I've heard this line from a professional stripper in a VH-1 music movie: ""Hey I need to do you now cause I have to get to my job by midnight.""<br/><br/>The production values are very high.

This is amazing that it includes not only every rock cliche in the book (even TV set out of window is shown - TV-out-of-window for christ sake! TV-out-of-window is not even allowed in satire!), but every cliche involved in a rock musical film. If you have never seen any before and want to catch up on forty years of cinema buy your ticket now. This is just a compilation tape.

Nothing. Boy dreams of fame - get fame - finds that fame is not what he thinks it is. No wait, wait. Boy becomes corrupted by fame? No, no, wait again. How about Boy gets fame as a rock star and is screamed at by thousands of girls, but all the time he secretly wants to play soft acoustic rock in an old pullover in a coffee bar? Marky Mark in a pully - no that was an out take that got put in by mistake surely!<br/><br/>So how is the telling of the motley cliches? Well professional, but not that great. Aniston is not an actress, just a personality actress that got very very lucky. Here she wears a thong under a kind of knit dress and kisses a girl (I think anyway - who can tell in Heavy Metal), which I suppose is as wild as she gets. Maybe she will realise that Marky Marky has changed and no longer needs her ---- nooooooooooo, that would be too much of another rock and roll cliche.<br/><br/>The last question - why are all rock managers English in these products? What is it about this country (mine) that makes them so ideal to be the fast talking fly-by-night 10 percenters? Maybe it is the accent that makes everything they say seem more real, correct and followable. ""Now Marky me-ladooo, drop your pants...

Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW).

"zardoz-13","5","0","1","7 February 2008"," Director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make ""Rock Star"" palatable
","Writing about flawed films sometimes is more fun than writing about fabulous ones. Flawed films interest me for what they aspired to rather than achieved. Take director Stephen Herek's ""Rock Star,"" for example, a cinematic experience as amiable but anemic as its generic title. The original title was ""Metal God,"" and the studio should have kept it. Somewhere beneath this superficial but alluring epic penned by actor, writer, & sometime director John Stockwell lurks a better movie. Imagine a diluted version of ""The Doors"" meets ""The Jazz Singer."" The shoddy third act resolution generates little catharsis. ""Rock Star"" lacks a physical villain, so our hero has nobody to contend with but himself. As charismatic as Mark Wahlberg is, he struggles valiantly to make an impression as a remote, aloof character devoid of ambiguity. Poor Jennifer Aniston vanishes in the second act, only to return late in act three to provide closure to a routine romance. Wahlberg and Aniston make a good couple, but their romance evaporates in act two. ""Rock Star"" is neither as provocative as 1979's ""The Rose"" with Bette Midler"" nor as satiric as Rob Reiner's classic ""This Is Spinal Tap."" This middle-of-the-road rock'n' roll opera doesn't rock enough but rolls briskly to its inevitable cautionary conclusion. Be yourself is the message. Essentially, Herek & Stockwell adapted the real-life Cinderella saga of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, an Akron, Ohio, musician who idolized British head bangers Judas Priest, but turned it into inoffensive potboiler. Happily, director Stephen Herek of ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" and ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" ushers a supremely competent cast through their paces. Even when this harmless, 106 minute expose of fame isn't terribly profound, Herek makes it infinitely easy to watch, thanks in part to both Ueli Steiger's atmospheric cinematography and Trudy Ship's snappy editing.<br/><br/>""Rock Star"" unfolds during the noisy Reagan years of the 1980s. By day, Pittsburgh native Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg of ""Three Kings"") toils as a photo-copier repair technician and lives at home in his parents' day-care center. (I liked the way Herek & Stockwell inserted the clever symbolism about a copier repairman who copies a rock star.) By night, Chris lets his hair down and boogies with Blood Pollution, a heavy-metal tribute band to fictitious British rockers Steel Dragon. Incidentally, neither Judas Priest nor Tim Owens sought to be associated with ""Rock Star,"" which explains why Herek & Stockwell have embellished things. Anyway, Chris has been grooving on Steel Dragon since his disappointed big brother Joe dumped their debut album in his lap. Bad blood exists between Chris and Joe; Joe happens to be a uniformed patrolman. Chris' girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston of TV's ""Friends"") serves as Blood Pollution's manager. So absorbed and obsessed is Chris with replicating Steel Dragon tunes riff for riff that he refuses to tolerate the least departure from their original material. Chris's fanaticism aggravates fellow guitarist & friend Rob (smarmy Timothy Olyphant of ""Scream 2"") who claims the fans won't object to his improvisations. Eventually, during a concert at a steel factory, Chris catches Rob improvising, and the two scrap on stage. Later, when Chris and Emily show up for a practice session in the basement of a porno movie theatre, Rob announces they have replaced Chris. An argument erupts, and Chris discovers to his horror that his friends consider themselves a 'cover band' instead of 'a tribute band.' They exploit Steel Dragon tunes to lure in audiences and then regale them with their own originals. Chris throws a tantrum and storms out with Emily at his heels. No sooner has this happened than Chris receives a call from Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West of ""28 Days"") of Steel Dragon. Initially, Chris suspects he is being duped until Kirk convinces him beyond a shadow of a doubt. Sworn to secrecy, Chris shares two of his groupie friends, Nina and Samantha, and Steel Dragon wants him to audition for lead singer. Chris and Emily fly out to L.A., and Chris discovers to his chagrin that Steel Dragon lead singer Bobby Beers is gay. Apparently, Bobby (Jason Flemyng of ""Snatch"") has been neglecting his responsibilities to the band, and Steel Dragon axes him.<br/><br/>Before long, Emily and Chris realize they cannot stay together. She heads off to Seattle with a girlfriend to open a coffee shop. Fellow band member A.C. (Jason Bonham, son of the late ""Led Zeppelin"" drummer John Bonham) advises Chris to let Emily go, too. Says A.C.: ""Your job is to live the fantasy other people only dream about. Dream big--live the life."" The next time Chris sees Emily, he is so wasted he doesn't realize he is in Seattle where she runs her coffee shop. Herek & Stockwell give this section of ""Rock Star"" the short shrift. Several scenes appear to be missing, because the drama dries up in the third act. Eventually, Chris learns success with Steel Dragon comes at a price. A.C. and Kirk write all the songs, and they scoff at Chris's ideas and songs. Unlike most movies where the characters neither grow nor evolve, Chris does grow and winds up hitting the road to do his own thing.<br/><br/>The cast performs splendidly. Mark Wahlberg is thoroughly persuasive as the naive, gullible Chris. The major shortcomings in ""Rock Star"" lay with John Stockwell's shallow script that gives Wahlberg nothing to work with in fleshing out a bone and blood character. Chris suffers minimally at the hands of Steel Dragon. He doesn't experience a baptism by fire that would reform him. Herek & Stockwell do an adequate job of recreating the era of big hair styles. This expose exposed little which hasn't already been exposed. The soundtrack qualifies as something of a consolation. The problem with ""Rock Star"" is it is just too upbeat. The performers are more interesting than their roles. Ultimately, director Stephen Herek's sense of style helps to make ""Rock Star"" palatable."

","I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You won't waste your popcorn on this one.

","I first saw this movie back in 2002 and fell in love with it. I agree it was never going to win any awards and the music is cheesy but does anyone remember the 80's? Come on now, the music was horrible! I think it was accurate on that point and I even have downloaded most of the soundtrack of 'Steel Dragon'! Mark Walberg was great as Chris ""Izzy"" Coles and the rest of the band was equally awesome to watch. I also think this movie teaches some very valuable lessons about life. Never sell out your friends cause you never know when they might land a great gig with a world famous band. Don't take your lady for granted cause she might take off and start a coffee house in Seattle. Lastly, don't take drugs because you quite possibly could end up at an all-night orgy party and sleep with a she-male. So all of who want to, join me and ""STAND UP AND SHOUT""!

Mark Wahlberg is awesome and his acting brings out a true to life Rock Star. Soundtrack is like a 9/10.

What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end.  It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery.

"penseur","Null","0","1","12 March 2004"," Uneven satire
","The script of this movie contains a mixture of elements which are variously funny, silly and painful, and generally it is pretty schizophrenic. Although the subject bands play heavy metal, the soundtrack is mostly what is described as hard rock (there is a  difference) and composed by people with talent, unlike what is supposed to be the case with ""Steel Dragon"". Unfortunately the soundtrack doesn't compensate for the formula dross that the bands play.  There are things which are just so unrealistic (has the scriptwriter ever tried to conduct a conversation with someone at the front of a rock concert?) that they just have to be dismissed.  Other things - like the life of debauchery in between composing and performing - are certainly spot-on, but which is no cause for joy for the spectators..  The first half of the film is mostly a humorous send-up a la ""Spinal Tap"", the second half becomes ponderous and quasi-philosophical.  The lead actor did nothing for me, but Timothy Spall is always good, and Jennifer Anniston is very easy on the eye, if not much else."

"poisonrock29","5","0","2","23 November 2003"," Quite good, need to see again.
","I live for 80's Hard Rock music and that's why i wanted to see this movie (and because Jennifer Aniston is in it).  I can remember when 80's Hard Rock was everywhere and i thought it would never die but unfortunately it did when the new Hip Hop sound came out.  Even at the end of Rock Star as the credits were rolling, Mark Wahlberg basically said Metal was out and Hip Hop was in, that's what happened in 1991 at the MTv music awards when the leaders of 80's Hard Rock, Poison, gave a memorable and very bad performance (due to the lead guitarist doing a solo in the middle of a song which caused an embarrasing situation and the song had to be started over again) which led to the end of this feel good music but that's another story (i'm trying not to ramble too much).  Rock Star was an okay movie which i feel i need to watch a second time to enjoy more.  It's shows the lifestyle of a Rock Star very well, not just the good points, but Rock Star points out all the downsides to being a Rock Star too, all the things we hear about have been put into film for our entertainment.  It's a fast moving movie which manages to hold your interest if your into this style of music, there is quite a bit of comedy too which is also worth mentioning to it's credit.  It's very obvious that Mark Wahlberg was miming when he was singing, the real voice was by Michael Matijevic of the band STEELHEART, and also some of it was by Mark Slaughter of SLAUGHTER, two of the best 80's Hard Rock bands.  You can tell Michael Matijevic's voice anywhere as it's so loud and piercing his voice can blow up your CD player if your not careful.  Rock tar is worth watching just for the music, anyone who remembers 80's Hard Rock will have their memories flowing back after watching this with a soundtrack from BON JOVI, DAVID LEE ROTH and AC'DC among others.  It would have been nice if some of the old Rock stars from the 80's were given guest appearances, especially Bret Michaels of Poison since he was so influential to the success of Hair Metal and he has an acting background too."

","Gotta love a movie that cant decide whether its glorifying something or villifiyng it. Odds are this was intended originally as a kick in the pants to the music business, but as production moved along, the whole concept of movies being a business took over. So in order to make this rotter marketable, the producers chickened out and end up advertising for the very things they are seeking to expose. Marky Mark is cool, but he and his agents had better learn how to read a script. There is so much wrong with this film, it would take too long fo me to write it, and for you to read it. If Jennifer Aniston wasn't basically topless, calm down, she isnt, but what she wears might actually may be more tantalizing than if she did strut around the entire movie like tarzan.

","Let me say I play hard rock and am a hard rock historian.  While this movie didn't flat out suck, it could have been done much better with more key to detail.  Some points I might add..<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is losely based on the Judas Priest story but if you know your Judas Priest none of the movie is really accuarate.  Halford left priest on his own doing and was not fired.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>First off Herek should have used somebody other than Walhberg to play the part of ""hero"", given Mark's past as a 'rapper' and having no real knowledge of such a situation involving heavy metal singing (movie or not).</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>Keep in mind the movie takes place about the mid 80s (say 84-86 max) yet while the soundtrack is good, some of the actual songs in the soundtrack were written/recorded much later than the supposed time frame of the movie (Bon Jovi - ""Slippery When Wet"" in 1986, Motley Crue ""Wildside"" in 1987, and AC/DC ""Are You Ready"" in 1990).  Sloppily done and researched.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Accoring to the movie, Izzy (Wahlberg) comes in to replace Beers about 1985, does a few tours, puts out one album, and then seeminngly ""walks out"" within a two year time zone.  Again, sloppily done given what real life is. Even some of the worst of the many replacement singers that have come in to many a 'real-life' metal bands had a tenure of much more than just ""2-3"" years (recording a new album and a subsquent tour alone often takes up more than a year).  Blaze Bayley spent 6-7 years in Iron Maiden alone after Bruce Dickinson left.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending is stupid, showing Izzy leaving a larger than life metal band to supposedly ""finding his love"" of playing crappy alternative music in some local bars.  (Again, the timing thing.  Alternative music didnt explode until really the mid 90s and the movie has him doing this at maybe 1990 the latest, back when hair metal was still ruling).  Not to mention 20 years from now many of us are gonna look back and wonder why ""alternative music"" was so overhyped (most of it sucked).</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all -- an okay movie.  Could have been done much better.  Wasnt too well-received (probably because of the inaccuaracies) and thats why it wasnt at theatres too long."

","Although I liked Almost Famous too but Rock Star is really my Rock & Roll movie. Of course the plot is predictable, It isn't like the Doors or Almost Famous with a biographical story formula, but nobody as in nobody has ever attempted to write and direct a story about 80's Rock music and it's lifestyle, This one nailed it right. The problem is, when you put a very slow exposition of the characters and slow pacing in the film it tends to get boring, Rock Star's plot is well paced and focuses not only on the characters but on the music and lifestyle too.<br/><br/>The ending wherein Chris Cole(Mark Wahlberg) passes the mic to a wannabe and sees his final glimpse of Rock and Roll accompanying with a very powerful dramatic rock score is my favorite scene in the film. The Love Story blends well in it too, It is balanced not like Almost famous wherein Rock Music is just a supporting story, Here everybody is a star the Characters whether big or small roles, the simple plot, the music, everything.<br/><br/>For over the years I really missed the 80's music and this is really what I've been waiting for, A movie tribute to the bands and music of the 80's to early 90's who are gone and out of the pop scene completely ignored by this generation of today.

"Metalsquirrel","5","0","1","13 August 2002"," Rock Star promises much but stumbles (Warning!!! Contains Spoilers)
","When I heard that a film was in the works based on the real life search for the replacement of former Judas Priest singer Rob Halford I was intrigued. After months of Internet hype, I was genuinely excited. After seeing the movie, however, I was left wanting.<br/><br/>(Warning!!! Spoilers Ahead)<br/><br/>Truth be told, there were aspects of this film that I enjoyed. For one, the original music written for Rock Star is excellent. Moreover, the previously released music supplied by Motley Crüe, Bon Jovi, and Ted Nugent rocks as well. However, therein lies one of the major drawbacks of this film-when the final credits rolled, I had an incredible urge to buy the soundtrack; not to see this movie again.<br/><br/>I did not rush out to see this movie again because I felt that I had been cheated story wise. The non-fictional events took place this way: A man works hard by day and at night, works even harder fronting a Judas Priest cover band. This cover band could have easily given in and started playing grunge or alternative music to please more people. However, they stick to the music that they love and one of them gets the opportunity to front the band that they all revere. When given this opportunity, Tim `Ripper' Owens, seizes it with both hands and to this day, is still the lead singer for Judas Priest. Seems made for Hollywood, right? A classic tale of holding on to your dreams, working hard, and taking advantage of the opportunity when (and most importantly, if) it knocks.<br/><br/>Something happened when the cameras started rolling though. What Rock Star became was a story of a man who gets an opportunity to fulfill his dreams but throws it all away because he mistreated his girlfriend. Moreover, he cuts his hair and starts an alternative band!!! I understand that Hollywood has to make a movie accessible to the public but turning a film that should have been about a love for a form of music into a trite `boy cheats on girl, boy loses girl, boy gives up everything to get girl back' love story is too much!<br/><br/>I know that some people may not understand that true metal musicians would find it hard to swallow this picture. I also understand that the audience that will find this film appealing are the people that are fans of Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. Unfortunately, sticking to the original story that got George Clooney interested in this project would have made a better film. If you are looking for a date flick disguised as an ode to 80's metal then Rock Star is for you. However, you are not going to be satisfied if you think that Rock Star is the movie that finally chronicles the hard rocking 80's."

","Watching Rock Star is like watching the 'Spinal Tap' episode of<br/><br/>The Simpsons stretched over two hours, except all of the laughs are missing.<br/><br/>Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is a Steel Dragon fanatic, dedicating his life to imitating lead singer Bobby (Flemying) and playing in his tribute band. When his over-serious, perfectionist attitude leads to an onstage brawl Chris is thrown out, mirroring the ejection of Bobby from the real Steel Dragon for being gay (He is colourfully referred to as a ""sausage jockey"" by his bandmates""). This opens the door for Chris, who joins the band and jumps feet-first into the hedonism of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) along for the ride.  As Chris becomes embroiled in the trappings of fame and alienated from Emily, she leaves and he starts to question the validity of what he's doing.<br/><br/>Well shot and acted, with nice stylistic touches from Herek, the problem with Rock Star is that it's just plain boring. At no pont do we care about the characters, with their distinct absence of chemistry, and the concert sequences, although spectacular, are repetitive and soulless. The only redeeming feature comes from Timothy Spall as the vulgar road manager, Mats.<br/><br/>

","30 minutes into 'Rock Star', you'll feel like you're watching a made for TV movie.  The entire first half hour is so totally unbelievable and cheesy that you will really start to regret that you rented (or bought) this movie. Thankfully, it does get better after that, but not much.  Even after the first half hour, though, the movie does suffer from it's moments of inability to suspend disbelief.  Probably the worst of this, aside from the first 30 minutes, is the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character simply abandons his hair metal band, and next thing we know he's playing 'sensitive' music in an early-90s coffehouse in Seattle and wearing flannel and sweaters.<br/><br/>The mere fact that, historically, grunge was a reaction AGAINST 80's hair metal makes this ending completely laughable.  Personally, I was hoping that Jennifer Aniston's character leaving for Seattle halfway through the movie was a foreshadowing of an ending that would've been much more entertaining: Her character joining the late 80's Seattle grunge scene, and then at the end of the movie (presumably circa 1991) during the 'grunge explosion', she becomes rich and famous and Mark Wahlberg ends up crawling back as nothing but a broken has-been. :)"

The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest.  If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. However, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star.   I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes.

","If you are a twenty or thirtysomething who can appreciate Motley Crew, Poison, or any other 80s glam metal band than this movie is for you. Rock Star is a period piece examining the life and times of one cheese metal band, Steel Dragon and their new front man Chris ""Izzy don't call me Marky"" Cole. <br/><br/>Rock Star succeeds where Almost Famous doesn't, in that it accurately (for the most part) depicts and portrays the nostalgia of the time, the music, and most of all, the fans. Rock Star encompasses a solid fundamental core of film traits that aid in establishing it as a worthy video rental. The plot is predictable yet believable, the acting is above average, the set design is fairly accurate, and the pacing of the movie is fast enough to keep the viewer involved as well as entertained. Most important, the movie does not take itself too seriously. During the end credits ""Good Vibrations"" is played which I felt was humorous and refreshing, as well as an accurate portal of the transition period of the early 90s between glam metal and Seattle grunge.  <br/><br/>However, the movie is not without its fair share of technical glitches and the cinematography is not subtle - it's more like a Def Leppard video. If you are a fan of the music and grew up in the 80s you might enjoy this one. Otherwise, if you are going to be overtly cynical or generally have contempt for the glam metal counterculture you might want to stick to VH-1 Behind the Music and save yourself the $4 rental fee. I can appreciate the music so I gave this flick a well earned 6/10 - mostly for its technical accuracies of the music, culture, and the time period."

","First of all, the genre of this movie isn't comedy, it's more of a drama.<br/><br/>I had low expectations on the movie, and still they didn't come up them.

But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi, or Mötley Crue, it'll be more quality time.<br/><br/>Last, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend ""Almost Famous""."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","15 February 2002"," Good story, imperfectly done, but very entertaining.
","SPOILERS - Even though not great, by any measure, we enjoyed this film very much, Wahlberg and Anniston giving very nice performances. It's median rating of ""7"" is about right.  Walhberg is a copier repairman in Pittsburgh, but also lead singer for a ""tribute"" band copying the Steel Dragons. Meanwhile the ""Dragons"" are firing their lead singer, get wind of Wahlberg, audition him, and hire him as he takes the name ""Izzy."" Reportedly this closely parallels what had happened to a real rock band in the 80s.<br/><br/>
The film is about Izzy's transformation. He goes from frustrated ""tribute"" singer only wanting to copy his heros, to the lead singer and hero himself, to wanting to write his own songs, to quitting when he realizes his direction is wrong. And the band leaders will not let him participate in writing.<br/><br/>During his months with the Steel Dragons he becomes a person even he doesn't like, loses his girlfriend, Anniston, stays stoned most of the time, participates in meaningless sex.  After he quits, they meet up and presumably resume their love relationship. The transformation complete.<br/><br/>It's a good story which has a moral and ends well. The music, and DVD soundtrack, are good throughout.  Although Wahlberg does some of his own singing, a better singer ""assists"" and at critical times the sound track transitions seamlessly from one to the other, so that it really looks like Wahlberg is doing all his own singing.  Good production, nicely entertaining, some nudity and blue language."

Mark Wahlberg played the identical role that he had in ""Boogie Nights"" and he played it the same way, nice kid, eager to please, making the audience root for him to succeed. He is pleasing to look at and truly a talented performer, so that was the high point, but other than his performance, there is very little meat in this film and at the end, when we have all gotten our lesson in rock and roll debauchery, we are sent on our way with little return for our buck.

","It's a revelation to me that people haved raved about this film.  I couldn't imagine who, except Mark Wahlberg fans, the target audience was supposed to be.  Running against the grain of the huge current popularity of modern metal, the film is set 15 years ago when Heart and Bon Jovi rocked the world and features a soundtrack of screaming-guitar poodle-perm AOR.  No genuine Heavy metal or new metal fan is going to enjoy it.  Jennifer Anniston is missing for a huge chunk at the middle, and the romance story is pretty incidental, so there go the girls and the Friends fans.  It's not even that funny, so there's no word of mouth about the laughs or the great set-pieces. Did you even realise this was directed by the same man who gave the world Bill and Ted and Don't Tell Monm the Baby-sitter's Dead?

"jvframe","Null","0","2","15 November 2001"," Heavy Metal = mysogyny and homophobia (at least in 1985)
","It's 1985, well before Boy Bands ruled the Earth  but it's still an age when the dinosaurs of Heavy Metal command a devoted and fanatic following.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, a cute longhair headbanger who fronts Pittsburg's most genuine ""Steel Dragon Tribute Band"". He has lived and breathed Steel Dragon since his older brother bought their first LP, hated it and gave it to Chris rather than throw it in the bin. The music speaks to Chris's very soul, but unknown to Chris, and most of Steel Dragon's fans, is the fact that their leather-clad and studded front man, Bobby Beers, is totally and utterly gay. <br/><br/>Steel Dragon know their fan base is waning and realise that the main consumers of Heavy Metal are young men who want to be just like the Rock Stars and pull heaps of chicks while taking lots of drugs. Bobby was getting far too out and proud, even on-stage. He had to go.<br/><br/>The scenario of Rock Star is based on the real life circumstances of British proto-metal band, Judas Priest, whose openly gay ex-lead singer Rob Halford continues to enjoy a successful solo career - performing and recording heavy metal rock.<br/><br/>The original music is arranged by Trevor Rabin - the cute young rock star guitarist who put life into Yes when Steve Howe left that band in 1985. Tracks from classic metal artists like Kiss and Mottley Crue fill out the score. It all sounds huge and satisfyingly powerful (pick a cinema with a big sound system). <br/><br/>The now 100% hetero and ultra-macho Steel Dragon then proceed to bonk and drug their way across America, following the philosophy of Spinal Tap's drummer: ""If I had the sex and the drugs, then I could do without the rock'n'roll!"" Jennifer Aniston turns in a sterling performance as the girlfriend/manager who wants to see Chris succeed in rock'n'roll, but who quickly realises why Keith Richards looks like he's 150 years old.<br/><br/>This is entertainment by virtue of good music, lavish direction and fine performances all round. Timothy Olyphant (Dennis in ""Broken Hearts Club"") is good, Timothy Spall is great as the tour manager and Mark Wahlberg convinced me that he can act, in spite of being cursed with exceptionally tragic beauty."

At least she extended herself past that for a change.  <br/><br/>After the half way point however, specifically after Wahlberg's first big concert, the movie goes downhill.

I must say that's it's almost a shame they put that ""metal"" chorus on ""We All Die Young"", because that song is radio hit potential.<br/><br/>As for comparing this movie to Almost Famous, well, maybe it's another rock band, but no, this one is a best entertainment than Almost Famous, but Almost Famous is more original and more ""serious""."

Amazingly, he is upset and initially unwilling to live the life and sticks with his girl, his previous ""band manager"" and useless waste of space Aniston, reprising every bad role she ever did. The movie can't decide whether to be an all-out comedy (the Mom and Pa duo are much more interesting than the rest of the movie) but ultimately it's a couple of hours of mindless entertainment.

If you were active into movies and music in the 80's, you will appreciate what I think this movie is trying to get across which is nostalgia with humor and music. From the lead actors obsessive compulsive fascination with the band and lead singer of the group which he has formed a 'tribute band' for (which everyone else calls a cover band much to his dismay) to the movies' rock opera-ish metal songs with the 'rock chix' that flared back in the 80's to the films soundtrack featuring Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Talking Heads, Def Leppard, and other of your shameful dusty favorites (you've sung them at karaoke night in the pub..admit it).

From almost the beginning, it's like the whole idea of Rock Star is to talk about the evil of the music industry and how people treat each other and by about 3/4 of the way in, you feel like it's being slammed over your head.<br/><br/>That whole morale gets old real fast and much of the comedy and pleasure in the film is quickly swept away before you can even laugh again.

"RawkStah","5","0","1","6 September 2001"," Decent date movie, nothing more.
","Briefly, Rock Star is a fairy tale. It's not really about rock and roll. It's about a male Cinderella (a Cinderfella, if you will, and if you don't mind a Jerry Lewis reference) who, instead of marrying a prince, marries a rock band... but at what cost?<br/><br/>This movie has several hurdles to clear -- This Is Spinal Tap, Wayne's World 2, and ""VH1's Behind The Music"". The audience already knows what happens in a rock and roll band. Thankfully, the movie isn't out to top anything or be a cautionary tale. It's just there to entertain.<br/><br/>If you've seen any trailers for this movie, you'll know what the story is: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a Steel Dragons tribute (NOT cover) band called Blood Pollution. When the lead singer for SD is fired, Cole is recruited to join as the new lead singer. Begin rise of fame. During his career with SD, his relationship with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) is strained. Will things work out? Will Steel Dragons be able to keep fans with a new lead singer? WILL HAIR METAL SURVIVE? All of these questions will be answered in the movie, if not here.<br/><br/>Although the movie is based around a fictional band, certain activities didn't need to be made up. Just as Hannibal Lecter is a combination of several serial killers, Steel Dragons is based on several metal bands. Nods are given to Judas Priest, Black Flag, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Guns 'n' Roses, Van Halen, and probably a host of others I can't think of right now. Adding to Rock Star's r&r credibilty is the casting of Zakk Wylde (one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists) and Jason Bonham (a drummer, and son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham). So, the music is going to be of high quality, regardless of your feelings towards hair metal as a genre.<br/><br/>
The movie is set in the mid-1980s, when post-glam hair metal was making big strides in top-40 music. This distinction is very important. Steel Dragons is not Twisted Sister or Motley Crue or Judas Priest or Metallica. It's more in the vein of Def Leppard or Winger or Bon Jovi. Girls will like this band. Cole (who is known to the public as Izzy) will not scare girls like Lemmy from Motorhead. The time that the movie is doubly important in that it happens before hair metal becomes a parody of itself, and, even more importantly, before the dread beast from the Northwest emerges from Seattle. It happens during the glory days of hair metal. Power ballads? Absolutely. Guitarists moving in unison? You bet. Tight leather pants? Oh, yeah. Once upon a time, this was actually cool, and not campy or homoerotic. Well, in retrospect, it was always homoerotic, but girls still liked it. And, that's what rock and roll is all about.<br/><br/>However, it's not what the movie is about -- it is about, to steal the tagline, ""a wannabe who got to be"". Here's where the movie tends to disappoint. The cast was incredibly talented, but the characters are fairly one-dimensional. Which is not to say that the performances were bad -- some of the scenes were incredibly passionate, but I would have liked to have seen more character in the characters. Chris Cole is, to put it bluntly, a geek. He knows things about Steel Dragons that would put a Trekkie who sleeps in his Spock ears and could write a 20-page dissertation on why Kirk is a far better captain than Picard to shame. Details about the color of the thread in costumes, what year and tour a particular outfit was worn, not to mention lyrics and choreography. This kid is devoted to his dream. Emily has a head for business, and is devoted to Chris. I really would have liked to have seen more backstory between these two characters. As they were written, however, I felt just a little bit left out. The character of Miggs (Spall) however, was just about perfect. He is THE roadie. Not the god-of-all-roadies that we saw in Wayne's World 2, but just a guy who can get the job done. And, of course, as this is a fairy tale, he is as close as we come to a fairy godmother.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good character study within an industry, watch Boogie Nights. If you're looking for a date movie, Rock Star is probably better. And less awkward."
