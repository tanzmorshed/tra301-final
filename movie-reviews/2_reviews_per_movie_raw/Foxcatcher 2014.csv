","The saga of John du Pont is one of the more bizarre and tragic stories from the mid-1990s. In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.<br/><br/>Like Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.<br/><br/>As du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened."
"PostingandToasting","8","70","96","26 December 2014"," Foxcatcher: A Slow Burn to an Explosive Climax.
","Foxcatcher is a movie for those who value patience as a virtue. There is not a lot of dialogue and not even a lot of wrestling (which is bold for a movie centered around Olympic wrestlers) but rarely have I seen a film that had a constant buildup of tension throughout. One phrase that you will see a lot when reading about this film is that it is a ""slow burn"" which is accurate. It makes you uncomfortable and anxious to the point of frustration because you are constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br/><br/>The story centers around Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) an anti-social, brooding athlete who seems to be constantly living in his older brother David's (Mark Ruffalo) shadow. David and Mark have both won gold medals at the 1984 Olympics but more people are drawn to David because he is warm, charismatic, and open...everything that Mark is not. We watch Mark as he seems to go through life with a chip on his soldier, trying to forge his own path without the help of his brother. Mark receives a call from a representative of a John Du Pont (Steve Carell) who wishes Mark to visit him on his Foxcatcher farm and propose the idea of him and the entire USA wrestling team to make Foxcatcher their official training facility with Du Pont bankrolling the entire operation. From there, we watch an initial positive relationship sour as the we learn more about Du Pont and his intentions.<br/><br/>The cast is lights out here. Tatum gives the performance of his career in a dark turn as Mark and Ruffalo might score an Oscar nomination for being the one ray of light as his older brother David, who only has the best intentions for Mark and his future. It is Carell though, who steals the show. You always read about how comedians, whom Carell is more popularly known as, all have a ""dark side"" in them which is where they get there comedy from that allows them to make shockingly effective transition into drama (think Jim Carrey in ""Truman Show"" and Robin Williams in ""Insomnia"") and he will go down as another prime example of that here. Du Pont is a man of privilege who, like Mark, is trying to find a way to make his mark on the world and seek the approval of others. He is socially awkward, maybe even a coward and uses his money and family ""dynasty"" as its referred to in the film, to give him a sense of entitlement to gain respect from others.<br/><br/>From the point they meet we wonder why Mark would fall into a relationship with Du Pont but we see they do share similarities in terms of their personalities and both feeling the need to prove themselves. So it's no surprise to see the relationship eventually sour because in the fight to become the more relevant one, Du Pont will win due to his already established social status and wealth. Du Pont is always trying to seek the approval of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who sees wrestling as a ""low sport"", and Du Pont tries to create this deluded fantasy of what he is trying to do with this wrestling team to please his mother. Du Pont calls himself a ""coach"" of the wrestling team, when it seems he knows nothing about the sport, he claims his athletes see him as a mentor and a father figure when in reality, he is just the guy signing their checks. The tension comes to a head once David gets involved and begins to see Du Pont for what he really is and the climax catches you buy surprise and leaves you devastated. .<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller has only made three films (Capote and Moneyball the other two) but it's safe to say he is three for three with this being his most ambitious work yet. Foxcatcher is the type of film that has failed in the past due to its' modest pace but the performances keep you engaged just enough to be blown away in the end."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","88","126","27 November 2014"," A chilling, quiet psychological drama about men striving for greatness
","""Foxcatcher"" is anything but a wrestling drama. Although based on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz and his brief years of training under multi-millionaire John du Pont, ""Foxcatcher"" expands well beyond the wrestling ring into the minds of two men longing to find greatness.<br/><br/>So those expecting anything close to director Bennett Miller's last film, ""Moneyball,"" should be forewarned. This is not a sports movie, but a slow-burning character study (like Miller's first acclaimed film, ""Capote"") in which the wrestling serves as the visual, physical expression of the psychological struggle between the characters.<br/><br/>When we first meet Mark, played by Channing Tatum, whose versatility continues to amaze, it's 1987 and he is living in the faded glory of his 1984 gold medal. Despite his success, he is living a rather lonely life and itching to accomplish more; his brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also won gold and Dave feels that leaves him with something to prove. So when John du Pont (Steve Carell) contacts him about paying him to come train at his top-notch facility on his family's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, he sees his opportunity.<br/><br/>Mark and du Pont's philosophies about striving to be the best align, and the two form a close, almost father-and-son bond, though more so because they both feel pressure to live up to others' expectations. Du Pont, in particular, wants to prove himself to his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who breeds world class horses and finds wrestling barbaric. John's desperation, bottomless checkbook and unresolved family issues make for a dangerous combination, and his relationship with Mark slowly begins to change for the worse. Further complicating the matter is Dave, the only man capable of saving Mark from his demanding expectations of himself and whose coaching expertise intimidates du Pont.<br/><br/>The often unspoken psychological warfare between the three (and, perhaps most importantly, du Pont and his mother) is the driving force of the story more than anything that actually happens on screen. Mark's ups and downs as he competes at the '87 World Championships and '88 Olympic trials are symptomatic of his mental state and the state of his relationship with the other men. As such, ""Foxcatcher"" is a long, at times brooding film that can drag in spite of the brilliant character development and internal drama.<br/><br/>E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's script is quiet and doesn't have a lot of big juicy moments for its actors to lean on, so the fact that Carell is totally haunting and captivating in this role says a lot. Du Pont is an incredibly complex character whose back story is mostly implied so as to keep him as unpredictable as possible. Even with all the makeup on, Carell gives the epitome of an understated performance, something you would never dream possible from a guy who has made a career out of big acting and abrasive characters. Undoubtedly some credit goes to Miller, who has churned out acting nominations and wins for his previous casts, and gets Carell and Tatum to pause and linger at all the right moments.<br/><br/>With those two in transforming roles, it's easy to overlook Ruffalo (who always seems to get overlooked). Dave is the comparison point for both these men. He's a family man who is smart, has accomplished a lot and knows what it truly means to work hard. Ruffalo brings his trademark authenticity to his part as the ""good guy"" and does it so well.<br/><br/>Even when it's too quiet and languishes, ""Foxcatcher"" is a fine piece of cinema and Miller has established himself as a true auteur. It certainly does not satisfy in the mainstream sense, but its purposeful use of imagery, total avoidance of melodrama and magnifying glass on the human condition make it an undeniably sharp and intelligent art film to be sure.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"left-of-center","5","24","35","1 April 2015"," Missing a True Emotional Core
","I'm usually on the same page as movie critics and fans when it comes to awards season flicks. But, I just don't get the massive acclaim for ""Foxcatcher"", Bennett Miller's based-on-a-true-story drama about the fractured relationships between two Olympic wrestling brothers, Mark and Dave Schultz (Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo), and their mentally disturbed benefactor, John du Pont (Steve Carell). Do I think it's a terrible film? I won't go that far. But, nothing about it emotionally moved me or made me think too much. I think it's just one of those movies that come off as so ""serious"" that the knee-jerk reaction is praise.<br/><br/>Here's my main problem: the storytelling and characters are so hollow. I don't know if this was Miller's point but there's a way to depict emptiness and hollowness without the film feeling empty and hollow itself. Many people describe this as a ""slow burn"" that requires patience and concentration from a viewer. I have plenty of both and tend to usually enjoy slower films. But, it's not the slowness that some people are reacting to. It's the deadness at the center.<br/><br/>We get no deep insight into any of the characters, except for John in rare moments, besides what they say superficially. What was it that really ruined the relationship between Mark and John? Jealousy, insecurity, betrayal, suppressed homoeroticism? What did Dave really think of John? And why exactly did Mark spiral so dramatically? <br/><br/>Now, I do appreciate ambiguity in characters and film very much. Not everything has to be obvious, cut-and-dry. But, if you're going to make the characters an enigma, at least give us more to work with to be able to figure them out. Instead, ""Foxcatcher"" disappointingly stays on the surface, making us guess way too much instead of diving deep into these people, who, given the fact that they're real, leave plenty of room to explore.<br/><br/>Because of this, the tragic ending left me pretty cold. John is such an empty shell throughout that we're never fully let into his inner world. We never get to completely understand his insanity. We're always on the outside of this character, looking in. As a result, his actions just feel disconnected and unexplainable. And the fact that the film ends so abruptly, without making us fully feel the impact of this horrible event, makes it even odder to digest.<br/><br/>Luckily, the performances of Carell and Ruffalo save the show and made it somewhat watchable. Carell joins the lengthy list of hilarious comedians capable of moving dramatic work. Known to audiences as a lovable, heart-warming goofball, he totally transforms and channels a still, unsettling intensity. I squirmed watching some of his scenes, as he was so palpably awkward and in pain, while making the aloof way the character was written work. Ruffalo is a great character actor yet always brings his own brand of sweetness and groundedness to every role. He has a way of making his characters seem totally real and recognizable. Here, he stands out as the most relatable, appealing member of the bunch. Their Oscar nominations were well-deserved.<br/><br/>Now, as far as Tatum goes, I did not see the brilliant, career-changing performance many were raving about. He was more or less his same one-note, depthless self, except he was given a few ridiculously showy scenes here. But, he still underwhelmed me. This part is really the central role and a truly gifted actor could've done so much with it. Mark is naive, ambitious, intense, obsessive, immature, and vulnerable. Yet, in Tatum's hands, who seems to be under the impression that stone-faced staring is great acting, he generally just comes off as dim and foolish, missing all of the emotional layers that should've been there (which could be another reason why it just failed to resonate with me).<br/><br/>If I had to recommend this, it'd only be for Carell and Ruffalo, who both act circles around Tatum. I can understand what Miller was trying to do with the film. Yet, I don't feel compelled to revisit."
"ClaytonDavis","8","71","117","11 October 2014"," Bennett Miller's latest is a building block of passion and tension with a righteous performance from Steve Carell...
","A film that takes its time presenting its case, Bennett Miller's wickedly brutal ""Foxcatcher"" entices audiences to learn more about the questions around us, and where they could lead. Seated firmly in the center are a trio of dazzling performances from Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo, all of which make a compelling case for their career best works.<br/><br/>Written by Oscar-nominee Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye, ""Foxcatcher"" tells the story of Mark Schultz (Tatum), an Olympic wrestler who befriends billionaire John Du Pont (Carell) in the mid-1980's. Along with his brother Dave (Ruffalo) and his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), that new relationship leads to unforeseen consequences.<br/><br/>At the core of this morality tale is Bennett Miller, the Oscar- nominated director of ""Capote"" and ""Moneyball."" He allows""Foxcatcher"" to study its subjects, and give the audience an in-depth understanding of all the motives involved. With the help of Cinematographer Greig Fraser, and composer Rob Simonsen, the movie's melancholy atmosphere is truly compelling. Miller's brilliance isn't in things he chooses to show, but in the things he chooses not to. He draws out scenes that offer so much to the narrative. There's still so much left on the table that we do not know, which in itself, is perfectly acceptable. Life never gives us all the answers we seek. Miller, Futterman, and Frye understand this. Material like this calls to be made into a film. I'm so glad that these three answered the call.<br/><br/>What Steve Carell achieves as John DuPont is not just a performance by a full embodiment. With strength and precision, he understands DuPont, a man with an extreme outlook on reality. Carell doesn't just ask us to sympathize with John, between his awkward behavior and his constant yearning to impress his family's legacy, he demands our understanding. If I didn't already know about the film for the past two years, I wouldn't have recognized him. His performance is completely focused and profound. Looking at the way he carries himself through the film, you are witnessing one of the purest creations of a character this year. When he's not on-screen, you're secretly wishing he was.<br/><br/>When it comes to Channing Tatum, I have to admit that I never FULLY understood the appeal. Discovered the young ferocious actor in Dito Montiel's ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" nearly a decade ago, and afterwards was only mildly entertained by his presence in films like ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Side Effects."" What he does in Miller's film is something beyond anything I could have ever thought he could do. Tatum doesn't just do an imitation, he channels the inner workings of a man desperate for more. His peculiarities are richly on display as he yearns for a father figure outside of the shadow of his more successful brother. He embraces the odd DuPont, against all logical instincts, but you can see exactly why he would feel so compelled to do so. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo gives Dave the ticks and beats of an original creation. Picking at his beard (something I know all too well), constantly engaging in team leadership, and hugging his younger brother whose more of a son than anything. Ruffalo mounts himself on the perch of a loving brother just trying to create success for himself and his family. This is another solid outing for him. <br/><br/>Co-star Vanessa Redgrave, as John's fragile mother, is marvelous in her short scenes while Sienna Miller adds a needed dynamic to understanding both Mark and Dave. The two women both offer compassion and balance.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is terrifying, disturbing, and utterly engaging. A slowly unraveled piece that is risky but pays off immensely. It's cautious yet strictly well-defined as a character study. Like all great films with great performances, its element of truth is plainly apparent. On the gray-skied farm, we will get to know three interesting men, some of which, we'll never truly understand."
"deloudelouvain","7","4","4","5 December 2017"," Never heard of this story and that was a bonus
","Foxcatcher is a long movie but it never gets boring and that's something. As a Belgian I never heard of this story so for me it was all a surprise. I like movies based on a true story, certainly one like this one. The make-up crew should also get credits because what they did to Steve Carrell and Channing Tatum was very well done. It's because Steve Carrell as a specific voice that I recognized him immediately but with his changed physics I could have been fooled. He plays a really annoying character, one of those rich guys that thinks you can buy anybody or anything. But he did a very good job playing that arrogant prick. Channing Tatum looks like he came out straight of a cavern. He also did a good job, like all the rest of the cast. The story is interesting to watch and the end was surprising to me. I'm not a big fan of the wrestling sport but for this story it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Certainly worth a watch."
"RyanCShowers","Null","37","59","30 December 2014"," Haunts with Uneasy Themes and a Deliberate Reveal of Information
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERS<br/><br/>Hearing reactions from people who saw ""Foxcatcher"" made me instill a mindset in myself to defend against the ""slow pacing"". (Feeling the discomfort from a long running-time is a movie pet peeve of mine.) However, my experience of ""Foxcatcher"" was largely different from most everyone else who has discussed the film. I did not want to take my eyes off the screen. The direction from Bennett Miller felt in tune with the story and the characters in a mellow way. He built scenes at a gradual pace, but each scene has a path and reach a distinctive point of impact. Because ""Foxcatcher"" is so muted, it haunts with the uneasy themes being explored in the screenplay and a deliberate reveal of information in the directing.<br/><br/>The ominous representations of the real-life people by the actors contribute substantially to the outcome of ""Foxcatcher"". Steve Carell amazed me in his portrayal of John du Pont. It's not the most expressive work of an actor this year, but it's certainly one of the most potent. The comedic actor is transformative and in more ways than the physical ones prompted by the make-up prosthetics, which visibly add to the creation of the mysterious figure. Carell's eyes cut deep into the viewer and sting like a sharp razor blade impaling the warmth of your flesh.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" begins as Mark Shultz's story and continues into the film's second act led by Channing Tatum's irate temperament. But the closer the end of the film nears, du Pont begins to consume the story. Carell's performance feels extraordinarily subtle as your start the film, but as ""Foxcatcher"" endangers the viewer deeper into du Pont's mind, the severity of Carell's performance begins permeate throughout the picture. There's an eerie presence he creates, a torment that does not internally leave you after watching it. (Not to suggest that du Pont is evil, as understood in Miller's direction, there's an nuance of tragedy that looms over the man that makes his story such a grave one to experience.)<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo's Dave Schultz becomes a driving figure in the last act, along with Carell, as Tatum's importance begins to lessen. The simple, small-town guy with a beacon of knowledge realized by Ruffalo is impressive. Tatum also gives his most accomplished performance to date.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller steps back tonally to his work in somber ""Capote"" after making the lighter (and forgettable) ""Moneyball"" in 2011. ""Foxcatcher"" is in the same quality league as ""Capote"", but in film he has a peculiar manner of creating the action of the plot. Some may say ""Foxatcher"" contains too few and far between events in the narrative, but I think Miller creates a drama palpable in the air of every scene, and we, the audience, are parked in a burning tension for two hours.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is a superb film that, as it sits in your mind, grows from the seeds Miller plants in your head as you watch his detailed recounting of events on the du Pont estate. It will disturb you with its bleak vegetation and seduce your flames of darkness.<br/><br/>Grade: A-<br/><br/>* * * 1/2 / * * * *"
"trublu215","10","84","145","4 November 2014"," A harrowing and disturbing character study with excellent performances
","Foxcatcher tells the fateful story of John Du Pont and the Olympic winning Schultz brothers. Directed by Bennett Miller, Foxcatcher taps into the psychology behind Du Pont, examining his psyche in the most disturbing of fashions. Steve Carrel delivers a performance that many will find hard to swallow. He is dry, he is awkward, and he is completely insane. To keep it simple, Steve Carrel is absolutely terrific and truly shows his range as an actor. It is an amazing performance that is bound for Oscar glory. The other half to Carrel's Du Pont is Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz. Tatum completely drowns into his character, leading him to turn in a vicious, unapologetic performance that is so perfectly executed that you will soon forget that this is Channing Tatum. When he is on screen, he is Mark Schultz. It is the best performance that Tatum has given in his career and stands to grab a possible Best Suppoting Actor nod at this year's Oscars. The voice of reason for both Mark and Du Pont lies in Dave Schultz, played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo. Dave serves as this mediator in between Mark and Du Pont especially when their relationship starts becoming more and more intense and violent. The rest of the cast featuring Vannessa Redgrave and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in very sound and great performances as well. As far as acting is concerned, Foxcatcher is a hard film to beat. Every actor is on top of their game here and it really shows how good of a director Bennet Miller is. He takes a seemingly dry script and turns it into an emotional roller-coaster by way of his actors. One scene in particular haunted me involving a simple glare from Tatum's Mark Schultz as he peddles faster and harder upon seeing Du Pont. That scene on paper isn't that interesting but with Miller's uncanny ability to make even the simplest scenes intricate and layered, it works and remains one of the more memorable scenes from the film. The other highlight from this film has to be the cinematography. Everything is filmed with a slight tint of dread and gray, it creates the mood immediately and balances the story perfectly. Overall, Foxcatcher is a great character study featuring top notch performances that push this film into the top ten of the year easily."
"fs-87-946563","8","46","76","11 November 2014"," Fox hunting is a bloody sport and so is wrestling
","Fox hunting is a bloody sport and in the case of Foxcatcher, so is wrestling. You can hear the thud and almost feel the pain as heavily muscled male bodies pound each other. It's almost like a ritual. John DuPont, billionaire and unbalanced eccentric, offers a talented young wrestler the kind of sponsorship that one can only dream of. Why then does Mark Schultz, ensconced in a luxurious guest house with a state-of-the-art training facility, feel so uneasy? Mr. DuPont, played by Steve Carell as you've never seen him before, has some disquieting qualities. I can't avoid thinking that if the characters in this movie, and men in general, had been more articulate about their feelings, a tragedy could have been avoided, but that is irrelevant. The ending of this movie, based on a true story, was in the headlines some years back. If you don't remember what happened, I won't spoil it for you."
"LouisGur","9","60","104","9 November 2014"," A different look at wrestling, in a good way!
","My first night at the Stockholm Film Festival turned out really great thanks to Foxcatcher. A movie I didn't expect much from, but it was in fact one of the best movies of 2014. Foxcatcher is a movie that doesn't have that much action and will surely disappoint those who loves wrestling and wants to see fights. This is not a movie about the good side of the sport, it's about the bad one we don't get to see when Hulk Mania and The Rock performs nowadays.<br/><br/>The film is based upon a true story. Mark Schultz is an Olympic wrestler. His relationship with his sponsor, John du Pont and his older brother leads to very unlikely circumstances between both. John du Pont turns out to be a bit different than the man he first seemed like.<br/><br/>What I first wondered when I read about the film was, ""how could they pick Channing Tatum for such a dramatic role? Isn't he that guy who just shows off his abs so the girls can look at something?"" Well, in this movie Channing was someone completely different. He is superb as Mark Schultz, I couldn't imagine anyone else playing him after seeing this film. And this is partly what makes the film very watchable and good. Steve Carell (who usually stars in sex comedies) also did an amazing job as John du Pont. I could barely recognize him at first, and forgot that it was him 10 minutes after he first appeared on the screen. In the end, I also forgot what he looks like in real life. Great job on the make up there!<br/><br/>The good performances is definitely what I enjoyed the most. I'm not into wrestling, and Foxcatcher didn't really make me interested. It's a very deterrent example of how some Olympic athletes are trained and treated when they're not on TV. The movie will be out in theaters later this month, and I suggest you to go watch it. If you're not a fan of wrestling, that's even better. I don't like the sport but loved this movie.<br/><br/>However, pick your theater carefully. Sadly, some people in front of me waited to see Channing Tatum naked during the beginning. They were just annoying, but quiet when they realized that they weren't watching a teen comedy. Which was, around thirty minutes into the film. So I didn't really mind! The movie is a bit over two hours long..."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","50","88","26 October 2014"," A meticulously crafted if dry study of the American dream.
","It's been a long wait. After a year and a half of hype, Foxcatcher is  finally among us. This isn't really the type of film that earns such  excitement. It's a cold, hard, slow burn, but one that's meticulously  crafted. It's a film easier to appreciate than to enjoy. It tells the  true story of the relationship between Olympic gold medalist Mark  Schultz, played by Channing Tatum, his brother and also gold medalist  David, played by Mark Ruffalo, and a wealthy entrepreneur investing in  their future to become World Champions, Jan Du Pont, played by Steve  Carell. For a story of such tragedy and exposure to the world at large,  it's surprising that we're only hearing of it now, but the film's weak  spots do make it clear why director Bennett Miller needed an extra year  to work on it, having been initially anticipated as a 2013 release.   It's clear from the style of Capote and Moneyball that Miller is  concerned with capturing raw authenticity with a voyeuristic (and  grimly saturated) eye on the characters. It gives Tatum and Carell some  of the best artistic environments of their careers for them to play  around in. Tatum in particular is impressive unlike what we've seen him  in before. In his previous films he's seemed so disengaged but here he  has tunnel vision focus, constantly fighting imaginary foes. We're  often given shots of him just staring out windows, but he makes them  rich with subtext, with both his fulfillment of his ambitions and  tedium of his stripped down life. It's a physical role with great  sensitivity, showing his selfishness and self-deprecating side.   Although there's a strong bond between the brothers especially with  their sport, Ruffalo is the antithesis of Tatum. Where Tatum still  seems to struggle when engaging with people, however appropriate for  the character, it all comes natural for Ruffalo. It's a very subdued  but loose performance. Internalizing a lot of different emotions,  frustrations and conflicts that Tatum and Carell have but with a whole  heap of charm. He's comfortable in his own skin compared to them. I  missed him when he wasn't on screen, but it's unfortunate that during  his portion of the film in the last third, events become too jumbled.  Especially in its final twenty minutes, which does unfortunately drag  the film down for me that it doesn't land on two feet. It does find key  moments bubbling under its psychological tension, and you often have to  be very patient for them to reveal themselves.   Carell however was a slight disappointment. The most hyped up aspect of  the film since we first got excited 18 months ago, it's certainly  transformative but the character is too sparse and distant. Granted,  this is part of Du Pont, he's a man who doesn't make have a presence  when he walks into a room so he has to compensate with money and  weapons. He's good, but suffers due to this nature. His character  blossoms under Miller's direction and the makeup (his nose looking like  the 'eagle' he wants himself nicknamed after), but his strength in his  prolonged sinister stares. The film has some very interesting themes to  say with him about the American dream and patriotism, ironic as his  last name is evidently foreign. It's quietly powerful. Carell is best  as a fascinating contradictory poetic figure, rather than a  performance.   It's a great film thanks to Miller's methodical approach in setting up  the triangle of characters, and the anguish of their motivations. It is  cripplingly restrained in every facet, which is good to express the  repression that the characters go through; the joylessness of Mark's  success, how David's family weigh him down, the way people  underestimate Du Pont, and then the ultimate dissatisfaction of the  glory they chase. There's a lot to delight from its allegories and the  way the relationships develop. However, the way it puts the viewer at  an unsettling distance and how dry and somber it is hints that it might  not do too well at winning awards, though certainly show up on ballots.  I'm sensing that we may find a Carell snub in a stacked category, but  Ruffalo is assured. Miller may have to fight for that 5th spot in  Director but I wouldn't be surprised to see him there. I'm not eager to  watch Foxcatcher again so soon but it's a film that burrows deeply in  fraught places.   8/10"

"StevePulaski","8","32","55","27 December 2014"," A profoundly affecting film, as low-key as it manages to be
","Bennett Miller's ""Foxcatcher"" opens along the lines of a mumblecore film, with little dialog and brief sequences establishing the ho-hum routine of somebody we would think would live a more intriguing and layered life. For the film's first fifteen minutes, we follow the routine of Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an Olympic gold-medalist in wrestling who is now wading in the water for something to either come to him or him to find something to go to. These are a profound fifteen minutes, low-key and substantive in the regard that even somebody we fable and could possibly model ourselves after still goes through the checklist of ordinary things in his daily life: eating alone at a small, fold-up table in his apartment, eating fast food in his car, practicing at your average wrestling gym, and so forth. During these fifteen minutes, dialog is rare and we are captivated by the ambiance of Mark's surroundings and the bleak way Miller and cinematographer Greig Fraser (cinematographer for ""Zero Dark Thirty"") capture his environment.<br/><br/>One day, Mark is contacted by a representative for John Eleuthère du Pont, a multimillionaire philanthropist who wants to meet with him at once. Mark travels to du Pont's lavish home, where he informs him of his patriotism and his love for the sport of wrestling, and offers to coach Mark for his wrestling team known as ""Foxcatcher,"" where they would travel and compete in wrestling tournaments all around the world. Mark contacts his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), who has settled down with a wife and kids and, while he doesn't want to drop everything to join a wrestling team, supports his brother, for he sees that his brother's life has become a drudgery of existing rather than living. Mark accepts du Pont's offer and travels out to work under his grueling, yet motivating practices to hopefully become ""the greatest wrestler in the world,"" a title that Mark has long-desired.<br/><br/>John du Pont is played by Steve Carell in one of his most fascinating and bizarre roles to date. Carell is buried under a plethora of facial prosthetics, giving his face a fatter, aged look to it, with gray, scaley-skin, thinning hair, little to no eyebrows, and a large, protruding nose. While, at first, you're distracted by Carell's getup, he overcomes one of the toughest hurdles in his acting career, which is getting you to look past the heavy use of makeup and manipulation to look at the character instead. Carell has always been an intriguing character actor to watch, taking comedy and drama roles, weaving in and out of them beautifully, like a younger Robin Williams. Here, he gives a haunting and unpredictable performance of a character that never seems fully relaxed and never quite stable.<br/><br/>Tatum and Ruffalo both shine in their respective roles as well, especially Tatum, who finally has found a role that allows him to show off his brawn as well as his ability to act and maintain an on-screen composure. Tatum has been one of my favorite leading males for years, and anytime somebody criticizes him of being an actor who's sole purpose is eye-candy needs to watch this film and eat their words. Tatum gives a visceral performance here, and one almost as haunting as Carell's, but in a different way. Tatum's performance is rooted more in ritualistic behaviors, including displays of uncontrollable anger when certain things do not work out, like when he's considerably overweight for a particular match. Frequently, Tatum's character engages in self-mutilation by punching and thrusting himself into a mirror, which turns out to be much more frightening then it sounds.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is a terrific adult drama because it's so rare to see a film so low-key in its themes and its display of events, yet so effective in delivering a wild true story with all the punch it needs. Its only real misstep is how little we know about du Pont's deteriorating mental state at the end, and because of that, the ending comes out of nowhere, as if Miller and writers E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman didn't offer enough development or foreshadowing as to something like what occurred was about to take place. Furthermore, du Pont's character is sort of left as an enigma throughout the whole film, which may have been what he was like in real life to the brothers Schultz, but it becomes a bit of a contradiction, as the film tries to humanize the Schultz's yet leave du Pont cast in shadow.<br/><br/>However, this small feature still doesn't obscure the fact that ""Foxcatcher"" is one of the strongest adult dramas of the year, and has a collection of some of the year's finest performances all in one film."
"hughman55","10","11","16","10 February 2015"," How much for your soul?
","This film fires on all pistons.  Skillfully directed with an economically written screenplay it is made real before your eyes by a cast of unparalleled performances. This film is as near perfection as you can get.<br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliant beyond words because it is beyond words.  In the case of this film, the economy of words, and the power of silence, speaks volumes.  And that silence, in the hands of a director and a cast like this, roils like volcanic magma.  ""Foxcatcher"" is the true story of two brothers, Mark and David Schultz, who become entangled in the dysfunctional mother/son relationship of Jean and John du Pont.        <br/><br/>Steve Carell plays John, a multimillionaire loner who's family's money is so old it smells.  He wisely piled on about a pound of makeup and prosthetics to the point where he is unrecognizable as the lovable goofball from ""40 Year Old Virgin"".  He then delivers one of the creepiest and most menacing performances ever recorded on film, and it would never have been as effective if he had been in the clown suit he's been wearing for the last 15 years.  Vanessa Redgrave as Jean, with only about three minutes of screen time, manages to buttress her son's weirdness with her own.  They are each the byproducts of too much money, isolation, and total disconnection from consequences. They dislike one another and they dislike one another's obsessions: hers, expensive horses, his, male Olympic wrestlers.  The estate they share has a world-class stable of Thoroughbreds presided over by Jean, and a world-class training center for wrestling presided over by du Pont.  It is from these two fortresses that they war with one another.  They are each, the only people in their respective lives, who spends any time with them that isn't paid to do so. And it is into to this toxic tar pit that the Schultz brothers are lured.  <br/><br/>In 1987, the Schultz brothers are Olympic gold medalists in wrestling. Post Olympic glory, they are living a very modest, if not meager, life training in a run down gym for the Seoul games.  The film opens with the two in a sparring practice with one another.  Their moves have been studied and repeated a thousand times before and, but for a mostly disregarded bloody nose, rudimentary. This is their war, their sibling rivalry, but tamed by rules.  Nonetheless, it is a conflict that reaches beyond the boundaries of their sport.   Out of nowhere this daily grind is interrupted by mulit-millionaire wrestling ""enthusiast"" John du Pont. He makes the younger Schultz, Mark, an offer of $25,000.00 to come to his personal training center. The trade off is to acknowledge him as his coach.  Du Pont, outfitted in coaching attire, walks imperiously around the gym, nodding and barking orders at his ""stable"" of wrestlers, without a clue to what he is doing.  He knows nothing about wrestling but is well practiced at grooming those around him with money and access to his privilege.  Over time, though, Mark becomes unmanageable and equally uncomfortable with du Pont's demands which are only vaguely alluded to.  Du Pont then purchases the previously unaffordable David Schultz to straighten out Mark.  It is a deal with the devil.  <br/><br/>The startling pivot in this film creeps up out of nowhere when David is asked to participate in a documentary and praise du Pont's coaching.  Take after take, with the film director prodding him, he is unable to say into the camera with any discernible sincerity, that he admire's du Pont's coaching ability.  The footage is rendered useless but it is not forgotten.  The tension between du Pont, Dave, and the younger brother Mark, who has Olympic weight on his shoulders, becomes unsustainable as the egos, dysfunction, and expectations, begin devouring the possibilities.  The results will leave no winners on or off the wrestling mat.  <br/><br/>Art Director, Brad Ricker, has washed the imagery of this film in grey; the color of decay, dust, and inertia.  The pace of the film is deliberately - not fast. The silence, so skillfully directed and acted, is deafening.  Carell, Ruffalo, Redgrave, and Channing give Oscar worthy performances.<br/><br/>The mixture of money, glory, dysfunction, ego, and the Olympic ideal, all come together here to create a compelling and disturbing picture of real life events. The snowball affect of one decision, leading to another, and another, until - well, bang, is unfurled with foreboding and deliberateness. This is a film that you can feel. It's not a good feeling, and you feel as though you are there. Not being nominated for Best Picture is unbelievable. But Oscar really only reflects achievement at about a rate of 50/50. This film will suffer the curse of being a great film about a bad thing. But it is a great film and well worth seeing. They'll get my ticket money twice."
"jabarker81","10","3","3","18 March 2019"," Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffalo at the peak of their careers
","When you see Steve Carell in a movie, you expect him to be the funniest thing in a movie. When you see Channing Tatum, you expect him to be buff, and be the hot hero of the movie. When you see Mark Ruffalo, you expect to see comedy-drama movies, and he's just a side character. With Foxcatcher, you see none of those. Instead, you see a very ominous picture. The musical score is scarcely used, which makes it even better. The best part of the picture, no doubt, is Steve Carell as John E. DuPont. Holy Hell! He was frightening just to look at. And him talking without yelling is actually what sells it. Channing Tatum was absolutely phenomenal as Mark Schultz. Not only did he nail the role perfectly, he took it to the next level, and actually managed to even stay in character even when he injured himself with the mirror. Mark Ruffalo was rather quiet as Dave Schultz, but even then, it's necessary for the character development. Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is an underrated gem that people overlooked. With a sports movie, you get to know the players of the team, you have them lose first, but along the way they win the games, and eventually come closer as a team and family. With Foxcatcher, none of that happens. Instead, you get a chronological series of events, and Steve Carell being rather reclusive toward his team, and his mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave. It doesn't have you watching, and enjoying it. It has you watching a reality with actors, who are usually cast in stereotypical roles, breaking that streak, and having the people they're playing come out instead of them. This movie easily made it to my top 20 list."
"philipversfeld","1","92","182","9 January 2015"," What the Fox say? ""Catch another movie - avoid this one""
","Foxcatcher... a limp train wreck of a film, driven only by the tragedy of the true story on which it's based, and no doubt geared to be hot at the Oscars thanks to huge departures from typecasting for both Carrell & Tatum. <br/><br/>""Accuracy of events and characterizations be damned - we're making an art movie here!"" <br/><br/>Let's summarize, shall we? Forrest Gump and his bearded brother, Quasimodo, both won wrestling gold in the 84 Olympics. Their relationship is somewhat strained, as Forrest feels second best. 1987, we see Forrest poor and down on his luck, when mentally disturbed narcissist, billionaire & self-appointed ace wrestling coach, Montgomery Burns, invites Forrest over to his elaborate estate to wrestle for him and assist in coaching his team in exchange for boarding and big money. Forrest wins gold at the 87 World championships, and fosters a twisted father/son relationship with Mr Burns. <br/><br/>Much homo-erotic bonding, drinking and drug use later, Mr Burns loses his marbles, humiliates Forrest (who is now addicted to booze and cocaine), and instead brings in Quasimodo as assistant coach, reducing Forrest to wrestler status. Forrest cracks under the pressure, and sucks at the 88 Olympics. Mr Burns grows envious of Quasimodo's coaching prowess and success, as well as his efforts to protect Forrest, regardless of poor performance. Forrest gets the boot & takes up cage fighting, while Quasimodo stays behind and eventually gets murdered by a slow-burning, envious Mr Burns.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum plays Mark Schulz, aka Forrest Gump - minus the good humor and sunny disposition... instead replaced by an overly-accentuated ape-walk and a constantly protruding forced under-bite that obviously made it hard to speak. A shame that he had to be portrayed in a mentally challenged, quasi-autistic fashion, when the actual Mark Schulz is in fact a personable guy that had a 3.6 GPA in high school.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo is Dave Schulz, aka Quasimodo - having packed on a few pounds of muscle and managing to look exactly like David Cross, our tragic hero is always hunched over and bow-legged, in a morning-after-Brokeback-Mountain kind of way.<br/><br/>And finally, funny man Steve Carrell... John DuPont - who is portrayed as Mr Burns with a speech impediment, an unhealthy love for guns, and a thousand-yard-stare borne of the constant clamoring for his aristocratic mother's affections & approval. His over-accentuated giant nose sadly changes size and shape several times throughout the film.<br/><br/>Everyone else is just a face - added like an afterthought, with no real interactions or discussions with the main characters.<br/><br/>It's got the whole ""Faustian retelling, filled with belated guilted patriotism for a fallen American sports champion"" vibe about it - throw in some men grappling, oddly shot scenes, men hugging, incredibly slow dialog, men slapping each other's backs and shoulders and a score filled with loads of melancholic piano during dramatic shots, and it's easy to see how it was so loved by the Cannes crowd...<br/><br/>Personally though, I wanted to gouge out my eyes halfway through - the film could have been around 40 minutes shorter were it not for the dramatic artsy landscape / filmed through a window / mundane happenings scenes and the frustratingly slow dialog.<br/><br/>The most entertaining bit during the entire 2-hour ordeal, was having a chuckle at the snoring of the guy sitting behind me.<br/><br/>I went in expecting an epic sports drama of Warrior proportions, and left depressed, wondering where it all went wrong.<br/><br/>Avoid this film like the plague."

","This movie is a complete disappointment. I was so excited to see it after watching the trailers and knowing that Steve Carell was in it, I think he has great potential as a dramatic actor. The movie has a lot of awkward scenes and doesn't give you any back story into the characters. There's a lot of things that don't make sense and that are never explained. At the end of the movie they don't even tell you what Mark's reaction to his brother's death was or the sentence that du Pont got. I didn't even think the acting was that spectacular. Channing Tatum literally acts like an ape and Steve Carell is just creepy and uncomfortable. One of the worst movies I've seen."

","Bennett Miller's newest biopic, Foxcatcher, creates quite a disturbing picture for one of America's wealthiest and most powerful families. The film is based on the autobiography of Olympic Wrestling Champion Mark Schultz where he details his training leading up to the 1988 Olympics.<br/><br/>John Du Pont decides he wants to coach the men's Olympic Wrestling team. What are his qualifications you are asking yourself in the meantime? None. He has no qualifications. He simply is a rich schizophrenic man who lives at home with his mother and has a very strange affection toward men's wrestling and especially Mark Schultz. The film provides a dark tone and setting for the entirety of the film offering no alternative. The story is dark and Miller makes sure you know that.<br/><br/>The film is based on real events so it is not a spoiler to tell you that Du Pont's schizophrenia leads to a murder resulting him in jail where he resided until his death in 2010. His obsession with Mark and his brother Dave Schultz, another Olympic gold medalist, becomes the center of the plot in this spine tingling tale.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is going to get an Oscar nomination for this. He has finally proved to audiences that he can undertake and perfect dramatic acting. There is not one specific scene in the film that showcases this talent rather his performance as a whole. He is John Du Pont. They plaster on him a fake nose, make him look much older, and voilà you have Steve Carell looking like Du Pont. Next, he masterfully had to act like Du Pont. His struggle to prove to his mother he can do something and his sickening obsession with Mark and Dave give us that eerie feeling he is up to no good. Steve Carell freaked me out in this film. If it were up to me, I would absolutely give him a nomination and probably the Oscar.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum gives the biggest and best breakthrough performance I have ever seen. This role is not like any others for Tatum. He plays Mark Schultz, the younger of the two brothers. Tatum perfects Schultz's nervous habits allowing the audience to see the insecurity in Schultz's mind. He is a loner, seemingly sexually confused, and very much insecure about his own wrestling ability despite being an Olympic Champion. Channing Tatum is magnificent. I pray he receives an Oscar nomination as well.<br/><br/>It is so refreshing to see actors who have never really branched out before finally show us what they got. Tatum branched out with Foxcatcher and he showed us he has what it takes to be a serious actor and potential Oscar nominee in the future.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller won the Best Director prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival and I must confess I admire his directing so much. Foxcatcher is a very well made film and is created quite tastefully. There are several scenes that allude to Du Pont's homosexuality with his complete infatuation with Mark towards the beginning. It even implies Mark allowed this to evolve into something. Whatever it is, Miller does an excellent job conveying the creepiness of it all. His previous filmography includes Capote (2005) and Moneyball (2011). Obviously Miller enjoys creating stories centered on real people and events.<br/><br/>This film is not lighthearted and happy. It is dark and it is mysterious. Miller keeps us in a sort of shrouded mist throughout the film. It is very ambiguous at times but this ambiguity does not inhibit the film at all. This was one of the best films I saw at Cannes this year and I believe it's going to rack up a lot of Oscar nominations this awards season."

","The do-over for Steve Carrell is exactly how Frankenstein would end up if a make-up artist wanted to make him look human, and likewise Tatum Channing <=> Igor.<br/><br/>And if for some reason Frankenstein and Igor HAD to go plodding into a drama, then this movie would be the hilariously boring result. Mark Ruffalo's character did remind me of a bearded Wreck-it-Ralph, but at least there wasn't any weird prosthetics or forced facial movements.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell's immovable poorly done pasty-coloured forehead and Tatum's forced protrusion of the lower mandible  coupled with their very awkward posturing and walking movements (probably thanks to over enthusiastic 'theatrics' coaches) plus minced marbles-in-my-mouth dialogue, are all constant distractions . even unintended entertainment  which soon drags on and on in this uninspired movie.<br/><br/>The real John du Pont and Mark Schultz have vastly different facial looks from the forced caricatures of what you find in this movie. Since the faces of both real men are hardly well-known, the actors should have been allowed to have their natural faces  and that's where the talent of each (if they had one) would be allowed to shine. And yes, the real John du Pont's forehead did move and his face did look like a proper living person, and the real Mark Schultz was not a protruding-jaw klutz. So why the odd prosthetics and make up here??<br/><br/>I am all for slow movies with panning scenes in a slow-burn drama  when it allows you to get immersed in the entire experience, but here in Foxcatcher the snail and tortoise races to be the slowest in a totally insipid and inane who-cares frame-by-frame.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I read up on the real back-end story, and it is in fact more interesting reading about it then watching this extremely forced and unnecessarily stretched out and poorly executed 'dramatization' of events.<br/><br/>It is like watching our three actors starting out on their idiocy SNL routine  and then the audience having to wait for the punchline that never came even after over 2 hours!<br/><br/>Should have watched SNL instead :("

","I registered with IMDb just to write a review of this movie because it's so bad that I feel I have to warn people about it before they watch it. Just like Birdman, it's another 2014 Oscar nominated movie that is boring as hell and I keep wondering how it got so many good critic reviews and awards.<br/><br/>First of all, like many ""Based on a true story"" movies, most of it is factually wrong, like the Schultz brothers living at Foxcatcher at the same time, which never actually happened. The disclaimer should read ""Loosely based on a true story"".<br/><br/>But what irks me the most is that the true story is actually fascinating, in fact if you google John du Pont you will find lots of details on the life of this deranged lunatic. However, director Bennett Miller chooses to focus on just a small portion of du Pont's personality, mostly his arrogance and giant ego. As such, the movie ends up being over two hours of coma-inducing storytelling and visuals.<br/><br/>Miller had a large amount of elements in the real story to make this a really good three hour movie if he wanted. John du Pont was a fascinating lunatic, cokehead, drunk, you name it. He would drive a tank around his estate. On two different occasions, he drove his car into a pond. He thought he was the Dalai Lama. He tried to kill his wife. He had treadmills removed from his gym because he thought they were taking him back in time. And if you do some research on this lunatic you find lots of stories like this. Then why would Miller not use them, instead making this awfully boring movie? I just don't get it.<br/><br/>Save your money and time, this movie is just not worth it."

"brchthethird","8","7","10","6 April 2015"," Slow-burning, cerebral character study - not for those with a short attention span
","FOXCATCHER is a film that is easier to admire than to love, and I mean that in the best way possible. While the slow and deliberate pacing will put a lot of people off, its disturbing subject matter, psychological depth and outstanding performances make it fascinating, if not riveting. For those unaware of what the story is about (like I was), the film mostly revolves around Mark and David Schultz, two Olympic gold medal-winning wrestlers who become involved with eccentric millionaire (billionaire?) John Du Pont, specifically in preparation for the 1988 World Championship and Seoul Olympics. But wrestling is just the conduit for a deep character study of people who looked to overcome personal weakness by achieving greatness. It's really hard to say who gives the best performance out of the three leads because all of them do so well. Mark Ruffalo (who plays Dave Schultz) usually does well, and this is no exception. Steve Carell was barely recognizable as the eccentric Du Pont, greatly aided by prosthetics in his physical transformation, but also quite different in the way he spoke and carried himself compared with what roles he usually plays. I suppose the biggest surprise of them all is Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schultz) who manages to hold his own against these other two acting greats. Although he didn't have a whole lot of dialogue (and really, the film as a whole doesn't), the physicality he brought to the role was incredible in its own right. As for the wrestling scenes, they were shot well, if unspectacular. Basically they did what they needed to do for the narrative, i.e., serve as guideposts so that one didn't get lost in the pacing (and also because they were factual). What interested me the most, though, was the curious relationship that develops between John Du Pont and Mark Schultz. Du Pont takes Mark under his wing, provides him with living quarters, a training facility, and pays him, yet his status as the team coach (and quite a rich one at that) makes it where the relationship is rather one-sided. In real life, John Du Pont was the black sheep of his family and a very lonely man, and taking on Mark Schultz was a way for him to indulge in his interests and to have a friend. Now, as interesting as I find true crime, there usually has to be some stylistic choice or a scene or two which get to me in an emotional way, and this film has that as well. Both of these scenes are dialogue-free and are scored using Arvo Part's ""Fur Alina,"" a hauntingly minimal piano piece which I recently discovered. To me, these scenes (which I won't spoil) perfectly capture the film's melancholy tone. And in general, the score is rather tasteful. Often, the sound design will completely take a back seat and certain scenes will play out free of dialogue with a sort of humming that brings a subtle intensity and a growing sense of dread. Overall, FOXCATCHER is an excellent, dark character study that features some great performances and an ending that will shock you even if you see it coming. Highly recommended, as long you have a good attention span."

Steve Carrell does a surprisingly superb job of capturing Du Pont while Tatum is weak as usual and Ruffalo shines. I find it incredible that I completely missed this story in the news and was wildly surprised as the movie unfolded. Nicely done, though I may be leaning toward the surprising true story and not the actual film. Regarding the film, however, a much better job could be done in representing the passage of time. On the positive side, the film captured the environment and circumstances in which these events took place and let us ""feel"" the motivations of the players."
"aharmas","10","12","22","24 November 2014"," What a Heavy Load These Demons Can Be
","Bennett Miller's previous attempt at a bio picture resulted in at best a frustrating outcome. I could never see past the miscasting of Hoffman in the lead role. You couldn't stop seeing his commendable attempts at capturing the soul of the writer, but it didn't come near the wonderful portrayal by Jones in ""Infamous"". Miller has done an impeccable job getting his three leads to capture the essence of the two brothers and the man who came in between them, tried to buy, steal, or use their talents in order to fulfill a deep and desperate craving for recognition, love, and respect.<br/><br/>There are details that can probably enlighten us more about what was in the background of a man as mixed up as John du Pont. In my opinion, Carrell's portrayal makes it as real as possible. We can read the yearning for acceptance in his eyes, and his psychological baggage comes across in his facial expression shows loneliness, sadness, anger, frustration, and so much more. There is close attention to detail in the way each one of these characters move and walk, a simplicity in the way David and Mark move about. One wonders about how much Mark is capable of understanding about what is happening to and around him. He allows people in, responding to basic offering of love and support from his brother and John. Of course, each of these men have different motivations, and Mark eventually experiences confusion because he can't at times realize what is happening to him.<br/><br/>Du Pont needs some talented athletes/wrestlers who can help him get a gold medal to show his mother and the world he's able to achieve something ""on his own"". We all know he's learned from his mother to buy whatever he wants, and his response when he doesn't get it is not much different from a spoiled boy. That is what makes the resolution inevitable and very scary because we have seen it all before. There are going to be some tantrum episodes, and money can truly make them grow exponentially.<br/><br/>We see how du Pont reaches out to Mark, seduces him into believing he's got love and support, but he is unable to provide the same quality that his brother has been giving him for years. At this moment no one really understands what is going on, but we see there's a level of attraction between John and Mark. Is this physical? Is this a father/son bond? Is John just using Mark? When things don't go as expected, David is summoned, but there's no more trust between John and Mark, and Mark's professional future might be compromised. This will result in a negative outcome for all those involved because Mark, John, and David might never get what they really want.<br/><br/>There is a strong sense of doom and sadness permeating the narrative. Even the smiles and happy moments feel threatened by the darkness in John's world. What is remarkable is how well Carrell captures this man and all the ugliness that is part of his life, and how this becomes toxic to all of those involved. Vanessa Redgrave, who is one superb actress comes in a few key scenes and shows the magnitude of her influence on her son. He makes a reference to her manipulations in his early years to satisfy his basic needs, and with a couple of looks she gives him, we know that there is no way he will be ever be or get what he wants or needs in his life. She just won't allow it because she's just never going to accept him for what he is.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is dark and powerful, real and involving because it shows three individuals who happen to share the same environment and somehow have a very difficult time connecting. In the perfect world, they should be able to reach for the stars, but the real world is not perfect, and they all succumb to the forces of the hell that surrounds them."

","FOXCATCHER (2014) *** Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Sienna Miller, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Michael Hall. Absorbing fact-based drama about Olympic-driven wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum) who finds himself invited to be sponsored for the 1988 Olympics by eccentric (to say the least) millionaire John E. du Pont (Carell, buried under puttified make-up and prosthetic nose and teeth, giving one creepazoid yet genuinely great performance) whose bizarre status building dreams overshadow the dark underpinnings of male bonding, self-privileged allusions and ultimately paranoia. While the pacing by director Bennett Miller is at times teeth-grindingly dull (with practically zero soundtrack and dead spots of unease silence to a fault) the well-structured script by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman is spot-on with how one's perceptions tend to overshadow one's reality (i.e. 'the American Dream'). Ruffalo gives a quietly dignified supporting turn as Mark's older brother David whose weariness in duPont's Macchiavelean ego foreshadows its tragic final act all too well."
"blazesuncaster","8","2","2","13 April 2020"," Very late review I know
","I'm making this review 6 years after the release of the film because, I have seen it 2 times in the past but don't think I firmly grasp the meaning of the movie. Now I'm 18 and know that the film is about arrogance, selfishness, and mostly conceited ness. This whole film is about family and who do you trust, your angels or your demons. Each character has there own important story. Mark is a Olympic gold medalist and wants to become that worlds greatest wrestler, Dave is also a Olympic gold medalist and has a wife and children and isn't focused just in wrestling, and John du Pont is a selfish greedy man who grew up living with a weight on his back and the weight on his back are ""the horses."" His mom loved horses and hated the idea of wrestling. It's a very slow burning movie, definitely on the back burner, but it gives a message to the audience that ""you never really know people"" and also ""money doesn't solve things"" it's not the money, it's the people. Brilliantly acted by Steve Carrell and Mark Ruffalo. The story was really awesome and I'm glad I got to review it."

","Anybody who is not aware of the star cast may make a failed guess about the actor who played John du Pont. It is one of a performance by Steve Carell. Steve have nailed it in so many ways. The makeup was superb. The bizzare dialogue delivery was well acted. Not only Steve's, but Channing and Mark's characters were given thoughtful makeup, for example the Cauliflower Ears common in wrestlers. The expecting though unexpected climax stole the other interesting parts of the story. I am impressed by the director, Bennett Miller.

"bob-the-movie-man","8","10","18","24 January 2015"," A movie that throws you on your back and holds you down
","Every comedian clearly has a burning desire to be seen as a ""serious actor"" at least once in their career: Jim Carrey had his ""Truman Show""; Steve Coogan wrote himself into ""Philomena""; and (whilst he has denied that he is desperate for this sort of attention) Foxcatcher is Steve Carrell's turn. and boy does he do a good job.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is not a feel-good sort of movie. It is made all the more harrowing when you realise that it is based on a true story.<br/><br/>Carrell stars as John DuPont, heir of the enormously wealthy DuPont family, who made their fortune in chemicals and CFCs. Growing up in a cossetted environment on the family's Foxcatcher ranch, under the guidance of his manipulative and controlling mother (Vanessa Redgrave), DuPont strives to find ways to impress the elderly matriarch. Vanessa Redgrave in fine form as the DuPont matriarch.<br/><br/>His latest attempt is to act as Olympic coach to the US wrestling team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. To this end he throws money at the problem 'recruiting' the gold-medal winning Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and trying to recruit his family-man brother and fellow gold-winner David (Mark Ruffalo). But the road to Olympic glory in this case is not easy, and the relationship between the driven but self-doubting Mark and the erratic and eccentric DuPont becomes progressively more strained. <br/><br/>We have seen two films in recent months that portrayed bullying justified by the goal of achieving excellence in performance: JK Thompson's portrayal in ""Whiplash"" did it through old-fashioned shouting, demeaning comments and violence; Carell's DuPont delivers it in a much darker and more odious way, eroding the souls of his victims through the vicious application of his power and position. In this sense, you could effectively position the character of John DuPont as one of cinema's greatest villains.<br/><br/>Carrell's performance is excellent and his Oscar-nomination (albeit as a bit of an outsider behind Keaton and Redmayne) is well-deserved. It is a startling deviation from his previous screen persona, and (looking at archive video footage of Dupont) it is also a remarkably good impersonation of his mannerisms and delivery. <br/><br/>The quality of the lead though shouldn't take away from the supporting acting of both Tatum, who gives a career-best performance as the brooding and increasingly disillusioned protégé, and of Ruffalo in the quieter and more nuanced role of his brother. Only Ruffalo has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, which seems something of a shame. However, the latter's performance in a video ""tribute"" to Dupont is toe-curlingly embarrassing. In fact, a number of the scenes in this film fall into that category reaching its zenith in a seat-squirming demonstration of Dupont's coaching skills in front of the unimpressed Redgrave.<br/><br/>Oscar-nominated direction is by Bennett Miller, best known for another well regarded 'sports' film ""Moneyball"" and the earlier ""Capote"" which was also Oscar nominated for direction. The tight and effective writing is by E. Max Fry and ""Capote"" writer Dan Futerman, and one of the impressive things about this screenplay is that it never completely fills in all of the blanks in the relationship between Mark Schulz and DuPont: some of the scenes are left deliberately vague (notably in the night-time 'training session' scene).<br/><br/>Whilst not being much into 'sports films' of the baseball/boxing variety, the film positions the wrestling as something of a side-line to the emotional drama. You should certainly not be put off from seeing this film because of that. It comes with my recommendation.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see past reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email on the site to receive future posts)."
"donaghms","5","15","30","1 December 2014"," Not as good as it should have been
","Some lovely cinematography. Tatum and Ruffalo were quite impressive in both their characterisations and their ability to show themselves as wrestlers. For me the weak point was Steve Carell - whom I greatly respect as a serious actor. I could never get past the fact that it was Steve Carell with a cartoonishly large nose. In some scenes it appeared he was doing a Don Corleone impression. Vanessa Redgrave and Sienna Miller were grossly under utilised. Neither having more than a handful of lines. whilst I recognise that this story is based on real events, not much happened. It was a very slow paced film that had me checking the time and wondering 'when will they get to the murder?' Du Pont locked himself away in his mansion for two days following the murder while the police attempted to negotiate with him. That was not shown."
"FilmMuscle","10","8","14","18 January 2015"," The Battle of Ego, Power, and Wealth
","After the gripping character studies and intelligent social commentaries that Bennett Miller has become such a master of, there's no better filmmaker to tackle this shocking true story—a tragedy about people who ambitiously chased the American Dream and actually fell for its seduction. Coming off of a championship win, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is near the top of Olympic wrestling but lacks the proper wit, ambition, and strategy to further himself until he is fatefully invited to meet John du Pont (Steve Carell), a member of the most famous and wealthy dynasty in the country, who instills him with athletic fury, drive, and infectious motivational philosophy. Mark truly wants to be the best in the world, but his lacking astuteness has now led him away from his fatherly and encouraging brother, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo)—a respected coach and wrestler who Mark enviously realizes is a whole level above him—and into the psychologically unpredictable hands of a creepily uncanny, eccentric stranger who he admittedly hasn't even heard of. <br/><br/>With the help of absolutely convincing make-up that shapes the noticeably wicked/large nose and eerie teeth, Carell delivers a powerfully haunting performance as a socially isolated and awkward man, raised in an out-of-touch environment all his life, who is struggling with numerous egoistic and trust issues that endlessly vex him from within. However, this is also Tatum's show as we follow the rise of this naïve meathead (how can I more politely describe him?) who is clearly vulnerable to being essentially puppeteered by exploitive, power-hungry men. It's worth to point out just how Tatum's childlike, innocent personality here infuses us with total pity for his character while Ruffalo's usual warmth makes us sympathize as well. In fact, Ruffalo's performance is most subtle of all; he's obviously not as flamboyant as the other two and is instead relied on to reflect a certain human quality in an otherwise utterly cold picture. Dave Schultz is a big brother who's undoubtedly talented in the sport, but unlike the other two, his pride doesn't get the better of him since he continually seeks to improve his brother on that path to fame and success as well. <br/><br/>Here is where it gets worryingly complicated though because these three personalities develop a paranoid, unreliable dynamic that sees each other vie for that ultimate glory. Foxcatcher thoroughly utilizes the sport of wrestling as not only a point of critique but also as a stark metaphor for this dangerous power struggle between complex individuals behind the scenes. There's no better feeling than being called a winner—being recognized as a man who achieved tremendous victory and success. The fierce competitiveness and the frequent sense of disappointing failure that is so inherent in the very essence of sports has produced an abundance of psychologically and ideologically conflicted, twisted men that are battling with intolerable arrogance and blindness. In the case of John du Pont, the feeling of invalidation and complete disrespect beleaguers him through his days, including the sharp disapproval from his own mother (Vanessa Redgrave) who only views wrestling—her son's sole passion—as a lowly sport. As he witnesses the admiration people express towards the actually capable coaches like Dave and the brawny athletes like Mark, he's sort of put in between—in a position where people recognize him as that one lucky, wealthy son of a gun but nothing more. <br/><br/>Through the use of deliberately-timed editing, the constant grapple of jealousy—the lingering sense of betrayal; the sense of unrelenting determination to shine above the others and escape each other's shadows —between these three is realized. The film also paces itself so slowly with countless scenes of dead silence and the absence of a score that would've just easily manipulated our impressions of the people on- screen. It's almost as if Foxcatcher intends to remain as cold and distant from its subjects as possible. Perhaps—gasp—it means to take a more objective perspective of its protagonists (unlike most biopics in recent memory) and allow the final consequences to make its ultimate point. <br/><br/>From scene to scene, we witness the amusing awkwardness of du Pont in the wildly slow intonations and recurrent pauses of his speech. In fact, seeing du Pont's erratic behavior and the uncomfortable homoerotic undertones throughout, there's a hilarious black comedy lingering beneath the surface, to the most deceptive extent where laughter seems wholly out of place once you recognize the sheer bleakness of this material. The history of his childhood—of his fortunate birth into and the inheritance from an insanely rich family, is incredibly fascinating. He was born into money without a single clue how to best use it or what to really do with himself. <br/><br/>Most of all, what I most admire about Foxcatcher is the perfectly uncompromising, dark direction that Miller takes with this tale. The exceptional cinematography makes sure to emphasize the arrant somberness of the fog that encompasses its characters as the chilliness of a colder winter closes in. There's no tenderness to please mass audiences with here; there's only brutal honesty. Using the frustration with the typical cop-out approaches most biopics take nowadays by becoming a little too close to their subjects and portraying them as completely perfect specimens (hello, The Theory of Everything), Foxcatcher never gets scared away from showing just how flawed and disturbed its characters really are—how frightening and enigmatic the mind of a real human being can eventually become. The film takes the advice of du Pont in absolutely exhibiting its confidence and never backing down from depicting tragedy and human nature at its worst. Now, excuse me: I'm going to go read up some more on these peculiar people and the system that brought them together."

"thedukeofmovietown","2","15","31","19 January 2015"," Don't be fooled, it stinks!
","I saw Foxcatcher... The people responsible for making this movie are audited by the IRS and summarily thrown into a dank and cold prison cell in rural Kentucky. Before I get into what made me so upset about this movie, let me give you a quick synopsis about what this hunk of garbage is about. Foxcatcher centers on Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz, played here by Channing Tatum, and his time spent training with eccentric billionaire John E du Ponte, played by Steve Carell, at his palatial training facility for the 1988 Olympic games. Things between Schultz and du Ponte start off OK enough but as time goes on and the audience learns that neither man is the sharpest knife in the drawer nor the sanest, things go off the rails quickly and culminate in an truly horrific way.<br/><br/>This movie has got to be the worst film I've seen in the last 5 years. What this movie is, despite what the trailer would have you believe, is Steve Carell and Channing Tatum staring awkwardly at each other not saying too much and making everyone in the audience feel uncomfortable and bored in a scoreless stagnant bog of white noise and silence as you faintly hear the murmurs of other people in neighboring theaters laughing and having fun for (no lie) TWO HOURS! This goes on until Mark Ruffalo, who plays Mark Schultz's brother David, shows up and all but says, ""what have you guys been doing up here with this audience for the last 2 hours?!"" and Channing Tatum and Steve Carell responded by saying, ""um...philanthropist, ornithologist, philatelist-"" and then Ruffalo has to then try to carve a plot out of the COMPLETE waste of time this movie has been up until then but by the time he does, it's far too little far far far too late. I swear every 10 minutes of this snoozefest of a movie I felt myself on the cusp of shouting ""DO SOMETHING!"" at the screen! The fact that Steve Carell or Mark Ruffalo are nominated for an Academy Awards for their performance in this movie is bordering on a criminal act especially considering people like David Oyelowo and Jake Gyllenhaal will be sitting at the house this year in spite of stellar performances in Selma and Nightcrawler. The only thing that is any good about this film is the makeup that they did on Steve Carell and even that isn't too spectacular seeing as it's just a nose piece from what I could tell. After all I've said, I'll summarize with this, it's one thing to be a bad movie, but to be a BORING bad movie is just unforgivable. Foxcatcher STINKS and I don't like it. It gets a 1... out of 5."
"redhotchilipieper","10","9","17","29 December 2014"," Wrestling with the American Dream
","If Stanley Kubrick had ever gotten around to making a sports movie, it would look and feel a lot like Foxcatcher. Director Bennett Miller's former feature films make him an apt artist to deliver the haunting story of the Schulz brothers and their financial supporter, John E. du Pont. Miller has crafted an unforgettably ominous picture that combines the real life crime genre he chronicled in Capote with the theme of American sports he mastered in Moneyball. The steady stream of subtle foreboding that courses throughout the entirety of Foxcatcher places the film on a trophy shelf of the past decade's other masterworks.<br/><br/>In terms of its plot, many of the trailers for Foxcatcher have given away very little as to what the film is actually about. The incident that Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman bring to the screen is the strange but true story of how millionaire du Pont (Steve Carell) ensnared two Gold Medal-winning wrestlers (Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo) in his perverted pastiche of patriotism and paranoia. On account of its historical reality, the plot, though intriguing, could be looked up on the internet and revealed to anyone with little fanfare. Miller's chillingly compelling direction ensures that Foxcatcher is first and foremost a psychological film.<br/><br/>A fellow critic from Screenrant has criticized Foxcatcher for ""struggling to convey insightful conclusions about its subjects."" While the film is less than lucid, there is no doubt that any room left for interpretation was a purposeful move from Miller. The film studies its three male leads with a level of focus similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's literary character study The Master. Miller's movie says little explicitly, and leaves ample room for audiences to sift through some disturbing subtext. Throughout the course of Foxcatcher, the viewer sees Mark (Tatum), David (Ruffalo), and even du Pont wrestle on the mat, but the true indications of the character's strengths and weaknesses come through cinematographer Greig Fraser's tormented close-ups. The only thing that these mesmerizing Olympians have trouble grappling with is their inner anguish.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of buzz over Steve Carell taking on a dramatic role in Foxcatcher, but skeptics will question whether or not the buzz is justified. Here is the justification: Carell turns in his finest film performance to date as du Pont; the unsettlingly entitled, perplexingly stolid member of America's wealthiest family who has more than his fair share of, shall we say, eccentricities. While the buzz is certainly well-deserved, it turns out that du Pont has much more in common with Carell's signature Dunder-Mifflin manager Michael Scott than one might think. Like Michael, all Du Pont seems to want is love and admiration; validation from human beings who genuinely care for him. However, as infuriating as Michael Scott could be, it is more than safe to say that du Pont proves to be a bigger nightmare of a boss. Carell's understated work in the film elicits gripping fascination from the audience; it is the kind of comedian-turned-dramatist performance that would make the late Robin Williams beam with pride.<br/><br/>Beyond Carell's performance, there is much more to commend in Miller's third feature. Tatum and Ruffalo also turn in career high- point performances. Tatum acts against type as an aloof and stand- offish champion, while Ruffalo portrays the picture's most headstrong character: a family man becoming progressively aware of the strings du Pont has attached to everyone he ropes into his estate. Audiences going to Foxcatcher expecting the next Chariots of Fire or Miracle will be sorely disappointed – viewers should not even approach the movie expecting to learn anything about wrestling itself. One critic from Tolucan Times complains that ""it doesn't explain a thing about Olympic wrestling."" This criticism is invalid. Although there is nothing wrong with being a sports movie, wrestling is virtually irrelevant to the Foxcatcher's real concerns. The filmmakers have turned torpid tabloid fodder into rumination about the all too thin veil of delusion separating the wealthy from the poor, the strong from the weak, and the American from the American Dream.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>By Ben Pieper (November 30th, 2014)"
"robhall546","4","13","27","31 December 2014"," Intriguing, but ultimately boring
","Foxcatcher is a film directed by Bennett Miller, focusing on the murder of wrestler Dave Schulz by John Du Pont, and the relationship between Du Pont and Dave's brother Mark.<br/><br/>Carell's Du Pont is meticulously detailed, but over exaggerated. Credit has to be given to Carell for successfully creating a genuinely creepy persona. However, would this film be as hyped if it starred the familiar faces of Hollywood drama? Tatum commits to the role, but the portrayal of Schulz as a mindless jock, with what appears to be near intellectual disabilities, is comical (Schulz had a 3.6 GPA, and gained a Masters Degree from OU). I felt as if the purpose of this 'character driven' film was to showcase the talents of the actors, and to conceal the weak script.<br/><br/>The cinematography, sound, editing all attempt to build suspense; to alleviate the sense of Du Pont's madness. It was presented like a Social Network rip off, with the score sounding like some of Trent Reznor's C-sides. The film does not have the kind of comprehensively detailed script, or multi-layered undertones to support this kind of slow build up. It is a simple story. Lets compare this to a few other 'slow burners'. Gone Girl, for example is similarly directed, and slowly paced. The difference is, Gone Girl is a mystery, with twists and turns, which constantly evolves to keep the viewer intrigued. No Country For Old Men is slowly paced. However, this film does not contain anywhere near as much thematic of character depth as NCFOM. Intentionally or not, we are left with over an hour of monotonous buildup, followed by a climax that felt rushed. <br/><br/>We are left with so many questions about Du Pont's motives, and so many questions about Mark. In fact, we were barely left with any details about the deterioration of Mark and John's relationship. The film is too busy reiterating the theme of American exceptional-ism, and Du Pont's over patriotism. It plays like a stuck record.<br/><br/>Put bluntly, Foxcatcher is a boring film. I could not think of any circumstance where I would want to watch it again. Well, other than to laugh at Carell's prosthetic nose."

DuPont uses all his wealth and position in society to gain huge success and acknowledgement from his follow Americans, Sport Federations and Mother. In very smart and touching ways Foxcatcher shows and describes the true mentality and daily challenges everyone in society has. With subjects like loneliness, society, family, wealth, hierarchy and various social- classes Director Bennet Miller has combined it all together and shows how and why the fateful actions happen. Do the extremely wealthy such as the DuPont's have more pressure to succeed than the Schultz's? Who is more trapped? Sometimes the film feels just to slow with really nothing happening while the camera captures the stillness of the nature and events developing in front of it, but at the same time that is exactly what Foxcatcher is portraying. Excellent acting by the whole leading cast (Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Sienna Miller) with a never before seen acting performance by Steve Carrell as the odd billionaire John DuPont.

"sickofenjoyingmyself","8","3","4","25 May 2016"," Dark, brooding and thoughtful story. Underrated.
","Foxcatcher was not what I was expecting. I had no knowledge before watching it of the true story that it is based upon so I wasn't sure if I was going to see a glorified sports movie or something deeper. Thankfully it was something deeper. Foxcatcher is a slow building story - etched with tension and foreboding throughout - which results in an astonishingly dramatic climax. Although it is about a wrestling team the actual action of wrestling is not the prominent feature in the movie. Instead it focuses on the main characters - and all three give absolutely outstanding performances that give this story the weight it should have. Channing Tatum gives an excellent turn as Mark Schultz. He is extremely withdrawn, brooding and unfulfilled. I haven't seen Tatum in such a role before and his portrayal of Schultz's torment was formidable. Steve Carell was also cast in an unusual character role. The result was fantastic. He is extremely uncomfortable to watch in every scene. He casts a foreboding shadow throughout the story line with his unpredictable tension. It was clear to me from early on that something was not quite right with him and I think this movie tries to show that Mark Ruffalo as Dave Schultz was also aware of that. Ruffalo arguably outclasses the other two in his supporting role. His portrayal is understated. He is the family man, concerned older brother and protector of his family. He shows genuine concern for others - especially his brother, and shows all the attributes of a good man. He is the true hero of the story and carries the role effortlessly. The story ultimately ends in tragedy, and shockingly so. What this movie also focuses on is mental health and the extremities of human nature. Some people will watch it and bemoan a lack of action or drama. But the drama is within the slow build up. You have to focus on the characters and their behaviour to realise that this is also a study of human psychology. We get an insight into the voluminous toll that pressure to perform takes out on a person's mentality. It makes us consider mental health and how easy it is to spot when someone may be suffering. It is not an easy watch but it is a worthy piece of film making."
"Mobithailand","9","3","4","1 April 2016"," Truth is much stranger than fiction in this very high-quality bio-pic.
","Yet another bio-pic. Well, anyway, it is based on true events.<br/><br/>I didn't think I was going to enjoy this film very much but almost from the start, I was hooked.<br/><br/>It is the fascinating story of the relationship between an upper- class, eccentric multi-millionaire, ( John du Pont), and two working-class, champion wrestlers. The two brothers are already Olympic champion wrestlers at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles and Dupont wants to spearhead their bid for more medals in the 1988 Games in Seoul.<br/><br/>Du Pont persuades the younger of the two brothers (Mark Schultz) to join his wrestling training team, Foxcatcher, and to go and live in his state of the art training facility, which he built as annex to the family mansion. For the first time, Mark rises out of the shadow of his much wiser and revered trainer-brother, Dave.<br/><br/>Du Pont also wants Dave, and for a while, Dave refuses all Du Pont's efforts to recruit him to the team along with his younger brother. After a series of 'issues' with Mark, DuPont eventually persuades Dave and his family to come and join his brother at the training centre.<br/><br/>The father/son relationship which had developed between Mark and Du Pont is shattered and Mark becomes embittered and withdraws into himself as Dave takes over his brother's role and becomes the main trainer of the team.<br/><br/>The 1988 Olympics go badly for Mark and he leaves Du Pont's training camp, later to be followed by his brother. Unfortunately, neither of them quite realised just how crazy Du Pont had become and Dave pays for it with his life.<br/><br/>That this is an off-beat movie , there is no doubt; but as the good folk say, truth is much stranger than fiction and never was that more the case than in this very high-quality movie.<br/><br/>We have a number of fascinating relationships to saliva over: the brotherly love between Dave and Mark; the Du Pont/ Mark, father-son relationship, followed by the break-up of that relationship after Dave's arrival in the training camp. Last, but by no means least, we have the almost Dickensian relationship between Du Pont and his mother; who he could never satisfy and who held an enormous controlling spell over him until her dying day.<br/><br/>It seems to be the case that once Du Pont was free of his mother's controlling influence; his inherent mental instability went into over-drive.<br/><br/>The film is reasonably faithful to what happened in real life, although the timeline in the movie has been very much shortened from the real one. I don't believe this detracts from the integrity of the story and in most important respects, the film faithfully relates how this tragedy played out.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this movie with which I can find fault and it is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination for best movie, which it didn't receive, along with best director, which it did.<br/><br/>As for the actors – all of them play blinders, but you have to single out Steve Carell as Du Pont who acts out of his skin. <br/><br/>And an honourable mention to Vanessa Redgrave who played Du Pont's mother."

","First of all, it is important to realise that this is not a wrestling film. It is rather a chilling and psychological masterpiece from future Oscar-winning director Bennett Miller who once again shows his class through the visual style and mysterious tone of this rather excellent film. The story and the composed directing of this film are brilliant and although the pace of the film may be slow for some, the character studies 'Foxcatcher' unveils are truly exceptional - of three men with different motivations and ambitions. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is the dedicated and highly motivated wannabe gold medallist whose rather frightening performances catches the eye. Then there is his settled and composed older brother Dave Schultz (Mark Rufallo) whose character is rather empathetic and rather tragically likable. And then there is the multimillionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) who gives a career-defining performance as the coach and the mentor of Mark. Steve Carell's performance in particular is very chilling and his uneasy relationship with his disapproving mother is perfectly portrayed. A small negative about this film is the fact it tails off slightly after a brilliant start, but maybe that is just me being harsh. Overall a very solid film with acting performances being as good as they get. Highly recommended. 8.0/10"
"tavm","8","3","4","15 November 2015"," Foxcatcher was a pretty compelling true story tale
","Just watched this with my mom on Netflix disc. This was a pretty compelling story of Mark Schultz-an Olympic wrestler who won the gold in '84 along with his brother Dave-and his relationship with one John du Pont-a loner millionaire who wants to mentor him for the next Olympics. It gets to a pretty dark place though the tone seems quite slow and cold most of the time the film goes on. Channing Tatum and Steve Carell portray Mark and John quite compellingly as does Mark Ruffalo as Dave. As the events unfold, one feels quite stunned at what happens but one can't completely look away when they do. There's no music score, just background recordings that bring some disorienting feeling to bear. So on that note, I recommend Foxcatcher."
"brando647","8","3","4","28 October 2015"," Carell and Tatum are Just Fantastic in FOXCATCHER
","FOXCATCHER is one of those powerful character-driven dramas that I couldn't turn away from. Each of the three main cast membersSteve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffaloare at the top of their game. I have zero interest in the sport of wrestling and I would normally steer clear of a movie with a subject that bores me as much, but there was so much positive buzz circulating about it that I opted to give in and watch. I'm really happy I did because Tatum and Carell give mesmerizing performances. FOXCATCHER is based (loosely, as I have found) on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Tatum) and millionaire John de Pont (Carell). Schultz won the gold medal for wrestling in the 1984 Olympic games and, as the movie begins, he lives a quiet life training with his brother, fellow Olympic gold medalist Dave (Ruffalo), for the next competition. He receives a call from representatives of John du Pont requesting a visit and Schultz, with little else going on, obliges. Du Pont is a wealthy man and member of the famous family behind DuPont Chemicals, and he's interested in sponsoring and coaching Schultz in preparation for the world championships and, eventually, the 1988 Olympics. Schultz agrees to his offer and moves to the estate at Foxcatcher Farm where he trains with the old man. What starts as a well-oiled symbiotic relationship between two wrestling/USA enthusiasts turns sour when Du Pont insists Dave join them at Foxcatcher and the bond between Mark and Du Pont crumbles.<br/><br/>To call John du Pont an interesting man would not be doing it justice. At least in the film, he is a bizarre individual and Carell does it to perfection. Apparently, Carell spent hours studying video footage of the man and even the real Mark Schultz says his performance is almost indistinguishable from the real person. From the start, you can tell Du Pont is abnormal. Perhaps from his isolated, wealthy upbringing or perhaps from a lingering form of mental illness, Du Pont does not interact well with others. You can tell from his speech he views those in lower stations in life as below him. He's narcissistic. He views himself as a patriot, interested in building America's image on the international scale with his attempts at sponsoring an Olympian. But he shares one thing in common with Mark and that is a passion for wrestling. Shunned by his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) for his interested in a ""low"" sport, Du Pont strains for her approval. There's an incredibly awkward moment in the film where Du Pont is lingering around the gym while Dave Schultz is training the Olympic team when Mrs. Du Pont is wheeled in. In an effort to showboat, Du Pont takes center stage and insists on a coaching moment where he feebly shows off a few of the most basic moves. When Mrs. Du Pont loses interest and wheels out, Du Pont drops the act and everyone goes about their business. It makes you cringe at how embarrassing it is for the man and his team, who play along.<br/><br/>I'll try not to let my entire review focus on Carell/Du Pont but it's difficult because he's just such a bizarre character. He finds kinship with Mark and, for a while, both seem the better for it. Before moving to Foxcatcher, Mark lived a lonely existence in his barebones little apartment where he mulled away the hours between visits to the gym. The opportunity presented to him via Du Pont gives him a chance at getting back in the ring while also providing a warped sort of mentor. Tatum deserves as much credit as Carell because this is the best I've seen him. He's a load of fun in the Jump Street movies but this is probably my first time seeing him in a serious drama. Schultz doesn't do much in the way of dialogue but he's got an imposing physical presence. We're introduced to him in the beginning as he's speaking before a school class on his accomplishments and you can tell how out of place he feels. Muscle-bound, he walks with the gait of a large ape and his communication is generally limited to short sentences. This is a man who's focused his entire life on sculpting his body for one purpose. But Tatum injects a lot of character into what at first feels like a simple man. He seems to operate primarily on instinct and the most important part of his life is his brother Dave. He takes a shine to Du Pont early on but eventually sees through the man, altering their relationship in a way that eventually leads to tragedy.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail about the ending here but those who know the story from the news know where it leads. I, for one, knew nothing of it. If there is one major flaw with FOXCATCHER, it's that the finale doesn't have much of a lead in. I had to do additional research on the side to get motivation for the act because the film left me with no clue. It seemed sudden and unmotivated, almost tagged on at the end because the movie was expected to close with it. Still, FOXCATCHER is an intriguing movie and I'm willing to accept its issues. Carell and Tatum are enough of a reason for those who are curious to find time for FOXCATCHER and I think they'll enjoy it."
"markgorman","8","3","4","12 October 2015"," Burn baby burn. (Slowly)
","OK I admit I am late to the party on this one but I missed Foxcatcher's fairly limited release in the UK and have only finally viewed it on DVD. But it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>It's a uniquely paced thriller in that it's almost plot less. The dynamics and emotional drivers of all the main protagonists, two wresting brothers (Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) and their errr 'mentor' (Steve Carell), are never revealed. It's sinister from start to finish but it's never entirely clear why it's sinister particularly if, like me, you don't know the story that it's based on.<br/><br/>But suffice it so say the direction by Bennett Miler (two Oscar nominations under his belt now for this and Capote) is outstanding and grips you from start to finish, despite the fact that very little of any consequence actually happens.<br/><br/>There's an elephant in the movie theatre with this film. And that is homosexuality. Lots of men getting sweaty and grappling with one another on the floor is not the point. It's the unstated relationship between the two main characters that is.<br/><br/>Is the relationship between billionaire wrestling freak Du Pont and Schwartz homosexually charged? Maybe yes, maybe no. Du Pont may wish to be seen as a father figure but it goes much deeper than that in my view.<br/><br/>Is the drug taking and drinking that Du Pont introduces to his Olympic Gold medallist charge some form of seduction? Maybe yes, maybe no.<br/><br/>Is the relationship that Du Pont 'enjoys' with his mother also related to his sexuality (Oedipal almost)? Maybe yes, maybe no.<br/><br/>Certainly it has enraged the real life Schwartz who clearly is not in any way inclined to the male sex but that's not the point. Miller has created a movie that is undeniably homo- erotically charged and that is not in any way a criticism.<br/><br/>The movie is a beautiful enigma wrapped up in a conundrum and all the better for it.<br/><br/>But ultimately what you are left with is the extraordinary performances of Tatum and, especially, Carell in a career defining outing that will surely be hard for him to beat. <br/><br/>And one last point; the outstanding soundtrack by Rob Simonsen is a pretty fundamental contribution to the whole mood of the piece."

","I have no interest whatever in wrestling and very little in the life styles of the enormously wealthy except in comedies but this film is original and curiously gripping throughout.<br/><br/>The story is based on historical fact and goes something like this. Channing Tatum is an taciturn amateur wrestler hoping to compete in the Olympics of 1988. His brother Mark Ruffalo is his older brother, coach, and best friend -- or ONLY friend as far as we're able to discern. Ruffalo is a laid back kind of guy, supporting his wife and two daughters. Both brothers live in one of those Northeast working-class shack towns of the sort I grew up in.<br/><br/>Then, one day, fate steps into their lives. Du Fate takes the corporeal form of Steve Carell as John du Pont, the fortyish scion of the self-proclaimed ""wealthiest family in America"" -- they own Delaware -- calls Tatum and invites him to Foxcatcher, the family estate somewhere in the neighborhood of Washington.<br/><br/>To keep it short, Carell acts as wrestling mentor to Tatum and in fact practically adopts him. Carell also gathers a squad of half a dozen promising wrestlers and is going to fund them through the next Olympics, with himself as the head of ""Team Foxcatcher."" He also hires the quietly cheerful Ruffalo but over time comes to resent Ruffalo's bond with Tatum. Carell wants to do all the bonding around here. It leads to tragedy.<br/><br/>The film is about as far away from the typical ""docudrama"" as you can get. It's imaginative in almost every respect and plaudits are due especially to Bennett Miller, the director, and editors Jay Cassidy, Stuart Levy, and Conor O'Neil who have figured out the precise length to let a scene linger on the screen.<br/><br/>The performances of the three principals is unimpeachable. Channing Tatum is first seen as an inarticulate brute, shuffling around in a gym, his eyes cast down as always. He speaks in grunts. True, he's a college graduate (I won't name the university, which must be known for its wrestling team) but we can't help asking whose breath blew out the light within this brain. When he tries to read the word ""philanthropist"" it comes out ""philogulist."" Steve Carrell is unforgettable as the rich guy. He's got a schnozz on him like a bald eagle and when he speaks -- or even when he doesn't speak -- he tilts his head back and stares down his nose like William F. Buckley. And that voice, so accommodating, so bland, so pragmatic. When he learns that Ruffalo doesn't want to move to Foxcatcher because his family is now established elsewhere, Carrell asks tonelessly, ""How much does he want?"" Nothing is made of it but it tells us a great deal about being rich.<br/><br/>I don't know how closely it hews to historical reality. I'd never heard of the case. And it's not easy to figure out the dynamics in the narrative because it isn't spelled out for us, as it would be in a child's ABC book. The writer and director have enough trust in the maturity of the audience to let us figure it out for ourselves.<br/><br/>My guess? The mother-dominated rich boy is starved for love. He had one friend in his childhood -- until he discovered that his mother was PAYING the other kid to be a friend. Well, now he's got a whole wrestling team that adores him as their angel. The presence of Ruffalo as the coach who knows what he's about interferes with that paternalistic relationship, not to mention the implicit homoeroticism. Carrell is jealous of Ruffalo.<br/><br/>But you're entitled to your own guess. Or make no guess at all and just watch the understated imagery float with such aplomb across the screen. I'm glad I caught it, though it didn't unleash a love of wrestling. Where I grew up it was all schoolyard fist fights and bloody noses. Like Vanessa Redgrave as the starchy old mother, we'd have considered wrestling a ""low sport."""
"petra_ste","8","3","4","30 August 2015"," Did you catch the fox today, Mother?
","If movies have taught me anything, it's never to accept an accommodation from a man who collects stuffed birds and lives with a mysterious, reclusive mother. Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), however, doesn't look like one who watches many movies - he is shown as a huge, somber man focused solely on his training, unlike his elder brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), more genial and family-oriented.<br/><br/>Therefore, when millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) offers Mark economic support and a job in an isolated country mansion as coach of his personal wrestling team, Mark jumps at the chance. It doesn't take long before du Pont shows a sinister streak: usually as emotionless as a cold fish, he displays mood swings, wakes Mark up in the middle of the night for impromptu training sessions, fires a gun in the gym to gain attention; worst of all, he has an unhealthy obsession to be seen as a leader.<br/><br/>There are also strong homosexual undertones, with the suggestion that du Pont's penchant for training with burly young men was not merely a product of his love for sport.<br/><br/>Channing is fine as a dour, simple man faced with one humiliation too many. Carell, cast against type, is surprisingly creepy: with a beak-like nose and a smile as rare as it is unpleasant, his du Pont delivers endless moral platitudes, his vacuous stare showing hints of a malevolent nature. As soon as we meet him, we know it's not going to end up well between him and the Schultzes, and this tension drives the whole script.<br/><br/>The best is Ruffalo in the least showy role of a decent family man struggling to mediate between his brother and their boss. In a neat little scene, he has to record an interview for one of du Pont's self-celebrating documentaries. When asked to describe du Pont's influence and teachings, he struggles to distill a plausible answer from his boss' vapid inanities; deeply uncomfortable, he claims du Pont is his mentor, words sticking in his throat. However, Dave ultimately proves more resilient than Mark, which leads to unsettling developments.<br/><br/>A compelling psychological drama. <br/><br/>7,5/10"
"bryank-04844","8","3","4","12 August 2015"," While it might drag a bit, 'Foxcatcher' worth the dark journey to take this riveting ride.
","Director Bennett Miller has chosen his four films wisely. Starting with 'The Cruise' back in 1998, Miller has only three more films on his resume, including 'Foxcatcher'. The previous two were 'Capote' was an Oscar winner as well as 'Moneyball'. Miller has an uncanny knack for telling compelling stories that are based on real life events and engaging the audience to not only be entertained, but to think and discuss these characters and sometimes real people's motives in what they did in their particular story. You can add to that, Miller's success in getting his actors to win Oscars almost across the board, and this very dark and creepy film 'Foxcatcher' is no different.<br/><br/>Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, 'Foxcatcher' has many layers that all fall into the disturbing, freakish, and ultimately tragic character study of one man. It's quite an emotional and difficult journey to take in the theater. One that is sometimes a bit on the slow side, but none-the-less, brilliant. And it is here, where you can see Steve Carell, virtually transform into one of the creepiest characters in recent memory.<br/><br/>That story follows or shall I say centers on the story that shocked a nation back in the mid 1990s where a member of one of the wealthiest families in the world, John du Pont (Carell), murdered a longtime friend, gold medal Olympic winner in wrestling Dave Schultz, in cold blood. And Miller, Frye, and Futterman try to show us some of the motives that might have caused du Pont to commit this atrocious act. The film is actually told through the eyes of Dave Schultz's brother, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who also won the gold medal in wrestling at the 1984 Olympics with his brother.<br/><br/>However, three years later, he is barely getting by in his small apartment and making money by trying to encourage elementary school kids to be excited about school and sports. His brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), seems to be doing a bit better with his beautiful wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and their young kids in Colorado. One thing is for sure though. Mark is a very hard worker and determined to be the best he can be, which is why he almost immediately accepts a first class ticket to to the du Pont estate to talk with John du Pont, an older and very creepy man with very pale skin and very unnerving eyes. His nose protrudes out quite far, but John always keeps it tilted upwards as if he's better than everyone else. It will take a minute, but this man is in fact Steve Carell under heavy makeup, and he just owns this unconventional role.<br/><br/>From when du Pont starts to talk with Mark, you can tell the creepy factor is there, but his speeches are actually quite encouraging and patriotic, which is the key to getting Mark to sign on with du Pont as his coach and manager for future competitions. But it's very clear early on that du Pont has other motives. Du Pont is a weak person, both physically and mentally, with only his extreme wealth to shield him from anything harmful with the exception of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and her love for horses, which he despises. In fact, if you met du Pont on the street, you would probably veer to the other side, but due to his money, he has been in the best school and best social circle, but alas, he has no friends.<br/><br/>Only servants. After Mark wins a few contests, du Pont makes him a coach and sets up a compound on his property called Foxcatcher where they will find the best athletes in the wrestling world to compete in future Olympic games. But for some reason, du Pont turns on Mark, even calling him names, and enlists the help of his brother Dave to more or less take over. Over the course of this segment, du Pont more than just verbally abuses Mark. While it's never shown beyond that, it's definitely implied. The dynamic and relationships keep transforming and shifting between these three characters, so much so, that each relationship is very brutal to watch in its spiraling downfall, up until the horrid tragedy. But it makes for a very compelling experience, on that you can't believe actually happened.<br/><br/>Miller has concocted a brilliant piece of storytelling and conjured up some award winning performances from his cast. While the film plays a bit slow at times, these performances and characters keep things very interesting and terrifying. The story is told over the course of a decade, and the editors and director did a fine job in connecting each big bit of the story together to tell us what just went through du Pont's mind that lead him to murder. Carell is one of the finest actors out there right now. I know we're all used to seeing him make us laugh and act goofy, but he is equally good at playing sadistic and creepy ,and it shows perfectly here with his mannerisms and speech. You'll feel your skin crawl every time he's on screen.<br/><br/>Tatum turns in a very volatile and excellent performance as well. You can see the pain and agony on his face in every frame, and you just want him to do the right thing. And of course Ruffalo is amazing here as well, as he is the best friend everybody wished they had. He pulls it off with such genuine charisma, that it really is a punch in the stomach when we get to his untimely fate. 'Foxcatcher' is a well done film and a great addition to Miller's resume. While it might drag a bit, it's worth the dark journey to take this riveting ride."

","I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this movie blew me out of the water. No, this is not a wresting movie. It is a brilliant exposition of character. I suppose what amazes me the most is that the two main stars are known (and very successfully) as comedic actors. Steve Carell was just amazing playing John du Pont. The real Mark Schultz says in an interview, he thought John had been raised from the dead. I am always so impressed when actors go beyond to show what they can do, which is so far beyond what they have done before. This is certainly true of Steve Carell and also Channing Tatum, who is known mostly for light comedies and showing off his abs. So much attention and deserved award nominations were given to Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo (who is ALWAYS amazing), but to me it was Channing Tatum who broke real barriers and fully proved that he is an actor with great talent.<br/><br/>The cinematography, combined with brilliant music and artful direction, created an atmosphere that was breathtaking. This is a movie of characters, created by phenomenal actors through their actions, their speech, their motions and their eyes. This is a phenomenal film if what you want to see is the creation of complex human beings in all their glory and in all their flaws.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

","If you have a movie that at first sight is about an athlete and his (olympic) dreams, you kind of can guess where the movie goes. And even though there are a few things that you can predict, there's a lot left unsaid and a lot more that might surprise you (especially if you aren't aware of the real life incidents that occurred, something that can be said about me).<br/><br/>So while this is overcoming the odds, it is also about struggling and living in a world that is not that appreciated, not having much of a family to back you up (or a mother that might push you to do certain things, although everyone is responsible for their own actions of course). The dynamic between the actors is really good and you might have problems recognizing Carrell. Also some nice interviews on the disc about the making of the movie"
"secondtake","7","3","4","19 June 2015"," Too slow for many, but the patience pays off--Olympic pressure redefined
","Foxcatcher (2014)<br/><br/>Based on fact, a movie about Olympic wrestlers training at the estate of tycoon family du Pont near Valley Forge. Even though it's about sport and sports at the highest level, this is the opposite of an action movie. The central figure is mean to be one of two actual Olympic level brothers who wrestled in the 1980s, but in a way the tone of the movie is dictated by the patron, wealthy heir to the du Pont fortune, John du Pont. He's played with impeccable, disturbed restraint by Steve Carell.<br/><br/>The brothers are of course important, and slightly different in their makeup. Mark (played by Channing Tatum) is seemingly simple, almost slow, and he gets sucked into du Pont's plans rather easily. Dave (played by Mark Ruffalo) is more savvy, an older and more experienced wrestler.. And easy going, a family man who everyone likes. Except John du Pont.<br/><br/>Don't let the patience fool you. Carell is uncanny—his performance seems to be a non- performance, but it never flags. Tatum is right on with his feeling for an athlete devoted to his ability above all, but missing the larger picture. Ruffalo, though in a small role, ends up the most sympathetic character, and by the end, if you agree, you'll be in tears.<br/><br/>You sometimes wonder about how Olympic athletes get their support and what the price is to them personally. Though a long way from Communist bloc versions of control and abuse (and obsession), this is a perfectly horrifying and insidious American counterpart. Not to be missed if you like sports, sports movies, or the Olympics on any level."

","This is one of the movies that made me seriously think even a while after I watched them. There are several psychological ""planes"" that are successfully addressed and intertwine in the movie. But the one about the weaknesses and how they make us allow to reach for the ""straw to cling after"" is really the harsh one. In this case it shows how even the natural and logical order of values crumbles beneath one's complex, pride or fear. And how such emotional irrationality paves the way for terminal decisions that might eventually have serious consequences not only for the one involved, but for the people around incl. loved ones. As I said, this is a complex movie, where mentioned is only one of subjects that wander through the internal labyrinth of human psyche and external inter-human relationships. For me, it was a hard psychological drama, far from a plain sports movie."

I don't know where he pulled his performance out of. Playing the role of the awkward and reclusive one time gold medal Olympic winner was a cinch for him. He totally immersed himself into character. I was super impressed and gained so much respect for him.<br/><br/>And Mr. Carell. Seriously? Why did you conceal your talent for so long? He totally nailed the part of the wealthy, creepy, lonely man with mommy issues. I actually fund my self cringing during the scene when he tried to impress his mom by pretending to be the coach and when the guy was paid to lose to him in the wrestling match.<br/><br/>Bravo all around.

"bkoganbing","9","3","4","7 March 2015"," One uptight man
","Before watching and writing about Foxcatcher I did a bit of research about John DuPont and it confirmed what I saw in this film. Before any of the action of this film takes place, DuPont already had been accused of making improper advances by one man. He was also ever so briefly married, just like Rock Hudson.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell plays the uptight and repressed gay man John DuPont with a minimum of dialog and emotion, but with facial and body language that tell more than 20 pages of script could. He well deserved to be nominated for Best Actor.<br/><br/>John DuPont is from one of America's richest families and he's a man with a lot of money and a lot of time on his hands. He's developed an interest in wrestling and not the kind that Vince McMahon gives us three night a week. He decides to develop and finance a team of wrestlers that will win all championships including Olympic gold. Carrell is like George Steinbrenner with an open checkbook in the free agency market.<br/><br/>Two of his wants are the brothers Schultz. Mark is played by Channing Tatum and he is dazzled by the world that Carrell wants to invite him into. Carrell is crushing out on Channing Tatum big time which is understandable. David the older and more successful brother is played by Mark Ruffalo who got a Best Supporting Actor nomination is harder to get, but he does succumb. It leads to one unspeakable tragedy.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher also got nominations for Best Director, Best Makeup, and Best Original Screenplay. It didn't come away with any statues though.<br/><br/>I should also mention Vanessa Redgrave as Carrell's grand dame of society mother who is as uptight as her son. She too with minimal dialog conveys this branch of the large DuPont family is one uptight limb of the family tree.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a deeply disturbing, but very good film to see."
"asher-luberto","9","3","4","5 March 2015"," Caught me by surprise!
","Foxcatcher is directed by Bennett Miller (Moneyball), and stars Channing Tatum, Steve Carrel and Mark Ruffalo. Past Tatum movies ( 21 Jump Street, white House Down, and Magic Mike) and Carrel's movies ( 41 year Old Virgin, Anchorman, and the popular TV show the office) are nothing like this one. Foxcatcher is a dark drama about two gold metal wrestlers striving to win another medal. Truthfully I haven't seen great acting from either Tatum, or Carrel, and thats why this movie caught me by surprise! Both delivered powerful and riveting performances, and I'm not the only one that thought so, The academy nominated both of them for awards, and the movie was up for best picture. This movie follows two brothers ( Mark and David Shultz). Both of their lives revolve around the sport of wrestling. They both wrestle in the olympic, David (Mark Rufalo) seems to be the more well off one of the pair. He seems to have more skill than his brother, and also have a wife and kids. Where has Tatum only has his brother, and now that his brother has to spend time with his family, he doesn't have as much time for his brother. Steve Carrel ( John du Pont) invites Mark ( Tatum) to work at the facility on his estate. And thats the basic story without revealing any spoilers. This movie is powerful and inspiring. And is one of the best films of 2014."
"chicagopoetry","4","12","25","27 December 2014"," Incredibly Boring and Confusing
","I was really surprised by how boring Foxcatcher is. I was expecting something much more intense. Steve Carell is superb in his strictly dramatic portrayal of John du Pont; he's barely recognizable. And Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also give it their all. But for the life of me, I have no idea what was going on. What was the problem between du Pont and Mark Schultz? Why did du Pont do what he did at the end of the film? <br/><br/>I was expecting something in the lines of Rocky and instead it was more like Behind the Candelabra. I know it's based on a true story but I had no idea what the motivation of anyone was, why what was happening was happening. And the editing made it so long and drawn out. In one scene, du Pont asks his driver if it's snowing out; the driver says no, and then they just stand / sit there for ten or more seconds as if something important was happening in the stillness and silence. Except nothing important was happening. They were just sitting / standing there. That's just one example of many, many scenes that went on way too long giving this film no pace whatsoever.<br/><br/>When the credits finally rolled after two long hours all I could do was shrug and ask ""What the hell was that even about?"""
"boydwalters","3","13","28","7 January 2015"," How did they manage to make this story SOOOO DULLL ?
","Sorry this story had major possibilities and Hollywood made a complete mess of it as usual ... Hey Hollywood ... Don't you realise yet that until you start employing talented writers and directors that are capable of having a broader vision than their last washing powder commercial you are going to get less and less people interested in seeing your films Channing Tatum had obviously been directed to act like a retard ... OK he might not be the most talented actor, but this was farcical ... Steve Caroll ( whoever he is ) was just one dimensional skin crawly ... I would of thought the fact that the character was an totally untalented, over privileged arms dealer would probably have been enough to make the point without the creepy performance The major problem of course is its just not in the slightest bit exciting or interesting And god knows where this winging about homo eroticism comes from cos this yawn fest is way less sexual than even the most average wrestling match"
"tabbyindia","2","11","23","29 December 2014"," The Amazing Acting Was Ruined.
","Generally, I was extremely disappointed with this film after hearing such good reviews and because of that I was really looking forward to watching it. I had no idea what it was about because a friend told me it was more interesting to see when you know nothing of the story. Being a teenager I had never seen this story on the news and therefore had never heard of the incident and this means I had no inkling of what would happen.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying that I think the acting was phenomenal, especially Carell and Ruffalo. Carell was disturbingly creepy and basically very well acted, it was such a change from his usual comedic roles as well so it made it even more fascinating. I also thought Ruffalo was a really nice and likable character so it was a shame he was only present for half the film. Tatum was good to but not up to the others standards.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they were the only good aspects of the film. This film was very slow in my opinion and there were either shots that were too long or ones that were plain pointless. It was a 2 hour film yet apart from the murder, nothing really happened. What really made it fail (the build up to the murder) was the fact that in reality they could never find out this true motive for John committing the crime so they therefore couldn't say what it was in the film. This meant that there was no big revelation at the end of finding out what is specifically wrong with John du Pont, it was just a boring film with a confusing murder. I understand it was obvious that he was a very odd and disturbing character but it still gave no reason. In my opinion they should have done the film more like how it really happened. By this I mean have the first half of the film building up to the murder of Dave and setting the scene and the second half of the film about John's 2 days of solitude in his house negotiating with the police and then his sentence and diagnosis, this would make it faster as more happens and we would then be aware of some of the reason why he did it. If you don't know it's because he was a paranoid schizophrenic and thought Dave was going to kill him.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was fantastic but the rest completely let it down which I think is a huge shame for the actors that worked so hard."
"jadepietro","8","7","13","24 December 2014"," This Sporting Life
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>John Eleuthère du Pont, heir to the du Pont fortune and avid sports fan. Mark Schultz, Olympic wrestling champion. Dave Schultz, brother of Mark, friend of John, and another Olympic winner. This trio comes together, setting their sights on a common goal in Bennett Miller's compelling fact-based drama, Foxcatcher.<br/><br/>Steve Carell plays the obsessive du Pont, a wealthy entrepreneur who loves to collect things: stamps, stuffed animals, firearms, money, and athletes. He starts a wrestling school called Foxcatcher Farm with his loftiest goal to reach that Olympic gold. But there is no glory in this tragic story, as he begins to nurture the young ambitious Mark, under the tutelage and help of his devoted older brother and develops a strange hold on both siblings.<br/><br/>Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futtleman, Foxcatcher tells its story of corruption, power, wealth, and control with a minimum of dramatic flourish. Their screenplay documents this stranger-than-fiction true story, but the slow pacing of the film tends to distill the impact of the circumstances. The three main characters are well-written but other supporting roles seem sketchy and not as strongly developed. The time line of events seems blurred also, especially the physical transformation of Mark Schultz who gains and loses poundage in mega-minutes.<br/><br/>However, Foxcatcher does have, in its corner, superb performances. Channing Tatum delivers the best work as the beleaguered wrestler, unsure of his talent and overly-eager to please. Mark Ruffalo grounds his character and shows a loving brother and competitive coach simultaneously with such subtlety and conviction. Vanessa Redgrave, Sienna Miller, and Anthony Michael Hall give solid support in their underwritten roles. <br/><br/>But earning the gold for this film is Carell as the schizophrenic philanthropist. The actor sheds his comic talent and delves into the psychotic world of du Pont with a fury of emotions that will startle and deeply sadden any moviegoer. He plays this complicated character as an outsider, a short stocky oddity, out-of-touch with reality and consumed with escalating rage. This is certainly a banner year for actors and their physical transformation and Carell's portrayal is one of this year's finest. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher is well directed by Miller who seems to have a special fascination with eccentric characters, as shown in his two previous films (Capote, Moneyball). He shrewdly establishes the characters and their relationships almost immediately but rarely lets the actual suspense build. One wonders (and never fully comprehends) the bizarre behavior on the screen and the illogical actions of these characters without any immediate consequences early on, questioning why the warning signals were so readily overlooked to prevent this outcome. Never the screenplay, characters, or direction clearly answer that issue.<br/><br/>One may know the outcome of the film well before viewing. But Foxcatcher deals with its violence unflinchingly and tackles the issue of mental health in a no-holds-barred way. Foxcatcher carries with it a ring of truth about the madness of sports, competition, and raw ambition, and while it may not fully deliver on its initial promise to captivate and impress its audience, it does have three stunning bits of acting that are top contenders this year. That alone makes the film worth viewing. GRADE: B<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"kitch22","1","9","18","3 March 2015"," Don't watch this film if you like cinema...
","...or if you have eyes! What a boring film. It may be 'character driven' but unfortunately the characters involved are very dull people. This film could have told it's story in about 30 minutes without loosing anything. There is hardly any dialogue and it feels just padded out with long panning shots and scenes where nothing happens. I think Steve Carell is after being taken seriously because you can practically hear the strain of him acting as hard as he can, and what is the point of going to great pains to look and act like a person when nobody knows what the person looks or acts like?<br/><br/>This film isn't fit to lace the boots of the Lego Movie."
"lucierigby98","5","9","18","10 January 2015"," A 2 hour film based on a 2 second climax.
","To say this film was bad would be lying. However, I wouldn't argue against calling it boring. The whole narrative lacks a key element of good cinema, which is audience involvement. To truly have an effect on spectators, they need to NOT be spectators. They need to be companions to the film, to the characters, to the storyline; their response to the film needs to have significance and purpose. <br/><br/>The reason why cinema has such a big impact on people is because they are plucked from their seats dragged into the story. Foxcatcher just doesn't have this aspect. The characters are not well-established at all. At no point in the film did I empathise with Mark, John, or Dave, and likewise, at no point in the film was I rooting for any of them. It felt like I was just sitting there, watching. I didn't really care what happened to any of them.<br/><br/>Along with this, the narrative consisted of essentially nothing. If you asked me, I believe that without all the irrelevant scenes, the film would last not even an hour. It felt like they were using bland fight scenes and dull training montages in order to give the sense we were watching something that wasn't completely void of a storyline. The only point in the film that truly had an effect on me was the climax at the end, which I can assure you was not worth the 1 and a half hours I had wasted watching the fodder to this scene.<br/><br/>Pseudo-tension was also created with a repetitive and somewhat annoying use of silence which accompanied almost every scene. In theory, it may seem like a good, thoughtful idea, but when you're sitting in a theatre of 100+ people, silence translates to 'who is crunching that popcorn in row 5 and why do they have to be so goddamn loud about it'. <br/><br/>Now, to perhaps the most disappointing part of the whole film, Steve Carrells performance. After it being so hyped up, and knowing his history in comedy, I was definitely looking forward to this 'Oscar-Worthy' performance. Let's just say he didn't deliver. Every scene that involved him was boring, as he just didn't have the acting ability or technique to make DuPont beyond a bland talking voice and instead a complex, conflicted character. I do really love Steve Carrell as an actor, and I especially love him in The Office, but I just wish they'd have chosen someone who would have added to the film, instead of taken away.<br/><br/>In the right hands, this story could have been gripping, horrifying, and humbling all at the same time. Unfortunately, this adaption flopped. 5/10"

","""Foxcatcher"" (2014) by Bennett Miller staring Channing Tatum, Steve Carell, and Mark Ruffalo in the true story of the relationship between two Olympic Wrestling Champions of the 1984 Olympics and million dollar mogul, John DuPont is at the top of my list of Best Films of 2014. I saw this at the 2014 AFI Fest Premiere in Los Angeles. Although I will admit that the venue and event I saw this at added to the film's spectacle and my anticipation, the film was truly beautiful. The aesthetics and overall mood of the film grabbed me. If Bennett Miller thought to himself to ""I want to make this film a dark, creepy, and suspenseful."" then he truly succeeded. Foxcatcher embodies darkness yet the cinematography and lighting of the DuPont estate being a mansion surrounded by nature and later the light of the snow completely contradict your emotions of darkness and suspense. Although the rave is around Steve Carell for his depiction of John DuPont, Channing Tatum, I feel, doesn't steal the show but he is the show. His performance is what we follow the whole film and It is hard to see anyone else in this part. The acting done by the cast being Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo are superb and it is hard to see anyone else in their parts. The story is dark with humor which you aren't sure is more creepy than funny. 8/10 Silver Rating."
"laskinner-124-924636","5","9","19","23 December 2014"," Too opaque
","The film is beautifully shot and the director knows how to shoot landscape to illuminate a story like no one else but the movie remains hobbled by the director and writer's inability to make the DuPont character anything less than opaque. He remains an enigma from beginning to end. If this was their idea it is a fatal error because with no way into DuPont's character we are at a loss on who to process the information that unfolds. Steve Carell gives a good performance with very little material to work with on this role. We never understand ""how"" he came to the terrible last moments of the film. Mark Ruffalo gives the most complete portrait in the movie in the supporting role of Mark--he truly transcends the material. Channing Tatum (not a favorite of mine) is adequate in looking like a clueless ape in the movie, but he like Steve Carell fall victim to the inadequacies of the script. Vanessa Redgrave is underused and clearly her part could have illuminated many of the aspects of her son's character. The narrative seemed inadequate to the story being told. Or the story it seemed they wanted to tell but could not."

","I couldn't for the life of me see how anyone was going to turn a book about wrestling into a brooding thriller, and the trailer for it frankly looked about as gay as a c*ck in a frock and his socks on a rock in Bangkok.<br/><br/>But 'Foxcatcher' turns out to be a relentlessly dark, hypnotically tense, creepy film that's almost anti-Hollywood in all its silence and subtlety, with so many of the most powerful moments being communicated through pauses, glances, flickers of recognition and realization, with no dumbing down or over-explaining to the cattle-stalls. Amazing they got such big names in to make it, even if you can't recognize the most famous one in it at all.<br/><br/>Really, it's only a film 'about' wrestling in so far as Million Dollar Baby is a film 'about' boxing. And nowhere near as depressing, either, so that helps."
"asda-man","9","5","9","18 February 2015"," Chilling drama which soars like an eagle!
","Foxcatcher has the absorbing coldness of a film by Michael Haneke. I had zero interest when I read that it was about Olympic wrestling, however my interest was lighted when I saw the sinister trailer for the film and found out that it was in fact a psychological drama and not some sort of rites-of-passage sports movie. Unfortunately, I did read about the ending and started kicking myself when many critics recommended reading nothing on the true story. So although the ending was no surprise to me, it was still pretty shocking.<br/><br/>However, there's much more to admire about the film than its tragic finale. A lot of people have called the film too slow and boring, and whilst it is very slow paced, I never found it boring for a moment. People who find this film boring would probably end up committing suicide if they put themselves through something like Uzak! I did think that it was longer than it needed to be, but it wasn't much of a detraction. Apparently, the original rough cut was almost 4 hours long so the editors have done well to whittle it down to a trim 130 minutes.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film perfectly illustrates the lonely existence of wrestler, Mark Schultz. The shots are long, uninterrupted and the lighting is dim. Mark existence is based purely around wrestling as he lacks any sort of social life. His brother is his only friend and even he isn't that friendly towards him. Things change when similarly socially inept, John Du Pont invites him over to his mansion and asks to join his wrestling team and train for the Olympics.<br/><br/>There's a thick foreboding atmosphere which penetrates throughout the film. A lot of the sinister edge comes from Steve Carell's outstanding portrayal of wrestling and bird enthusiast, John Du Pont. He's almost unrecognisable with his gigantic prosthetic nose which could outdo Katie Hopkins! He doesn't look, sound or act all that human. There's an otherworldly quality to him and you can't help but become completely absorbed whenever he's on screen. He's an unpredictable character who always remains compelling. The maniacal end scene urged me to find out more about the true life case.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with Channing Tatum, who is normally cast as the pretty boy in rom-coms. His performance is pretty intense and a large amount of method acting was involved too. Apparently when he smashed his head on the mirror it was completely improvised! Mark Ruffalo didn't impress me quite as much but he still held his own. Really it's Steve's show and you'll go away from the film with his haunting performance in your mind.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a supremely creepy and atmospheric film. It's a character and relationship study. Watching John and Mark become friends is quietly gripping. Their fallout is all the more interesting. It's beautifully directed and its quiet surrealism adds to the film's sinister atmosphere. Perhaps it's a little too slow for mass audiences, but fans of Michael Haneke and Paul Thomas Anderson will undoubtedly find a lot to like. I know that I did!"
"DareDevilKid","9","5","9","17 February 2015"," Chilling, Perverse, Somber, Provoking
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.2/5 stars<br/><br/>Bennett Miller's new film, based on true events, is an extremely cold, creepy, and brilliant examination of the spookiest edges of the male psyche. It is methodical, deliberate, kind of heartbreaking, but mostly simply chilling. Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, and Steve Carell deliver magnetic, career-topping performances in a compelling, quietly disturbing drama about sport, wealth, lost manhood, mommy issues, and murder.<br/><br/>Tatum and Ruffalo play real-life US wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz, Olympic gold Medalists both, who are conscripted by gazillion-heir John du Pont to spearhead a training unit of wrestlers with the goal of achieving success at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Exactly why du Pont wants to do such a thing with his money and, essentially, his life; how he goes about it; and how the brothers respond to him and the claustrophobic atmosphere of his camp form the sinew of this mysterious and foreboding drama.<br/><br/>And it is foreboding no doubt. The film is a little over two hours of menace, all cloudy skies, peculiar conversations, and chilly rooms and landscapes. du Pont is a creep and Miller and Carell don't soften him an inch. A soft-spoken man of gentle demeanor and few words, du Pont's enterprise at first seems to be fuelled by fierce patriotism. Such is the impression he wants to give. America has become beleaguered and self-hating, he believes. He wants to see it soar again, and putting together a wrestling team is one way he can do that.<br/><br/>Mark is readily seduced and quickly begins enjoying both success in the sport, the pleasures of upper-crust socializing, and various other perks such as an endless supply of free cocaine. Dave proves a much harder nut to crack; du Pont is almost offended when Mark tells him his initial refusals are not a matter of money. Dave's eventual submission comes with a good deal of suspicion from du Pont, a man unused to being questioned, let alone defied or denied.<br/><br/>Complicating matters to a level that would make Norman Bates blush, we slowly learn that underlying everything is the Vader-like presence of du Pont's mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Though now frail and ferried about in a wheelchair, she maintains an unhealthy command over her son's life and his self-regard as a man.<br/><br/>Attention is being called towards Steve Carell's transformative performance as the creepy John du Pont, and he's also snagged an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Actor"", which is totally fair enough. However, really, this film is built solidly on a remarkable three-piece ensemble, with Mark Ruffalo and to some extent Channing Tatum giving no less inspiring, and deeply skillful, performances. After many hints (""10 Years"", ""Side Effects"", ""Magic Mike"") Tatum proves himself a serious dramatic actor while Ruffalo, as the older brother, brings a mesmerizingly edgy protectiveness to the fore. But this is, ultimately, Carell's film. Unrecognizable under brilliantly sculpted clumps of nose-enhancing face makeup, he simply sinks into the character of a man whose hope for his country is countered by his own self doubts.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller showed with ""Capote"" (2005) and ""Moneyball"" (2011) his mastery over slow-burn drama, where stillness both commands your attention and makes you brace for a sudden change of pace. He deploys that skill set abundantly in ""Foxcatcher"" to great effect, aided no end by the haunting cinematography of Australian Greig Fraser (""Last Ride"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"", ""The Gambler""). The movie is admirably restrained in keeping everyone's goals, if not obtuse, at least opaque; it's an extremely intelligent film that allows for great degrees of analysis, interpretation, and speculation. Miller's measured pacing and the film's overwhelmingly bleak tone are not geared to the YouTube generation; this is a thoughtful, adult film, and quite brilliant. Because of its deliberately slow pace it must be said that ""Foxcatcher"" is not for everybody. Some might simply find it too slow and possibly, even, boring. Those who respond to it, however, will find themselves sucked into a world where pride, privilege, and a sizeable measure of perversion collide."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","5","9","16 February 2015"," Cold, thrilling and dramatic, Foxcatcher scores across the board
","Every time I thought I had found my favourite scene in Foxcatcher, another appears on screen. Its the scene where duPont wins the farce of a 50+ wrestling tournament, or its the scene where duPont forces Dave to rave about his mentorship, or its Mark's school assembly address, or the scene where duPont's mother comes to watch the wrestling. I just can't choose<br/><br/>The Fighter meets The Last King of Scotland in this chillingly directed, superbly acted, intricately scripted and all around stunning film by Bennett Miller. In just two hours, Foxcatcher delves deeply into three key relationships - Dave and Mark, Mark and John, and John and his mother. The relationship between Mark and John is the focal point of the film and is truly excellent, thanks to beautiful writing and stunning performances from Channing Tatum and Steve Carell.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is from another planet in this film. When he first appears outside Mark's window, I almost died in fright. Chilling, frightening and yet amazingly sympathetic in places, Carell gives one of the finest performances of 2014. Bennett Miller's brilliant move in having Carell place his most dark thought on a piece of paper and have it within Miller's reach during filming, if I identify the scene correctly, was a masterful move and brought something very special to Foxcatcher. Carell's duPont is narcissistic, obsessive, paranoid, bitter, jealous and resentful, and Carell displays all of this with unparalleled skill.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they are excellent. In her only significant scene, Sienna Miller cuts down Mark with venom with the delivery of a single line. In just five minutes, Tatum had conveyed to me everything I needed to know about how Mark feels. Ruffalo is superb and subtle, with his key moment during one of duPont's many narcissistic self-chronicles. Redgrave owns the camera in each of her few scenes.<br/><br/>Bennett MIller's efforts are unparalleled. The performances he has received from his actors are incredible, there are too many perfect scenes to count, and Foxcatcher is his masterpiece. If this was his vision for Foxcatcher, then he has succeeded on every front."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","9","27 January 2015"," Great Performances, Disappointing Film
","Foxcatcher (2014) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Olympic gold-medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) receives a phone call ordered by billionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) who wants the wrestler to come to his home and form a wrestling team to compete in the 1988 Olympics. Soon Mark's brother David (Mark Ruffalo) is brought on as a coach but soon both brothers start to see that something isn't quite right with du Pont.<br/><br/>FOXCATCHER is without a question a very somber little picture and one that's incredibly depressing and rather hard to watch at times. It seems a lot of people are either finding it to be a masterpiece or praising the performances but finding the film itself flawed, which is the group I'm going to fall in. For the life of me I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie wanting to like it a lot more than I actually did. A good half hour after the movie had ended I was still debating with myself the qualities of the picture but after much thought I just felt there were way too many flaws for me to fully praise the picture.<br/><br/>The one thing that can be praised are the performances with Tatum actually stealing the show. I was really shocked to see how great he was here but he's got quite a bit of emotions to play and I thought he did them perfectly. Early on the character just strikes you as a rather dumb jock but slowly we start to see the emotional problems that this guy is suffering with. Tatum has no problems at pulling off these emotions and there's no doubt that his physical shape made him very believable as a wrestler. Ruffalo has always been an underrated actor and he too really gets to shine here, although his character doesn't come into more focus until near the end. As for Carell, he appears to be getting the majority of the credit and there's no doubt that he's excellent but the psychological nature of the performance doesn't really get to shine until the final twenty-minutes when the actor really nails the role. Just the look in his eyes and the way he carries himself is quite chilling.<br/><br/>As I said, I thought there were quite a few flaws with the film and of course what I didn't like about the picture is the same thing that most love. I really didn't care for the style that Bennett Miller brought to the picture. Again, this is one of the most somber movies I've ever seen and I don't mind the pale, cold and distant feel of the picture but at the same time the first eighty-minutes just seemed to add up to nothing much. The biggest problem I had is that it was all style and very little character development and even by the end of the movie I thought there were more unanswered questions about these characters. For the life of me I thought the development should have been a lot better. I thought the actors, especially Carell, could have been better used earlier in the picture but the actor doesn't get to shine until the end.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the picture is that it just moves along way too slow for its own good. Again, I understand what Miller was going for but I just didn't think it worked as well as it needed to be and I thought a lot of emotional was missing from the picture up until the ending, which I won't spoil. I think one could argue that the slowness at the start of the picture was meant to lead up to the shocking conclusion but to me the start just didn't work. Technically speaking the film features some great cinematography and editing but this here just can't overcome the flaws I had with the story and direction. FOXCATCHER features some great performances, which makes the film worth viewing but it's still a disappointment."

Mark gets on well with Dupont, he feels like John is his ''father'' and they just have a good relationship overall. Two thirds into the movie this relationship starts to fall upon itself and things start to get really messy. Dave disagrees on some things with Dupont, Mark's not training properly, plus Dave kind of steals Mark away from Dupont and ... yeah.<br/><br/>If you are fan of dark Nightcrawler-like movies with heavy atmosphere, I think this is a movie for you.

He creeps you out, but you can't stop watching.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum may be getting some flak, but I loved his performance. Everyone's saying that Steve made some major changes to his appearance, movements, speech, etc...but Tatum did just as much, in my opinion. The charismatic, confident leading hunk transformed into an awkward, quiet, slumped-over man for the role, and I loved it. He plays it so well and with a lot of depth. I don't know much about the actual person he's portraying, all I can speak on is the character in the movie, and I think he did a wonderful job. Honestly, I'm sad that he was not the one nominated for the lead role Oscar, but I understand why.<br/><br/>Everyone else was just as wonderful, of course. I'm not going to pick apart every role, but I can say that the acting was never an issue for me. I can't really say what I'd change, although I suppose it had a weird pace at times.

"rjsf96","10","6","12","10 January 2015"," Fuelled by Terrific Performances Foxcatcher is a Captivating Biopic
","Olympic wrestling would not usually be my top choice for a biopic. So it surprises me to say that Foxcatcher is one of the best and most compelling films that I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The true story upon which this film is based is the Olympic Wrestling Team – Foxcatcher. Mark Schultz is trained and brought to John Du Pont's grounds to compete in the 1988 Wrestling Olympics in Seoul, where he trains with a group and his brother Dave.<br/><br/>Earlier this year I saw the film 'The Theory of Everything'. I stated that Eddie Redmayne who played Stephen Hawking deserves to win an Oscar. After seeing 'Foxcatcher' it is my duty to retract that statement, as each of the three male actors work above and beyond to the best of their ability. Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo give career defining performances that are guaranteed to be remembered on their filmography.<br/><br/>Although Ruffalo is great, I feel that it is his performance that I gained the least out of as he is given much less screen time than the others and therefore less to do. That being said his performance here is on par with his best work – 'Zodiac'. Carell and Tatum are at the core of this film's success and contribute to perhaps why I love this film as much as I do. Their relationship is intriguing and as the film nears its last third the collective strain on it is tangible.<br/><br/>Carell was what I most feared; I felt before I saw this film that he is more suited to comedic roles and would not be able to accurately portray the innate creepiness of John Du Pont. Rest assured that he is absolutely astonishing, most of the time I forgot I was watching a film, at some points I felt like I was watching a documentary.<br/><br/>Now, Tatum he deserves an Oscar, in this film he keeps himself extremely restrained. You can tell from his face his thoughts and feelings; you can literally read his mind. He usually portrays characters that are well versed in the world of sports and yes he is in this film as well. But my, he is so subtle, to deny this man an Oscar would be to deny the sheer driving power of the film itself.<br/><br/>Many people it seems have taken issue with the films pacing. In all honesty, if Stanley Kubrick was still alive he could have directed it. Read into that what you will. However, this film relies on a bleak tone and I feel that the pacing compliments the film perfectly. If it was too fast then we would never get into the mind-set of the characters – thankfully we do! <br/><br/>If you pay any attention to cinematography you will find so much for your eyes to feast upon. Almost every image is imprinted on my mind – the truth is this movie won't leave me alone and I mean that in a positive way! <br/><br/>It is your duty to watch 'Foxcatcher' – it has three of the best performances I have seen from a film released in 2014. An enticing script, mind bogglingly great cinematography, an unbelievable third act and heart thumping music. Put into simple terms – deny yourself this film and you are denying yourself one of the best Biopics ever put to celluloid."

","The movie starts off by establishing the wrestler Mark Schultz's (Channing Tatum) sad state of affairs. The first day on screen consists of him giving a speech to elementary students, crunching ramen noodles into a bowl, and staring at a wall. Obviously, things went down hill after his gold metal at the 1984 Olympics (he and his brother both won golds as Mark mentions many times throughout the film). Then, as they say, everything changes when he gets a call from John du Pont (Steve Carell), a member of the Du Pont family. John offers Mark a place on his wrestling team on the titular farm. He speaks of being a patriot and what the nation should do for its wrestlers. Mark is obviously wooed by these statements. Since he and his brother, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), are close, he discusses the offer with him. Mark ultimately decides to join John du Pont on the farm.<br/><br/>I've known about this film since November of 2013 when they decided to postpone the release. A first, I wasn't exactly excited because the names behind it didn't thrill me. I'd never seen Channing Tatum in anything, Mark Ruffalo wasn't anybody but ""that guy who played the Hulk in The Avengers,"" and Bennett Miller wasn't a proved director in my eyes. On the other hand, I was a big fan of Steve Carell's because of The Office, but I wouldn't really call that a dramatic performance (at all). A month later, I saw Stranger Than Fiction and The Truman Show, and realized that a comedian can make a good transition to drama. Some could argue that he already did with Little Miss Sunshine. I then saw Tatum in 21 Jump Street and Ruffalo in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. My level of anticipation was raised.<br/><br/>Then I saw Foxcatcher.<br/><br/>Carrell took my expectations, threw them to the ground, and shot them three times. In other words, his acting blew me out of the water. When he was on screen, it wasn't Steve Carrell. It was John du Pont. He was John du Pont in looks and manner. I'd like to note that I haven't compared the real John du Pont and Foxcatcher's version nor have I seen much footage of John du Pont. Exact accuracy with John's mannerisms was not necessarily needed. What Carrell did was embody the character behind John du Pont: a disturbed, spoiled, mentally unstable man.<br/><br/>Even though I just praised Carrell's du Pont to the utmost degree, I believe Mark Ruffalo one- upped him. Ruffalo's Dave Schultz is a much more nuanced performance. His feelings toward a subject could still be identified even though their subtler than his counterparts'. That is not to say that Carrell's feelings were blatantly obvious. Furthermore, John du Pont's depiction benefited from this somewhat emotionally open outlook anyways because that is what type of character du Pont is. By saying that Ruffalo ""one-upped"" Carrell, I'm saying that Ruffalo's performance was more difficult to achieve because he had to hide his emotion to the characters around him but not to the audience.<br/><br/>Part of what makes this movie great is the relationship between the Schultz brothers. Dave basically raised Mark when they were younger, so they were very close. Conversations between the two of them felt very organic and dynamic. In the very first scene, the movie planted the seeds of Mark's resentment towards his brother because he felt that his brother was the one who lead him to everything he had achieved in life. He didn't feel independent in his achievements; everything he did owed to his brother. The movie built off of this inferiority complex. On top of that, Mark struggled with having only one talent (wrestling) which was overshadowed by others including his brother (""Dave's my brother. We both have golds."") If he wasn't the best at the only thing he was good at, he wasn't anything. He felt he found in John du Pont someone that appreciated his abilities. Channing Tatum successfully portrayed Mark's inward struggle and deterioration as a wrestler and a human being. John du Pont wanted both brothers to come to Foxcatcher Farm, but only Mark came, making du Pont aggravated and impatient because he was used to getting what he wanted and Dave denied him of his request. This made something he and Mark could relate over. The power struggle between Dave and du Pont, the brotherly relationship between Dave and Mark, and the strange semi-friendship, semi-mentorship between du Pont and Mark, increased tension among the trio. Two hours and ten minutes of Foxcatcher built on this tension until the haunting, chilling, and depressing finale in the last four minutes. It's worth staring at a blank wall for those two hours if you get to see those last four minutes.<br/><br/>All I have discussed in my review is the performances of three actors and one theme within this epic (yes, I used the word ""epic,"" and I don't use it often), haunting masterpiece. I didn't go into detail about Channing Tatum's performance, and I didn't even mention Vanessa Redgrave (du Pont's mother), Sienna Miller (Dave's wife), or the surprisingly-creative cinematography.<br/><br/>From the outside, Foxcatcher doesn't seen to have much going on. It might just seem like a slow-burning borefest filled with homoerotic wrestling scenes. Look inside and you'll find a carefully crafted and well-executed character study that truly understands its subjects and humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended | Award: CAUGHT THE FOX"
"blanbrn","8","6","12","11 December 2014"," Real life drama of tragedy brought to the screen just fine, as it shows how ego, passion and greed destroys friendship.
","Finally watched ""Foxcatcher"" and I for one was not aware that the film was based on a real life drama that ended tragic, I was to young to remember anyway when it was. You have the real life story in which director Bennett Miller brings to the screen just fine of the Olympic wrestling brother team of one Mark(Channing Tatum)and David Schultz(Mark Ruffalo)who are getting ready to train for the 1988 games in Seoul. And Mark is the younger up and coming stubborn guy who wants to escape out of the shadow of his older straight laced and wise older brother a family man husband and dad David. Oddly enough a strange millionaire makes his appearance that's one strange and lonely odd guy in John E. DuPont(in a wicked and odd transformation role for funny guy Steve Carell)and he lets both Schultz brothers train at his farm like estate and he even lets the guys along with other wrestlers share the estate. And John becomes a father like figure to Mark only slowly but for sure the ego of John takes over as the unlikely relationship was not meant to be as this millionaire lives in one strange world. Overall this film is a great showcase of real life greed, ego, compassion, and the need for friendship in a lonely world as it shows how a mixture of these issues lead to real life tragedy as ""Foxcatcher"" is one film that tears a little bit of your viewing heart."

"randbish","4","4","7","4 March 2015"," A Loser of a Movie
","Last night, I watched Bennett Miller's FOXCATCHER with great anticipation. As the credits rolled, I wondered how I could possible have spent two hours and fifteen minutes with the three primary characters and know little more about them than I did when the movie started? First, we meet these two, knuckle-dragging brothers, Mark and Dave Schultz. American heroes both, young men who have sacrificed their lives — and all the cartilage in their ears, evidently — to the sport of free-style wrestling. The two gold-medalist sibs hulk around, butting heads, and slapping each other like mountain gorillas as they go through their daily training routine.<br/><br/>Poor Mark. Eating Top Ramen in his Spartan apartment, scowling at the world outside like an orphaned Frankenstein's monster. But alas, his phone rings. The heir to a massive fortune summons the muscular misfit to a Pennsylvania mansion. Enter Steve Carell in his Oscar-nominated role of John DuPont. We discover — awkwardly — that DuPont wrote a book about birds ten years ago. Other than that, all we learn about this very creepy guy is that he's definitely plagued with a very perverse Mommy fixation. Oh, yeah, and he fancies himself a wrestling coach and a great patriot.<br/><br/>(Mommy, btw, is portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave, one of two fine actresses whose efforts are wasted here on vapid, thankless, ""female"" roles — the other being Sienna Miller, who portrays Dave Schultz's loyal better half.) <br/><br/>What we don't learn about DuPont is that he was responsible for discovering two-dozen rare species of birds, founded the Delaware Museum of Natural History, donated Villanova University's basketball facility, and figured heavily in establishing the pentathlon as an Olympic event. However, those inconvenient details might have distracted us from what director Bennett Miller evidently wanted to convey — that this DuPont dude was a complete whack job, who used his Foxcatcher Wrestling training facility to buy male friends with whom he could bond and party.<br/><br/>The in-and-out, off-and-on fraternal rivalry between Dave Schultz and his dim-witted, severely depressed younger bro might have been the heart of the film. Or, maybe, it might have been the wrestling competition. I don't know. Miller doesn't allow any of the characters to rise to the level of protagonist. They all simply fall in and out of love with one another, exploit one another, bring out the worst in one another, get angry, pout, sulk, etc. All the while, I'm sitting there wondering who I'm supposed to care about, trying to figure out why so much time is going by, while absolutely no tension builds.<br/><br/>What is the core of the story? Three ape men grapple for what? Then, Mark loses his last chance at gold. Because? Because DuPont, the guy who got him strung out on coke, insists on being in his corner? This big, tough, dominate athlete is too emotionally fragile to win under uncomfortable conditions? Mark's failure brings shame on Foxcatcher. He packs his UHaul, leaving big brother behind to coach the team — evidently for the next 8 years! Then, inadvertently, DuPont puts three bullets into Dave — right in front of helpless Mrs. Schultz and Foxcatcher's supposed head of security. ""You got a problem with me?"" DuPont queries Dave before firing. Not with you. No. With the screenwriters and the director. Yes.<br/><br/>What Miller and the screenwriters have neglected to show us is that DuPont had married and divorced over the course of the narrative. And, that he had bonded with another Foxcatcher wrestler, Bulgarian Valentin Yorkanov, to whom DuPont bequeathed 80% of his $200M personal estate. Did the Yorkanov relationship figure into Dave Schulz's murder? Or, maybe it had something to do with DuPont's addiction to the Bulgarian prescription drug scopolamine? But none of that stuff is shown on screen — in a 155 minute film! Even that John DuPont suffered from paranoid schizophrenia is not at all clear. All Bennett Miller allows us to see is a spoiled, friendless nut job, who can't stand to lose. And, that's what makes FOXCATCHER a loser of a movie."

Both Steve Carrel and Channing Tatum go miles outside there comfort zone and do a very good job. Carrel more so than Tatum. Tatum was just sorta quiet and didn't really act a lot but he played it cool and didn't do anything to make you not believe. Carrel on the other hand. wow i grew up watching this guy on the daily show, as brick Tatum from anchorman, or even almighty. always hilarious and light. i will never look at him the same again. In Fox Catcher he is nothing short of one creepy Mother trucker. an Oscar worthy performance no doubt.<br/><br/>Again mad props for casting. Mark Ruffalo is a great and bankable choice for any director to cast he was the shining star of this film for sure. He does a flawless job of portraying Tatum's brother role model and mentor in this movie. u really feel like he is his brother and you wish he was your big brother. he just came across as so honest and loving.<br/><br/>Not best picture this year i'm afraid, but 3 amazing performances i will never forget."

"chefmb-195-213748","9","7","15","29 December 2014"," A Beautiful Film about deconstructing the American Dream
","Ever since I saw the preview for Foxcatcher on television, I thought it would be a dark and intriguing film. Since the true story its based on, happened to end in tragedy itself. The films main character is Channing Tatum who plays Olympic Wrester Mark Schultz. From the very beginning, we get a clear sense of what kind of person Mark is, one who always seems to carry an extra load of pressure, and longing for a father figure. This is one of the reasons why its so easy for him to latch onto Jon Du Pont when they finally meet. Up until that point, we also meet Dave Schultz (played by Mark Ruffalo) and his family, Dave is a Wrestling trainer and coach at a local high school. Unlike Mark, Dave has a great personality, family and seems to be more passionate when it comes to the art of the sport. He also possesses the confidence that Mark needs when it comes winning a gold medal the second time. It becomes obvious as the movie progresses that the glitz and glamour of being a Olympic Gold Medalist isn't all that its cracked up to be. We are shown that Mark lives in poverty, making twenty dollar paychecks talking to elementary school students, and people barely can differentiate him from his brother Dave. This identity crisis propels Mark to head too Foxcatcher Farms when he receives a call from the estate of Jon DuPont( played by the great Steve Carell). It isn't until Mark meets Jon Dupont for the first time where they instantly form a bond between each other(Both consider themselves Patriots and want to make America the best country again). Jon asks Mark if he and Dave will come stay out at Foxcatcher Farms and train for the 88' Olympics, in which Mark agrees but says his brother can't be persuaded(Dave eventually comes there midway through film, because the pay offer is so good). Another major theme of the film is how wealth can make someone worse off than they originally were. In real life, Jon Dupont's family was wealthy eccentrics who had a huge stake in chemicals, oil and thoroughbred breeding among other things. It's also been documented that the early Dupont's all partook in incestry to keep the family blood line the same generation after generation. These factors and many other contribute to the eeriness of the Dupont character even more, and throughout the film we also get to meet Duponts mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave). She psychologically destroys Dupont's ambitions and wants, and we can see in many scenes how hard Jon tries to rekindle his relationship with her but fails miserably.. to the point of coaching a wrestling team when Dupont possessed little to none wrestling experience, often relying on his own wrestlers like Mark and Dave for advice.. Out of all the characters, Jon Dupont (Steve Carell) was definitely the most interesting anddisturbing to watch. By the end of the film though, you garner a lot of sympathy and sadness for Dave Schultz(Mark Ruffalo), because he was just trying to raise a family and live a normal life. You also feel for Mark Schultz as he loses his brother, throws the 88' olympics because his hatred for Jon Dupont had grown to extremes, and even in the end he is still a product of America, switching from wrestling to MMA. Everything about this film is different and great, the setting/locations are all fascinating, the history is interesting, the electric dialogue and tense scenes make up for the lack of violence or action because this is a deconstructive crime drama where the crime doesn't happen till the end.. The only two disappointments I had with the film was that there was no clarification when it came to Dupont hiding out in his home in a police standoff for 3 days after he killed Dave Schultz, we only see him getting taken out by the swat team after they get him outside. And the other thing is that Mark Schultz has spoken out about a few scenes being fictional, but its Hollywood, everything is used for dramatic effect. Great film none the less. One reason I think this film is classic and rewatchable is because you can close your eyes the whole movie and the score will take you on a story itself... 8.5/10."

","Right after I finished watching the gripping ""Foxcatcher"", I wrestled with the idea that it was a masterpiece. Well, maybe it's not a masterpiece, but it is really quite good. ""Foxcatcher"" is based on the true story of wrestling Olympic Champion brothers Mark & David Schultz, who joined Team Foxcatcher led & financed by multi-millionaire John Du Pont. Du Pont sees some chemistry in having the gullible Mark join his team. And then eventually the more stoic Dave joins the Foxcatching crew. The tragedy within this story is that the deranged Du Pont ended up murdering Dave Schultz; that was not a spoiler, its a true story so if you can't wrestle with that concept, don't blame me. Director Bennett Miller paints ""Foxcatcher"" as an icy psychothriller; which was fair enough due to its subject matter. Miller has proved again that when it's Miller time, the movies are not less filling. Steve Carrell's performance as Du Pont was a creepy of a performance you will see, but it was also quite brilliant. Channing Tatum delivers his best work in his career in his portrayal of Mark Schultz. And Mark Ruffalo keeps up his impressive thespian filmography with another worthy performance, here playing Dave Schultz. ""Foxcatcher ""is not the feel good movie of the year, but its power is sturdy. So it won't kill you to get out of your foxhole and give ""Foxcatcher"" a try. ***** Excellent"
"misterphilipj","3","9","21","10 February 2015"," Bland, boring, overrated, misrepresentation of the truth, you might fall asleep.
","Bad movie, here's why (spoilers):<br/><br/>Reasons being are primarily because the acting was too limited to the real life characters. Channing was shy and quiet and seemed to be trying to be someone else rather than just act, Ruffalo had this pen writing all over his hands the whole time, and Carrell had a nose the size of a peacock's and acted very creepy. So overall they were trying to make the characters too much non-fictional, a clone of their persona from 1988. <br/><br/>It gets worse, because despite the directors trying to make the characters exactly like their real life counterparts, they completely distorted the truth of the situation, and painted Du Pont as too much as a drug driven demon. In real life he was a lifelong benefactor to the arts, discovered 10 species of birds that no one previously knew existed, and donated all of his money to charity and to a wrestler friend when he died. To put the icing on the cake, in the movie it seems as if Carrell came after Ruffalo because Ruffalo allowed his brother Channing to move away. They didn't indicate that any time had passed, and they also made sounds of young children at the time of his murder. His kids would no longer have been that young. This is because the murder took place in 1996, EIGHT YEARS AFTER the loss of Channing at the Olympics. Very inconsistent that the movie would bend the truth like this, while at the same time obsessing over making the characters so much like the real people. <br/><br/>Additionally the movie was bland and boring. It kept me watching, but I felt like I was watching the history channel analyzing an event that I was not interested in, being hosted by some creepy old guy who walked strangely. It seemed like more of a documentary than any sort of crime, drama, or thriller. At no point did I get nervous, sad, empathetic, happy, etc... no emotion from me at all the whole time watching, just yawns. Yawn, yawn, yawn. <br/><br/>I had a hard time understanding why this movie hasn't done so well at the box office, before I watched it. Solid cast, marketed well, and a familiar story for those born before early 80's. It didn't bomb, but it hasn't made it's money back, although there isn't information available about how it's done overseas. After watching it and seeing what a terrible movie it was, I now know. I suspect that the producers knew it was terrible, so rather than releasing it as a nationwide release, they gave a few little screenings at film festivals to gain some hype, then probably paid off or befriended a few others to say it was an Oscar contender, then soon enough it got enough interest to make some cash back. If they started with a nationwide release I think it would have done worse than Pluto, the biggest bomb of all time."
"anteksw","10","5","10","3 February 2015"," An Exceptionally Haunting Character Study
","Over three weeks have passed since I viewed this film at the cinema, and to this day it has been continuously on my mind.<br/><br/>'Foxcatcher' was one of my most anticipated films of 2014; primarily being hooked by the plot synopsis as well as the cast and director involved. The trailers further heightened both my excitement and expectations, surprisingly I wasn't feeling sceptical about actors mostly involved in comedy portraying characters in a serious film like this. In fact, I was pleased to see Carell taking on such a challenging role, and hopefully expanding his versatility as an actor in terms of portraying another antagonist of sorts since 'The Way Way Back'.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this film utterly exceeded my expectations, despite being dissimilar to what the trailer indicated. I was expecting a decent drama with swift pacing and strong performances, instead, I was swept up in a realistic character study which felt strangely atmospheric due to its overriding gritty tone. One of the reasons why the film stuck in my mind as much as it did, was due to the way it 'felt' and left me feeling afterwards; it was as if I simply 'observed' three people's lives. This was achieved by the slow pacing, long takes showcasing REAL emotion and the minimal use of a soundtrack allowing me to effectively experience and take in the chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>The performances did not disappoint either, they were phenomenal and according to me achieved exactly what was required in order for the plot to feel enticing. Firstly, I believe Steve Carell knocked it out of the park; his performance genuinely felt creepy and haunting, merely his presence and figure expression in a given scene evoked a sense of ceaseless dread. Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum equally delivered, their performances felt truly genuine; displaying intensity both mentally and physically in a flawless manner. I personally believe all three performances were equally worthy of an Oscar, both Ruffalo and Carell certainly deserved their nominations.<br/><br/>To conclude, the wait for this film was definitely worthwhile. Although some people may find the slow pacing and gritty tone distasteful, I found that it helped the film and character development maintain engaging throughout. In addition to this, the film looked excellent, the cinematography was alluring and effectively further helped to set the tone. I'm giving this film a strong 9,7 as it provides an exceptionally haunting and enticing character study, and thus essentially achieves everything it strives for as a compelling biopic."

","Bennett Miller uses the true story of John du Pont to examine how patriotism can be used to advance and to conceal corruption. The story operates on two levels, family psychology and the dynamic of the United States. <br/><br/>In the familial aspect John (Steve Carrell) chafes to emerge from his mother's disregard. A patrician, played by the iconic Brit Vanessa Redgrave, she has a passion for horses and disdains of her son's ""low"" interest in wrestling. Her disdain only drives him lower. There is no mention of his father, just a reference to his ancestors making the du Ponts America's richest family by cashing in on the nation's need for weaponry. John seduces his prize prospect Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) by sympathizing with his putative need to escape the shadow of his older brother and trainer Dave (Mark Ruffalo). As in the school assembly scene, Mark is the substitute for his more heroic brother. John uses Mark to get to his real prey, Dave.<br/><br/>The titles play against historic images of the British foxhunt. In naming his wrestling team Foxcatcher John aspires to develop an American glory that would match the older British imperialism. The irony is that both are blood sports, with not much virtue or morality to distinguish either. When his mother visits a training session John takes over the coaching to impress her with his knowledge and leadership of men. He fails. As a boy he was disillusioned to learn his mother had been paying a boy to be his friend. He has ever since tried to prove to her his worth. Where strangers might be impressed by his claims to being an ornithologist, philatelist and philanthropist, she denies him any affection or respect. When she dies he has lost his motivation and abandons all restraint. He turns her stable of world-class valuable horses loose into the wilds. He has already ruined Mark by turning him onto cocaine and booze and reduced him from disciplined wrestler to a stooge promoting du Pont's image. He has made the chaste stud his bitch.<br/><br/>The sterile opulence and history of the du Pont estate contrasts to the exuberance and warmth of Dave with his family, however seedy their accommodation. Dave's wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) is the only proper mother and woman we see in this film. Where du Pont prioritizes his self-aggrandizement through his wrestlers, Dave emphasizes his role as father and brother over all else. He saves his Sundays for them. Having destroyed Mark with his ostensible friendship and intimacy, du Pont's final madness is an assault on the family closeness he never experienced. <br/><br/>When du Pont adopts his nickname, Eagle or Golden Eagle, he pretends to a male camaraderie he has never known. Friends invent nicknames. The intimacy of the wrestlers' constant embracing and physical expressions of support is a parody of affection and friendship, that easily tips into violence and bloodshed, even when the grapplers are loving brothers. The first wrestling match we see seems especially homoerotic because only later do we learn the men are brothers. <br/><br/>But the Eagle image also makes du Pont an embodiment of America. Of course, the du Pont name has come to connote American militarism and destructive chemicals. Carrell plays du Pont with a predatory bird's beak that is a harsh parody of the Brit's patrician schnoz. He often freezes in a lofty steely stare. When John isn't claiming that his ""coaching"" makes him a model father and mentor, he's disguising his vain and corrupt activity as trying to revive America's status in the world. His patriotism is a fraud. <br/><br/>John clearly buys off his opponent in the over-50 tournament. He effectively buys control of the US Olympics wrestling team. He not only uses cocaine but urges it on his filial charge, Mark. Yet he still claims to be a role model coaching other young role models for America's youth to follow. In his vanity documentary he climactically uses the tribute footage of the broken and rejected Mark. Carrell's du Pont is a black caricature of that bromide, ""family values."" What makes the du Pont tragedy so current is its reflection of the Republicans' paralyzing the government and damaging the nation's health and economy in blatant self-interest. On the national plane as on the psychological, a profound insecurity results in macho posturing and self-destruction.<br/><br/>The epilogue suggests a bit of a happy ending. du Pont died in jail. And Mark, whom we last see reduced to the circus of commercial all-in wrestling, is now teaching clinics in Oregon. Mark has become the role model his vile mentor only professed to be."

Mark Ruffalo was great he is the only one in the film who honestly for sure is getting an Oscar nomination. Jon Du Point was a strange, insane and tormented man who thought he could help America soar again, but in a violent way. Mark Schultz himself says the film is mostly false and well it's a movie, not exactly always fully true.

This is a great film about what it takes to be a champion in the sports arena. It is quite a quiet film in the sense there is not much dialogue. But there things going on beneath the surface that are sinister. Steve Carrell as the coach i have never seen him do such an interesting and chilling performance. They way he delivers dialogue and carries himself in this film is scary. Channing Tatum is also effective as his protégé. Also Mark Ruffalo as Tatum's older brother is great as well. This film has dark moments and some great moments. There are chilling and scary moments as well. This is very well directed by Bennet Miller who did Capote and Moneyball. I highly recommend this film for film buffs who want to see something a little different. 5 stars"

"Red-Barracuda","6","3","5","16 October 2017"," Emotionally cold sports-drama but with an amazing performance from Steve Carrell
","There have been a few critically praised professional fighter movies in recent years such as The Wrestler (2008), The Fighter (2010) and Warrior (2011). Foxcatcher is another in this line of serious-minded sports-dramas, except this may be the most downbeat of them all. Unlike the others, this one is also a docudrama biopic based on real characters and events which surrounded Team Foxcatcher, which was the brainchild of billionaire John du Pont who used his money to gather the American wrestling team to live and train on his estate in preparation for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The two most prominent members of this team were the Olympic gold-medal winning brothers Dave and Mark Schultz. The story is primarily told from the latter's perspective, as he enters the weird world of du Pont.<br/><br/>I wasn't in the least bit aware of anything to do with this true story when I watched this. It is certainly a very odd set of events that is for sure and one which does justify a movie. It does have to be said though that this is one of those films which adopts a very emotionally distant tone, which means that it is hard getting as involved with the characters as maybe we really should be. It's so overwhelmingly bleak and humourless that it is difficult to fully enjoy to be perfectly honest. But it is still an interesting story overall though, which results in a murder that I frankly did not predict in the least. The du Pont character is certainly a bizarre one. He lives with his mother in a huge mansion but seems to suffer from some social condition which makes him extremely odd in one-to-one conversations and interactions. Despite his highly sheltered life he improbably has a cocaine habit, as well as an unusual obsession with professional wrestling. It has to be said that Steve Carell is quite brilliant as this awkward character, in a performance which is the chief selling point of the movie overall. He completely immerses himself in the role and the result is what you could describe as truly proper acting. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are also very good as the two Shultz brothers but this is really Carrell's movie overall, given how outstanding he was. The film as a whole is an impressive enough one which tells an interesting story but its thoroughly downbeat execution means it's one which keeps its distance from you and, as such, it's a movie which is easier to admire than to love."
"jkbonner1","10","6","14","3 January 2015"," A modern tragedy
","In spite of dealing with the sport of wrestling, this movie is not primarily an action movie. And like any movie it must rely on acting, directing, and script. Foxcatcher is no exception, and all three are outstanding, especially the acting, which is superb.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it is above all the story of three men: Dave Schultz, Mark Schultz, and John Eleuthère (aka the Golden Eagle) du Pont, heir to the immense Du Pont fortune. Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), an American Olympic and world champion freestyle wrestler and a seven-time World and Olympic medalist, is the most normal of the three with a loving wife and two children whom he adores. Dave is a good man and an outstanding wrestling coach. And in addition to his family, Dave sincerely loves his younger brother, Mark (Channing Tatum), also an Olympic medalist (1984). Both shared a difficult childhood that left its effect on both of them and Dave watches out for Mark and is concerned about him. And Mark admits Dave was the only real friend he had in childhood.<br/><br/>Mark is the more problematic of the two brothers. Not terribly articulate or knowledgeable about the world, unmarried and going nowhere in his career, he receives a phone call from a man working for John du Pont. Du Pont wants Mark to come and train at his wrestling training center on his Foxcatcher Farm in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where he is to be groomed as a top wrestler for the upcoming 1988 Olympics. Mark accepts the invitation, an action that sets in motion everything that transpires all the way to its inevitable dark end. Like a stack of dominoes falling down one after another until none are left standing.<br/><br/>But of the three men John du Pont (Steve Carell) is by far the most problematic. If neuroses took the form of porcupine quills, du Pont would have looked like a two-legged porcupine. The nice thing about Foxcatcher is it doesn't shove du Pont's neuroses down your throat. They are suggested by subtle hints in body language, dialogue, scene, and action, and Carell gives an absolutely amazing performance in his rendition of this deeply troubled man. And Vanessa Redgravc gives an outstanding cameo rendition of John du Pont's manipulative mother, Jean du Pont.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that John du Pont destroyed both Dave Schultz and Mark Schultz in his vain ambition to be mentor, leader, brother, and father to the wrestlers training at his wrestling training center. A man who expected his money to control everything, it couldn't control his own hidden desires that ultimately destroyed him too.<br/><br/>A strong connection exists between this story and Ancient Greece. Not only does the story unfold like a real-life Greek tragedy, but wrestling matches played a prominent part in the games of the Ancient Greek Olympics.<br/><br/>As an aside, Carell is known for his comedy, but he should consider more serious roles because he clearly has the talent to pull them off very effectively. I'd love to see what he could do with Julius Caesar.<br/><br/>10/10"
"scottjohnson7896","9","6","14","21 December 2014"," Engrossing and Tragic Character Study (Raging Film Reviews)
","I don't think anybody in their right minds would have suspected that Steve Carell— someone who is generally know for charming and comedic roles—could completely destroy his typecast persona with a force so tremendous that he is left beyond recognition. Nonetheless Carell delivers a performance that even most dramatic actors cannot muster.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher, directed by Bennett Miller (Moneyball,) follows the intersecting lives of two Olympic wrestlers and an eccentric and bizarre millionaire who wants nothing more than to train a wrestling team to compete and win in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In what is a primarily performance driven film, we are also propelled forward by the ever-lingering notion that nothing good can possibly come out of having three utterly obsessed and perfectionist characters crossing paths in their attempts to attain gold. The intense psychological moments regarding the characters all have an underlying feeling of a slow- burn thriller in which the bomb can explode at any possible moment resulting in tragic consequences.<br/><br/>Mark Shultz, played by Channing Tatum, has lived in the shadow of his brother, David, (Mark Ruffalo) for far too long. They are both gold-winners who are striving to have another go at the Olympics. Mark is propositioned to come to an estate in Pennsylvania to meet John du Pont, played absolutely brilliantly by Carell, to start and train a team to take to the Olympics. From the very start, du Pont is creepy and strange. He is unapologetically patriotic, believing that most of the nation has lost its pride, and he wants to bring it back. His mother who occasionally roams the estate has never been impressed by her sons actions, so we add another layer to his desires to be successful. Du Pont and Mark need each other because they both need the same thing: recognition. Of course things are never quite as easy as they seem and soon we begin to realize that the initially welcoming and generous du Pont will stop at nothing to get what he wants. The film has so many layers of motivation and desires, and it is fantastically written so as to allow the audience to take out of it what they want and to interpret in their own ways.<br/><br/>Carell thrusts himself into his character so fully that we can only wonder why we never suspected he had it in him. He is not at all his usual character, and that is a very good thing. He is manipulative, delusional, and at times purely strange. Adding to that is a fantastic makeup job that leaves Carell visually unrecognizable with a hideously-long nose and age-enhancing make up. We never know quite how he is going to act; his unpredictability grows as the film reaches its horrifyingly-shocking climax and we do not if or when he is going to snap. Carell manically drags the audience along with little moments of insanity that only promise something far worse than we actually expect. He is very deservedly getting recognition for his performance, and one can only hope he attempts to do more films like these because he really outdoes anything he has ever done before with this role.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum also succeeds in shedding his non-serious skin in a truly devastating and brutal performance of someone who has lived their life in someone else's shadow and needs to break free. His desperateness for this is what drives him so easily into the arms of du Pont. The amount of stress and anger he is exposed to nearly breaks him. His desire to win is nothing short of heartbreaking because of the extreme behaviors he does in order to do so. Every loss makes it that much worse for him and his relationship with du Pont who's already unpredictable behavior makes us fear for anything but a win. Ruffalo also maintains his consistently good acting as the brother who gets brought in despite having all he really needs. He has a family, a good job, and he is happy with just training his brother. Once he gets thrown into the mix, the dynamics between him and du Pont start to create a whole new vibe for the film—one that adds to the already anxious tone.<br/><br/>In the end, Foxcatcher boasts some of the best and game- changing performances of the year. From Steve Carell's departure from his most well-known roles—and genres for that matter—to Channing Tatum's stellar performance in one of his very few dramatic roles, and to Mark Ruffalo who is fantastic as always, the film is nothing short of an acting frenzy where nobody tries to steal the spotlight and everybody goes all-out in crafting some of the most vivid, terrifying, and real characters of the year. Add to that the psychologically enthralling story with the feeling of imminent tragedy and the result is a brilliant character study in which Bennett Miller pulls out the best performances out of actors playing characters at their worst. Foxcatcher will leave you stunned and amazed. Go check it out if you can.<br/><br/>for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"

","This is a story I was not familiar one. It is about John E. Dupont and his quest to come from under the scrutiny of his family and find love and approval from his mother. He does this by seeking to build and coach the ultimate wrestling team. The Schultz brothers were already known in wrestling circles but DuPont gave them the platform to get better. What happens in the course of the movie is interesting. It shows how money and all the material things can give a person the inner grit to win. Steve Carrell portrays Dupont in the perfect manner and is break form his comedic type he usually portrays. Channing Tatum in portraying the brother Mark also pushes the envelope as he accurately paints the solitary life of an athlete the pressures to perform and win. A good movie based on a memoir by Mark Schultz."
"jdkraus","9","5","11","25 January 2015"," A great moviefalls a little short on the ending
","While ""Foxcatcher"" is inspired by real people and events the film's roots are in a psychological examination of its lonesome and disturbed characters. Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, the 1984 Gold Medalist in Men's Wrestling. Going nowhere with employment and training, he receives a chance of a lifetime from being recruited by John E du Pont (Carrel), a reserved and awkward multi-millionaire, who wants America to win the gold again in the 1988 Olympics. At Du Pont's mother's farm, he organizes the new US wrestling team for the International games. <br/><br/>Their relationship becomes the basis of this film and how it rises and then ultimately deflates. From the first five minutes we are introduced to Du Pont, he is presented as a wealthy, charismatic individual with a peculiar way of speaking and an even more peculiar nose. Progressively, we get to see the type of man Mark has befriended as he spirals out of control, engaging in drug abuse, guns, and irrational behavior. Carrel has performed a role at first glance may seem hard to swallow. However, he portrays his character in such a style that it is truly terrifying. Beneath the hours of make-up, he can display absolute nothingness, uncontrollable rage, and even pure narcissism without even speaking. Director Bennett Miller relies heavily on non-verbal scenes, allowing the silence between the actors on camera to create tension and intriguing interactions. This is a tough accomplishment, and he hits it head-on at every point. <br/><br/>The screenwriters supply the actors with straight-to-the-point, yet brilliant dialog, and the cast carry the weight of their characters superbly. Who could have imagined that Channing Tatum or even Steve Carrel could deliver such vulnerable and sophisticated characters? Mark Ruffalo is extremely limited in screen time but he is up to par with his leading co-stars as Mark's caring brother. The only setback ""Foxcatcher"" has is the ending. The first 100 minutes are electrifying and engaging, but the final 20-30 minutes kind of meander and depict a series of events that feel woven together. Too much of Carrel and Tatum looking depressed make a snail's pace for the final act. I wanted more character interaction and an actual conclusion that ties in with the violent tragedy of Dave Schultz's murder. It merely happens and Du Pont is arrested. No trial. No final face-to-face showdown between Mark and Du Pont. Not even a moment where Mark mourns his brother. Nor is there a clear motive for Du Pont's crime. As a viewer, the ending is quite cold and rather withholding. <br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is a great movie. I would definitely buy it when the Blu-Ray hits retail stores. Yet I don't think it is as great as some of the other movies released in 2014."
"lesleyharris30","9","5","11","21 January 2015"," Interesting True Story with a Thrilling Atmosphere Throughout,
","Foxcatcher is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.Its based on a true story,one that I never knew about,and didn't bother learning anything about it so I would be surprised with what was to come,and it certainly kept me at the edge of my seat.Though the movie isn't a thriller for the majority,there is a constant creepy and unpleasant atmosphere throughout,you can tell that something big is coming.This atmosphere is mostly conveyed by Steve Carell,who delivers an absolutely terrific performance that is nothing like what he's done previously,he is a complete creep and it is certainly uncomfortable watching this character,but in a very enjoyable way,it was amazing to see a man who played Michael Scott and Brick Tamland now take on such a very different character,and do so with such grace.Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also do an amazing job,you can tell in many scenes that they got in to these characters as much as they possibly could,their mannerisms and speech are very different and both deliver one of their finest performances to date.I do feel like the movie struggled a bit to find their leading man,which was a bit of an issue,for a while it was mainly Tatum,but it stopped following him and jumped to Carell a bit and then to Ruffalo briefly,this isn't a huge issue but I felt like it should have focused on one character as the leading role and not jump around characters.A dramatic and well acted movie that I will certainly watch again,I would recommend Foxcatcher to anyone looking for a good biography or drama. <br/><br/>Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is finally getting the recognition as a wrestler he dreamed of after getting in to business with Team Foxcatcher,led by the very successful John du Pont (Steve Carell),but all may not be as good as it seems. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Steve Carell Worst Performance: Anthony Michael Hall"
"joe_mckeown","9","5","11","16 January 2015"," Oscar worthy film.
","This film to say the least, was phenomenal. Personally, i feel that the little dialogue used was key to the feel of them film. The fact it was so quiet, without use of atmospheric soundtrack in most of the film, gave the film such a tense atmosphere so I feel that Bennett Miller successfully made use of little dialogue. If you as a viewer never took Steve Carell seriously, prepare to change your opinion on this fantastically versatile actor. If you watch real footage of Mr Du Pont, Steve Carell portrays the eccentric billionaire fabulously. Mark Ruffalo has always been an actor that I feel is very 'samey' in the majority of his films, but this also was a career defining performance. Same goes for Channing. He really portrays the pain and psychological pain that Mark went through to be the best. Perfect piece of filmmaking that everyone needs to see."
"Franco_Strydom","10","5","11","15 January 2015"," A truly well-crafted film with acting that deserves a standing ovation.
","In terms of a story ""Foxcatcher"" (Miller 2014) doesn't really have a lot to work with at first glance. It's a story about a – in some or another way – down and out sports person who has to rise to the challenge, or not. These are stories that have been around the block with pretty much any sport you can think of, but ""Foxcatcher"" is not another one of those films. This 'straight forward' narrative is laced with character content making what could easily have been dull or boring scenes informative and engaging. The plot generally develops the way you expect it to, until the moment where what you should have seen coming catches you - and the lady somewhere behind you - off guard with a yelp. There are two elements of 'setup' for important things to come in this film and they are both done wonderfully. In retrospect you realize that the script and director were giving you a hint but in the moment of the scene there is no reason for you to suspect it; and that is how a setup is done correctly. As mentioned, the acting is praiseworthy and I fully support the freshly released 87th Academy Award nominations for Steve Carell (Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role) and Mark Ruffalo (Best Performance of an Actor in a Supporting Role). Both these actors performed well above what we've come to expect from them and that does not exclude Channing Tatum, who embodies the physicality of the screen character of Mark Schultz remarkable well. Besides the obvious credit going to the actors, Director Bennett Miller also deserves his nomination for the 'Best Achievement in Directing' Oscar as he created an environment and world that made everything believable. Not for one second did I question the location, the time, the characters, their responses – and there were some out of the ordinary responses - or the action(s) around their lives. Miller and his crew put so much attention in the detail without losing sight of the big picture which is remarkable (here's to hoping the 'Best Directing' award from the Cannes Film Festival is a predictor for the Oscars). The cinematography was clean, precise and functional. The framing of certain moments and scenes were powerful but the camera never drew attention to itself and its art form, which in the case of a dramatic film like ""Foxcatcher"" is a very good thing. The sound however, drew my attention, but in a good way. The quality of the audio work in this film is beyond impressive. They used silence like very few films do, they used music and scoring sparsely which made the moments where there was scoring more effective. As a technical whole I think there is little that could have been done to improve this film. Cinematographer, Greig Frasera and his team, along with the substantial sound department did great work. ""Foxcatcher"" is well rounded in every facet, dramatic, beautiful, engaging, and with a powerful, unexpected climatic moment; a worthwhile film experience."

","Now this movie is getting a lot of hype. Particularly because of Steve Carell's performance, and it is career defining. It's downright creepy. I mean it gives me chills just thinking about it. Most people are saying he will get likely nominated for an Oscar. He might and if he does it will probably be for lead actor (since that's what category he's been nominated for mostly in this role). However, Channing Tatum playing Mark Shcultz is technically the lead role. Tatum did a fantastic job, definitely my favorite performance from him since now we can see him doing comedy and serious dramas. It's the same for Carell's performance, but he getting more notice because he is a comedy actor doing a serious role so it is more understandable why Carell is getting more buzz. However, I do think Carell's performance was the best in the film. Mark Ruffalo also did a good job! He's definitely an actor I would like to see more of. I hope he eventually wins an Oscar because he is just so damn good at what he does. All of these actors deserve Oscar nominations for this movie, and the movie would be completely different if they weren't in this movie. Unfortunately, Tatum will most likely not get any nominations.<br/><br/>Now I did not know anything about what actually happened in real life with these people. I did not do any research on the people and the story because I just wanted this movie to be a surprise. I won't spoil what happens because you might be in my shoes where you didn't know anything about these events. The movie does try to explain what happened and according to many people, nobody really knows why this happened. It really tries to show emotion on why this happened, but it wasn't really explained. I mean after looking through the whole movie, I can sort of see why this happened (I'm not saying I know why, I'm just assuming), but the movie could have shown a better way a showing these emotions and character motivations, because we really don't know what happened, this movie just tried to give a good explanation of it.<br/><br/>I did like the direction of this film. Some people say it is awfully slow, but I disagree. This might only be because I didn't know anything about Foxcatcher, so I was just intrigued with what happens. I can see why people thought it was slow, and who knows, maybe it will be slower the next time I see it, but I was just fascinated with it. My complaint about this is that I wish there were maybe 10 more minutes. The ending was just abrupt. Also it is well shot and the music is very enjoyable. It had a creepy vibe but it was just well written and very calm/relaxing. I'm hoping this soundtrack will get released soon.<br/><br/>I've waited over a year for this movie and I'm glad I was not disappointed. Performances from all three actors are Oscar worthy. Carell's performance just gave me chills from beginning to end. It is a very well shot film with great music as well. I just wish there was a bit more after the climax, because I was so intrigued with the story. Also since we really don't know what happened, the movie has a struggle of expressing some character emotion and motivation. Despite that, Foxcatcher is well made dark/creepy film that gave me chills and kept me fascinated from start to finish."

","Is this movie bad? Not really. The pace is good. It build the suspense that I anticipated. The acting is as expected from these cast. There's enough wrestling by main characters that shows they know what they're doing. It successfully shows the thirst of approval by John du Pont from his mother.<br/><br/>Then, why such a low score? Promoting misconception and there's a lot. There's several that I can overlook like they don't show the timeline correctly, they don't show truthfully the hallucination experienced by John, they wrongfully shows how John was captured.<br/><br/>But what I can't stand is they have the guts to portrays Mark as having a gay relationship with John and he suffered from Mark's departure as in a couple after a breakup. Real Mark is literally against this that he brought this to the director's attention on Twitter.<br/><br/>So my advice to you, if you wanna watch this, don't google the fact after watching this movie. Just watch it as it is. Overall, 7/10 for the movie and 1/10 for misconception."

","Brilliant performance by the supporting Cast, a intriguing true story, but has a very slow tempo that makes this film feel like its more then 4 hours long.<br/><br/>Let me first say, i was not a fan of Tatum in the film. There, he often broke character, and you can see that he wanted to break out a smile half the time he was on screen. Also the fact that he just kept on pushing his lower jaw out and slightly squinting his eye brows, didn't change the fact that he spoke and had all of his own mannerisms. His only good performance was in the hotel scene, where he was breaking down, but even then we didn't see his face.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was by far the best actor! He stole the film with his excellent performance. Just look at the way he walked, carried his body in this film compared to Avengers. Look at his mannerisms, his little personal character traits, this is was great acting is. his Nominations for Oscars was well deserved.<br/><br/>Steve Carell was also great in the film, although he did have a lot of prosthetic over his face, he still came across as the Golden Eagle rather then Carell playing the Coach. I can not say, and will not say that he was better then Mark, because he wasn't. But he did demonstrate that he has a variety of acting abilities in this film.<br/><br/>Now as for the film, and what i believe was the reason why this film is a 5/10. The story was interesting, and is based on the real events surrounding John du Pont and the Schultz brothers, but as a film, it felt at most to be dragging on. Not Much was happening, the tension was building very, very slow. and makes you look on your watch to see how much of time has passed. The not so subtle direction of suggestions of some kind of relationship between John and Mark, just felt awkward and pushed down the viewers throat.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that i did want to walk away from the film, but only stayed to watch more of Mark's brilliant acting and Carell's great performance. Now i know some might say, this is not an entertainment popcorn flick, and that's fine, but if i can sit and watch 12 angry men all day on repeat and not get bored. Then i should do the same for this. Not feel like ""When is this going to end"""

As shown here it starts off with manipulating the victim by dangling a carrot in front of them while showing charitable kindness in much the same way as giving candy to a child . ""Why didn't the victim complain ? "" you ask ? Well here in Britain people were making complaints to the authorities about philanthropist oddball TV presenter Jimmy Savile and the authorities didn't want to know ""Anymore of these lies and you'll find yourself in trouble . Jimmy Savile wouldn't do that ,,,or Rolf Harris ... or Stuart Hall"" in other words when you've a no one accusing a someone , especially a patriotic multi-millionaire then no one is going to listen to the no one . I also recently read an article on sexual abuse in music schools which is probably far more common than the constant court cases indicate . The victim gets brainwashed they can't succeed without the abusers help same as victims of paedophile priests think they can't enter the kingdom of Heaven without that priest's guidance . Let's also not forget The Stanford Experiment where people are so easy to comply to being victims when they're abused by those holding authority <br/><br/>This is a well made depressing film on a topic that is still taboo in many quarters . The problem is such a weighty hard hitting subject means it's all rather difficult to like in any way a fact that it picked up a lot of Oscar noms but went home empty handed and once had a IMDb average vote of 7.8 which has crashed down 7.1 . It is a very difficult watch and now that I've seen it I doubt if I'll be watching it again . You have been warned"

","I saw Foxcatcher months ago, I went to see it with very little idea of what it was about, I knew that it was based on a tragic true story and stared Steve Carell, Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo, other than that I knew nothing more and that's how it should be if you want to see this film.<br/><br/>Once I saw the movie I was baffled, it is undeniable that the performances are brilliant, the three leads brought their A game. It's a very psychological film, which means you should see it rested and ready to think, you have to pay attention to the nuances and the progression of the characters. It's not delivered on a silver platter, as a matter of fact it's a very solemn film, very simple with no tricks.<br/><br/>I recognize that the performances are mind-blowing, the story is very interesting but boy I was bored. There are a lot of long silences, I mean long, it works for the psychological drama that it is and I get that it helps set up the tone and pace but it's slightly too much for me. The same goes for the cold, bleak, chilling atmosphere, it suits the movie well and makes total sense but I was not into it. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher has all of the right quality ingredients for such a story but maybe, just maybe there are slightly too much of the quality stuff. It also definitely did not help that I wanted to pee the whole time but I did not have the amazing experience most people seem to have had. <br/><br/>@wornoutspines"
"ajfdavie","9","2","3","9 March 2015"," One of the best American movies I've seen in a long time
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A gripping, bizarre yet intriguing story. A film about obsession, competition, conflict and loyalty, with a strong message regarding the often isolating effect that money can have and what is, at times, the ugly reality of the American Dream. Five-star cast, superb direction and beautifully shot.<br/><br/>It is so refreshing to see a relatively ""mainstream"" American movie that is so well made. Unlike most Hollywood trash (about as subtle as a sledgehammer), this movie was wonderfully understated. It moved at a welcome, slow pace which paid respect to the passage of time. Dialogue was often sparingly used (to great effect). All of the scenes, whether stunning landscape shots or choreographed wrestling sequences, were beautifully and tastefully filmed.<br/><br/>The characters were so strong; well-crafted and thoughtfully presented. The acting was uniformly superb. Most impressively of all, much of the character development was conveyed via body language, rather than through dialogue. Right from the word go, one had such a strong sense of what each character was about; the surly, intense and hunched over Mark (Tatum), the caring, supportive Dave (Ruffalo) and the weird, unbalanced du Pont (Carell).<br/><br/>All three chief actors were excellent, but special praise must go to Carrell for his brilliant depiction of the eccentric, unhinged du Pont. Money talks, and there is no finer illustration of this than du Pont - a man who has every material object he could possibly desire yet pathetically (and unsuccessfully) craves the approval of those around him. Instead, he only succeeds in making everyone he comes into contact with immediately ill-at-ease, all the while understanding that they need to stay on the good side of the man who will help them realise their ambitions, albeit in a grandiose and self-gratifying manner. The dynamic between du Pont and the film's other characters was fascinatingly, and exceptionally, conveyed.<br/><br/>Sure, the directors presumably took some liberties with the re-telling of events as they actually happened, but what movie ""based on a true story"" doesn't? I generally take all movies of this kind with a pinch of salt.<br/><br/>I warmly recommend this movie. A thoughtful and beautifully constructed take on a unique, strange and ultimately tragic tale."
"tomgillespie2002","9","2","3","2 March 2015"," An unsettling analogy of modern America
","When it comes to depicting a real figure caught up in real events, the one aspect that movie's struggle with is really getting to the heart of it's character. Commonly, these characters are larger than life, and it takes a truly talented actor to bring them to life and an intelligent script to dig beneath their skin. Director Bennett Miller seem to have the magic touch. His three features have all been based on true-life stories. Philip Seymour Hoffman brought Truman Capote to life in Capote (2005), to the point where you believed the strange voice coming out of him wasn't a mere impersonation, but an embodiment. His second feature, Moneyball (2011) was a solid depiction of underdog coach Billy Bean (Brad Pitt), who changed baseball forever with his use of statistical analysis.<br/><br/>He's done it again with Foxcatcher, the shocking true tale of one man's madness amidst the quest for Olympic gold. Like with Moneyball, we are taken behind the scenes (or beyond the mat) of the sporting world, and the screen is flooded with the same damp, autumn colours as it was in Capote. It is melancholic but unsettling, as if slowly pumping up a balloon and waiting for it to burst. We first meet Olympic gold medallist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), scraping twenty bucks together by appearing in his brother's absence at a school to teach kids the values required to achieve a gold medal. He goes home and eats microwave noodles, and then it's back to the practice mat in preparation for the next tournament.<br/><br/>His luck seems on the rise when he is contacted by the mysterious John du Pont (Steve Carell), the head of a vastly wealthy dynasty who lives at his huge, beautiful Foxcatcher Farm. Curious, Mark goes to meet him and learns of du Pont's plans to make his farm the breeding ground of American wrestling. He instantly signs up, and Mark is given his own cabin and top-notch training facility. He is also given lots of cocaine, and soon submits to du Pont, at one point seen crouching in front of du Pont on his porch, like a well- trained guard dog. But du Pont is not satisfied with Mark alone - he wants his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an gold medallist - at Foxcatcher too. Only Dave has settled with his wife (Sienna Miller) and children in the suburbs and, as Mark points out, can't be bought. Du Pont cannot process this.<br/><br/>If you don't know the bizarre news story that came out of this arrangement, then it's best not to know. The film's foreboding is creeping. The introduction of John du Pont doesn't portray him as the strange, uncharismatic, and increasingly deranged man that he was; instead we see him at a distance, muttering pleasantries and looking down that huge nose of his. He doesn't convince as a wrestling coach, but Mark laps up the attention and luxury like any young man in his position would. When Dave eventually arrives, he sees du Pont for what he is - a man-child who inherited wealth, buying tanks to add to his military paraphernalia and living in fear of his reclusive mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave), wishing himself a leader of men without possessing any of the necessary skills required to be so. Only at this point, Mark has seen it too, but he also resents the success of his brother.<br/><br/>Miller and screenwriters E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman take all of this and makes it an analogy of modern America, where wealth inherited rather than earned still looms large over a country sworn to pursuing the dream and democracy. The performances are terrific. Carell and Ruffalo earned the Oscar nominations, but Tatum more than holds his own. In a scene just after a lost bout, Mark paces his room like a cage animal, suddenly bursting with rage and destroying a mirror with his head. Considering this was improvised on the spot by a dedicated Tatum, it really takes the breath away. Like the recent work of David Fincher, I believe that in the years to come, Foxcatcher will be studied as a window into our times and will be viewed as one of the finest American films of it's era.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Baring that in mind this movie was something that I recommend skipping no matter the alternative. I wish I could tell you about acting but there was none, the few parts that had speech took all of three seconds and the rest of it was a blur of pointless events. If they wanted to make a documentary about a wrestler why didn't they just say so? Making people waste time like this should be against the law. Now on to plot points, there were none. Wrestler is coached by brother, he leaves brother to try on his own, fails, trains with brother again, and then leaves. That's it, that's the whole movie. This is one of those things where someone will try to tell you that a blank canvas is art, don't be fooled it's just blank canvas. 1/10 simply because there was no lower marks."

John Dupont seems to have had some underlying mental problems, drug and alcohol abuse only exacerbated by his disapproving mother who held the purse strings to the family fortune. Dupont spent his entire life trying to get her approval which never came.
There are a number of story lines going on here....
1. The family dynamics of the Duponts and the power play between parent and child
2. The ups and downs of olympic athletes and how they make a living after their moment of glory
3. How anything can be bought given the right circumstances

"classicsoncall","7","1","1","25 July 2019"," ""We caught the fox, didn't we?""
","To claim that John du Pont was a bit weird would be quite the understatement. He was more like bizarre, and consequently, Steve Carell's portrayal of the chemical company heir is not just good, it's scary good. There were just enough hints in the story to suggest how du Pont's upbringing derailed his emotional development, to the point where he wound up detached and almost dysfunctional regarding human relationships. There's also a hint of homosexuality in his make-up, though the story doesn't really quite go there in terms of his conduct with champion wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), even if the feeling is palpable.<br/><br/>What's sad to witness is the downward spiral of Mark Schultz, losing much of his desire and incentive to excel once he's caught up in the materialistic world of du Pont. Quite honestly, the business with cocaine came out of left field for this viewer, considering how fundamentally athletic and conscientious both he and du Pont were with regard to the training regimen at the Valley Forge training facility. It was Mark's good fortune that brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) maintained his love and loyalty for Mark, even after some bitter moments. Even though John du Pont had an inability to effectively communicate with the brothers, he was still there as a wedge between the two regarding their future plans and aspirations.<br/><br/>What kind of surprises me is that I had never heard this story about John du Pont and the Schultz Brothers before seeing this film. I'm fairly up to speed on current events when they occur and even though the time frame here was the late Eighties, it seemed to fly under my radar back in the day. Unlike most sports stories where final victory is celebrated as an achievement by an athlete or team against incredible odds, this one is more likely to leave one feeling dispirited and unnerved with no happy ending. Watch this one for the performances of the principal players who inhabit their characters with a compassion and pathos that goes against the grain of a typical movie experience."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","1","9 March 2018"," Foxcatcher is described as an ""electrifying thriller"", but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
","Based on the true events of John du Pont forming a wrestling team with the Schultz brothers for the 1988 Olympic Games. It's a story of both power and control, as the struggle for constant authority creates tension and paranoia within the team. This eventuality leads to an unforeseen tragic event. Foxcatcher is what I would class as an interesting character study, on both Mark Schultz and John du Pont. The constant desire for victory and the goals for patriotism. Du Pont having unlimited money, can do pretty much whatever he wishes. That in itself is control, but yet seemingly he consistently loses that authoritative presence to Dave Schultz. Was really interesting to watch. Transformative performances for both Channing Tatum and Steve Carell really aided is portraying their characters realistically. Both of them were outstanding and deserved every recognition they got. Their physical prowess was extraordinary. Mark Ruffalo was consistent yet again, however Vanessa Redgrave was criminally underused. The wrestling scenes that they actually contributed in were well filmed and exciting to watch. It's not a sport I'm familiar with, but I've taken down some notes...y'know, in case I need to decimate a thug or something. Bennett Miller's direction was very precise, he took his time with the plot and the long static camera shots evidently showed that. This leads me to the massive negative of the film: pacing. This was slow. Far too slow. 134 minutes of character development that leads to a 1 minute event at the end. Although, that final event was executed to perfection and full of tension. However, I can see why people dislike the pace. Intriguingly, the execution of the dialogue was at a snail's pace as well! Waiting for Carell to say a sentence takes about 2 minutes. Sure it's captivating if you truly focus, but for those who actually don't have any interest in this will surely fall asleep. An ""electrifying thriller"" it is not, but a very well executed character study it is."

It's based on a true story, a story that I as an European had never heard of, and that makes it even more interesting. The make-up artists deserve a lot of credits in Foxcatcher because if it was not for the distinctive voice of Steve Carrell, that I immediately recognized, his physic transformation was stunning. You could hardly recognize him. Channing Tatum's make-up was also good. He looked like he escaped from his cave and he did portray the image that I had of a wrestler very well. The story is easy to follow and the outcome was not what I thought it would be, that was a bonus. The character of John Du Pont played by Steve Carrell is the typical rich guy that thinks everything is for sale and the guy that thinks he can get away with anything. He's a repulsive guy to watch but very well done from Steve Carrell. So even if you're not interested in wrestling give this movie a chance, you might like it like I did."

","From the moment Steve Carell made his first on screen appearance, you could already sense something off about his character, but because you can't imagine what it could be and whether your feelings are accurate or not, it's very easy to dismiss; however, still, you remain uneasy, and that, is just brilliant.<br/><br/>Though I truly haven't the slightest idea as to who Dave Schultz is, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal and performance was just majestic. The mannerisms and idiosyncrasies were testament to Ruffalo's ability to harness his craft with ease and precision.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum however, is not nearly as good as his costars, and though I don't really have a problem with him in this particular film, Channing is an awful to mediocre and forgettable actor at best, and even at his best - which I believe was the case in Foxcatcher - he isn't enough... He isn't capable. What helped him tremendously in this film, were the ranges and quality of his fellow stars.<br/><br/>I believe Foxcatcher would've definitely benefited from the exclusion of Tatum. Ryan Gosling, James Franco, Chris Pratt, Jake Gyllenhaal... Maybe even Liam Hemsworth, any of these guys, would've assisted in bringing Foxcatcher home, and complimented everything else that was just so right with this film.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a story I didn't see coming. It has a slow start, that becomes confusing, but in a good way, because it depicts senselessness in a way that creates more questions for the viewer as to why; and the answer, is surly and truly worth the wait.<br/><br/>I'd love to give Foxcatcher a solid 8/10, but it had an element that, even with his greatest attempt, always only seems to sap away rather than contribute to, and sadly, though he was seemingly much better this time around, Channing Tatum still couldn't shy away from his natural setting; and because of that, Tatum is to Carell and Ruffalo, what du Pont was to Dave and Mark. 7.4/10."

Accepting the offer, Mark at first finds Pont to be a father figure he has always wanted, but overtime,they both find their relationship to get trapped in a foxhole. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Keeping any punchlines in the foxhole, Steve Carell gives a reptile- like performance as du Pont, whose stoic manner and fading vocal delivery cast a shadow of a man worn down to the bone. Smashing his head into a mirror as an improve, Channing Tatum gives a very good performance as Mark,whose passion for the sport Tatum turns from energetic to tired, whilst Mark Ruffalo gives the bio-pic some real folk charm as David.<br/><br/>For the third in his ""Based on true life"" trilogy, director Bennett Miller & cinematographer Greig Fraser wrestle with a raw, unsettling calm atmosphere,as lingering shots on the conversations between Pont and Mark grab the sour turn the almost father/son relationship takes.

","In this Bennette Miller Drama 'Foxcatcher' you get to see the darker side of sport, the sport in this case being wrestling. Unlike Mickey Rourke's 'The Wrestler' which indeed was very heartbreaking and rough, this film concentrates more on the background events, which include Tatum and his brother (Ruffalo) and the tensity between them and Tatums wrestling trainer (Steve Carrel) I have to say, after seeing this movie it left me feeling a bit down and depressed, but that was the intention of the movie. It done perfectly on making you feel very sorry for Carrel's character, and gives you a big shock towards the end. It is one of the movies you can't easily forget, and is one of the greatest films i've seen in a long time. I thought the performances, from all Tatum, Carrell, and particularly Ruffalo were fantastic,. The impact it gave me through all the characters worked perfectly. I truly felt sorry for all these characters in the movie, especially Carrel. To think that this was a true story is terrifying, when you've seen the movie you'll understand,. But if you haven't seen it, i highly recommend you try and see this somehow, because it is definitely worth a watch. A lot better than i was expecting.

","The story of Mark Shultz and his relationship with John E. Du Pont is dark, layered and complex. As I said the film is very deeply focused on the relationship between these two men and how they developed this relationship which begins with Mark (Tatum) trying to escape his brother Dave's (Ruffalo) shadow. John (Carell) on the other hand wishes to prove himself as independent and capable in the eyes of his mother and sees wrestling as the way to do it. The two find solace in each other and attempt to grow and develop into stronger men and good friends. The story takes a turn for the worse when Du Pont's mother shows disapproval in John's wrestling team and skills. Upon hearing this, seeking a chance for approval from his mother John betrays Marks friendship and trust bringing Dave in believing he will validate team Foxcatcher in the eyes of his mother all the while taking away Mark's opportunity to escape from his brother's shadow. Upon Dave's arrival Mark grows closer to his brother once more having felt betrayed by John. This Perplexes John who does not understand how he could return to someone he resented so much and tries desperately to acquire his friendship again. This is very much a story of loyalty and betrayal and puts these themes at the heart of its story and delivers it perfectly depicting their relationship in a realistic and deep way. Bennet Miller's direction is felt in every shot and face twitch of this movie creating a dark eerie setting for what is ultimately a tragic tale. This pacing may be very slow for some but it is deliberate and it's in place to develop and destroy this relationship in a provoking way. I would not recommend the film for all popcorn chewing audiences but for those who seek a dark and brutal character driven tale this is an excellent film to watch."
"danielhirst","10","1","1","6 August 2015"," A movie about power
","Some reviewers have claimed that Foxcatcher is at essence a movie about repressed homosexual tension. To me, this is an instance of the projection of an individual's own concerns and ideological framework onto a movie.<br/><br/>In response, you may ask why any interpretation that I develop is in anyway different: surely I have my own dogmas and conceptual constructs that get in the way of an ""objective viewing"". Such an objection would have some truth to it, but I would not be willing to concede the post-modern notion that there is no objective truth to any piece of art.<br/><br/>If interpretation was merely projection, then I cannot see how any kind of discussion could take place about a piece of art: regardless of the question of whether it is good or bad, there must be some objectivity to what it is.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a movie about power. The movie nearly explodes with tension: a tension between individuals dominating each other in a multitude of ways. It is also about narcissism: the attempt of someone to create a reality about themselves that is wildly disconnected from who they are.<br/><br/>The movie presents events that occurred in the real lives of Mark (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Both brothers won Olympic gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 games held in Los Angeles. The movie opens with them practicing together. When Dave gets the better of his younger brother, Mark reacts with a cheap blow to the face, making Dave bleed. This action symbolises the relationship that follows: an emotionally vulnerable younger brother, who lashes out at his older brother in the knowledge that his older brother will not hurt him back; an older brother who knows the vulnerabilities of his younger brother, but does not react due to a understanding of his own role as the holder of power in the relationship and his self-definition as benevolent leader.<br/><br/>The power dynamics intensify with the introduction of John du Pont, played by Steve Carell. Carell plays du Pont as a slightly disfigured man on the threshold of insanity. Carell could be criticized for overacting the role; however, the performance works when contrasted against the considered Ruffalo and the quietly brooding Tatum.<br/><br/>Du Pont is the heir to one of the wealthiest families in the United States and lives in an enormous compound with his mother. His mother disapproves of him, and du Pont is desperate for her approval. We are made to feel that du Pont is a man without any achievements of his own and has bought his way to artificial success. His mother has a large stable of expensive horses, for which she has won various awards. Du Pont attempts to out-do his mother with his own stable of successful wrestlers, and in doing so gain her respect.<br/><br/>With the promise of money, stability and a paternal role model, Mark takes up an offer to live in du Pont's commune as part of Team Foxcatcher. At one stage, Dave asks Mark what du Pont gets out of the relationship, to which Mark states that du Pont simply wants to help people and advance America. As the movie progresses we realise that du Pont wants to be the team's guru: their respected life coach who they look to for wisdom and support. Essentially he wants to help himself, by manufacturing a reality to confirm his narcissistic veneer.<br/><br/>The movie escalates when Dave joins Mark as the coach of Team Foxcatcher. Dave realises upon arrival that Mark has entered an unhealthy relationship with du Pont: his once idealistic brother has been victim of du Pont's narcissistic rages, and is once more playing the role of the tormented child. However, this time Mark's master's intentions do not contain an concern and true affection.<br/><br/>Dave is the true threat to du Pont: he enjoys the true respect of the wrestlers, and has a sense of genuine authority. His authority has been won by achievement and wisdom rather than money. Dave also sees through du Pont's mask more clearly than the others, which is something du Pont both senses and resents.<br/><br/>The final stages of the movie see du Pont's mask gradually slipping, and Mark moving back under the comforting shade of his older brother. Upon being revealed as psychologically disfigured to the people that he was desperate to lead, du Pont explodes under the tension, and by killing Dave murders the shame he felt towards his own weakness and ineptitude. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a magnificent account of power: power between siblings; true versus bought power; and ultimately the power that misplaced shame can have on the life on an individual and those around him.<br/><br/>This review is taken from: amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com"

","John du Pont has more money than he knows what to do with. He is a miserable man who has spent his life trying to be something he can never be. He is pathetic as an athlete, so he brings in a man who suffers from an inferiority complex despite his earning a gold medal in the Olympics. Mark Schultz should have the world by the butt but he is caught in an aimless quest to earn enough to survive. His brother Dave, who has also been an Olympic champion, has gone on with his life. His love and affection for his brother keep the poor guy going, but it also overshadows him. DuPont decides to create a wrestling club and enlist the help of Mark Schultz and pretty soon the poor schmuck becomes his right hand man. Steve Carell is brilliant as the schizophrenic du Pont who imagines himself the savior of the country. He believe he is a real wrestling coach, even though he knows very little (he is able to look good because he gives huge sums of money to his stable of athletes). Carell's sickness pervades the entire picture as the men he commands begin to see his irrationality for what it is. There is also the classic Freudian stuff. This movie makes one uncomfortable from the get-go and yet we can't take our eyes off the sick man."

Especially is about human behavior about the thin line between good and bad, logic and craziness, pain and happiness. This is a true story and all true stories are powerful in way. I end up loving this film and think about it for days. This means for me that it is a good film, with an excellent cast and a great leading performance."

","Foxcatcher (2014): Dir: Bennett Miller / Cast: Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, Vanessa Redgrave, Sienna Miller: Compelling and tense true story drama about reputation, fame, goals, and ultimately, sanity. Channing Tatum plays Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz who feels overshadowed by the broader achievements of his older brother David, played by Mark Ruffalo. Set in the late 1980's, story centres around Mark being summoned to the wealthy estate of wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont. Steve Carell takes an impressive facial transformation as du Pont who suffers social alienation from his stern mother who views wrestling as a ""low sport."" He attempts to connect with Mark in order to form a wrestling team for the Olympics but convincing David to uproot his family to train there provides a challenge that further isolates him. This traces back to a childhood of never maintaining or finding the ability to mirror the du Pont legacy for success. Tatum beefs up as Mark, who accepts du Pont's cocaine offer but becomes distant and withdrawn when David arrives. Ruffalo as the skilled David is dedicated but also to his two children and wife. Vanessa Redgrave is seen briefly as the icy du Pont mother who owns several horses for sport. The film's one weakness is the lack of detail to other wrestlers at the estate or even Sienna Miller who seems wasted as David's wife who witnesses the concluding tragedy. After directing Capote and Moneyball Bennett Miller delivers the trauma of emotional isolation that eventually catches up to the fox in question. Score: 9 ½ / 10"
"eddie_baggins","8","1","1","14 June 2015"," An immensely creepy and wonderfully acted slow-burn
","One of the most impressively eerie films of recent times, Foxcatcher is another quality film to be directed by Bennett Miller that may well just be the film that officially leads him to be called the master of the mood piece after the quality Philip Seymour Hoffman starring Capote and the most interesting movie ever filmed about stats Moneyball came before this new slice of true story filmmaking.<br/><br/>The less known about Foxcatcher the better and its clear Bennett wanted his 2 hour plus feature to be an exercise in the slow build and under the skin creepiness that so many films strive for yet fail to reach. Bennett nails the films 80's set production design and glum mood and upcoming horror filmmakers could strangely take tips from the way Bennett constructs many of his scenes, never has a late night wrestle or an awkward documentarian conversation been so utterly off putting. Foxcatcher's tone is flawless and tone perfectly suited yet it's well designed coldness is also its biggest weakness as we sadly never feel overly affiliated with the movies main troupe of actors, despite the work of Steve Carell, Channing Tatum (making up for Magic Mike) and Mark Ruffalo who together produce a stunning 3 pronged acting attack.<br/><br/>Delivering career best turns, Carell and Tatum deserve all the plaudits they received for there on song turns. Carell is quietly menacing and near unrecognisable as real life figure John du Pont, a billionaire, wrestling loving mummy's boy that has more deep seeded issues than you'd care to imagine and his chemistry with Tatum's slow yet dedicated Olympian wrestler Mark Shultz produces many of the films strongest scenes. John and Mark's friendship and comradery take this tale to many dark yet fascinating places and when accompanied by Ruffalo's assured turn as Mark's older brother David, Foxcatcher truly soars to some great dramatic heights and the oft unappealing sport of wrestling becomes a thoroughly thrilling back drop to all manner of human conditions, laid out bare on the mats these men compete on.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher will not be for everyone and it's by no means a flawless film, yet it's a refreshingly unique and uncompromising poetically licensed telling of a seriously troubling true life tale. With 3 standout acting turns, particularly from the here starkly unfunny Steve Carell and the oft misused Channing Tatum, Foxcatcher is another quality film by Miller that would attest to him being one of the finest dramatic directors working today.<br/><br/>4 late night wrestles out of 5"

Two-Channing Tatum should have been at least nominated for a Oscar. Three-make-up should have won a Oscar.

He showed the logic and sense of a mad man maniac who had neither logic or sense. Ruffalo gave a heartwarming performance as the family man. He raised the bar to meet the stupendous standards met by other actors. He compelled me to crave his victory. All I wanted was for Dave Shultz's life to be perfect but it is never a perfect world. <br/><br/>The only problem I found with this film (one I am disappointed in my self for having it) is that the film did take a thew liberties with making sure the film flew by. Every film has at least one inconsistency. This films was pace. The pace was uneven. Some parts dragged beyond belief. I was consistently checking to see what the time was.

"vismao9","10","1","1","20 May 2015"," Americana notion of Regicide
","True story. True experience. It is very hard to achieve this level of authenticity that still feels larger than life. Bennett Miller, director known for his perfectionism and slow deliverance, doesn't try to mask his motives. He is very clear about the story goals.The patricide. Killing a ""father"". Breaking off. It is the film of Fathers and Sons, for them and about them.<br/><br/>""People who don't have fathers tend to have two strong qualities. One, they tend to feel that anything is possible and the other is an unrelenting anxiety and insecurity"", Miller pointed out in one of the post-release movie interviews. The film raises big questions that speak to all of us. We are all somebody's children and we all have to make our own lives despite of them. How hard it is to reconcile integrity with the need to earn a living? How hard (or necessary) is to break off from your family in order to find your true identity? Can you really escape the clutches of your heritage? What hides behind the incredulous world of the rich benefactors, the fathers of ""the greatest nation in the world"" and their protégés?<br/><br/>Deep-dive, subtext, allegorical aspects are there. The facts are there; wealth, class, entitlement. It is all there. But this film is more intelligent and subtle than its elements. It is not trying to point at what is obvious or solve the crime. It doesn't tell you what to think. Instead, it is looking at the roots of these people and it allows you to determine who these people really are without laying it to your lap. And it does so in a very quiet, painful way  From the very first scene in the film, introducing Dave and Mark, Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team, the wordless expression of their relationship, naturally intimate physicality of wrestling communicates the love between the brothers. Straight to the bone, austere, tough love. Dave Shultz, the older brother and a father figure, is played by Mark Ruffalo. His character brings warmth and humanity in the mostly inhumane lives of professional wrestlers. It is a hard task and Ruffalo's performance is restrained yet deep, depicting to the last atom the complexity of a unique brotherly love. He is, also, the black mirror for Dupont, the ""patron"" and a self-imposed father figure. By being himself, dedicated and caring coach and brother whom everyone looks up to, Dave is unwillingly sending the hurtful message to Dupont: this is what you will never be. Not with all your money and all your power. You cannot buy love, respect nor talent. Rough fact- easy to say, much harder to learn. <br/><br/>Channing Tatum plays Mark Shultz, introverted emotionally troubled wrestling prodigy.Portrayed as a big gorilla that speaks physical language fluently, yet verbally and emotionally is on a level of a 5-year old. Great performance,though exaggerated to the verge of a parody Wrestling is not supposed to feel ""real"" or ""natural"", I mean these men are treated as highly- trained cage animals and their struggles are incomprehensible to the most of the humans. They are not really expected to have weaknesses or breakdowns as the rest of us. Still, Tatum painted this character with many shades and sensibility of a broken child in need of a strong paternal presence. We never doubt his weak spot or his fragility. This is where Dupont finds him...or they find each other. In spite of his wealth and power status, Dupont suffers from the same deprivation, or depravity in his case. They are both driven by the same raw ambition to reach greatness at any cost. Vanesa Redgrave is brilliant in a role of Dupont's controlling aloof mother, an old-money heiress who drives the last nail in her son's fragile ego.<br/><br/>For some, the most surprising element in the film was the comedy star Steve Carell. Wtf, Steve Carrell starring in heavy drama?! Yes, all comedians have dark side, and yes, they can be really, really scary. After watching it, I can't imagine anyone but Carell in this role. His comedic sensibility, a serious committed talent and incredibly specific work found a place for Dupont's bizarre persona, and the right attitude. Even that big artificial nose and over-the-top prosthetic serve the performance legibly- an excuse to look down upon others, to distance himself even more from the ""regular"" people.<br/><br/>If you couldn't care less about the wrestling that makes majority scenes in the film (like I don't), or if you can't sympathize with the characters that hard and impenetrable, you will feel what they are feeling, and you will empathize with their struggle. Wrestling functions as a perfect metaphor. It is the most primal of sports, the one in which you bend another person to your will. Literally. The story of power and manipulation never gets old. Dave's complex relationship with his ""surrogate father"" Dupont communicates much more than misplaced egos of its protagonists. It portrays generations and generations of Duponts and Schultz'. I would dare to say even -one whole nation. No wonder it took years to edit and sleep on it in order for Miller to find the film's true voiceIt is a very quiet subtle voice that gets under your skin slowly and gradually it becomes impossible to ignore. A lot of surplus was cut off so the voice of the film becomes this meticulous and precise- a time well used.<br/><br/>The final result?<br/><br/>Haunting, insightful and intelligent film that will probably stay with you long after you finish watching it It is felt more that watched. Heavy stuff."

","FOXCATCHER is a psychological drama directed by Academy Award nominee Bennett Miller (MONEYBALL) and starring Golden Globe winner Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo, Academy Award winner Vanessa Redgrave and Sienna Miller. The film was written by E. Max Frye and Academy Award nominee Dan Futterman. FOXCATCHER tells the story of Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Tatum), who sees a way out from the shadow of his more celebrated wrestling brother Dave (Ruffalo) and a life of poverty when he is summoned by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont (Carell) to move onto his estate and train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Desperate to gain the respect of his disapproving mother, du Pont begins ""coaching"" a world-class athletic team and, in the process, lures Mark into dangerous habits, breaks his confidence and drives him into a self-destructive spiral. Based on actual events, FOXCATCHER is a gripping and profoundly American story of fragile men who pinned their hopes for love and redemption on a desperate obsession for greatness that was to end in tragedy."
"lucasversantvoort","9","1","1","6 May 2015"," Wonderfully tense and subtle drama
","Bennett Miller is really becoming a director who seems to very carefully choose his projects. After about ten years, Foxcatcher is only his third film after Capote and Moneyball, but with that kind of track record it's hard to complain.<br/><br/>Like many films before it, Foxcatcher is ""based on a true story,"" the advantage for me being I had never heard of this tragedy. All I knew was it was about wrestling and some millionaire. Needless to say, knowing next to nothing about Foxcatcher is a one-way ticket to dramatic impact.<br/><br/>The film opens with a dissonant cello solo which segues into a piano solo accompanied by archival footage from what I assume is the Du Pont family. It all seems innocent enough, but the music lends the footage a melancholy and sinister feel. We suddenly cut to Mark Schultz who's training. We're also quickly introduced to his brother Dave, who Mark considers to be better than him. Even in their first scene we get a grasp of the tension between them, at least from Mark's perspective. He wants to surpass Dave and feels frustrated, but can't express these feelings as Dave's the very image of kindness and support. Out of nowhere, Mark receives a call by an associate of the Du Pont family, asking if he's willing to travel to their estate and be trained by John E. du Pont. Mark agrees and has a face to face with John who inspires him with talk of America. Mark agrees to be trained for the Olympics in Seoul '88. For Mark, this is obviously the chance to step out of his brother's shadow. John asks if Dave can also be persuaded, but Dave refuses, citing parental responsibilities. And so begins the strange relationship between Mark and John, a relationship that would end bloody to the shock of everyone involved.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Foxcatcher was denied a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, but did receive nominations for directing, screenplay and so on. Obviously, despite being released way back in August, something stuck with voters, and I do think it's the direction. Miller's direction lends every scene a very palpable sense of dread and inevitability, this despite the relative lack of action. So much is told visually. Miller knows how to let the image do the talking, which fits the story as Mark and John are people who's lines belies their true feelings and anxieties. Especially strong is the suggestion of how John's family history keeps haunting him. Those people from the opening footage may be long gone, but their overbearing values live on, much to John's frustration.<br/><br/>The script too is genius, although you wouldn't notice it at first glance. These days, it's the creative writing à la Sorkin that is praised. Foxcatcher reverses this trend: its use of language is simplified on purpose to suggest, among other things, that John and Mark actually have nothing in common and that John is completely incapable of providing emotional support. Their first talk is almost comical. On the surface, it seems like Mark and John have 'found each other,' but the explicitly simple language actually hints at precisely the opposite.<br/><br/>Needless to say, everything's perfect in terms of acting. The casting is pitch perfect. Channing Tatum is provided with a role that plays to his strength, suggesting an anger that threatens to erupt at any moment. Ruffalo is seemingly becoming the next Ed Harris, the ultimate supporting actor. He's very persuasive as what is basically the ultimate nice guy. He's particularly impressive during the scene where, for a documentary, he's asked to look into the camera and say some very specific, positive things about John. But the true surprise is obviously funnyman Steve Carell who plays John very calmly, but is all the while hinting at the tragedy and malice underlying his actions, his desperate attempts to gain his mother's approval and so on.<br/><br/>But, in the end, it's Miller's tense and tender direction that will stay with you. He emphasizes the beautiful landscape, the rolling hills and so on, but he also constantly suggests impending tragedy while never resorting to typically thriller-esque camera angles (killer cams) and so on. He uses very little to say so much. Simply through cinematography we start to understand John more and more through, his relationship with his mother, the way he looks at the countless trophies that adorn the walls of the estate, his desperate attempts to succeed in the eyes of others. Foxcatcher feels like the perfect drama, where every scene serves a purpose and it all seems to perfectly lead towards an inevitable ending. Not only that, but Miller's direction puts a lot of faith in the audience which is always a plus. Never does the film resort to neatly tying up any psychological loose ends à la Psycho. It's easily one of the best films of 2014."

The description of it doesn't do it justice. As a woman a film about 'wrestling' wasn't that appealing initially, but this film is about so much more. The story is fascinating and unfolds at a gentle pace. The acting is incredible both by Channing Tatum and Steve Carell. After watching the movie I researched the facts behind the film and was stunned that this really was in parts a true story - perhaps it's a UK thing, but it isn't something we heard about over here at the time.

Steve Carrell s superb as the odd, over-bearing and unlikeable Du Pont, who obviously has some sort of mother inferiority complex. I'm not generally a fan of his, but Channing Tatum was very good in this..in fact I felt his character's relationship with Du Pont was very similar to Matt Damon's character with Liberace in Behind the Candelabra, except with only a hint of a homosexual liaison which the real Schultz strongly denied ever happened. It's only barely hinted at, though Du Pont does come across as a repressed in the closet kind of guy. Mark Ruffalo is excellent as usual, playing the down to earth family man who unfortunately for him and his family accepts Du Ponts offer to join the Foxcatcher team. It's built up beautifully, and the moment when it does come at the end it very shocking. Recommended, and I recommend you check up the real story afterwards as it differs somewhat. 8.5/10"

","I can't believe I left it so late to see this one. I'm also amazed that the story - based on actual events - isn't more widely known. Steve Carell puts in a fine acting performance - it's hard at first to take him seriously in a dramatic role, but he does manage to pull it off very convincingly! Both Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum also put in great performances as brothers with deep rooted sibling rivalry that rolls into adulthood. All the major players in this movie were mesmerizing and the story line will resonate with many people who have grown up with sibling rivalry. You really feel the pain of Channing's character (Mark Schultz). The movie is somewhat disturbing on some levels, but it is really worth watching. You don't have to be an athlete or a fan of wrestling to enjoy the depth of this movie. If you enjoyed Whiplash, then you will enjoy this - it stirs up similar emotions. I thoroughly recommend this one."
"j-penkair","7","1","1","23 March 2015"," Silence of The Wrestlers
","The film is so quiet, much like ""Capote"" of the same directing hand, Bennett Miller. Miller seems to like a thin story, sometimes close to none, and digs deep into a few characters he chooses to reflect the society at large. It takes great skills to give the viewers so little, to be quite reluctant in giving any leads, and to grab them by the heart as this film shows. A lot of films depict drug assumption as a part of their stories, but you feel as if you took the cocaine yourself while John and Mark did so. You feel so much for the characters, so the final shooting scene makes you feel like a true story that happens in your own neighborhood. There are larger points in this film, for example homosexual repression, mother-son relationship, classes in America, etc., but they seem effectively belittled by our feelings for the characters. We do care about them so that we do not care about what they are, have become, or may be anymore. Not many films of today's chaotic world can give us such depth. Bennett Miller should be careful about choosing his next projects, as his depth of filmmaking power should not be wasted. I will suggest a non-American theme like the mystery around Thailand's King Ananda assassination in his own chamber or a portrayal of China's brutal Cultural Revolution. He will make a nice placement for those histories."
"Geeky Randy","8","1","1","17 March 2015"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Based loosely on the story of multimillionaire heir John Eleuthère du Pont (Carell) financing 1984 U.S. Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Tatum) for participation in wrestling competitions. Excellent performances all around—Carell definitely transforms, while Ruffalo is also memorable for the very charismatic Dave Schultz (Mark's older brother). The plot slowly heats up to a boiling ending, with its characters spiraling downhill—more of a quiet and intense film of crime and tragedy rather than wrestling. Not fully accurate, but Miller certainly tries to build multiple layers in order to compensate for cut corners. The script took several years to get off the ground, and the film spent almost an entire year in post production the effort shows.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

In the movie John-Steve Carell- portrays a billionaire-a crazy one-that starts a team for wrestling. Inviting younger brother, Mark Schultz-Channing Tatum- of the olympic wrestler Dave Schultz-Mark Ruffalo. Both are olympic wrestlers, and great ones at that. Even in the movie they train as if it's real. The coordination that they use, makes me feel that they are brothers in real life. Though the ""movie"" isn't even about sports. It's about a billionaire, that takes one olympic brother wrestler, after another. This movie, made me sleep a couple times. The ""movie"" can be anything but a movie.

"avik-basu1889","9","1","1","6 March 2015"," The idiosyncrasies of the human mind !!!
","Bennett Miller has always had the ability to get the best out of his actors. He did it with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Capote, he did it with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in Moneyball, and now he has done it with Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. Mark Ruffalo has done fantastic work before, but I have never seen Carell and Tatum do anything as good as their work in Foxcatcher before. All three actors transform themselves physically and emotionally to give absolutely astonishing performances. <br/><br/>This film is based on a true story. Like the real life story itself, the film is also very dark, haunting and extremely unpredictable. This is a very dark and interesting take on sports films. The film never ever resorts to clichés and remains entirely grounded in reality. The style of storytelling is hypnotic, moody and the pace is intentionally slow. Miller uses minimal editing and allows the actors to express themselves without feeling the need to make jump- cuts. The director gives subtle hints regarding the reasons why some of the things happened, but he never explicitly establishes any solid evidence. This actually gives scope for subjective interpretations. <br/><br/>This film might be difficult for some people to sit through due to the slow pacing. But if you want to watch a film where every actor is at the top of his/her power and if you want to watch a film where the director allows the story to progress effortlessly without feeling the need to resort to clichés, then Foxcatcher is a must watch.<br/><br/>Even though Bennet Miller gives enough hints throughout the film to allow the viewer to make up his/her mind about why the things happened as they did, but above all the film also establishes the idea, that at the end of the day, some things that humans do can defy all logic and explanations."

","I was expecting intensity, an interesting story and character study from this film, but I was disappointed. <br/><br/>The film is intensely bleak, dealing with the sport of wrestling, with no laughs or empathetic moments. Channing Tatum wears the same bull-like expression throughout the whole film, not really evolving much as a character. I just found him whiny, cold and dumb. Mark Ruffalo (whom I really loved in the Avengers) despite being nominated for some prizes, unfortunately didn't stand alone for me in the movie.<br/><br/>Steve Carell's John du Pont, in a surprising dramatic role, comes off as creepy from the moment you meet him. You know fully well that something is off with him (and of course since he murders one of his friends at the end of the film). But sadly, the film doesn't focus too closely on why du Pont murdered Dave, other than the awkward, dysfunctional relationship with his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and the Schultz brothers distancing themselves from him. <br/><br/>For a film that's receiving a lot of awards and praise, this really doesn't cut it for me."
"zetes","9","6","15","17 December 2014"," Exceptional
","Exceptional fact-based drama by workmanlike Bennett Miller, who directed Capote and Moneyball previously. Concerning the murder of a wrestling coach by millionaire heir John du Pont, the film examines what led to the tragedy. The major theme here is wealth and class in America, and it's one of the best films about that that has ever been made. The three major characters, du Pont and two brothers who both won Olympic gold medals, Mark and David Schultz, are beautifully written and plaid by Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively. Carell is a product of pure, American royalty, but having grown up relatively isolated from actual society, he's a giant weirdo. Tatum, the younger brother, lives only for wrestling and doesn't have much besides his older brother outside of that. When du Pont invites him to wrestle under his tutelage, he jumps at the opportunity. Ruffalo is content in his life with his loving family and at first refuses to join the team, though du Pont is very insistent. Of course, he can buy anything, and eventually does, spending an undisclosed amount of money to bring Ruffalo in. The action upsets Tatum, and the whole situation starts to go to Hell. The film is very cold, and quite slow moving, but I was deeply interested throughout. One of the films of the year, no doubt."

There is no main character that achieves glory after training hard and being regarded as an underdog for the whole movie.

(see how they walk in the movie!-OK, the wrestlers might be walking like that and great that they all acted it right but it's a bit silly); Except from that, movie goes on forever, totally slow, uninteresting and complete waste of time. WHile being quite a fan of sport stories, especially when true, this is by far the worst sport related movie I have ever watched. Even though it's about the characters, it still is about the sport as well? I am sorry but the way it's directed is totally not deep, not understandable and you feel like tons of things are missing (I believe I read that in the beginning there was over 40 hrs of material- I Wonder why!!?!). I respect that there are people that see more in this film than I but from an ordinary viewers perspective, I just don't see what's so great about it?? Definitely nothing Worth my attention. And for Oscars - no way! I respect Steve Carell, but the way this was played by him - at least 20 more actors could have done it at least the same... all in all - a disaster movie from my point of view. 2 stars instead of 1 - only cause I have some respect towards those who think it's a masterpiece. Watch it and decide for yourself."

","I had only just finished the book ""Foxcather"" before seeing the film, and really, the movie simply flows along as neatly and precisely as the book does, that is to say, slowly. The central story really doesn't kick in until nearly half way through the book where we deal with Mark Schultz' early life and career and his jealousy of his brother's success. This has all turned around by the time you get to John Du Pont, just not in the rewarding sense that Mark justifiably deserves. He is drawn to Du Pont out of a sense of respect for himself and the need to move on. Steve Carell does a great job of mimicking Du Pont, but there is not a lot of meat there to tuck into. Du Pont's back story is rather well written in the book, but I feel that the movie simply centered on his ""NEED"" to feel loved by his rather clichéd mother figure. There is a lot more to it than that, such as his own attempts at becoming a star in various sports, by contracting the best coaches in whatever sport he tried. In the end, the film really doesn't get to the nitty gritty of why he did what he did, it only hints at matriarchal concerns and a need to be liked, which isn't the whole story. There is a lot of subtlety in this film however, and the director should be praised for sticking rigidly to his source material, and not presenting the two brother wrestlers as All-American Heroes. Mark isn't a particularly likable character, but after reading the book, it's a fairly accurate portrayal by Channing Tatum. Mark Ruffalos character is less to the fore, but portrays his brotherly love and slight superiority well. The problem is, this doesn't necessarily make it the most interesting of movies, and doesn't spell it out for the blockbuster jaded film-goer. 2001 was a great ""slow-movie"", Foxcather just drags along, almost metaphorically mirroring the life of the Mark Schuitz."

","This is a fascinating movie. I don't want to give spoilers so I won't talk about the plot. The actors did incredible work, particularly Steve Carell as a billionaire Du Pont and Channing Tatum as his wrestling star. Mark Ruffallo was also great as Dave Schultz. Carrell's performance is outstanding, he should really win an Oscar. He literally became this eccentric rich man, not just physically but also psychologically. Kudos to Carrell. I knew he had this in him, in spite of his many comedic performances. Tatum is also a nice surprise, he too became Mark Schultz and I might add he was very convincing. It is based on a true story, but there are some inaccuracies due to artistic freedom, which doesn't ruin the story. Do watch this one."
"Quinoa1984","9","6","16","7 December 2014"," an eerie drama about weird obsession and the ""American dream""
","For a lot of people, but especially athletes, we're told that going for a respective native country is a very admirable, noble, Go-For-It aim. And for Americans, it's the ultimate sort of hope, at least in conventional terms - being the ""Best"" and representing the country in places like, say, the Olympics. This is what John Du Pont (a mostly unrecognizable Steve Carrell) tells to the young, impressionable Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum, recognizable as can be), that his ambitions should be directed to get the gold - again - for America, as it is. Schultz is impressed by Du Pont, if nothing else by the attention of someone who is, as Mark sees, a super wealthy man (one of the biggest wealth-areas in the country), and wants to join him in his quest for Olympic glory in 1988 along with his brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) who is not quite as enthusiastic, mostly due to his family/current work commitments. No matter, Mark will do it for John, this will work... for a little while...<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a helluva piece of work, mostly in how director Bennett Miller stages his scenes and lets them unfold with his cast. This isn't a film with urgent line-a-minute drama. On the contrary this moves more like a slow-burn dramatic film from the 70's (think, I don't know, Fat City or something in terms of tone), and he spends a lot of time just watching his actors move around settings, looking at objects and pictures in the Du Pont home, the horses in the barns and fields, the wrestlers moving their bodies this way and that (like apes at times, even the brothers, which makes Du Pont's comment at one cruel moment - ""You ungrateful ape"" - to a character all the more brutal and spot-on). There's a lot of watching and waiting, and all the time, surrounded by stuffed birds, desperate, lonely men, and eerie, weird vibes, it makes for a film that us uncompromising.<br/><br/>All three lead actors pull in solid work here. Tatum has been getting amazing notices from critics across the board, and this is his best work as a dramatic actor (personally I still prefer his comedic work or Magic Mike, but that's neither here nor there), in large part because he is there to react and listen. He doesn't have to emote in LOUD ways, if that makes sense. His most intense scene is in a hotel room and is mostly in shadows, so it's really about the internal space this character inhabits. And it's a compelling, interesting one: here is a man who is an Olympic champion, yet without this opportunity from Du Pont he would be still eating Ramen noodles and few prospects. Tatum goes for this uncertainty, then certainty, then going-off-the-rails, and then doom and gloom, with a quiet quality that comes through extremely well.<br/><br/>Ruffalo has an easier role to play - the more ""normal"" character here, who has his most pressing conflicts when dealing with his younger brother, or having to basically lie to a camera crew doing a propaganda documentary on Du Pont as a wrestling coach - but still is fascinating to watch for how much emotion he puts into a 'straight' man in awkward or tense moments like those wrestling matches or the prep. He may be underrated come awards time when Tatum and Carrell get the bulk of the limelight, but he is no slouch here in the slightest.<br/><br/>And Carrell. Jesus. In a way there can be a big criticism of his performance, or maybe it's just down to how the writers present him (one of them from Miller's Capote, the other from Something Wild), that he's one-dimensional, or not that 'deep' exactly in his enclosed, rich weirdo. He really doesn't 'change' so much during the film. Things happen around him and he is not the most predictable Character (with a capital C) as he may be benevolent one moment, and slap your face the next or get mad you didn't put the 50-caliber machine gun on the tank (yep, that happens, that's how wealthy the Du Ponts were), but he is pretty much the same sort of ""off"" kind of crazy from start to finish. It's just that by the end, his crazy finally comes un-spooled, whereas before it's more about the package of this man. (What's the line in the movie Speed? 'Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric.') <br/><br/>But all the same, Carrell inhabits this guy, and makes his loneliness and (maybe) latent homosexuality or whatever it is about him that gets him engaged about wrestling to a fullness. I felt repulsed, intrigued, confused, scared by this guy, who lurks around his mansion and comes to these wrestling practices - and at one point wrestles himself, albeit in a fixed match which he may or may not know about - like a vampire. Indeed how Schultz comes to this man's premises, becomes ingratiated, it's only a wonder the man doesn't get more people under his wing. Actually he does, under the guise of still having a lot of wealth and being able to do whatever he wants. If we ask an actor in such a quietly towering role to just be truthful to being a freak, Carrell is Freak of the Year.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher at times may be a little long, or a little ambling in its pacing, but it all builds up. By the time it comes to that climax, it's shocking not so much for what it is but how inevitable and, maybe, preventable it could have been. The stakes in this movie are about mental wellness, attraction, and being enveloped in guises and dreams for something 'more'. It's presented like an All-American nightmare; one wonders if this is on a double-bill with the recent Nightcrawler if some would want to just give up on the promises for a better society."

","One of the worse legitimate non b movies I have ever seen! I have written very few reviews but I cannot believe how badly written this movie is in many respects. It is billed as crime drama movie. It is really a (remotely related, very slow, and boring) drama crime movie. There is two hours of character development of 3 characters with no indication a crime is going to be committed, then there are a few minutes of the the crime involving two of the characters where one was murdered, then a few minutes of the assailing character's capture, then a scene of what the third remaining character did with his life afterwords, and finally a very brief written description of what happened to everyone afterwords and, of course, the credits. That is not a crime drama. A crime drama has the crime occur early in the movie and the drama involves its continuation and/or its resulting police investigation, apprehension, arrest, and conviction (or some variation of) afterward. Non of that drama part occurred here in the very least! Its like while filming the movie, someone discovered they were filming a crime drama so they tacked on the crime in at the very end. So voilà, a crime drama.<br/><br/>The movie has many deficiencies that have been pointed out by others so I will list some of them.<br/><br/>The chronology is not well documented of movies actions outside of events labeled by a year like the 1988 Olympics. Specifically, the murder appears to have occurred shortly after the 1988 Olympics where in reality it occurred 8 years afterwords. The internet has indicated many things happened in that time which is not covered by the movie but at the rate movie progresses, that would be another 4 hours! A 6 hour movie?!<br/><br/>The scenes are too slow and long.<br/><br/>The mental condition of John Dupont is glossed over leaving many questions.<br/><br/>The academics accomplishments of the characters earlier in their lives are not presented apparently allowing the writers to make the characters look dumber than they really were.<br/><br/>Save two hours of your life and read about these people in the internet. You actually learn more about these people from the other negative reviews in IMDb than from the movie.<br/><br/>If you had to write about movie in a class paper and instead took information from the internet because you could not get a copy of the movie, you would get an automatic E because your paper would be too accurate and complete."

"Hellmant","9","4","10","21 January 2015"," A really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film!
","'FOXCATCHER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed biographical thriller about two Olympic champion brothers, who are asked by an eccentric multimillionaire to be a part of his future wrestling team. It stars Steve Carell as the multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont, and Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo as the wrestling brothers, Mark and David Schultz. It was directed by Bennett Miller; who also directed another critically acclaimed 'true crime' thriller (in 2005) called 'CAPOTE', as well as another critically acclaimed sports film (in 2011) called 'MONEYBALL'. It was written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman (Futterman also wrote 'CAPOTE') and it's based on the tragic true events; which surrounded the lives of the Schultz brothers and John E. du Pont. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and it was nominated for five Academy Awards; including Best Director, Best Actor (Carell), Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo) and Best Original Screenplay. It's a really dark, disturbing and extremely ambiguous film; I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br/><br/>Mark and David Schultz (Tatum and Ruffalo) both won gold medals for wrestling, in the 1984 Olympics. Four years later Dave lived happily with his wife (Sienna Miller) and kids, but Mark was relatively depressed and poor (despite his gold medal and past fame). So when Mark is suddenly contacted by a multimillionaire, named John E. du Pont (Carell), and asked to come stay at his estate in order to help train a wrestling team for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Mark happily takes him up on his offer (as he's paid very well in return). Du Pont asks Mark to invite his brother along as well, but Dave doesn't want to leave his family. A strange bond forms between Mark and du Pont as Mark is eager to win another gold medal and du Pont sees an opportunity to become a respected wrestling coach, as well as finally win the approval of his overbearing mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Things don't go as planned and tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>The real Mark Schultz served as a consultant for much of the film's production but when he first saw the completed movie, he ranted on Twitter about how much he hated it. Critics had pointed out that the relationship shown in the film, between his character and du Pont's, has 'homosexual undertones'. This is what upset Schultz the most; but he later apologized for his harsh words and now says he loves the movie. I think there is some homosexuality, implied in the film, but like everything else, in the movie, it's very ambiguous. That's what I kind of like most about it; it's very dark and creepy but nothing is spelled out for the viewer. I think almost everything, in the film, is left up to an individual's interpretation. Miller has said he was trying to show a ""narrative of a cult""; with the characters and situations being studied in the movie. I think it's all very fascinating and well made. It's maybe a little too slow paced and seemingly uneventful, at times, but it does have a powerful payoff. Carell really did an amazing job transforming himself into the role; and he does deserve all of the acclaim he's been getting. Tatum is pretty good as well but he seems more naturally fitting to his role; so it doesn't seem like it was as big of a stretch for him to do. Ruffalo is good, like always, but no better than he normally is, in my opinion. It's an all around well made film. Probably not one of the very best of the year, but a pretty good one all the same.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/O9KTvaLDibs"

","There is not much talking but this disturbing story based on real events is told in a very compelling way.<br/><br/>The central characters are two brothers who won Olympic gold medals in wrestling and a multi-millionaire heir to the Du Pont empire, portrayed brilliantly by Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell. The younger brother is fully focused on his training for the next Olympics, 1988 Seoul, and is excited to accept an offer of the eccentric philanthropist to train at his state-of-the-art facility. It is an opportunity for him to get out of the shadow of his older brother who was always in charge. The motives of John Du Pont are slowly coming into focus through his increasingly disturbing behaviour conveyed by Steve Carell in a haunting fashion.<br/><br/>This is not an action-packed movie but the storytelling is real, with just a glimpse into the world of wrestlers. Superb acting by Channing Tatum in a very different role than his usual. He does not have much dialog but he makes up for it in a lot of blank stares. And it took me a while to even recognize Steve Carell as he flawlessly portrayed the slimy and cold narcissist. A very comical scene when Du Pont coaches his protégé to pronounce an introduction of his benefactor as ""Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist"".<br/><br/>The tension builds up and soon you come to expect that it would blow up. In the end there is a climax (I will not reveal it in case you don't know the story).<br/><br/>I give it 9 out of 10."

This got nothing but good reviews about how amazing of a movie and how fantastic the acting is. I thought the acting of the big three (Carell, Tatum, and Ruffalo) were truly great. I enjoyed watching them in much different roles than I'm used to.<br/><br/>The problem for me is that while impressive, the characters themselves aren't likable. The only likable character is Ruffalo who isn't the main part of the story for the first hour or so. The first hour is about Carrell and Tatum and what Carell's character Du Pont wants to accomplish. This part is boring and what he wants isn't something that makes you fix your eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, without the tragic ending this entire movie would be pointless. It's a disturbing portrayal by Carell and like I said before, he delivers a perfect performance, it's just the entire story as a whole is too slow. It also doesn't mention that before the ending that 6 years had passed or the fact that Du pont is a schizophrenic.<br/><br/>People will probably disagree with my opinion, but I found this way too slow and uninteresting. Acting is great, story is slow and in the end tragic."
"howard.schumann","9","5","14","3 December 2014"," A powerful experience that winds us in a knot
","Based on a true story that made headlines in the late 1990s, Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher is a superb psychological drama that features Oscar-worthy performances from Channing Tatum as an emotionally repressed Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler, Mark Ruffalo as his supportive brother, and a barely recognizable Steve Carell, playing a scion of one of America's wealthiest families. With a screenplay by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, the film brings to life the tragic consequences of an emotionally dependent relationship built on psychological control and delivers it with relentless tension.<br/><br/>Three years after winning a gold-medal in wrestling at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) has lost none of his physical attributes but much of his self esteem. Poor and unrecognized, he lives alone in an apartment, eats fast foods, and ekes out a living giving lectures to elementary grade school students. His brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic champion wrestler, has provided much of the emotional support Mark requires but now lives in Colorado with his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and their two children, Danielle (Samara Lee) and Alexander (Jackson Fraser). Mark's life is rebooted, however, when he receives a call from John du Pont (Steve Carell), a wrestling enthusiast and a member of the one of the wealthiest families in America.<br/><br/>Du Pont asks Mark to come to his 800-acre estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania to train a wrestling team capable of winning gold at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. The eccentric du Pont, who lost his parents at a young age, lives with his elderly mother (Vanessa Redgrave), a horse breeder who looks down at wrestling as a ""low"" activity. Convinced by the huge sum of money he is offered and eager to emerge from his brother's shadow, Mark readily agrees and is flown first class to Pennsylvania to help in his mentor's stated goal of training a winning Olympics wrestling team and maintaining America's prestige. Du Pont has something to prove to himself and tells Mark, ""Coach is father. Coach is mentor. Coach has great power on an athlete's life."" Though Mark is happy living in the estate's opulent guest house, he wants his brother to come to Pennsylvania and bring his family, but Dave is unwilling to uproot his family and break his commitment to his job. Asked to give John personal wrestling lessons and perhaps perform other duties that are hinted at but not mentioned, the relationship between the teacher and his student begins a downward spiral when Mark is offered and begins to use Cocaine. With a military tank on his estate for sport and a gun in his pocket that he fires into the ceiling during a practice session, to say that du Pont is strange is like saying vampires prefer their meat slightly undercooked.<br/><br/>As Mark's physical abilities on the mat begin to deteriorate, DuPont calls him an ""ungrateful ape"" slapping him across the face. Out of concern for his brother, Dave is enticed to come to the estate, but an undercurrent of suppressed emotion and resentment re-escalates the tension, leading to an unforeseen tragedy. Though understated and deliberately paced, Foxcatcher is a powerful experience that winds us in a knot then challenges us to make sense of what is left unsaid.<br/><br/>Though the film does not have an overt political agenda, it illuminates the consequences of distorted values arising from a feeling of entitlement. du Pont could easily stand for the mindset of the privileged few who think that power and love are commodities they can buy on the open market and expect the rest of us to defer to them obsequiously. Unfortunately, many do."

This movie had potential to go in many meaningful directions but as soon as it seamed like it was going somewhere it would stop dead in its tracks and change course. In the end I couldn't draw a single point or lesson or meaning from any character or event in the movie. It was just a very tragic tale that seemed to all be for nothing at all. It gave no conclusion to any of the characters. It even showed a very emotional ending very awkwardly, not focusing at all on any of the 3 major characters.<br/><br/>The only positive is that the acting by Channing Tatum, Steve Carrel, and Mark Ruffalo were all very good. However, the screenplay did not really write a lot of emotions into their characters. The main emotion I kept feeling was just awkwardness throughout the movie. Channing Tatum's character was always angry and resentful and it did not really dig into great detail as to what shaped his character to be like that. They didn't explore the relationship between the Schultz brothers, except in the very beginning and it just skimmed the surface. Overall it was a confusing mess for the audience and you are left not knowing what you are meant to feel or think by the writers and the director.

"runamokprods","9","4","11","16 January 2015"," A deeply chilling and disturbing tone poem of a film.
","I can't remember when a non-horror film has made me feel so uncomfortable and tense for it's whole length. It's a quiet film. Slow. Subtle. Almost dreamlike. Much of what happens occurs without dialogue. But there is always a heavy feeling of doom floating over it's sad characters. <br/><br/>And what a fascinating bunch of characters. Based on real people, I found myself wondering if a novelist could come up with a trio so laden with emotional and social meaning. <br/><br/>John DuPont (Steve Carrell) is the mega millionaire who is vaguely 'off', and clearly fighting mental demons. He dreams of being a wrestling coach and somehow coaching America to glory, so he essentially buys a now down on his luck ex-champion Mark Shultz (Channing Tatum) to come and wrestle for him. The two men have a complicated and tricky relationship. There is admiration, father and son bonding, resentment and even seemingly unspoken sexual attraction. But neither man is able to communicate about almost any of it, or deal with any of the feelings themselves. <br/><br/>The third member of the triumvirate is Shultz's older brother Dave (Mark Rufflao). Less of a painful introvert than his brother, Dave has been Mark's coach and only friend. They have a complex filial relationship, captured beautifully by director Bennett Miller and writers Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye in the lengthy, almost wordless opening scene where Dave leads Mark through a training session. Just as messy, if healthier, than Mark's relationship with DuPont, we see in the scene the love, admiration, jealousy and rivalry that exists between these two quiet men. <br/><br/>Now Dave joins Mark at DuPont's vast compound to be 'assistant coach' to DuPont's 'coach', which is deeply bizarre as it quickly becomes clear that Dave knows 10 times as much about both wresting and leadership as DuPont ever will. As we watch a frustrated DuPont quietly head into an ever darker place the tension grows as thick as in a Polanski film, and even the film's conclusion provides little in the way of release. I headed back out into the night with a knot still in my stomach. It's the rare film that can pull me into that kind of claustrophobic space of madness and loss.<br/><br/>A word has to be given to the tremendous work done by all three actors, along with Vanessa Redgrave as DuPont's mother -- unforgettable in a role that only gives her a few minutes of screen time. While Carrell has gotten the lion's share of the kudos (and he is terrific, reinventing himself as a purely dramatic actor) both Tatum and Ruffalo also do world class work here, creating inarticulate men who express with their eyes and bodies what they don't quite know how to express with words.<br/><br/>This is not a 'fun' movie, but it is one that you can feel deeply, and end up pondering the nature of madness, success, the American dream, family in a way too few American films do."

There is a dreaded sense of buildup through each scene that concludes in the most unlikeliest of endings. The three main actors here give sensational performances particularly Steve Carell as the terrifying John Du Pont. up to now Carell has done solid work in the Comedy side of things but it seems with this mesmerizing performance we may see more good things to come from Carell.<br/><br/>As for Channing Tatum hes pulled quite possibly the biggest surprise of the year with his performance.

Its a shame he hasn't been recognized by the awards season for his fantastic work in Foxcatcher like Ruffalo and Carell have.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is undoubtedly one of the finest movies made this year.

","You know when you eat something that you think ""This food has to be tasty"" but then realize, ""Actually this is kinda blah""? In film, that's Foxcatcher.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher has solid performances from all three of its leading actors and the film's content has 'oscar bait' written all over it. The cinematography is decisive and adds to the film's mood and for a bit you might think Foxcatcher is a prestigious film worthy of the nominations it's garnering – you might be mistaken.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is Mark Schultz, an Olympic gold medalist in the sport of men's wrestling. His life greyly drones along as he trains with his brother and fellow athlete Dave, played by Mark Ruffalo. Dave's life is changed substantially when multimillionaire and philanthropist John du Pont (Steve Carrell) invites Dave to train at his estate in Pennsylvania Foxcatcher Farms.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a dramatic examination of the people behind the events that unfold during this time period for the Schultz brothers. It is depressingly taciturn and does not embellish the moments in this real men's lives. Though it should be noted the film takes several liberties in manipulating the time frame in which these events take place to their whim for narrative effect and is detrimental to the film's biographical integrity. Bennett Miller's direction of E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman's screenplay is starkly ambiguous and provides no illumination or psychological evaluation into the characters motives. In fact, the film's makers manage to strip some layers away from the characters' personalities to make them more of an awkward every-man.<br/><br/>While I understand the final effect the film Foxcatcher is going for, it simply misses the mark for me. There is not nearly enough content in the story itself in the way the film is told and its pacing is abysmally unbalanced. Foxcatcher just drily brings to the life the story that occurred in 1996 and could have done so in thirty minutes rather than two hours. It's climax is weak, uninspired and cliché.<br/><br/>It is like Foxcatcher is trying to be significant and to use the Schultz brothers as a mirror to speak of a greater message, but unsuccessfully.

I understand why a movie was made depicting the circumstances associated with the Schultz brothers and Dupont, but why was this movie made? Sure, sometimes movies/writers/directors have a story/direction in mind, but in the end it doesn't come into fruition for whatever reason. In this instance, it's like, what the f__k was the director thinking? He was alright with this? I would imagine that the actual events associated with Foxcatcher should make for an interesting story and I'd really like to see that movie, so how did they end up with this bomb of a movie? The fact that some people rated this movie well is an interesting psychological experiment that is worth looking into... it's some type of psychological defect or something that tricks people into thinking something crappy was good? Who knows, but this is not a good movie in any way.<br/><br/>The movie given to us is about nothing. Sure, Dave Schultz got shot by Dupont, but why? Even if no theories exist and/or no one knows the answer to that. This movie gives us nothing in reference to anything, including substance. Why was Mark pissed off at Dupont for the later half of the movie? Sure, Dupont was weird and everything... trying to present himself as the coach and having the wrestlers echo this sentiment, but for Mark to be enraged at both Dupont and his brother to the point where he is apparently so traumatized that he goes mute for the last 1/3rd of the movie... there's really only one conclusion one can come too. If that never happened, then one thing is for certain... if Mark wasn't taking it in the rear from DuPont this movie more than made up for it. I'd be surprised if Mark wasn't enraged after watching this movie."

","Bennett Miller's wonder is primarily a psychological study of exceptional characters portrayed superbly by Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. Based on a true story of brethren Mark and Dave Schultz, the story is an account of how their lives changed when they encountered the richest man in the United States who promised to support Mark in winning the Olympics. <br/><br/>You have to present a standing ovation to Steve Carell's makeup artists. The job they did with his prosthetic nose and a complete makeover is highly commendable. The character build up is so brilliant that it is quite next to impossible to figure out that Steve's behind the mask! The posture, the walk, the talk, the demeanour, everything is just marvelously put on by Steve and he perfects it at every frame. Channing Tatum is equally ravishing with a constant tough-boy lower lip countenance that he carries throughout. Mark Ruffalo is simply outstanding. The acting pro plays Mark's elder brother to perfection. There is so much going on on his face that you could almost read it. Miller's direction is one of the best I have ever seen. He keeps us engaged with long shots of a particular expression something that every drama thrives on. The editing of the movie could have however gone better since there were many dispensable shots strewn all across. Rob Simonsen and Michael Danna did a great job with the composition which Miller played only when required. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>As the frames run towards the inception of the flick, the movie gradually eases into the concept behind the movie moniker 'Foxcatcher', subtly remarking its historical significance. We witness a herd of men on horses on hunting grounds with hounds chasing foxes speaking of their affluence. Then begins the flick with Mark's routine and Dave's flair. <br/><br/>Soon we are introduced to the great John Du Pont a character so brilliantly woven, that it makes it hard to see through him. John's constant endeavor to prove himself to his mother is wonderfully depicted. Amongst some great scenes from the movie are John's frequent outbursts (Watch out for that gun bit!), Channing's hitting himself in wrath, Mark's exceptional efforts to help his brother, wrestling moves that Mark and Dave perfected and of course the unexpected climax. The drama reeks of human passion, psychology, fraternal concern, mental disputes and effects of strain in relationships. A perfect drama that Miller perfects owing to exceptional acting prowess shown by Steve, Mark and Channing."
"LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt","7","2","4","22 February 2015"," This 'fox' is a little too sly for it's own good.
","Bennett Miller is a top-notch director. Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum, Steve Carrell are very good actors. <br/><br/>So, there you have it. A fine director and three very able actors. And a true story to drive it all home. <br/><br/>This is first off, not a 'Sport' movie. The wrestling is significantly sidelined. It does follow the story of Mark Schultz, the 1984 Olympic Gold medalist in wrestling, but focuses a lot more on the turbulent and downright obnoxious relationship that Mark shared with Coach John Du Pont. This is primarily, a psychological drama. And as most such movies go, it is slow. So if you are looking for a sport movie, this is not likely to appease you. <br/><br/>Now, knowing the nature of the film, we move onto the performances. Channing Tatum shows commendable acting prowess, and plays his role very seriously, having no doubt put in a lot of effort into immersing himself into the character. But, I did feel that he was ineffective in showing any wide range of emotions, and had a constant 'pout'(if I may call it that) throughout the film. From the very first frame to the very last, his expression hardly ever changes, so he does rub off as pointlessly grumpy. Steve Carrell steals the show in this movie, hands down. He plays a disturbed and maniacal old man to perfection. Mark Ruffalo as Dave Schultz is the 'life' of the movie. He's fun and engaging and nails every emotion there is. <br/><br/>The direction is meticulous and it is easy to see that a lot of thought and effort has gone into the making of each scene. Silence is used very effectively in this film, especially one scene involving Tatum exercising furiously in a black hood, is silently impacting. <br/><br/>What works for this movie is its direction and performances. What doesn't is its unrelenting desire to be dark and brooding at all times. At one point, I literally felt like shaking Tatum's head and shouting at him to just speak a few words and tell us what his pout is all about. At the end, the story takes you by storm, and is undoubtedly the most impactful moment in the film. But still, too much is left unclear. You might say that the director deliberately abstained from coming to any conclusions or taking any sides, but to have seen two hours of slow character build-up, with little to nothing actually happening on screen, we're left with the distinct feeling that there was more to the story than was revealed to us. You're left wanting more because nothing much happened for a lot of the movie, and too much happened in the last few minutes. It leaves the actions of the people involved open to interpretation, but is ineffective in having a lasting impact on the observer. I think this movie was too subtle, in everything from the conveying of emotion, to the elucidation of each character's inner thoughts, to the portrayal of deceit and deception, all of which inhibit the viewer from actually being a part of proceedings.<br/><br/>And so, I felt a little bit let down. There's hardly any wrestling. There are no feelings of triumph and glory associated with sport. There is an end that could have provided closure and rounded off the movie well, but it is deliberately left for dead.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a good movie, but not great. It wants to show, but not tell. It wants to reveal, but not actually make us feel. That is both the reason for it's success and the ultimate reason for it's demise."

","Another this year's Oscar hopeful right before the Oscar night (although up to this moment, it is more likely to be an also-ran in all its 5 nominated categories), Bennett Miller tackles another sport after MONEYBALL (2011, 6/10), his similarly-fated Oscar players. This time it is about wrestling,FOXCATCHER recounts the infamous USA murder case of DavidSchultz (Ruffalo), an Olympic wrestling champion, shot dead by the billionaire John Du Pont (Carell with a fake nose and aged make-up), who started the Team Foxcatcher to sponsor and train national wrestling team for the Olympics, where David was the assistant coach of the team. <br/><br/>Actually the main story here is about David's younger brother, Mark Schultz (Tatum), also an Olympic champion in 1984, who is firstly recruited by John in 1987 as the promising athlete aiming for gold in the upcoming Olympic Games in Seoul, they form a twisted coach-and- trainee relationship (which reminiscent of this year's another Oscar contender WHIPLASH 2014, 9/10) with a pungent insinuation on latent homosexuality (don't tell me the scenes where a half-naked Mark shaving for John is a common picture in straight men's fraternities), while Mark is an impressionable youngster who is exalted to find the like- mindedness and camaraderie with the richest man in American (he is an Olympic champion who is failed to be honored by his country); it is John Du Pont, who is a damaged good inside despite of all his superior facades, he is not a professional coach, just a super-rich dilettante bearing an unquenchable passion for wrestling, also he is often under the influence of his feeble but noble mother (a sterling cameo by the venerable Redgrave), who dismisses his passion-of-life as being ""low"" (as opposite of hers, raising horses). Miller overtly suggests right after that humiliation, John impulsively vents his rage on Mark and called him an ingrate ape, which ignites the fuse of their ultimate falling-out, things further deteriorate when John finally employs David in his team (a belated move as it will turn out that David is the right coach for Mark), but at that moment, their relation turns sour since it is John who previously encourages him to get out of the shadow of his brother, so Mark feels alienated and belittled, he builds the tension both with John and David, finally he fails in the competition and is dropped out of the team soon afterward.<br/><br/>It has always been a mystery of John's motivation to murder David, and Miller as always, doesn't opt to spoon-feed his audience with a clear answer, or dramatize the sensation to be impressive, only leaves his clues among his muted-palette frames with undivided aplomb. So my take is that the murder is John's revenge to his failed liaison with Mark, in his mind, everything goes awry after David arrives, and he is too blind to realize that he is actually the culprit who causes the fiasco, he becomes paranoid and believes that David is behind all this, and should pay for the consequences, thus, in a word, John is an delusional lunatic, doesn't deserve any sympathy or redemption, an expensive price to pay to being that rich. <br/><br/>Carrell elevates himself into the elite club of an comedian-turned-Oscar-nominee (Jim Carrey should cry in his bathroom) thanks to such a hyped physical transformation, he is quite impressive to deliver the unnerving vibe which always hides underneath his condescending pompousness, adeptly mocks a self-claimed patriot who has a distorted soul inside without inducing any untimely comic effect, this man is a serious thespian! His fellow Oscar nominee, Ruffalo, is pitch-perfect too, who can be more sympathetic as a loving brother and an eventual victim played by the unassuming Mr. Ruffalo? One highlight is the grapple with Tatum near the beginning, both display tremendous corporeal endeavor to prepare their roles as wrestling pros, meanwhile Miller and his DP Greig Fraser capture the unspoken tension brilliantly which even makes a wrestling layman like myself feeling captivated. <br/><br/>However, to be perfectly frank, Tatum is the one who gives a more admirable performance and a more accomplished character building, although Mark is dumbed down as a walking ape without any sophisticated depth in his mind, quite ""a canary in a coal mine"", a measurement of how volatile John Du Pont is, Tatum comes off as a riveting presence from the beginning when he is ill-treated by the society, being socially awkward, seething with spleen and dissatisfaction; with his protruding jaw (more noticeably in his profile) and the chunky unwieldiness, he certainly goes out on a limb to defy all his previous screen charisma to impersonate a character not entirely up his alley, and this is so-called ""a breakthrough performance"" any young actor aspires to prove to his audience. <br/><br/>MONEYBALL may not grow on me, but FOXCATCHER can easily boost up my confidence towards Miller, after his stunning (non-documentary) feature debut CAPOTE (2005, 9/10), if he can keep working on tantalizing material like this, soon he will find his own keystone as a cinematic auteur with his own fingerprint of handling dark elements with distinguished composure and patience."

","I must be completely honest and admit that I didn't know the Schultz brothers story at all before watching Foxcatcher, so it was a completely clean slate for me.<br/><br/>The obvious things to note are the performances from Carell, Tatum and Ruffalo. All are brilliant in their own way. Carell as the eccentric billionaire who becomes more and more haunting as the film develops. Tatum as the talented wrestler who struggles to step outside of his brother's (Ruffalo) shadow. And Ruffalo as the older brother who tries to hold down a family life while coaching in Team Foxcatcher. Carell and Vanessa Redgrave also have a couple of scenes together which excellently highlight their fractious relationship and point towards why DuPont is like he is.<br/><br/>I found the film quite a slow burner, but far from boring. You could sense a dark undertone the whole way through the film, and tensions building. I did feel the ending was a bit abrupt and maybe the ramifications of Carell's actions weren't explored to the extent that they might have been.<br/><br/>The score is sensational, and almost tells a story in itself as you sense the movie taking a more macabre tone towards the end.<br/><br/>All in all, a very solid psychological drama, hitting all the harder knowing that it is based on a true story."

","Steve Carell is really good as the enigmatic John du Pont, a millionaire who takes the Schultz brothers - a duo of American Olympic wrestling champions under his wing. Channing Tatum is pretty wooden as Mark with Mark Ruffalo much better as his sibling David. The story focuses more on the erratic, downright selfish behaviour of du Pont as he desperately seeks some sort of validation which; despite his enormous wealth, he needs more than anything from his contemporaries. The brothers become little more than his pawns, and soon it all begins to impact on their wellbeing and sanity - not to mention their success as sportsmen. The story is interesting, but there's no getting away from the rather mediocre performance from Tatum. Vanessa Redgrave pops up occasionally as Jean du Pont (the mother) and at times Bennett Miller almost had me invest enough in the pair to care; but in the end I just didn't - and at over 2 hours it started to become more of a marathon to watch than to run."

","Foxcatcher delves into the true story of the murky John du Pont, the endlessly wealthy yet under-achieving son of America's infamous du Pont dynasty, and whose obsession with the sport of wrestling sees him buy his own team with hopes of training them to Olympic glory.
Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, an upcoming star keen to step out of his brother-come-coach David's (Mark Ruffalo) shadow and moves onto the du Pont estate as his prized trophy sportsman.
But when Tatum fails to live up to du Pont's expectations, the unnerving millionaire brings his brother on board to whip the team into shape, but as David begins to take over the team and question the change in his younger brother, du Pont marks him as a disposable barrier to his reputation.
Steve Carrell's transformation into du Pont extends beyond his sizeable prosthetic nose, with his dead eyes patrolling his staff and darkly irking those he desperately tries to impress and influence while Ruffalo, with his patient manner and humility, was the perfect choice to honour the memory of David Schultz.
The real Mark Schultz's recent furore in the press was unneeded, with the film offering no real suggestion that his relationship with his wealthy benefactor was sexual in any way.
In actuality, Foxcatcher comes down hard on Du Pont's distant mother, suggesting her life-long disproval of her son is to blame for his emotionless ambition and, ultimately devastating, disregard for human feeling."

","This is a deliberately paced movie that examines the relationship between 1984 Olympic medalist Mark Shultz and John Du Pont, of the Du Pont family. I have not read the book on which the movie is based and was only aware of the basic facts of what transpired back in 1988. I think some reviewers who rated this under a 5 thought it was going to be a feel good sports movie or action pic (I guess because Channing Tatum is in it). It's really a character study of two deeply flawed men, one of whom is so unable to grasp reality he commits murder. I thought the acting was very good by all, with Steve Carrell almost unrecognizable as Du Pont, and Tatum and the wonderful Ruffalo very sympathetic. (I have to admit Carrell does seem somnulent at times, and the pacing could have been tightened in early scenes). The biggest weakness of the movie is that it really doesn't reveal the extent of Du Pont's psychosis before the murder occurs. Although it's clear that he is grieving the loss of his relationship with Mark--and Du Pont was definitely not ""all there"" to begin with--there was a missed opportunity to build up suspense after Mark left. A previous reviewer questioned why Mark Shultz had become upset with Du Pont--do people watch the movie before writing their reviews?? Du Pont had been encouraging and flattering, crafting a sense of intimacy that Mark lacked in his life, then started directing the venom he had for his mom toward Mark. When he told Mark off and slapped his face in front of the team, he tore down Mark's authority. Du Pont then insisted Mark's brother Dave come to coach, when Du Pont had previously given Mark a pep talk about not needing to feel inferior to his brother. Plus he'd introduced Mark to cocaine, and as Mark's athetic performance started to suffer he spiralled down into deep depression and had a mental breakdown. So no hard feelings there (!). Anyway, it seemed like brother Dave was doing a decent job smoothing things over, then...well, I would highly recommend viewing the documentary Fox Catcher for more insight into Du Pont."

The film begins after their wins as they are pursued to live and train in a sports community owned by eccentric mega-millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell).<br/><br/>It is easy to distinguish this as an independent film as opposed to a typical Hollywood film. A Hollywood film would likely have ended with the Olympic glory with the final victory in slow motion (including the audience jumping to its feet) with a blaring orchestra. Instead, ""Foxcathcher"" shows a very deglamourized life (especially Mark's) post-Olympics, bravely showing the flip-side of the Olympic dream.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller uses a story-telling style that is deliberately bleak and emotionally distant. This mood is best shown in Carell's performance which is subtle and repressed as he portrays someone who, most of his life, was given too much money and not enough love. The only warmth in the film comes from Ruffalo whose character has found happiness with his young family.<br/><br/>The bleak style is fine but up to a point as the movie feels too long a 2.25 hours.

","Invited to train for the Seoul Olympics at a facility run by an eccentric millionaire, a young wrestler struggles to maintain his sanity in this downbeat but engrossing drama based on a true story. The project is carefully directed by Bennett Miller who deliberately paces the material with many elongated silent shots of the protagonist just sitting around and contemplating. This might not sound particularly interesting, but with Channing Tatum in solid form as the wrestler in question, all these non-action based moments give us a great glimpse into his mind. Steve Carell is also excellent in a supporting turn (the BAFTAs got the category correct) as the mysterious millionaire with an unspoken hidden agenda. On one hand, it is a little underwhelming how the dynamics of Carell and Tatum's friendship are only ever implied with only some suggestion of Carell liking Tatum as more than just a friend; on the other hand, there is a lot to admire in how Miller leaves it up to our imagination regarding the highs, lows and rifts between the pair. Mark Ruffalo is also terrific as Tatum's brother, though he is far less subdued. Providing far more questions than answers regarding what occurred between the real life Mark Schultz and John Du Pont, 'Foxcatcher' does not necessarily offer the most satisfying narrative out there, but there is much to like in how moody and unsettling an experience it is."

","FOXCATCHER is a film I knew nothing about when I sat down to watch it and I think that's the best way to go. Certainly if you know the events of what really happened - this is a true story - then it will spoil the experience. I knew nothing and watched the tale unfold at a leisurely pace, finding myself drawn into the lives of the characters even though the subject matter bored me.<br/><br/>In essence, this is a tale about two wrestling brothers, one of whom is sponsored by a millionaire eccentric to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. There's no more story to it than that. This is a slow, character-focused drama that probably could have used some judicious cutting to excise some of the more repetitive moments; still, there are a couple of powerful set-pieces that really work and make it worth watching.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is well chosen for the main role; I've never liked the actor but he convinces as the wrestling meat head here. An unrecognisable Steve Carell garnered all the attention for playing the kooky oddball and he's certainly very good, but my favourite performance was Mark Ruffalo who gives an excellent performance once again. Just as in ZODIAC and SPOTLIGHT, Ruffalo plays a quiet and intensely sympathetic character full of nuance and realism. It makes me wish he'd make more great thrillers instead of wasting his time in token comic book fare."
"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","8 October 2016"," It's time to weigh-in on this movie. Is it good? I'm wrestling with that question. It was alright, I guess. It's worth the catch.
","Ripped-from-the headlines, this movie turns real-life events into a compelling psychological portrait of power and class struggle, with Olympic wrestling as a backdrop. It made for a very interesting watch. However, without spoiling the movie, too much, my big problem with the movie is how much of the events, the writers, E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman change for the sake for story-telling. Directed by Bennett Miller, the movie tells the story of Olympic gold medalist wrestler, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his business relationship with billionaire/wrestling enthusiast John Du Pont (Steve Carrell) on their attempt to build a wrestling camp at Pont's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, without the help of Mark's successful brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). However, in real-life, Mark didn't move to Foxcatcher to build a wrestling camp for Du Pont, but instead, Du Pont wanted him to be the assistant coach at Villanova University. Prior to accepting John Du Pont's invitation, Mark had been fired from his assistant coaching position at Stanford. He went to Foxcatcher only to live there in 1986. Also, in real life, Du Pont wanted Mark's brother Dave more than himself. After all, Jon first contacted Dave to coach, who in turn recommended Mark. Another thing, neither of the brothers were living at Foxcatcher, at the same time, like this movie was trying to say. In real life, Mark Schultz left Foxcatcher in 1988 and his brother Dave didn't arrive until 1989. Don't get me wrong, I kinda like this change, as it adds tension between the brothers over the right to coach the Foxcatcher team, but I know, for fact, that there was barely any sibling rivalry. Mark never felt overshadowed by his older brother. In truth, they trained together and really supported each other from a very young age. Both Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo did however, show well that they could handle some tension, while also, showing that they honest do love each other. It made for a very compelling watch. Another thing, the movie add was the sexual tension between Du Pont and Mark. While it was implied by the filmmakers, that some sexual advances did happen between them; nobody for sure, knows, if it did. Mark Schultz has stated out that, while Du Pont and he, indeed did cocaine, together; he didn't have any relationship with John Du Pont, besides business and drug use. However, I found out, by research that Du Pont might not have been as asexual as folks make it out to be. Indeed, John Du Pont was married at one time. His own 1983 marriage dissolve after cases of domestic abuse came into light. Then, there were other abuse cases that was push under the rugs; such was the case of Andre Metzger, a Villanova University wrestling coach who said that he was fired because he had refused Du Pont's homosexual advances and suffer beatings. While, the movie doesn't mention about it. Du Pont indeed had a very close relationship with Bulgarian wrestler, Valentin Jordanov at the time as well; to the point that Jordanov was part of his will, when he died in 2010. While, Valentin wasn't really needed for this part of the story, I just wish, the movie explore more of the business relationship between Jon and Dave. I never really got, the reasons, why Dave was willing to work with Jon, besides feeding his kids. The movie doesn't explore Dave's dream to capture Gold in the 1992 Olympic Games. The film really does gloss over it. Nor does the movie explore the depths of Jon's insanity that much. It was somewhat a letdown for the film, not to show his paranoia. Crazy real-life events like Du Pont sending wrestlers like Kevin Jackson & Trevor Lewis into his attics walls to look for ghosts, using dynamite to destroy a den of fox cubs, driving his car into a pond, twice, or pointing a gun, and burning down, a house to force, wrestler, Dan Chaid out of his house, should had been added to the film. Nor does the movie talk about the amount of hunting that went on, throughout the farm. It really could had add, so much, more thrilling parts, since it deals with weapons. Nor does the movie show that Du Pont's love for swimming, track, and the modern pentathlon. Wrestlers weren't the only athletes to train at Foxcatcher. Where are their stories about Jon Du Pont!? It would make the movie, a lot scarier. Yes, I know that would make the film seem a little more predictable, but the failure to add these, makes the ending with Dave Schultz, seem out of place and forced. Movie should explore Dave's love for the Soviet Union style of living and Jon Du Pont's over-patriotism for America, and Dave wanting to leave Foxcatcher for Stanford more. Despite that, I think Steve Carrell really did a great job in the role. He was very mysterious, prideful and strange, adding a sense of danger with that of eerie melancholy and tragedy detachment to Jon Du Pont's persona. Foxcatcher works because of its three leads. Tatum displays a depth that hasn't been since, his previous undertakings. He really did surprised me, here, both in acting and physical presence. The mirror smashing scene is a great example, as Channing Tatum indeed cut his head open. Talk about dying for your craft. You really do believe that he was a wrestler. The same, goes with Mark Ruffalo in his performance. Both, train hard for these roles. I also love that the real Mark Schultz cameo in this film. Rob Simosen's score is equally as amazing. His score add with the camera work make the ending, so powerful. Although, that ending also, does make UFC look sleazy and low brow. Overall: Aggressively morose, bleak by design. This movie will be an unsettling ride that would wrestle with your soul for days after watching it. Worth watching."

","A very slow paced film that tells the story of a delusional and deranged wealthy man who believes he can be a hero among the wrestling community, A feat which he ultimately fails to do and in a fit of anger he tarnishes his family dynasty by heinously killing Dave Schultz, the older brother of legendary wrestler Mark Schultz. <br/><br/>This film is unique in its pacing and its dryness to the audience with much of the characters being very stern unemotional men who draw no real drama. That is a real challenge to put on the big screen but I feel they cast well and told the story with dignity if nothing more. <br/><br/>Steve Carrell has to be applauded for his Steller portrayal of the harsh and unusual John Du Pont, an eccentric rich man that has no friends and instead buys his way into the life's of others. Steve who is primarily known for his comedic roles captures John Du Pont so well that you completely forget it is in fact Steve who is playing the role. <br/><br/>Channing plays Mark Schultz to the best of his ability but other than athletically there really isn't much in the way of a great performance to be done.<br/><br/>The ending really was hard hitting and unexpected as John Du Pont callously murders Dave Schultz for no real reason other than the small matter of Dave not appearing on the video. For me this film leaves you with a certain feeling of emptiness and much of this I believe comes from the real lack of emotion in Foxcatcher. <br/><br/>The characters at times feel peculiar in the way they react or more likely don't react to certain things and it all just feels a little stale and lifeless in that regard. I almost feel bad for saying it but we really could have used that Hollywood dramatization to liven things up and keep you entertained until the shocking conclusion. <br/><br/>That being said I was never bored during the film and it did keep me watching all 2hr 15 min runtime but it did however feel like for the most part Foxcatcher was on the edge of a very thin line between entertainment and uninteresting. <br/><br/>Overall a pace that I didn't agree with but understood because of the story they had to work with, which at its height was intriguing and enlightening with great acting performances mainly from Steve Carrell but I do feel it could have been done better and with more drama, emotion and a better well rounded ending that focused on life after the shooting, I could have truly praised this film."

","I am a fan of movies that are based in actual events and/or true stories. For these films to be successful, in my estimation, the actors cannot resemble the person they are attempting to portray. Be it physically, verbally, or in their portrayal. I don't want to constantly remind myself that ""oh, Steve Carrell is John du Pont"" throughout the film. It's difficult to hold the thread of the story for me. That written, kudos to Steve Farrell for his portrayal of duPont. Aided through the use of prosthetics, it was easy to forget who the actor was and concentrate more on the actual story. The same really cannot be said of Channing Tatum. I'm not familiar with the resemblance Tatum would have had with Schultz. I just couldn't get past the actor. I agree that the film portrayed Mark Schultz as delayed or slow. I know that not to be the case. Further, the job of Vanessa Redgrave was executed quite well, as was Mark Ruffalo in portraying David Schultz. I found the film incredibly sad. Not in content, in the life of constantly seeking approval, having everything imaginable, yet not being happy with who you are. Not finding independent, healthy friendships and interests that could take away from the disappointing childhood and lack of affection. Overall, the film lagged, tremendously, to the point of being awkward at times."

","Good, slow-burning drama.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, in 1987 a Olympic Gold Medal-winning wrestler, Mark Schultz (played by Channing Tatum), is approached by a billionaire, John Du Pont (played by Steve Carell). Du Pont offers to coach him and a group of other wrestlers with the next Olympics in mind. They will stay at his estate, Foxcatcher. Soon, Schultz's brother, David (played by Mark Ruffalo), is also brought onboard, as an assistant coach. However, Du Pont may be harbouring some personal issues and demons...<br/><br/>Intriguing drama though quite slow in its development. Not dull - there's always enough happening to keep you interested. You get the feeling that something is going to happen, but you don't know how calamitous it will be... <br/><br/>This said, it does come close to being too slow and there are are signs as to what the conclusion is going to be, just the victim(s) isn't certain. The slow pace also gives you time to think about where everything is going, and this is a bad thing, as you can foresee some of the conclusion.<br/><br/>Surprising casting, and it works! Mark Ruffalo was no surprise as David - intellectual, character-driven drama is his bread-and- butter. He put in a solid performance and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.<br/><br/>No, the surprises are the inclusion of Steve Carell and Channing Tatum. Carell tends to do comedies and his performance here as the very complex and creepy Du Pont is quite a departure for him. Good work by him though, for which he was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Tatum usually stars in cheesy comedies, one-dimensional action movies and/or as eye-candy for females, so a serious drama is a leap for him too. He does get to play a slow-witted meathead here, so maybe not so much of a stretch for him. Good work in the role though.<br/><br/>Overall, intriguing though maybe a bit too drawn out. Still good though."

","Maybe the eastern bloc wanted to better their chances at the Olympic wrestling gold again. Targeting Du Pont with psychosis inducing drugs would have done the job. I wonder if any conspiracy theorists or even john himself have wondered if it was sabotage from their competition. The movie looks at a lot of different angles for how things went down at the du Pont farm and with this wrestling team. I think it is a pretty good explanation of things. And I don't mean to be disrespectful David Schultz' a life. I think the movie could have made more of a point to explain the reason this happened is because of an inability for many Americans to comprehend and treat rich people as equals. They think the rich are inherently good and better than the rest of others and give them too much leeway to trample on others rights. Rich people are humans just like everyone else and hanging around them for their money is not going to get you where you need to go. That said, it would have been interesting to see if the sabotage angle was ever discussed."

","I have been a fan of Bennett Miller since first seeing Moneyball. The trailers and cast list for Foxcatcher gave me an interest in seeing it and learning that it was a passion project for Bennett Miller gave me high hopes for the film. This film is truly a great showcase of brilliant cinematography, production design, and acting. Every performance in the film is fantastic and although the media and academy awards have shined the spotlight on Steve Carrell and Mark Ruffalo I found this film to be the breakthrough for Channing Tatum's dramatic career. Tatum gives this career defining performance as a darkly troubled and tormented Olympic Athlete who aspires for greatness. The narrative arc of the film seems a bit messy due to the large gaps of time in between major scenes of character or plot development. There are several scenes in the film that seem irrelevant, the pressure that has built up throughout several major scenes has somewhat dissipated the emotional engagement of the audience by the time the climax has arrived. Many average movie-goers will not be able to sit through the entire duration of the film due to the extremely slow burn to the climax and scenes that drag in the middle of the film. Overall it is still a good film with a great creation of visual atmosphere with interesting sound design to create an eerie environment that is unique in modern cinema."

","Miller made sure that he cooks up the character in such a way that you feel bad about a normal family guy who was trying to protect his brother and just keep him in focus. He made sure that you get on with the film once it starts and you feel bad and sorry for Mark and rest of the family. Nobody expects that to happen and it comes out as a shocker. There are various scenes which depicts different things but there is one scene in particular which I really liked. Its the time when John wakes Mark up in the morning for practice and then we see a close up shot of Mark and his face in disgust and it looks as if the two guys are having sex. But the director made sure that he didn't show it literally. That scene clearly depicts how John was f****ng with Mark's life. It clearly shows that John wants to take control of Mark and Mark couldn't do anything about it. The scene woke me up and I just felt for such a great wrestler. I know its fictional, but the way director summed up the whole scenario in that scene, one would feel bad for the guy for sure. The actors Steve Carrol, Mark Rufalo and Channing, all of them did a superb job and made sure that truth of the fictional story keeps the audience connected. Nobody likes sad endings and hence the last shot where Mark fights in a UFC battle and the crowd behind him leaves a mark on the mind of each viewer that ""NO MATTER WHAT, LIFE HAS TO GO ON."""

","This is not a bad film; problem is it should have been bloody great one. It is based on the real life shenanigans of John E. du Pont – one of America's richest men. He is so rich he can have and do whatever he wants and he wants to have his own wrestling team, and go to the Olympics in Seoul and win gold and him pretend to be the coach and get all the laurels like some latter day Roman Emperor a la mode of Nero oh and have a real friend. <br/><br/>He sets up a state of the art gym and lures two wrestling brothers, the Schultz brothers – played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to come and join his team called 'Foxcatcher'. Du Pont is played Steve Carell and all of them put in credit worthy performances and this must have been a very physical role. There is a lot of wrestling – the Roman – Greco sort not the sort that is basically bad choreography (but much more fun) and the need to be very emotional too.<br/><br/>The 'however 'here is that some scenes go on too long, even the so called scene setting at the beginning just goes on forever, this is 134 minutes long and there was so much that could have been cut that would have given this more immediacy – which is what is needed in a film that posits itself as a thriller – I would have called it a drama to be honest but that is a small point. This is still well worth watching but I think director Bennett Miller could have left a bit more on the editing suite floor as this story did not lend itself to 'lyrical delivery' as it is often euphemistically called and there was a lot more to the story that would have risen it higher in the entertainment ranks too especially about Du Pont, but that is always the choice of the makers."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","9 March 2015"," More of a character study than a sports movie
","""Foxcatcher"" was one of the big players at this year's awards season. Even if it finally came short at the Oscars and did not manage a win or nomination in the most crucial category, it was counted among the year's best in writing, directing and makeup. Two more nominations went to Carell and Ruffalo (especially glad for him, loved his interview scene when he was supposed to praise du Pont) for their portrayals. Also, director Bennett won the Palme d'Or for his work here. It's difficult to say what the best feature about this movie was, but especially the makeup work on Steve Carell deserves a mention. The screenplay comes from E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman. The latter is actually more of an actor, but has also received an Oscar nomination previously for Bennett Miller's ""Capote"". Another mentionable achievement for Miller is that he got his lead actors Academy Award nominations for all three movies he made (including a win for PSH) and 3 more nominations in the supporting categories.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this film here. The ending is really tough and even shocking if you know a bit about the story and what happened in the 1980s surrounding Team Foxcatcher and the eccentric John du Pont. If you don't know, it will probably blast you away. The by far most likable character from the film really got unlucky in the end. The center of this film are the relationships between the trio of male protagonists, but also between Carell's and Redgrave's character. How to be a good brother, a good coach, a good son etc. Tatum's character has always been in the shadow of his very successful older brother and when he finally finds a mentor who says his brother's time is over and it's the younger Schultz' time to shine, he is very delighted. As du Pont quickly changes his opinion and gets Ruffalo's character to Team Foxcatcher, the relationship between the younger brother and his mentor is irreparably damaged.<br/><br/>You could probably argue if Carell is lead here. To me, Tatum is the only true lead in this movie, but you could probably also make an argument for Carell as he is not as supporting as Ruffalo, especially as a big part of the film is about his relationship with his mother. Redgrave's quote about being low is maybe the most memorable from the film. It's funny in an embarrassing way how du Pont obviously bought wrestling events for over 50-year-olds in order to participate and be gifted the win, then let himself be celebrated like a hero. He may like the sport of wrestling, but all his involvement with it really only comes from his wealth. Away from him, the connection between the two brothers is extremely interesting. There is one scene in which Dave slaps Mark, then hugs him afterward. There is another scene when du Pont slaps Mark and then leaves right away. Good parallel here and we realize who the younger brother's true friend is.<br/><br/>I don't know if I would go so far and say this is one of the best films of the year, but it's a pretty good movie with three (to four) strong performances. I'm not interested at all into wrestling, but it's really only the frame of the story (like baseball in Miller's ""Moneyball""). I have to say though that I sometimes had difficulties to make out who is who when Tatum's character fought in the ring."

","While this movie is based on well-publicized actual events, an extra SPOILER is warranted as not every moviegoer is aware of these events.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" was the only major contender that I did not get a chance to see before Oscar Night. No one expected Steve Carell to win and he didn't. Yet most would agree that he was good enough to win but was unlucky to have bumped into such a strong field.<br/><br/>This biopic recounts the ultra-opulent yet grim life of John Eleuthere du Pont. More specifically it covers the later part of his life, past 50. One somewhat unusual thing here, for this type of movie, is that there is no flashback whatsoever of his earlier life, particularly childhood and teens. Whatever impact his earlier life had on this man we see in the movie is addressed subtly. I'll come back to this.<br/><br/>A movie on the sport of Olympic wrestling (a term I coined to differentiate it from the show business WTF) admittedly does not offer the same level of excitement the audience gets from its pugilistic counterparts. And yet, I find it just as enjoyable as (and sometimes even more than) boxing every time I watch the Olympics. The fluid, explosive lunges and the tenacious, gripping holds, at extreme ends of the motion spectrum, are equally mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple, an account of how in du Pont's obsession with this sport, he worked on building the team ""Foxcatcher"" to develop contestants for the U.S. Olympic team. This evolved into building on his opulent estate a training center for the U.S. team, culminating in its failure to capture the gold medal in Seoul. This eventually leads to the tragedy of his shooting the coach. His ultimate fate of dying in prison is mentioned via texts on the screen before the closing credits. This movie is essentially character-driven, as outlined below.<br/><br/>Playing du Pont's aged mother is inimitable Vanessa Redgrave whose distinguished facial features have not changed that much from her Guenevere in ""Camelot"" almost half a century ago. As I said earlier, influence on de Pont from his childhood days is covered only subtly. From Redgrave's expertly understated performance in just a few scenes, the formation of de Pont's neurotic character under the influence of his dominating mother is quite palpable.<br/><br/>While Redgrave is a minor support in terms of screen time, Channing Tatum is close to being a co-lead. He plays Mark Schultz who, under de Pont's mentorship, won the World Champion but stopped short of the Olympics. This is Tatum's most dramatic role to-date, one that he handled adequately. It may take some time, if he has the innate ability, for him to follow the footstep of Leonardo DiCaprio in the transformation from ""star"" to ""actor"".<br/><br/>All this is quite evident in that the Best Support nomination is given to Mark Ruffalo who has considerably less screen time playing the older of the Schultz brothers, David. While Mark Schultz may have huge potentials (as least in de Pont's eyes), it is David who is the established wrestling expert to whose guidance people generally attribute Mark's achievements. Du Pont naturally wants to have David on board but as Mark's cryptic comment aptly puts it ""You cannot buy Dave"". With his family as top priority, David is reluctant to have it uprooted by moving his wife and two kids to the Foxcatcher estates. Du Pont eventually succeeds in persuading him to do so, probably somehow convincing him that this is best for his family. As I have cited in many of my 1127 IMDb user reviews to-date, it is often the day-to-day roles with no glaringly unusual characteristics that are most difficult to play. David Schultz is a good example: successful athlete, devoted family man, loving older brother, which could have been any guy next door. Yet Ruffalo's Oscar nomination is fully deserved.<br/><br/>One support character, Sienna Millar as David Schultz's wife, I like to mention even if it minor in terms of both screen time and demand of the role. The interesting thing here is that Millar, in both of her two 2014 movies, played the wife of a man that is shot to death. Both actors she played against earned Oscar nominations. In ""American Sniper"", however, Chris Kyle's murder is not shown in the movie and so the audience is spared the agony of watching the wife clinging desperately onto the body of the dying husband, as in ""Foxcatcher"".<br/><br/>Steve Carell in ""Foxcatcher"" you can readily recognize in looks (although I suspect some work has been done to his nose) but not in persona. So much applauds have been bestowed on his brave step into a brand new area of acting that there is little I can add to what I have already said. The hidden, homicidal menace he projects well. As well, du Pont plays off one brother against the other, putting into Mark's mind (without resorting to inception!!!) the idea that living under the shadow of David has hindered the development of his own potentials. Through Carell's subtle, nuanced performance, the audience can sense how du Pont feels about his own potentials being crushed by his mother's dominance."

","The film is a good movie, but it could have been a great one . It centers on Olympic gold medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz and his brother Dave. Mark is struggling with a boring, lonely life, when he gets a call out of the blue from a billionaire who is heir to the Dupont fortune. The wealthy man wants to sponsor Mark, his brother and their amateur wrestling team as they live for free on his estate.<br/><br/>The film is good because it is an interesting biography, and because it has a slow, realistic pace. Some found it's pace dull but I liked it's dark realism.<br/><br/>The film could have been great, benefiting from both the interesting pace, and the fact that it is based on a fascinating , dramatic biography. However, it is brought down by caving to the PC masses as it portrays all the major characters in a typical stereotypical Hollywood way. It's as if the writers had a focus group whispering in their ears.<br/><br/>Most adult men are creepy and evil, unless they are chaperoned by a woman and children in which case they appear miraculously transformed. They become perfect, smiley faced drones, floating blissfully through life in a quest to serve their children. The ""family men"" are filled with confidence, wisdom, and self righteous dignity. It goes without saying that women and children are shown as flawless, rays of sunshine piercing an atmosphere foul darkness.<br/><br/>The two main male characters appear to be single, so of course they are shown to be at best creepy and at worst criminally insane. The filmmakers seem to be trying to be subtle in they're portrayal of Dupont as suspect, but I felt as though I was hit over the head with a hammer of overtones and innuendo. This follows the disturbing pattern in recent decades where any single adult male is shown negatively, something to be fearful of. <br/><br/>Dave and his family act as though they are filled with a self satisfying knowledge that they are at the top of the social food chain. No matter Dupont is paying all the bills and puts a roof over everybody's head, they talk to him so condescendingly that in every scene he manages to appear pathetic. Carell also does a good job acting, but almost goes overboard with the ""creepy"" as it is rare to encounter any guy this weird in real life. . The message the film seems to be tapping at with a jackhammer is - ""no matter how much money you have and give away , if you are an adult male you had BETTER KNOW YOUR PLACE"". ""family and kids good, men bad"".<br/><br/>I have read that Mark Schultz was dissatisfied with the way he was portrayed, and I don't blame him. Many who were there at Foxcatcher have been quoted saying the film was largely fictionalized, which is not a surprise. Movies today show sexual overtones to practically everything, so you never know if they were there in real life or they were added to sell tickets. <br/><br/>I wonder if the real personalities were more interesting than those fabricated for the film. We will never know because the film makers choose the easy way out. They pander to those who worship at the alter of the family and children as they show any single guy as an untrustworthy creep. Makes one wish for the old Gene Hackman or Clint Eastwood movies."

","The acting was emotional to say the least. I felt disturbed by the personalities that were being portrayed, and became more uncomfortable with the thought that they were real. It was a constant downhill ride as we followed the lives of the Schultz brothers. Being on the top and gliding to the foothill of success, was what this movie seemed to be entirely about. It was simply a man with no financial limit, who intended to live vicariously through individuals who excelled in a passion he could not. The life lessons imposed on this movie were the powers of temptation and pressure, and how mental stability can be in the form of winning and losing."

","The good. Steve Carrell played Du Pont fantastically well, and I felt that he really captured the distant and isolated nature of a complex character. Mark Rufallo played David very well although he wasn't given an awful lot to work with.<br/><br/>The bad. The film started extremely slowly, I appreciate we were meant to feel the pace of life for Mark Schulz between his sports career and his mundane home life but it was possibly over played. Plot avenues would open up, you'd steer that way and then BAM! It would be like a door slammed in your face, just as you were starting to think into it. There was never any further depth given to many if these side stories which initially always seemed like they were set up to play an important role in the story.<br/><br/>When things went sour between Mark and Du Pont there was never a look at either character thinking about it, or talking about it much and it left an unexplained void of seemingly random bitterness.<br/><br/>The way the film ended managed to stand out even more as being more especially terrible from the rest of the movie. After Mark leaves we see David continue his training camp in a few scenes and then the end game happens, all within quick succession - I was amazed to read later that there was actually over 7 years between these events!!<br/><br/>How this garnered multiple award nominations is beyond me and I feel it is undeserving of any with the exception of perhaps Carrell's performance."

","An isolated, pathetic heir convinces an Olympic wrestling star to utilise his wealth and resources in return for some reflected glory. When the flaws of the mentor seep into the mentored, the star's brother gets involved, with tragic consequences. Carrell has rightly been lauded for his beguiling performance of a deeply damaged individual whose access to power allows him to corrupt others. Looking small wandering around his vast property, having arid, brittle exchanges with his emotionless mother, he is both pitiful and sinister. Tatum also nails the immature, needy and therefore vulnerable younger brother. But it is Ruffalo who impresses most as the most conflicted character in the narrative. He wants to look after his brother, gain access to the benefits the mentor offers, and maintain a relationship with the mentor while keeping him at a safe distance. The complexities of all that are brilliantly captured by Ruffalo, who is fast taking character acting to new levels. E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman fashion an engrossing, tight narrative that crackles till it breaks. Based on a true story that it is best to know little or nothing about before watching."
"estebangonzalez10","8","3","9","25 January 2015"," Combining elements from Capote and Moneyball, Miller delivers a chilling psychological character study
","""You have a problem with me?""<br/><br/>If you thought Bennett Miller's Capote was a cold and distant crime thriller wait till you watch Foxcatcher because it is a very silent and slow paced psychological character study that explores some pretty interesting relationship dynamics along the way. I was captivated by this film and the atmosphere that Miller sets during its 134 minute runtime. I went into Foxcatcher completely unaware of the story it was based on, and I think that is why I may have enjoyed it a lot more than others who were already familiar with the story. This isn't your typical inspirational sport film, it is more concerned on studying the characters and you get an eerie sense that it is building into something much more than simply winning or losing a wrestling match. Miller's Capote was a crime thriller and he followed it with Moneyball which was a sports film centering on relationships, and in a way Foxcatcher is a combination of both those films. Miller is interested in telling real stories and exploring the characters behind them. Unlike Jolie's Unbroken where we get a sense that she is simply narrating a story where one event unfolds after another; Miller seems to be focused on the characters and their motivations. A lot of people might get bored with the slow pacing and somber tone of the film, but I was engaged with these characters fifteen minutes into the movie. There was a moment during the opening in which I felt the performances were a bit too actory or stagey, but once I got past that I was really invested in the psychological drama behind each one of the relationships. Miller has now directed three impressive films although this is his least approachable one.<br/><br/>There are some outstanding and creepy performances in this film, but the way in which the characters related to one another is what worked best for me. First of all you have these two brothers who've each won Olympic gold medals. Mark (Channing Tatum) is the youngest brother who seems to be sort of a social outcast living in the shadow of his older brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo) who is the more likable one. Dave also understands wrestling better and knows how to coach, while Mark is more muscles than anything else. They have a solid and caring relationship with one another, but there is some resentment in Mark. Their relationship changes when a multi-millionaire named John Du Pont (Steve Carell) enters in the picture. He is a wrestling aficionado and offers Mark the opportunity to come stay with him in his ranch and train in the facility he has built there. There is something offbeat with du Pont who is desperately searching for acceptance and recognition. Vanessa Redgrave plays his mother and despite not having much screen time her presence seems to have an effect on John who is seeking for her approval. There is something true about what Miller said when he referred to comedic actors as having something dark about them because Steve Carell pulls off a chilling performance as this eccentric millionaire who tries to become a role model for Mark. The problem is that du Pont isn't a coach, he is more of a sponsor, and without Dave Mark isn't that good of a wrestler. Tatum, Ruffalo, and Carell each give strong performances, which doesn't come as a surprise considering Miller directed each one of his lead actors to receive Oscar nominations in his previous films. The film relies heavily on their performances and they deliver. Carell receives most of the attention because he plays a creepy character who makes everyone around him feel uneasy at times (there is a homoerotic undertone to the film). The moments in which du Pont is trying to impress his mother by acting like he is guiding the wrestlers was the highlight of the film for me because no matter how much money this guy has you know he is desperate to be something he is not. Ruffalo is also outstanding and is given perhaps the most likable role in the movie, but Tatum is equally as good. Foxcatcher succeeds in most part due to those three strong lead performances and the way each one of these characters relates to one another."
"j-madej","8","3","9","15 January 2015"," Steve Carell's minimalistic performance is indeed Oscar worthy!
","Ever since I saw the first trailer, I had a very high, Oscar worthy expectations for this slow, but intense wrestling biopic drama the ""Foxcatcher"". There is a sense of underlined intensity throughout this film, that leads us to believe that the end might culminate in a violent crescendo as it indeed does.<br/><br/>""When wealthy John du Pont (Steve Carell) invites Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) to move to his estate and help form a wrestling team for the 1988 Olympics, Mark sees a way to step out of the shadow of his charismatic brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). However, du Pont begins to lead Mark down a dark road, causing the athlete's self-esteem to slip. Meanwhile, du Pont becomes fixated on bringing Dave into the fold, eventually propelling all three toward an unforeseen tragedy.""<br/><br/>In ""Foxcatcher"" the whole wrestling competition has a very heavy homo erotic undertone about it. Specially in the retrospect of the relationship between John du Pont and Mark Schultz. One is trying to be a father figure the other looking for guidance. As the film progresses there is something darker that develops between the two man, which will explain almost jealous like behavior of John du Pont towards his brother Dave and their relationship. On the other hand the fact that Mark lost his family when he was 2 years old made him be fully dependent on his older brother Dave. We can see the bond between them two being tested, when wealthy blue blood du Pont, decides to invite them both to his Foxcatcher a state, where he offers them a perfect training environment. However nothing comes free in this world and as the film progresses, the pressure on Mark to be the best and come out of his older brother shadow takes painful tool on his mental health. <br/><br/>The whole movie feels like a tour the force of those 3 actors. Both Ruffalo and Tatum went through 6 months long grueling wrestling training and indeed look the part. Both concentrated on body language and type of walk that truly transforms them on to this real life characters that seems to be removed from their actual film star persona. The biggest highlight however and to some extant surprise is the performance of comedian Steve Carell. His minimalistic performance is indeed Oscar worthy. Behind all the prosthetics, he actually developed a speech pattern and a way of breading which controls the speed of delivering lines. In ""Foxcatcher"" he is a super wealthy man who does not need to talk fast. Psychologically his relationship with his mother is interesting. He is looking for approval from her, always feeling like he disappoints her by engaging in a wrestling sport, which she feels is way too common for someone of his social statue. <br/><br/>On paper ""Foxcatcher"" looks like sure Oscar bet, however there is a problem in this movie and namely with the timing. Among many other things the job of a good director is to be able to maintain the timing of the lines between the characters which creates the illusion of reality. Big part of that, can be created in editing but sometimes when actors take a little bit too much time for their thought process in between their lines, the whole scene can loose it's tempo which happens here all the time. By doing so, when tempo of the movie gets slowed down the whole movie looses its intensity and audiences interest. That is a pity indeed because this film had a huge potential to be truly exceptional. I also think that music and specially sound design should have been used to a better effect. <br/><br/>I am happy for Steve Carell that he was able to showcase his dramatic side in this film. He has been rightfully nominated for an Oscar for his role. I only wish that the whole film would have been made a little bit better, raising it form a good level to a great one. It is all about fulfilling it's potential which ""Foxcatcher"" fully did not. I might be bit hard on ""Foxcatcher"" in this review, but when you've expected great things and you have to subtle, the enjoyment of the viewing experience can sometime leave something to be desired. ""Foxcatcher"" is still worth the cinema admission ticked though.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

","Recently I watched the Foxcatcher movie and it was so good movie for a true story. I enjoyed the story and the actors performance, First: Steve Carell did a great job, his character in the movie make me feel a little puzzled about whether if he is a good man or not. Second: Channing Tatum was amazing by playing the role of the Olympic wrestler who lived a hard life with his brother& coach Mark Ruffalo after their parent's divorcement. Mark Ruffulo also did a nice work in the role of the coach and the big brother who always want to be the supporter and the mentor of his brother.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the inspiration moments, we all need inspirations and positive pushes in the life, we can find that in Channing Tatum role as the Olympic wrestler and his ambitious& willingness to reach his dream station again despite all the barriers and fake parties around him who meant to exploit him in a negative way to fulfill their own needs.<br/><br/>Finally, in general the movie time covered the story, and the sequence of events was organized, the element of surprise also was available in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good movie who showed drama, action, and if you like watching true stories about how to don't give up your goals and how to learn from the previous people stories, this movie will be a good choice."
"jafar-iqbal","8","3","9","17 January 2015"," Two excellent performances highlight a great film
","Foxcatcher is your typical Oscar contender. It's based on an extraordinary true story. It has a bunch of very accomplished actors, many of whom are performing at the top of their game. It has that central performance which anchors the movie. And, crucially, it's quite fun to watch. Put it next to the other contenders that have just been announced, and this Bennett Miller film fits in very nicely.<br/><br/>The story is definitely extraordinary, and hard to believe that it happened less than thirty years ago. Mark and David Schultz, who both won gold medals in wrestling at the 1984 Olympics, were recruited by reclusive millionaire John DuPont to train the next generation of Olympic wrestlers at his purpose-built training centre. Known as Team Foxcatcher, it was an unlikely alliance with even unlikelier circumstances.<br/><br/>You don't need me to tell you how all of this ended – a quick Google search will do a much better job of that – but I can tell you that a very solid job was done of bringing it to the screen. Bennett Miller is a director with proved success in biopics – Capote and Moneyball are both brilliant – and he continues in that vein with this. He's very good at making sure he doesn't take too many creative liberties, letting the truth of the story take precedence.<br/><br/>But when you look back on Miller's past successes, what he does best is get excellent performances from the unlikeliest of actors and, with Foxcatcher, he gives that privilege to Steve Carell. Arguably one of the best comedy actors of the modern era, Carell was a massive gamble for this role, but he is fantastic. The prosthetic nose and hairpiece already help to strip away any preconceptions, but it is a performance so far removed from his previous work that you can't help but be impressed. DuPont was the richest man in America at the time, but he was also a loner. Living in the shadow of his mother (a small but significant and vicious cameo from Vanessa Redgrave), he saw Team Foxcatcher as his way of getting acceptance. The way he goes about trying to achieve that is funny (in a twisted way), but Carell plays it straight. There's no deliberate attempt to amuse, and neither does it happen accidentally. Every time he appears on screen, Carell makes you uncomfortable, especially as his power increases.<br/><br/>The other two points of this triangle casting are a mixed bag. On the one hand, we have Mark Ruffalo, who is the MVP. While Carell is the one getting all the media attention, it's Ruffalo who quietly steals the show with a very understated and emotional performance. He is the moral compass of the movie and, like so many great performers before him, he manages to express deep, complex emotions just by shrugging his shoulders or laughing nervously. He is definitely up there as one of the best character actors of this generation, and a joy to watch. Channing Tatum, I'm not as sure of. He is a good actor, don't get me wrong, and he isn't bad in this. In fact, he surprised me with the maturity of the performance. But, the truth is, he's a good actor but not a great one; and as Mark Schultz, who the film is following most, it needed somebody who could match Carell and Ruffalo. And he couldn't. I sat there and kept wondering how different the film would have been if it was Tom Hardy up there. Similar builds, similar intensity, but Hardy is far above Tatum when it comes to acting chops. But we got Tatum, and he holds his own, so fair enough.<br/><br/>What people do need to know is that Foxcatcher isn't a film about wrestling; there is, of course, some wrestling in it, but it's there as a narrative device. In fact, one of the best scenes of the film is a wrestling 'match' between the Schultz brothers. It's a five-minute scene where the older brother (Ruffalo) is training the younger one (Tatum), but there is clearly some tension. There are barely more than four or five words spoken, but we pretty much learn everything we need to know about the sibling relationship in that five minutes. Tremendous. At its core, Foxcatcher is about two things. The want and need for power; and the consequences of living in someone else's shadow. Foxcatcher has rightfully got some great press, primarily because of Steve Carell's performance, but I don't think it's quite there as an Oscar-winning movie. Of the three leads, Ruffalo is the one most deserving of an award (and he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor), but there are other actors more deserving. Still, this is a really engaging, dramatic thriller which does justice to an extraordinary true story."
"bschultz_the_pally","8","3","9","15 January 2015"," Grade: A-
","Foxcatcher is an interesting examination of human psychology and male dominance. With a cast of actors who are known for lending comedic talents far more often than anything else, it was easy to get buzz early on about the film, but would it pay off? <br/><br/>The movie begins with a very clear message; Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), an Olympic wrestling champion, has nothing. He has gotten to the top, and doesn't know what to do with himself anymore. On top of that, he is living in his brother's shadow (played by Mark Ruffalo). His brother actually has a life after the Olympics- he has a family to take care of, he is more social, and he owns a wrestling gym. Mark, on the other hand, only has wrestling. So when he gets a call from John du Pont, it's a chance for Mark to step into the spotlight again.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is the one to see in this movie; his role is transformative, both physically and psychologically. It is rare to see a character with so many different complexes- blind patriotism, mother issues, fame- and Steve Carell does it so well, almost all behaviorally. His facial expressions, despite being rather minimalist, speak volumes. He has his nose high in the air much of the film, and does impulsive, violent things. What's scary is that he seems in control at all times, though we go on to see that mentally, he is not in control, just fighting for it.<br/><br/>Even though he gives the best performance in the film, and his career-best, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo also give great performances. Channing Tatum, much like Steve Carell, relies more on physical acting than anything else. His character puts himself through a lot of pain to get to the top, and it clearly has an effect on him, but he doesn't want to vocalize it. He doesn't want to depend on anybody, but he falls for du Pont as soon as he gets the call, and the story begins to weave a dark web of dependency.<br/><br/>Enter Mark Ruffalo, Mark's brother, the established family man and wrestling champion, who begins to see what is happening to his brother Mark. He wants to look out for him, he wants to make sure his brother is taken care of, but he knows something is off with du Pont, and it might cost his family to save his brother. He tries to hang it all in the balance. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic in the role, and has transformed so much physically for the role. David Schultz is a man we can respect, and we fear for him, because he may be in a little bit over his head.<br/><br/>The movie relies so much on the strength of its performances that, sadly, it doesn't offer much else. The movie is so restrained, so much invested in the psychology of its players, that you'll be left remembering the characters, but walk away having learned nothing. Films don't need to teach a lesson or message, but there doesn't seem to be much communicated in the screenplay. It is simply a story of three men who want different things, and will do almost anything to get it.<br/><br/>The movie features a crisp look, but is pretty straightforward in its shooting. It fit the style, and the wrestling scenes in particular are intimately shot, paralleling the sport itself. The colors of the film are very overcast and grim, creating a darkly suffocating feeling. The editing of the film does its job, but considering the length of the movie, there are lots of little moments, and probably even some scenes, that could have been cut. At two hours and nine minutes, it feels overlong when there's little story pushing the movie in any particular direction. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher is well done in most aspects, and the acting is some of the strongest this year, but overall, the movie is slightly underwhelming itself. See it for the actors. See it for the characters. When you leave, that's all you remember about the movie. It's a good effort that needed just a little bit more focus."
"TheSquiss","8","3","9","15 January 2015"," Chilling tale with remarkable performance from an unrecognizable Steve Carell.
","Based on the true story of multi-millionaire John du Bont, part of what was once America's richest family, Foxcatcher is a dark brooding eight-star drama with three central ten-star performances.<br/><br/>Desperate to prove himself as a man of ability and power, John du Pont (Steve Carell) uses the family money to help an ignored Olympic wrestling champion, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), realize his potential without financial constraints. Du Pont establishes the Foxcatcher training facilities in the hope of ensuring Schultz, his brother, David (Mark Ruffalo), also an Olympic champion, and the American wrestling team strike gold again at the Seoul Olympics. But du Pont is not simply a magnanimous benefactor but a damaged, lonely and quietly violent man who is desperate to buy the love and approval of his condescending mother, Jean (Vanessa Redgrave), his wrestlers or any substitute he can pay off.<br/><br/>The obvious and overused comment is that Steve Carell is physically unrecognizable here. Many's the viewer who has sat through much (or all) of Foxcatcher, blissfully unaware that it is the star of simplistic comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin and Evan Almighty who is unnerving them from the big screen. But that has little to do with him; give those accolades to the make up department. What really matters is that Carell is unrecognizable because he gives one heck of a performance! Talk about chameleon-like ability! This is Carell as you could never have conceived him.<br/><br/>It would have been incredibly easy to portray du Pont as an outright monster, raging and throwing his weight around, but Carell owns the screen with a performance that is quietly chilling. There is a distinct lack of facial movement or expression, but the pauses, the silences In those eyes we see a man who is capable of great cruelty and damage in his quest for power and pseudo love.<br/><br/>Carell is the obvious star turn in Foxcatcher and the absolute about turn from his standard fare is nothing short of astounding, but both Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo are on fire here. With Ruffalo, it is solid support, gravitas and a powerful gentleness as the old brother looking out for his sibling as well as his family. Tatum is also something of a revelation as the wrestler of few words but much brooding. With a CV packed with the dreary, dumb and dire (White House Down, This is The End etc.) Tatum has a track record of convincing heartthrob beefcake, but at last he gives us a glimpse of the potential ahead.<br/><br/>But performances alone don't make a great film and Foxcatcher falls short of excellence due to director Bennett Miller's (Capote, Moneyball) apparent reluctance to commit. There is a great deal of ambiguity about Foxcatcher and that doesn't serve to intrigue but to frustrate. Du Pont's sexuality is implied but not made clear and there is suggestion of a sexual relationship and abuse, but Miller seems content to make vague references without ever committing.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Foxcatcher is a cold film. The aloofness and the suggestion of impending violence keeps us permanently on edge, and that is a great strength of the film, but there needs to be more to draw us inside du Pont's world. As it is, but for his final act, I was left wondering quite why Mark was so upset by du Pont's behavior. Yes he was a strange man, but strange doesn't explain Mark's reaction and emotional turmoil. We needed to see more actuality and not only implication.<br/><br/>A great film leaves the viewer wanting more. With Foxcatcher, Miller has given enough to intrigue but leaves us wanting enough to be satisfied.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","It's award season everyone! On the day I am writing this, the Golden Globes is set to descend upon us with the majestic two-hour red carpet special lying in wait along with my pot of coffee and sugar- filled lemonade. Cheers time zones. Of the films listed in the ""Best Films"" category, Foxcatcher, Selma, and The Theory of Everything, are the only ones I hadn't seen when the nominations were announced so I decided to catch up when they were released in UK cinemas, starting with Foxcatcher. Foxcatcher brings to life the true story of Jon Du Pont, played by Steve Carell, and his efforts in hiring the Olympic wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz, played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo respectively, to train under the ""Foxcatcher"" estate and ready a team for the 1988 Olympics. Although, from this short synopsis anyway, Foxcatcher seems to be primarily a sports film, the reality is that Foxcatcher is a different monster entirely. <br/><br/>When I first watched the trailer to Foxcatcher, I was astonished at the transformation of Carell, whose unrecognisable performance as Du Pont is undeniably the best feature of the film, with his character's eerie presence and ambiguous nature symbolising the tone I felt the film was trying to convey throughout its' two hour run- time. Both Carell and Tatum portray characters that are undeniably against type, and I felt this only enhanced the film's strengths, as it's dark and grim tone was unexpected, due in part to the fact that I had no previous knowledge of the events surrounding the story. <br/><br/>Another strength of the film is Ruffalo's performance, who, like Carell, is nominated for a Golden Globe, yet what stuck me most about the film was it's clear emphasis on the notion of family, with themes throughout focusing on brotherhood, paternal and maternal instincts, as well as feelings of isolation, particularly in relation to Du Pont, whose Gatsby-esque wealth and fame, brings with it a sense of loneliness and despair, helped only by his unusual love for his very own Daisy Buchanan, in the form of Mark Schultz. <br/><br/>Overall, Foxcatcher is a dark and twisted tale of one man's isolation which engaged me throughout. Its' grim nature and rather depressing feel may be too much for some, but in my opinion, Foxcatcher is a solid and surprising piece of cinema. Roll on the red carpet. <br/><br/>Overall Score: 8/10"

David has his respect and love for mark but mark has his tails up with the sudden entry of John played by Steve while Steve wants to impress his mother by doing something other than horse riding. This makes the movie interesting as Steve's mother unsympathetic towards Steve and the love chart flows back till Dave played by mark . The movie could have been more boring due to the topic it deals but due to the superb acting of Dave,the introvert acting of mark and John. 2 comedic actors coming to a darker scene and providing the audience with such opposite atmosphere is really praise worthy."

","""Foxcatcher""'s true story and ensemble both seem to have a cold and frosty shade of white over them and the film generally has that too, both literally and metaphorically. Bennett Miller's direction reflects this, and the several chilling shots he captures, for me made my experience within that screen. <br/><br/>The film's true story follows Mark Schulz as he trains to win the Gold medal for Wrestling at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, with the help of the multimillionaire John Du Pont. As usual difficult questions are posed and ""Foxcatcher"" again asks us a question, as so many films do, about America, and as Erin Whitney and Matthew Jacobs point out in their review for the Huffington Post, it is one that acts as ""a distant horror story for the 1% percent"". The film comments heavily on this with the multimillionaire Du Pont as the man at the fore front of these comments understandably. For example Du Pont almost seems to have the Olympic Wrestling Schulz brothers simply because they form part of his trophy cabinet, as objects to play with at his disposal, which acts as an explanation for the films ending. <br/><br/>But the compelling true story and character study, particularly in regards to John Du Pont (played by Steve Carrell), is the films strength and a fascinating one at that. It will probably be unknown to my generation. But as usual the story told here is different to the one that actually happened and on reading what did happen it seems that the film's director, Bennett Miller, missed out on several details that could have made the story that much better. For example, although the film does pick up on Du Pont's descent into madness to an extent, it doesn't take the opportunity to make it obvious and although I appreciate subtlety I think it would have been even better otherwise. In the true story, Du Pont for example thought that his horses were sending him messages from Mars and he also frequently asked his wrestlers to check his attic for ghosts. This really would have been a test for Carrell and could have contributed to an already stellar performance by him.<br/><br/>The film though is propelled forward by its performances that branch out past what these actors are typically known for, Channing Tatum (playing Mark Schulz) and Mark Ruffalo (playing Dave Schulz) for example. But it is Steve Carrell's performance that manages to break through the story and again what roles he is generally known for, and the hole that he leaves allows for Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo to follow through it, and therefore still deserved of the praise they have received from others. These performances ultimately stop ""Foxcatcher"" from being defined as good for its story alone. Bennett Miller's direction is good. As I mentioned several of the shots he captured really made my cinematic experience, the best of those featuring Du Pont releasing his horses out into the wild. We see Du Pont's dark silhouette with his hands raised, urging his horses to flee and it looked great on screen.<br/><br/>Although its story is good and its ensemble, headed up by Carrell, is brilliant ""Foxcatcher"" doesn't bring anything new to the table, and although I didn't expect it to, I did expect it to do more than it did. It's a vague expression to say that and I'm lost for words really in how to describe why I'm not rating the film better, but it's almost as if, thinking about it, the film was saved by its ensemble performances which will explain why so many will have it in their best films of 2015 lists come the end of the year. Ultimately, ""Foxcatcher"" is a good film and worth seeing, but not one that lives up to the hype surrounding it."

",""" . . . corrupts Freesylishly."" FOXCATCHER documents how wrestling ruined the lives of several people, renown Orinthologist, Conchologist, Philatelist, Museum Director, and Multimillionaire John Eleutere Du Pont foremost among them. Prior to being bit by the wrestling bug, Doctor (of Natural Sciences) Du Pont discovered 24 species of birds, authored several books about our feathered friends, and for fun purchased the world's most valuable stamp (the 1856 one-of-a-kind British Guiana, notably held by Audrey Hepburn in the film CHARADE). But concurrent with his descent into the underworld of big-time world wrestling, all of Du Pont's old friends and acquaintances noticed be was getting more and more erratic (if not paranoid). This movie is from the point of view of the surviving Olympic Gold Medalist wrestling brother, implying that John introduced HIM to alcohol and cocaine. (Anyone who's been around wrestlers will bet that it was ACTUALLY the other way around, but John's not alive to defend himself!) Wrestling compels this young man to trash hotel rooms, avoid women, as well as to engage in binge eating and regurgitation. Schools value his hang-dog presence as a motivational speaker at $20 a pop (about $9,980 less than Lance Armstrong or O.J. Simpson). In their wisdom, the International Olympic Committee banned wrestling from future Olympics after John's martyrdom, recognizing it for the perverse splinter religion it is. Yet it's allowed to continue corrupting and even killing American high schoolers today (one was found dead in his bed by his mom not far from me this morning). Worse yet, John never recovered from his wrestling disease, and was buried in his FOXCATCHER red singlet, in accordance with his will."

","Foxcatcher is a slow burn. In fact it's a really slow paced film, but at no point was I bored. That is because I think this film may be the single best acted film of the year. It's a shame that all 3 of the leads will likely be left out come Oscar night. Not only does Steve Carell give an uncharacteristically chilling performance, but Channing Tatum is an absolute revelation.<br/><br/>Without reading too much about this film and the stunning events that unravel, you can tell from the trailers that it's a pretty tragic tale. It's about two brothers who are world class wrestlers but are unable to make the next step to Olympic greatness without the resources needed. Here's where the ever-so-creepy John Du Pont comes in and gives them a home, wealth, and the training necessary to win gold. The question then becomes why does this man care so much about these kids to spend tremendous amounts of time and money. Well the answer is that this man is just crazy. Or just strange for that matter. Carell's voice makes the character that much more disturbing. Du Pont completely changes the way Mark Shultz (Tatum) looks at life. In a way he brainwashes all these kids to do things his way and only his way.<br/><br/>The most understated part of this film was Mark Ruffalo. Both the writing and his delivery of the subtle lines are just impeccable. His arc is both depressing and eye opening. A man this devoted and this engraved in his craft should never have to go through some of that stuff. With that being said I don't think anyone goes through more than Tatum's character. There is a particular scene where he is freaking out in his hotel room and pretty much hitting rock bottom. That's when I saw the once joke of an actor turn into an Academy Award level performer. You can see his dedication to this role in the pain he puts himself through in just that scene alone.<br/><br/>Sure, the film can be a really slow freight train at times but it's material gets more interesting as the film progresses. And the performances are just perfect all around.<br/><br/>+Tatum is a revelation <br/><br/>+Carell's transformation <br/><br/>+Ruffalo's understated performance <br/><br/>+Direction & writing <br/><br/>-Can be really slow at times <br/><br/>8.1/10"

This guy is just chilling, unsettling, disturbing and can't stand to watch sometimes. <br/><br/>The film Foxcatcher is Based on the true story of Mark and Dave Schultz - brothers and Olympic championship wrestlers, who found themselves involved with John du Pont - their sponsor and eccentric multimillionaire. This relationship would eventually lead down a path to murder.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher had a lot of hype not because of the director or the other actors like Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. The hype was for the comedy star Steve Carell has he takes a different performance from his usual comedy performance and how unnoticeable he is in this movie. There was a lot of Oscar Buzz about Carell performance for months after months about it and after seeing the film I can see why being are raving over this but I think it's a little bit to over hyped.<br/><br/>This movie may have stepped up Steve Carell career as not just a goofy comedy star but a serious actor as well, because in this movie his disturbingly and disgusting to the point were I forgot Steve Carell was playing this character.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo gives a great performance in this movie as he always do, because even when he's in a bad film he still gives it his all and in this he dose.<br/><br/>Probably the most over looked performance in this movie is actually Channing Tatum. I remember back in the day where Tatum was a bad actor and the movies that he was in you know these stupid comedy's that flopped at the box office, yeah those movies, but in this movie he gives a Oscar worthy performance that got so over looked that I'm actually shocked about. Tatum is good actor and I this he did brilliant. <br/><br/>Bennett Miller has proved himself to be a brilliant film maker when it comes to drama or Biographical films, and his previous films Capote, Moneyball and now this film totally shows his brilliant's in that. In this film Miller shows when the American dream of wining and being the best can turn Grey and really dark. He directed this movie with slick and passion and you really felt that in this movie.<br/><br/>The make-up in the movie was pretty well done. Now I don't normally bring up this in my reviews but in this movie every actor in this movie has make-up on, and it didn't look rubber like Cloud atlas make-up was.<br/><br/>For problems I have some like: The movie can be very slow at times now don't get me wrong I like slow paste movies because it's building up to something big, but in this movie they are scenes were it could have been cut out. The senses were you supposed to feel sad or shocked to kind of felt hollow for me.<br/><br/>Overall Foxcatcher is a good time first watch film and what I mean is the film is good but I don't want to watch it again. Why would I re-watch a film that make me feel disturbed deep inside, I'm sorry I just can't... still a good movie."

I made the mistake of falling for the hype of this boring movie. I wanted to see the entire cast. I really like all of them in other roles. BUT...they praise Steve Carell for his role in this monstrosity when really all he does is give long blank stares and mumble broken sentences. People have said the ending is shocking and unexpected. For me it was relief. It was over and I could focus my attention to my gorgeous girlfriend who had a look of ""What the hell was that?!"" on her beautiful face. We then went on to discuss how crappy it was and went to bed. Nothing really happens in Foxcatcher. There is a bit of a story about wrestling and the billionaire who was trying to live vicariously through all the wrestlers.

Later Dupont gets Mark's brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo) to join the team. <br/><br/>We see Steve Carell in a dramatic role as John DuPont. Carell is given a prosthetic nose for the role and most of the time he keeps his head high as if balancing the nose so it doesn't fall off. Why someone thought the prosthetic nose was needed is beyond my pay grade. Did the real John DuPont have this large a nose? Did the real John DuPont hold his head high? Apparently so. The nose is an issue in the sense that we couldn't help but notice it all the way through. My eyes never left the nose. Carell does a credible job and he should stick with drama as he was never funny as a comedian by my standards (you are tough).<br/><br/>This movie is very slow, the pacing borders on being creepy because we never know what is really going on between DuPont and Mark. Mark is introduced to drugs and booze, loses his edge in training and this is where DuPont gets brother Dave to join the team. Dave is also a former US Olympic Gold Medalist and seems to be a better leader of the team giving sound instruction all around. Mark feels slighted.<br/><br/>This is too slow bordering on being creepy mostly because the long silences between character dialogues by almost everyone. We thought there might be some homo-erotic play going on, but the movie never goes there and we are left with these uncomfortable silences. If the pacing was quicker this could have been a better story hence movie. This movie will be forever remembered by the slow pacing (hey,don't forget the nose) and not for the actors and what eventually happens. Not good. <br/><br/>We do get to see the DuPont estate and surrounding landscapes, at times, and these scenes are pure gold. It is here we didn't mind the slow pacing. <br/><br/>Steve Carell was nominated for Best Actor and Mark Ruffalo for Best Supporting Actor. The director was nominated for Best Director. . There was also a nomination for Best Writing – original screenplay. The dialogues were pretty good, but the silences over-powered them. (3/10<br/><br/>Violence: Yes.

I'm almost certain this is the first Steve Carell movie I've paid money to see, which begs the question, what the hell has he been doing all this time? Because he is brilliant here as the massively odd billionaire who just wants his mother to be proud of him, and he will do anything to gain her approval, even if he can't really actually achieve greatness due to his limited talent. The attention to detail given to each character is a shining example of how to add layers without the need of telling everyone's life story. And despite this undoubtedly being a touch too baggy of pace at a couple of instances, it's still richly constructed, expertly told, and at times hugely griping picture with steller performances from everyone involved."

Don't get me wrong, I watch tons of shows and movies in all different genres, but this was by far the worst, the most dull and dry movie I have seen in years. I think they could have done a much better job with this and I cannot believe it has been ranked so high! Even at times of celebration in this story there was very little emotion from the characters. I guess I had better not apply for a position as a movie critic as I must have it all wrong!

While the performances of the actors are all fantastic, I don't think this deserves some of the praising reviews I have read. Nothing really happens in this movie, apart from seeing many strong grown men training and accommodating the stupid and eccentric needs of a lonely and retarded millionaire. <br/><br/>By IMDb standards, a movie with a 7.4 rating is sort of OK to watch, and that's exactly what this is: just another movie"
"JamesHitchcock","8","2","6","11 February 2015"," I don't know much about wrestling. You don't have to in order to appreciate a movie as good as this one.
","I know very little about the sport of wrestling, and until I saw this film I had never heard of Dave Schultz, even though he is apparently regarded as one of the greatest figures in the history of the sport and was the victim in a sensational murder trial in 1996. Unlike some American true crime stories from the nineties, notably the O.J. Simpson affair, this one did not receive much publicity in Britain. Schultz's killer was his multimillionaire employer, John E. Du Pont, the heir to one of America's greatest family fortunes and the richest American ever tried for murder in the United States. Du Pont was a wrestling enthusiast who had formed his own wrestling team, based at Foxcatcher Farm, his country estate near Philadelphia, where American wrestlers trained for participation in the Olympics and World Championships. Schultz, who had won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics, was employed as a coach for what Du Pont called ""Team Foxcatcher"".<br/><br/>The film follows the changing relationships between Schultz, Du Pont and Schultz's younger brother Mark, himself an Olympic gold medallist and member of Team Foxcatcher. Mark was in fact the first of the brothers to be recruited by Du Pont; Dave was initially reluctant to join him but later relented. It does not state definitively what the motive was for Dave Schultz's murder, doubtless because no motive ever emerged in real life. (At his trial Du Pont was found to be insane). It does, however, examine the psychological relationships between those involved in these events.<br/><br/>As played by Steve Carell, Du Pont is a sad and lonely man, a poor little rich boy who has never really grown up. He is unmarried, and lives in a vast mansion with only his servants and his elderly mother Jean for company. Not that he and Jean really are much company for one another, as they neither like nor understand one another. She despises his passion for wrestling, which she regards as a ""low"" sport, and cannot understand why he does not enjoy more traditional aristocratic pursuits. He in turn has no interest in her great love, breeding horses. He is desperately in search of friendship, but finds it difficult to make friends.<br/><br/>Although nothing is ever made explicit, it is implied that Du Pont may have been homosexual. He initially becomes friends with Mark; the two men confide in one another, and Du Pont even introduces Mark to cocaine, which they take together regularly. Mark, however, abruptly breaks off their friendship and moves away from Foxcatcher, while Dave remains there. Again, his reasons for doing so are not made clear; they may have been connected with a decline in his form as a wrestler, but it is also possible that he was starting to resent the older man's over-familiar attentions to him. Unlike the unattached Mark, Dave is a happily married family man, and this may in some obscure way have aroused Du Pont's jealousy, either because he is sexually attracted to Dave or because Dave's home life represents something he wants but cannot obtain for himself. A key scene comes when Du Pont tries to visit Dave at his home one Sunday and Dave politely but firmly rebuffs him because Sunday is the day he always spends with his family.<br/><br/>Despite, or perhaps because of, its ambiguity about the motivation for some of the main characters' actions, ""Foxcatcher"" is a fine film. It gave me a chance to see something of the work of a director (Bennett Miller) who was previously unknown to me, an actor (Carell) who was almost so, and two others (Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo) whom I had only seen in a handful of films. All four make vital contributions to the success of the film, and Miller, Carell and Ruffalo have all been nominated for Oscars. (Oddly enough, the film itself has not been nominated for ""Best Picture""). Carell, who succeeds in making Du Pont pitiable despite his crime, gives a particularly good performance. Miller handles the action well and brings a melancholy, autumnal look to the film, appropriate to its tragic subject-matter. As I said, I don't know much about wrestling. You don't have to in order to appreciate a movie as good as this one. 8/10"

","The movie starts with Mark's training. We are introduced to his daily, living habits. We see his loneliness and isolation in his moderate house. Every clue directs me to think that the protagonist of the movie is Mark. And he actually is the protagonist for some time throughout the movie until the aberrant man shows up.<br/><br/>Mark is a quiet man. The thing that disturbs me most throughout the movie is Mark's way of expressing his feelings. He hurts himself, he punches his face, he never talks, even his brother or lets say even to himself, he doesn't look to the mirror. I had trouble understanding his feelings, his thoughts. Yes, it is based on a true story and there are many people who are almost mute and never with a poker face throughout their lives. Yet I was still eager to see more intense scenes (like the hotel room scene) about Schultz brotherhood. I would have gotten more satisfaction from a humane connection that Mark manages to build. <br/><br/>In general, I love the movie. The last scene was surprising but actually its coming was obvious. John du Pont's life is miserable in many aspects. Trying to prove himself to his mother, acting like ''coach'' of the wrestling team even if he is incapable of doing it, arranging the documentary based on lies and these behaviors are not the things any man would do. A very problematic and narcissist persona is hidden behind a calm man. <br/><br/>With successful performances of Steve Caroll, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum, Foxcatcher is must watch of 2014 and disheartening keeping in mind the ''based on a true story'' aspect of it."

"Troy_Campbell","8","2","6","1 February 2015"," A chilling look into a murky relationship.
","Bennett Miller's directorial career only consists of three feature films, yet his mark on Hollywood is already becoming indelible. His debut Capote saw Philip Seymour Hoffman garner a long-awaited Academy Award for his portrayal of the flamboyant artiste, then his follow-up Moneyball turned the sports flick on its head to deliver one of 2011's finest motion pictures. Now he's back with a dark and moody peek into the world of 1980's competitive wrestling, through the eyes of Olympic gold medal winner Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), his wrestling legend brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) and wealthy team sponsor John du Pont (Steve Carell). Much like Moneyball was a baseball movie that wasn't actually about baseball, however, Foxcatcher forgoes completely homing in on wrestling in favour of scrutinising the murky relationship between the bizarre du Pont and the tight-knit sporting brothers. It's a riveting and chilling, yet rather depressing story – made even more unsettling with the knowledge it's based on true events – that ends with an absolute gut-punch, but Miller's peculiar filmmaking style can be off-putting on occasion. Where the distinctive director masterfully excels once again though, is with the performances he generates from his cast. Looking, talking and moving differently to what we know, Tatum, Ruffalo and Carell expertly embody their individual roles to transcend the initial shock of their altered physical appearances, the latter two earning Oscar nominations in the process. If you're seeking fun at the cinemas then you might want to give this a miss, but if it's a (relatively) modern day Greek tragedy you are after, then Foxcatcher should be top of your list."
"Robert_duder","8","2","6","1 February 2015"," Fascinating but definitely slow burning
","I try not to use the same terms to describe films in my reviews but they are regularly used phrases for a reason. The first review I read on IMDb after watching this said a slow burning thriller to an explosive climax and that pretty much sums it up. I admit I had a lot of expectations for this. I thought this would blow me away given I really like Steve Carell and I wanted him to show off the chops I know he has. I even wanted Channing Tatum whom I'm not a huge fan of, to impress me and I thought this was the perfect vehicle. I don't have a ""but"" to follow this with. Foxcatcher is a very good movie. Its a very interesting story that I had never heard of before and it was the type of film that really makes you think and sticks with you after its over. Its an effective, real life thriller/drama with some good performances. But nothing about it in my opinion was particularly ""great."" Its a haunting story and the tension it builds is very good. The bizarre relationship between Mark and John du Pont is very disturbing but I couldn't help but wonder if du Pont was actually this far mentally disturbed. Would anyone have let this man go this far deep into eccentricity? Either way its a story worth seeing but many will find it very slow I am sure. It definitely builds at its own pace to a thunderous and disturbing climax that literally made me jump in my chair despite knowing it was coming.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is one of my favourite comedians and that's not an easy feat because I'm very particular about my comedy. But I also knew he had a lot more depth in him to perform. This certainly proves he can do drama. Obviously the physical transformation in the film is amazing but that isn't really a feat in itself other than for the make-up people. I don't know anything about du Pont so perhaps if I saw him and his mannerisms I would be more impressed with his performance. Carell's performance is subtle but definitely twisted at times. I'm not sure its deserving of an Oscar nomination but he still gives a good performance that you will be surprised by. Channing Tatum is also good as Olympic Wrestler Mark Schultz. Tatum gives a similar performance because its sort of subtle but there is something odd about him and his character. I'm not sure if Schultz was supposed to come across as not very bright but that's how he's portrayed. The dynamic between Tatum and Carell is incredibly strange and drives the film. Its such an odd story and relationship. Both are very good but short of great. Mark Ruffalo is decent but sort of underused and is just kind of there. He doesn't really do anything outstanding with his role but also doesn't make the climax any less shocking. Sienna Miller and Vanessa Redgrave are also quite underused in the film but their presence is significant enough.<br/><br/>I hated Moneyball...despised it. Director Bennett Miller got all kinds of acclaim for a film that was excruciatingly boring. I would love to have seen Foxcatcher in the hands of someone who could build a little more story to these characters. Still, Miller has redeemed himself in my book by creating something very dark and gritty and factual that you really have to keep watching. No matter how slow it feels from time to time you are completely compelled to keep watching. I'm a little disappointed after reading the real story of how du Pont was caught (he apparently holed himself up in his home for two days negotiating with police) that they ended the film the way they did. I understand that they had to for time sake but the story feels incomplete without knowing that piece of puzzle. Foxcatcher won't be for everyone because mainstream audiences will find it very slow but if you can appreciate it for depth and style and the characters then you will at least give it kudos. I don't think it holds a candle to other nominees this year at the Academy Awards but its worth seeing especially for those that love a true to life story or different style of thriller. 8/10"

","Is it the best movie of the year? No, I doubt it. I cannot give any credits to the director for his work neither. The duration of the movie is really long considering the story told.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to acting, wow ! Carell really nailed it ! After leaving ""The Office"", I always thought that he is uncomfortable with his reputation as an actor. He has been labeled as an one-dimensional comedian who plays exaggerated characters and he desperately felt an urge to get rid of this label. Finally, he has come up with a role like John E. Du Pont (a troubled mind doomed with antisocial character and a fortune) and nobody would ever name him a comedian. From now on, he is a real actor of multi-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>I do not want to end my review without commenting on Ruffalo's performance as well. If somebody would tell me that Mark was a professional wrestler before his acting career, I would definitely believe it. He had prepared himself perfectly for his character and become literally a real wrestler. After the movie, I have read an interview of Nancy Shultz (widow). She acclaimed that Ruffalo talks, walks and wrestles just like David Schultz. Well done, Mark !"
"gsygsy","8","2","6","1 February 2015"," Truly tragic
","FOXCATCHER slowly, inexorably, tightens its grip. I found myself becoming more and more tense watching it, which is a sign of how involved I was in Bennett Miller's telling of this melancholy tale of loneliness, delusion and betrayed trust.<br/><br/>The film is totally dependent on its three remarkable leading actors. In terms of public recognition, Channing Tatum's contribution seems to have been taken for granted, with no individual award nominations for him, as far as I'm aware. This is unfair. He matches the high standards of Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo: no mean achievement.<br/><br/>The exposition is a little ham-fisted, maybe. But apart from that, it's a well-written movie. Some, I know, have found the pace too slow, but I can't see any other way for its boa-constrictor effect to work, carefully coiling around you and gradually squeezing out all the air...<br/><br/>In retrospect, Bennett Miller's bloated biopic CAPOTE can be excused as a dry-run for FOXCATCHER. Both are about emotionally wrecked rich kids attracted by the virility and vitality of an equally damaged man from the other side of the tracks. CAPOTE attempts to raise its story to the level of tragedy but fails, because its central figure cannot reach beyond pathos. FOXCATCHER is a truly tragic tale. You emerge from it shaking your head at its inevitability."
"Turfseer","6","2","6","8 January 2015"," Not all of it rings true, but tale of creepy, demented heir, proves oddly fascinating
","In order for 'Foxcatcher' to work, it has to believable. How many liberties did the screenwriters take in depicting the sad seduction of brothers Mark and David Schultz, both Gold Medal winters in the 1984 Olympics, into the clutches of the troubled and deranged heir to the Du Pont family fortune and wrestling coach wannabe, John Du Pont?<br/><br/>The main liberties taken it would seem, were with the character of Mark Schultz. The films' scenarists would like us to believe that Schultz was sort of a mindless jock who perhaps didn't have the insight to realize he was getting involved with such a duplicitous and dangerous individual. According to the film, it was both Mark's naivety and insatiable need to be #1, that led him to be manipulated by Du Pont; but this is in part disputed by Schultz himself in his book, written after the tragic murder of his brother. <br/><br/>Before discussing this issue of Mark Schultz's naivety, one must acknowledge that 'Foxcatcher' gets it right in depicting him as being quite 'down and out' prior to being contacted by Du Pont. Both brothers were working as assistant coaches at Stanford but it was Mark who was fired and Dave who was kept; according to Slate Magazine, ""someone who feigned interest in managing his career,"" swindled him out of most of his money. Mark was living in a rented apartment in his father's house when Du Pont called.<br/><br/>According to Mark, unlike the way he was depicted in the film, he was deeply suspicious of Du Pont from the get-go. His main concern was that Du Pont had little wrestling knowledge and he ""cautiously"" arranged to meet Du Pont while he was training for the Worlds in Indiana. He saw Du Pont as a loser and didn't like the fact that his teeth were ""dark yellow and caked with food."" When Du Pont told him that he would be referred to as ""Coach,"" only in the media guide and that he would only pop in once in a while to check on how things were going, he didn't agree to talk right away but only after the trials were over.<br/><br/>Slate Magazine also points out that Mark didn't stay at Du Pont's estate when he first got there and actually looked at him as a ""loser""—someone who he had disdain and also pity for. So Mark's lack of skepticism early on in regards to Du Pont as depicted in the film, is not borne out by the facts. Nor was it particularly believable that none of the characters in the film (such as the other wrestlers who were training at the Foxcatcher facility) seemed to discuss what a creepy guy Du Pont was and that he might have some kind of mental illness. Indeed, while Du Pont was found competent to stand trial, he was ultimately convicted of Third Degree Murder but mentally ill.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of verisimilitude in regards to Mark's early encounters with Du Pont, the best part of the film chronicles Du Pont's bizarre behavior and underlying psychopathology. Donning a prosthetic nose, Steve Carrell, a comic by trade, transforms himself into a very creepy psychopath. Carrell watched a good deal of video footage to imitate Du Pont's mannerisms and those who had encounters with the real Du Pont indicate that Carrell successfully captures the essence of the demented heir.<br/><br/>Du Pont's obsession with guns is ably highlighted (and it was certainly true he often had the local police over for shooting practice), along with his passion for ornithology and philately. While wrapping himself in the mantle of ethical living and unbridled patriotism, Du Pont hypocritically used cocaine and insisted Mark Schultz try it too. The filmmakers argue that Du Pont's 'dementia' was rooted in his resentment toward his mother. Mark Schultz doesn't mention this in his book but the filmmakers speculate that Du Pont hated his mother's love for horses and that the mother looked at her son's obsession with wrestling as a ""low"" preoccupation. Du Pont's pettiness is correctly depicted by the film's scenarists when he rigs wrestling matches for seniors, and has his opponents intentionally throw the matches, so he can be declared the victor.<br/><br/>Recently Mark Schultz withdrew his support for the film's director over accusations that there was a homo-erotic component to his relationship with Du Pont. While not explicitly stated, one particular scene where Mark and Du Pont wrestle together in a suggestive way, might lead one to conclude that there was something going on between the two. But Schultz makes it clear in his book that he made it quite clear to Du Pont that he wasn't gay and had no desire to engage in any sexual encounters with him. <br/><br/>According to Slate Magazine, Mark's relationship with Du Pont fell apart after his brother Dave took over as coach. ""In reality, Dave never worked at Foxcatcher while Mark was there, and Mark was fired shortly after an angry confrontation with John over not much"" 'Foxcatcher' doesn't make it clear at all, but once Dave was hired as coach, he lived there with his family for 7 years.<br/><br/>As to the motive as to why Du Pont shot Dave Schultz, 'Foxcatcher' fails to go into Du Pont's interest in one Valentin Jordanov, a Bulgarian wrestler, who he ultimately gave 80% of his fortune to in his will. The day he shot Dave Schultz was Jordanov's birthday and perhaps he was trying to prove to Jordanov that Dave was no longer a rival and was out of their way.<br/><br/>Why did the Schultz brothers fall victim to Du Pont's seduction? Perhaps it was a puerile obsession with winning. Ultimately, just as big honchos of American wrestling were paid off by Du Pont, so the Schultz brothers also found themselves tempted by his greenbacks. Despite its flaws, the tale of the 'crazy as a loon' benefactor, proves oddly fascinating."

","""Foxcatcher"" isn't a sports movie. It's a movie about sports. Thi is the kind of film that gives you a knot in your stomach for the entire film even though nothing terrifying is coming until the end. The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont (Steve Carell) as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances. Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo play the brothers Mark and Dave Schukltz. They each give strong and intense performances. However, what makes this movie especially note-worthy is the shocking and legendary performance by Steve Carell. That's right, the hysterical Michael Scott plays a creepy and chilling wrestling coach worth billions. Carell's movements, eye contact, soft speech and makeup give him a charisma like Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the lambs."" He gives an absolutely jaw- dropping and career turning performance of a lifetime. Bennett Miller as the director shoots each scene with a kind of subtle intensity that really hasn't been done before. He films his characters' interactions perfectly to make us engrossed with each man. This male-dominated film tackles down the ideas of ambition and makes you wonder weeks after you view it. ""Foxcatcher"" is a poignant film that delivers both visually and mentally and will engross you in a way that few films can."
"leonblackwood","6","1","2","25 May 2015"," Intense drama with brilliant acting! 6/10
","Review: Although the acting in this film is superb, I did find it quite dull and really slow. The true story is about the wrestling Olympic gold medalist, the Schultz brothers who have a really close relationship until Mark Schultz gets taken in by a wealthy John du Pont who wants to mentor him through the Seoul Olympics. After convincing his brother, Dave Schultz, to come on board, he moves his family to the luxurious du Pont estate were the rest of the USA wrestling team are training. After certain events, Mark starts to distance himself from du Pont which causes friction in the once happy household. It also affects Marks performance in wrestling and John starts to breakdown after the lose of his mother. The storyline has enough drama to keep you glued to your seat and the fact that it is a true story, it does make it quite interesting but the tone and mood of the film made it quite depressing. The performances from Carrell, Ruffalo and Tatum were brilliant and I loved the chemistry between the brothers. The director chose not to delve into why John du Pont had such a weird state of mind so you have to come up with your own conclusion, why he done half of the things that he did. I know that he had a issues with pleasing his mum, who seemed disappointed with everything that he done, but he did have a touchy aura which put everyone on edge. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which gives an insight into the secret world of wrestling but for entertainment, I did find it quite boring it parts. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I really can't believe that this movie made a lose at the box office! For the performances alone, it should have made double the budget but the audiences must have found it a bit much to watch. It is full of intense drama and there are some emotional moments so you do have to be in the right mood to watch it. The director, who also made Moneyball and Capote, has only made 6 movies in his career so he's done quite good for his short time in directing. I did think that the film ended quite abruptly because you don't get to see how they done at the Olympics or what happened to them after they left du Ponts estate. Anyway, the main element which made this movie watchable was the acting. Apart from that, the storyline was interesting but it seemed to hit a brick wall after a while.<br/><br/>Budget: $24million Worldwide Gross: $16million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biopics about the famous Olympic gold medalist, the Schultz brothers and there relationship with the wealthy John du Pont. 6/10"
"ihatechoosingusernames05","6","1","2","8 March 2015"," Overall movie just okay
","I read the Hollywood vs real life and Mark S. comments prior to watching the movie. That may have made the movie a little less enjoyable. I am not a sports buff, I include that because I think my not knowing a lot about wrestling and the fact that I don't and will never understand why people take sports so seriously, may also be reasons why I didn't love this movie. <br/><br/>I guess the movie came from a book that Mark wrote or a lot if it did. I suppose that is why it focuses so heavy on MS. If I would have just watched this movie and not done any research I would have thought that JD killed DS because MS left and their relationship faltered. In truth it was DS and JD who were really close. I read that he killed him because HE was leaving. The movie portrays some type of jealousy coming from MS because of DS and JD's friendship. I don't believe that is accurate at all. Also I didn't get a homosexual vibe from the relationship between MS and JD as I read the former thought people might. What I got was a father son vibe from 2 weirdos who seemed to have trouble connecting with others. Yes WEIRDO would describe how MS and JD came off to me in this movie. Dave appeared to be the only normal one, although I knew he was going to get killed it was still hard to watch.<br/><br/>The individual acting performances were good. I love MR he was great. I didn't even bother looking up footage of that creep but it has been said SC played him quite well. I felt that he did a good job he is very talented. CT did a great job as a well. The movie overall it just left something to be desired. I am not a big fan of so called ""true"" stories because it seems the movies can't stick to enough of the truth and if fictionalizing the story makes it more interesting then stick to fiction. For example: MS never dyed his hair, so what was the point in adding it?"

","I walked into the theater wanting and expecting to like Foxcatcher. At first, the slow and stripped-down approach to each moment was interesting, but then I found out that the entire movie would be that. Lingering on the nothingness between events. About a quarter of the way through, I found myself more engaged by the fact that I had weird smelling burps from dinner. I don't know about you, but in my opinion, the journey of a depressed wrestler, a sociopath billionaire, drugs, depression, and obsession should be more interesting that a minor case of mouth farts. <br/><br/>Channing Tatum can act. He's been in enough B-movies and needed an acting role he deserved. So, he got cast in this movie. Channing didn't let me down in this department. He, Mark Ruffalo, and Steve Carell gave outstanding acting performances. I was impressed all the way through with how believable Channing Tatum was as an confused, emotional wreck. Mark Ruffalo made me feel for him just for being a nice guy. Steve Carell seriously delivered in his non-comedic role by being a skeevy bastard all the way through, even in harmless conversation. I was stunned by their performances, but that wasn't enough fuel to keep the movie engine going.<br/><br/>I'm not one of those guys who go into movies expecting everything to be going at light speed all the way through, though I prefer it. I understand that a movie might take time to show us things, but there's always a reason. The long sequence of the Dave re-entering the ship in Space Odyssey was to create tension. But Foxcatcher meanders and panders to people who think waiting through a slow movie is some kind of accomplishment. You didn't win a prize. You sat on your proud, waxed ass through a movie that didn't edify anyone.<br/><br/>The moments where I really was pulled in by what was happening were like needles in a stack of sentient hay that tries to smother the poor needles with its dragging artiness. These few great moments were just brief interruptions of the shots of du Pont's team running, training, sitting, and generally doing what they're meant to do: work. I once listened to a consultant at a paint store explain why she thought the colors in people's houses are important. It was interesting because it was her passion and she explained it with passion. Foxcatcher goes into excruciating detail about wrestling technique, but for all that it does, I still didn't care. This 134 minute jaunt across the pacific beaches of Planet Dull was uneventful and lead up to five minutes of climax. And what a climax it was. A great one. One that happened without warning or logic. It may be a true story, but that's no excuse. It's actually LESS of an excuse. John du Pont was a real guy. Surely someone looked into his motivations at some point. Out of those 134 minutes, I'm going to liberally guess that I enjoyed 20. That's 26.8% good. That's 73.2% drab void-space. That's too damn much boring. That's a failure of storytelling.<br/><br/>The movie's tortuously slow progression to a dissatisfying ending expects the audience to enthusiastically bury their faces into its cleavage.

","This movie is based on a mostly true story of John Dupont's strange involvement in wrestling. What it doesn't cover is that Dupont earned a PhD from Villanova in 1973 and in his 30s and 40s did some valuable scientific work in his field of natural science. Also not covered was his marriage at age 45, lasting only a few months, and in divorce hearings she accused him of pointing a gun at her and tried to push her into a fireplace.<br/><br/>So this movie depicting him as a bright but socially inept man who only had one friend as a child, later finding out his mother paid the boy to be his friend, seems pretty close to the mark. <br/><br/>This movie focuses on the late 1980s when he got Olympic champion brothers Dave and Mark Schultz to come to his wrestling training facility he built at his Foxcatcher residence. Dupont is depicted as a man who bought his involvement in championship wrestling. He seemed to need to impress his elderly mother even though he was already in his 50s. He put on a show, pretending he was the coach, when in fact Dave Schultz was coaching the team. <br/><br/>A really good movie of a very flawed man and his sad ending to what could have been a very nice life. Almost unrecognizable was Steve Carell as John du Pont, plus Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz and Mark Ruffalo, himself a wrestler in high school, as older brother David Schultz. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Just in case anyone is not aware, in 1996 when Dave Schultz and his family were still living on the Dupont property, Dupont drove up, Dave greeted him, Dupont asked ""Do you have a problem with me?"", fired several times with a handgun, Dave Schultz died of the wounds, Dupont was convicted and sent to prison where he died in 2010 at the age of 72."

He wants nothing more than to my the coach of an Olympic gold medalist and thinks he finds the perfect candidate in Mark Schultz (Tatum). What starts off as a perfect paring begins to strain when Mark's brother joins the team. There is no way to talk about this movie without talking first about the performance by Steve Carell. He is known primarily as a comic actor so he was an interesting choice to play someone as off kilter as du Pont. The fact that it was him though made the character that much creepier. The make-up is so good that it is easy for you not to think of Carell in the role and it adds to the impact of the movie. The way he plays du Pont is so unsettling. Prolonged stares and pauses really make you feel uncomfortable for almost the entire movie, and that is a good thing. I remember when the actual events happened but that did not detract from the enjoyment of the movie at all. I also have to admit that Channing Tatum did a fantastic job in this and I really think it should have been him rather then Ruffalo who should have been nominated for this movie. The movie is very creepy and very well done but not as good as I was hoping for. Overall, a very good movie with great acting, the only downside is that is seems to slow down a little toward the end. That said I do still highly recommend this movie if for no other reason than to watch Steve Carrell. I give it a B+."

","It seems to me that director Bennett Miller got it all wrong with this one. There's an interesting story to be told here but instead he focuses far too much time on unimportant and frankly boring aspects of the story. I have read that the real John Du Pont was capable of far more outlandish behaviour than simply the murder he committed and yet, because I suspect Miller wanted the murder to come out of the blue and be a complete surprise, we see almost none of this. The audience is made to miss out so that the director can have his ""shocking"" twist come to light. Furthermore, all of this is based on a true story so anyone who took a couple of minutes to look into what the film was about before going in is going to know what to expect anyway. And yet he has been nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards (without the film even being nominated for Best Picture I might add). Lord help me.<br/><br/>Both Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo have also been nominated for Academy Awards for acting in a Lead Role and Supporting Role respectively. Neither did a lot to earn their nomination either I must say. I suspect Carell has simply achieved his based on his ""transformation"" that we all know the Academy love so much. No one could deny he looked and acted very differently to the comedic genius we all usually are treated to, but does that make the performance great? His face stole scenes but his acting certainly didn't. I would be very surprised to hear his name read out as the winner, in fact let's write it off completely - it won't happen.<br/><br/>Ruffalo was better than Carell in that he really had no visual aids, but simply acted his socks off. The poorly written script really didn't give him a lot to work with but he did his absolute best with what he was given. His chances of winning are probably dented more so by the film itself than anything. If J.K. Simmons wasn't such an absolute lock though I think he may have been in with a chance.<br/><br/>The film had real potential, but sadly the director and screenwriters were so intent on making sure this wasn't an entertaining thriller (that may have hurt its search for awards you see) that they managed to kill the watchability factor almost altogether. For a movie absolutely drowned in dialogue, none of it is in the least bit inspiring or memorable. Every character seems about as depressed as a human can possibly be in every single scene from start to finish. No scenes, apart from the murder scene and perhaps the mirror smashing scene, have any oomph or kick to them at all. All this equals a very tedious watch with minimal payoff. Very disappointing."

Steve Carell is so creepy in this but I found him a little distracting, I thought how could anyone be that strange..but upon looking up footage of the real John Du Pont I stand corrected, Carells performance captures Du Pont 's stilted speech very well, The difference in some mannerisms, the real Du Pont had a creepy grin as he spoke while Carell played him much more intense. Channing Tatum impressed me more than Carell, I've never been a fan of Tatum but his intense portrayal of a man trying to escape his brothers shadow is understated and subtle making his occasional emotional bursts of frustration all the more impressive. Mark Ruffalo is the heart of the film in a warm charismatic performance that is entirely believable. Many fault the glacially slow pacing and over abundance of wrestling scenes but I was engrossed as previously stated I had no idea what was going to unfold. Overall this is a dark uncomfortable to watch tale that I appreciated but its not a film I would want to sit through again anytime soon."

","This may have been the most bleak movie I've ever seen! *Possible spoilers if you don't know the real-life story*<br/><br/>Foxcatcher tells the true life story of wrestlers Mark and David Schultz and their lives with John Du Pont in the mid-to-late 80's. Du Pont, an extremely rich and powerful oddball, recruits the promising young Mark to his Team Foxcatcher. The two form a very uncomfortable father/son relationship, but more accurately, a pimp/prostitute relationship. Du Pont keeps Mark under his thumb with alternating displays of affection and detestation, money, shelter, and even hard drugs, while Mark wants nothing but to please his benefactor. This dynamic is interrupted at the arrival of David, Mark's brother, whom Mark also looks to as a quasi-father figure. David's presence brings out anger and jealousy in Du Pont, as the man can literally have anything (even a military tank with a mounted machine gun), but he'll never have the kind of love that Mark and David share. I found the bizarre love triangle of Foxcatcher to be really intriguing, but Bennett Miller's screen adaptation of this real life story suffers from a lack of artistic flair. Everything about the characters, setting, timeline, etc, comes off as completely accurate to the actual account, but the film is both glacially paced and dry as a bone. By now, I'm used to watching slow art-house movies, but Foxcatcher takes things to a new level. Nothing particularly stimulating happens throughout, at least nothing apart from the typical troubled-athlete peculiarities (Mark punching himself in the face repeatedly and wrecking up a hotel room). It's just scene after scene of Du Pont speaking vaguely about patriotism and victory and Mark going along for the ride, which is interesting at first but grows more tedious as the film progresses. This repetition was surely the intention of the screenwriters, but the effect of it is numbing to the viewer. <br/><br/>Like the screenplay, the visual style is technically proficient (grim, dark cinematography that perfectly reflects the stark nature of the material) but is void of any passion. Even the simple piano/violin score was too sparse for its own good, conjuring up very little emotion. <br/><br/>Perhaps I'm harping on the negatives because of the huge critical hype following Foxcatcher, but one thing I'm sure of is that the acting is some of the best I've seen all year. Steve Carell gives the best and most memorable performance of his entire career as John Du Pont. Carell nailed every aspect of the character, from his off-putting facial expressions to his awkward, halting speech patterns. Du Pont is possibly the most unnerving character I've ever seen portrayed in a film, and Carell deserves every bit of praise coming his direction. Channing Tatum, an actor I was never quite sure of, was practically tailor-suited for the role of Mark. Tatum doesn't have a great deal of finesse, but he was clearly dedicated to the production and pulled off the 'coming apart' scenes very well. Mark Ruffalo, another actor I've never been crazy about, is brilliant as David, who's actually my favorite character of the film. His intimate interactions with Tatum are highly realistic, as is the chemistry with his wife and children. David seems to be the only character with a steady head on his shoulders, making the end of Foxcatcher all the more bleak.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is a film I'd have a hard time recommending to people. I didn't really enjoy watching it and I felt severely depressed after it was over. Of course, that doesn't make it bad by any means. It's simply a realistically told, dour story that wallows a bit too much in its own discomfort. I do think the enormous critical praise is excessive, but there are features of it, particularly the acting, that are definitely Oscar-worthy."

","When you have a movie based on a true story, where the producer is one of the characters in said movie (in this case, Mark Schultz) then one must be cognizant of fact that the contents of the film may be skewed in a way so as to not upset the producer's credibility. That said, with the help of some momentarily interesting (but highly flawed) filmmaking from director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) ""Foxcatcher"" does go places that I didn't think it would go; to the tune of some very obvious sequences of homoerotic innuendo.<br/><br/>Synopsis: This is the story of Olympic gold medalist, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) a man who constantly lived in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo). In the mid 80's, Mark gets a call from a representative of John du Pont (Steve Carell) an unstable but extremely wealthy man; who touts himself as a bird watcher, patriot and leader of men. Du Pont initially recruits Mark to head up his wrestling team he has prestigiously dubbed Team Foxcatcher. But as du Pont takes Mark under his wing, he forces himself into the role of father figure (a role previously held by David) and then some weird stuff happens, resulting in sequences where Channing Tatum is doing drugs and sporting frosted tips. OK, so while this is a watchable character study, it's not much more than that. Even with its ending, which is highly eventful but so jarring that, for some, it may seem to come out of nowhere, ""Foxcatcher"" meanders around for a majority of its 134 minute runtime, likely losing most of its audiences along the way.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with ""Foxcatcher"" is most definitely the pacing. Olympic wrestling is an odd sport to watch on film if you don't know what is specifically going on. Before going into ""Foxcatcher"" I'd questioned how Miller was going to film events pertaining to the sport itself in a way that would come across as entertaining to all audiences. But then again, some critics used to think the same about filming boxing, since (aside from momentary flurries) boxing would seem like a fairly uneventful sport to film. But since the 70's with movies like ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"", it has become obvious that boxing can be shot in a way that is highly theatrical. As for ""Foxcatcher"", Miller seems unable to solve the problem of translating Olympic wrestling into something theatrically entertaining. Thus, every wrestling match shown hangs there, lifeless, especially if you have no clue how matches are scored or how one wins and loses. This flaw is clearly on Miller and his bland technique of filming these sequences. Also, it doesn't help that about 1/3 of this movie is wrestling matches and training sessions, which I suspect will put some to sleep. The second part of this pacing problem lies with the decision not to add a musical score. Yes, at times, near the end, there is a score. But most of this film is filled with silence and the sound of wrestling shoes on mats. Now, I can see what Miller was going for (with a lack of music brings on feelings of solitude, which represent how Mark Schultz is feeling during most of this movie). But this experiment comes across as awkward at best.<br/><br/>The acting is one of this film's only ""bright spots"", so let's focus on that for a moment. Tatum and Ruffalo do some of their best dramatic work here, as visually they become these characters; down to the wrestler mannerisms; the way they carry themselves and simply walk around. As for Carell, his performance will be the one everybody focuses on, since he plays a character so far removed from the slap-stick realm, with more prosthetics on than a Lord of the Rings character. And while he does do an excellent job portraying du Pont, would I say, give him the Oscar right now? No. Maybe the most complimentary thing I could say about his performance was that at many times I forgot it was Carell under all of the makeup; which may predictably be the reason he wins the Oscar this awards season.<br/><br/>Final Thought: As wrestling is more of a psychological sport than a physical one (even though it may appear otherwise) so is this movie. That is to say, though there is not a lot of action, there is clear and continuous psychological conflict between the three main characters within ""Foxcatcher"", which is an interesting take away. This and the acting are things which will garner this film attention from the award givers. But as a whole, does this film resemble anything entertaining or memorable? The answer is, absolutely not."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The 1996 newscast remains vivid in my mind. It was captivating due to the bizarre circumstances and the tragedy involving an athlete whose Olympic career I had followed closely. Initially, I had trouble reconciling the story of this popular world class athlete and the mentally troubled billionaire who was part of one of America's richest and most iconic families. This movie fills in some of the gaps.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller (Capote, Moneyball) is a meticulous filmmaker and is never in a hurry as a story teller. He allows the characters to develop on screen at their own pace ... and this time the pace is excruciatingly slow - in a brilliant, yet painful to watch manner. The lead characters are a diverse trio of men. Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) won Olympic Gold in 1984, but he is shy and withdrawn to the point of being socially awkward and unable to capitalize on his victory. His older brother Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) also won a Gold Medal in 1984, and is very engaging family man who helped raise Mark, while building endorsements and job opportunities for himself. The triumvirate is completed by the incredibly odd billionaire John DuPont (Steve Carell), who proclaims himself a wrestling coach after building a state of the art training facility on his family estate. The ultra rich can do such things.<br/><br/>John DuPont was never able to live up to his mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) standards. She even paid the chauffeur's son to be John's friend as they were growing up. With Mark always in the shadow of his more popular brother, DuPont seizes the opportunity to capitalize on Mark's vulnerability and invite him to lead his Foxcatcher wrestling team (named after the estate which is near Valley Forge). DuPont's ultimate goal is to also have Dave join them, but it's a tougher sell for various reasons.<br/><br/>The mommy issues and brother issues drive the need for validation and are at the core of story here, as are ego, ""patriotism"", and ultimately delusion. Steve Carell sports a nose apparatus that captures the reason DuPont nicknamed himself the ""eagle"". He also kicks his head back, while slumping his shoulders, in physically capturing DuPont's unorthodox movements. But that's nothing compared to the eerie aura he puts off whenever he must deal with another person. He sends up red flags to anyone even minimally aware of their surroundings, but to a lost soul like Mark, he becomes a father figure and ""coach"".<br/><br/>A wrestling movie would figure to be male dominated, but even with that, Sienna Miller (as Dave's wife) and Vanessa Redgrave (as Jean DuPont) are almost non-existent as the only female characters. Anthony Michael Hall has a brief supporting role, and it's nice to see Guy Boyd back on screen as well. However, most every scene is some mixture of Carell, Tatum and Ruffalo, and they each deliver. It's a side of Carell we have never before seen (many of the greatest comics have a dark side), and Tatum is spot on as the hulking, sulking Mark, while Ruffalo captures the easy charm and sensitivity of Dave.<br/><br/>The story offers further proof that life can be stranger than fiction ... especially when it involves an insecure and mentally unstable billionaire who envisions himself as a leader of men."

Or the lack of it.<br/><br/>The movie is also based on a true story, yet the actors who portrays the real characters, are doing a very poor job. As an example; The actor who plays Dave, resembles nothing how he was in real life: Funny, full of energy, witty, always cheerful. The only similarity they have, is that he has a beard and is balding. The Same goes for the actor who plays John Du Pont; John Du Pont were never this slow or psycho as he is portrayed in the movie.

","I have a book called ""Flesh and Fantasy"" which explains how to win or be nominated for an Oscar. One way is a false nose.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell (with a false nose) stars as John Dupont in ""Foxcatcher"" from 2014, also starring Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>""Foxcatcher"" is the story of two brothers, 1984 Olympic Gold medalist in Wrestling, Mark Schultz (Tatum) and his brother Dave. Mark is invited by the fabulously wealthy John Dupont to train at Foxcatcher Farms and form a team, with the goal of winning the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Schultz agrees and is excited for a chance to do something on his own, away from his well-known brother Dave (Ruffalo).<br/><br/>Dupont feels that he does not have the respect of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and wants the wrestling team to help him gain not only her respect but to boost his ego. Mark becomes increasingly more dependent on his approval.<br/><br/>However, all that glitters -- Mark finds himself involved in things that could wreck his training, both physical and psychological. Dupont then has Dave come in as a trainer. The end of the story is tragedy.<br/><br/>Well, the whole thing was a tragedy. It was so dull, it was practically done as a documentary - and not a particularly interesting one, I might add. The pacing was sleep-inducing. <br/><br/>I blame the director for absolutely everything that went wrong. Steve Carrell probably studied DuPont and gave an accurate portrayal. Given Dupont's psychological problems and lack of self-esteem, Carrell's flat affect, both in his lack of expression and flatlined voice, were correct.<br/><br/>The only problem with that is, it's hard to recognize how deeply disturbed he was when everyone around him is acting the same way. Channing Tatum spent the whole film looking like a dumb jock and muttering. The homoerotic part of their relationship is shown, but since Tatum acted no differently than he did in the beginning, it's hard to say if it bothered him or not. He does, however, frost his hair.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo does the best he can.<br/><br/>Obviously from the reviews, people read into it a lot more than was there, and that's good. If everyone had the same opinion, it would be a pretty dull world - almost as dull as this movie."

Mark gets attention and adoration from du Pont, but soon his limelight is robbed by his older brother. There are ups and downs, but I find the ups and downs not engaging enough. The road to Olympic glory could be inspiring and touching, but I guess this is not the focus of this film, therefore this journey to Olympic glory is very understated in ""Foxcatcher"".<br/><br/>The many subplots are not adequately explained, such as the appearance of military vehicles and firearms; and more importantly the homo-erotic undertones of du Pont's wrestling training.

After watching this movie I can't understand what wrestling is about as a sport.<br/><br/>They did a terrific job transforming the actors. Steve Carrell with the prosthetic nose and make up looks and behaves unrecognizably. He gives off a wacko vibe that is chilling. He doesn't have a lot of dialog or change of facial expression but what he does is convincing. Channing Tatum with some Neanderthal prosthetics in the nose and mouth does the primate walk quite well.

I wrestled for several years and would know if they wrestling sequences were crap--they weren't and I appreciate the shape the actors got in to do the film.<br/><br/>Now, what I didn't like. I have rarely seen a film more bereft of energy than this one. Heck, compared to this an Ingmar Bergman film looks like a Disney picture!! Stark music, stark cinematography and actors who are practically mute make this a very hard film to energize the audience. Plus, often events in the film seemed incomplete--as if you were supposed to know exactly what happened to Mark Schultz in the 1988 Olympics or what motivated Du Pont to commit murder. Instead, it's all a very bland cipher. Additionally, the historical accuracy of the film and timeline are often wrong and could have been better.<br/><br/>Overall, a huge disappointment--much of which is because of all the hoopla about the film but also because it was so lifeless and dull and didn't need to be."

Channing Tatum hasn't completely convinced me that he's not just a flash in the pan, but he went a long way to earning my respect as the block-headed wrestler who wants to get out of the shadow of his brother and falls for DuPont's spell. And Mark Ruffalo brings his scruffy naturalness to the role of Channing's older brother, the biggest victim of the film and the only thing that comes close to giving this twisted and sordid tale something warm and normal to anchor it.

Such a story has probably being played out many a time in sports across the world (Iraq football team springs to mind).

As billionaire John du Pont (of the famous du Ponts) he stands in the front room of his family's 800-acre estate on an overcast day and stares blankly out the window. The cogs in John's brain are ticking away although we are never privy to what he's actually thinking. All we're sure of is that something wicked this way comes.<br/><br/>Carrell is a revelation in Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher, a problematic drama that doesn't succeed as a movie but none-the-less succeeds at giving us a great dramatic performance by a man who has always been one of our most dependable comedians. Here taking a dead serious turn, he plays a man wading hip-deep in his own self-doubt, whose need to rise above the crippling disappointments wrought on him by her stern mother led to him down a path of self-destruction.<br/><br/>Foxcatcher is based on a true story that, I'll admit, I hadn't heard. Du Pont's madness stemmed from a crushing insecurity and a seething ambition to prove himself despite a lack of any real talent. Straining to use his deep pockets to put something important in motion, he set up a training facility at his family's estate where he could coach the U.S. Olympic wrestling team for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, never mind the fact that he had no experience whatsoever.<br/><br/>His first task is to reach out for the services of Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who recently won a gold medal at the Olympics in Los Angeles. Mark is also a man swimming in loneliness, living a solitary existence, he seems to have no friends outside of his older brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo) with whom he shares the Olympic Gold. The two not only grew up together, but raised one another after their parents died. Yet, while Mark leads a quiet, lonely life, Dave is happy with a wife and two beautiful children. When du Pont offers Mark and Dave a position on the team, Mark jumps at the chance but David is reluctant.<br/><br/>What follows is a bizarre journey of seduction and manipulation that eventually leads to tragedy. Du Pont is a man who lives by, and for, the belief that his money can buy anything. When he's told that he can't have something, we sense his blood boiling. He doesn't turn to rage but to snaky manipulative measures designed to get his way. He finds that one brother is easy to get to, but the other not so much.<br/><br/>All of this works well at the outside. The performances by the three leads are great, and there's an effective supporting role for Vanessa Redgrave as John's disapproving mother. But the movie itself just doesn't work. It's extremely dry dramatically, and much of the movie is made up of long, slow passages in which nothing is happening and nothing is being said. The silence works well at establishing mood but after a while it just becomes kind of a yawn.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller who has previously made Capote and Moneyball, both wonderful movies about men seething with ambition, here seems to drown his movie in atmosphere. Some of it works, but most of the time you want to get out of the slow pace and get to the meat of the story. There is a great deal in this story that is not being said, and we are asked to fill in the gaps. That's fine, except that this approach leaves us at a distance when we should be getting some sort of insight, or at least a foothold.<br/><br/>Despite its problems, you're still left with that brilliant performance by Steve Carrell. He plays du Pont as a man who bathes in his own sense of pathological entitlement. It's not just a comedian trying to play serious. He works at this character. You only with the movie were as effective."

","In Foxcatcher Channing Tatum plays real life Olympic gold medal winning wrestler, Mark Schultz. In the early 80's, Mark is hired by Billionaire John Du Ponte (Steve Carrell) to train him and a team of Olympic hopefuls for the upcoming summer games. John's ulterior motive is to hire on Mark to eventually convince his brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo), a better wrestler, to join their wresting organization and coach. Mark is lured in to the eccentric world of money, drugs once under John's wing. After John is able to buy David into joining the team; Mark then begins to fall apart and the real life events of this odd bit of history play out for our viewing horror. I think I was either too young or just not interested enough in news a young kid to remember this story. Of course a lot of the story was amped up for the sake of a good narrative but the major events are true. I will not spoil the ending for others of you who do not remember the outcome. A lot of time is spent in this film with tedious character development. My hat is off to Channing Tatum for branching out on more challenging roles, this is a much deeper departure from Magic Mike 2. Although he is still a big frat guy; he just plays a bigger, dumber frat guy with a prosthetic nose and cauliflower ear. There is one big climactic scene toward the end where he shows some promise. I love how filmmakers always seem to visually represent a cocaine addiction spiraling out of control with a douchey haircut. I wonder how that creative process goes. ""Okay, cocaine addiction is spiraling out of control at this point, besides dark circles under the eyes how can we get our point across?"" ""Douchey, haircut?"" ""Yes, yes spike the hair and frost the tips, DONE!"" Steve Carrell's performance is very complex and should gain Oscar recognition. He has obviously done some working on nailing the John du Ponte look and mannerisms. Although from the footage I have seen of the real John du Ponte , Carrell is playing him a little more ridged than the actual person; kind of Frankenstein-esq. Perhaps as a means of really selling the sinister nature of the character. Sienna Miller plays David's wife Nancy. This is the second Bio-pic this year for Sienna who played Chris Kyle's wife Taya in American Sniper (2014). The overall message of this film is that we all are seeking someone's approval in life, be it a mother, father, brother, friend or employer. This movie is a very slow burn and requires some patience. If you were aware of the story, then this will be a very interesting watch. Even after seeing the film having not known, it's interesting to go back and see the actual people and real life story. Aside from seeing Steve Carrell outside of his comfort zone and pushing hard on a new dramatic character (that's what she said), this movie offers little until the end in the strait entertainment department. Artfully done, just not one you need to see more than once."

","I want to start off by saying that I don't think the descriptions of this being too ""cold"" or ""detached"" are warranted at all. I mean, for a story like this, how else did people expect it to be told? Bennett Miller's directing is fine, could be really predictable in some scenes and the way the music soars over them, but could be really inspired and precise as well. It's the screenplay and the psychological dilemma between these three lead characters that drive the film and make it incredibly compelling. All three main performances are fantastic. Carrell's could've felt like a complete gimmick, but he makes it work to unbelievably, but quietly, intense heights. Ruffalo provides the effortless naturalism that he's so great at, and Tatum works in ways I would've never expected. It's a very understated performance, and whether everything he did was thought out or just came off that way, it was truly great work from him. Very intriguing film overall, but definitely sort of difficult to truly and deeply love."

","The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher is directed by Oscar nominated Bennett Miller, stars Steve Carell also nominated for best actor in a leading role, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo. In fact Steve Carell performance is very good, he's properly unrecognisable. At this point, his performance is clearly career defining. Plus in my opinion Channing Tatum is largely underestimated. He gives a performance that is so restrained and in which you can read so much on his face, some moments you can literally feel his pain and torment. Mark Ruffalo plays a father who is very protective of his family but also of his brother and he also deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor in a supporting role. In fact, all those three performances are Oscar worthy to me or at least nomination worthy as the movie cannot function without them. However it is a quite slow paced movie, there are few 5 to 10 minutes long sequences and you are left wondering what was the real purpose of those scenes. This movie is based on a true story and tries to make a statement on why Dupont did what he did. The emotional core of the movie is very hollow and distant. As I said before I think Channing Tatum is the lead actor in this film; some of you can disagree and think that it is Steve Carell, but Tatum's character is the only one I really felt connected with. Finally, if you combined the slow pace, the blank emotional core and the fact that you can't really understand some of the character motivation behind this film it's a little bit disappointing. <br/><br/>Overall Foxcatcher is a beautifully shot movie with some out of this world performances but the heart and soul of the film itself is a little bit distasteful."

A Hollywood film would likely have ended with the Olympic glory with the final victory in slow motion (including the audience jumping to its feet) with a blaring orchestra. Instead, ""Foxcathcher"" shows a very deglamourized life (especially Mark's) post-Olympics, bravely showing the flip-side of the Olympic dream.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller uses a story-telling style that is deliberately bleak and emotionally distant. This mood is best shown in Carell's performance which is subtle and repressed as he portrays someone who, most of his life, was given too much money and not enough love. The only warmth in the film comes from Ruffalo whose character has found happiness with his young family.<br/><br/>The bleak style is fine but up to a point as the movie feels too long a 2.25 hours. Also, despite the length, there still seems to too little background of some characters. It's still praiseworthy, though, for its unique approach to sports biographies."

Wonderful acting, some great dialogue. Understated performances is an understatement here (with notable exceptions). I was not really captivated by the wrestling scenes, but this could be my lack of interest in them rather than the film itself. It's all atmosphere, character development, and performance, with some fine direction. But where is the story? I also found fault with what I assume is the editing. There are parts of the film that seem be skipped, where I was sure a scene was missed - or parts that were so briefly shown it was nearly impossible to observe what was important, but this could be a fault of direction or camera- work.<br/><br/>I am still wondering why most of the events in the film happened.

"BobbyT24","5","0","1","8 December 2015"," A true wrestling story that deserved to be told... Better than this.
","I was genuinely hoping for a special movie since all the awards shows and ratings raved about this movie. Plus the fact real wrestlers deserve something better than ""Vision Quest"" to portray what real wrestling looks like. What a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>This is Olympic-quality wrestling, not the WWF and that fake garbage. True wrestling. The sport ancient Olympians in Greece spent their entire lives trying to perfect with their bodies. Wrestling is one of the most graceful, powerful, challenging sports in the world. Anyone who ever participated in this sport will attest to the mental and physical toughness required. It also isn't for everyone as it can be slow, uneven and boring to someone who has never suffered through drastic weight loss, brutal practice sessions in 100+ degree gymnasiums, psychological games by coaches and competitors alike, as well as the (sometimes) inhumane practice facilities with which the sport associates.<br/><br/>The real-life story is horrible. du Pont was a nutcase with too much money and the Schultz' were probably a little too desperate/trusting for their own good. But this movie is simply not good. The cinematography is gorgeous and the actors definitely go against their normal stereotypes. However, I believe the subjects deserved a more honest treatment and are not nearly as lummox-like as portrayed. Both wrestlers were beasts (in a good way) and two of the most powerful, beautiful, graceful wrestlers who ever wore a United States wrestling singlet. They were GREAT. I wish I could say the same thing about this movie. It is average at best.<br/><br/>I met Mark Schultz decades ago after his 1984 gold medal and before the events of this movie transpired. Mark was kind, supportive and intelligent in real-life. I can say without equivocation that the Channing Tatum ""lummox/Neanderthal"" portrayed in the movie is not close to the talented, good man in real life. Mark Schultz deserved better. I never met John du Pont or Dave Schultz but can assume they were caricatures as well.<br/><br/>It pains me to say this as an ex-wrestler, but this movie BORED me. You have two of the most fascinating American wrestlers in history but you barely see them in their glory. It felt like watching two overweight super-heavyweights in the middle of a stalling match where the referee waits and waits and waits for someone to make a move... that never shows up until the VERY end, after the audience is already done watching and doesn't care anymore.<br/><br/>From a wrestler's standpoint, I'd say the original true story was worthy of a trip to the Olympics in the Greco-Roman style but not worthy of making the medal round. The story probably deserved to be told but as a documentary, not mainstream. This movie is more like a high school single-A state champion who stalls too much and, when up against better competition from worthy champions (better movies), this movie isn't good enough to make a college team, let alone make it to the Olympics. 5 out of 10 is the best I could give it and that's only because I like the Schultz boys and what they brought to a great sport. The movie really isn't worth your time. Pleeeeeez make a better wrestling movie, Hollywood. Still waiting for something to beat ""Vision Quest"" as a decent wrestling movie. Probably just wishful thinking..."
"bandw","4","0","1","19 September 2015"," Not much to it
","(spoilers) The story details the relationship between multi-millionaire John DuPont and the Schultz brothers (Mark and Dave), world class wrestlers. DuPont was interested in promoting wrestling, particularly in promoting Mark in world championships and then in the 1988 Olympics. DuPont established an upscale wrestling training facility on his extravagant estate in Pennsylvania, called Foxcatcher. After enticing Mark to train at Foxcatcher DuPont was set on getting Dave to come as well. There was a big build-up about DuPont wanting Dave and Dave not wanting to come, but then all of a sudden Dave shows up with no explanation given.<br/><br/>I think there are two things that attract an audience to this movie. One is seeing Steve Corell in a dramatic role and the other is the knowledge of the tragic ending. It *is* a surprise to see Corell in this movie and almost immediately my reaction to his performance of DuPont was ""creepy."" But Corell never gets away from a one-note interpretation. Obviously DuPont was slipping into some serious mental state by the time he murdered Dave, but Corell plays DuPont the same throughout. Corell has received kudos for getting DuPont right, but if you look at the YouTube video of DuPont (google ""DuPont video"") I find the DuPont there to have much more of a normal vocal range and appear to be somewhat normal, albeit a bit idiosyncratic, in his interpersonal behaviors. Also, he is much more physically fit than Corell. Can you picture Corell's DuPont enjoying a fishing trip? There is heavy focus on Corell's large nose (exaggerated from DuPont's real nose, if you look at photos of DuPont). Corell must have felt that he need have done no more than show up with this nose in order for his performance to be highly rated. At every possible opportunity Corell is filmed in profile. <br/><br/>If Corell's performance is unvarying, Channing Tatum's, as Mark, is not much better. His performance consists of a deliberate walk, a worried look, and a monotone voice. The word automaton comes to mind.<br/><br/>The only actors who have any screen presence are Mark Ruffalo, as Dave, and Vanessa Redgrave (in a cameo performance), as DuPont's mother. Without Ruffalo this affair would have been quite tedious.<br/><br/>There is a goodly amount of wrestling footage, both training and competition. If you don't find that sport particularly appealing, then you will likely feel the urge to fast forward over that footage.<br/><br/>The score, which frequently is no more than an ominous low note, is effective only if you know that there is going to be a tragic end.<br/><br/>In summary, what you have is: the novelty of Carell in a dramatic role, the grotesquerie of the nose, some wrestling footage, and a murder. Not enough to compel my full attention for two hours.<br/><br/>I think a documentary about DuPont would be more interesting than this movie. For all his creepyness, he was a complex character with diverse interests and talents; his contributions as a philanthropist were significant."

","This movie is based on the true events of Olympic champion wrestlers Mark and David Schultz and their odd relationship with eccentric millionaire John Du Pont. The story centers around Mark (Channing Tatum) who is first to develop a relationship with wrestling enthusiast Du Pont (Steve Carrell). Du Pont wants so badly to be the coach of the next Olympic gold medalist and takes Mark under his wing. Mark's older brother David (Mark Ruffalo) has always looked out for his younger brother and begins to worry. Du Pont convinces David to join them at his estate. Once there David realizes his brother isn't the same and has questions the validity of Du Ponts actions. After a loss in the '88 Soule Olympics things really take a turn for the worse, which tragically ends terrible for the brothers as Du Ponts grip on reality slips away. I went into this movie not knowing any of the actual story and I found myself wanting badly to step in and do something. It really is a tragic and odd story. Overall the movie is well put together and Carrell is outstanding as John Du Pont. Ruffalo and Tatum were fantastic as the brothers Schultz. They trained so much you'd think they actually wrestled in school. That being said, this one isn't for me. I can't place my finger on it but I just couldn't get into it.

","Foxcatcher seems to ride that fine line between a sports film with masculine themes and an artistically filmed movie looking to put a unique spin on the world of professional and Olympic wrestling. Being drawn towards films that like to try and mesh together two worlds that seem on opposite ends of the spectrum, I expected Foxcatcher to be a stark portrayal of the life of Mark Schultz, however, upon watching it things became clear that the movie was about John Du Pont, Mark, and his brother Dave Schultz, which was unexpected, but not the problem.<br/><br/>As tragic as the story is, the problem is in how things unfold. Granted that working with a true story puts some limits on artistic license, little is done to really heighten the tension in the film to a boiling point. Even when things seem at their most tense, a lack of atmosphere and soundtrack always keeps things too bleak and saturated for the sake of realism to make it any bit interesting or fun to watch. Foxcatcher feels like more of an education of the story of the Schultz brothers more than a film to entertain.<br/><br/>Which leads me to my next problem with the film. If it is a film to educate, it does very little in terms of explaining the sport of wrestling to help understand the matches we witness and elevate the intensity. Two types of movie goers I would expect are most likely to watch this movie, and they would be wrestlers and/or fans of professional wrestling, or movie buffs. But given the dedication to their art and life long practice of sports, I don't see many serious wrestlers taking to watching serious films spotlighting cinematography, dialog, saturation, aesthetics; the look of the film, the sound editing, and attention to detail that otherwise does this film justice.<br/><br/>Having friends that wrestle, I know that they haven't even seen the movie, nor do they seem to care to. So it seems that little was done to make sure that Foxcatcher hit its target audience. The lack of attention it got during the Academy Awards outside of a few nominations could be further evidence that while well received, it just isn't all that interesting. Its long, well shot, but slow paced, and not in a good way. The film just doesn't resonate as well as it's other contemporaries do.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of both wrestling and artistically filmed movies, or a fan of true stories, then by all means, this movie will perhaps be for you. For everyone else, I cannot recommend Foxcatcher for any reason other than that of curiosity."

","When I heard they were making a movie about the murder of David Schultz by John E du Pont, I was really excited to see it. Usually when they make films about true crime they tend to jazz it up a bit for cinematic purposes. With Foxcatcher, it's like they deliberately made it more boring.<br/><br/>The film starts with Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), a down on his luck wrestler who lives in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo ). He receives an invitation from eccentric gazillionaire and wrestling aficionado John E du Pont (Steve Carrel with a fake nose). Du Pont sponsors Mark, introduces him to cocaine and acts as a weird ""father figure"" to him. All the while, he battles his mommy issues. After a while, David comes to the du Pont estate and Mark is on his way out. Oh, yeah and then John du Pont shoots David and Mark takes up cage fighting. Thrilling stuff.<br/><br/>Normally, I don't have issues with slow paced character studies. But this film moves at the pace of a sloth on ambien. The whole thing is filled with random shots where nothing happens and awkward pauses. The characters are not interesting enough to get into. OK we get it, du Pont is rich and creepy, Mark hit his head on the mat one too many times and David is an upstanding family man. The real life John E du Pont was a certifiable loon yet the filmmakers choose to downplay the crazy. The film is incredibly dry with not one bit of humor and takes itself so seriously. It almost comes off as pretentious. <br/><br/>However, there are positives. Carrell and Ruffalo are great in their roles and well, at least Tatum looks like a wrestler. The film is beautifully shot, especially the outdoor scenes. The wrestling looks like wrestling more or less. If you want to see Channing Tatum in a singlet, here is your chance. Don't watch this if you are expecting a sports or true crime movie. However, if you are a huge wrestling fan or just like to watch two dudes stare awkwardly at each other, this film may be right up your alley."

","As a fan of both film and sport, I have always been disappointed that films have not caught the essence and drama of athletic competition. Even some films that have been highly regarded such as Field of Dreams miss the mark as far as I'm concerned. Foxcatcher is an exception. <br/><br/>There are themes in the movie which transcend sport for sure. The deference that a deranged John E. DuPont was able to garner purely because of his wealth reflects modern American values. <br/><br/>But wealthy or not, he was clearly a fish out of water in the world of high class athletes. The movie captures this perfectly by its accurate portrayal of the two brothers. Their personalities were different but they shared a devotion to sport and achievement. Sport defined their lives and the movie reflects that. To be sure, in a non-revenue sport such as wrestling, they needed financial support but they were nonetheless insulated culturally by their athleticism. Thus their relationship with the wannabe DuPont had to be strained.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake was the straight presentation of the wrestling scenes. There was none of the music, quick cuts, and choreography that Hollywood usually uses to virtually destroy the beauty of real competition. <br/><br/>Foxcatcher might not be the movie of the year but it is certainly the sports movie of the decade!"

This is not a sports movie, but a slow-burning character study (like Miller's first acclaimed film, ""Capote"") in which the wrestling serves as the visual, physical expression of the psychological struggle between the characters.<br/><br/>When we first meet Mark, played by Channing Tatum, whose versatility continues to amaze, it's 1987 and he is living in the faded glory of his 1984 gold medal. Despite his success, he is living a rather lonely life and itching to accomplish more; his brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), also won gold and Dave feels that leaves him with something to prove. So when John do Pont (Steve Carell) contacts him about paying him to come train at his top-notch facility on his family's estate, Foxcatcher Farm, he sees his opportunity.<br/><br/>Mark and do Pont's philosophies about striving to be the best align, and the two form a close, almost father-and-son bond, though more so because they both feel pressure to live up to others' expectations. Du Pont, in particular, wants to prove himself to his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), who breeds world class horses and finds wrestling barbaric. John's desperation, bottomless checkbook and unresolved family issues make for a dangerous combination, and his relationship with Mark slowly begins to change for the worse. Further complicating the matter is Dave, the only man capable of saving Mark from his demanding expectations of himself and whose coaching expertise intimidates due Pont."

However, with Foxcatcher both of these actors are daring to try something out of their comfort zone. That's the reason why I was so excited to see this film.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum has really come a long way since his Step Up days (when in mood for puns you could even say he ""stepped up""). Looking at the massive success of 21 & 22 Jump Street I wouldn't have been shocked if Tatum continued to do comedies. Instead he chose to do a dramatic role with the director of Moneyball, Bennett Miller. A ballsy move, but one that pays off. He completely changes himself into a different person in this film. Yes, at first glance you would pass him off as a big bulky gym junkie, but there is more to him than that. He wants to be the best, to be seen as a hero. In his quest for greatness, Tatum effectively shows the jealousy and competitiveness of his character. A quest that inevitably alienates him from his loved ones. As for Steve Carell, he has the obvious physical changes but the dramatic transformation he goes through is much more impressive. His character John presents himself as a visionary and a leader. However, that is all a façade he hides his insecurities behind. His need for approval makes him manipulate people and his own public image. The more this need grows, the more questionable decisions he makes that constantly builds the tension between him and the rest of the cast. Their relation together is what makes the audience remain on the edge.<br/><br/>One thing I should mention that some people may have a problem with, the length of the movie. I personally enjoyed the slow pace because it made sense with the psychology of the lead characters. That slow burn and tension led to a narrative climax that I physically reacted to. The only reason I bring this up is because I did notice several people leaving the cinema well before the film ended. The number of people was significant enough that it made me wonder if I was the only one who didn't mind the pacing. Nevertheless, I'm just cautioning you in case that does happen to be of any concern.<br/><br/>In the end, I really liked Foxcatcher. It is always great to see actors take risks, even more so when they succeed. Tatum and Carell certainly did succeed, and I hope this isn't the last we see of them in a dramatic role.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","From the director of Capote & Moneyball comes another biopic, this time concerning the multi- millionaire John du Pont which mainly covers his relationship with 1984 Olympic gold medalists, Mark & Dave Schultz. And even though Foxcatcher looks like an interesting character study on paper, the film itself is quite a tedious experience for the most part.<br/><br/>The story of Foxcatcher concerns John du Pont; heir of the multimillionaire Du Pont family & a wrestling enthusiast who recruits the 1984 Olympic gold medal-winning US wrestlers & brothers, Mark & Dave Schultz, in order to help coach aspiring US wrestlers for upcoming tournaments. The plot also tries to capture the relationship dynamics between these three characters.<br/><br/>Directed by Bennett Miller, the film starts working on developing a motive behind what actually led real-life John du Pont take such an extreme action considering that there's possibly none in reality but it's so static, uninspiring & unappealing at times that it becomes a chore rather than an immersive drama. The technical aspects are fine mostly but it's the performances where the film excels.<br/><br/>The cast comprises of Steve Carell, Channing Tatum & Mark Ruffalo, and the trio have done a terrific job in their given roles. It's a shame that the narrative is unable to keep the interest alive for the actors gave everything they had & are simply fabulous. Carell obviously is the biggest surprise here as the unhinged character but chemistry between Tatum & Ruffalo is also pretty much spot-on.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Foxcatcher feels like one of those boring lectures featuring a teacher who's is reading out loud in front of the class but simply lacks the imagination to make the lectures interesting or engaging for the students. It had the resources & it had a fitting cast to pull it off but in the end, there's no reward for sitting through this slow burner. Watch it only for the trio of excellent performances."

","Bennet miller is a director whom I didn't know anything about, I loved moneyball and when I heard that he is the director of foxcatcher I got more excited. His movies are somehow slow paced, but for me watching foxcatcher I never for one second felt bored or even took a look at my phone, the actors performance is top notch mark ruffalo completely unrecognizable. Channing tatum may be the best performance he ever gave and of course Steve carell is amazing. You never see the ending coming and although I know about the true story, I was completely shocked watching it and the way they executed it. Definitely one of the best movies of the year for the amazing performances."
"ydnar123","Null","0","2","19 February 2015"," Not as strong as the book, but still very good
","Foxcatcher is all about the performances. The main cast are all incredible. Steve Carell pulls off what is certainly a performance of a lifetime for a man who has been known for comedy roles. Carell may not win an Oscar for this film but it did earn him his first nomination and its hard not to cheer for him as the Oscars approach. Mark Ruffalo also received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Dave Schultz but its Channing Tatum who surprises me out of the whole cast. Tatum shows that he is certainly capable of playing a serious role and he doesn't always have to be a big box office draw. I read Mark Schultz's (who makes a cameo in the film if you know his story see if you can point him out) biography prior to watching the Foxcatcher movie and sure it does not necessarily follow the most true story but the film is still effective. The film was a lot darker and more thriller like than I had expected as I figured it would be more of an intense sport film. The ending of course is a pivotal part of the film and I will not give it away but if you are unaware of the Foxcatcher story it will likely shock you and I think that is why this film has gotten such critical acclaim because its a true story that many people are completely unaware of. If you're a fan of sports movie I would maybe sit this film out because it certainly not full of action but if you want to see some amazing acting Foxcatcher is a film for you."

","Foxcatcher tells the story of John Du Pont and the Olympic winning Schultz brothers. Directed by Bennett Miller, Firstly i would like to say i went in to this film blind, and didn't really even know it was a true story, I think I enjoyed it more because of this and i suggest anyone else who wants to watch it do the same.<br/><br/>The story is basically i very rich man trying to help out Mark Schultz played by channing tatum in his bid to defend his olympic gold medal in wrestling, the rich man is called John du Pont played brilliantly by steve carell. Its a very character driven movie which often leads to long scenes with very little dialogue, this is where i feel the movie stagnates a little, and overall the movie is possibly 20 minutes too long. <br/><br/>However the relationships between the three main characters is where this film is most interesting, where there are always undertones of what each of them is thinking but it is never spelt out for the viewer. Steve carell in my opinion steals the film with a very good performance playing of a very peculiar man who you can never really work out.<br/><br/>Overall a very solid drama and i believe if you like drama you will enjoy this movie immensely , however if your looking for a rocky style underdog sports movie you might want to give this one a pass."

","The greatest Olympic Wrestling Champion brother team joins Team Foxcatcher led by multimillionaire sponsor John E. du Pont as they train for the 1988 games in Seoul - a union that leads to unlikely circumstances.<br/><br/>Despite some great acting from Mark Ruffalo and especially Steve Carell, this film seems to fall flat. Is it about wrestling? The events leading up to a tragedy? The relationship of two brothers? We seem to get such a general view of each part that nothing is ever looked at in any depth and this leaves the film somewhat hollow.<br/><br/>The number of Academy Award nomination is a bit surprising. It will likely end up being the most nominated in 2014 with the fewest wins. Carell, though great, is overshadowed by Eddie Redmayne, for example. A makeup award is possible, but only if the voters snub ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for what was obviously a good deal of time-consuming design. (This would not be a complete shock, though... just consider how many horror films do not even receive a nomination for their effects.)"
"jposhea8888-1978","6","0","4","8 February 2015"," John du Pont was a supercilious smug sick little sh^% with an Oedipus complex!
","Most sites will have this tagged for sports, but this is not a sports movie insomuch as it is a study of utterly flawed folk with whom wrestling is a shared passion. The acting was such that I had to refer back to the credits to make sure I was seeing what, better yet, who I was seeing. Physically they morphed and maybe in digital day today that's not a huge feat, but what blew my hair back was their stunted speech, the phonetics, pitch, and cadence were marvelously (a term I seldom use) morphed. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo f'ing nailed his portrayal of ""David Schultz"", older brother to Mark Schultz portrayed by Channing Tatum. This strong showing and follow-up to ""Begin Again"", makes me wonder if Mark's days of flying the cusp of film radar are finally numbered. I'd like to see the ""Collateral"" Mark pulverize the ""ESOTSM"" lovable non-threatening emasculating Mark and churn-out IDK what kinda' tantalizing titan, torrent-tearing thing, but his range has yet been harnessed or exploited. It's there when he decides to entrust a director/script to snatch it out, take notice! (Sorry about the Mark R. PSA folks, weird). <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a 'tour de force' performance from Channing Tatum and I was correct not doing so. That's not to say there was a dearth of fine acting or that he disappoints at all. Succinctly stated, you know what you're getting with C.T. and its quality, with performance propelling the plot well-enough, passing grades, all safely within the bell curve's standard deviation. What eludes him the one rarefied role, the part where you realize to go balls out, all in! You make it your own, so much so that it becomes blasphemy for the viewer to envision any other! We're unable to divorce you the actor from you the character unable to envision another doing the role, i.e. Joe Pesci in Goodfellas...need I say more? To think it's been c 25yrs since Pesci did what 95 out of a 100 fail to do, he had become another MFer! <br/><br/>I call those seldom seen sacred souls who've transcended the bell curve my 5-Percenters'. They are not outside the bell curve by chance, happenstance, balderdash or a by a pinch of pixie-dust and pitiful portrayals. We hear words, phrases carelessly cast in vain to attempt to qualify these rare 5-percenters: Sayings such as something clicked, or right place and right time, to the stars aligned for him/her, and the always fun one, he/she seems to simply stumble into incredible roles. Then there is the omnipresent term intangibles! Let's not shun my favorite and guilty of deferring to, he has the ""IT"" factor, the thingamajig factor and so on. None of these individual remarks or the entire lot all bundled together for that matter ever even comes within a solar system of the real WHY. <br/><br/>The real reason why 1 of 20 become wildly successful, attaining GOD- like status, cult figures, iconoclastic stature, impervious and immune to critique, divorced from reliance on others for support, and a truly transcendent 5-Percenter is a bit more messy than the aforementioned. Try to venture upon an unfathomable voyage right thru a mind fraught with fright and mental roadblocks dead set upon reaching the mind's limitations and incessantly mocked yet we forge on. Upon approaching the dark recesses of self is the EGO barricaded with an Event Horizon (term used to indicate grasp, finality no turning back, bound by black-hole gravity). And where 95 others see no alternative but to turn back and preserve their minds integrity and their ego go no further, a 5-Percenter marches on into the mental murk of mind verse self. They summited the apex of ego, dropped from the zenith of complacency nailing thru narcissism on the way, and glided gently into the all-elusive ether sphere and disappear in character. Let's not fail to mention they have painstakingly lusted, labored away life and love to go outside the safe conforms of the bell curve beyond the 95% of average dregs. <br/><br/>How's that for but I digress? <br/><br/>With regard to Channing Tatum one thing's for sure, time is on his side and potential locked within and one thing for certain, his star is rising and not waning at the moment, all in all, time will tell. All other comedies and jump-streets are fine and dandy and he's demonstrated comedic timing to boot. Channing Tatum did not disappoint in ""Foxcatcher."" I have watched his work on a limited basis and had mild expectations this go around. His acting in ""The Eagle"" was up to snuff and I enjoyed ""Dear John."" The role that materialized here called on many of C.T.s strengths and if one doesn't know---wait, I don't know. I am unaware if it was tailored to Tatum or did he modify the role befitting his strengths?<br/><br/>""Mark Schultz"", a tragic figure of what seems not entirely his own doing. Its subtlety suggested that their younger life was filled with gypsy wanderings explain some of the antisocial behavior and his aversion to new faces and unfamiliar places. He's essentially the flawed heroin athlete and patriot abandon by society (or a manifestation of his lonely life). Mark is never given his rightful due. He's overshadowed by his older brother who's also a gold- medalist, however more adjusted fairly well to family life off the wrestling mat. David, the older brother, has weaved a warm, stable environment for his caring wife and two doting kids. For whatever reason Mark was unable to function on his own, and free of his brother's gaze. His older brother is also a father figure and his support structure. I'd venture to say his entire upbringing and existence was fabricated by his older brother.................<br/><br/>*The rest you need to request, 1000 word limit, lame. length 1549<br/><br/>score 62"

","I really wanted to like this movie, and didn't exact not like it, but it fell a little short for me. I think it came own to the length and the drawn out way the movie was delivered. Learning a little bit about the real du Pont, he seems a little unhinged suffering some psychological issues. This was really only shown on a small scale in this movie as you get that du Pont is a little odd and not quite normal, but not quite like the guy was in real life. I was looking forward to Steve Carell's performance, which is really good, but doesn't quite catch this. Channing Tatum as Mark Schulz is great, and Mark Ruffalo as David Schulz is even better. Really like the relationship between these two brothers. I knew nothing about this story and thought it was really interesting, despite some of the slowness.

","A very difficult film to wrap your head around, yet not the type that is so haunting or deep you will be thinking about it for long. ""Foxcatcher"" isn't the masterpiece we were promised by the amazing hype surrounding it, nor is it worthy of all of its awards attention, especially considering other films which were left out in favor of it..ahem..Damein Chazelle..ahem..Jake Gyllenhal, yet in no way is this a bad movie.<br/><br/>I have to address this up front, because it is the thing that is bugging me the most: the direction. It is excruciating ambiguous to the point that you could call it brilliant and weak at the same time. There are elements where the direction shines very bright: the movie looks amazing, the way by which it moves through the drama is clearly the way in which it is intended to be and most of all the actors give amazing performances which are clearly and brilliantly orchestrated by Miller. Yet at the same time, there are astonishing storytelling gaps, really hard to get my head around, lots of aimless scenes that despite never being boring they bring the movie to a length that is really exaggerated. But, most of all I did not get the point. So many elements are left in the shadows, it is such a hard film to read and to understand, there really could have been lots more.<br/><br/>What keeps ""Foxcatcher"" alive are undoubtedly the performances by Carrel, Tatum and Ruffalo, Ruffalo being the best in my opinion. There is definitely more than just makeup to the transformations the actors go through, which ultimately results in three layered, complex and engrossing performances. Tatum and Ruffalo are utterly brilliant and Carrel is equally good if not more, but his performance is immensely toned down by the fact that you just don't have the basic character information or background to get what's the deal about him. The movie goes to great and successful depths to study John DuPont, but at no f**king point did I have some basic tools to interpret him and it was very frustrating. But anyways, because of these stunning performances, the film has a undeniable charm, for the lack of a better word, to it that manages to keep things going on. Yet I can't say the movie ever got me emotionally and tension-wise, and even less when it came to giving me something or making a point. <br/><br/>To sum it up, I really do respect this movie and was engrossed by a good part of it, but it was a little disappointing and I wanted to love it, which I ended up not."

","One of the more darker dramas out locally this weekend, the first question I had when the projector began rolling is, 'why one more in 1.85:1'? What's up with Bennett Miller, who's used this aspect ratio for his movie post-Moneyball, which was filmed in glorious 2.35:1?<br/><br/>Anyway, that became a minor nit to pick as the movie unfolded, and sucked me in.<br/><br/>Steve Carell, moving away from his typical schtick (he has tried before, and was good in the likes of 'Little Miss Sunshine' and 'Seeking a friend for the end of the world' and the like) once again, sinks into his role of John 'Eagle' Du Pont with gusto, making us audience-members just fall shy of closing our eyes whenever his reprehensible characters proceeds to make everyone else uncomfortable on-screen. He comes alive like very few do, and makes us question his existence in the scheme of things.<br/><br/>This has to be the most work done by a young actor like Tatum, that we can see all his hard work translated to the big screen. His every wrestling move, spar and training setup, along with his pent-up feelings are they for us to see, and appreciate.<br/><br/>This is a movie of performances, and the spot-on casting brings them all to life. Mark Ruffalo, on the other hand (as compared to both Carell and Tatum) is perhaps the most seasoned of this bunch, and boy does it show! He comprehensively inhabits the character of the caring elder brother to Channing Tatum's younger 'un, and the kindness, knowledge, understanding and genuine compassion in his eyes is more than any line the screenplay could have had for this actor. This is a complete performance, not just nomination-worthy, but perhaps deserving of a win.<br/><br/>To the plot then: to me, the movie was more about how the privileged, who take everything and everyone for granted, deciding to own another slice of life for their own agenda, and end up taking something precious, something fragile, treating them diffidently and even tenderly for as long as it suited them, and then deciding, even unconsciously/inadvertently, prompted by their more misguided baser emotions, to completely destroy that which they treasured, and finally wondering what went wrong (not even what they did wrong). That's how it plays out, and watching it unfold is nothing short of fascinating, a little more to me than most, due to certain life experiences that hold a very nice mirror to the events unfolding like a juggernaut. <br/><br/>However, I (predominantly) hate biopics. There is no fascination in me to watch something that I've read about somewhere. But I do watch them most of the time, since there are elements that I find fascinating, and it's almost like (even for many others I know) the fascination inherent in watching a trainwreck (nothing to do with the negative connotation there). 127 hours, for example. J Edgar (I know I'm in a minority for that one) being another. Lincoln, and perhaps a few others like Zodiac etc.. Ah, Kill the Messenger was another, and this movie shares something in common with that one, especially the period look-and-feel.<br/><br/>I love it when filmmakers subvert our expectations, like Tarantino did with 'Inglourious Basterds', essentially rewriting history. Fat chance on that happening with this work, but, only for me, due to whatever reason, this happened. Listen closely:<br/><br/>Going in to this viewing, I thought I knew how the story ended, and for me it was all a question of how the characters found themselves at that particular precipice from the moment it began, to when there was a snack break and it began again. Imagine my surprise when I found that I had it all wrong. The main event that eventually takes place, did not happen to one of the key characters I thought it would happen to, but to another key character. And....you could've knocked me down flat. I was like, whaaaaaa....? And I'd thought I knew how it was gonna end. Goes to show. Apparently, from many other accounts, I wasn't the only one who'd got my facts wrong. So, inadvertently, those others and me ended up having a more profound experience for sure, than all those others who knows how it ends in this one.<br/><br/>Pity there wasn't more Anne Bancroft, though the 2 scenes she's in, you could hear a pin drop at the multiplex that I watched this in.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful watch at the cinema, barring the crapfest they had with the subtitles, which were at least 90 seconds ahead of the scene taking place. Bad form, cinema! Bad form, projectionists-who-don't-care-enough-to-stay-throughout-the-viewing. Try requesting the staff to keep those pesky sub-titles off for the viewing, if you care as much."
"MOscarbradley","6","0","3","1 February 2015"," A chilly, forbidding film
","""Foxcatcher"" is a grim, depressing and dislikeable film in which the American Dream turns very sour indeed. It's based on actual characters and events and is totally without humour. There is nothing to eradicate the clammy feeling that something isn't right here. An unrecognizable Steve Carell, (with prosthetic nose), is John du Pont, a member of America's richest family, a man with too much money, too much time on his hands and almost pathological fear and probable hatred of his mother, (a steely, forbidding Vanessa Redgrave), who decides to sponsor and coach brothers Mark and David Schultz and the American Olympic Wrestling Team.<br/><br/>From the outset you know this creepy little man has an agenda other than the straightforward one of seeing his fellow countrymen pick up gold though it's hard to guess exactly what it is. The film never makes explicit du Pont's psychosis. Is he simply a closeted homosexual? Perhaps. Watching it I was reminded of the old gag, ""My mother made me a homosexual"". ""If I gave her the wool would she make me one, too"". (Any joke, even one as lame as this one, would have been welcome during the course of this movie). Or is he looking for the sons he never had or are likely to have? The brothers are played by Channing Tatum, (Mark), and David Ruffalo, (David), and they are both excellent. Tatum is a revelation; there is a touch of Lon Chaney's Lennie in ""Of Mice and Men"" in this performance. He is a lumbering giant, not very bright and almost totally dependent on his brother. Ruffalo has the smaller part and he gives the film its only warmth. Otherwise this is a chilly, downbeat movie and I don't plan on seeing it again any time soon."

","Foxcather is a slow-burning character driven biopic which may not be to everyone's taste. Audience craving for fast based overly dramatized popcorn flicks will find it extremely boring and will fail to grasp the chilling experience. I feel the slow pacing of Foxcather was necessary to build the cold atmosphere needed for the psychological study the movie does of its characters. The trump card here is of course the acting. With surprisingly masterclass performances from Steve Carell, Chaning Tatum and Mark Ruffalo, it makes you feel every emotion and action of its characters.<br/><br/>Based on true events, Foxcather is directly written to screen by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye. Mark Schultz (Chaning Tatum) is a American wrestler who had won an Olympic Gold at LA 1984 yet he doesn't earn much. We see that is house is small and simple. Mark is mentored and trained by his older brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) who has been taking care of him since his childhood after their parents split up. David also was a gold medalist at 1984 Olympics; he is married and loves his family a lot. Mark on the other hand has a feeling he is living in shadow of his brother. Things take a turn when Mark gets an offer from a billionaire and wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont (Steve Carell). John seems to have family issues, with his mother who is obsessed more with her horses rather than appreciate his son's achievement and treating wrestling as low sport. Mark starts training at du Pont's high facility 'Foxcather Farm' moving away from his brother who is unwilling to move his family. The movie then touches how this affects the characters and relations. That's basically the plot with a strong character development which is sorely missing in movies nowadays.<br/><br/>Foxcather is not an eventful film with dramatic twists every now and then. It is a study of characters and their psychology. The main reason it is effective is the acting. Steve Carell's transformation into a sociopath from his routine comedy-flicks is shocking. I had to remind myself that he is the same comedy star. Same applies to Chaning Tatum whose performance has sadly not got much recognition at the awards. Also not to forget Mark Ruffalo who now really looked like Hulk-wrestler with his body. Director Bennet Miller with help of cinematographer Greig Fraser provide a absorbingly sad and chilling atmosphere. Adding to it is Rob Simonsen's haunting background score. Sometimes the silences and the background score convey more of the story than the actual dialogues in some of the long taut shot. But still, I feel at times Foxcather drags a bit too much in parts, the characters simply pause a lot even during regular dialogues. If the film was about 10-15 minutes short I think it would have been a lot more effective.<br/><br/>Overall Foxcather is a deep character study and a psychological drama. The fact that it is based on true events makes it even more chilling. The slow pacing may put off many, but I thoroughly enjoyed the engrossing screenplay and memorable performances.<br/><br/>RATING: [3.5/5]"

"" - Marcus Aurelius<br/><br/>Overall rating: 3.75 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Family value: 2.5 stars<br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... I did not wrestle. But growing up in the Midwest of the US (Iowa) there was always an appreciation and understanding for wrestling. It is an integral part of the culture. There is a mentality and physicality that are unique in the art of wrestling. The personal story of Foxcatcher was not familiar to me, but the director of Moneyball and the three lead performances make this wrestling film irresistible. <br/><br/>No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. - Matthew 6:24<br/><br/>Plot Summary<br/><br/>Many do not know how Olympic athletes get funding for their training, but all people desire to see their countrymen on the champions podium. Foxcatcher is based on actual events that occurred in the mid '80s wrestling community. It is a masterful, mat- based tragedy of an eccentric multi-millionaire, two champion wrestlers and the desire to achieve their goals. Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is given the chance to lead the training of future Olympic wrestlers at a state-of-the art facility by John du Pont (Steve Carell). Striving to get out from under the legendary effect of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo), he eventually pulls his brother into the twisted world of du Pont. <br/><br/>Review <br/><br/>Bennett Miller (Moneyball, Capote) has an uncanny ability to take real life stories that contain elements that are unfamiliar to the general populace and make them accessible and engaging. Foxcatcher has Olympic wrestling as its backdrop, but becomes a tragic tale of money, power and identity. The Shultz brothers were some of the most celebrated wrestlers in US history, but it was the twisted end to their story that gained the most attention. The three leads were almost unrecognisable, but managed to personify their characters brilliantly. Tatum and Ruffalo did a masterful work in showing the mentality and physicality of world class wrestling. The muscle-bound walk, the beautiful brutality, and the close camaraderie of this athletic community helped the understanding of how such a series of events could occur. Miller manages to develop a basic understanding of this world and sets the trajectory for the tragic conclusion. Also, his direction allows Steve Carrell to turn from a comedian into an effective method actor as John du Pont. With the managed intensity of wrestling, the story and performances will hold your attention and leave you exhausted in the end. This is not the feel good movie of the season, but like the hypnotic state of John du Pont, this brilliantly crafted story has a mesmerising effect and is worth the time.<br/><br/>There are many different life lessons that can be taken from the Foxcatcher story, but none stands out more then the impossibility of serving two masters. Looking at the duality between the Shultz brothers, the relationship between Mark Shultz and John duPont, and ultimately between wrestling and money. Miller manages to communicate the impossibility of serving two masters. The film begs the question,""What are you willing to do to achieve your dreams?"" In achieving these goals and dreams, do the very things that allow you to achieve them begin to dictate how you live? Foxcatcher is a film about wrestling, but leaves you considering even deeper things in life. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema...<br/><br/>The story has all that is needed to captivate the audience, but the performances by the three leads take it to a new level of enjoyment. Miller proves that simple, but well told stories continue to have a place in cinema. This film is worth a look. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What can we know about brothers from the Bible? (Proverbs 17:17, Matthew 12:48- 50) 2. Can we love God and money? (Matthew 6:24, 1 Timothy 6:10) 3. What does the Bible say about wealth?

","""Coach is the father. Coach is a mentor. Coach has great power on athlete's life."" Channing Tatum is pushed to his physical limits in director Bennett Miller's American biographical true-crime drama as 1984 Olympic gold medalist and two time world champion US wrestler Mark Schultz, a single late twenties-something washed-up fighter living alone in a drab housing establishment until he receives a call to a shot at the big-time to shine in the upcoming 1988 Olympics in Seoul. <br/><br/>Loosely based on his autobiographical memoir, ""Foxcatcher: The True Story of my Brother's Murder, John du Pont's Madness, and the Quest for Olympic Gold"" is tediously unraveled before us, as we witness brotherhood, competition and tragedy. However, does this film portray how one can become the victor disregarding physical strength and competition? Let's take a look. <br/><br/>Telling his older brother and wrestling trainer/partner Dave (Mark Ruffalo) to come with him, he refuses, as he has settled down with his family and is comfortable now. Flown out to a mansion alone in Pennsylvania, Mark meets up with ornithologist, conchologist, philatelist, coach wrestling enthusiast multimillionaire (and an occasional crack-sniffer with mother issues) John E. du Pont(Steve Carell, a polar opposite of his 'The Office' persona and character voice actor for CGI animated family films to a chilling, almost reptilian performance). Du Pont then invites Mark to join his wrestling team, ""Team Foxcatcher"", to train for the World Championship and be paid for it handsomely as well. Developing a friendship with Mark, he confesses to him later on in the film how he was the only other friend he ever had, whereas his first one was only paid to be his growing up by his mother, Jean du Pont (Venessa Regrave, now wheelchair-bound and seeing wrestling as a ""low sport"", she does not like seeing her son be brought low). Du Pont did not discover his ""friend"" was being paid until he was sixteen. Later on when Dave does come down, along with the family, Mark's self-esteem is damaged by du Pont and he pushes Dave and even his coach farther away as he personally focuses on training in hopes of claiming his Olympic victory that follows for his own gain, culminated by an ending as frigid as the weather inhabiting most of the picture.<br/><br/>Slow but hypnotic, chilling and Wes Anderson-esque in feel but not in tone, 'Foxcatcher' indeed proved superb performances, sports action and a quiet demeanor that embraces the film to keep you engaged enough to keep you interested in this harrowing and disturbing character study. With three Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Picture, it is the first to be nominated for Best Director but not Best Picture since 2008. The film was also nominated for five Oscars at the 2015 Academy Awards. With Tatum stating that his role was ""the hardest acting challenge I've had to date"", it truly shows as through this portrait how one man is pushed to give his all against the sting of tournament losses to the extreme against familial loss. Though du Pont passed away in prison in 2010 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and emphysema, Dave's family now resides in North Carolina. And Mark still wants the world to know that though, looking back now in his fifties, he did not go out a loser but ultimately resurfaced a champion."

","It's best if you know nothing about John E. du Pont or the Schultz brothers when going to see Foxcatcher. This whole story was new to me and that definitely added to the enjoyment of watching this , if enjoyment is the right word. Steve Carell is fantastic as Du Pont and there are good performances from Channing Tatum ad Mark Ruffalo. Although the story revolves around wrestling , that is not what this film is really about. it's all about the mind of Du Pont and the further this film goes on you get the feeling that something isn't at all right with this man. you are never quite sure what his motives were for what he was doing , whether it was sexual , or ego based or that he was just lonely. Good film and i wouldn't be surprised if Steve Carrel wins best male actor at the Oscars but i would give it to Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything it was me.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","I saw the trailer for this sports themed film, it definitely looked like something I would like, and I was fascinated by the comedy star from The 40 Year Old Virgin playing a serious role, and with Oscar buzz I went to see it, from Oscar nominated director Bennett Miller (Capote, Moneyball). Based on true events, Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by eccentric multi-millionaire heir John du Pont (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Steve Carell) to help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, he will move on to the du Pont estate and use his new state-of-the-art training facility. Schultz jumps at the opportunity hoping to focus on his training, to regain his former fame and glory, and finally step out of the shadow of his well-respected brother David 'Dave' Schultz (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Mark Ruffalo). Backing Schultz's bid for Gold and driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees this opportunity as the chance to ""coach"" a team of world-class wrestlers, ""Team Foxcatcher"", to become elusively respected by his peers, and more importantly his disapproving mother Jean (Vanessa Redgrave). Mark is flattered by the attention being gained for his work, and he is entranced by the majestic world in which du Pont lives, seeing his benefactor as a father figure, and growing increasingly dependent on his approval. The changing personality of du Pont sees him initially supportive towards Mark at first, but then this turns and he begins to lure him into an unhealthy lifestyle threatening to undermine his training, and eventually du Pont's behaviour becomes erratic as he plays cruel psychological games with him and the athlete's already shaky self-esteem becomes more eroded. Later Dave becomes the fixation for du Pont, he ignores the lacking confidence of both him and Mark, these are things he knows that money cannot buy, the increasing paranoia and alienation toward the brothers follows the trio all the way to the big sporting events. In the end the story of the three men propels to an unexpected and tragic conclusion no-one could have foreseen, where years later du Pont drives to Dave's home, and with no real explanation du Pont shoots Dave at close range three times and drives off, Dave dies in the arms of his wife Nancy (Sienna Miller), the end sees Mark competing in a cage fighter. The closing text tells that Dave was posthumously inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame, he is survived by two children, Mark gave up professional wrestling to become a teacher, du Pont was found guilty of being mentally ill and third degree murder, he was named richest tried murderer in America, he died of natural causes in 2010 whilst in prison. Also starring Anthony Michael Hall as Jack, Guy Boyd as Henry Beck, Brett Rice as Fred Cole and Jackson Frazer as Alexander Schultz. Carell is almost unrecognisable behind the brilliant makeup as the unattractive, twisted and weird sponsor and control freak to the sportsmen, Ruffalo is terrific as the athlete who he switches the attention of later, and Tatum is good as the not too bright unappreciated fighter who wants to prove himself. I am firstly going to say that I watched this film all the way through, to be absolutely honest, it is not completely my kind of thing, I found it a bit too talkative and not too much sport, the lack of music certainly makes that obvious, but it certainly works as a psychological game of wits, and you cannot deny the fantastic performances, a watchable drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"

","Brothers Dave and Mark Schultz both won gold medals for wrestling at the Los Angeles Olympics. Industrialist, philanthropist, and America's richest man John Du Pont prevails upon Mark to join him at his ranch Foxcatcher in order to establish Team Foxcatcher to pursue American wrestling to greater glories.<br/><br/>This film dramatises a real-life series of events with a tragic ending, and highlights excellent performances from Mark Ruffalo and (perhaps unexpectedly) Channing Tatum as the brothers, and a stunning piece of work from Steve Carell. Unrecognisable behind prosthetic nose and teeth, Carell manages to give Du Pont a pair of eyes which are barely human: every second he is on screen, you are acutely aware that there is something very, very wrong with him. It is a stunning performance judged by any criteria, but given Carell's comedy background it comes as a huge shock.<br/><br/>If only that were all. But it is unfortunate that these performances inhabit a film which has two major flaws. The first is the running time. At 130 minutes, the film drags terribly. Right from the opening sequence of the brothers training, scenes make their point and then drag on and on to increasingly little point. And the other flaw is that, after all that, I'm none the wiser. What caused the deterioration in the relationship between Mark and Du Pont? Was there some sort of homosexual interaction? If so, nothing was spelled out. What led to the final events? Was it simply a reaction to the mother's death? Again, no explanation was offered, and I needed a little bit of resolution in terms of understanding why these things had happened.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller is nominated for Best Director Oscar this year. He doesn't deserve to win."

(Played by Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo.) Director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) does a fine job directing, leaving enough room for the actors to do their thing, acting the s h i t out of this movie. Du Pont is your classic elitist, one percenter and heir to the Du Pont chemical fortune.

With a hard-on for wrestling, Du Pont uses his extreme wealth to amass his own team hell bent on Olympic glory. Enter the Shultz brothers, who are already Olympic winners and the desire of Du Pont, they are flown to his estate to live and train. It's here that Du Pont starts to lose his mentor like grasp on the one brother while being jealous of the other. If I'm being vague with the plot, it's for good reason.

","Even if you don't know a thing about the sport of Olympic wrestling (or for that matter, never watch it on TV), you'll still be impressed by the intricacies and accuracy at which 2014's Foxcatcher goes about its two- hour plus running time. Based on a true story, this film gives you three actors (Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum) like you've never seen them before. And it provides you with direction from Bennett Miller that translates into calm and confident (almost too calm) with a side of medium cool.<br/><br/>As you watch Foxcatcher, you sense that everyone who worked on it wanted things to be as authentic as possible. You can also tell that the rich cast probably researched their roles as grapplers (and as coaches) and Miller approved what seemed like a thorough script comprised by two writers (Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye). But while ""Catcher"" has one pulverizing scene of violence and great performances, it doesn't quite wring you by the neck like it should. This thing moves at a snail's pace with plenty of mundane atmospherics. It's solid by historical standards but not in same league as the director's previous work (that would be the 2011 masterpiece, Moneyball).<br/><br/>Filmed almost entirely in Pennsylvania (that explains the lack of sunshine and earthy tones) and taking place in the latter part of the 1980's, Foxcatcher tells the real life story of two Olympic wrestlers (Mark Ruffalo as Dave Schultz and Channing Tatum as Mark Schultz) who are befriended, taken in, and mentored by a creepy, dour millionaire named John du Pont (Steve Carell, who's screen presence for some reason gave off a Norman Bates vibe). The 1988 Seoul Olympics are less than a year away and du Pont wants to sponsor his ""Foxcatcher"" team of hungry hopefuls (he lets everyone live on his estate and even builds a wrestling facility for them, how interesting). When things go sour between Mark and John (don't ever slap Channing Tatum across the face and call him an ape, ha ha), their relationship reaches a breaking point and Tatum's Mark leaves to train somewhere else. As Foxcatcher carries on, Dave reluctantly stays around with his family. He continues to live and coach on du Pont's property only to fall to tragedy in the film's final act.<br/><br/>Now if you've read the background on Foxcatcher's true happenings, you're gonna know what occurs a mile away (and it is indeed tragic). The concluding murder scene (as mentioned earlier) is visceral and heartbreaking. However, the monotone journey to get to that point doesn't beef it up much. The closing credits come up and things somehow just turn into a ho hum experience. Case in point: ""Catcher"" jumps from the 88' Seoul Olympics to January 1996 (the time of said murder) within only a scene in a half. What happened in those years? What as an audience did we miss? Editing flap? Possibly.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I predict that on January 15th (the day of the Oscar nominations), Steve Carell will probably be up for Best Actor. With a prosthetic nose, altered face make-up, and false teeth, his portrayal of du Pont is I suppose, an impersonation but still startlingly good. He proves to me that he's found a new niche in Hollywood (call this a comeback since his stints in comedy lately have really gone downhill). I would also endorse the always effective, Mark Ruffalo. He plays David Schultz with a realized sympathy and a heartening level of tolerance. Here's hoping that he gets a supporting nod (it would register as his second in the last five years). As for Foxcatcher itself, it's more of a movie to revel in character study mechanisms than to savor as invigorating, compelling fodder. It occasionally ""catches"" fire only to unabashedly leave you a bit cold.<br/><br/>Of note: Towards ""Catcher's"" conclusion, you'll hear some of its film score completely lifted from the 2002 indie, Gerry. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not, but it's beautiful nonetheless. Oh and look for a central trademark from Bennett Miller when it comes to close-ups with his actors. He seems to love capturing them just thinking or staring forward. It was put to effective use with Brad Pitt in Moneyball and it really seems to work here. Finally, I was torn in wondering whether Carell's du Pont was psychotic, socially inept, lonely, just needed a friend, or had too much easy access to guns (the film doesn't document his defense strategy or his actual murder trial unfortunately). If you haven't seen Foxcatcher yet, there's your recommended multiple choice."
"Semmy-tones","7","0","3","7 January 2015"," Very well done, but just not my cup of tea!
","I have to say, I'm not particularly a fan of sports as subject matter for films. The main reason I watched this movie was because I adore Mark Ruffalo and have loved almost every film he has been in; I thought that this would be enough to maintain my interest. However, viewing this film was akin to sitting in a dentist's waiting room listening to the drill in the distanceI had to force myself to sit through this slow, deliberate, intense, slow, brewing, smouldering – oh and did I mention SLOW, movie. I actually breathed a sigh of relief once the climax happened which took approximately 2 hours, and which I thought would never come.<br/><br/>Although the performances were impressive and couldn't be faulted, and the minimalist script served the tone of the story well, I felt it just failed to deliver what I class as quality entertainment, In fact it was quite painful to watch and though some may consider the nails on the blackboard approach to film-making to be 'entertaining', I do not. I guess it goes back to that philosophical question ""what is Art?"" <br/><br/>An imaginative director can take any subject matter and make it live, die or remain indifferent. To me, this movie was a miserable, serious affair with little life affirming qualities save for the end obituaries detailing how the dead were remembered in the accolades of fame and how the ambitious were demoted to teaching positions but still survived. This is obviously what the direction was aiming at – a tense drama with dry almost clinical camera work and suspense that built and built; that promised an explosion but in the end just gave out a few sparks - one to be exact! In a sense, you could say that it was a very brave attempt by Bennett Miller as a reaction to the very obvious, noisy and spelt out cinema that seems to be dominating Hollywood screens today. Or on the other hand, this manner of creativity could verge on self-indulgence- you decide!<br/><br/>However, that being said, it is a noteworthy film. The performances on all three counts were excellent shedding new light on the hidden talents of Steve Carrell and Channing Tatum both of whom gave memorable depictions of not particularly likable characters. Carrell as Du Pont – an extremely repellent bratty individual with huge Mother issues, Tatum as Mark Shultz, an almost primitive emotionally childish man with a large chip on his shoulder and low self-worth, from which his entire ambition stemmed. Much of the interpretation of the script was left to facial expressions and what was NOT said. This in itself requires a certain talent to put across successfully.<br/><br/>To sum up, don't go and see this if you are impatient and/or have had a bad day at the office – you may want to throw yourself in the path of oncoming traffic once out of the cinema. As far as film making standards go, I give it kudos as a suspenseful character based study, but at the same time I wouldn't be willing (or able) to sit through it again."

","I've been waiting to see this for quite a while now. It's been the prize winning thoroughbred of many a film festival this year. It was glorified and pontificated, hyped and praised as a masterpiece by everyone who saw it at Cannes, it's been a whispered about guarded jewel for a large portion of the year. Then everyone else, you know saw it.<br/><br/>It's a fantastically acted, well-crafted movie, I enjoyed it very much, interesting premise, fascinating real life event, chilling cinematography and music. The problem is that I never felt that the movie dragged but I did feel that they struggled to flesh out the accounts of what happened into something deeply compelling. At times it does feel really stilted though never boring or uninteresting. Many aspects felt heavily emphasized and contrived to flesh out performances or political themes to attract awards voters. Other aspects seem cut, or missing to spare the objections of the families. Bennett Miller mentions in interviews that he agonized and laboured to find a presentable cut of this film and it really shows.<br/><br/>If I'm going to take anything away from this it's an affirmation of what I've known for many years, that Steve Carell and Channing Tatum can act, they've certainly proved that here."
"CharlieGreenCG","7","0","3","6 January 2015"," Impressive. But drags.
","Director Bennett Miller is no stranger to creating successful films, with Moneyball and Capote already on his filmography – both heavily nominated with Oscars. Plus having the credit of leading (the late and great) Phillip Seymour Hoffman to his best lead actor award as Truman Capote. Miller's newest film, Foxcatcher, is heading in the same direction with Oscar-bait written all over it. But is it worthy?<br/><br/>Foxcatcher tells the true story of the dark and fascinating relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. Portrayed by Channing Tatum, Olympic gold medal winner, Mark Schultz is invited by wealthy heir, John du Pont (Steve Carrell) to help train a team of wrestlers for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his state of the art facilities.<br/><br/>Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his own training and to finally jump out of his older brother's shadow, Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Fuelled by paranoia and alienation, the trio is propelled into an ultimatum of tragedy.<br/><br/>Given the nature of the story, the film is reflectively creepy and can be rather uncomfortable viewing – but all in its favour, as it sets the atmosphere in a dark psycho palette of entertainment.<br/><br/>Clocking in at just over two hours, the fruitful story does not urge to ripen quickly, but rather methodically and frustratingly; pacing is slow, some silent scenes drag as the narrative progressively builds to a devastating melodrama. It's seems like a long journey.<br/><br/>To its advantage, and probably one of the main discussions of Foxcatcher, is that all of the lead actors physically transform for their characters. Which, as well as being impeccably mounted are performed incredibly.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell, who stars as John du Pont, is in fact, almost unrecognizable as he covers his face in prosthetic and artificial aging. It's a performance unlike Carrell has ever done before, given his comedic background and often silly roles. It's odd casting, but he is serious, mesmerizing and just wonderful throughout.<br/><br/>Likewise, Channing Tatum is also committed to the role of transformation as he adds Hulk-like biceps and triceps to his already overly-toned body. He shuffles, not walks, and adjusts his Hollywood-lovable face to a bulked and bullied jawline that looks remarkably like the real Schultz.<br/><br/>Overall, it is impressive work - yet drags as the Shakespearean level of story slowly takes place and develops."
"bobsgrock","Null","0","3","6 January 2015"," Distancecatcher
","Can a film be made with all the available technical prowess yet still fail in its ability to relate what it wants to the audience? It has happened before, though usually in science fiction or action- laced stories where special effects and mechanical devices override any characterization or human interest. Yet, in the case of Bennett Miller's Foxcatcher, the result is too much stylistic layout for the sake of not enough dramatic juice to let the story flow smoothly. Watching this film is like witnessing a car engine break down due to losing oil, transmission and coolant simultaneously; this movie needs its essential fluids replenished. <br/><br/>So much has been said already about Steve Carell's performance, but is it anything more than a well-known comic actor under a lot of makeup and prosthetics attempting to disguise himself as a 'serious' actor? Of course, other actors have followed similar paths like this before, but Carell's acting seems too subdued to allow us to be interested in what he is doing. Bennett Miller has always been a director who likes to keep the audience at arm's, or even a parking lot's, distance, so it is hardly surprising that Carell is directed to perform so. Indeed, John du Pont is the most potentially interesting character because he is a seemingly walking paradox. He possesses a doctorate in ornithology, is the heir to the fabulously wealthy and prestigious du Pont chemical corporation. Yet, he is presented, with whatever historical accuracy that can be managed, as a quietly malevolent control freak with serious mommy issues and some ambiguous form of mental illness. All this is deduction, of course. The film has no interest in exploring who du Pont truly was or what motivates him to act as he does. Here, he is merely the lone villain, the obvious bad guy we are supposed to both fear and be fascinated with. In this regard, Carell is creepily effective, but it bodes no goodwill upon the film or our rooting interest in him. He cannot, or will not, be penetrated by the audience.<br/><br/>Opposing this, Channing Tatum may end up being the most revelatory element about the film. Known previously as a handsome but absent- minded meat-head-type actor receiving roles based upon his looks rather than acting ability, Tatum here finds the perfect role for himself, utilizing the typifications of his career in order to portray wrestler Mark Schultz as just what he has been stereotyped as: a mindless, muscular athlete with little to no ability to separate himself from either his brother or the past they share. He wants to individualize and prove himself to be more than a mere fighter of men for sport, but he simultaneously desires leadership and direction within the context of a team and common goal to be attained. This he had with his brother, Dave, and he soon finds it to a weird degree with John du Pont. <br/><br/>While the movie covers this unusual but symbiotic relationship, interest is maintained and Tatum proves himself to be a reliable and intense actor, walking in a slouch and keeping his lower jaw agape like a heavy-breathing animal. Then, the plot begins to gear forward, albeit with somewhat large jumps in plausibility or logic. Firstly, Dave comes to run du Pont's wrestling team with no explanation despite having rejected the same offer earlier. This is never cleared up. Then, the shift focuses from emasculated Mark to the unsettling strangeness of John du Pont as Carell continues to walk around, sometimes with a gun, but always lurking and watching hie beloved team of men and patriots training for American greatness in the upcoming Seoul Olympics. Finally, the inevitable element of this true story establishes its presence, forcing us to watch something that could have easily been left out in order to focus on the characters. Instead, it is presented as the denouement of a true crime TV special, shot abruptly and shockingly, but to no effect upon our sympathies or understanding.<br/><br/>In his review, David Edelstein referred to Foxcatcher as ""a true crime story bloated into looking significant."" He mentions Miller's most lauded film, Capote, as having a similar detached quality, although that film seems to understand better its obsession. It may also help that Capote is a far more interesting character than du Pont, as well as the fact that Phillip Seymour Hoffman is better- suited for these kinds of roles than Steve Carell. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Miller has shown himself capable of visually expanding somewhat thin stories into depressing, but admirable dramas where the look of things trumps nearly anything happening within the frame. Perhaps the one conclusion to be taken from this is that you can get away with this type of storytelling provided you have a fascinating character portrayed by a competent actor. In this case, Carell's brave performance is only that; a gimmicky attempt to distance himself from comedy while simultaneously distancing himself from the audience of Foxcatcher."

","I walked into the theatre only knowing a few things -- Channing Tatum, Steve Carrell, wrestling and Oscar-contender. If that's all you know as well ... stop reading ... go to the movies and watch it ... then come back to us and tell us what you think! Going in cold did make the 134 minutes bearable. A little too long, of course! We all know my disdain for movies longer than 120 minutes and constant cry to Hollywood ""Edit! Edit! Edit!""<br/><br/>But I digress ... this is an amazing story put on screen in a manner that is worthy of the Oscar-talk.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell did a wonderful job as John Du Ponte. And the make-up folks did a wonderful job letting him play this role without us thinking Michael Scott was on the screen. I can only imagine how difficult it is for actors such as Carrell to move beyond such a lovable character -- one that often defines our workspace and conversations. It's hard to be mad at Michael Scott / Steve Carrell therefore without incredible acting and make-up the Foxcatcher story could have been lost when they selected Carrell for the lead role. But it wasn't. If Oscar equals world-class, this team is worthy of the honor.<br/><br/>(I will admit, though, that I think Carrell borrowed some characteristics from Gru in Despicable Me ... just a bit.)<br/><br/>I loved Channing Tatum in this movie. I don't think it's because I'm a woman who loves Channing Tatum -- he earned a lot of street cred playing Mark Schultz. Yes, he is playing a guy that works out a lot. But Mark's character was complex while quiet -- which is very difficult to get across on screen. It's clear Tatum took this role very seriously and stepped up to the challenge.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was outstanding. I don't know if he'll ever get recognized with an award, but I believe he is the premier supporting actor who really pulls out the best acting in the folks that share a screen with him. While Tatum seemed like a natural fit in his role, I was shocked to see Mark Ruffalo on screen as an Olympic wrestler. He was awesome. He was believable. If I were casting a movie, I'd want a role for Ruffalo and Edward Norton. In my humble opinion, these two actors are true chameleons. Except maybe as Hulks (interesting that they both have done those roles ... hmmmm ...)<br/><br/>Reading about the true story and behind the scenes is quite intriguing. In a recent interview, Carrell admits that the actors didn't interact much on set. ""It wasn't anything planned, we just naturally didn't interact, aside from the scenes we were doing. We didn't hang out, or bond,"" he said. Reading other articles it's clear this wasn't a fun set to be on. Many of the real-life characters, including David Shultz's wife Nancy, were on set to bring reality to the movie. It's a very serious movie ... with a very serious message.<br/><br/>And to add to the real-life drama, Mark Shultz is not happy about how his life story ended up on the screen. He lashed out at Director Bennett Miller over the last few weeks regarding a specific scene in the movie ... and the true life saga from Foxcatcher continues.<br/><br/>I believe you will enjoy this movie on-screen and researching the story after wards off- screen. Definitely put it on your list if it is Your Turn To Pick!"

Tatum is a stunner, he amazed me. Ruffalo is perfect as usual, and this mentor/wise-older brother image fits him wonderfully. The scenes are powerful and are created with such a telling style, it is a directorial triumph. This is due to the ability to tastefully depict the a story of three man, with very few words but strong images.<br/><br/>This was the impressionist part now let's see the Pollock side of the picture.<br/><br/>Both the writer and the director loses it, for no reason, they were on a great track, but I guess they (chiefly the writer) had no idea how to get elegantly to the endpoint of the story.<br/><br/>At the middle of the film, it becomes a mess! It gives you nothing, but DEMANDS you to keep on looking at it in awe, even though it is simply not entertaining or any good anymore. Motives become secondary, characters only do things because they have to, so everything goes as the writer and the non-fictional story parts demand it, nothing is at stake because we know that David Schultz gets shot in the end... The complexity and cogency ceases to exist.<br/><br/>Carell is a bit of a disappointment for me, he pulls it off but does not succeed. But I don't blame him. He has no room to act, the director doesn't have any idea how to bring the DuPont out of the actor. He is poorly instructed. Almost no resemblance to the real man, except the broken speaking pattern. Why add 30kgs on Carell, when the guy was sickly skinny? Why make him having the same emotionless face all along, when DuPont rather acted as a schizophrenic, than a robot!? It was supposed to be Carell's big moment, but Tatum triumphed... Thank you Bennett...<br/><br/>I gave it 7 only for the first 60 minutes and Ruffalo & Tatum! Deserves worse!

At one point John decides he doesn't like Mark's training method so he pays out Dave's contract and gets Dave to join Team Foxcatcher.<br/><br/>John tries to serve his ego using Team Foxcatcher by introducing Mark as his protégé, claiming the title of the team's coach and making Dave only the assistant coach, filming a documentary about the team's preparation on winning the Olympics, and even returning into practicing the sport disregarding his old age. Even since before Dave arrive, John slowly poisons Mark with bad habit of drinking, skipping practice and even cocaine. This influences Mark significantly that Mark lost his first match on the Olympics selection. Mark is devastated by the defeat but Dave comes to him and helps him sobers up and prepares so eventually Mark wins the slot for the Olympics. But in helping Mark prepare, Dave prohibits John from seeing Mark. Mark feels this and asks Dave to quit the team together but Dave says they have to stay with their commitment. But Dave also sees what's coming and forces a deal to John that if John wants to keep Dave on the team even after the Olympics, John has to keep paying Mark.<br/><br/>John agrees to the deal because Dave and Mark agree to let John stand at Mark's corner in the Olympics. They go to Seoul for the Olympic game but Mark loses his matches. Back at home, Mark retires from professional wrestling while Dave stays to coach Team Foxcatcher. But one day, after seeing the completed documentary film he commissioned, John goes to drive on a car. He drives past Dave's place but then reversed the car to see Dave. Dave goes to greet him but John suddenly points out a gun at him. After asking a weird question, John shoots at Dave. He then runs away with his car.John soon gets arrested, convicted and goes to prison. Mark still scrapes for money, this time in the then up and coming sport of MMA.<br/><br/>The story nicely depicts the fate of athletes of less favored sports. Even though highly talented on the sport, some of the athletes and retired athletes face the same life as Mark's life depicted on this movie's start and end. The middle and focus part of the story portrays even a classic nature of man, that power, in this case deriving from one's wealth, ends up corrupting the owner. We can see the movie depicts how John gets to be erratic and selfish due to not knowing where or what else to spend his wealth on. <br/><br/>John feels that everybody can be bought with a certain amount of money. He doesn't seem to think of other people as equals to him due to this. His first impression of seeming to appreciate Mark on his early appearance in this movie seems to be root on that there is something that he wants in Mark, which is to win the Olympic gold medal.<br/><br/>I really like how the actors delve deep into the real techniques of the sport thus enabling this movie to portray the actors doing the sport as how it is meant to be done. I don't know if instead Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum actually have any background in wrestling, but if they don't, they turn out to be well enough wrestlers themselves to be able to execute such techniques well.<br/><br/>The acting in general is a great job. Channing Tatum is successful in depicting the almost desperate athlete looking for money. Although I must say that his role here doesn't really have his expressions to come out. Mark Ruffalo also acted well as the close brother yet now distanced by his responsibilities for his own family. But surprisingly, Steve Carrell's performance as John Du Pont is a great job in this movie. He really nailed the role, transforming into a totally different person. This is especially true when we compare it to Carrell's other works, most notably comedies in which he played the roles of less witted males.<br/><br/>My say is that Foxcatcher (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation. It's too bad that this movie doesn't really get distributed globally because with this level of acting and depicting a story based on true events, it surely succeeds in telling the serious story of athletes' struggle."
"stephendaxter","7","0","4","2 January 2015"," A slight disappointment that drags on for too long but redeems itself with great acting performances
","Foxcatcher was a movie that i was eager to watch since the very first trailer hit. With a cast of Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, and an almost unrecognizable Steve Carell portraying characters in a true story; it was very hard to turn away from seeing this. After watching it i can say that i was a little disappointed by this film for a number of reasons, but the performances of the actors was not one. All three actors mentioned above gave pretty amazing and very convincing performances that were the driving force making me continue to watch this film with eyes open for the entire runtime, a runtime that went for far too long in thought. When a movie makes me constantly look at the time from just after the half way point that is a sign of the film being too long. <br/><br/>The 2 hour and 10 minute runtime would have been more sufficient had there a few more key moments for the film to build up to. But the writing let the film down and didn't get me as invested in the overall plot as i should have been. The finale of the film was one that definitely caught me slightly off guard, and redeemed a little of what i was looking for throughout the film. So in the end Foxcatcher was still a good film with great performances but suffered from a long runtime with unfortunately not too many key events to keep me very interested - 7"
"ZeeRaaN","6","0","3","31 December 2014"," good performances can save a slow paced film
","Great Performance by the entire cast. amazing music score. but a little bit slow paced. also I didn't feel that the director gave us the opportunity to understand the characters better. I still don't see why Mark (Channing Tatum) hated John (Carrel) that much! is it all because of one slap and a one time insult? I'm sure it hurt but does it hurt to the point where he cant even function around him and loose the Olympics just because he was around? I felt like there was a missing link there. because all they showed is how good John was to Mark then suddenly from one insult Mark hated John so very much. they made it look like it was all about the slap and I'm sure there was more to it. also in the shooting scene, I felt like John shot David around the period were Mark left which made me think that Mark had something to do with John's feeling towards his brother. where in reality David was shot 7-8 years after mark has left the farm. I understand that it is hard to understand a man like John du Pont and that David was murdered and no one can get their point of view now, so the movie had to go with the only point of view left which is Mark's. but the movie was a drama about a dysfunctional man and his relationship with the Schultz brothers, so I expected more depth and analysis to their story."
"jake-law123","7","0","3","29 December 2014"," Steve Carell like you've never seen him.
","Seeing Steve Carell on the poster of this is what grabbed me at first. Plus Steve Carell in a drama role, you don't see that too often, so I was interested. I was completely amazed by his performance along with Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum. These 3 really go at it in this compelling drama.<br/><br/>The story follows the true events of Gold Medal winning wrestler Mike Schultz (Channing Tatum), and his transition into the team Foxcatcher while dealing with pressure from his new glory destined coach, (Steve Carell) and back and forth relations with his brother, (Mark Ruffalo).<br/><br/>Steven Carell is very impressive as a troubled, yet strong willed human. The makeup job on him completely immerses him in his character. Channing Tatum, who's last films were 21 and 22 Jump Street, is destined and determined. Mark Ruffalo was probably my favorite performance, he was the perfect support for Tatum in the right moments, and you always felt happy for him because he's always in a cheery mood.<br/><br/>The film's story is told pretty straight forward. It doesn't take any risks or add drama every second that their is. It gives us the determination of each character, and they're the shining knights that push on the story's progression. The film just kind of ebbs and flows, and naturally the conflicts fall into place.<br/><br/>I will say I wasn't heavily sympathetic toward the characters when you were supposed to, just because they didn't focus well enough on their emotions at times. Aside from that, this was a really well told recount of a true story, and is well recommended."
"rutledge3512","6","0","3","28 December 2014"," Worth watching, but certainly not best picture material (Rating 6.5)
","I would give Foxcatcher a 6.5 as it is worth watching, but by no means a title that should be nominated for best picture. Although I could see the merits of a best actor or best supporting actor nomination for Channing Tatum or Steve Carell. <br/><br/>I do not mind a slower paced movie when watching a biopic- But the trade off I expect, is a story line that provides me with insight into the mindset of the main characters and a moderately accurate portrayal of the events (accepting that some parts of the story or time-line must often be condensed, etc).<br/><br/>THE GOOD: We do get a pretty good insight into the characters of Mark Schultz and Dave Schultz... And John Dupont generally.<br/><br/>THE OK: The film provides a decent insight into the relationship of Mark Schultz & Dupont... albeit with a few holes.<br/><br/>THE DISAPPOINTING: We do not get much of an insight at all into the ""Motivations"" of John Dupont. Nor does the movie do a good job of exploring the relationship between John Dupont & Dave Schultz (Ruffalo).<br/><br/>In reality Dave Schultz lived on the Foxcatcher Estate with his family for 6 years (1989-1996), whereas Mark Schultz (Tatum) lived there a much shorter period (which ended in 1988). Additionally, according to the real life story, Dave is the brother that Dupont looked to as a best friend and had the closest relationship with- which the movie almost completely avoids. <br/><br/>OVERALL: Probably worth watching, however afterwards (when you undoubtedly go online to look for the Real Story to fill in some obvious gaps), you will likely be disappointed by the fact that the film almost completely avoids the most essential parts of real life events. (which In my case, left me feeling the movie in many ways was a big fail... as it relates to the biopic trade off between slower story/ in exchange for insight into actual events and characters)."

","WARNING: Do not bring crunchy snacks to this movie. <br/><br/>This movie is damn quiet. Like a Sunday afternoon in 1985. It allowed us to listen to what wasn't being said between the characters, creating genuine moments, and allowing the viewer to share the discomfort of the characters.<br/><br/>Despite the cast, and because of the cast, it really worked. It could have become a blatant race for an Oscar, but instead the actors brought honest performances.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum's recent string of fluffy roles didn't prepare us for the nuanced and powerful performance he was able to deliver. He had few lines of dialogue, but he was still able to communicate his emotions with mature subtlety.<br/><br/>For the role of John DuPont, Steve Carell was able to suppress his usual outlandish persona, and because you know that he is withholding that level of energy under a rigid composure, it adds to the quiet accumulation of frustration of John's character.<br/><br/>Who wouldn't go see this movie, based on the cast. But at least this time, they'll be treated to a great piece of work."
