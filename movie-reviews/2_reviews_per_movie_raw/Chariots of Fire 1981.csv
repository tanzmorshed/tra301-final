"trpdean","Null","118","136","6 March 2002"," Great true story, wonderfully done
","I watched this again last night. I had forgotten just how beautifully done it was - both a character study of two very different men and a gripping plot of their attempts to succeed - partly through athletics. the writer and director so well convey both Cambridge and the Edinburgh Presbyterian missionary disciples, in the early 1920s so very well.<br/><br/>The acting is superb - I had never seen a character presented like Eric Liddell in movies - how fine Ian Charleson was in this role, the softness of his voice, his ease and joy in running competitively (especially in contrast with the tense tortured Harold Abrahams). I also loved the more supporting roles - I've read a biography of F.E. Smith and Nigel Davenport is exactly how I would imagine him. The actor who played the Prince of Wales also seemed exactly right with his effortless charm, looks, and lack of imagination. Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson - all wonderful.<br/><br/>The actors weren't chosen for glamour either - Liddell and Abrahams are not Leni Riefenstahl images of athletic ideals, Liddell's sister is no beauty - and Abrahams' girlfriend is pretty but not stunning. It made them seem more real. (In nice contrast were the near-pretty boy looks of Nigel Havers as Lord Lindsay - it so suited his character).<br/><br/>The races are riveting - partly due to the music and sound effects.<br/><br/>So many small things are done so well - e.g., when Lord Lindsay has the confidence of his class to barge into a room containing the Prince of Wales, and three other lords (including Birkenhead and the head of the British Olympic Committee) and greets them by name - no need for introduction there (as there was for Liddell). It's small but seems quite real.<br/><br/>As an American, it was interesting and funny to see our Olympic team shown as the numerous, ominous, invulnerable ""other""! (something like watching a Rocky movie with Rocky as the product of a Russian or East German success machine!). In fact, the one scene that seemed a bit off was the scene of the American track athletes warming up for the Games - all heavy music, machine like athletes, ferocious coach yelling with a megaphone into people's ears. It pounded too hard on the ""these are the scary almighty inhuman opponents"" theme in contrast to the cheerful British boys running along the beach.<br/><br/>Something I had forgotten about the movie was how stubborn BOTH protagonists are - Liddell fully as much as Abrahams. Liddell is not overly deferential or bashful when dealing with the Prince of Wales - but instead straightforward and very firm. <br/><br/>I truly can't understand anyone not liking this movie - it is very exciting even on the basic level of ""will they win?"" and so much more. (For example, Ian Holm's character's reaction to success after 30 years is very moving). Those who write to say that ""Reds"" deserved the Oscar more - are simply wrong. (Reds was so simplistic that it felt like watching the movie ""The Hardy Boys Go to the Russian Revolution""). Those who say they cannot differentiate among the boys or between the Scottish and English accents - well, it sounds like some political statement to me. <br/><br/>Do watch it - it's very fine, very moving, very exciting."
"Julie-30","9","126","146","26 January 2003"," Truly an outstanding film.
","I beg to differ with several previous reviewers.  This film is neither bland nor is it solely about professionalism vs. amateurism.<br/><br/>This film is about what drives people to do what they do.  Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) runs for the glory of God, whereas Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs to prove his worth to a society that was anti-Semitic.  Even though they run for different reasons, their drive and determination spur them on. They stand up for what they believe in and refuse to sacrifice their principles because it is the easy way out. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is also extraordinary, with Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell, Ian Holm and Sir John Gielgud all making important contributions to the final product. <br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing unnecessary in this film.  The writing, the direction, the acting, the dialogue are all outstanding.  And then there's that haunting score.  <br/><br/>Once again, this is truly an outstanding film. One with universal themes that transcend time and place."
"gachronicled","10","151","180","18 February 2001"," This is one of the Oscar best pictures that actually deserved the honor.
","I happened to be flipping channels today and saw this was on.  Since it had been several years since I last saw it I clicked it on, but didn't mean to stay.  As it happened, I found this film to be just as gripping now as it was before.  My own kids started watching it, too, and enjoyed it - which was even more satisfying for me considering the kind of current junk they're used to.  No, this is not an action-packed thriller, nor are there juicy love scenes between Abrahams and his actress girlfriend.  There is no ""colorful"" language to speak of; no politically correct agenda underlying its tale of a Cambridge Jew and Scottish Christian.<br/><br/>This is a story about what drives people internally - what pushes them to excel or at least to make the attempt to do so.  It is a story about personal and societal values, loyalty, faith, desire to be accepted in society and healthy competition without the utter selfishness that characterizes so much of the athletic endeavors of our day.  Certainly the characters are not alike in their motivation, but the end result is the same as far as their accomplishments.<br/><br/>My early adolescent son (whose favorite movies are all of the Star Wars movies and The Matrix) couldn't stop asking questions throughout the movie he was so hooked.  It was a great educational opportunity as well as entertainment.  If you've never seen this film or it's been a long time, I recommend it unabashedly, regardless of the labels many have tried to give it for being slow-paced or causing boredom.  In addition to the great story - based on real people and events - the photography and the music are fabulous and moving.  It's no mistake that this movie has been spoofed and otherwise stolen from in the last twenty years - it's an unforgettable movie and in my opinion its bashers are those who hate Oscar winners on principle or who don't like the philosophies espoused by its protagonists."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","94","110","17 January 2001"," An engrossing and powerful sports story
","I enjoy sports films, especially when they are used to exemplify greater human truths.  In that regard `Chariots of Fire' is one of my favorite sports films.  What differentiates this film is that it is really a human story about sports rather than a pure sports story.  Based on a true story, it centers on two gifted athletes and their quest to run in the 1924 Olympics.  The first is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a haughty sprinter with an obsession for winning.  Abrahams, who is Jewish, is a man with something to prove, mostly to himself.  His rival is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the first man to ever beat him in a sprint.  Liddell is a devout Christian and runs for the glory of God.<br/><br/>There is an exquisite interplay of subtle themes in this film underlying the obvious sports tale.  There is the contrast of motives.  Abraham runs to validate his feeling of personal power, and his preoccupation with winning is actually motivated by his fear of losing.  His quest is torturous, and ultimately his victory empty, more of a relief than a triumph.  Liddell runs out of a desire to repay God for the physical gifts he has been given.  He is at peace with himself, but at odds with all those who want to control him.  Their rivalry represents a battle between the forces of the physical and spiritual.  Other themes pervade the film.  We have undercurrents of bigotry against the Jewish runner, a man of whom Cambridge was begrudgingly proud while berating him behind his back.  We have sinister political attempts at manipulation in the face of Liddell's staunch integrity in adhering to his principles.  Together, these forces combine to produce a film rich in drama and meaning.<br/><br/>The film has been criticized for its inaccuracies.  Some say Abraham did not suffer from anti-Semitic bigotry and that he was wildly popular at Cambridge.  This does not necessarily mean he didn't feel inferior.  No one can know what childhood experiences might have affected his psyche.  Jackson Scholz was quoted as saying he never gave Liddell a note of encouragement on the track.  I have to agree that this was a bit of Hollywood drivel that didn't need to be there.  Additionally, Liddell knew weeks before that the heats would be on a Sunday, not just before the race as shown, and he was always scheduled to run the 400-meter race.  The meeting of political bigwigs that allowed him to switch from the 100 to the 400 was pure fabrication to emphasize his resistance to compromising his beliefs about running on the Sabbath.  However, these liberties can be forgiven because they enriched the story and did not change history in major ways.<br/><br/>The direction by Hugh Hudson is powerful.  Hudson captures the feeling and excitement of track and field competition, as well as giving us numerous beautifully photographed scenes and a wonderful period rendering.  Though nominated for an Oscar, Hudson was unable to capitalize on the success of this film, and he has directed very few, mostly minor films since.  The music by Vangelis is also wonderful, and it won the Best Music Oscar.<br/><br/>Ben Cross is fantastic as Abrahams.  He brings great intensity to Abrahams' single-minded obsession for winning.  Cross hasn't done much film work since, but has had a long and distinguished career in TV.  Ian Charleson is also excellent as Liddell, but his career went the same route as Cross'.<br/><br/>This minor film was the sleeper of 1981, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture.  I rated it a 10/10.  It combines the best elements of human drama and sport to create a potent and engrossing film."
"admco.c","Null","9","9","13 April 2000"," A classic.
","On a basic level it is the ultimate British Oscar-winning period piece and influential, uplifting feel-good film. Its two chief qualities are its subsequently strong realism and the resonant Vangelis soundtrack that, as with 'Blade Runner', increases the strength and significance of scenes through sound. Although it has a specific setting or historical background, the music adds an appropriate timelessness to the powerfully relevant human themes. These include winning and losing, of having what it takes to run the race, and of the old gentlemanly values of religion, decency and personal honour. It is the determining of the self, the inner strength, by understanding and will. The real-life characters and events are brought to life with the engaging realization that a climax will arrive at the end. At its core is a rivalry, less of a personal one and more the dilemma of two men wanting to win the same race. However, the climax is not predictable for such a straight-forward competition cannot occur. That is to say, they are both dedicated and honest men, with completely different religions, and it is this combination of resolution and talent which enables them both to win their own race. Around this central thread of training and determination, the film-makers have recreated the world surrounding these university characters in the 1920s. Scenes are filled with the casual, graceful attitudes that are a very British ideal; sophisticated prowess, decency, honesty, religion and intellect, values which seem to be less respected in this modern time. It portrays a credible idealism.<br/><br/>One of the first scenes of the film shows the running students. It celebrates this stage in life of onsetting maturity, comraderie and destiny through this bygone group of individual characters, united by the shared realization of their strengths. Throughout there is also the vague impression of higher powers at work, not so much the embedded attitudes of the old generation, but the position of man's humility in experiencing the challenge of life's great race created for them, and not only feeling the love that can be found, but rising to shine in one's own glory, enabled because of the higher glory. Not many viewers, especially today, accept such adherence and orthodoxy to Christianity, that can be seen as the motivation for the character Liddell. This film reminds us of the prominence and influence it had over so many aspects of society and the beneficial, empowering effects it could give to individuals. Alternatively the character Abrahams is a jew, and relies more on the attributes of his character which include a desperate determinism that reaps a reward of its own, takes him to his limits - although of greater significance is the love of a woman which detracts from perhaps a too heightened focus on himself. Through him we must also realise that there will always be those greater than ourselves, the very fact of our losing, and ultimately swallow pride and feel awe and goodness for the victory of our rivals and our friends. At the end of the film, the race has been run; they have gloriously discovered and revelled in their talents, their time, the fruits of aspiring to something greater than themselves. 'For it says in the good book, he that honours me, I will honour'."
"KFL","9","50","65","18 February 2001"," A movie about the fire within
","Much more than just another sports movie, CoF analyzes the very different reasons two men have for devoting so much of their lives to training for the Olympics. This in an era when there were no commercial sponsors and no lucrative endorsement contracts. Though there is always fame and personal satisfaction, it seems to be implied that these things alone are insufficient to explain the special forces that drive these two men so much more than all the others.<br/><br/>This is a truly beautiful movie about a different era, about competition and what may serve as motivation to compete--and perhaps about what kinds of motivation are healthy and what kinds are not.<br/><br/>9/10"
"blue-7","10","50","70","1 February 2005"," Special Edition Is Special!
","Having just picked up (1 Feb. 2005) WB's Special Edition DVD of ""Chariots of Fire"", I am pleased to report that it indeed ""Special""! The major improvement over the original DVD release is, of course, the presentation of the feature in its proper 1.85:1 screen ratio. The feature also has the option of a very fine commentary track by director Hugh Hudson.<br/><br/>Disc 2 includes two outstanding documentary films. ""Wings on Their Heels: The Making of Chariots of Fire"", has interviews with most of the living participants. It is fascinating and very informative. The struggle of the film to get financing is covered as well as the process that took place in finding the lead actors is covered. The excitement of Oscar night, when the film took home the ""Best Picture"" award, is captured through the comments of those who were there.<br/><br/>The second offering, ""Chariots of Fire: A Reunion"", was shot in England with the producer, director, cinematographer, and three of the actors recalling their experiences in working on the film. This is an inspired way of letting the creative people involved recall and share their involvement in film that turned out to be the highlight of their careers.<br/><br/>Both documentary films are a joy to watch, as are the 16 minutes of scenes cut from the film, including one alternate that was used in the European release but cut for the U.S. release. There are also a couple of screen tests for Ben Cross and Ian Charleson that are interesting --and a nice theatrical trailer.<br/><br/>An interesting side-note is that 20th Century Fox, who financed half of the $6 million budget, was not interested in releasing the film in the U.S. -- they figured Americans would not have an interest in British runners. Ironically, of the films $50 million theatrical gross, $32 million came from the WB domestic release.<br/><br/>Now we finally have a DVD release that is worthy of that is my pick and the finest film of the 1980s. ""Chariots of Fire"" is a film that ranks very high on my list of all-time great films."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","52","75","2 November 2005"," It IS A Big Deal, In More Ways Than One
","I had never seen this movie until the fall of 1997 and after watching 40 minutes wondered, ""What's the big deal?""<br/><br/>Well, the second half of the film and then subsequent viewings have done more than just answer my question.<br/><br/>It's one of the RARE movies in the past 30 years which portrays a Christian in a positive light. Ian Charleson does a convincing job of portraying a 100 percent sincerely good man who walks the talk.<br/><br/>In here is also a good portrayal of a Jewish man, a student at Cambridge, acted well by Ben Cross. This man is too defensive about being Jewish and carries a chip on his shoulder until the end where he comes out a hero and a fine man as well, the bitterness gone.<br/><br/>The story of those two men and their quest for a gold medal at the 1924 Olympics in France makes for an inspiring film. It's also aided by very nice photography and a wonderful score by Vangelis. A recently-issued widescreen DVD finally shows off the award-winning cinematography. The feel- good ending doesn't hurt, either, especially since these main characters were real-life people.<br/><br/>Her extraordinary beauty made Alice Krige an interesting person to watch in the film, and I wonder why she never made it as a ""big-name"" actress. Perhaps that was her decision.<br/><br/>In summary, a very classy film, that still lives up to its reputation."
"phalsall","Null","48","69","16 February 2002"," Sheer Beauty
","I was a student at Edinburgh University in 1981 and was actually lodging with one branch of Eric Liddell's family.<br/><br/>My friends and I all went to see this movie repeatedly -- and I mean five, six, or seven paid entrances. Why?<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think it had anything to do with the plot, character development, the music, or moral virtue. It was simply that the film was so utterly beautiful. <br/><br/>The men were beautiful in a clean, non-glamorous way that we had never seen before. Not in British films, and certainly not in Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>
The social and educational expectations shared by all were beautiful. I know it is fashionable to decry the British class system, and in principle I agree with all the criticisms. But it also seems that erasing class-by-birth leaves little else but crass meritocracy and the sheer vulgarity of the uneducated masses.  Abraham's fellow students at Cambridge and Liddell's at Edinburgh participated in a social and educational system not driven by concerns about jobs, and not pathetically challenged by students who saw themselves as consumers and professors as entertainers.<br/><br/>Britain was beautiful. Of course some parts still are, but Nazi bombs, post-war architecture, and modern cars have destroyed much. This was a Britain where people at the time might have decried ""Victorian"" architecture, but we in 1981 were just coming to realize how great it was. And this was a Britain where, for good or ill, middle class people kept their houses tasteful, and working-class door-steps were white-stoned each week.  <br/><br/>In all this movie was a connection to the beautiful aspects of the British past.  That past might never have existed in reality, but in 1981 we could just about touch it, above all in Edinburgh, spared by German bombs and still one of the most beautiful cities in the world."
"ma-cortes","7","5","5","10 January 2015"," Fascinating drama based on true story of two runners , Eric Liddel and Harold Abraham , including unforgettable score by Vangelis
","This is the story of two men who run to prove something to the world . They will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals , except their honor . Two young men fighting for their objectives , one a determined Jew Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and the other a devout Christian (Ian Charleson) . In a warmup 100 meter race, Scottish Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro coacher (Ian Holm) to prepare him . After that , both compete in the 1924 Olympics where their courage and determination to be tested . Eric Liddell , whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, denies to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee formed by high authorities (Nigel Davenport , Patrick Magee , David Yelland as Prince of Wales) . Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman/athletic advocate, respectively . In fact , during the Japanese occupation of China, Eric as a missionary was taken into the Japanese Weihsien internment Camp, where he was to die from a brain tumour just before the camp was liberated. <br/><br/>This is is a sensitive as well as riveting story, being told in flashback , dealing with two young British sprinters , competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics , both of them compellingly performed by Ben Cross and the early deceased Ian Charleson . About six years after the film's release, Trinity College reenacted the quad dash with British Olympic athletes Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe taking part. <br/><br/>This marvelous film has an all-star-cast such as Ben Cross ,Ian Charleson , Nigel Havers , Ian Holm , Cheryl Campbell and Alice Krige . Great secondary cast formed by prestigious British players and with a number of well known USA and UK performers for the tiny cameo roles such as John Gielgud ,Nigel Davenport , Lindsay Anderson , Patrick Magee , Peter Egan , Richard Griffiths and uncredited Kenneth Branagh as Cambridge student , Stephen Fry and first cinema film of Nicholas Farrell . Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher appeared as a favor to producer David Puttnam, waiving their fees, in order to attract finance from backers who wanted ""marquee names"" . Besides the lead actors, most of the white-clad runners training on West Sands in St. Andrews during the title sequence are St. Andrews golf caddies . <br/><br/>Colorful and evocative cinematography by David Watkin filmed on location in Edinburgh, Scotland, Liverpool , Cambridge University , Eton College, Eton, Berkshire, England . When the athletes are running off the beach , in reality it results to be West Sands at St Andrews in Scotland , they run towards a large red building clearly marked as a hotel ; this is in fact Hamilton hall of residence, a student accommodation hall belonging to the University . <br/><br/>Lavishly and luxuriously produced by great producer David Puttnam , he was looking for a story in the mold of A man for eternity (1966), regarding someone who follows their conscience ; he felt sports provided clear situations in this sense, and happened upon the story by accident while thumbing through an Olympic reference book in a rented house in Los Angeles , then the screenwriter Colin Welland took out advertisements in London newspapers seeking memories of the 1924 Olympics.<br/><br/>Film debut by filmmaker Hugh Hudson , he originally wanted Vangelis' 1977 tune ""L'Enfant"", from his 1979 'Opera Sauvage' album, to be the title theme of the film, and the beach running sequence was actually filmed with ""L'Enfant"" playing in the background for the runners to listen and pace to. Vangelis, however, finally convinced Hudson he could create a new and better piece for the film's main theme - and when he played the new and now-familiar ""Chariots of Fire"" theme for Hudson, it was agreed the new tune was unquestionably better. But the ""L'Enfant"" tune still made it into the film : When the athletes reach Paris and enter the stadium, a brass band marches through the field, and first plays a modified, acoustic performance of ""L'Enfant"" . Vangelis's electronic ""L'Enfant"" track eventually was used prominently in the film The years of living dangerously (1982). The picture deservedly won Academy Awards for Colin Welland's screenplay , Vangelis' magnificent soundtrack , Mila Canonero's costumes and Best picture ."
"bkoganbing","8","5","5","18 July 2009"," Two Men Who Ran
","I'm not sure Chariots Of Fire deserved to be the Best Picture of 1981, I think Reds, Atlantic City, or On Golden Pond deserved that honor. But it's still quite the inspirational story of two men on the British track team of the 1924 Olympics who ran to prove something, but not the same thing.<br/><br/>Ben Cross and Ian Charleson play Harold Abraham and Eric Liddell who are among the survivors of a lost generation to enter college, Cambridge to be precise in 1919, the year after World War I ended. It was called The Great War and the contemplation of another was too horrible to imagine. Cross as Abraham was a veteran of the war, though that fact is curiously downplayed in Chariots Of Fire.<br/><br/>What is emphasized is his Jewish faith. Though Benjamin Disraeli had been Prime Minister and Lord Isaacs as Chief Justice and Sir Herbert Samuel never had to convert as Disraeli did for a political career, the very top of British society was still closed to Jews. I wonder if Ernest Hemingway had known the real Harold Abraham because he could have been a model for Robert Cohn in The Sun Also Rises. Abraham is not obnoxious like Cohn, but has reason for the chip on his shoulder as the Cambridge dons led by John Gielgud confront him about employing a 'professional' trainer. Gielgud could have been some mossback running the NCAA.<br/><br/>Eric Liddell is running for his faith as well. He was not in the war, he was in China with his missionary father. Today he'd be a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, back in the day he typified what was then called 'muscular Christianity', the idea to show that being a Christian was not something for weaklings. <br/><br/>Of course each in his own way makes his point, that in fact is the sum and substance of Chariots Of Fire. With Ian Charleson as Liddell, he makes an issue out of not running in an Olympic event held on the sabbath. I remember back in the day Sandy Koufax refusing to pitch in the World Series game held on Yom Kippur. Of course since the Dodgers also had Don Drysdale and Claude Osteen available at the time that was hardly a detriment. In fact the sabbath dispute over Liddell's views is solved in much the same manner.<br/><br/>Chariots Of Fire is a nice depiction of the United Kingdom during the Twenties. It was not all the jazz age of partying, there were some very serious folk, even young folk at the time. Cross and Charleson play two such.<br/><br/>There might be dispute over whether it was the Best Film of 1981, but the unforgettable musical score there was no doubt about. The awards that Chariots Of Fire won for Costume Design and Original Screenplay were also deserved.<br/><br/>I think the value of Chariots Of Fire is that not only is it an inspirational film, but it takes place during an age when such things were scorned in some quarters. For that reason the film is both a good historical record and of timeless value."

","Perhaps the most moving of all movies that I have ever seen, Chariots of Fire is purely amazing. I must admit that when I first saw it back in '97, I was bored silly by it, but then again, all the movies that I was watching then were your typical fare for a young teen--Adam Sandler comedies (how asinine they are now). Now, I have a great respect for CoF, since I discovered the joy of running and the feel of the race. Before every cross country and track season, I force my teammates to sit down and watch this to help learn what teamwork means and the glory of striving your hardest. Oh and that soundtrack is also pretty good."

Vangelis is a musical genius. The cast is stellar with some new faces of actors and actresses like Alice Krige and even Ruby Wax if you look closely. The 1924 Olympics is the climax of the film. It's still a beautiful and wonderfully entertaining and educational film to be seen. I loved the cast including Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, and the young aspiring Olympic athletes including Brad Davis, Ian Charleson, and Ben Cross. The story is beautifully told in writing and the direction is brilliant to convey the beauty of the story. This is a feel good classic film from 1981."

","We watched it with our children aged 8 to 16. Everybody enjoyed it, but for different reasons. It prompted much discussion about conscience, peer pressure, resistance to authority, and prejudice. A historical note: the Prince of Wales depicted in the movie later became king, only to abdicate his throne to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson. His speech on ""duty"" (to Liddell) is especially ironic given his later actions. Both Abrahams and Liddell are characters with depth. Abrahams struggles with his identity and desire for acceptance, while Liddell struggles with his duty to God. I could relate to both. The pace is a bit slow, but this allows us to digest what we have experienced. There is no violence or sex, despite the PG rating. For Star Trek fans, look for the ""Borg Queen."""
"joseph t","Null","30","43","23 January 2003"," Harold Abrahams...dynamite
","The strength of this movie is the study in character contrast and development, with the added attractions of a historical setting and the soaring, ethereal musical score of Evangelos Papathanassiou.<br/><br/>The film is anchored in the character study of the introspective, brooding, and complex persona of Harold Abrahams, wonderfully portrayed by Ben Cross. Here is a man with all of the outward trappings of success:  academic achievement, unexcelled athletic ability, wildly popular with his peers, yet tortured by an inbred inferiority complex and driven to lash out at the world in response.  In the end, he conquers his inner demons through hard work, sacrifice, understanding of his fellow man, and the love of a good woman, to whom he opens his heart.  I found myself thinking that Harold Abrahams is the kind of man I would want as my best friend, yet at the same time would find hard to become close with and relate to.<br/><br/>Ian Charleston's character (Eric Liddell) is a bit more one-dimensional.  He is the archetypical Good Man, faithful to his family, his country, his friends, and his God.  And in the end he triumphs through sheer force of will and by tapping that reservoir of inner strength that sustains him.  As the crusty coach Sam Mussambini says, ""He's a gut runner.  Digs deep..."".<br/><br/>It's a bit of a pity that the movie, long though it is, could not have delved more deeply into the other characters' background.  Lord Andrew Lindsey is particularly appealing as Harold's and Eric's faithful friend who gives up his spot in his specialty race (the 400 m) to allow Eric a chance at the gold.  Sybil Gordon is wonderful as Harold's love interest who tries to draw him out of his lonely world of bitterness and resentment and self-hatred (""You ran like a God.  I was proud of you..."", even after Harold loses a race for the first time in his life to a more determined Eric). Even some of the American competitors, who are only peripherally portrayed in the concluding segments, lend some color.  Jackson Scholtz' reaching out to Eric Liddell gives one the sense that he knows the greatness of spirit that quietly resides in this unassuming Scotsman.<br/><br/>Its a wonderful story wonderfully told, and when its over you find yourself longing for it to continue, to see how these characters we've come to know over the previous two hours will turn out in the rest of their lives.  Alas, the story of their lives is noted only in subtitles as the film closes."

","I saw this film - an account of British athletes at the Paris Olympics of 1924 - twice when it came out, but i was prompted to watch it again by the holding of the 2012 Olympic Games in my home city of London. The contrast between the movie of the 1926 Games and the television coverage of the 2012 extravaganza showed just how massive the Games have become and yet how the personal factors involved are essentially the same.<br/><br/>""Chariots Of Fire"" opens and closes with the iconic scene of the British bare-foot runners exercising on a beach by the sea as the haunting music of Vangelis soars - a scene borrowed by Mr Bean (aka Rowan Atkinson) for a very funny pastiche at the 2012 Opening Ceremony.<br/><br/>All the characters are real life, even if some of them seem larger than life and there is a degree of artistic licence in the story-telling. The two main ones are Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a sprinter driven by a need to prove himself in a world where being Jewish is still a problem for the English Eastablishment, and Eric Liddell ( Ian Charleston, a deeply religious Scot who refuses to take part in an Olympic heat because it is scheduled for a Sunday (an issue echoed in the 2012 Games which coincided with Ramadan and posed problems for some Muslim athletes). Among a strong support cast, special mention should be made of Ian Holm as the Arab-Italian trainer Sam Mussabini.<br/><br/>It is a wonderfully uplifting story told with style and panache.

","""Chariots of Fire"" is a fine motion picture that won the Best Picture Oscar in 1981, even though it was the longest of long-shots.  The film deals with two young Englishmen (Ben Cross and Ian Charleson) who have hopes of glory at the 1924 Olympics.  We see that their struggles almost cost them the opportunity to achieve the greatness that they both desire.  When they are both ultimately successful, Charleson feels that his win is due to God's glory and accepts the medal with the greatest of pride and admiration. However, after Cross wins the gold he feels somewhat disappointed and realizes that what he thought he wanted was not what he really wanted at all.  The insight into this motion picture is amazing.  Both athletes convey very common feelings that most people experience if they are serious enough in what they are doing, whether it be sports or something else.  The main focus of ""Chariots of Fire"" is that the journey to get to the destination is more important and uplifting than the destination itself.  Many question the fact that this film won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Reds"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  However, this is one time I cannot say anything negative about the Academy's decision.  The fact that this film won in 1981 is testimony to the fact that the Academy is one of the greatest organizations in the world.  Kudos to all involved here.  5 stars out of 5."

","so, this may be a little biased since it is my favorite movie of all time, but...i think this movie is quite excellent.<br/><br/>i first saw it when i was in the eighth grade and it has been my favorite movie ever since. i have a lot of difficulty ever seeing any movie take its place.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is the inspiring true story of two runners, Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary- turned-rugby player-turned sprinter, and Harold Abrahams, an intelligent, dedicated student and son of a Jewish immigrant. Liddell runs for God, Abrahams to fight the anti- Semitism he senses in post-World War I Britain. as these two rivals train for the 1924 Olympics, the audience comes to know their strengths and weaknesses and the people who were important to them in their personal lives.<br/><br/>many people give up on this film within the first fifteen minutes because of the unique storytelling at the beginning. the script is brilliant but hard to follow for those not savvy on British culture or history. the movie, as a whole, was truly made to be seen at least twice, so nuanced is the excellent, Oscar-winning screenplay.<br/><br/>the cast is near perfect, the best performance being Ian Holm's Oscar-nominated and dazzlingly humorous portrayal of trainer Sam Mussabini. Vangelis' Oscar-winning score is now considered clichÃ© and is often-parodied, but when seen in its natural element (the film) completely and beautifully fits. it is a shame so many people only know the main theme of the film when the score contains many absolutely beautiful moments.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is very underrated and unseen by most in my generation. true, it's not a movie for everyone, and i can see why some don't like it. but all things considered, it is, in my opinion, near perfection in the world of cinema."

It has terrific acting, a beautiful simple story, wonderful production values, and of course that score- certainly one of the most beautiful and haunting scores in the history of film.<br/><br/>What it has that is most important, however, is heart.

"happiscotsman","10","9","12","15 March 2002"," A fresh view on sports
","To me, a movie is only as good as the number of times you can watch it, and still feel entertained. Suffice it to say that I have watched ""Chariots of Fire"" many times, and will continue to do so. The film takes us to the most unlikely of places; The 1924 Summer Games, and the focus is on runners from the British team! The central characters of Abrahams and Liddell are well portrayed, but the best performances come from the old pros Sirs Anderson, Holm, and Gielgud. Amongst the other ""Young Turks"" from Cauis College, I favor the performance of Nigel Havers the most.<br/><br/>Many others have mentioned how the richness of the score lifts the film to another level, and I heartily concur. While the story is good, I could not imagine the movie flowing with such a mystical quality if the music had not been there to guide along the scenes. In fact my two favorite scenes have no dialogue at all, but instead just focuses on the actions of the athletes and the music that captures their movement. It almost seems like ballet, with a beat!<br/><br/>Another strong scene is when Abrahams discusses the driving force behind his running with the two college masters. Amateurism is hardly given a thought nowadays, what with the exorbitant salaries that athletes earn in the professional arena. But in 1924, there was still a belief held that the more glorious road was ""the way of the amateur"". You can hear the scorn on Anderson's lips when he says ""You've hired a professional coach, you've adopted a PROFESSIONAL attitude"". This ideology was the accepted stance of most upper-class members of society concerning sports at this time.<br/><br/>
To see this film is to understand the glory and fear that is the Olympics, and how a viewer can appreciate the magic of cinema to bring it before our eyes. A deserving winner of the title, ""Best Picture""."
"Tigereyes","10","5","6","3 October 2007"," One of the most inspirational films ever
","I first saw this film when it came out and recently revisited it, 25 years later. I am awed by the sheer power of its spiritual vision, and its dedicated portrayal of a more innocent age when shallow narcissism took a back seat to honor, friendship, family, and above all, dedication to a higher goal. Although young, handsome, famous, and sometimes egotistical, the athletes are bound not by the desire for money, but by personal commitments to their families, beliefs, and societies. Even the most neurotic runner, Harold Abrahams, is a model of maturity and dignity compared to modern celebrity athletes, and the character of Eric Liddell is beyond inspirational. ""Where does the power come from, to see the race to its end? From within."" Magnificent."
"buzznzipp1995","10","5","6","18 March 2007"," A Powerhouse!! Eric Liddel, is the example
","Back in 1981, when this came out I was not only unaware of the story, but as a kid I was just not interested in viewing this. <br/><br/>My parents took me to the theater with a bunch of Church friends and I sat, and part way through, I remember asking my mom sitting in the next row forward, "" When is the good part coming? "" I was really perturbed, I'm sure I made my mom more so. She was a good sport however and said, just keep watching, be patient. <br/><br/>I sat and waited some more until the final race came. The runners were out and it was full on, everyone showed determination and vigor everyone wanted to 'win' ! The men were sweating and you could see in the slow motion of them in full throttle every muscle in their legs and arms as they moved together. The faces sweating and breathing with that precise air -flow pattern that it takes when you work-out in an extreme method. The story got stronger. Every eye was now on these men as they ran for whatever their desire was for, but all in it were there to get the 'prize'. The music theme song that scored the film, was outstanding and started to grip me as if the power of the example of Eric Liddel had come through to me at my young junior high level. My throat kind of tightened and I recall being in a 'pulling' mode for the main character....a hero of sorts. An athletic Scottsman that had conviction, the kind that changes lives. He was strong in his views and it showed. It wouldn't quite be the same if he had waffled and made excuses, the power of his conviction and moral compass would have become truly 'weak'. <br/><br/>I recognized. (looking back in time) the performances of the actors who, when it comes to the names I can't remember off hand, but they acted convincingly and stood out even to me then as a young man I felt that the direction and the story along with those depicting the real people in the story were amazing.<br/><br/>I recommend this story of inspiration and faith, highly. I only wish to rate it a twenty out of ten. <br/><br/>See it, and be inspired!! (*****)"
"atmvawser","9","5","6","20 February 2003"," A very good film, but not for the impatient or shallow
","It took two viewings before I really got into this film and latched onto its subdued tone and spiritual, poetic style. Although I am not a religious person I always enjoy films with a powerful and positive approach to spirituality, which was as much its subject as running. Like 'Ben-Hur', this film had a similarly persuasive argument in favour of faith. It will not be appreciated by those with a dislike for films about reserved British gentlemen, but for anyone if they pay attention, they will surely appreciate and relate to the determination inherent in the characters of Liddell and especially Abrahams (whose characterisation, and interpretation by Ben Cross, was particularly strong, making him someone who is driven almost by hate). This really is a film from which you will you take away as much as you bring to it. An admittedly unexpected choice for Best Picture, but certainly a worthy one; it's more focused and succinct and less confused than 'Reds', much less sentimental than 'Golden Pond' and about on par with 'Atlantic City' (it's so differnt from 'Raiders' that the two shouldn't even be compared)."

","I am not one for hyperbole, but I viewed this film again last night and it reintroduced me to great film-making. The plot is rapt with a subtlety and nobility rarely found anymore (best example of this: Remains of the Day). It is not so directly about a bunch of guys running (as someone I know so coarsely put it), but rather about the big picture themes of the nature of the human spirit, the inner trappings of ambition, and two individuals internalized struggles against their beliefs and environment. A beautiful story with simply heart-stopping cinematography and an immortal score, Chariots of Fire is near the head of the class in the pantheon of great movies."

","Eric Liddell says that he runs for the glory of God, and when he runs he feels his pleasure.  As Liddell sprints down the field in the last lap of the 400 metres at the Olympic Games what you see in Liddell's face is that joy and so much more.  At the finish line is not only at the end of the race, but a moment in time where he can be one with the God that he puts above everyone and everything, including those he loves best in life.<br/><br/>""It's an ache... a helplessness... and an anger"" This is Harold Abrahams' reaction to the subtle segregation that he is forced to face in Upperclass English Society as a Jew.  To beat Eric Liddell is to prove himself, if not to others, that he is at least the equal of any native Anglo-Saxon Christian Brit.  To break the tape at the Olympic Games and beat the fastest man alive is to be for once admired, respected, and accepted by a Society that has only tolerated his presence.  The drive for this acceptance is something that he puts above everyone and everything, including those he loves best in life.    <br/><br/>Each man has a goal, an aim, an objective and each works hard to reach it. As different as they are it is the drive that they share in common, and the need to have their deepest held desires achieved.  At the end    of the finish line where Eric Liddell is embraced by his God, Harold Abrahams is embraced by his British peers.  <br/><br/>To muddy the waters of these men's personal stories by looking for larger, philosophical themes is a crime.

","The problem with this movie is simple: it is based on a true story. Or more accurately, two true stories, that happened to occur at the same time, and end up in the same place. The problem is, this is a case where fiction would have been better than truth, because the true stories are, shall we say, slim. There's not much story to the story. This is why so many people found it boring, because not very much happens, over a pretty long period of time. I didn't find it boring, I found it disappointing. Disappointing, because I was waiting with interest for the two stories to converge, climax and resolve, to see the chip-on-his-shoulder Jew finally get his rematch against the missionary Christian. But in fact, there's absolutely NO resolution (presumably because there was no resolution in real life). In the end, the early play-up of the Jewish guy's Jewishness went nowhere and amounted to nothing. The big deal about him losing the early race to the missionary guy went nowhere and amounted to nothing. In the end, the whole movie pretty much went nowhere and amounted to nothing.<br/><br/>I normally rail at movie-makers playing fast and loose with historic fact, so I'm not suggesting they should have altered history to make a more compelling story. I just think this wasn't an interesting enough story to make a movie out of in the first place."

And THEN gets the Best Picture (and several other) Academy Awards, as well?  Legendary actress Lilian Gish said it was the best movie ever made -- and who should know films better than the silent star who had witnessed the ENTIRE history of film up 'til then from the inside?<br/><br/>I remember, I first went to see Chariots of Fire for one reason -- I was one of only 3 known Vangelis fans in the Western Hemisphere in 1981, and this was now the first musical score he had composed and performed for a movie. Those Brits and Scots all looked alike and the accents made me wish for subtitles.  AND I had missed the first 15 minutes, out getting popcorn for my girlfriend.  So I HAD to go back a 2nd time to try and figure out what was happening (and to hear the music again).  And then a 3rd, and 4th, and eventually a 12th (yes, in the theater!) time, because this movie gripped me -- and my best friends -- in a way we'd never experienced.<br/><br/>The uncomplicated mind will see a good story of 2 track athletes in their 20s in the 1920s, in the ultimate contest, the Olympics.  Those who like character psychology will appreciate the heroes' struggle to find their identities and purposes in life.  The spiritual viewer will find cinematic soulmates.  Those who strive (or want to strive) for greater purposes will find inspiration.  Observers of culture will find that ""British humor"" isn't ALWAYS an oxymoron.  There are trials, growth, stress, neuroses, honor, vanity, painful decisions, wrenching defeats, and the triumph of the soul. Music-lovers will love the helping of Gilbert and Sullivan, not to mention the stirring and majestic (and Oscar-winning) Vangelis score.  This film has heart and soul and warmth and nobility.

","""Chariots of Fire"" is today remembered for three things: 1) its pretentious title, 2) its opening credits of young British men running barefoot in the surf scored to Vangelis' famous synth theme, and 3) being one of the Academy Awards biggest misfires as to a Best Picture winner. How this ponderous and plodding film won over Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" will puzzle film fans for generations to come.<br/><br/>The plot: in post World War I Britain two young men from different backgrounds pursue an opportunity to compete as runners at the 1924 Paris Summer Olympics. One is a wealthy, Cambridge student who runs out of anger at a world he feels does not truly accept him due to his being Jewish and thus it's a world that he constantly wants to best. The other is a devout Presbyterian Scot whose life's work will be as a missionary and believes that God reflects his joy in him by giving him the ability to run really, really fast.<br/><br/>There is no question that ""Chariots of Fire"" is well-acted and decently filmed, but there really isn't much of a story here. There's almost no conflict or tension. The two main characters rarely interact with each other. It's as if they each have their own little film. In the Olympics, they don't even compete against one another. The film's ""villains"" are some stuffy Cambridge deans and the big, bad American Olympic team. However, it's clear from the start that the two main characters are also world class athletes. They're not exactly underdogs.<br/><br/>What we get is that two great athletes ran in the 1924 Olympics for different personal reasons. So? Couldn't we make a movie about almost any other Olympic athletes? What made these two any more special or unique? One didn't want to run on the Sabbath? That's interesting, but it's not exactly the stuff of 130 minute movies. Sadly, a lot of ""Chariots of Fire"" feels like sluggish padding."

Harold Abrahams, is a Jewish Englishman who wants desperately to be accepted and prove to the world that Jews are not inferior. The film crosscuts between each man's life as he trains for the competition, fueled by these very different desires. As compelling as the racing scenes are, it's really the depth of the two main characters that touches the viewer, as they forcefully drive home the theme that victory attained through devotion, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice is the most admirable feat that one can achieve.<br/><br/>The film manages to make effectively stirring use of its spiritual and patriotic themes.Like every element in this picture, the actors look right and they excel in their great performances.And to fully appreciate it,one does not have to a deep appreciation of sports but merely an understanding of human nature.And although this it has been released more than 30 years ago,it has proved time and again that this is a timeless story."

But in fact this is a titanic movie which simply exceeds the sum of its parts. Charleson plays Eric Liddell, a Scots runner who must choose between his belief in keeping the Sabbath holy and his desire for Olympic success. Cross plays Harold Abrahams, a Jewish competitor who has to decide whether to use a professional coach despite the misgivings of his prestigious university. Still doesn't sound like much? Then you just have to see the movie. As with all great movies, the moral dilemmas are presented without judgment and you get to decide. Plus the presentation is as important as the message, the feel of the 1920's permeates this movie. A very deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, far better than the ratings given it by IMDb visitors."

","I saw this movie only once when it first came out, but it has stayed fresh in my mind all these 25 years and I'm sure I'd glean even more out of it the second time around. It's an absolute must see, a film with compelling characters and a unique theme I've encountered nowhere else. <br/><br/>The film is based, apart from a few historical liberties, on two runners who compete in the 1924 Paris Olympics. It's primarily a character study of the two track athletes and their very different but equally passionate motivations, both being consumed with a fire for running and competition. Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary, runs because he believes it pleases and glorifies God. Failure to do so, he feels, would be 'to hold Him in contempt'. Harold Abrahams is Jewish and his motivations revolve around overcoming the prejudice of that era in Cambridge society. He must 'prove himself' and vying for an Olympic medal is simply the vehicle he chooses for that end. Ian Charleson and Ben Cross are both brilliant in their respective roles of Liddell and Abrahams.<br/><br/>The plot itself holds a certain interest (if not grip) as we watch the two athletes train, head to Paris, and eventually compete in their respective track events. Obviously, unless you're already an expert on former Olympic medalists, you're going to wonder...did they win their races? However, that being said, the film is definitely more driven by character than by plot.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few deviations from true history here, but regarding the Sabbath issue, I find it moving and inspiring in this day and age to think of an athlete of that calibre taking such a stand. Not to broadly denounce all modern Olympians who devote their lives to training, but oh...that we had such personal integrity in our era, with steroid scandals (so commonplace as to not even be scandalous anymore) and focus on future professional careers and lucrative product sponsorships.<br/><br/>The Vangelis theme accompanying the slow motion runners at the beach became justifiably famous. I'm not much of an athlete to say the least but whenever I hear it to this day, it makes me feel like running! <br/><br/>Don't miss this movie. Cinematography, music, a touch of race suspense, but especially character and theme...all brilliantly done."

","This is a movie that fascinates me for a variety of reasons:  the Edwardian attitudes in a time of moral upheaval (post-WWI), the contrast between a ""muscular Christian"" and a man running to beat the anti-Semitic bias of his time, etc.  Because the movie asserted that it is ""A True Story"" I figured it would be fun to find out more about the various characters.  What a disillusionment.  The more I was able to find out the facts, the more the central conflicts in the movie fell apart.  Harold Abrahams, while he did hire a professional trainer, was considered one of the most popular students at university and, if he was snubbed, it didn't bother him much.  He certainly wasn't motivated to run by any anti-Semitism he encountered.  He didn't meet He didn't meet Sybil Gordon until after his career was ended by a broken leg while demonstrating the long jump for reporters.  His good friend and roommate, Aubrey Montague, turned out to be a rival runner at Oxford, who once wrote his mother after losing to Abrahams that he hoped Abrahams' Cambridge teamates, who had triumphantly carried him off the field, would drop him and break his leg.  (The two became friends later in life, when they served together in amateur athletic organizations.) Abrahams was not the first runner to beat the school clock chimes; that was done by a brash aristocratic sprinter whose personality resembles the entirely fictional Lord Lindsay in the movie.<br/><br/>Eric Lidell was aware months before the team left for Paris   that heat was scheduled for a Sunday and was always slated to run in the 400 -- no last minute switch to avoid running on the Sabbath.  (Something like what was depicted did happen in the 1912 Olympics, but the runners were Americans from Penn, if I recall correctly.)  Jennie Lidell never discourage Eric from training for Olympics.  Jackson Scholz barely met Eric Lidell and never gave him an encouraging note.  (I talked to Scholz by phone before he died at his home in Del Ray Beach and he told me that if he had given Lidell a note it wouldn't have been a  biblical quotation because ""my religious training was, well, a little casual."")<br/><br/>Scholz and Jennie Lidell, who were listed as technical advisers to the movie, were both more than a little offended by the inaccuracies in the movie and Scholz refused to see it because he felt it portrayed the Americans as overbearing and egotistical; he said that, in reality, ""you couldn't have wanted to meet a bunch of nicer guys.""<br/><br/>Does it matter? Probably not, but if it doesn't, why pretend the movie is true?  Why not ""based on actual events,"" or something of that sort?  It really takes something away from the movie when you realize that none of the main characters had any of the  personal, social or religious motivations the movie relies on to create drama.  It makes one wonder what really motivated the real characters.  I wrote and called Colin Welland a few times, but he never responded.<br/><br/>I still enjoy the movie, but now it's about a bunch of fictional characters, about whom it's harder to feel much interest.  Sort as if one learned that Becket was, in fact, not killed by Henry II's barons, but was merely mugged in the park.  Somehow the movie wouldn't be the same afterwards.<br/><br/>I wonder what kind of a movie could have been made about the real characters and events of the 1924 Olympics?"

","A young English runner is reviled by The Establishment because he hires a professional trainer.  The Establishment feels that this is setting a dangerous precedent.  Too many more concessions like this, they think, and the amateur spirit will be lost.<br/><br/>They're absolutely right.  Look at the Olympics nowadays: a hive of corruption and even the ping pong players are in it for the money. Moreover the athletes - ESPECIALLY in sports like running - have been trained to the eyeballs to the point where they become specialised machines who consult both coach and sponsor before deciding what shoes to wear.  Good on the aristocrats who used to run the games.  If only they'd held out longer.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm straying a little from the point.  I suppose the point is this. When you see a group of runners lined up at the start of a race, the positions is symmetrical.  A win for one is a loss for everyone else. Exactly one person will win, whatever happens - so why should we want one person in particular to win?  We need some fact to break the symmetry: this athlete has overcome overwhelming odds; that athlete is the only one who isn't cheating; this other athlete is such a nice chap.  So what are we given in ""Chariots of Fire""?  An athlete who is trying to steal a march on his competitors by starting a training arms race, and another athlete who has changed events because he has a superstition about the day of the week on which he's been scheduled.  I tempts me to root for one of the unknowns.<br/><br/>This doesn't matter if the film is well enough staged.  And sure enough, people tell me it's been filmed in such an inspiring way.  Maybe they're right.  I don't see it myself.  I know I've seen races that have made my pulse quicken much more - quite apart from the fact that I was offered little reason to want the two stars to win, in the first place."
"johnb-62","10","5","7","27 September 2005"," A Timeless Source of Inspiration to the Athlete, but a number of Inaccuracies
","My comments will be of most interest to track & field enthusiasts. I agree with much of what has been written. The movie is gripping, brilliantly conceived and nearly flawlessly executed. It is a movie which I can watch a couple of times a year and get inspiration from.<br/><br/>As a lifetime track & field competitor, and currently a 'masters' decathlon competitor, I was fascinated by the historical accuracy of the movie. The movie industry virtually always makes changes for dramatic effect. The Buddy Holly Story - another one of my favorites - is filled with them, though they don't really spoil the positive effect of paying a tribute to his music.<br/><br/>In this case, as another reviewer has mentioned, the inaccuracies don't detract too much. However they are worth recounting. These are the ones I am aware of.<br/><br/>First, the characters of Lindsay and Montague - two compelling figures in the movie - appear to be entirely fictitious. The movie shows Lindsay getting a silver medal in the 400M intermediate hurdles, then gallantly stepping aside to let Eric Liddell run the 400M. No British runner won a medal in the 400 meter hurdles. In addition, the 100 meters is traditionally one of the first track & field finals in the Olympics. am not sure about this, but my guess is that this was true in 1924 as well, meaning that the 400 meter hurdles would have been later in the meet. My suspicion is that the reason for Montague and Lindsay appearing live in the opening scene at the church is so they don't have to account for their life stories in the closing tableau, which mentions the fate of both Abraham and Liddell.<br/><br/>Second, as others noted, Liddell knew months in advance of the Sunday 100M heats. He did forgo the race for the reasons mentioned and it did cause a furor in England. But the whole aspect of the pressured meeting in Paris was totally fictitious. Something NOT noted in the movie - and in my mind an amazing aspect of Liddell's accomplishment - is that he not only won the 400M by 5 yards - a race not his specialty - but also set a world record of 47.4 in the process. I don't know why this wasn't somehow worked into the movie - it would have made it more powerful than it already is, inmy opinion. <br/><br/>Third, the entire Abraham v. Liddell rivalry is likely exaggerated, at the least. There is NO record of their ever competing against each other before the Olympics - as was portrayed in the movie - with the scene of Harold being comforted by his girlfriend-someday-to-be-wife in the stands afterwards.<br/><br/>Fourth, the movie gives the impression that Liddell and Abrahams never squared off in the Olympics, leaving unsettled who was the better runner. In fact they both entered the 200 meters, with Liddell finishing 6th and Abrahams not making the final. Takes a little of the gloss off the accomplishments, which is why it was probably not mentioned.<br/><br/>Fifth, no mention is made of the fact that Abrahams had actually competed in the 1920 Olympics - in multiple events - not placing in any of them. The scene where Sam Mussabini is schooling Abraham about the 1920 Olympics makes no sense - Abraham was at that Olympics - he just didn't place. <br/><br/>Sixth, the movie shows Abraham losing out to Jackson Schultz in the semi-final of the 100 meters, by looking to the side. Abrahams actually dominated the 100 meter event - in the heats, quarterfinals and semifinals before winning the final. In fact, it was theorized that he might have expended himself unnecessarily out of anxiety and insecurity, risking losing the finals. But he also won the final, though not by a large margin. <br/><br/>Seventh, and I am not sure about this - the 200 meters is usually AFTEr the 100 meters, so Abrahams comment to Sam Mussabini about losing in the 200 meters would have been fictitious.<br/><br/>Eighth, Jackson Schultz has said he never gave Liddell a note about honoring God. In fact, it is hard for me to imagine that an athlete not in an event would have access to runners before an event final like that. This also applies to the scene where the British High Command are meeting the 100 meter finalists right before their race - no way that would have ever happened. <br/><br/>That having been said, the movie was still phenomenal - and I love it and always will. The soundtrack alone qualifies it for a special place in movie history.<br/><br/>Some other points of interest. Sam Mussabini was a very real character, and he was hired by Abraham as a professional. The race in which Liddell fell and got up and won is also based on a true event.<br/><br/>I hope my breakdown of these points is not mis-interpreted. The movie is the greatest portrayal ever of the great sport of track & field on film - and so well done that it told it's essentially true story in such a powerful way that it has been seen by millions, possibly even tens of millions, worldwide."

","I have grown up with Chariots of Fire, and have enjoyed it each time I watch it. Granted, it is not a movie that everyone will love; my roommates still don't<br/><br/>understand what I see in it. I didn't even fall in love with it the first time I watched it. However, over the years Chariots of Fire and its simple message of<br/><br/>perseverance and faith have stuck with me longer than the many films with<br/><br/>blazing special effects and flashy stars. <br/><br/>As noted by other reviewers, Chariots of Fire includes a cast of relatively<br/><br/>unknown actors (with the exception of Sir John Gielgud). However, it is not fair to say that no one in the film went on to do any note worthy films afterwards. Ian Charleson (Eric Liddel) has the best excuse - he passed away a few years after the film was made. Ian Holm has gone on to do many other respectable films,<br/><br/>such as Lord of the Rings (Bilbo Baggins). Despite other films that the actors did (or didn't do) after Chariots of Fire, the general performance throughout the film is believable and moving.<br/><br/>I would recommend Chariots of Fire for those who want a break from the movies with roaring action, but little plot. It is a quiet film based on a true story, but one that will stay with you long after you've returned the DVD."

That theme music by Vangelis is soul-stirring, and being familiar with the music before I entered the theater, I expected a story every bit as thrilling.  But what I got was a lot of running, a glut of pained expressions, and a religious, won't-work-on-the-Sabbath prig, who didn't bother to check the calendar before leading his countrymen to believe he'd represent them in the Olympics.  Great painters, poets, playwrights, inventors, mathematicians, teachers, (I could go on) leave the world a better place for their having been among us.  Great runners leave us with records that get broken.  The guys in this movie ran fast for their day and thought very highly of themselves, but they weren't the great heroes they were purported to be.

","I saw ""Chariots of Fire"" just after it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. This viewing was in a big-screen theater, the way movies should be judged. All the Oscar hype was fresh in the minds of the public when we decided to check it out. I should have known something was wrong when we walked into the theater and most of the seats were empty. But we had paid our money, and decided to see what the movie was like. Is there one word that can describe dreary deadly dull movies? One reviewer said that watching grass grow was more exciting. He gave you a good analogy and he was certainly correct. Watching paint dry would be immensely fun compared to watching this drivel. This movie easily fits into a category of top 10 worst movies of all time. My one-word description would be glacial. The movie stars Ben Cross who has had the sort of career you can best describe as unnoticed. As I am writing this review, one of his more recent dreary films, a D-grade flick called ""Wicked Little Things"" is playing in the background and was the trigger that inspired me to look up the old ""Chariots of Fire"" film, and to see the path of Cross's career. IMDb reviews are wonderful because they allow freedom of expression about films, but there is a disturbing tendency among reviewers to be sheep-like in their descriptions. If a film is perceived as good, because it wins some awards, then almost everyone who chooses to write about it will follow the leader. Similarly, movies that are perceived as bad, such as the many made-for-TV movies produced by the Sci-Fi channel, will be described as trash. In the reviews, it is astounding to me that anyone could describe ""Chariots of Fire"" as anything other than what it is: boring and deadly dull. Going back to my first viewing, everyone who was in that theater the night we saw it got up and left before it was over. After two of the most interminable hours of my life, the theater was empty except for us. We were determined to see it to the end, and we did, but I have never been so grateful as I was that night when the closing credits finally scrolled across the screen. Can I recommend this film to anyone? Not if entertainment is your goal. As one other reviewer said, perhaps if you are an insomniac and in need of a sleep-aid, you might want to consider it. Remember, I did give it a one-word description: glacial."

","""Chariots of Fire"" has usually been regarded as showing human spirit and matters of overcoming obstacles. Maybe it was intended as such, but it doesn't come out that way: it ends up being a grandiose glorification of England. We hear about how someone ""...fought and died for the English way."" The English way?! Wasn't that colonialism? <br/><br/>The actual story involves some college students in 1920's England who want to race in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Among the characters are Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish student who has to face anti-Semitism, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a Scottish Presbyterian who won't run on the Sabbath. Honestly, why must these things always come up in sports movies? <br/><br/>That said, the movie wasn't a total waste. The theme song, which you've surely heard, has often been used in movies, best of all in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". But overall, the high point in this movie is when some cockneys look scornfully at the rich students and say: ""We fought (in WWI) so that they could get an education."" Otherwise, ""Chariots of Fire"" is downright awful."
"zaisjr","2","16","31","15 February 2010"," Is it because I'm not British that I think this movie was awful?
","With the Olympics going on, I decided to have my girlfriend and I watch this classic. I am someone who loves true story movies, loves old classic movies, and loves movies that build their characters over time.<br/><br/>But this movie, in our opinion, lacked plot structure, a point, any sort of climatic instance, any drive, and any real love for the characters.<br/><br/>For those of you who plan to see this movie, this is a summary of what we saw. The two main characters are Eric Liddel and Harold Abrahams. They both are honorable characters (honor being the only point of the story) who both love to run and are quite good at it. Both want to be in the Olympics. For most of the movie you hear about how Liddel is a great runner. Every ten minutes you will see him run a race, races which are usually pointless. Between each race scene there is about ten minutes of British banter and young British men running around in their polo shirts and scarves talking about politics and the weather. Throughout the whole movie, you see Abrahams on the sidelines. He hardly ever races. He just sits around flirting with some actress or talking about running.... but not doing any of it. It's apparent that he wants to prove that he's better than Liddel, which gives some tension to the movie. However, they never race aside from the beginning of the movie. The movie ends with him racing without Liddel in the Olympics because Liddel is a Jew and won't run on the Sabbath (honorable and understood). Liddel wins other races without Abrahams.<br/><br/>There's nothing I can tell you about these characters other than that the two main characters are honorable men who like to race. Their love interests were hardly seen nor talked about. Abrahams girlfriend just popped up now and then for a kiss and that was about it. There was no point to the love relationships. I didn't identify nor really see any reason to care about the main characters. The movie spent so much time talking about nothing and, in the end, amounting to nothing.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I finally saw the movie almost 30 years after it's release. But as I stated earlier, my girlfriend and I both love classic movies. We aren't the sort of people who really like Michael Bay films or any other films that rely on special effects, sex, and violence. This movie was done with taste, but incredibly boring taste. I saw more plot structure in an insurance seminar than in this movie."

","I think this is a good movie, but I can't tell. I was too bored to care. I came into the movie with semi-high expectations since I had gone on a blitz of watching Best Picture winners that I hadn't seen before (Patton, The Last Emperor, Kramer Vs Kramer and The Apartment) I was truly disappointed by this and wonder why it got the thumbs up over ""Reds"".<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the directing seems to be impassioned by the material it is presenting and there is an over emphasis on slow motion photography and echoed voices to be used as dramatic effect. In addition, I didn't really care about many, or a bit more accurately, any of the characters since they were all already pampered ivy-league kids.<br/><br/>The only guy I liked was Ian Holms character, the trainer of the Jewish athlete. He seemed to have his feet on the ground with a solid head on his shoulders. Also, I think they used religion to get on the good side of the public due to the fact that it oozes out of every pore of this movie's soggy skin. I'm not against religion in movies, but I think the purpose of the scriptwriter was not wholesome.<br/><br/>And just to make matters a bit worse, the movie insults my intelligence by repeating dialogue the characters have already said (used as narrative during a climatic or in order to ""remind"" me of the motivation of character. The only time this method of usage of past material used as a narrative to ""remind"" the audience is acceptable are mystery movies where the plot may become so convoluted you miss details along the way. This just seemed trite and lazy.<br/><br/>The last detail that bothered me was the use of electronic music as the film's score. I know that little ditty they play is famous but I don't think that it was appropriate due to the time the movie took place. Because of this, I was constantly reminded that the movie was made in the eighties when there was a blitz of such music out (think of 80's rock) but the fact that this movie took place in the 1920's I was constantly dragged out of the time (even though the costumes were well done). If the electric guitar hadn't been invented yet, why would you use a synthesizer?<br/><br/>Anyways, watch it if you want but I don't suggest it. The Academy just gave a conservative movie a title it didn't earn because ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" was too much fun and ""Reds"" was too controversial. Even ""On Golden Pond"" was better than this dribble. Think back to when ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat out ""The Fellowship Of The Rings"" or when ""The English Patient"" beat ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>This is a boring and thankfully forgotten movie. It's the type of movie you would dread to watch if you were forced to sit through it in school.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

","I can understand why athletes and very religious people might be into this movie, but personally it didn't do anything for me.  <br/><br/>The portrayal of prejudice against Abrahams was interesting, and probably the best part of the movie (and I'm not even Jewish).  However, the religious themes were preachy and heavy-handed at best.  The overall motif of doing what you feel is right versus doing what you and others would like you to do has been dealt with in much more compelling ways in much more interesting movies.  <br/><br/>My big beef with this movie is it's lack of focus.  It's basically two movies--one about Abrahams and one about Liddell.  One keeps expecting them to come together, but even up to the end, they really don't.  Yes, they both go to the same Olympics.  However, they don't race together, they don't converse.  They're both just... there.  The fatal problem hence is the lack of a coherent, fluid plot.  It basically bounces all around two under-developed subplots.  There's no real focus and no closure for either. <br/><br/>
The acting for the most part was fair.  The costumes and sets were aesthetically pleasing, but nothing outstanding.  The score is good if you can keep from giggling about the melodramatic use of early-1980s synthesizers.  Perhaps the technical aspects of the film were fabulous 20 years ago, but by today's standards, it's nothing special (which I suppose is to be expected).<br/><br/>All in all, unless you're really big into running or athletics, save your energy for a movie that's actually entertaining."

","After all these years the opening sequence of ""Chariots of fire"" is still one of the most memorable in the history of movies. A celebration of life and youth, the ""simple"" pleasure of being alive and running barefoot on the beach and the wonderful soundtrack enhancing the moment.<br/><br/>The plot is about Abrahams and Liddell, two very different English athletes who competed in the 1924 Paris Olympic games.<br/><br/>Abrahams is a Jew and a bit of a whiner. Allegedly ""discriminated"" because of his religion, Abrahams is rich, studying at one of the most exclusive universities of the country and on the verge of Olympic immortality. Hardly heavy burdens to bear. Liddell is a Scottish missionary, born in China and ready to go back but not before competing in Paris.<br/><br/>Not being into sports, I found the film well-made, but slightly too long. Abrahams love story fills uselessly some screen time. It could have been avoided, without damaging the main plot in any way.<br/><br/>Also, for non-English audience, the patriotic pride is a tad overbearing. It is a fine movie, but the big winner is the music, hardly ever used to best effect.

Chariots Of Fire was quite a pleasant surprise, though one still held back by fundamental flaws. It's pretty hard to try and raise the stakes for this in a meaningful way and it tries in the form of religion, but to a contemporary secular society it's hard to connect to or have faith in. Other than its religious themes, its biggest personality is how it's unbearably British. I can see where all the clichÃ©s perpetuated in cartoons come from now, it's all our fault. Otherwise a lot of the film's shortcomings isn't necessarily its fault, just the way film history turned out.<br/><br/>There may not be a familiar face outside of Ian Holm to latch onto but the performances are still impressive at least for their running. Vangelis' score is now more associated with the dystopian vistas of Blade Runner so some moments are hard to take seriously, but some still retain the magic, especially with its unassuming but pleasing golden brown cinematography and keen editing tricks borrowed from the 70s with slow motion and subjective flashbacks. Even ignoring its attempts at religious meaning and its character development which are hit- and-miss beside some heartbreaking talks with the otherwise extraneous love interests, it's still an entertaining rivalry movie. Chariots Of Fire is an underrated and solid best picture winner from the 1980s, if nothing remarkable, but 1981 was a weak year outside of Das Boot anyway.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Chariots of Fire is a film which has been well recognized for the scene during the opening credits, where a group of athletes run through the surf on a beach in England.  This scene has been repeatedly imitated and parodied in many other films and television sitcoms.  The movie gives us a true story which will surely evoke deep emotions amongst many who attentively watch it.<br/><br/>We see these young men on the beach as from an era long past -- 1924 to be exact.   The film follows several members of the British Olympic track team which went to Paris to compete against their heavily favored American counterparts. Yet this movie is not focused necessarily on the simple matter of who can run the fastest distance between two lines, rather the motivations which drive some to run.<br/><br/>In character Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), we see a man who runs not necessarily for pleasure or accolades, but to establish his own sense of human dignity.   The son of a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, Abrahams was well aware of the often subtle, but prevalent anti-Semitism in society.<br/><br/>Actor Ian Charleson portrayed the other primary subject of the film, Scotsman Eric Liddell.  As a member of a devout Calvinist ministerial family, he views his committment to spreading the word of God as being of utmost importance.<br/><br/>The running scenes are beautiful in this film.  In training sequences we see Abrahams being mercilessly drilled by Coach Sam Mussibini (Ian Holm), whom he hired to 'make him faster'.  Every inch, every step of his routine is scrutinized and enhanced. Slow-motion is used effectively in this film, focusing on facial reactions in moments of apprehension, effort, dismay, victory and despair.<br/><br/>Finally, the score composed by Vangelis for this film is a remarkable one- up there with other rare gems such as 'The Third Man'.

A lovingly made look at the lives of two great British sportsmen building up to the Olympics and a stab at the greatest glory a track athlete can achieve, this is awash with period flavour, rich in wonderful acting (sadly neither of the two leads repeated their on-screen glory moment, Ian Charleson's early death being particularly tragic), and featuring that unforgettable Vangelis score, this will always be a great film to me and continues to inspire. Despite some of the highlights provoking a ""Ooooh, here comes the bit where he falls over and gets up again..."" in anticipation, it still has such a richness that some scenes and lines can still evoke new feelings, inspire new thoughts and connections. Fantastic."
"Caledonia Twin #1","10","2","2","31 January 2001"," A competition of wills, not merely one between men
","""Chariots of Fire"", a story primarily revolving around the lives of two men: Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, was to my mind, thoroughly engrossing from start to finish.  Perhaps because it is a film which shows a great understanding of human nature and the psychology of competition between two men.  Yet each man struggles with something greater than the mere running of a race.  Liddell is hard pressed to maintain his integrity and faith under duress.  A devout Scottish protestant, he must choose between racing on a Sunday or not, and thereby show or deny his sense of allegiance to God, though it would be so tempting to rationalize that running the race at the Olympics would actually be fulfilling his duty to King and country.  At the same time, Abrahams struggles with his own perfectionism, his own discontent within himself, his own driving ambition to win above all else, and to deal with the agony of defeat.  Add some fantastic music, painstakingly realistic examples of cinematography, a few nail-biting cliff hangers, the sting of unjust racial prejudices at work, and more than a little foul play, and you have yourself a winner here.  I absolutely love this film, though I would not say it is for everyone.  My rating: 10/10."
"theatronsrb","10","2","2","3 January 2000"," Beautifully filmed and acted
","Chariots of Fire, far from being soporific, is a beautifully filmed story of runners bound for Olympic Glory at the 1924 Paris Olympiad. Based on real events, Chariots of Fire creates the mood and feeling of post-war Europe excellently. War-scarred men carry the heavy bags for the college boys attending Oxford on whose commissary wall are listed the names of the many dead who once walked those hallowed halls. The two principal characters are Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross), a Jewish man who loves his home country, England, even though he is treated as a second class citizen due to his heritage and Eric Liddell (played by Ian Charleson), a Christian who must face the decision of honoring his religious commitments or running for the gold medal. The movie is compelling by showing how victory means different things to different people. Harold wants to prove something, Eric feels that ""God has made him fast,"" others compete because they have nothing better to do and others compete for the sheer thrill of it. Chariots of Fire explains the passion, sacrifice and excitement behind the names listed in the record books."
"yrosi","10","2","2","7 May 1999"," I'm crazy about this film
","This movie is my very favorite.  It only improves with viewing.  The story seems simple: nearly everyone thinks it's a movie about running.  But there's so much more to it than that.  For every character in the movie, running accomplishes some goal.  Yet each character approaches running in a different way.  Eric Liddell, one of the two main characters, runs for God. 'When I run, I feel His pleasure,' he says, and as he runs, the viewer gets caught up in this belief.  I am not a religious person, but watching Eric run, I too feel pleasure.  Emotion swells up as he runs around the track. And how could it not, with Vangelis' brilliant soundtrack playing in the background? For Harold Abrahams, the other main character, running also has to do with religion, but Harold runs not to become closer to God but to combat the anti-Semitism he feels wherever he goes.  Harold is Jewish, and he runs to show the world that he can outrun anyone else. Great as the racing and training scenes are, what makes this movie memorable are the little touches.  Each character is a little miracle unto himself.  There are no weak links in the chain.  Watch this movie once, then watch it again.  Every time you see it, you notice some new nuance, something new to love.  This is no action movie suited for large group viewing; it deserves absolute attention.  Enjoy."

","I have seen this film countless times and every time I do I fall more in love with it. Besides the wonderful story line paralleling Harold Abraham and Eric Liddel's lives, the way the competition is portrayed between the two athletes is what gets me the most. Being an ex-track runner, I can somewhat relate to the way they feel walking up to the starting line, the pressure and the nervousness, and the wanting to win. Vangelis' score is phenomenal, and I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes really good movies."

I remember how refreshingly different it seemed in 1981, old-fashioned but in a lovely sort of way, and actually inspiring!  It was and is a rare thing in movies to see faith treated with respect and admiration.  This movie does so.  The period detail and recreation was meticulous and loving.  The fact that it was largely performed by unknowns made their performances carry all the more impact, and I was especially captivated by Ian Charleson and the lovely Alice Krige.  It mystifies me how some people seem to despise a film I found enthralling - intelligent, uplifting and altogether exceptional!"

With that being said....I sat on my front lawn yesterday and watched my grass grow for a few moments and I found that more fascinating and entertaining than this movie. I feel for those that are discriminated against and I think that it is a tragedy that people suffer as they do for the color of their skin or the type of religion they choose to worship. However, that does not excuse this movie. I have made a real effort not once, but twice to watch this movie and I have to admit I have yet to see the whole thing! I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless they were suffering from insomnia. This movie would put even the worst insomniac to sleep in no time!

","Lets face it, the only great thing about this film is it's wonderful score. Can a movie win best picture because of its score?  I believe that is exactly what this movie did.  Because the entire rest of the film, with the exception to the wonderful music, IS BORING.  Dull acting, dull dialogue, dull everything.  The races are in slow motion, but the script is in slow motion as well.  The characters are not very interesting, and frankly a biography of some sort would have been more interesting then this soap opera."
"fightingamish00","3","13","26","27 July 2004"," Not worthy of its awards won
","This movie is a long, overrated drawn out picture that could have been summed up in about 30 mins as an ESPN sports Century special. Oh GOD, is this movie long and drawn out. By the end of the movie, I was so happy it was over, that I didn't care what had happened. I was just glad to hear that great theme song, which is the only thing that is great about the movie. It's a good movie at best and I would only recommend this to people who feel the need to see some of Oscars worst picks. <br/><br/>I believe this is based on a true story about the 1924 British Olympic Team that apparently was an underdog story. The movie is sooooo uninspiring though, that I really don't care to look up anything about the factual story. The plot is slow, confusing and most of all BORING!!! I could see where it was trying to show the struggles of the athletes and their conflicts, but the acting was so poor for a movie of this stature, that it just hurt to watch for 2 verrrrrry long hours. One thing I was inspired to look up was the filmography of the unknown main actors in this movie and to no surprise are the lists unimpressive. I was not shocked to see that any of the top 4 actors listed have done nothing before or since the movie came out in 1981 and Chariots of Fire is the only recognizably impressive thing on all their lists. The beginning of the movie is confusing and sorting out the characters is more of a challenge than the one the athlete's go through in the movie. The plot and story continue to be uninspiring and the great moments which are far and few between are missed b/c of how drawn out things are to get to them. <br/><br/>The only great aspect of this movie is the theme song and it is not played enough to save the movie. But here's something strange: We have a movie set in the 20's with music that has synthesizers from the 80's. Throughout the movie, I'm thinking, ""This was set in the 20's right?"" So even though the music is great, it really sticks out like a very sore thumb when you hear it in a TWENTIES timepiece.<br/><br/>The scenery throughout the movie is good also but we don't watch a movie b/c it has a great view of a person running on a mountainside. <br/><br/>When I found out this movie came out the same year as Raiders of the Lost Ark, my jaw hit the floor. There is no way this was the best picture of 1981 and it is proof that some years, the Oscar idiots don't even come close. I have a theory that you can sometimes pick the most ""Jewish"" picture and it will win the award. I would bet that this holds true for 1981. B/c one of the characters has a Jewish background, it ended up winning. I know it's a stupid theory, but it works sometimes and holds water when a movie like this is picked over a much more entertaining and pleasurable movie like Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie is good, not great. It's overrated and never deserved an Oscar for best picture. The only Oscar it deserved was best original score and it won that. Justice was not served in the others that it won and I can only imagine what great movies were overlooked that year. In the end, I just didn't care about this story b/c of it's plot and uninspired acting and did not deserve all the Oscar accolades that it got. 3/10 stars--probably one of the worst picks for Best Picture until Million Dollar Baby came out."

","Two British track athletes, one a determined Jew and the other a devout Christian, compete in the 1924 Olympics.<br/><br/>So, yeah, this is a movie that is probably better known for its soundtrack than its actual plot. That Vangelis theme? Can you even count all the times it was used and parodied? No, because no one can count that high. And yet, how many of us can name the runners in the 1924 Olympics, some of whom are featured prominently here? Almost none of us.<br/><br/>How this film rocked the Academy Awards is a bit of a mystery, though the 1980s were a strange time, especially for movies. This is a really good film, but the best one of 1981? Doubtful. (Then again, even today the Academy does seem to pick the right choice... that is a rather rare event.)"
"vox-sane","10","5","8","19 July 2004"," Wonderful Evocation of the Era of Sportsmanship
","Understated as it is, ""Chariots of Fire"" may not be to every taste.  For instance, one has to be a devotee of Gilbert and Sullivan to understand some of the nuances.  The acting is uniformly superb.  Old veterans (Ian Holm, John Gielgud, Patrick Magee, Nigel Davenport) lend support to rising new faces (Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers) as young runners preparing for the 1924 Paris Olympics.  <br/><br/>The era of true sportsmanship is evoked, when the Olympics meant more than it does today.  The trainer of Harold Abrahams, Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm in a delightfully crafted supporting role) is not even allowed in the Olympic stadium in Paris because he is a professional.<br/><br/>The two main runners, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) wrestle not only with their extensive training, but with principle.  Abrahams is a Jew striving to overcome his society's anti-Semitism by out-running them -- as well as his inner demons. Liddell, training as a Christian missionary (he would later die in a Chinese prison camp after the second World War), runs for God but is confronted by a matter of principle that tests whether his devotion is to his God or his sport (and his country).<br/><br/>The changes the script made from history, necessary for telling a story and building dramatic tension, are pointed out in this movie more than they are for other films that build their stories on history, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""Becket"" (Thomas Becket wasn't Saxon, for instance).  It's well-known that Abrahamson wasn't as pestered by anti-Semitism as the movie portrays, and Liddell knew about his Sunday race well ahead of time.  Good story-telling necessitates such changes.  The film should not be viewed as strictly biographical but as a study of dedication, both to sport and to faith, and how two very different, but equally devoted, young men deal with the dilemmas of their devotion.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent.  The famous (twenty years ago, ubiquitous) Vangelis score, at first distracting, becomes inseparable from the visual images on repeated viewings.  The movie has a deliberate pace and makes no concession to the modern ""summer movie"" audience.  There are no explosions, no one is killed, and there's also no ""villain"" in the conventional sense as Abrahams and Liddell struggle to confront and overcome their sublimated challenges to achieve  personal victories.<br/><br/>The film is well shot.  The opening visual, of the young Olympians running along the shore, has become iconic.  The races are all shot differently. Since the runners are sprinters and their races are over quickly, slo-mo is used extensively.  Nevertheless, every race has a distinct look and they never seem redundant.  Vangelis is also a great help setting each race differently.<br/><br/>One caveat:  the movie begins with and unnecessary framing device and two (or is it three?) flashbacks, the first from a memorial service to the run on the beach and the horns that announce Vangelis' theme;  and the second after the opening credits.  After these false starts, the movie settles into a leisurely pace as it carefully unrolls the intertwined stories of Abrahams and Liddell and their struggles trying to buck the rigid conformity of their society (for though nominally Christian, Liddell fights against the system every inch as much as Abrahams, finding as he does that the opprobrious term ""fanatic"" was applied to those who actually try to live out what they say they believe when the intangibles of faith comes into conflict with the reality of society's norms.)<br/><br/>A feel-good movie for anyone who enjoys true competition, and well worthy of the accolades heaped upon it after its release."

"lasttimeisaw","7","3","4","18 February 2017"," an overachiever and unworthy Oscar winner?
","This Oscar-winning UK picture has been long bad-mouthed as an overachiever and unworthy champion ever since it usurped the top honor from its more artistically ambitious opponents, especially, Warren Beatty's long-in-gestation, epic passion project REDS (1981). It is an underdog's triumph, not unlike the real-life story it depicts, two Golden medals from UK running team in the Paris Olympics, 1924. <br/><br/>One of the two winners is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), an English Jew who enters the Cambridge in 1919, and the other is Eric Liddell (Charleson), a Scottish missionary born in China (and would later die in China in a Japanese civilian internment camp in 1945), thereof, the main obstacle against Abrahams' rising is the anti-Semitism pervading the British academia, whereas in Liddell's case, the through-line is his devout persuasion and unswerving conviction that ""he will not run on Sundays"" not even for the sake of the monarchy. Both accounts are interwoven steadily with jaunty verve and charming lucidity, and put the reasons behind their running to the forefront.<br/><br/>In spite of a face-off in the same competition, brotherly rivalry is never the thorny issue (although it would be undeniable more interesting than the patriotic hagiography in the offer) once they both are recruited to partake in the Olympics, together, they must take up the gauntlet from the elite across the Atlantic Ocean (two US cinematic rising stars, Brad Davis and Dennis Christopher, are cast in small parts). Liddell would stir quite a controversy with his intractability but as long as he would win, it only incarnates his integrity. <br/><br/>Inherently, running doesn't entail too much visual grandeur and their duration is fleeting, Abrahams wins in the 100 meter (barely over 10 seconds) and Liddell prevails in the 400 meter race (less than 50 seconds) respectively, so in order to accentuate the tension and glory of the process, director Hugh Hudson pragmatically implements the slo-motion shots to capture the racing moments of the two, especially Liddell, whose spiritual immersion has reached an almost grotesque state of hallowed elation, shows up the sublime pull of competitive sports from a rarefied stance. And of course, it couldn't be honed up to that effect without the anachronistic electronic score by Greek musician Vangelis. <br/><br/>The core young cast boosts great empathy of comradeship and determination (although one can quibble not all of them is endowed with a professional runner's physique), Ben Cross and the late Ian Charleson are fine picks but a beaming Nigel Havers is the one who infuses something altruistically wonderful in his wide-eyed conviviality meanwhile Alice Krige is radiant in her silver- screen debut as Sybil, Abrahams' love-interest. Among the veteran bracket, John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson delightfully pair up as a Cambridge duo of uppishness and Nigel Davenport leaves a pungent mark of cunningness as Lord Birkenhead, but it is Ian Holm's half-Arabic, half- Italian running coach Sam Mussabini takes the token Oscar nomination for the ensemble. <br/><br/>In hindsight, CHARIOTS OF FIRE is an ostensibly feel-good fare with all its edges being circumspectly smoothed, a dedicates piece of work to propagate sportsmanship and a not-too- subtle agitprop boasting UK's glory and heritage, as well as the consummate devotion of one's religion, a safe bet pandering to a more general, Western-leaning taste but of high-calibre production value, that is, to this day, still the winning formula to allure Oscar votes."
"Leofwine_draca","6","3","4","5 January 2017"," Well-mounted sports epic
","CHARIOTS OF FIRE is undoubtedly one of the finest sports movies ever made because it isn't just about sports per se. Instead, it's a period picture summoning up life in the 1920s, with deep characterisation, strong and subtle acting from the principle actors, and a great attention to detail. The subject matter explores the topic of religion in a sensitive way, while the various running scenes are artily directed and extremely memorable, thanks in part to that classic theme music which really is something to behold.<br/><br/>The film stars Ben Cross in a strong turn as a put-upon Jew whose bad temper and grievances threaten to derail him; also here are career-making performances from Nicholas Farrell and Nigel Havers, two actors who would go on to repeat the same type of roles they play here throughout their careers. Although the familiar faces of John Gielgud and Nigel Davenport round out the 'elder statesman' type roles, it's Ian Holm who really shines in a part which is a 180 degree turn from his one in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT."
"SnoopyStyle","6","3","4","2 December 2014"," A bit stuffy
","In 1924, a Jew Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and devoted Christian Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) are training to go to the Olympics in Paris. Back in 1919, Abrahams faces prejudice from the Anglo Saxon establishment in the University of Cambridge. He falls for Gilbert and Sullivan actress Sybil Gordon (Alice Krige). Meanwhile Liddell runs in the Scotland highlands despite misgivings from his devout sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell). He's born from missionaries in China. After Abrahams loses to Liddell, he is devastated and gets coaching help from Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm). At the Olympics, Liddell's 100 meter race heat is schedule for Sunday but he refuses to race on the Sabbath.<br/><br/>These are pretty stuffy true life stories. It's not quite as compelling probably because the attention is split between two characters. Both are compelling historical figures and both deserve the attention. Director Hugh Hudson's style is rather conventionally competent. This is Oscar bait. It's a well made biopic of uplifting historical stories. The most interesting aspect of the movie to me is the music from Vangelis. It is synth heaven. The problem is that the movie can't narrow its focus only on Abrahams because of what happened in the Olympics. However Liddell isn't a very compelling story until the Olympics."

","If you don't like this movie, then you don't get it. I had to watch this movie as a school project and thought it was amazing. To be able to get the real message of the movie, you have to dig deeper. When Eric Liddell says ""God made countries, God makes kings, and the rules by which they govern. And those rules say that the Sabbath is His. And I for one intend to keep it that way."" he is not insulting anyone, he is simply stating the fact that he himself wants to live by the laws. If you ever get in a situation where someone is trying to change you mind on a moral decision use the line ""I intend to keep it that way."" Also, Eric Liddell says "" I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure."" When you do some thin you love, do you feel God's pleasure. Try to feel it next time. Also, a reverend says ""You can praise God by peeling a spud if you peel it to perfection. Don't compromise. Compromise is a language of the devil. Run in God's name and let the world stand back and in wonder."" What he is saying is that you can honor God by doing simple things perfectly. Everything you do, doesn't have to be great. Do not compromise because it means you are giving in, and when you give in, it means you are falling away from what you believe. I will admit, the movie starts out kind of bland, but turns into a movie that, if you truly understand the meaning, can bring you to tears. Aubrey and Lindsay watched their friends die, watched the legends die. The movie is their remembrance of them. ""Let us praise famous men and our fathers that begot us. All these men were honored in their generations and were a glory in their days. We are here today to give thanks for the life of Harold Abrahams. To honor the legend.

","Although a very awe inspiring movie, probably one of the best about track and field and motivation of runners in the Olympics, it has a number of historical inaccuracies. But I believe these licenses were taken to promote dramatic tension and the underlying message of the lives of two very great men in a time of great men and women! Don't forget that this movie premiered in 1981 and many movies took dramatic license without declaring that they were based on...etc. Movies have done that more and more recently, and are less factual than Chariots ever was. Check out the Mothman Prophecies, it's just vaguely like the book. So I am not offended that Eric Liddell knew about the 400 a year in advance, or that Jackson Schultz never gave him that note, although in fact a note was given. Or that Harold Abrams ran in an earlier Olympics and won nothing although he was a great athlete and well loved by his schoolmates. But I believe that it captures the spirit of two very driven men and the differing motivations that drove them, and in so doing immortalizes them, the times, and those around them!"

The other is (Harold Abrahams) played by Ben Cross, who wants to prove to everyone included the Cambridge society that he belongs and have them look at his personal achievements and not focus so much on him being a Jew.<br/><br/>The story is told in flashbacks showing Liddell's and Abraham's journey from simple sprinters to competing in the Olympic games in 1924.<br/><br/>It was very heavy going for me to watch as I feel it goes at a slow pace and only seems to get exciting and interesting when the races are happening. I was a little bored with the scenes in-between and found myself zoning out of the movie but when the racing scenes happened I was glued to them and found my heart beating that the men would succeed in their ambition to win a medal.

Terry Rawlings did a superb job of editing the film and the cast did a good job, Nicholas Farrell, Nigel Havers, John Gielgud and Ian Holm who are the best actors Britain has to offer.<br/><br/>The film won 4 Oscars, Best Costume Design, Best Picture, Original Score; Best Director and Best Writing for a screenplay.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the film, I would say watch the film and decide for your self as it really depends if you like sporting films and particularly a gentler pace of story telling."

","Films made in the U.K., or anywhere else, don't necessarily strike a nerve with Americans. Such films -I except the James Bond series- require the willing acceptance of a foreign cultural context to which U.S. viewers often seem stubbornly resistent. ""Chariots of Fire"" is the happy exception, a trip over the ocean and back into time which millions made in 1981. Even those who'd never heard of Corinthian spirit appreciated its display here.<br/><br/>Tall, thin Ben Cross, who would make a perfect Sherlock Holmes someday, gives a spot-on performance as grouchy old Harold Abrahams, as disagreeable as a postwar sports administrator as he was when competing in the Twenties. The late Scotsman Ian Charleson has a harder task, making something other than a wide-eyed innocent of Eric Liddell, rugby/track star and Presbyterian missionary. The two actors, and their respective characters, chisel out definitions of confidence in completely opposite ways.<br/><br/>Oddly, the producers chose to commission an avant-garde electronic score from Greek-born Brit Vangelis. If everything else was so scrupulously authentic, down to having a veteran track coach teach the actors how to stride in a way long obsolete, why not program music appropriate to the Jazz Age?"

"Cherubin","7","4","6","3 June 2001"," all that matters is sports and religion
","Contrary to some other reviewers, I did not find ""Chariots of Fire"" to be boring. This was mostly because of the racing sequences, which are beautifully shot and pay attention to various tiny yet striking details such as the shaking wine glass on top of a hurdle,  Eric loudly gasps for air after winning a race, or the dramatic beginning of a race set to the chiming of  chapel bells. ""Chariots of Fire"" did for track what ""The Tin Cup"" did for golf - take a sport that is usually dull to watch and make it seem exciting. It also has the great emotional scene in which Harold confides his concerns about losing to his girlfriend. The film also has an interesting feel for its time period. Plus, creating an adult oriented movie virtually without any explicit content like this one is quite a feat by today´s standards. However, I did not feel that the movie was particularly great either. Basically, the problem with it is that neither Harold nor Eric are very well rounded characters. Harold´s character seems to begin and end with his furious desire to be a track champion in order to spite the Britons who look down on his Jewish background (although the antisemitism he encounters in the movie never seems to go beyond mild teasing). Eric´s character, in a similar way, begins and ends with him being obsessed with running track because he believes that his speed is a gift from God and being committed to his religion to the point of refusing to run on a Sunday. Except for tiny details like the fact that they both like Gilbert and Sullivan, that is all we ever learn about them. The result is that the movie plays like a simplistic ""Rocky"" style motivational feelgood movie rather than a thought provoking drama. Eric and Harold are so at odds with each other that one would expect at least one heated argument, debate or competition between them. This never happens. Rather, they just have a boring, quiet respect for each other. They also do not seem to have lives outside of running track except for those moments when their ""civilian lives"" are CONNECTED to running track in some way. The movie also has the problem of lacking even a vague sense of humor, and, in my opinion, one would be hard pressed to find an all time great movie that is also utterly humorless."
"zwrite2","5","8","16","2 January 2008"," Movie should have been less 'boring'
","The debate about ""Chariots of Fire"" has always been whether it is boring. As a young man, I thought it was very boring. As a middle-aged man, I found it far less boring this week.<br/><br/>Let me suggest, though, that the debate should be far more substantive  whether the writers did a good job of portraying the two main characters and the rivalry between them. If the answer was yes, ""Chariots"" would have been much less boring.<br/><br/>The movie has three problems: <br/><br/>1. ERIC LIDDELL'S PORTRAYAL: This man was fascinating. He sacrificed his life while in his 40s because he was a Christian missionary in China. Yet, he is NOT portrayed as fascinating.<br/><br/>We're told he wants to be a missionary, but we should have been SHOWN this. This could have been done via flashbacks to his childhood when his parents were missionaries or via his missionary work if there was any. Speeches to Scottish lads just don't convey his zeal. Instead, we see a relatively cardboard-cutout portrayal of a very religious person.<br/><br/>2. HAROLD ABRAHAMS' PORTRAYAL: I'm Jewish. There has been virtually no discrimination against me, but my father and others of his generation have told me stories that were far more interesting than anything Abrahams went through in this movie.<br/><br/>The stories I've heard were about discrimination in 1950s New York City. It is not credible that Abrahams didn't suffer far more bias in 1920s England. Snide remarks by snotty old men and Abrahams' plaintive wail that was mocked by his girlfriend just aren't interesting. The writers should have found out about the anti-Semitic incidents that undoubtedly occurred.<br/><br/>3. THE LIDDELL ABRAHAMS RIVALRY: Liddell won one race and Abrahams was upset about it. They barely talked to each other!! It's hard to believe their rivalry couldn't have been more vividly portrayed. Did they like each other? What did they say to each other and about each other? There was relatively little tension between them.<br/><br/>Confrontations make plots less boring. Two of the best scenes in ""Chariots"" are Abrahams telling officials that he won't fire his coach and Liddell telling them he will not run on the Sabbath. The movie would have been much better if Abrahams and Liddell had confrontations regarding their religion with others and personal tiffs with each other.<br/><br/>I had one other problem with ""Chariots."" After watching it, I researched whether Abrahams and Liddell won medals in races not portrayed on screen. They did. In the course of this research, I noticed that NO hurdler named Andrew Lindsay medaled in the 1924 Olympics. Upon further research, I learned Lindsay does NOT exist.<br/><br/>I understand that writers often take creative license with the truth. I read ""Schindler's List."" In the movie, there were at least a few incidents where the Itzhak Stern character did things that in real life were actually done by others. This was understandable because too many characters can confuse viewers and introducing them can waste lots of time.<br/><br/>However, Stern was real, he was portrayed accurately, and the incidents involving him were close to accurate. Other incidents like Schindler rescuing an employee from a train heading toward a concentration camp did occur although it was not Stern who was rescued.<br/><br/>What the writers of ""Chariots"" did in fabricating a person when they had several British runners, some of them medalists, to base a composite character around was UNFORGIVABLE.<br/><br/>After watching ""Chariots of Fire,"" I gave it a 6. But, I penalized it one point afterward for making up Lindsay. My rating is 5.<br/><br/>ZWrite"

In other words, those who love Friday 13th part XLV or anything made by Pauley Shore will be bored to death and should avoid this film like the plague (as they might accidentally learn something).<br/><br/>Now, this does not mean this movie is for elitist snobs. Nope--you can be an average bloke and still become mesmerized by the terrific and incredibly realistic acting, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful costumes, brilliant script and lovely music by Vangelis.<br/><br/>The movie is a generally true story about two parallel lives--Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams. Both were destined to win the gold medal at the 1924 Olympics but the actual journey there and the lives they led were so different. How they were woven together to form one beautiful tapestry is why this movie is great. See this film and don't worry that it won the Oscar for Best Picture--this is one of the few over the past several decades that both deserved it AND was entertaining (something the Oscar people usually do not consider)."

","Chariots of Fire, widely considered a classic, is first and foremost an overrated movie that, who knows how, won 4 Oscars including the coveted best picture and best screenplay.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes are particularly tedious because of how badly structured they are: Hugh Hudson got all tangled up in the portrait of the two main characters and the times of the scenes that alternate roughly between past and present. The rest isn't better as the plot unfolds in total linearity even during the Olympic Games that were supposed to be the apotheosis of the movie but turned out to be flat.<br/><br/>The story is just very little interesting and probably didn't deserve a script in the first place, and that's the big handicap of this feature: it's hard to find the destiny of these two athletes captivating. The dialogues are long, flat and bland, emphasizing a bit more the overall lack of dynamism.<br/><br/>One will take comfort in a few well filmed (if that) training and running scenes, but that is about it."
"jdkraus","7","5","10","4 April 2008"," This did not deserve Best Picutre for 1981
","After finally seeing ""Chariots of Fire"", I now understand what all the fuss is about it. Vangelis' score is simply brilliant, a well-deserved Oscar. The costume and set-decoration add to the authenticity of the film's time period. The work of cinematography gives the dramatic feeling of the film. The screenplay and actors are good. But of the other nominees for Best Picture in 1981, I found this to be a feeble win at the Academy.<br/><br/>Unlike ""On Golden Pond"", the movie does not develop great characters nor does it have memorable performances like Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn delivered. The motives of the two runners, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) are understandable. Both are competitive individuals and with such a competition, they push themselves harder and harder. But they both come from different religious families.<br/><br/>Harold, who's Jewish, feels it is his obligation to make himself the best, for fame and to escape prejudice. However, there is no external conflict shown in the movie that makes him feel so determined to be the best. For most individuals, it takes something from the past to spark someone's heavy interest in such a thing. A person just doesn't wake up one morning and say I'm going to be a runner. I felt his character wasn't developed, just thrown into Cambridge, running laps, saying, ""I need to do better than this"" to the amusing Ian Holm.<br/><br/>It is also the same with Eric. As a catholic Scot, he feels it's his job to win for God. Well, why? Sure, the film shows that he has a religious uptight family, but the story does not broaden off of that. The movie doesn't even bother to develop his relationship that diminishes with his significant other. So, I am left as a mere observer rather than being pulled into the film.<br/><br/>The only thing that pulled me into the film was Vangelis' score which made the movie. I enjoyed the slow-motion images of the runners running, but it got very tiresome after awhile, particularly at the end of the movie with the Olympic Games. I couldn't help but laugh at the actor's faces as they ran in slow-motion. It almost made me think of the different expressions Bruce Banner would make as he's mutating into the Hulk.<br/><br/>In addition without strong character development, the accents are very thick. I have no problem with Brits, but when I have to put subtitles on the DVD in order to understand what the people are saying, it becomes a real hassle. It's not a bad movie, but nothing that deserved close to Best Picture. 7/10 If you won't great movies of 1981, see ""Raiders of The Lost"" or ""On Golden Pond""."
"DublinUF","5","6","13","20 March 1999"," Not as good as it could be.
","Basically, I have read comments on both sides of the fence on this one and I think both sides are right.<br/><br/>Chariots is well acted, well scored and has many interesting details that led to a best picture nod.<br/><br/>Chariots also uses way too much slow motion and does a poor job of filming the actual races it is building too. I think what struck me the hardest was Abrahams last race for the 100-meter gold. We spent the whole sequence leading up to it staring at everyone in slow motion.<br/><br/>Then when the gun sounded it kicked into full speed. It could have been a resounding effect, but alas the only runner we focused on was Abrahams. In a race, you have to know where the other runners are to know who is winning. As much as the close up on Abrahams told of his spirit, he could have been in last for all I knew.<br/><br/>This is indicative of all the races in the movie. There was not adequate setup. I constantly felt thrown into races trying to figure if it was an Abrahams race or a Liddell race or worse at the Olympics -- one featuring neither.<br/><br/>Also, I never firmly grasped what either Lindsay or Aubrey were doing or who was who. They both seem to be important characters...heck on the credits they get top billing...and yet there is no character work on them at all in the film.<br/><br/>I guess what I am saying is that while I felt is was a good film, I also felt that it could have been so much better if the movie was not constantly thrusting us into a fog."

","A Cambridge Jew (Harold Abrams) and an unaffiliated Christian (Eric Liddell) make their way to the 1924 Paris Olympics. One, by far the more interesting character, spends much time griping about anti-Semitism (not shown ..?) and the other feels the lord needs another missionary. The basic problem with C.o.F. is that the writers can't scare up a decent conflict. And Abrams and Liddel share one flimsy greeting in a locker room, so it remains a puzzle why they share a movie. Not helping things is the chilly distance the production adopts; although the cast is quite extensive, no character develops any issue unrelated to the official storyline, which is crystal-clear after ten minutes.<br/><br/>Liddel is the sort who can't wait to tell everyone how humble he is, and that everyone should aspire to be humble like him. He's hen-pecked by his lemon-sucking sister (quite a trick) who's using religion to make him bend to her will, not God's. Together they have their Christian humility turned up to eleven. Abram's (Ben Cross) storyline is slightly better, but nothing you haven't seen before. If anti-Semitism is wrong, one gets the feeling it's only because it's beneath him as a classy, urbane snob. Everyone suffers over trifles rather photogenically, none better than Cross, who is an unusually striking man. This is the kind of movie that viewers watch and passively dispense a rave in response to overt ""Best Picture"" production values, in the mistaken belief that great movies are about taste. But as usual, taste has little to do with art.<br/><br/>As a travelogue the movie inspires with historic locations, international travel, and it can't help but make a viewer more worldly. As a poor pre-teen it provided me with fantasies of opportunities and accomplishments, but as an ""inspirational movie"" in 2009, it's rather inert. Vangelis' intentionally anachronistic music once worked but is now obtrusive."

","Coming from different backgrounds, two men come together to represent Britain in the 1924 Olympics in the track sprint. Harold Abrahams is a Jewish academic, known to be very fast, having become the first to break a long standing University challenge to race around the courtyard in 12 strikes. Eric Liddell is a devout Scottish Christian and rugby star who has been chosen to rise to the top of his field as a way of promoting Christianity. The two men face different obstacles to make it to their goal but both strive towards the Olympics with one thing in target  victory.<br/><br/>For years I thought I had seen this film and it was only recently I decided that I had not. I could recall the famous scenes, recognise the music but yet I could not remember much else so I can only assume that I had picked it up from popular culture rather than first hand. However watching it now I must admit that I could easily have watched it and totally forgotten it because it is a totally forgettable film that seems intent on making me proud to be British by reminding me how good it is to be bland. The plot is interesting in theory but the delivery does nothing with it and just stays on the surface of the material with a tale of stiff upper lips and decorum but no character, emotional engagement or excitement. I know that British period films have a reputation for being very folded in on themselves and restrained but the best ones contrast that with what is underneath  Chariots of Fire seems determined to ignore anything occurred between the words in the script.<br/><br/>I wonder why it has its reputation as a great film because I see very little outside of a patriotic swell that would make people (far less the award ceremonies) love it so much. Hudson's direction is fine  a bit stiff and obvious but generally good enough to do the job although did he presume the constant use of slow-motion would have us all on the edge of our seats? If so, he was wrong  it gets tired very quickly (although that may be its status in popular culture working against it). The cast do what is asked of them but, because this is not a great deal, they didn't do anything for me despite the number of faces in it. Cross and Charleson are both pretty bland and they easily have scenes stolen from them by small turns from the underperforming likes of Havers, Anderson, Gielgud, Magee and Holm.<br/><br/>Overall this is a stiff British film with nothing of interest happening beyond the simplistic piece of patriotism and story telling. The narrative is dull and the characters could easily have been replaced with bricks without losing any depth. The cast try hard to produce a serious British period film but the material gives them nothing to work with whatsoever. Succeeds on the level of looking professional and being very British and I suppose that must be sufficient for some people; unfortunately two hours later I decided that it wasn't enough for me."

A quick vox pop of IMDb reviewers shows that this is a movie that draws strong negative emotions as well as strong positive ones. You have every right not to like any work of art, but you have to acknowledge that the general audience prefers cheap thrills to thinking.<br/><br/>This doesn't even feature a real villain - no matter drugs, sex or violence!<br/><br/>Yes it might not be to everyone's taste, but COF is one of those movies that could not be really improved upon given its targets, intentions and budget. It is not a perfect, but it is perfectly realized.<br/><br/>The film tries to wrap itself around events that are broadly true, but it also shows that real life - however outstanding - doesn't always help the dramatist. Abrahams (Ben Cross) is shown being persecuted and haunted for being a Jew, while there is no evidence of it, indeed he became an authority figure later without objection from anyone. Even the romance portrayed here actually happened years after the film ended! <br/><br/>Meanwhile Liddell (Ian Charlson) is a dedicated man-of-god who won't compete on a Sunday (that is true - although facts around this are NOT as explained here!) Sadly that is also the day of the 100 yard (sic) final. A bit of a two dimensional character, in his dedication to ""doing god's work"", but a true sportsman and also a rugby international (mentioned only once in passing). He later died an early death for his beliefs.<br/><br/>(Curious that the actor convincingly playing him should take the opposite path and died young too!)<br/><br/>Anyone that wants a lesson in how important a musical score is to a movie should view this. The Evangelos Odysseus Papathanassiou (that is his real name!) title track is a ""hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck"" classic - although, curiously, the electronic music is totally out-of-time with the period the film tries to evoke!<br/><br/>The strangest thing about this film that I wasn't really that impressed with it the first time I saw it. However with repeat viewings I liked it more and more, to the point in which I would put it in my own personal top ten of all time. <br/><br/>Great sports movies are rare and while I am both British and a sports fan I am sure that people who are neither can enjoy this film as well. Raiders of the Lost Arc was an enjoyable film, but it was also a cartoon and cartoons can't win Best Picture Oscars - it isn't right.<br/><br/>So it isn't in the top 250 of all-time movies? So people don't like it? But who has seen the ""better"" Die Hard twice and seen more in it the second time? This did good business at the box office world-wide, it won awards (including the big one), the soundtrack works like a dream and there is some classic scenes and an uplifting climax. Everything a film should be and the best of the 1980's for me.<br/><br/>P.S The title refers to a line in the hymn Jerusalem by William Blake (1757-1827) which explores the obscure theory that Jesus once visited England.<br/><br/>""And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountain green?

","What an incredible film.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire tells the true story of two British Olympians who strove for gold in the 1924 Paris Olympics. The two, however, begin as rivals and each of their ambitions act as counterpoint to the other. Eric Lidell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Christian missionary but so naturally gifted as a runner and driven by his belief in God he is able to succeed. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) runs because he has something to prove; as a Jewish man in England in the 1920s, he is an outcast. He runs out of a sense of indignation and to prove his worth to others and to himself.<br/><br/>This is where the film becomes exceptional. It focuses on the characters. The races are not seen as events of celebration and are not focused on by the director Hugh Hudson. Running is shown in the runners' perspectives; gritty and real, a struggle and a journey. Their focus is shown in the quiet, muted background noise, and the firm thuds of their feet as they run. Their self-fulfilment is evoked by Vangelis' soundtrack, which truly deserves all the praise it is given.<br/><br/>Cross acts very well as a confused, brooding but determined young man. We feel his anger at loss, sympathise with his situation and are inspired by his hard work. Charleson plays the quintessential honourable Christian, a trope made interesting by the conflict the character has reconciling his faith and his running.<br/><br/>It's very easy to say this film is dated and represents bygone British patriotism and class distinction unpalatable with today's norms. But films like this find their relevance in the examination of human nature and everything else in the film is merely the stage for these ideas to be realised.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire hearkens back to the idea of being able to succeed no matter your background, beliefs or challenges."

","As the 1924 Paris Olympics approach, two different but equally determined young British men prepare themselves for a chance at glory. One, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is an English Jew attending Cambridge University, along with his friends and fellow athletes Aubrey Montague (Nicholas Farrell), Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers) and Henry Stallard (Daniel Gerroll). The other, devout Christian and proud Scot raised in China, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), seems to have the ability to leave anyone he races against in his wake. One is racing against prejudice, the other for the God he believes gave him the ability to run. But with the Americans dominating the sport, do they have a chance at taking the gold medal?<br/><br/>Because of the amount of times I've seen this film lampooned, with the use of its music played over something in slow-motion, I was expecting this film to have become a parody of itself. I was not expecting something as brilliant and profoundly moving as I did experience. From the opening scene that depicts the main characters running along the beach in slow-motion to that score, I was hooked. How a film that begins in 1919 and is steeped in period detail can work with a very 80's synthesised score is beyond me, but it works wonderfully, and was a massive risk that is pulled off.<br/><br/>Slight historical inaccuracies and tweaks from the sake of narrative aside, the film strongest point comes in its authenticity. For all the films that try and look wonderful in the period dress and detail, few actually feel like its set in the time. For example, Gangs Of New York, was gorgeous and I'm sure the costumes and sets were very accurate, but it always feels like you're watching actors on a set. Chariots Of Fire convinces while seeming effortless, with the clothes and props having a 'lived-in' feel.<br/><br/>Apart from the visual delights, there are the two leads who both went criminally unrecognised at the Academy Awards. Ben Cross is all steely determination and frustrated rage as Abrahams, who is the inferior runner to Liddell. And Ian Charleson, a celebrated stage actor who tragically died nine years after this film was made, is just a naturally fine actor who plays the devout Christian Eric Liddell with such an ease and intelligence that he deserved an Academy Award nomination at the very least. But those Oscar voters don't get it right very often, although the film did bring home Best Picture.<br/><br/>It has been criticised for its inaccuracies. Lord Lindsay didn't exist and is a stand-in for the real-life Lord Burghley, and Aubrey Montague attended Oxford, not Cambridge. The note that is handed to Liddell just before his big race by the American runner Jackson Scholz (Brad Davis) that wishes him luck was actually given to him by an American masseur, and it is said that Abrahams faced very little persecution due to the fact that he was Jewish at Cambridge. They are others too, but, to me, this is a film about two great sportsmen using their ability to speak for what they believe in. If you want an accurate account of what actually happened, you can read a biography or look on Wikipedia. The film makes changes for more power and to get its point across, while keeping the majority of the true-life story correct.<br/><br/>A wonderfully intelligent film that is packed with great performances, stunning cinematography, and subtle period detail, with a distinct Britishness about it that seemed to have been lost in the 1960's. And as much as that score is made fun of, it still packs the same power and remains oddly stirring.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Their essence, their essential identity, is the key to their success as runners.<br/><br/>It is unwise to look to closely at Hollywood scripts to see how far they will veer from reality; while this one is remarkably accurate, it falls short in some important ways.<br/><br/>But no one reads Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" or ""Macbeth"" or ""Hamlet"" as studies in 'real' people; these plays are expositions of character. The audience leaves wondering what they would do in such a position; wonders if they would ever end up in such a position.<br/><br/>And here the film lives up to that question. The viewer admires the character study presented in the film without having to know the 'facts,' the 'details' of the 1924 Olympics.<br/><br/>And here's the point. Many athletes --students-- must except their limitations that God gave them. The athlete has a unique set of gifts from God to perform at that level of sustained excellence: hand-eye coordination, muscular strength, swiftness, dexterity. The student cannot be tempted to take steroids in an attempt to 'improve' their performance. The whole point of athletic contests is this contest, this challenge of the body--the God given body. To alter that equation is to alter the contest. Sadly, it's an observation most athletes seem unable to grasp.<br/><br/>And when athletes set an example of poor sportsmanship, and the student follows suit, the student puts health at risk using steroids.<br/><br/>The movie set its premise without a whole lot of sentimentality, and in a direct, forthright manner. The music provided a reflection of their achievement--soaring with quiet steadfast excellence."

","Ah yes, running in slow motion. We've all done it. To Vangelis's music from CHARIOTS OF FIRE.<br/><br/>British film, written by Colin Welland, directed by Hugh Hudson, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, winning 4 (including Best Picture). CHARIOTS OF FIRE is based loosely on two real life British runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics, who run for very different reasons - one against anti-Semitism, one for Christianity.<br/><br/>Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), runs to win, to prove himself above the anti-Semitism he's experienced all his life; while Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) runs to glorify his Christian god: ""To win is to honor Him"" (which should make anyone trip over from laughing so hard. Even in slow motion).<br/><br/>Movie opens at Caius College Cambridge in 1919, when fervor for The Great War (though what made it ""great"" is beyond my ken) is still high in everyone's nostrils, and British supremacy was a reality in the world. Most of the British runners all meet here as students.<br/><br/>Different people would perceive different parts of this movie as inspirational. For an athlete, the running in slow motion, the sacrifices and the winning - both Liddell and Abrahams would go on to win their respective races and bring glory to Britain; for a religious fanatic, the nutty equating of Christ with racing - Liddell gives a speech loaded with metaphor, ""committing yourself to the love of Christ - that is how you run a straight race"" - demonstrably ridiculous, because Jewish Abrahams ran ""straight races"" as well, metaphorically as well as literally - by committing to the love of Allah.<br/><br/>And there are so much of Liddell's ravings and rantings and refusing to run on Sunday at the Olympics, that it turned me off the film. This real life athlete ruined a film honoring him because his character (Charleson) had to portray him as he really was - a lunatic.<br/><br/>Liddell's life plan is to visit China as a missionary, but he puts those plans on hold to attend the Olympics, because, ""I believe that God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure."" Sure you do. Anything as an excuse to rationalize why you do something fun. After the Games, he does actually give up running to spread the disease of Christianity in China.<br/><br/>Liddell meets with Olympic and state officials who urge him to compete in his Sunday race, ""In my day, it was king first, God after."" Liddell replies, ""God made countries, God makes kings, and the rules by which they govern."" God also makes wars. Reconcile that with your missionary work, Running Boy - oh, I forgot, missionary work IS insidious war, after all, on Other People's beliefs.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where it is pointless speaking of the performances, which are so natural and top notch, it is no wonder CHARIOTS received so many awards: Ian Holm is Abrahams' trainer, Sir John Gielgud once again defines Spectacularly Imperious by appearing in the dictionary right next to the word, and here as a College Master. Sadly, two young American actors who were stars in their own right appear here in their last major feature film before virtually disappearing from cinema, Dennis Christopher (who made his mark as the determined young bicyclist in BREAKING AWAY, 1979) and Brad Davis (who shook our foundations in the disturbing MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, 1978).<br/><br/>Watching both Abrahams and Liddell cheer each other on during their respective races for Britain - though both were mortal running enemies in Britain - was a joy that no religion could sully; the physicality of driving human bodies to such extremes of performance; the intricacy of cardiovascular function that fuels the human animal; the tendons, joints, muscles, bones impacting the Earth, surging forward in opposition to gravity; the wonder of the raging human adrenalin machine stretched past breaking point... If only Liddell could have understood there is a much more wondrous power than his mythical Christ - humanity.<br/><br/>Run from the truth, Eric! Run in slow motion!<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

I never was an athletic person in high school but this movie really showed me what an athletic person I can become. Also since it was done in the early 80's I understand the hard work that went into this movie. I also understand that movies were done only at the cost of the crew.

","Its been almost 25 years since I saw Chariots of Fire, and it is as inspiring to me today as it was then. In 1981 I was training to run a half marathon, and the film and music certainly helped me reach my goal. The film, however, went beyond helping me train for the half marathon. It did something more important. In Eric Liddell's speech/sermon after one of his races, he says ""where does the power come from to see the race to its end - from within."" In 1981 I was going through a difficult time at work. These words inspired me to see the problem through, and I am a stronger person for it. I still remember these words when faced with challenges today. This movie has had more impact on me than any other."
"Okonh0wp","Null","2","3","24 April 2004"," More than just a song
","Most people are familiar with the Vangelis' theme to this movie, but they don't know much about the film itself, and it's a shame that the film itself hasn't received enough recognition.        Today, when the defining climax comes in a sports movie, they can conviniently rely on slow-motion to create drama. If you've ever taped a basketball game or a baseball game, it's fun to take just that game winning shot or game-winning homerun and watch it frame-by-frame to be able to disect exactly how that batter was able to do that, and movies of the 90s (Angels in the Outfield, Iron Will, the Rookie, etc, i could name about 20 others) have picked up on that. But Chariots of Fire was able to create a lot of that drama without any slow motion or much of the technology that we have today. Instead, I think those races in the end are so captivating because the characters themselves engage us.<br/><br/>     The story takes place in 1920s Britain, and yes, it is true, people back then were able to run pretty fast, even though they wore funny-looking shoes. The two main characters are both sprinters with different motivation. The first, Harold Abrahams, is a promising young student at Oxford with a chip on his shoulder, he's Jewish and feels like an outsider. One of the things the film does really well is get that paradox across to us, we see the guy fit in really well, he gets girls, he gets to act in the school play and sing corny Brittish songs, and of course since he's so fast, he obviously has the respect of the other runners, but on the other hand, there's that slight difference between him and everyone else. It's partially a self-fulfilling prophecy, him feeling like an outsider makes him an outsider, but also some of the finer details of the film reinforce the point, the shots of the university, itself, look so gothic and non-Jewish. Either way, that subtleness really is part of how the film is so delicately made and able to give a grasp of the guy's kind of inner motivation.<br/><br/>
      At the same time, the movie follows a parallel plot of another sprinter Eric Lidell, who's dashing good looks and speeed win him many fans, but he's not really into that, he's a missionary and very devoted to God, but he loves running too, and as he tells one of the other sisters he works with, he feels that his two passions complement each other, and that he thinks that when he's running, he feels God's strength and he can also use his fame to talk about how great God is, so he follows through on that.<br/><br/>      The movie tells two captivating stories, with a great historic-period feel, but it is kind of interesting how the character's two paths never really collide, but rather seem to kind of coexist on the screen, harmoniously. Considering the two run the same event, and with the clashing ways in which religion motivates the two, you'd think that would set the stage for conflict, but oddly, it doesn't happen like that. The two first meet, and have a tense and contrived ""good luck to you"" exchange before the race in which one loses (I won't say which one), and when they get to the Olympics, Eric refuses to run the 100 because it takes place on the Sabbath, even though he's been training for that for months. While, there's some dissapointment that these two aren't gonna battle it out as predicted, that moment in the movie says a lot about the character, and I think by making the movie more about their inner journeys within themselves rather than verse each other, the movie boldly defies the predictable route."

","Okay let's face it, the 80's wasn't exactly the best decade for masterpiece film making, but Chariots Of Fire was one of the rare masterpieces in the decade.<br/><br/>This movie unlike most Hollywood products, is a character movie. Instead of having to tack on a big story, the characters were good enough to keep you watching. You didn't need any Hollywood storytelling to keep you watching. The performances by Ben Cross and Ian Charleson are fantastic and the great supporting cast holds up well.<br/><br/>If you are one who needs a huge story with explosions and overacting than Chariots Of Fire is not for you, but if you're looking for a movie that gets you involved with the characters and the story without having to cheese it up I definitely recommend this."
"keiko-8","10","2","3","29 June 2003"," Often misunderstood
","Chariots of Fire is perhaps the finest movie ever filmed. As other reviewers have pointed out it excels in many dimensions. The cinematography and historical recreation of the 1920's are beautifully done. It has an outstanding score and a wonderful cast with many superb performances. The writing and directing is excellent and I believe the film has some of the best editing in the history if film making.<br/><br/>The reason so many have found it disappointing is, I believe, because they have approached the film with one dimensional thinking. If the film is viewed as a ""film about running"" or ""about racial prejudice"" it will be misunderstood and not fully appreciated.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is a film that digs deep into the human spirit. It not only presents us with a story of two men and the motivations they have for running, it goes to the very heart of the questions of why we exist and what significance our lives will have.<br/><br/>As Harold Abrahams discovered before his most decisive race; his life had all come to the point of a few seconds in which he would attempt to justify all he had done and who he would become. Eric, the other main character struggles with the same issues in a different form. I won't give away any more plot than that to those who may not have seen the film.<br/><br/>While I enjoy many different film genre, my favorite films are those which examine the human spirit and what it is that makes us the people we are. Movies such as ""The trip to Bountiful"", ""All Passion Spent"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" are among the best and because they spend so much time on character development they are often criticized as ""slow moving"" or ""boring"".<br/><br/>
If properly understood and viewed with discernment, Chariots of Fire can be a film that elicits self examination and may even inspire a person to become more than they are or would have been otherwise. What more could anyone ask of a film?"
"didi-5","9","2","3","14 May 2003"," the British were coming ...
","At the Oscars when Chariots of Fire did exceptionally well for a British film at gong handing out time, writer Colin Welland announced 'The British are coming!' and predicted a renaissance for the UK.  We might have had the odd success since (notably Gandhi the following year) but nothing on the scale expected.  So, is Chariots a good film?  Viewing it again recently, I think it has held up well since 1981.  Everyone in it is really good, the music of Vangelis and Gilbert & Sullivan fit as soundtrack at various points, the story of the two students running for their own personal reasons (Harold Abrahams because he feels an outcast as a Jew in a predominately Gentile world, Eric Liddell because he feels his talent is a gift from God and runs in God's name) is an interesting one, and the intelligent script and rounded characters give the film some backbone.  The only cast members really to benefit from this film long term were Ian Holm (already known from films and theatre) and Nigel Havers.  The others have tended to drift and occasionally surface in small roles, and sadly Ian Charleson, Brad Davis, and Jeremy Sinden are no longer with us.  The ongoing popularity of this film is a tribute to their memory and showcases their talents well."
"faldo8","Null","2","3","16 April 2002"," Misinterpreted.
","I am surprised that there has been so little commented on the main theme of the movie:  a sociological and philosophical matter that has been the point of conjecture for many years to students and academics the world over.  I am of course referring to the notion of ""amateurism"", which is the main issue of the movie.<br/><br/>People seem to be missing the point - amateurism was a blatant tool for class warfare, no matter how idealistic it's philosophies.  This movie offers prime examples of the mechanisms behind amateurism, and give good working examples of the cult of muscular christianity in Edwardian English society.<br/><br/>Now, this my all seem like academic dribble to some people, but it can't be denied that sport plays a huge part in society.  And the modern Olympics are the big players in sport.  Amateurism and it's enforces have shaped sport and thus society for over 100 years now, and this movie is giving examples of this.  It is NOT glorifying anything, as is the opinion of my friends. It is trying to make a statement, and show people some of the perspectives involved.  <br/><br/>As I said earlier, amateurism is a tool for class warfare.  It's sad people don't get it..."

","Fresh, almost easy-going drama that looks at two men from Great Britian, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), both of whom decide to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics, that's in Paris.  What makes these two lads different is what each one is motivated by, which surprised me.  And one has certainly to ask why the athletes in this time appear to be so calm and hardly panic.<br/><br/>Cross and Charleson are supported by a well-choosen cast that includes a few familiar faces - the late John Gielgud, Lindsay Anderson, and Ian Holm. The one who plays a crucial role is Holm, who portrays Sam Mussabini, a seasoned veteran coach who helps Harold (Cross) prepare for the track and field events.<br/><br/>And the characters in this story make a portion of the movie somewhat interesting.  The musical score by Vangelis, which sounds clear and doesn't goes for over-the-top, is still priceless.  Besides the score, director Hugh Hudson's careful direction adds another element and makes the film even more appealing.  ""Chariots of Fire"" is a key testment of the human spirit."

","When the opening notes of Vangelis's iconic theme appeared in the very first scene of 1981's Chariots of Fire, I knew we were in for something special when I felt chills going down my spine. I put this movie in the echelon of great films because this movie meant so much and by the end, I had tears rolling down my cheek as I sat in stunned silence mesmerized by what I saw. People view the movie as a sports film, but it is way more than that. The movie is set with running in the 1924 Olympics, but it takes it on in a more spiritual, inspirational way. It is about the drive and determination of what it takes to be the very best. The two main runners portrayed-Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams want to win for different, inspirational reasons and not because they want to be the best runners in the world (although they were).<br/><br/>Director Hugh Hudson and producer David Puttnam when through painstaking research and casting to make this movie the way it is. Puttnam wanted to create an inspirational story in the veins of 1966's The Man of All Seasons and thought something in the world of sports would allow him to do so. He randomly stumbled upon the story of Eric Liddell (yes, this a true authentic story) and immediately knew this was the story he wanted to tell.<br/><br/>The movie begins after the end of the first World War. It focuses on two very fast runners-Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross). Harold is a Lithuanian Jew and he leads a decent life at Cambridge. But he lives in a society that is rather anti-Semitic. He uses his speed to show the world his worth and to prove Jewish people are not the people the world makes them out to be. Eric, son of Christian missionaries, was born in China. He is a devout member of the Church of Scotland and wants to use his gift of speed as a way to spread the word of God. Their lives will intersect at the 1924 Olympics where they will be faced with the ultimate test with the Americans Jackson Scholz (Brad Davis) and Charles Paddock (Dennis Christopher), each other, and themselves.<br/><br/>The casting is ingenious. Hudson and Puttnam wanted to have a cast with unknown actors in the leading roles surrounded by a well-known supporting cast, and does it ever work! Ian Charleson was discovered in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of Piaf. Cross was seen in the play Chicago and they really loved his musical talent. Surrounding these two leads, noticeable standouts are Ian Holm as Abraham's running coach, Sam Mussabini, Sir John Gielgud in a more glorified cameo as a master of Cambridge college, and Nigel Havers as Lord Andrew Lindsay. Ian Holm gave the more emotional performance and he dominated every scene he was in. The one scene where he celebrates a victory after 30 years in the business and not being allowed in the Olympic Stadium because he was a Jew swallowed me up with emotion.<br/><br/>I really liked how the movie is not preachy. Yes, the movie is enveloped in spiritual themes, but it doesn't whack you on the head consistently with these themes and that made the movie more accessible for the mainstream audience. That said, faith and inspiration play major roles in the movie because they are the basic foundations of why these men choose to run. The movie is also a British film, and it does have some sharp messages against the British class system. There is also a very strong message against anti-Semitism. If you are expecting a historical accurate film, you may need to look elsewhere. Hudson took some liberties creating this movie. He wanted to give the main characters more time together despite their paths briefly intersecting with each other in reality.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is a tour-de-force movie that you will not forget. From the moment the film began with the iconic scene of the runners on the beach running to Vangelis's masterful, haunting score, you know this is something special, something inspirational. Vangelis really created one of the most well-known musical scores of all time and it successfully establishes the tone of the movie. Running is not my favorite sport, but I came to care for these characters. I came to share in their emotions of joy, stress, defeat, inspiration, and glory. Instead of a paint-by-numbers about running, we get a movie that shows the best of human nature. The winner of 4 Oscars, including Best Picture, this movie is bound to give you inspiration if you need some! I certainly did!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

Abraham is Jewish in a softly anti-semitic world runs because he wants to prove to himself and to other people that he is the best, Liddle is deeply religious and wishes to win to honour the gift he was given by God.<br/><br/>Do not expect an American style fast moving action filled plot, but if you like films that stir your emotions, make you engage with the characters and make you feel a better person at the end, this is the one for you.<br/><br/>Well deserved Oscar."
"g-white723","8","1","1","7 October 2015"," Nostalgic, Nationalistic Film about Sporting Ethics
","The name of this film Chariots of Fire is also a line from a famous poem / hymn called Jerusalem. It is treated as a national anthem amongst many in England. This film taps into nationalistic pride of winning in sport while conveying a subtle message that the ethics of the Olympic Games are lost in the pursuit of success.<br/><br/>Two sportsmen from a bygone era Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson)are rivals for the gold medal sprint at the Paris Olympic Games. Both are incredibly talented but very different personalities even though they are both outsiders in the society they live in. Abrahams is the son of a migrant Jew who is studying Law at Cambridge and feels out of place amongst the establishment he so detests, while Liddell is also a foreigner in his own land as he was born the son of a missionary in China and he is now back in Scotland but his religious views are seen as a bit odd.<br/><br/>This film is based on real life people and an extraordinary situation which occurred in 1924. These guys ran in a different era when amateurism was the right way to compete, and Christian values were still relevant to a lot of people. Abrahams is unashamed ambitious and just wants to be the best and win for himself and his country and university. Liddell is also ambitious, but his religious activities with the missionary interferes with his goals, but he is convinced by his father that running in the name of God is honourable.<br/><br/>There is an exploration of what motivates athletes, how to take defeat and how to run a straight race which is quite interesting. There also some other athletes in the group - Nigel Havers plays Lord Linsey who is competing in the hurdles. He brings another angle to the film as a true sportsman who just loves taking part. He plays a crucial role near the end of the film.<br/><br/>There are good performances from the lead actors, and I thought the sporting action looked realistic while keeping the period details very well. The Vangelis music score is another major reason to like this film. There are some cheesy moments of athletes back slapping each other and pompous speeches about God King and Country, but on the whole this is an interesting movie - 8/10"
"goreilly40","8","1","1","20 June 2015"," Great movie, however......
","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, the stories of the two athletes Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddel are captivating, both having to make extreme sacrifices often at their own personal expense. The tension in the build up to the final races could be felt while watching it, particularly the 100 meters when the finalists are getting ready in the changing room. Although it was a real shame to see another Cambridge athlete Douglas Lowe who won gold in the 800 meters refused to be involved in the film. Also as a sports fan, I was disappointed that the main star of the 1924 Olympics was not even mentioned, the Phantom Finn Paavo Nurmi, who astonishingly won the 1500 and the 5000 meters within one hour of each other, setting Olympic records in both events, and Ville Ritola who also did a double of his own the steeplechase and the 10,000 meters while finishing second behind Nurmi in the 5000 meters. Bit of a mistake excluding the Flying Finns but as this movie was about British athletes, maybe that's why we only saw glimpses of them dominating their events during Eric Liddel's monologue when we see the Cambridge athletes struggling to compete. Anyway exclusions aside this movie is well worth a watch, its inspirational and it shows if your willing to work for something you can achieve anything if you set your mind to it."
"brchthethird","7","1","1","7 March 2015"," More intriguing as a dual character study than as a sports drama
","Continuing my streak of past Best Picture winners, I took the opportunity to watch (for the first time) CHARIOTS OF FIRE. While it's about as unchallenging and ""white bread"" as you can get for this type of fare, it still remains an inspirational sports drama and character study that explores the reasons behind wanting to achieve greatness. The two points of comparison are Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the former a British Jew and the latter a Scottish Christian. Both have intensely personal reasons for wanting to win the gold in the 1924 Olympics. Harold is in it for personal achievement as a way to transcend the anti-Semitism he experiences, while Eric runs for God. Although the film sets them up as rivals, they only ever compete against each other once, and not in the Olympics (they are in separate events). This actually works in the film's favor, though, as this allows the audience to root for the success of both. It goes without saying that the acting is all top-notch, and the cast contains a who's-who of famous British actors. Aside from the two leads, you have John Gielgud and Ian Holm in supporting roles as the Master of Trinity and Harold's coach, respectively. Then there's the iconic theme by Vangelis which is certain to inspire you. Even if this film isn't too well remembered, the theme music is, and it's one of the most stirring ever composed. There is also the excellent use of slow motion during the racing scenes. Although it's been parodied and spoofed dozens of times since, here it remains free of irony and is a brilliant way to showcase the physical form of the competitors. The only thing I can think of that really dampens the experience is how simplistic and ""safe"" the film is. It's not really a surprise that the Academy chose it as the Best Picture for its year, but it could have explored its themes of patriotism and spirituality with a little more depth. The story itself was also very predictable (as sports dramas often are) and its resolution a foregone conclusion. Still, what really makes the film worth watching is what happens in between, the journey to the Olympics that its two leads embark upon. Overall, it's not necessarily the best sports movie I've ever seen (nor the most memorable), but it's a wholesome and endearing film that should appeal to all ages."

Though unfortunately for Abrahams every time he runs the track with Liddel he takes the first few losses not very seriously until the most recent time he lost to Liddel there was a scene where he was sitting on a chair in the stadium wallowing in self pity thinking that Liddel may be ""a little too competitive"" and his girlfriend is trying to help him out and he hires a pro training coach named Sam Mussabini (played by Ian Holm in an Oscar nominated performance) whose character reminds me of the boxing manager Mickey Goldmill in the first few Rocky movies. though this movie is unlike all the sports movies that I have seen but it has one thing in common with all the ones I watched and liked that all of them were inspirational works like Raging bull (1980), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Cinderella Man (2005), the Pride of the Yankess (1942), Remember the Titans (2000) etc. The thing about this film was the neatest part to me was the fact that every track running scene all the runners were moving in slow-motion, as well as the classical score that made me get a lot more involved in the story to this movie. In this film there were a few other great supporting performances besides the Ian Holm performance but as well as by the legendary John Gielgud as the master of trinity, Lindsay Anderson as the master of Caius, as well as the second greatest supporting performance of the entire film was by Brad Davis as an American track runner named Jackson Scholz. This film is very profound but to me it didn't deserve the Academy award for best picture as much as Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark which was nominated alongside this film, but I still enjoyed it, and I really do think it is one of the best movies of 1981."

","This is a great depiction of a true story of Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) two British track athletes competing in the 1924 Olympic games. Harold is Jewish and Eric is Christian. As the film goes on we see Harold and Eric win their respective races as they become closer friends. Win they are put into a race together we see that the have a sense of competition towards one another but they soon realize how close they are. The film focuses on these two people mostly and their lives behind them. Eric is a soon to be missionary who is running the race because he wants to please God, and Harold is running to overcome anti-Semitism. It's a very good depiction and the acting is also quite good. I like it a lot mostly because I run cross country for my high school. I recommend it and give it 8 stars out of 10."

","I think most people know ""Chariots of Fire"" because of the opening scene, in which runners cross the beach in slow-motion while Vangelis' famous theme song plays in the background. <br/><br/>""Chariots of Fire"" tells the story of Harold Abrahams, an Englishman of Jewish origins that seems to have a good life. He studies in the best university of England, he has good friends, and he is in love with a beautiful soprano. But above all he loves running and is very good at this. Yet something worries him: people discriminate him for his Jewish origins, especially the Masters of the University, and he wants to compete in the Olympics to overcome this. <br/><br/>The second main character in the movie is Eric Lidell, a Scottish student, member of the Reformed Catholic Church, who is a nice person and a great preacher. Eric loves running and similar to Harold he competes in local races and always wins. But his sister thinks he is more concerned in running than in serving to God and she wants he go with his family in a mission to China. Eric also wants to go but he thinks God made him an excellent runner, and now he wants to run in his name at the Olympic Games.<br/><br/>This is not a religious movie though. It is a movie about honor, sportsmanship and glory. It is about two men who love running and want to prove something by doing it. Two men who have different beliefs and belong to different social classes and want to overcome their difficulties by winning at the Olympic Games. The acting is good (especially Ian Holm as Harold's trainer), the score (with his synthesizer music) is memorable, and the movie is well-written and directed. It also presents some critiques to the British social class system and shows the courage of these men who tried to defend their beliefs and achieved the glory, not just for their nation but for themselves.<br/><br/>Summarizing, ""Chariots of Fire"" is not a perfect movie and sometimes it feels generic in respect to others sports movies, but all flaws aside it represents a very moving and inspiring picture. <br/><br/>My Score: 8.4"

","""Nazi art is both prurient and idealising. Its aesthetic (physical perfection, identity as a biological given etc) implies an ideal eroticism: sexuality converted into the magnetism of leaders and the joy of followers. The fascist ideal is to transform sexual energy into a ""spiritual"" force; pinups who are both sanctimoniously asexual and (in a technical sense) pornographic, for they have the perfection of a fantasy."" - Susan Sontag <br/><br/>Hugh Hudson directs ""Chariots of Fire"". The plot? Ben Cross plays Harold Abrahams, a Jewish student at Cambridge University. Harold faces anti-Semitic and class based persecution, but overcomes these through much hard work and tenacity. Eventually Harold becomes a star sprinter who wins a chance to participate in the upcoming, 1924 Olympic games, held in Paris. Alongside Harold is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian who sees running as a means of both exalting God and professing his faith. He too qualifies for the Olympic Games. On route to the event, Eric learns that his race will be taking place on the Sabbath. Not wishing to ""offend God"", Eric refuses to run. The Prince of Wales contacts Eric and pleads with him to change his stance, but Eric remains steadfast. The world rallies behind Eric, celebrating his unwavering principles. Eric later signs up for a longer, 400 meter race, which takes place after the Sabbath. He unexpectedly wins. Harold likewise wins his race. We applaud our underdog heroes.<br/><br/>A box-office smash and ""classic of British cinema"", ""Chariots of Fire's"" content and intent, subtext and text are in constant opposition. The film pretends to celebrate the downtrodden, the persecuted, the merit of ideals, personal beliefs and courage, but espouses Victorian values, religious fundamentalism and revolves around a couple of heroes who exist to curry the favour of a glorified patrician class.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, ""Chariots"" was released at a time when faith in the nation state was at a remarkable low. With millions unemployed, riots in the streets, deep financial recessions and a dwindling faith in British power/prestige, ""Chariots"" rekindled a kind of manic patriotism; a fervent pride in all things Britannia. No matter that an arch conservative Prime Minister (Margaret Thatcher) was gearing up for a needless war with the Falklands (a royal Wedding occurred over the summer, boosting nationalist ecstasy), privatising away the country and kicking millions out of jobs. No, now was a time for the masses to feel good about themselves again, dig deep and hanker nostalgically for the Empire's past glories. The film's so sinisterly sexy you feel like wrapping yourself up in a Union Jack, running naked down Brighton Breach and dry-humping Lord Nelson's column all at once.<br/><br/>So though presented as figures who ""revolt against the establishment"", Harold and Eric do something completely else, championing elitism, competition and aristocratic national/religious traditions. The film pretends to be about an oppressive, class-ridden 1920s England, but hungers for elitism. Significantly, most of the film is bathed in xenophobic jeers, digs at other nationalities and French bashing. Elsewhere the director puts the worst anti-Semitic remarks in the mouths of disabled working-class veterans. Liddel and Abrahams may seem to revolt against a certain order (or triumph despite it), but they exemplify its traditions and values above anyone else in the film. In fact, Liddel is too conservative even for the aristocracy; he believes in God above country, a much more archaic allegiance. And however much Abrahams complains, he still desires more than anything to become part of the aristocracy he supposedly despises.<br/><br/>Leni Riefenstahl, the poster girl for fascist art, released the visually spectacular ""Olympia"" in 1938. ""Chariot's"" own aesthetic appropriates the fascist chic of Riefenstahl's films/photographs, salivating over Ubermenschian bodies whilst oozing a Wagnerian physicality, mixed with a little romanticised ""Triumph of the Wills"" styled muscle porn. This is designed to stir up the audience's basest, most knee-jerk nationalism (Thatcher would use the film to rally support for her Falkland War), but it's also positively riveting; like an art house ""Rocky"" movie (complete with cranky old mentor and simple ""be all you can be/make your dreams come true"" plot), only with less skin and more stiff upper lips. Much of the film consists of powerful slow motion shots of running men, hordes of chanting onlookers and pulsating muscles set to a now iconic Vangelis score. Vangelis' electro-synth orchestrals are the film's big stroke of genius, the composer's music oddly juxtaposed to the film's more primitive values/aesthetic (though some say Vangelis' Wagner inspired tunes are themselves retro).<br/><br/>""Chariots"" was based on a true story, but changed a number of subtle things in order to bolster its underdog tale. In real life Abrahams did not identify with Judaism, eventually became a Cacholic, was a boozer, was not a determined workaholic, had no aspirations toward winning a gold medal, his wealth ensured him a privileged position in English society and he did not have to struggle against prejudice to gain Cambridge admission. In Eric's case, he long knew his race was to be held on the Sabbath, no meetings with the Prince of Wales took place, and the international public were behind the Brits and booed the Americans, the reverse of what Hudson's film shows. And while the film portrays 1920s Britain as a hotbed of anti-Semitism, such feelings were consigned to a few areas of the establishment. It was Britain's rulers who hated Jews (not the working class), as it associated them with the Marxism with sought the destruction of class-exploitation and aristocracy. Elsewhere Parliament was mobilising plans to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine. <br/><br/>Still, you want Wagnerian slow-motion shots of Vangelis sprinkled ubermensch goodness? ""Chariots of Fire"" delivers. Balboa would be proud.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing."

","Tonight I needed to watch (for the umpteenth time) the DVD of the 1981 masterpiece set within the framework of the 1924 Olympics. I needed the boost of the age-31 NYC memory of the phrase, ""...with hope in our hearts and wings on our heels."" In those Manhattan days we hopeful entrepreneurs were running pretty fast. With the London Olympics underway, there are many modern-day and just-in-time messages embedded in this tried-and-true story about character, ethics, morals, motivation and mystery. It is fascinating to observe the film's navigation of philosophies of Church of Scotland (Presbyterian), Church of England (Anglican/Episcopalian), and Jewish faith traditions.

","I first saw this when it was released in theaters 30 years ago. Watching it again, I was struck how beautiful the film was, from the musical score, the costuming, and the location, all capturing well, the feel of Cambridge, England in the 1920's. The framing, use of slow motion and the colors are top notch. The acting, superb. This time around, I noticed the contrasting characters of the driven and confident Harold Abrams, and the humble Eric Liddle maintaining his integrity and faithfulness, yet both arriving at their goals via differing routes. The film stands out even more so now against the steady stream of mass produced Hollywood movies with all the blockbuster names and special effects do not come close to touching the heart and soul of a work of art like this film. It is a bit slow and requires the viewer to invest some focus and attention rather than be entertained, but the reward in the end is that much greater."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","1","1","25 November 2011"," Perfection!
","Rarely times a film offered such a complete and rich view of what being an athlete means than ""Chariots of Fire"". This outstanding Best Picture Oscar winner deals not only with that but also brings incredibly good insights on how different religions peacefully work together for the same cause, which is running, not just to the extent of winning a medal and being recognized but also showing how God helps them. Right, there's some rivalry between a Catholic and a Jewish but they know how to tolerate each other without getting into a fist fight. And more, all of this happened during the Olympic games of 1924. More inspiring to our lives than that I don't know.<br/><br/>In those quiet and foggy days, there was a group of runners running on a beach training their bodies and minds to a cause, to get closer to God on a search for perfection, that's what running did for them or at least that's the way they saw it: to make heart and soul united in a magnificent and joyful experience that was more interesting than to run for their college or their countries while competing; those were good reasons but to run for God was the noblest of all. They were the chariots of fire!<br/><br/>As main characters of this adventure we have these two athletes: the preacher Eric Lidell (Ian Charleson, remarkable), a zealous Catholic and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish student at Cambridge. Of course, there are other characters but those two and the trainer Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) are the ones you really pay great attention for the way they share their views on life and athletics, their personal efforts in overcoming obstacles e.g. the ones involving Abrahams dealing with lots of Anti-Semitism at college trying to make his way through life.<br/><br/>I know there isn't such thing as a perfect film but this one gets closer to that in terms of composition, Colin Welland's script, Milena Canonero's costumes, the art direction, everything works! But the ones that deserve extra credit are the wonderful music composed by Vangelis and the acting by the cast. The music, a piece executed with lots of synthesizers, is very contemporary for a story that takes place in the 1920's but somehow perfectly fits the film, and now has an enormous cultural impact (whenever you hear that song you remember marathons, athletics and all. Sadly, most people know that the song comes from this film but they never watched it). And we have the excellent and very believable performances from the actors who play the runners (including Nigel Havers, Dennis Christopher and Brad Davis) with Charleson and Cross giving the best of the show. A great achievement by director Hugh Hudson, who after that haven't got much luck with his next projects. <br/><br/>It took me a long time to fully appreciate ""Chariots of Fire"", its messages and its magnificence. A bit overrated (""Reds"" was the best picture that year and should've won the Oscar) but indeed a powerful work to make you marveled. To those who gave up on this film at one time I suggest to give it another chance because this is one that can only be really understood with time and with the experiences you have in life. Liking sport films or not, this is really a must see. 10/10"
"zardoz-13","Null","1","1","28 September 2011"," The Top Sports Film of the 1980s
","Hugh Hudson's ""Chariots of Fire"" ranks as the inspirational sports film of the 1980s. Ironically, this Oscar winning epic literally came out of nowhere, according to its director, with its line-up of freshman actors and its small $5-million budget. On the DVD commentary track, Hudson states that the theme of the film is faith. This biographical opus about the 1924 Paris Olympics and the British running team that captured several Medals focuses largely on Scotsman Eric Liddell and Jewish Harold Abrahams as they tangle with intolerance all the way to the top. Ben Cross is terrific as the strident Abrahams and the film opens with a memorial service to him in an English church. Although Eric Liddel did not face the prejudice that Abrahams had to endure, he created problems with his decision to keep the Sabbath and refuse to run the 100 meters heat on a Sunday. Liddell is a Christian missionary at Cambridge and he has trouble with his naïve sister Jeanie who wants him to forsake running for his service to God and often scolds him for letting his desire to run interfere with the Lord's business. Finally, Eric has to explain to his dutiful sister that he cannot hold in contempt what God has given him. ""Chariots of Fire"" is all about champions and the price that they are willing to pay to be triumphant in the end. Brad Davis of ""The Midnight Express"" and Dennis Christopher of ""Breaking Away"" co-star along with the impressive Nigel Davenport. You will never forget Vangelis' memorable Oscar-winning musical score."

","""The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."" Pierre de Coubertin (1863-1937)<br/><br/>I expected the 1981 Best Picture, Hugh Hudson's ""Chariots of Fire"", to be a glorious illustration of this quotation from the father of Modern Olympics. How wrong I was. On the contrary, ""Chariots of Fire"" is the flamboyant depiction of the heart-burning thirst for victory and self-achievement through a thought-provoking, never cynical and always sincere, Oscar-winning script.<br/><br/>The film opens with the eulogy of one of the greatest British athletes, Harold Abrahams, and then the image directly fades to the movie's most emblematic scene and probably one of the most iconic opening sequences from any film, the slow-motion beach running. This part is driven by Vangelis' inspirational score that perfectly matches the film's spirit, like ""Midnight Express"" or ""High Noon""'s theme. Maybe I speak for myself, but when I watched the film for the first time, I thought ""Oh, so that's where this music comes from!"" Rarely had the iconic status of a film preceded its knowledge, and ""Chariots of Fire"" is one of the few, that features recognizable elements even before being watched.<br/><br/>Ironically, the opening scene can be as misleading as Coubertin's line, conveying the inspirational aspect of sports as a necessary team-spirit builder while in fact, the runners are less a team than a group of individuals who run for distinct reasons. Looking at them gives some early hints about their personal conceptions regarding sport. Harold Abrahams is concentrated, he doesn't smile, totally absorbed by a dream of victory which in his eyes, looks like a matter of life and death. Eric Liddel is like carried by the wind, in a sort of symbiosis with an invisible power. And Andrew Lindsay has a touching childish smile, wiping sand from his mouth, exuding a genuine positivity that three letters can eloquently summarize : fun.<br/><br/>Sport in ""Chariots of Fire"" is only the medium used to express something much deeper made palpable by the script. We all have different reasons to enjoy or to be passionate and the point is not whether these reasons are good or not, but if we can remain faithful to them. What could have been –and I don't mean that in a pejorative way– a ""Rocky"" in a stadium, became a formidable lesson of integrity, through the two pillar characters Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddel, two prodigious, two different athletes, but whose extraordinary attachment to personal values and principles allowed them to fulfill their dreams. And this is the 'something more' I was evoking. ""Chariots of Fire"" is not about going the distance, about winning, but about integrity.<br/><br/>Harold Abrahams is a young Cambridge student whose Jewish ethnicity cemented a strong feeling of being an outsider, despite his brilliant education and undeniable patriotism. He seems to be the only one to really take it personally but the point is not to judge if Harold is right or wrong to feel that way, but to realize how this built his ferocious ambition to win, even leading him to hire a professional coach when the philosophy of the Olympic Games idealized the amateur sportsmanship. Harold runs less for winning than against the insupportable idea of losing, because his ethnicity can't allow him to be ordinary. His passion is the euphemism for an ego-driven ambition, destined to honor his heritage. Coubertin's spirit is one thing but don't we most often remember the name of the winner, don't we say : may the best win? <br/><br/>""God made me for a purpose. But he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure."" This is from Eric Liddel, the son of Scottish missionaries established in China, a man who abandoned rugby for religion, until put in recurrent situations that proved him how running was part of his destiny. According to Liddel, the best way to honor God, is to honor His gift. The movie could be taken as a pro-religious film, which is not, if you listen carefully (another credit to the Oscar winning script), this declaration to his sister echoes Cambridge's Master of Trinity opening speech inviting the young students to find their own paths and never let people influence them. This is what having principles is about, an idea illustrated by the issue concerning Eric's refusal to run during the Sabbath Day. It's good to have beliefs that inspire a passion, as long as the passion doesn't encourage you to deny these beliefs. Integrity is the ultimate victory, and compromising is the terrible admittance of defeat.<br/><br/>Whether it's for God, for ego or for fun, the movie is an extraordinary introspection into these abstractions that inspire the best from us, it's not about medals, about speeches, but it's the whole feeling of having accomplished whatever we feel born for. The most poignant moment of the film is when Harold's coach, Ian Holm as the scene-stealer Mussabini, pierces the top of his hat while hearing 'God Save the Queen' and understands that Harold won, his ""My Son"" is a personal appropriation of Harold's merit. Victory is not an end but a mean, and only the cheers and applauds at the end remind us that the mission of sportsmen is also to both impress and inspire people, through a mutual sentiment of pride. And that the movie is set between two devastating World Wars, is not coincidental, for Sport is still the greatest affirmation of human spirit and war, its polar opposite.<br/><br/>""Chariots of Fire"" is an inspirational masterpiece, inviting us to find the little spark that will inspire us to achieve ourselves, to fulfill our dreams, with patience and perseverance, a patience forever incarnated by the iconic slow-motion running on the beach, through Vangelis' divine score"

","Once in a while there is a rare jewel that emerges from the Hollywood scene; Chariots of Fire is one of these fine films.<br/><br/>My interest in seeing this film arose from my interest in Eric Liddell, one of the main protagonists in the story.He was a man of high character who lived to serve others and not for his own fame or prestige. <br/><br/>What makes this movie even more appealing is that it is based on a true story. In fact, I was able to teach English in the same city in China (Tianjin) where Eric served as a teacher before he was interned in a Japanese prison camp (there is now a plaque in front of his former residence in Tianjin).<br/><br/>Based on the biographies/testimonials I've read about Eric Liddell, the performance of Ian Charleson as Liddell is very accurate (he even mimics Eric's running unique running style, with his head thrown back in the air running with all his might).<br/><br/>However, although Liddell indeed refused to compromise his conviction regarding the Sabbath day,(as portrayed extremely well by Charleson in the film) I never came across anything that would lead me to believe that Liddell pushed his beliefs on anyone else (as shown when he ""chides"" the child for playing football on a Sunday near the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>Even if one is not as interested in Liddell as I am, it is still an excellent film, and very inspirational. The music and visuals in the film are also extremely appealing.<br/><br/>Some viewers who are keen on films with fast moving plots or action may find this movie a bit slow at times. However, I would recommend Chariots of Fire to anyone who appreciates fine films with intriguing plots and characters. <br/><br/>Overall an excellent film: 9/10"

","When I was attending my Young Leaders National Day in Australia, they showed some random clips from films about leadership and always following your dreams. They showed movie clips from Over The Hedge, Up, and, of course, Chariots Of Fire. I would have never bothered watching this if it wasn't for everyone claiming that they had watched it and it made feel like the odd one out. The clip showed the part where Eric Liddell confesses to his sister that God made him to run. That scene was memorable and was so intriguing even if it was only one or two minutes long. My local library, luckily, kept a copy aside for me and I couldn't wait to watch this MASTERPIECE. I was ready to face anything but somewhere I knew that this movie wasn't meant for me. First of all, it was made thirty or so years ago and films that long ago don't appeal to me as much as the new ones. Second of all, I was prepared to be bored out of my mind by listening to all that British accents being portrayed and the boring plot. Third of all, I had no history of what the story was about and that, surprisingly, made the film feel more intriguing. The competition between Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams is very fun to watch and since I hardly know anything about them, you won't know who is going to win. At times you are rooting for Eric Liddell and his fast legs but the majority of the time, my attention was focused on Harold Abrahams because he is more likable and way more determined that Eric Liddell. The beginning creates a sense of nostalgia as you see either Eric Or Harold, maybe one of their friends, half-narrating the story which you will watch. The story starts as a bunch of runners are running on the beach dressed in plain white-clothes. That was a perfect background for the credits to be portrayed in. Even though the film is more than thirty years old, it felt like something made in the nineties and that's a bad thing. The date which it is set in doesn't even feel like it is the right time. It looks too futuristic for the date it was set in. Ben Cross is lovable as Harold Abrahams and he is fantastic in this picture. I guarantee you no one can play Harold better than him. I was very surprised that the film won four Oscars but none went to anyone, except a nomination for Ian Holme. Ben Cross should have truly won an Oscar or, at least, a nomination for his notable performance. Ian Charleson was fine not to win an Oscar but if it wasn't for his death, I am pretty sure he would be having an Oscar held in his hand right round. I can't say if he portrayed Eric Liddell beautifully since I don't even know how he was but if he was something like this in the film, I am sure he would've been proud of him. Ian Holme came to be quite a surprise for his performance of Sam Mussabini, the coach of Harold Abrahams, and he is hardly recognizable. He was the coach that everyone wishes they had. The award for Costume Design was earned well because the costumes filled in a lot of its time.<br/><br/>The story, told in flashback, of two young British sprinters competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics. Eric, a devout Scottish missionary runs because he knows it must please God. Harold, the son of a newly rich Jew runs to prove his place in Cambridge society. In a warmup 100 meter race, Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro trainer to prepare him. Eric, whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, refuses to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee. A compromise is reached when a nobleman allows Eric to compete in his 400 meter slot. Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman/athletic advocate, respectively.<br/><br/>The moments where the film, literally, speed up or are filled with adrenaline are the best moments you will find in the film. The college race is memorable and contains a vague sense of nostalgia. The race is a race worth shouting for in approval, matter of fact every race in his film deserves your respect and more importantly, your valuable time. The Olympic races were tense and exhilarating, just the way I like it, and, surprisingly, I jumped out of my couch a lot of the time, to clap or shout "" You can do it Harold! Yes, Harold! Good!"". The music is ear catching and body moving. The film also contains, I think, some native British songs like ""He is an Englishman"" and many more. The music is great to hear but the title of the song is very hard to remember. The music is most of the time Christian themed. I highly recommend this film to anyone and I can't seem to understand why people do not like this movie. It contains of the best stories that are centered around the Olympics. Chariots Of Fire - there isn't a film like this nor will there ever be."

","Chariots Of Fire charts the path of two young British runners, Eric Liddell & Harold Abrahams, both of whom differ greatly in motivation, to the Olympic Games in Paris 1924.<br/><br/>Produced by David Puttnam, directed by Hugh Hudson, written by Colin Welland and sublimely scored by Vangelis. Chariots Of Fire was the winner of four Academy Awards for 1981, best film, best screenplay, best score and best costume. It was also nominated in three other categories, director, supporting actor {Ian Holm} and editing. It's with the Academy Awards that a lot of Chariots Of Fire's aura, for better and worse, exists. What most assuredly is a inspirational true tale period piece, seems to suffer for being named the finest picture of its particular year. It's as if it's just not cool to say a film such as this is fashionable. Shame, because although it's far from being an across the board masterpiece, it certainly doesn't deserve some of the nonsensical mud that has been thrown at it over the years.<br/><br/>We open with what has now become an almost legendary sequence of slow motion athletes running thru the surf, accompanied by Vangelis' beautiful score. We then follow the dovetailing Liddell and Abrahams on their paths to destiny. Liddell {Ian Charleson} is a devout Christian, he runs for God, but this throws up a problem as racing is scheduled for a Sunday and Liddell simply will not race on that day. Abrahams {Ben Cross} is Jewish, he races out of a need to be accepted, the need to win eating away at him as he strives to fight off prejudice.<br/><br/>This is no blinking boring sports period piece, this is, within its sport framework, a film about identity and beliefs. Charleson and Cross are both excellent because they give the characters a grounded reality, essential since this is a true story not glossed up by artistic licence. Backing them up is the nominated Holm, Nigel Havers, Nicholas Farrell, John Gielgud and impressive turns from the ladies, Cheryl Campbell & Alice Krige. Hudson gives his film a grandeur befitting the outcome, with his race sequences particularly memorable and easy on the eye. A fine film indeed, one that not only left myself feeling suitably learned about two very interesting men, but also left me feeling a sense of exhilaration as well. 8/10"
"Eumenides_0","8","1","1","11 April 2009"," A Great Feel Good Movie
","Chariots of Fire is a simple, feel-good movie. It certainly won't make into the cinema history books. Technically speaking, it's average. Director Hugh Hudson has a firm understanding of how to shoot a scene. The screenplay by Colin Welland is possibly the best aspect of the movie. With the help of a great cast - Ian Holm and Ian Charleson deserve special credit for their performances - this is a well-accomplished drama about a group of athletes competing in the 1924 Olympics.<br/><br/>The conflict here is between Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Cahrleson). Harold is a Jew who finds in sports a way of fighting against racial oppression. Eric is a priest who believes God has given him the gift of running and so he runs to honor him. Each character is fascinating. Each has a good reason to run, and the screenplay explores how their passion affects their personal lives. Harold is obsessed to the point he ignores everything else, including love and friends. Eric wonders whether he's not putting his personal glory before God's.<br/><br/>Ian Holm plays Sam Mussabini, a trainer who prepares Harold for the Olympics. One of the best aspects of the movie are the running montages. Editor Terry Rawlings crafts each montage in a different way. Especially good are the opening titles of the British team running on the beach, an iconic sequence, and the training montage which shows the distinct way Harold and Eric train. Harold is a methodical man, he has a scientific approach, a personal trainer. But Eric simply runs on the high hills of Scotland, like a possessed man, showing his communion with God.<br/><br/>Vangelis' classic score can't be ignored either. You'd think a synth-heavy score would be unsuitable for a period movie, but it's one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever created for cinema.<br/><br/>In the end, Chariots of Fire is a movie made to leave people satisfied. Only an insensitive won't cheer at the triumphs of everyone in this movie. Watch it and rejoice."

","I write this comment on a wet,dark November morning in Cambridge.Through my window the roof of Gonville and Caius' Master's Lodge is slick with the drizzly rain,and I can imagine the shade of Harold Abrahams - one of it's most notable alumni - running down Senate House passage,laughing,half - hidden under his umbrella,a girl on each arm. In 1924 the University was far more an elitist establishment than it is now,and Abrahams may well have considered himself something of an outsider but most of his fellow students were far too well brought up to be impolite to him.An added bonus would have been that he was rather good - looking and - obviously - a top class athlete. When he ""Beat the clock"" in the race round the Great Court at Trinity College it further boosted his popularity amongst his peers. Incidentally Lord Coe,head of London's bid for the 2012 Olympics,pulled off the same feat 40 - odd years later. In ""Chariots of fire"" we are not seeing a cross - section of British society in the early 1920s.The Amateur code dominated sport.Professionalism was a dirty word.In cricket there were Gentlemen and there were Players(Professionals).I remember going to Gentlemen vs Players matches in Surrey as late as the 1940s,the old values were dying hard.The Professionals were almost exclusively working class who had been excluded from athletics at its highest level because of the predominance of the Gentleman Amateur.Men like Abrahams,Liddell and the fictional Lord Lindsay. The Corinthian Spirit was abroad.To compete was an honour in itself. No drugs,no food supplements,no ""Athletics Scholarships"",no Lottery Money.No cheating.Just endeavour and sportsmanship.How quaint that all may seem after the most expensive Olympic Games in history where the nation's gamblers funded ""Team GB"" to success on a raft of money. And yet.......to me there is something eternally appealing and very British about the cult of the gifted amateur in an era when everybody is obsessed with ""winning"" and athletes can become millionaires overnight and consider silver medals an insult. ""Chariots of fire"",happily,does not concern itself with such heresy. It is a wonderful evocation of the complex social mores of Upper Class British life in the immediate post World War One era when the Donkeys who had led the Lions on the battlefields of Europe were having one hell of a last hurrah before bending their knees to the inevitability of history. It may not contain enough cheery cockneys and canny northerners to satisfy some people but to have done so in such a context would have been a distortion of the facts.Their time was to come. Instead it features a class whose values and moral code was on the verge of extinction.And that was not,arguably,a cause for celebration."

","I have been meaning to see this for over 3 years and yesterday I finally got to see what all the fuss was about. Chariots of Fire was the surprise winner of 1981, up against Reds and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Based on the true story of British athletes preparing for the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. Surprisingly enough this was Hugh Hudson's directorial debut and that is very impressive. His direction fits the film perfectly, it takes us back to the 20's and it feels genuine. The score is incredibly moving and has been used and parodied so much know everyone is bound to have heard it. The actors look the part but in terms of the actual acting, there is something lacking that really prevents the film from perfection.<br/><br/>Ian Holm, Ian Charleson (who plays Eric Liddel) and Alice Krige are superb in their roles but I find that Ben Cross (who plays Harold Abrahams) and Cheryl Campbell don't give powerful enough performances to lift their characters which is a shame as they are vital to the story.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie as good as it is is the perfect use of music and the beauty of the story. It is extremely inspiration and moving, especially the ending. Chariots of Fire is definitely deserving of its Oscar and a must-see for everyone.<br/><br/>4/5"

","I was finally able to see this film.  It has played on tv many times over the years, but I avoided seeing it because I thought it would be too boring. So I decided to rent the video.  On the first viewing, I thought: this is such a BORING movie!  I wasn't really paying attention to it while it was playing, because I thought it was too boring.  But I decided to see it again the next day, and I realized what a really good movie this is.  It's a story about two men from two very different backgrounds, and each one has his unique reason for wanting to win at the 1924 Olympics; yet, there are obstacles that they must face that may prevent them from reaching their goal.  This is a touching film, though it's not a tearjerker in any way.  In fact, it has a happy ending.  I especially liked the electronic music score used in the film....considering the fact that this is a period film, the electronic score gave the film a unique touch.  It's interesting, the score has become one of the best known and most liked film scores in history.  On another note, a film like this one is almost a relic nowadays.  I personally liked this film (after seeing it a second time).  I thought it was a pretty movie, and I'm in my twenties....but I know most other young people would not like a film like this.  If this film had been made and released now in the late 1990s, it would basically bomb at the box office.  Unfortunately, people no longer admire epic-like movies such as ""Chariots of Fire"".  It's a shame.  This movie has been described by some as a ""family movie""; I think it could be described in that way in the sense that it's a ""harmless"" movie. There's no blood/gore, or erotic sex scenes, or anything else that would be considered ""foul"".  This is just a movie that's all about triumph and being the best that you can be.  Yeah, it takes place in the early part of the century, and almost everyone in the movie speaks with a proper British accent (things that would bore most audiences), but it is an outstanding movie.  You won't forget the most famous scene in the movie (which can be seen both at the beginning and at the end of the movie): the scene that shows the men running along the seashore, while Vangelis' score plays in the background.  This movie was very deserving of any Best Movie award that was or could've been handed to it."

"Gavno","7","4","9","2 October 2004"," England's Turn of the Century, 24 years late
","CHARIOTS OF FIRE is a fascinating film on many levels; it shows us an England that no longer exists. It is, at the same time, a nostalgic glance back into the dying Victorian era, and a rude, boisterous emergence into the modern world. It shows the last gasps of the ideals that made England THE imperial power of the 18th & 19th centuries; ideals that were made obsolete by a world where there were no further empires to be won.<br/><br/>Eric Liddel and his Olympic aspirations are a nearly perfect allegory here. Liddel is the product of the last great (and disastrous) crusade of the Victorian era, World War One. The war not only very nearly exterminated an entire generation of British males in the name of extending the notion of British global moral superiority, but it set into motion the social and economic forces that had to inevitably lead to the retrenchment and ultimate withdrawal from an empire that England had won over the previous 200 years.<br/><br/>As part of the elite at the top of the British social structure, he was not directly or personally touched by the carnage, death and sacrifice imposed on the lower classes by Victorian ideals, but from his privileged position he saw, and UNDERSTOOD, the meaning of it all... the Victorian concept that an Englishman must be willing to toss aside as worthless anything that he holds dear as personal values (as tradition had demanded that he construct) in favor of the demands of King and Country, was clearly proved to him to be a false standard for judging ultimate right and wrong. Make no mistake, Liddel was definitely portrayed as a man whose roots were deeply sunk into the soil of the concept of imperial England, but he also clearly saw it's flaws and limitations in the new century. Only this understanding made it reasonable, and POSSIBLE, for him to stage his rebellion that chose his religious convictions over the pressures imposed by the demands of King and Country. <br/><br/>Liddel's was the patriotism made by and for the realities of a new century, paradoxically based on his acceptance of an ancient emotional drives that far predate the existence of the British Empire.<br/><br/>If the turn of the century had been a time for the rest of the world to embrace the concept of self determination, the dying Victorian era was struggling to maintain it's grasp on English social values, trying desperately to cling to the past. The struggle would go on for another 20 years, as was shown in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP. The old HAD to eventually make way for the new if England was to survive as a major nation on the world stage.<br/><br/>Harold Abrahamson apparently came from a very different background from Liddel... he was part of the merchant class ascendancy in England, struggling against the snobbery based discrimination of the older, traditional upper classes for social acceptance. A second strike against him was the fact of his Jewish background that inspired the polite, proper, but nonetheless odious antisemitism and racism that is part and parcel of the racial superiority complex of the English social order.<br/><br/>Just the same, Abrahamson, like Liddel, was part of the Brave New World that England was emerging into... as different as their backgrounds were, Abrahamson and Liddel were unlikely brothers in arms in the underground fight for determining England's social future.<br/><br/>Especially powerful is Abrahamson's meeting with the Masters of Trinity and Caius. The meeting is an intense but low keyed, very proper, and ""civilized"" battle in which the full ugliness of racism and antisemitism is exposed in the old England. Abrahamson shows, as Geilgud had put it earlier, that he is a member of ""a stiff necked people"", in his insistence as the ""socially accepted"" Jew being brought to task by his ""betters"", that he continue to employ a personal (and clearly superior) trainer, Sam Musabini. The full ugliness of racism is exposed when they question Musabini's ethnic background, and shown by Guilgud's sarcastic relief as the Master of Trinity that Musabini is not wholly an ""inferior"" Italian, but is alloyed with an (also inferior) Arabic heritage. The scene is only one step removed from a Nazi expressing disgust over non Aryan background... a hint at the future that would mark the final demise and decline from dominance of the Victorian mindset in less than 20 years.<br/><br/>In a way... as the social future of England is clearly expressed in the triumphs of Liddel and Abrahamson, those very same triumphs also express a joyous recognition of all that was great and noble in in the old social order. It's a culmination of an era that gives pride and dignity to the accomplishments of the departing age at the same time that it also shows the promise and possibilities of that new age which is just emerging.<br/><br/>It may be trite and trivial to say it, but CHARIOTS OF FIRE is sort of a Coming of Age story for a nation."

","While I do think Raiders of the Lost Ark is the better film, Chariots of Fire is still an brilliant movie. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded which of these two films won Best Picture, they are both as good as each other.<br/><br/>At the time, Chariots of Fire was dismissed as an empty exercise in cheap schmaltz. I personally think that is an unfair distinction. What Chariots of Fire is in my view is a powerful tale about two British athletes aiming for glory in the Olympics with a certain old-fashioned innocence. The whole film is beautifully photographed, and Vangelis's score is suitably triumphant and one of his best. The direction is clever, and the script is wonderful. The story is both powerful and intriguing, and if anything it is a character study and a compelling one it is too. The film rarely drags either, and the characters(particularly the lead characters) are well-developed and credible when they could have easily been clichéd. The acting is excellent across the board, Ian Charleson and Ben Cross are both superb in their roles, likewise with Ian Holm.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a brilliant movie.

The way the film develops, you expect the two ""rivals"" to compete against each other at the end of the film to tie the two stories together. The fact that they don't is not really a criticism (it is afterall a true story), it just feels strange if you are used to Hollywood films.

All throughout the movie, I waited and waited for something interesting to happen. But alas, it was all in vain. They run in the races, win their respective medals, and that's it. Presumably, it was mean to be enjoyed by the British in patriotic fervour. I wouldn't call it a bad film, but it isn't no masterpiece either. It did not deserve the Academy Award that year. The reason I give it a 5 is the beautiful way it's been shot, the acting, and of course, the marvellous theme song.

","As an avid runner, I was more than excited to see Chariots of Fire, I was also perplexed as to why I hadn't seen it yet. Needless to say, I had high hopes for the 1981 Best Picture winner directed by Hugh Hudson. Unfortunately, I found myself largely disappointed. The look of the film was incredible. I have said it before, and will undoubtedly say it after today; I love film. I mean, I love movies shot on film. You don't get the look, like the one achieved in Chariots of Fire with digital films. When the film can lend so much to the story, like the gritty look achieved in the opening shot to distinguish the characters; the film is almost like a character itself. But enough of my monologue of the importance of the Film Preservation Society.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire tells the story of two naturally-gifted British sprinters, Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) and Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross). The story depicts how differently the athletes use their gifts in their respective lives. Abrahams, a Lithuanian practitioner of Judaism runs to cope with how different his Judaism makes him feel. Often looked down upon, his running prowess eventually garners him national respect and admiration. Conversely, Eric, the son of missionaries sees running as a way to enjoy notoriety and eventually get back into missionary work himself. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is fine, the story was solid, the pacing was too slow, and the purpose was lost. I am starting to see why I have waited so long to see the remaining Best Picture winners. Ben Cross, although he had a sympathetic character, overacted his plight, for my liking. Meanwhile, I found Ian Charleson more aloof than his character demanded. A larger problem that some questionable acting choices was the purpose of the movie. Other than the obvious statement against racism and ethnocentricism rife throughout the film, I don't know what I am supposed to have learned or gotten out of the film. Perhaps ""racism is bad"" was the only purpose, which remains an important message, but I believe there was more attempting to be communicated. It could have been that the message was over my head, however, regardless, it didn't strike me. I concede that another viewing will almost always help in situations like these, but herein lies the movie buff problem; if I didn't like it the first time, will I ever watch it again?"

"unhinged","Null","2","4","19 February 2001"," True Story?
","When I first saw this film in a theater I was captivated by it.  It is still an excellent film, whether viewed as an inspiration piece, a period study, a character study or a sports movie.  I was so excited by it, I wanted to learn more and did a fair amount of research, including interviewing Jackson Scholz, the American runner who hands Eric Liddel some biblical encouragement just before his final race.  A few people have noted some minor discrepancies, such as the fact that Liddel and the coaches knew of the Sunday scheduling of the 100 meters finals weeks and even months ahead of time (making the dramatic interview with the British Olympic Committee a fabrication).  I've seen others note that Harold Abrahams was actually quite popular at Cambridge.  There are, however some more fundamental untruths here.<br/><br/>One of the key motivational relationships here is Abrahams' love for the woman he eventually married, singer Sybil Gordon.  He finds he must separate himself from her to train with Sam Mussabini to gain his goal.  The problem? He didn't meet her until after he had retired from running.<br/><br/>Another key relationship is Abrahams friendship with Aubrey Montague.  The film depicts them entering Cambridge together, joining clubs etc together. Harold says of Aubrey ""You are my most complete man.""  The problem? Aubrey went to rival Oxford.  He even wrote to his mother about an Oxford-Cambridge track meet which Abrahams dominated and from which he was carried victorious by him team mates, ""I hoped they'd drop him.""  (They became friends later in life while serving on amateur athletic boards as I recall.)<br/><br/>The incident with Liddel goes a bit deeper than the bit of poetic license noted above.  The incident concerning the refusal run on Sunday did occur, but with a different team (the Americans, of all people)and in a prior Olympics (the Stockholm if memory serves).  There is more to the depiction of Liddel that is disturbing.  Most of part of the film that concerns him focuses on the conflict between his desire to compete and his sister's concern that this was distracting from his missionary and religious work. Despite the film's crediting her as a consultant, she was quite hurt by the depiction of her and has always insisted she was completely supportive of his running career, as was his entire family.  (Scholz also told me that he has refused to see the film because he felt it depicted the Americans as arrogant; this seems to have been based on his script review, which contained scenes which were not in the movie I saw.)<br/><br/>(There are other factual discrepancies, such as the identification of Abrahams as the first man to win the `College Dash.'  I didn't find any of these issues to go to the heart of the movie, however.  I have written Colin Welland seeking a bibliography of his source material to try to understand why my research is at such odds with his screenplay, but without response.)<br/><br/>I understand the need to vary from the facts at times to make a point. But if you take all of these `facts'  away, what is left of the movie?  If Welland had wanted to write a movie ""based on historical characters"" or ""based on a true story"" I could understand.   But one of the first screens asserts that the movie is a ""true story,"" or words to that effect.  This was what led me to research the facts.  I wish I had never done so, as the movie is beautifully done.  It is still one of my favorites, but I cannot watch it with the enthusiasm I once had for it."
"mst3k2222","10","2","4","17 July 2000"," Soporific-Ha!
","Simply put, this is one of my favorite films of all time. I avoided seeing this movie for several years because I heard it was about two British runners training for the 1924 Olympics (how Boring!). Fortunately, I read a short review in the TV section when it was coming on television. The unknown reviewer stated that the above mentioned scenario would be boring, right? WRONG! He said that this was a must see movie, and boy was he ever right. The contrast between the English runner and the Scottish runner was tremendous due to the fact that they were running for totally separate reasons, but the commitment was the same. The Scottish runner's refusal to compromise his beliefs humbled me because I do not know if I would have had the courage to do what he did. In real life he actually had a few months notice of the race dates rather than the mere days (two weeks?) as depicted in the movie. This however does not in any way detract from the truly amazing achievement of switching from one race distance to another in a world class event. Anyone who knows anything about track and field racing can attest to that fact! The score by Vangelis was a classic! It contributed greatly to the emotion of the film. I can unabashedly say that I was greatly moved (read-shed a tear) at the end of the second big race. It was a fitting testament to the life of a great man who was cut down while a missionary to China. Great performances, great direction, great movie! I can't recommend it more."

Just imagine, you have 2 characters in the film fighting for the same destination but they never have fights, differences or any hatred about each other. This is unbeatable ! That's something out of mainstream ideology and if it appeared so early in 80s means it is ever more special. Ian Charleson and Ben Cross give honest and dedicated performances. I just wonder how come none of them won Oscars? Hugh Hudson does a remarkable thing in athletes films history as he finishes race just on time and makes it to the top of the list. The background score and cinematography is top class and deserve a special mention in this positive review. Overall, Chariots of Fire is a must see for all the athletic lovers but as a motion picture it has got everything for film lovers too. I may not see such a breathtaking pacy ride anytime soon. This is Terrific ! The chariots of fire just fire all the way and the burn needs to be experienced by all. Just 7.2/10 on IMDb... You kidding? You all should be ashamed for making it underrated.<br/><br/>RATING - 8/10*<br/><br/>By - #samthebestest"

This film was widely viewed as one of the surprise winner's of the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>The story of two very different British runners, as they prepare to compete in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) an English Jew faces both prejudice for origins and criticism for his use of a professional trainer Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) in his preparations for the Olympics. His rival and teammate Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a devout Christian whose life ambition is to become a missionary. Liddell see's his running as a way of glorifying god and memorably follows one of his races with a sermon. The film is both a powerful and stirring story of perseverance and also a story of conscience.<br/><br/>The cast included such notables as Nigel Havers, John Gielgud, Alice Krige, Brad Davis and director Lindsay Anderson<br/><br/>The standout scenes for me would both be running scenes. Firstly we have The Great Court Run at Trinity College, Cambridge. Secondly of course we have the iconic opening beach running scene at St Andrews, Scotland. Strangely, for the film the Great Court Run had to be recreated at Eton College because the film makers were refused permission to film at Trinity College.<br/><br/>The film features a stirring soundtrack by Vangelis (Vangelis Papathanassiou), which may sound a little dated (to some perhaps) with its use of synthesizers, but regardless it remains incredibly effective. The sequence used for the aforementioned slow motion running opening scene on the beach has much used in any number of slow motion parodies."

This movie is a perfect example for the aforementioned category.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the United Kingdom athletes running on the shore and the background music gives you goose bumps. Harold is a Jew and a victim of bigotry. He is an athlete gifted with strong legs that makes him a good sprinter. He shatters the 700-year record of the University and makes himself conspicuous to the selectors. Eric is a devout Christian from Scotland and is the finest sprinters of the region. Harold and other athletes are spellbound when Eric topples during a race, falls behind other men in the race, gets up on his feet, and wins the race by a whisker. They race against each other and Eric emerges as the fastest man. A shocked Harold gets guidance and training from Sam and the men then head to Paris to compete in the 1924 Olympics. Eric withdraws from the 100m sprint saying it would be injustice if Harold and Eric- men from the same country- competed against each other on the eve of the race. Harold goes on to win the sprint ahead of the world's fastest men- Americans. The next day, Eric wins his 400m race and receives thunderous applause from all corners of the world for his sacrifice and glory.<br/><br/>A powerful movie with powerful phrases and music."
"Steffi_P","9","0","0","28 October 2011"," ""The pursuit of excellence""
","The 1980s were a time now looked back on by many as rather embarrassing and misguided, usually in terms of fashion and music, but no less so in the motion picture industry. This was, after all, that brief era when it was acceptable for a period film to be scored with synths. Enthusiastically modernist as it undoubtedly is, I still love 80s cinema for its naïve charm, and the fact that beneath that cheesy veneer still lurked movies of sincerity and sophistication. Chariots of Fire is exemplary in this case.<br/><br/>It would be hard for anyone to guess the movie had the makings of a classic though. Sports movies are generally dull (unless they're about boxing), and a bunch of British runners in the 1920s hardly sounds inspiring. And yet the Colin Welland screenplay is a thing of real intelligence and poignancy. It is not, like many sports pictures, basically a drama with the sport as a backdrop – it really is all about the running. And yet other issues and preoccupations of the characters are shot through it – Liddell's devoutness, Abrahams's struggle against prejudice and his seemingly at-odds love of performing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Lindsay's sacrifice to allow Liddell to run. A few liberties are taken with historical accuracy, but these are only for the sake of fine-tuning the dramatic power, without slipping into complete misrepresentation. What we get is an intimate story of credible figures displaying admirable dedication and camaraderie.<br/><br/>The two lead players here – Ben Cross and Ian Charleson – were unknowns at the time and they have remained fairly obscure. And while neither of them is exactly outstanding (the roles don't really call for such a thing) they are fully adequate. Cross is genuinely able to sing and play the piano, but also convinces as an athlete. Charleson comes across as a supremely sedate and thoughtful man, and has a kind of charisma that makes him captivating despite his calmness. The biggest treats however are amongst the supporting players, a bevy of Britain's finest character actors. Ian Holm is especially impressive. Often chomping a cigar, his face half-hidden by a straw hat, the personality of Mussabini all comes through in those little gestures and mad energy. There are also memorable bit parts from a sniffy Richard Griffiths and a humourless John Gielgud.<br/><br/>Like his stars, director Hugh Hudson is by no means amazing, but he gets the job done. His slow-moving, constantly-roving camera helps to give the picture a nice flowing pace. His camera placement often seems almost arbitrary, with tops of heads cropped and so forth, but he seems to be giving an ""in-the-thick-of-it"" look, without resorting to the clunkiness of hand-held camera. At some of the most emotional moments, such as Holm's personal celebration of his protégé's win, he keeps well back from the action. This gives a kind of respectful distance and allows the power of the moment to come across in body language rather than facial expression.<br/><br/>But I feel the picture's greatest strength lies in the way it is all put together. There is this continual, breathtaking interweaving of ideas through music, for example, the singing of a church choir plays over one of Charleson's races, or ""He is an Englishman"" playing as Cross trains after his confrontation with the anti-Semitic deans. Slow-motion, usually a rather trite and obvious technique, is used here to such smooth and subtle effect, with some clever mixes of slow image and normal speed sound, or cutting from slo-mo runners to normal speed crowds. It all helps to pull what is essentially a rather disparate plot (Cross and Charleson barely have any scenes together), and bring out the tones and themes in a way that is purely cinematic. This is even where that seemingly inappropriate Vangelis score comes in – it has a kind of transcendent quality that makes its anachronism irrelevant. On the surface, this may look like a lot of 80s ""hi-tec""ness guilding the dramatic lily, but it is all just another form of expression in this beautiful medium."

","The true story of two athletes in the 1924 Olympic Games is given a gossamer screen treatment and becomes a visually elegant inspiration piece, English to the core, glorifying God and Empire with pomp and circumstance, and no shortage of heartfelt virtue. The subjects are Eric Liddell, a Scottish missionary who ran to experience divine ecstasy, and Harold Abrahams, an English Jew for whom running offered an answer to bigotry. Dramatic momentum demands the two compete, but history is not so obliging, leaving an empty spot at the heart of the film. The big Olympic finale is, as a result, almost anticlimactic, with a token conflict built around the not exactly earth shattering dilemma of Liddell's refusal to race on the Sabbath. Every character is built atop a foundation of noble thought and decent English manners, providing the true source of the film's inspiration – not the competitions or the training scenes, or the absurdly popular theme music by synthesizer wizard Vangelis Papathanasiou, which lacks a certain period flavor, to say the least."

But you have to be able to see the big picture and understand that in the year this movie was made (1981), the genre was not a common place in Hollywood history yet. This picture set the mark for all of those who would come in the later years, and in fact the industry tried very hard to explore it as much as it could. <br/><br/>The story is set in the time gap that preceded the 1924 olympic games, and focus on two running athletes from the British team that competed in the games. It is a period movie, with good production and costumes design that really sets you in the first quarter of the last century.

That's really all there is to say.

To conform to a gentler society and have respect for other humans is an admirable quality - we are so selfishly indulging ourselves today (2007), we hardly notice how uncaring we are.<br/><br/>As many have written, director Hugh Hudson and screen-writer Colin Welland have produced a film which will be inspiring for an eternity. What a shock that schlock (""Reds"") and cartoon-like action (""Raiders"") rightfully lost-out to a gentle story of personal pride in one's own actions and beliefs.....""stay the course"" certainly had a different meaning in that age. I know from personal experience - I gave-up my life's dream because I did not have the determination to struggle through the difficult times to reach the ultimate happiness of success. However, I've grown from that mistaken decision: it forced me to see myself as perhaps others would, if they knew the story.<br/><br/>The fact that Eric Lidell returned to China to take-up his interrupted mission, and died because of his courage and desire to serve his God, is edifying enough.

Rounded out by an all star cast with Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, Nigel Havers, Nigel Davenport, Alice Krige and Patrick Magee it is a story of two very diverse men who are bound toward the same goal, the 1924 Paris Olympics, but who refuse to compromise their personal honor to the demands of others. The funeral scene, which opens and closes the film was especially poignant and never fails to move me to tears. It is ironic that Eric Liddle was killed in China for his faith while still a young man, and actor Ian Charleson succumbed in his youth to AIDS. This is just one of those films whom everyone needs to see, along with ""Amadeus"" and ""Gandhi"" making the early eighties one of the greatest periods for biographical Best Picture Winners.

","This film addresses the trajectory and rivalry between two Olympic runners of the English racing team who participated in the 1924 Olympics, in Paris. However, its far from be a mere sports film and can be seen under different prisms and approaches. Harold Abrahams is a young Jewish athlete who is determined to win all the races he runs in order to prove his worth to everyone, and perhaps to himself in the first place. The subjects of anti-Semitism and social elitism are evident and greatly affect his character and personality. His rival, Eric Liddell, is a Protestant, son of missionaries and husband of a devotee of the Presbyterian Church. He sees race as a way to praise and magnify God, and is so strict with his faith that he refuses to participate in races on Sunday. One wishes to affirm himself, to show what he is capable of, while the other knows what he is capable of, wanting only to thank those who believe that he has given him these abilities. Both, however, are marked by society because they do not fit fully into it, one for ethnic reasons, the other for the religious fervor in which he lives. Hypocrisy also appears in this film: university rectors who rejoice over a student's achievements but are not able to show it openly, or the banned trainer who is forced to watch his pupil's run from a window. And we also have something that still happens in today's Olympics: exacerbated nationalism's turning healthy sporting into a matter of national pride, fueled by medals and ovations.<br/><br/>From these considerations you may be thinking that the plot is the best thing this movie has to offer and that's true, but it's not bad if you think the essence of any movie is to tell a good story. But it's also true that it's not the only good thing in this movie. The cast has heavy names that worked furiously and played great. Ben Cross was great like Abrahams, being able to express very well the psychological and emotional fragility's of this character; Ian Charleson was equally good in the role of Liddell, especially when speaking or talking about religion. On the track the issue was different, for I hated to see the actor running so affected and artificial, with his mouth wide open and swallowing all the unsuspecting flies that came up on the way. Cinematography is very good, within the standards of the films of the late seventies and early eighties, without the quality that the current film and digital resources have already accustomed our eyes. Some camera shots are excellent and quite unique. As for the soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, it really has become an icon, although I do not like the sound of the synthesizer and prefer the same song in a totally orchestral version. But this is a matter of personal taste.<br/><br/>Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this film only achieved four of them, among which ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Soundtrack"". I also have some doubts about whether it will age well and stay popular in the coming decades, since it has virtually disappeared from DVD store windows, as well as from TV channels (even those who are especially dedicated to movie broadcasting). In any case, it remains one of the best films of the eighties and is an absolute must for any connoisseur of the seventh art."

"sashank_kini-1","8","1","2","11 February 2012"," A Moving Film, Albeit Verbose Occasionally
","A number of sports movies turn up with predictable results; only a few of them surprise you. Generally, it's always the rise of the underdogs who live their sport, and manage to come up miraculously and win in the end. It ends with a cloying victory celebration in slow-mo. The surprising ones may not take this conventional approach, though it moves on similar lines. Chariots of Fire takes this unconventional approach of not turning the film into a German vs. Jew film where one is bad and the other is good. It does not take sides, but regards its characters as actual human beings with personal desires and goals and t prejudices. <br/><br/>Some may be disappointed with the 'Everyone's happy!' climax as there is always an adrenaline that even gushes among viewers when they watch a spots film; they want to cheer one side and jeer the other. In Chariots of Fire, the director takes a leisurely approach that insists viewers not to take sides but to enjoy the game. We do end up rooting for both the German and the Jew rather than placing our bets on one. This helps to avoid having a theme of 'acceptance between races', as while watching the film, one realizes that the 'racial discrimination' is more in the mind of the Jew rather than the others; the Jew's girlfriend laughs with disbelief at his perception regarding the Germans' bias towards Jews. By not taking sides, it has toned down the controversial matter. And it is generally advisable not to let such matters overshadow the main element of the film, that is 'race', which itself serves as a pun.<br/><br/>It is surprising that as I write the review, my perception regarding the film, which I only saw yesterday, widens. I am able to see the analogy between 'race' as a sport, and 'race' as in human race. The ending in the film is all the more satisfying to me now. The film is about the Olympics Event in 1924 which saw the victories of Harold Abraham, a Jewish runner and Eric Liddell, a devout Catholic runner. Both have their stories to tell – Harold is the son of a wealthy Jewish financier, who never tasted defeat in racing till he met his match in Liddell, a catholic who serves the Church and is constantly solicited by his sister to devote less time to races and more towards missionaries. Liddell, in a memorable line from the film, says 'God made me fast'. Both have reasons to race, but the satisfaction they get from winning is different. It can be seen not only from their running style but also on their faces when they cross the finish line. Abraham reveres Liddell, who runs like the wind and looks blissful when he wins. That creates a silent rivalry between them as both men want to prove. <br/><br/>The film manages to be inspiring, although it is not a perfect movie. Because it is British, the temperament among the racers itself is quite phlegmatic; it is like watching sheep running in a field. Indian films like Lagaan and Chak De India are louder and more ebullient while American films very exciting and fast-paced. It may bore many viewers who expected the sound of the gunshot and banging of loud drums and fast-paced racing. But is it not fascinating to observe the expressions on all those racers' faces when the film is in slow-mo? How funny is it to watch Lindsay's tongue sticking out like a dog when he runs? Or Liddell's almost orgasm-like reaction to winning? Or even Abraham's intense face determination? <br/><br/>The only complaints I had with the film was that at times, the monologues were too long. Also, Nicholas Farrell's Aubrey did not have much character development, in spite of being introduced in the beginning of the movie itself. Sybil Gordon's character was a distraction here; instead, more screen time could have been given to Aubrey, Abraham and Liddell. Plus Cheryl Campbell acted more like Liddell's fiancée than sister. The acting overall could have been a few notches higher, and there were moments when I found the character development, especially of Liddell to be weak. And I felt that a little more singing from Abraham was needed; he has a good singing voice. Chariots of Fire may not be immediately arousing but it will move you once you begin realizing the universality of the theme. <br/><br/>My Rating: 7.6 out of 10"

","Chariots of Fire is a sports drama, British style. This is the film that is the template for all sports afterwards. Chariots of Fire is set from 1919 to the 1924 Paris Olypmics. It forces on two athletics, Harold Abrahams, a student at Cambridge university and from a Jewish background, and Eric Liddell, a committed Scottish Christian. Both become rivals and the film shows them trying to improve themselves, working hard to get into the British Olympics team. Abarahams has to battle against Cambridge's elitist system and even against anti-Semitism, such as stereotypes like Jews were money lenders and thinking he would favour his religion over his country. Liddell personal battle is between his wish for sporting success which conflicted with his religious beliefs. This even led to Liddell having to sacrifice running in his favoured race because the event because it was on the sabbath.<br/><br/>Unlike most in most sports films, even good ones like Cinderella Man, the rivals do not have a hatred for each other nor make out one be sympathetic hero and the other an unlikely villain. Both Abrahams and Liddell were just made out to be men who wanted to do well and even had respect for each other. That was an aspect I liked in this film. Also by having two major characters you got to see the different challenges the athletes had to face and help with the drama.<br/><br/>The direction by Hugh Hudson was good, especially the sports scene. Those scenes have become iconic and so has the musical score. The acting was also top quality and the script is decent. However I personally thought at times the film was a like cold and hollow and also a little slow.<br/><br/>This is a film more about sport. They are obvious themes about the old boy system and Cambridge, religion, personal sacrifice, friendship and self-improvement."
"eastbergholt2002","9","1","2","14 December 2006"," Classic sports movie set in the 1920s
","I recently watched Chariots of Fire again and it's still enjoyable. I first saw it back in 1981, when it was something of a phenomenon and a refreshing change. It was an old fashioned feel-good movie that looked good, told an uplifting story and had a brilliant score by Vangelis.<br/><br/>It's essentially about two British athletes and their quest for gold at the 1924 Paris Olympics. It tries to explain what drove them and like all good sports movies you become a fan and part of their inevitable success. The film is based on real events but Colin Welland's script doesn't let the facts stand in the way of a good story. In his defence, the liberties taken probably help the story and add to the drama.<br/><br/>Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) is an ambitious sprinter at Cambridge University who is desperate win. Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) is a Scottish rugby international and a devoted Christian who becomes a missionary in China after the games. Liddell believes that God made him fast for a purpose so he gives up rugby and focuses on sprinting. His sister Jennie (Cheryl Campbell) believes that his running is a silly waste of time. <br/><br/>Both runners compete against each other in 1923 and Liddell comes out on top. Over the winter Abrahams hires a professional coach Sam Mussabini (Ian Holm) to help him prepare for the games. Meanwhile Harold meets and falls in love with Sybil Gordon (Alice Krige) a light opera singer. On the eve of the games Liddell discovers that the heats of the 100 meters are being held on Sunday and switches to the 400 meters. <br/><br/>All the actors give excellent performances, but Ben Cross and Krige are exceptionally good. Welland's script contains a long list of historical inaccuracies. Liddell knew months before the games that his heats would be on a Sunday. In the film, Abrahams, who was a Jew, claims that he is being discriminated against. Many people dispute this. The story claims that Mussabini was desperate to coach an Olympic champion for the first time. However, he also trained Reggie Walker (winner of the 100 meters in 1908) and Albert Hill (winner of the 800 and 1,500 meters in 1920). Welland creates new characters like Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers)and omits Douglas Lowe who attended Cambridge with Abrahams and won the 800 meters in Paris. I could go on. <br/><br/>The film came at the right time when the world was ready for noble heroes. The film still retains some magic and is well worth watching."

","Like the sports it is about, this movie is a lean and straightforward study of what it takes to become the best, from two quite different perspectives. There are no gimmicks, little drama, no bad guys, just understated visions of struggle and triumph.<br/><br/>As many have said, Vangelis' one-of-a-kind score elevates the movie from merely good to great, but I feel that separating them might be foolish: as the best scores do, it becomes one with the movie and the end result is an extraordinary whole, not a ""good movie with a great score"".<br/><br/>I can see why many people don't like it. It doesn't have many conventional elements of a movie and is about mood as much as plot. But, for those whom it suits, there is much inspiration to be found in this simple tale."

","I remember when I first saw this movie in a theatre(1981) that upon the start of closing credits there was an absolute hush and then the audience of movie goers applauded.  It has happened to me only a couple of times over the years and it leaves quite an impression. I love this movie for so many reasons.   It is a perfectly preserved snapshot of a moment in time.  The cinematography and set design as well as costumes are absolutely stunning.  The personal struggles of two very different men who come together on one very important day is both moving and engrossing.  I do not have to be religious or athletic to enjoy this film and am not.  It's theme of the pursuit of an elusive personal goal for very personal and to those around them,sometimes obtuse reasons is what made this movie for me.  Eric Charleson is fantastic as Eric Liddell - integrity and charm - a wonderful combination.  Ben Cross as Harold Abrahams is excellent, though difficult to like as the driven and emotionally prickly jewish runner with a bone to pick. As I said, this is a wonderful snap of a moment in time.  Like a fly in amber, this age, with it's naivete and emphasis on integrity,is preserved wonderfully by Hugh Hudson.  Highly recommended."

","It does not get any better than the Olypmics, especially the athletics part of it, which is what this movie focuses on. I've always wanted to win a gold medal at the Olympics and that is the dream of many others I'm sure. This movie is truly an inspiration, taking it at any point of view. You can look at the negative in this film but it's sure to bring success and inspiration to the viewer. It's a timeless classic and it shows us that winning is not everything and that some people are highly dedicated to other things besides paying off all of the years of blood, sweat and hard work with an Olympic gold medal win. Winning is not everything and that's what this movie is about. It's about inspiration beyond winning, beyond getting what you deserve. This movie is about doing what others ask of you. Now, I ask of you, have you seen this movie? If so, you have a feel at what I'm talking about, if not, you need to get out and see it for yourself. People need to realize there are more substantial lessons to be learned and things to be done besides winning, even if winning means the most prestigious competitive prize in this world. You may never win but you will always learn and learning is as infinite as you want it to be."

","It's interesting how composers not only borrow from themselves, but from each other.  In some cases, like 'Ed Wood', the intention theft works because we automatically associate the tunes to the time period.  In 'Fire and Ice', the notes are blatantly ripped from 'Jaws.'<br/><br/>Here we have something accomplished and daring thanks to two geniuses.<br/><br/>Watkin brought the visual energy, namely to the races.  Thanks to him, our perspective of athletes has changed from Riefenstahl's propaganda (now appropriated by every TV network) to 'Rocky' (another formula: character-driven).  Here the athletes are not competitors, but instead are angels.  He did similar exuberant work on 'Africa' and 'Catch-22'.<br/><br/>The other genius, of course, is Vangelis.  I bet it's because of this that Scott collaborated with him twice.  Despite the mix of old/new concepts with the score, it works.  The equivalent today would be having Aerosmith rescore 'Braveheart'.<br/><br/>Faltermeyer understood the music's aspirations and copied it for 'Top Gun'.<br/><br/>Everything else is color-by-numbers, thankfully the editor understood what Watkin was doing in 'Memphis Belle'.  Even Ian Holm disappoints.  Can you imagine?  One of our ""grand old men"" of science fiction not really acting? It's because of the film's triumphant theme that anything else looks good. Had Alex North handled it, we would've forgotten it.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I only recommend this on the value of its music.

","CHARIOTS OF FIRE has everything its got to be a true film classic...except for ""The Award-Winning Mistake"". A truly dramatic chronicle of the running sport, it has unbelievable craftsmanship in its masterful screenplay about competing athletes, and shows us how the mind and soul can possess a willful spirit of hoping for the best, making a winning statement for itself. Holding up exceptionally well in the test of time is the visuals that recreate 1924, much like rivaling TITANIC eighteen years later. Vangelis' electronic music score has been sensational, including the breathtaking theme music that still gets played on some easy listening stations. Put these pieces together and you have a fine work of cinematic art for all the future generations to see. And now, I present to you ""The Award-Winning Mistake""! A black boom mic shows in front of two kissy-pies who are about to say goodbye, and we have news reporters who carry paper and pencils, but no high-tech microphones (see, they didn't even exist in the 20s!). There should have been further examinations of this scene by the A.M.P.A.S. judges before giving this a 1981 Best Picture Oscar. Without any other doubts, this is a disgusting piece of matter that makes a fine film look bad! Minus one point, there!

"mc-dsmith-2","10","1","3","29 June 2000"," Incredible movie!
","I agree with the first poster that the film might seem soporific. It took me several tries to get through it. It is very subtle, and the English and Scottish accents have a tendency to obscure the dialogue for Americans, I think. On the other hand, I have never seen such an amazing commentary on the motivations of Great Men. The film is really a contrast between two types: the internally and the externally motivated man.  On the one hand is Harold Abrahams, a man who has never been beaten in a race, coming up against his own limitations. He is the externally motivated man--he runs to fight the racism he finds in England because he is Jewish--he feels compelled, driven to race to prove that he is better than the non-Jews around him. ON the other hand, there is Eric Liddell, his polar opposite. A man who feels compelled to run because of his Scottish Presbyterian religion: "" When I run, I feel God's pleasure."" He has hurdles to overcome, himself, in the form of his family who feels that his life is better devoted to missionary work.<br/><br/>The real crux of the matter is which one is the greater man--a question that is not resolved when they race against each other. This movie is rich in subtlety and understanding of human character. And the music is, obviously, amazing. But you will leave still wondering: which is better, to be motivated by competitive spirit, or to be motivated by a sort of Wordsworthian joie de vivre, in which excelling at something is its own reward.<br/><br/>I think the answer to this may be found in another quote (or misquote), ""and Alexander wept, for he had no more worlds to conquer."" The externally motivated man is a bit of a neurotic, as Abrahams trainer remarks in the movie. But his world-beating is done when he achieves certain goals to prove his point against those who surround him--this type of man tends to accomplish everything while he is young.  He is driven even beyond his limits by competition with others. The internally motivated man is less neurotic and less compulsive, appearing more god-like, as the movie shows. Yet he is not driven in the same way to surpass his own limits, relying more on his natural born gifts. True world-beaters are single-minded like Abrahams. Internally motivated men tend to be more rounded, more of a renaissance man like Eric Liddell, who does not hold winning above all else.<br/><br/>The question the movie leaves us with is who is greater.<br/><br/>Abrahams went on to become a great statesman of British athletics. Liddell was killed in missionary work to China while he was still young."
"spottedreptile","8","1","3","5 May 2000"," Beautifully crafted and still relevant today
","It's hard to remember that in 1981 things like slow motion replays were not used by everybody, nor was the use of synthesised music in period pieces (or classical music in scifi epics either).<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire was quite a groundbreaker at the time. Technically the film is quite brilliant. The editing just raises the film to another level, especially Eric Liddell's speech at Church which is intercut with the races, and the use of slow motion replays, which do become a bit overdone unfortunately. The themes are universal and still relevant today, especially when we enter the next millenium with the 2000 Olympics, and compare what they have become with what they were back in 1924, before tv, before radio, before professionalism in sport.<br/><br/>It's a look at racism and the burning desire to win for one's race, at ideas of national pressures brought to bear on individuals and what we 'ought' to be prepared to do for our country, at how people are differently motivated to sacrifice a normal life in pursuit of glory, the advent of sport as a business, and how winning changes everything. <br/><br/>The script allows us to view some of today's sporting conundrums by looking at sport in the past. It also allows for fine characterisations, such as those of Abrahams (Ben Cross), his coach Mussabini (Ian Holm) and the deliciously overdrawn British Olympics Committee led by the Prince of Wales (David Yelland). The screenplay has a fun time with the irony of Wales' speech to Liddell about 'duty' and 'honour', fourteen years before he abdicates to marry Wallis Simpson. <br/><br/>I found it to be a rich and beautifully crafted film that is still satisfying after many viewings, and still has implications for modern sport. The film is solidly English and stereotypes American athletes, but is not above taking a dig at Oxbridge elitism and the hypocrisy of those who just want to win, but don't want to be seen to want to win.<br/><br/>
I would not say that the film advocates professionalism over the amateur code. I feel it shows sport as on the threshold of a great and probably inevitable change, for better or worse, and sporting bodies must either adapt if they want to win, or gracefully bow out. <br/><br/>I give this film 8 out of 10. It's not historically accurate, but then it is a film, not a documentary. Even documentaries play around with the 'truth' in search of angles. <br/><br/>Vangelis' score is magnificent, the performances all round are solid, and the story is fascinating."
"FredWWW","10","1","3","27 June 1999"," Finding one's Spirit within
","Chariots is a wonderful movie that moves the viewer emotionally on multiple levels.  Superficially, the viewer is grabbed by the inter/intra-instituitional and Olympic racing contests which pique the viewer's competative spirit with the wonderment of who will win.  But, like others who have commented, I most enjoy the spiritual uplifting level that tells the truth of our need to become more than we are in ourselves - to find that spirit within that helps us achieve what we cannot on our own.<br/><br/>Once in a while a movie captures this essence of God's great gift to us, the Spirit within.  While striving to live our lives on our own terms, to those who will listen, God finds a way to pull our attention to the greater glory of service to Him by serving others.  Protagonists Liddell and Abrahams each demonstrate this truth, albeit differently.<br/><br/>Liddell has grown up knowing this and, in seeking to race, is only conflicted by Jenny's concern that his racing will pull them away from the greater missionary journey they both know lies in front of them.  I feel Eric's answer to her for this purpose hits precisely God's relationship to us.  He wishes to lift us up so that we may lift others up to the knowledge of Him.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most beautiful and poignant scene comes on Sunday in Paris as<br/><br/>the Olympics continue while Eric Liddell speaks his heart from the a pulpit. Quite a telling scene about one's priorities."
"KnightsofNi11","5","2","10","24 June 2012"," Boring as hell and too pompous for my taste
","The Academy Awards has made some pretty big goofs over the years. Giving the best picture Oscar to Chariots of Fire rather than Raiders of the Lost Ark was one such goof. A quintessential action/adventure film that is now considered one of the best of all time was beaten out by a boring, pretentious, and pompous sports drama. A damn shame if you ask me. But what's done is done of course, and I can at least say I sat down and watched Chariots of Fire to analyze if it truly was deserving of an awards, and I can say it wasn't. Chariots of Fire is about two track runners, one a hotshot Jew and the other a devout Christian, who compete in the 1924 Paris Olympics for Great Britain. It's their story of perseverance and the way they would stop at nothing achieve their goals, except go against their own honor.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is a film whose highly recognizable theme song which we all have heard far exceeds its reputation. The song is much more well known than the film it came from, and that's probably because Chariots of Fire is not a memorable film aside from that empowering soundtrack. It's slow, uneventful, and just plain boring. There's little to no conflict throughout the movie, and what little conflicts arise get resolved so quickly, sometimes in the exact same scene as when they were introduced. We know from the start how the film is going to play out, and there are no surprises along the way. It's a drag to watch and you will be so happy when it's finally over.<br/><br/>The only thing I can bring myself to give Chariots of Fire credit for is its passion. It tries so hard to be a fantastic and moving film, but it tries a little too hard. It wants to be a classic so badly and it tells its story with as much passion and as much determination as one can tell a story so uninteresting. Also, there are some pretty decent performances throughout the film, namely from Ian Holm who does an excellent job at portraying the coach of one of the runners. But the characters in the film are bland and there isn't much going on with them. They seem to want to have a lot of depth, but they really go nowhere. But I can commend the actors portraying these flat characters, as well as the rest of the filmmakers, for trying to make Chariots of Fire a great film, but it was sadly a failure."
"de_niro_2001","6","1","4","10 July 2007"," A film claimed by both English and Scots
","Eric Liddell is a Scottish national hero but prior to this film being made few Scots born in the second half of the 20th century had heard of him. The Scottish locations, some of which are meant to be England, such as the famous opening scene where St Andrews stands in for Broadstairs in Kent and the London restaurant which is actually the Cafe Royal in Edinburgh, add to its appeal to Scots. But some say it is a very English film, with its Oxbridge educated gentleman athletes taking on the world. It is a good film although a bit overrated. It has also said it was a film for Thatcher's Britain, whatever that may mean. It certainly is very much a film of its time. It came out at the time when just about every new TV drama series on the BBC and ITV was set in the 1920s and 30s and it features two stalwarts of these series in its cast, namely Cheryl Campbell and Nigel Havers. There are, however, some rather unpardonable anachronisms in it. 1980s cars can be seen in quite a few shots and the ship that takes the athletes over to France has a radar mast. If the film were made nowadays the ship would be a CGI effect and the whole film would look a lot more realistic with the help of some CGI. But on the whole it is good although not quite all that it is cracked up to be. When it was made there were not as many films being made for the cinema, in fact it looked possible that the big screen would die out altogether, and this was one reason why it stood out. Another reason it stood out was that it depicted two decent upright guys. Mind you, I don't agree with Liddell's sabbatarianism, and the film's writer, Colin Welland, said he didn't either. But Liddell is portrayed as a surprisingly kind and warm man for a sabbatarian although after telling the boy off for playing football on Sunday I think he would have great difficulty in convincing the boy that God wasn't a spoilsport. It was sad that Ian Charleson died young like two other members of the cast, Brad Davis and Jeremy Sinden. A good film but very much of its time."

","A pair of conflicted athletes are central to this story of runners preparing for the 1924 Olympic Games. By coincidence, their particular faiths are central to their conflicts as well. When Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) reaches the pinnacle of his running career, he's forced into a decision not to run on the Sabbath Day, placing him at odds with his Cambridge professors who seek glory for their institution. In the case of Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), he's made a decision to set aside his missionary calling in order to give glory to God in another way, by winning an Olympic gold medal. The story involves how both men managed to turn their circumstances into favorable solutions so that they could compete in their respective contests. At times the picture gives the impression that the runners were destined to race against each other, but that wasn't the case. That would have been noteworthy as one of them would have had to face being second best, which was anathema to them both.<br/><br/>""Chariots of Fire"" was a Best Picture winner in it's day against a widely diverse array of films. One could argue it's strength against competition like ""Reds"", ""On Golden Pond"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Atlantic City"", but it's probably safe to say that the movie would have found it hard to muster the same level of support during the present time. With both Christianity and Judaism under fire in the popular culture, the story's emphasis on religious faith would likely make it a weak contender, if even considered a candidate for the top award. It's also presented as a meaningful character study as opposed to dynamic action or adventure, which seems to turn off modern day viewers who crave over the top thrills. When this film opens it's set in London in 1978, with elderly benefactors of an English college honoring the past glory of the school and it's graduates. When it was over, the impression one's left with is that in a way, the movie speaks to the past glory of movies the way they used to be before the present day craving for gigantic explosions and computer generated special effects."

","I don't know if this is because of the actors trying to recreate the actual runner's gates or if it is the use of slow motion or what, but all the race scenes are absolutely hysterical looking.

This may be more a personal reaction but boy when the sport section of your sport film doesn't work you film is in trouble.<br/><br/>The rest of the film, the tasteful drama about how religion and society interact with sports, is generally OK. It is all far too slow, and far too proper to fully engage. It is rather perplexing that this won Best Picture at the Oscars as it is really a British God and Country film.

"robert-temple-1","Null","0","2","29 August 2012"," The spirit of 2012 captured on film 31 years earlier
","Having enjoyed watching much of the 2012 Olympics on television (in the UK, where it was all available live on multiple simultaneous channels, not the limited slices of it shown in the USA which concentrated only on the American medal winners), it seemed a good time to watch CHARIOTS OF FIRE again after many years since last seeing it. My wife and I also have a special affection for this film because it was our dear friend Jake Eberts's first film as Executive Producer. He is not credited on screen because he wanted the Executive Producer credit to go to Dodi Fayed, who put up much of the budget. (He is the same Dodi Fayed who died in the car crash with Princess Diana.) Jake started as a banker and got involved in film finance, leading him to be Executive Producer of 38 important films, only one of those I saw being one which I disliked, namely JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH (1996), which I absolutely hated. Jake's career has been marked by a high moral tone, and a strong streak of idealism. We 'remember him when', i.e. when he was 'just a young banker'. We feel very proud of him. When this film opened, it was unexpected and it burst upon the British public with a wave of enthusiasm and national pride strongly reminiscent of the Olympics which have just ended. The film was brilliantly directed by Hugh Hudson. The modern DVD has unfortunately got extremely faded colour, with browns, reds, and greens predominating. The original print at the time was much more glorious. The DVD also has a big problem with wonky sound balancing, so that music blares and voices fade up and down. You have to watch the DVD with your hand always on the remote, to adjust the sound levels so that you aren't deafened one minute and perplexed by inaudibility the next. The music was composed by Vangelis, and made him famous. That theme was played to exhaustion throughout the recent Olympics, as a recurrent motif. I once knew a beautiful harpist who was taken out by Vangelis in the 1980s, and I asked her how did it go and what was he like. She said he was a strange fellow, that his idea of a date was to drive her round and round London in his elegant Rolls Royce listening to tapes of his music, which she was expected to admire with fervour. This film is an inspiring story of a group of young British runners who want to compete at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris. In the end, two of them win gold medals, and one wins a silver. But the human dramas of the characters are intense and passionate. The film has that high moral tone which Jake himself has always had, and is a paean to personal achievement and the pursuit of excellence. (This was the basis of ancient Greek civilization, which was based upon 'excellence', which they called aretē. All that is best in Western civilisation comes from this source, though as I am always saying, the traitors within have severed the taproot of our culture to escape their own sense of mediocrity by never having to view anything superior to their own little selves.) Considering the current collapse of the British educational system, which has rotted from within because of the demented educational establishment's hatred of excellence and determination that 'nobody must lose or fail because it will make them feel bad', it is ironical that this film which glorifies the opposite, as the recent Olympics Games also did, carries such resonance for a betrayed public today. The film has not dated at all, except for its faded colour. It is as exciting and vital as it ever was, and indeed it is even more relevant than before, since it reminds us of what we have lost since 1981. If only this film could be shown in every school in Britain, but then, when will pigs fly? All the performances, except perhaps that by Lindsay Anderson as Master of Caius College, Cambridge, in the film are excellent, and the one that shines the most with idealism and vitality is that of Ian Charleson as the Scot, Eric Liddell. It is a great tragedy that such a talented actor died at the young age of 40, in 1990. He is the one everyone always remembers from this film. Possibly the next best job of acting was by Ian Holm as the coach Sam Mussabini. My favourite scene from this film has always been where the young Lord Andrew Lindsay, played by Nigel Havers, is practising his hurdling on the lawn in front of his gigantic country mansion. He has had a row of hurdles set up, and a butler sets a glass full of bubbling champagne on each hurdle. Lindsay then jumps them all without spilling a glass, except that one slightly wobbles. Such a stylish touch! This is a story which exalts heroic struggle for excellence so greatly that any parent should show it to every child on the planet. What a tonic in a declining and decadent world! None of these fine fellows would have dreamt of manipulating the LIBOR rate. What has happened to everybody? Why is everybody now so selfish, greedy, and heedless, when only the other day nobility of character was still admired, and there were still young men like these who strove for it? The film is not only about men and boys, there are women too, and I think Cheryl Campbell deserves a special mention for her convincing performance as a tedious, narrow-minded, but deeply loving sister of Eric Liddell, the Scot who forfeited a medal because he wouldn't run on Sunday. Those were the days when the cinemas were still shut all over Scotland every Sunday because it was the holy day. But today nothing is holy."

","I had heard a lot about this film but never really got a chance to see it. I already knew it was full of feelings of patriotism. But I felt kind of disappointed after it. The story was good OK. But there was nothing much to understand in the characters .They seemed to be placing the cuts around without having much thoughts. Whenever I got the feeling of understanding a situation and the characters I was just pushed from a cliff (As I felt). There was nothing like a feeling of passion that was created in any sense.

"Joel25","Null","0","1","3 January 2007"," Orders of Allegiance
","Perhaps it was the shambles of the 1980 Moscow Olympics that justified a dramatic examination of the personal and political machinery that drives Olympic athletes and draws an audiencethe motives, the principles, the ideals, nationalist, religious, or otherwise. If this is true, we have the reason why this film would flop today. It struggles to breathe outside of its historical context.<br/><br/>Elements of this can still be appreciated. One, the manner in which it compares the different machinery (order of allegiances) driving Abrahams and Liddell, revealing the full consequences of each character's drive without hammering the point into our skulls or overtly moralising. Both cross the finish line first, but only one wins. Two, the ambitious and much-talked-about Vadelis score that has aged without grace. It has been described elsewhere as striking a balance between classicism and futurism. I can't deny that, however, I think this balance arises more from the nature of the instrument useda modern synthesizerfor a drama set in the 1920s. This anachronism results in an ironic pleasure separate from whatever dramatic and aesthetic value the actual music possesses, similar to Woody Allen inversely placing 1920s slapstick in the context of a futuristic dystopia in ""Sleeper"". <br/><br/>I could have forgiven the film's reliance on context if it had of managed to harness the inherent self-referential power of its scenarios, but it did not. We have a staggering number of scenes that revolve around the notion of performing for an audience (the essence of film). Not just the races, but a play, a sermon, a lecture, a memorial, a training session, a musical numberand no hint of self-awareness, no leveraging of the idea that this film itself is a performance for an audience. Instead we get a straight story only, drearily oblivious that it too, like its characters, is driven by the political, theoretical, and technological machinery behind it."

","It's been a year since London is being awarded as host for the 2012 Olympics. I know this all too well, because it was announced from here in my country a year ago. The man responsible for bringing the biggest sporting event on Earth to London (six years from now, given now a year has passed since) is also the one who once reenact the scene (the running scene on Cambridge grounds between Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams) with his then-rival on the track Steve Ovett - Sebastian Coe. Interestingly back then when I was reading and checking about his life as the Olympic runner, this movie's name surfaced.<br/><br/>This is how it all began. Very interesting way of how I learnt of this movie.<br/><br/>This is based on the real-life story of the lives on a British Jew (Harold Abrahams) and a Scottish Christian (Eric Liddell) in leading to the 1928 Olympics in Paris. One who run for the sake of removing those prejudices against fellow Jews like him, and the other who did it for the sake of his religion. Their lives crossed each other many a times, from the time of their Cambridge days. Liddell even made a radical decision not to participate in a race which was supposed to be held on a Sunday when the Olympics was going on at that time. Doing it for the sake of his religion.<br/><br/>A moving and inspirational story where people do a common thing (in the case here, the Olympics) for the sake of very different reasons. The opening theme to the movie...I so know at once it's the one where it is often used for mega events like the Olympics. One of those tunes which still kept giving me goosebumps whenever I hear it! <br/><br/>This movie - definitely really recommended."

","A vivid, exciting testament to man's spirit and will to succeed, 1981's ""Chariots Of Fire"" belies expectations one might have about a film set in fusty, honor-bound post-World War I Great Britain and featuring perhaps the dullest of sports disciplines, track and field. With the possible exception of ""Rocky,"" I can't think of a more thrilling, satisfying sports film.<br/><br/>At Cambridge University, Harold Abrahams runs to exalt himself and force his acceptance in a society he admires but at the same time resents for the way it holds him at bay for his being Jewish. Meanwhile, on the other end of that same sceptered isle, a Scottish athlete preparing for a career as a missionary in faraway China emerges as Abrahams' nearest rival, though Eric Liddell runs for quite different reasons, feeling God's pleasure in his speed and a way of using his athleticism to promote his faith in an increasingly Darwinian world. These twin, competing drives, each exemplary in its own way, find their common culmination at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris.<br/><br/>""Chariots Of Fire"" was the surprise winner of the 1982 Best Picture Oscar, and unlike other Oscar winners from that decade and others, it seems in its own quiet way to gain in stature with the passage of time. A lot of what makes ""Chariots Of Fire"" great is immediately apparent, like the sumptuous period detail and the Vangelis score, including the engaging title music that had its own remarkable underdog run to the top of the U.S. pop chart. A source of ready, recognizable parody, the opening scene of the British runners striding across a windswept strand in slow motion is as gripping today as it was 25 years ago, when it inspired a generation of overweight middle-aged people to put on their Nikes and give jogging a try.<br/><br/>Some other things that make ""Chariots Of Fire"" great become a little clearer with multiple viewings. Take the Oscar-nominated editing by Terry Rawlings. ""Chariots Of Fire"" is epic in scope, and seems to take its time developing in much the same encompassing way as ""The Right Stuff"" would do with the Mercury astronaut program a couple of years later. Yet while that later film is over three hours long, ""Chariots Of Fire"" weighs in at just over two hours, slow motion and all.<br/><br/>Oddly, neither Ben Cross as Abrahams nor Ian Charleson as Liddell were nominated for Oscars. Both would have been deserving nominees. Cross provides an empathetic center as Abrahams, really the nominal star of the film, and a source of tension as he deals with the contempt of his social superiors both for being Jewish and for hiring a professional coach, Sam Mussabini. (Ian Holm, the only acting nominee, though he lost to John Gielgud, who plays one of the disapproving Cambridge dons here and won for his engaging if one-note performance as the butler in ""Arthur."")<br/><br/>Cross gives a great, layered reading, but I'm simply in awe of Charleson's quiet embodiment of the Christian ideal as Liddell, especially the rainy scene after a meet where he addresses a working-class crowd about faith: ""Then where does the power come from, to see the race to its end? From within."" The way the sun pokes out as he finishes his address is spine-tingling, but not any more so than the commanding yet humble gaze with which Liddell takes in his audience.<br/><br/>That's the message of the film, really. It helps to have a good pair of legs, but the greatest bodies are nothing without being infused by true spirit. When Liddell refuses to wilt under the pressure of his country's prince, who asks him to break faith with his beliefs and compete in a Sunday meet, it's the film's greatest moment of triumph, underscored by the words of a sympathetic noble: ""His speed is a mere extension of his life, its force. We sought to sever his running from himself."" So instead we see Liddell address a church congregation while the games go on, and his words are mixed with scenes of triumph and defeat. One single image frozen in my mind shows the film's narrator, the likable Montague, losing his big race, his face contorted in rage and pain, while Liddell's voice intones: ""They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint.""<br/><br/>There are some dry moments in the film, and the romance between Abrahams and a young singer feels tacked on for female appeal, but given that women compete as much as men do these days, in sports and elsewhere, the overall message of ""Chariots Of Fire"" feels more welcome and enveloping now than ever. Winning is a great thing, but reaching your true potential is the real race worth running."

","This Best Picture is certainly gripping and unusual.  At the time of its theatrical release, its soundtrack was well received despite its unusual electronic elements.  However, I believe the contrast between the two major characters is what drives the movie's narrative forward!  Surprisingly, Liddell and Abrahams are not headed toward a climactic ""fight-to-the-death,"" as most big recent films would have staged such contrast.  They, however,are pioneers of a sort and exemplary world-class athletes.  I recommend the film to young viewers because the philosophical approaches to competition are so well-drawn.  Do you win ""because winning is the only thing""?  One of the leading characters says ""No,"" and most Americans are befuddled at such a philosophy.  It calls into question so much of our consumer-mad obsession with sports and winning.  CHARIOTS OF FIRE is a ""10"" for me because it dares to slow down its races and put ""the microphone"" in behind the scene conversations that tell all about post World War I society.  It is also notable as one of the projects that Princess Diana of England's doomed ""boyfriend"" Dodie Fayed managed to bring to fruition."

But many other movies have this problem, and I never heard anyone say that such things as the Thin Red Line or Schindler's List (just to mention a couple) are boring or whatsoever.<br/><br/>Chariots of Fire is an epic tale about honor, pride and sportsmanship, it is the story of a group of men and their dreams, and shows what sport was really about, before business and money came in. Characters like Eric Liddell, Harold Abrahams and Andrew Lindsay really have a lot to teach to those who still believe that competing and doing your best is better than winning without putting your heart in it.<br/><br/>Maybe you'll need to spend more than a night watching it, and drink some coffee too...
