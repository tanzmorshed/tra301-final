","Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance - boy, what an impact he had. <br/><br/>Now, that was 40 years ago - but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?<br/><br/>As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody).<br/><br/>Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach - and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets). <br/><br/>The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature - is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story.<br/><br/>After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled.Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached. <br/><br/>Ultimately - despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale - 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did - you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!""<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","If Jaws was released today, everyone would complain how it took too long for the shark to turn up. WHAT HAPPENED TO ATTENTION SPANS?!<br/><br/>When I saw it in the cinema people couldn't even get through the opening credits without being on their phones. These are the same type of people who complain about how the human characters are dull (Yet the 1998 Godzilla characters were too ridiculous) but tell you off for saying the same thing about Pacific Rim, saying ""But I just want to see action""<br/><br/>The people who complain about there being too little action also complain about how Transformers has too much action. The people who complain about Cranston not being in it enough complain about movies using popular actors just to get people to watch it. The people who complain about it being dark and realistic complain about the Marvel movies being too light and unrealistic.<br/><br/>The people who complain about this movie are whiny, hypocritical and missed one of the most beautifully choreographed movies, with the most impressive visuals even when the monsters weren't on screen, a great soundtrack that inspired terror and a cast that although lacking in the third act, made up for a great introduction and middle (Cranston and Watanabe) and some of the most epic-scaled action I have seen in the last 10 years. Cloverfield was a shaky mess that wasted the monster and Pacific Rim had sporadic fights that gave no real sense of scale.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the many sequels that will most likely have a lot more Godzilla now they are confident (given the box office)to use more CGI and money. He will be fighting some of the most iconic villains from the Godzilla universe, and hopefully all the idiots who watched and hated this movie won't watch it and me all the people who cheered through the first one will get to watch it in peace."
"matthew-rehlinger","7","584","930","15 May 2014"," Godzilla 2014: Should You Watch It?
","Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the '98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami's Spiderman series.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as ""District 9"" and the Korean film ""The Host,"" this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I've ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that's your thing.<br/><br/>Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston's role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else's performance was similarly forgettable.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I've also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. All told, depending on which camp you fall under, this will be an entirely different movie for you. As Godzilla movies go, I'd give it a B. As darker, more serious monster movies go, I'd give it a D+."

","So, I should start by saying, I went to this move not expecting a lot. My husband wanted to see it, however, so off we go.. Dear Lord, I think I'm going to find the sappiest chic flick available (even if its torturous for me to sit through) just to get payback for him making me sit through 2 hours of this crap. At least the popcorn was good!!<br/><br/>I liked Godzilla himself.. But, I think out of the entire 123 minutes, you see him only 20 minutes, maybe? And most of that is just watching his spiky back in the water as he swims. The rest of this movie is watching the main actor, who, in my opinion, has about as much acting depth as Kristen Stewart, look like a total tool. The shining grace, I thought, was that this movie had Ken Watanabe in it. I like Watanabe but even he looked like he was suffering from a bad case of the Taco Bell revenge and couldn't find a bathroom for the entire movie.<br/><br/>I spent the majority of this movie picking out dumb stuff that just amounts to bad writing. Example: Okay, the two bad monsters (which, in my opinion resemble a cross between those white strider things that the muppets ride in ""The Dark Crystal"" with a bit of ""Aliens"" thrown in to make them somewhat scary?) have the ability of creating EMPs, killing all electronics and causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.. We learn this early on in the movie, probably in the first 30 minutes. Think the military learns their lesson?? Nope, lets continuously throw about 600 billion dollars worth of F-35s and Battleships in the mix just so we can have it continuously plummet into the water. Another example: They know these muppet hybrids like to eat Radioactive materials and I guess can smell it. And hey, there's one making its way from Vegas to San Fransisco. So lets strap a huge bomb on a train and slowly move it from Vegas to San Fransisco along the same exact path that the critter is going. What kinda harm could that cause? Its not like the thing would smell it on the train and come after it, right? And why is it, the military storms into a radioactive storage facility but has no clue that an entire half of mountain has just been blasted out by muppet hybrid #2 (who's much bigger than #1) and this 30 story tall critter is somehow making its way towards Vegas completely undetected? <br/><br/>And while we're on the subject of the bomb, what the heck is up with the ""breeding"" of the two muppet hybrids anyway?? You got a male, you got a female (complete with some glowy bulging egg sac thing that they give us a really good closeup of.. They meet up to reproduce.. which involves the male giving the female the long, phallic shaped, radioactive bomb which she then rubs between her legs all over this glowy egg sac.. WtF?? How the heck did these things breed before mankind started making huge phallic shaped missiles anyway? <br/><br/>Oh..Did I mention the acting was bad?? I don't recall liking ANY of the characters, with exception to the dad (played by Bryan Cranston) and he dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are characters that seem to have no purpose whatsoever besides trying to find a way to fill a 2 hour movie with irrelevant fluff. Lil Asian boy on the elevated train in Hawaii? Didn't see any point to him.. The main characters wife and little boy?? Added nothing to the story to be honest. (And what military wife who knows her husband is in danger isn't waiting by the phone for news? Nope, phones ringing and she's doing whatever.. Or tells her co-worker she's unavailable?) The acting had no depth to it, everyone came off very flat and honestly, unlikable. There's no emotion whatsoever. Hey, a couple of muppet hybrids are destroying our city, oh well. A huge Godzilla is barreling towards our aircraft carrier? Don't panic.. lets stand at the guardrail and watch it peacefully because any emotion such as fear would be too much to ask.<br/><br/>Pretty sad when the most exciting thing about this movie is a bird hitting the bus window.. Although, to be honest, the CGI on the actual fight between Godzilla and the muppet hybrids was nice, the whole 5 minutes it lasted. Then, Godzilla jumps in the water and the credits roll. Best part of the whole movie.. Compared to the other 121 minutes of this movie, the credits are the best 2 minutes overall."
"taner-ali","1","745","1210","15 May 2014"," Utterly contemptible
","This film has no plot. I wouldn't have an issue with this if instead they had filled most of the two hours with scenes of Godzilla destroying things and killing people. However, the monster himself receives a pathetic amount of screen time, only appearing halfway through the film after the plot has already focused its attention on two giant bugs. They are unimaginatively designed, have no basis in Japanese mythology like the titular monster, and their only purpose seems to be to diminish the impressiveness of Godzilla. The character development in this film is non-existent. Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood cliché. Unlike the viewers, the film believes its characters are fascinating enough to merit the laughably corny near-death and family- reunion scenes towards the end. Instead, the audience is left laughing in bemusement at the overly sincere expressions on the protagonist's face as he threatens a giant monster with a handgun. Whenever Godzilla and the insects finally begin to fight, before anything happens there's an instant cut to yet another tedious shot of US soldiers shouting about nothing in particular. The film's sole purpose is to showcase the might of America's armed forces and ability to survive under a crisis; and it doesn't even do that well, given that the navy can't even tell when Godzilla is swimming directly under their ships. Of course, setting the story in Godzilla's homeland of Japan would not interest American viewers, so the monster decides to swim across the Pacific Ocean in order to wreak havoc. No doubt Godzilla will receive acclaim from morons due to its high-tech but utterly unimaginative animation techniques. However, this film's cutting-edge CGI does not justify its lack of plot, excitement and meaningful characters."
"canadian58","10","123","194","14 November 2014"," In a word...EPIC!
","I wasn't going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10"
"rasmushelms","3","471","796","28 May 2014"," A Tedious, Heartless Film
","For fans of monster movies, ""Godzilla"" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.<br/><br/>The plot in ""Godzilla"" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film's titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film's focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.<br/><br/>Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Godzilla"" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie. I just didn't care how things would turn out."
"alva3901","8","40","59","25 June 2016"," A great entry into the Godzilla franchise
","Godzilla has been a movie icon for over sixty years, emerging from the deep oceans and causing havoc in cities across the world. This new depiction of the great kaiju, acting as a reboot of the franchise and directed by an up-and-coming director, Gareth Edwards, is a very entertaining film despite the complaints of there being too little of Godzilla. I somewhat concur with this argument, however, having seen many of Japanese films, especially the original in 1954, it is known for Godzilla to be teased throughout the movie (or have limited screen time), yet still have a profound impact on the film and the audience it is delivered to, and this is what the 2014 version does very well. However, at times, it did come at an annoyance when right as we see him, the scene changes. But this should not take away from otherwise a really good film. <br/><br/>The design of Godzilla and the monstrous villains, the MUTOs, were very well created and augmented to represent a respectable scale to real world buildings/infrastructure. As usual, the action scenes were a blast, with the final act dedicated to the fight we've been waiting for between the creatures. <br/><br/>The plot carried the film smoothly, coupled with some good acting from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn. But it should be noted that the good acting came from secondary characters while our central character, Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, was very bland and one-dimensional. The film was an attempt at very human orientated monster film rather than focused on the monsters themselves, which is somewhat of a problem in a movie called ""Godzilla"". However, Gareth Edwards blends both well enough to not detract what this film manages to accomplish. <br/><br/>With the news of a Monsterverse being created by Legendary Studious, involving the likes of King Kong, I am very excited to see where they take Godzilla in his next movie in 2019, where he will pit off against his greatest foes, King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan, before taking on King Kong in 2020 to determine who the real ""King"" is."
"Critomaton","1","302","531","19 May 2014"," Godzilla falls flat on his face, even in 3D
","Where do I begin? Nothing in this movie works. The 3D effects are the worst I've ever seen. In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen. It's almost as if the director pre-rendered the movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000... <br/><br/>There are lots of other monster scenes where some minor object (broken window pane, windshield wiper, train passenger, etc.) gets in the way in a botched attempt to create depth. It never works - the monsters always seem fake and flat.<br/><br/>Nothing about the plot makes any sense. We're to believe the monsters could completely obliterate a nuclear power plant without being noticed. Then, when they re-appear after 15 years (couldn't they have waited a few more years like the cicadas?), they can effortlessly elude radar tracking, satellite imagery, and a hundred million iPhones and just sneak around, silently munching on nuclear submarines. We're also to believe that nobody is really sure whether Godzilla is friend or foe, so the U.S. Navy will arbitrarily alternate between sailing right next to him and shooting at him with rockets. <br/><br/>With all of the nuclear power plants in the country, which are like catnip to these suckers, somehow a major plot element involves luring the monsters away from population centers with a single nuclear weapon on a train.<br/><br/>The score is so loud, intrusive, and overly dramatic it's mind-numbing.<br/><br/>The M.U.T.O.s (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are as generic and uninspired as you could possibly imagine. Just think of every mantis-shaped bug you've ever seen in any movie, and that's them. Throughout the entire movie I was distracted trying to remember where I'd seen them before - and I just remembered, they're a rip-off from Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>Every time a monster fight scene starts, it ends abruptly before anything interesting happens. In this movie, Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco supposedly get destroyed, but you can't really tell and won't really care. I think maybe 60 seconds was spent on the destruction of Honolulu and about 30 seconds on Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The guy from Kick-Ass (I can't be bothered to look up his name) plays a giant walking cliché. So do half of the Olsen Twins (edit - it wasn't until I lost a bet over the cast of Avengers: Infinity War that I learned that Elizabeth Olsen is a sister of the Full House Twins, not one of them. Sorry Elizabeth. This movie still sucks). So do two - count 'em two - precocious endangered kids.<br/><br/>The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of the dumbest I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure that bridge wasn't designed to hold a bunch of M1 tanks and - even if it was - they probably wouldn't be in a traffic jam with busloads of kids. I still can't figure out whether the bus driver was supposed to be a hero or a maniac for trying to mow down every pedestrian/soldier/policeman on the bridge just to save the walking cliché's son. And all those ships in the bay! Toy ships dropped in a bathtub would have a more organized formation.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter that Godzilla isn't in the movie that much. You'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter that Bryan Cranston dies early on in the movie - you'll just want the movie to be over. It doesn't matter whether Admiral David Strathairn gets his SitReps from the TV news instead of looking out his window at the 600-foot-tall monster. You'll just want the movie to be over.<br/><br/>It doesn't even matter that military people repeatedly ""pronounce out"" A.S.A.P. even though in real life they'd probably just say ""AY-sap"". You'll just want the movie to be over A.S.A.F.P.<br/><br/>I think what bothers me the most is the overuse of helicopters. I mean, I love helicopters. Blue Thunder is one of my favorite movies and Airwolf was my favorite TV show. I don't watch Westerns because there aren't enough helicopters in them. But the excessive use of helicopters in this movie made even me want to scream ""Enough with the helicopters, we get it, you can make them look 3D! Too bad you couldn't do that with the giant monsters!""<br/><br/>Honestly, this latest installment of Godzilla is just as unwatchable as the Emmerich brothers' fiasco, and even Godzilla 1985 was more interesting.<br/><br/>To those positive reviewers who claim that it's not fair to compare this to Pacific Rim because they're different kinds of movies, I say: You are correct. Pacific Rim is an enjoyable, well done monster movie with good effects, and Godzilla is the exact opposite."

And everybody I mean whole cinema.<br/><br/>First 20-30 minutes were watchable. It was looking to be a solid movie, but after that everything goes wrong. And I mean everything... Bad dialog's; good music in very bad moments and several styles of it; main character immortal; American happy ending style; no logic in this movie anywhere; many mistakes noticeable for everyone...<br/><br/>If a Uwe Boll have more money, he will make this movie better. When I was watching Sharknado, I was less shocked by stupidity like in this movie. It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you want to punish yourself."

","This is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. A torture. I could barely stay still on my sit. I almost left the room 1 hour before the end. But I stayed, hoping for something good to happen. But something good never happened and the ending is even worst that my worst expectations.<br/><br/>The trailer was such a lie. I was expecting something dark, mysterious and brainy. Something like The Dark Knight. Instead it's only military crap, dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism. Makes me sick. The movie dies with Bryan Cranston. The only problem is that his part doesn't last half an hour.<br/><br/>Godzilla wasn't an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. It was just sh*t."
"phd_travel","10","72","118","19 May 2014"," See this on the big screen - it's worth it
","This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.<br/><br/>Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.<br/><br/>The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.<br/><br/>The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.<br/><br/>Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch."
"bob the moo","Null","79","132","5 October 2014"," Although effects and sound are technically impressive, it is quite unsatisfying and superficial
","I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.<br/><br/>The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.<br/><br/>On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value."

But this movie, I know that all the long time fan's like myself will watch it over on over again. I will go back to the movies next week to see it again. Can't wait for the Blu- ray. I honestly do not see what all the haters of this movie are thinking. It's a Monster movie. Plain and simple. For 2 hours I was entertained. I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things. But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE.

Roar of Godzilla and other monsters makes you thrill.In movie i think i saw Godzilla just about 20-30 minutes, but when i saw ,it was cool.That few minutes was enough for my expectations..(sorry for my English mistakes)"
"malekrodeen","10","365","698","15 May 2014"," Not really a review but an explanation towards all the critics...
","Critics have lost their way. They have rated this film average/below average because they dislike the tease of Godzilla in the movie and say an improvement would be having him centre stage every scene he's in. When you look back to some of the greatest, most tense horror/sci-fi films like Jaws or Alien, you will see that they don't always show the creature from the start, but little snippets, building tension throughout the movie. They call this a B-movie because they enter the screening with the mindset that its cheesy because they don't understand the meaning behind Gojira itself, making it sound like just another monster movie when it's not. The fans are speaking out, showing their appreciation for the movie and love for the view Gareth is giving Godzilla, but the critics do not. Never listen to them; their opinions don't stand for the millions that actually GET what the director was trying to establish here.<br/><br/>Also, if you're a monster movie type of person, go see this. If you're not, don't go see it. It is that simple. Don't go judging on how bad an actor is in a film when you can't even memorize a single line. Don't go writing a review that is completely biased just because you do not know the concept and origin of Godzilla. Half of these reviews are trolls anyway so it is best to ignore them (and including me if I sound ignorant). If you like monsters or Godzilla, go see it and make up your mind. If you don't, then spend your money on something else."
"krober-fw","10","37","61","16 May 2014"," The Big Guy is back and he is BAD!!!!!
","Old memories never die. I was living in Tokyo in 1954 the year that Godzilla first appeared and destroyed most of the City. It is something that I have never forgotten to this day. OK I know this guy is nuts. I was not even alive in 1954. I saw the Movie when it came out Thursday Night and had to sleep on it. After absorbing it all in I think I can say that I really liked the Movie and think that most Movie goers especially hard core Godzilla fans will like this Movie. Give it a shot and see what you think. I have seen every Godzilla Movie that I can get my hands on and think that this may be my favourite. Now we will have to wait and see if they will recycle any of the other Japanese Monsters. Gamera, Mothra or any others."

","In my opinion, this movie was insane. Godzilla was not really that much in the movie, but when he was he kicked ass!<br/><br/>I don't understand people bitching about the movie wasn't like pacific rim. I liked Pacific rim, but i think it was a good idea to make something different. This monsterfilm is much more realistic, and is much, much better made (CGI). In my opinion Godzilla was way better than Pacific rim.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston appears in the trailer like he is the main character but he dies in the beginning of the movie, which i think is really misleading. He's son takes the spot, and must travel from Japan to U.S.A to get his family away from the danger. The son (Ford Brody) is a very boring character because we don't see him so much and he doesn't seem very sensitive.<br/><br/>In the end Godzilla actually saved mankind and just go in to the ocean and swim away, which i think was a really unpredictable ending.<br/><br/>So don't watch this movie if you just want some meaningless monsterfight. Watch it because you wanna se a ""realistic"" movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat - With monsters in it.<br/><br/>And this was the best CGI i have ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>(Godzilla has atomic breath)"

","Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!"
"mark-allsop","1","185","356","20 May 2014"," Did I See The Right Movie??
","This is the first time I've seen a movie and felt cheated  genuinely cheated and lied to! The reason is because 90% of the trailers depicted Godzilla as a threat, something to fear, the city levelling monster we all know and love. The trailers were very good at misleading me to think that it was Godzilla that made all that mess in the woods, tearing that train in half, causing that fire ball at the airport  but none of this was to be! It turns out that Godzilla is a boy scout who protects us innocent little humans when the, apparently very incompetent, Navy boys are busy miss firing their highest grade weapons at a bridge full of school buses.<br/><br/>At least we get to see Cranston do his thing though! A favourite actor of mine and almost everyone else in the world!  One of the reasons I wanted to see this movie! The great Brian Cranston vs. Godzilla! He will be so good in this film! He's amazing ""it wasn't a typhoon!"" oh I'm getting Goosebumps! ... *10 minutes later* ... Nuts!!! Whatever! I could deal with that, but another major flaw is Godzilla's origin story in his own (First) movie  it's taken care of by a couple of pictures and some real smart person telling us that he's been around all this time, sleeping in the drink! Now this only feels like a slap in the face to the fans when you realise how much time and effort was put into the origins of the big, evil, baby having insect. The whole first half of the film is dedicated to the 'bad guy' alone!  Why did the filmmakers think we'd care that much?? I guess I could also deal with that too  it's a Godzilla movie; surely we'll be treated with some awesome action scenes between the two/three monsters throughout!  right?? Wrong! The first fight, for whatever reason, cuts away before we see anything good and all we get is a glimpse on a telly  The second fight? The same gosh darn thing happens! Just as Godzilla stands up in the city with his best 'come at me, bro' pose and just as you finally sit up and think ""finally! Something good is going to happen!""  it cuts away to something far less exciting!  *rolls eyes* And I guess I could maybe deal with that too  I could deal with all that stuff and forgive the movie if it had an outstanding climax! You know, something worthy of the ""King of Monsters""  but this was not to be  I found myself glaring at a dark blank screen that was supposed to be the climactic battle having no idea what I was looking at  half why through the ""fight"" I finally realised something that broke my heart  this was a bad movie. A bad movie I'd been looking forward to since the first teaser.<br/><br/>The film ended. I had a quick power cry during the credits  and my brother and I left the cinema wearing our black ties due to the death of our childlike hopes 'n' dreams we had while walking into the screen 2 hours beforehand.<br/><br/>See it if you must! By which I mean someone puts a gun to your head, walks you to the cinema, buys the tickets and sits next to you the entire time with his pistol pressed firmly against your temple.<br/><br/>Otherwise, save your moneys and time.<br/><br/>Peace."
"Niks234","10","44","76","16 May 2014"," Awesome movie
","Godzilla was absolutely amazing. The graphics, storyline, and characters all created a positive attribute to the movie. The director did a great job in reincarnating the movie in 2014. The graphics were more than I expected as detail was put to Godzilla, which at first going into the movie I thought would be different. Then there are the MUTO monsters who were also detailed. Moving on to the storyline, it was easy to follow and understand what was happening compared to other recent movies I have watched. The characters or the actors nailed each role which helped the movie become better. I would also like to note the soundtracks used for the movie were awesome. Overall the movie was excellent and I recommend that you watch it."
"josephfrench12345","10","338","670","9 May 2014"," Godzilla, tears of joy
","First, let me just say the cgi in this film just blows my mind. I have never seen it done as well as this, this was like Pacific Rim times five. I thought this movie would be a joke, until I saw it, but now I can believe I even thought that. overall just a beautiful film, one for the records, your pal John. The acting by Bryan Cranstons is as good as Breaking Bad, and should win some awards. Yes the movie has some awkward scenes with some bad acting but overall I could barely tell. This movie is like the Dark Night, just great action shots, really wish I could see it again. Overall, this is going in my collection, great movie recommend it to everyone."
"Gemma-ledbury","10","27","44","25 May 2014"," Godzilla 2014: a must-see for any Godzilla fans!
","So I just got back from Godzilla...<br/><br/>Okay so I'm a bit hype from just seeing it, so I need to calm down, yet Godzilla was such an amazing movie with incredible effects and a simple yet awesome storyline! The movie director has obviously stayed true to the original Godzilla, equipped with atomic breath and spikes that glow blue, a long tail and a spine-tingling roar! Just before you read on, SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>What do you think of when I say Godzilla? The king of monsters destroying Japan, right? Well this movie totally flipped the tables and made Godzilla more of a ""saviour"" of Earth. However, he was only hunting the Muto monster pair, not protecting humanity, yet he wasn't destroying humanity either. He was more chaotic neutral in this movie, but that's a good thing! Instead of aimlessly destroying things, Godzilla only destroyed things by falling on them or throwing the Muto into them whilst fighting, he didn't strive to destroy humanity, we humans were only in the way.<br/><br/>People may complain that there is no enough footage of Godzilla, but I think it's good that film directors can focus on something else other than Godzilla destroying stuff, we've had enough Godzilla movies of him knocking down Mach-5 air jets and stepping on cars, so it was pretty awesome to see that the movie was more based on the human element rather than the monster element. It's a change for the better.<br/><br/>People complained that the acting wasn't good, but I think it was, and people are probably only saying that because the actors involved in the movie weren't well known or that famous. If it had been Brad Pitt acting everyone would of said the acting was amazing.<br/><br/>I liked how the monsters also showed emotion, like Godzilla and how he seemed sad when he knew he was dying, and the female Muto when she realised all her children had just gone up in flames. Godzilla didn't die by the way, guys, it just seemed like he did. But then he got up, let out a fearsome roar and made his way back into the Ocean as if saying ""See you next movie, guys!"". I really liked how the Muto died. The male Muto (seeing as he was very small compared to Godzilla) got crushed by Godzilla, and the female Muto took a atomic breath to the throat before Godzilla ripped her head off and threw it into the water. The characters also seemed like they had some sort of connection with Godzilla. For example, when the main character realised that Godzilla was about to get double-teamed by the two Muto, he used A LOT of fuel to blow up all the Muto eggs, resulting in both Muto ditching Godzilla to go see what had happened.<br/><br/>My favourite moment was when the female Muto was about to destroy the boat carrying the atomic bomb. Everyone thought Godzilla was dead at this point, and it seemed hopeless. Until Godzilla came out of no where and preformed a fatality on the helpless Muto.<br/><br/>So overall, I thought it was an amazing, epic entry to the series! It's a MUST-SEE for any Godzilla fans, as I'm planning on going and watching it a second time.<br/><br/>I'm so glad this didn't turn out like the 1998 Godzilla, I was kinda worried it would be just another revamp of Godzilla when I was walking into the cinema, but I came out almost in tears from the awesomeness I had just experienced."
"purenxk","10","259","509","13 May 2014"," Godzilla - The TRUE King of the Monsters is born...
","Godzilla has found a true admirer in Gareth Edwards. Someone who set out not only to envision a new future for Godzilla but to protect the previous Godzilla's long 60 year history, a man capable of delivering a Godzilla for our time. After seeing Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' it is my opinion that he has succeeded in mastering the vision for the monster that Tomoyuki Tanaka had in mind 60 years ago. Even though the original Godzilla will always be just that - the original, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is for me the first TRUE and complete representation of the vision of Godzilla. Executed in the most masterful of ways in direction by Gareth Edwards and in overall story by Max Borenstein. In delivering the picture that he has Gareth Edwards has completely put to shame directors such as Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, Zack Snyder and the other go-to blockbuster directors. Injecting a surprising amount of suspense into this 'Godzilla' Gareth's Godzilla will have you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath in anticipation of what is next to come - something a Godzilla movie has not done since 1984. Unlike many of the reviews that I have read, I found the pacing of this movie to be absolutely fine, in fact I would have personally preferred a few more opportunities to catch my breath and gather my wits. Gareth Edwards has clearly given Godzilla the strongest opportunity for continued box office presence that he has ever had in the United States (although the burden of that task in my opinion seems almost insurmountable - and in all honesty - I would prefer to see this 'Godzilla' remain as it is, a superior standalone). A rebirth of epic (but not overwhelming) proportions this Godzilla harks back to the radiated and devastated scenes of Tokyo in Tomoyuki Tanaka and Ishiro Honda's original 1954 'Gojira' capturing with somber respect and sadness the human toll in stark contrast to most summer blockbuster movies in recent memory (especially 'Man of Steel' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness') Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein can now rightfully join the likes of Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and Eiji Tsuburaya as masters of Godzilla."
"BrentHankins","8","121","229","14 May 2014"," The film 'Godzilla' fans have been dreaming of.
","It's been 60 years since Godzilla first appeared on screen, emerging from the ocean to wreak havoc on the city of Tokyo. Since then, we've seen the big guy transition from antagonist to hero and back again, with the bulk of his cinematic adventures featuring battles against other gargantuan monsters. But the creature was always at his best when he was portrayed as neither hero nor villain, but a terrifying, unstoppable force of nature, which is precisely what director Gareth Edwards seeks to emulate in this highly anticipated reimagining.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1999, with nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) researching a strange pattern of seismic activity that could threaten the stability of the power plant where he and his wife (Juliette Binoche) are employed. While officials dismiss the readings as aftershocks from an earthquake in the Philippines, Joe suspects otherwise, but a tragic accident levels the entire facility, splintering the Brody family and leaving Joe unable to complete his research.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, the area surrounding the plant is still under quarantine, and Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is summoned to Japan to retrieve his father, who was arrested while trying to sneak into the family's old home. Joe has become obsessed with discovering the source of the accident, and his current research indicates that the same incident that destroyed his life is on the verge of happening again. Ford reluctantly agrees to help out his old man, and before long the duo find themselves back at the site of the accident, where the Japanese government is hiding something big. Something very big.<br/><br/>Godzilla refuses to follow the pattern of other tentpole releases, which would no doubt have major action beats about every 10 minutes. Instead, Edwards pulls inspiration from the Jurassic Park formula, slowly ratcheting up the tension and doling out the big reveals in smaller doses. He also wisely showcases nearly every bit of action from eye- level, giving us a uniquely human perspective on the breathtaking scope of the destruction and keeping the audience invested in the plight of the regular-sized characters.<br/><br/>The film has a few minor issues, most notably a slew of immensely talented actors being reduced to one-note performances in supporting roles, and a somewhat silly explanation of the big guy's origin, but in the grand scheme of things none of this really matters. What does matter is that fans have finally been given the Godzilla film they've been dreaming of, one that honors the memory of the original while erasing the painful memory of Roland Emmerich's 1999 attempt. Edwards has created a tense, thrilling tale generously sprinkled with jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring moments, a film that takes itself and its history very seriously, and gets just about everything right."
"antsmiff","1","229","453","17 May 2014"," Even worse than the 1998 version.
","Worse film ever! save your money and don't go. Godzilla is only in the film for a maximum of 10 minutes, the rest of the 90 minutes or so, that I lost of my life, is filled with mediocre acting that was about as exciting as treading on an upturned plug with no shoes on. I got the impression that the majority of the budget was spent on the sets and actors, leaving the effects for Godzilla until last, which resulted in him having minimal time in the film. Literally, up until the 70 minute mark, you only saw a tail and a few spines from his back. When a headshot finally materialised, it was only for a matter of seconds. I genuinely feel short changed and would strongly recommend that anyone planning to see the film should wait for it to come out on DVD."

","I meant to stay home to do laundry and clip my toe nails. Compared to this movie, that would have been a click-my-heels day filled with delight and wonder. And, I would've been 10 bucks richer. After watching this disappointing, would-be flick, i had to go to confession and ask for forgiveness for being, yet again, a gullible, wasteful consumer. I said two hail Mary's and watched Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>Where to begin..Godzilla 98 gets a bad rap...for what? Many of those reviews amounted to pretentious, unsubstantiated horse Shiite. That movie towers over this one like a KaiJu crapping on the naive, hapless rabble that see this movie.<br/><br/>Do not be taken in by the shills who are paid to fill these pages with paid, pseudo-positive reviews. The financiers, Et Al, of this multi-million dollar mess have a band of callused-fingered monkeys hard at work trying to convince you to throw away your hard-earned dollars on this remake.<br/><br/>I was concerned this would be a snooze fest from the get-go. Suspicion confirmed when the director kills off his only other main asset, besides the g-man, within the first 15 Min's. i e, Bryan Cranston. Way to go. I would've blamed the writers for that genius decision but the director controls the story -and, the lifespan of the actors.<br/><br/>Pop Quiz : What's worse than a b-movie starring a guy in a giant lizard suit? Answer : A $160 million dollar flick starring a cgi-guy in a lizard suit.<br/><br/>What gives? A director with cutting-edge technology and a Jillian dollars at his disposal thinks it's about time we get a cgi equivalent of a man in rubber monster costume. And, to add insult to injury, they made him look like an everest-sized couch potato. Yet, another example of how the makers of Godzilla '98 got it right. They gave us a mean, lean intelligent monster. Now, that was a movie designed to entertain. That freak was like the ultimate-fighting Godzilla, running circles around the brainless American military. <br/><br/>This godzilla, apparently, was awakend from a beer-drinking, donut-eating binge due to an A-bomb that woke him up and made him look for a job. Namely, clocking two low-tech tarantulas with an over-stimulated pituitary gland. They probably woke him up from his nap so he decided to have at it with them and do a quick beer-run while he was up.<br/><br/>They could've named this flick, ""The Monster Beer Gut that Belched on Las Vegas"".<br/><br/>This movie had very little action. What-the-EF? This is not suppose to be a hallmark channel movie. It's a friggin' monster movie!! Hello! The key word in that sentence? Monster! Where was he? They got the g-man hiding out for the majority of the movie! And, when they finally decide to grace us with his presence it's only for a few minutes. Mind-boggling. I recommend you watch Pacific Rim and Godzilla '98 for some solid monster entertainment.<br/><br/>Don't even ask me about the transparent plot. Wait. Did i say plot? I meant filler material. We've all seen this many times before. Predictable story line, executed by over-used or under-used performers. Take your pick. Hero has a beef with parent/child/love-interest. Then, comes around after it's too late, only to save the day. Ever watch an adult flick with a 90 min build up to a 10 second money shot. Bingo. Only I'm still waiting for the payoff.<br/><br/>A person can take just so much of a hand-wringing scientist or a whimpering, clingy wife etc. If you've seen the trailer you've seen too much. This flick belongs on the Saturday morning line-up for 4-year-olds. It's that dull.<br/><br/>Tip of the Day : Go to the theater. Watch a nice, enjoyable movie. Then, during a bathroom break, sneak over to catch the last few minutes of Godzilla. That way, you've seen the whole movie, you've only wasted 5 Min's of your life -and, it's free."
"zamfir_paul90","10","52","93","23 August 2014"," Don't understand why people hate this movie
","As I was reading through the other reviews I noticed one thing. People have split (mostly) into two camps. In one camp you can find those that utterly hate the movie, and in the other one you find those that adore it. Weird enough, there were very little that were in between the two camps.<br/><br/>Let's talk about why people hated this movie. From what I have read those that hated the movie, hated it because:<br/><br/>1. Because Godzilla was not center stage. ""ugh incredible, I have to wait to see Godzilla? Gawd what a draagggg.. like in Pacific Rim I didn't have to put up with this, I want my money back!!"". 2. And because of the way he was designed. ""Ugh, that design omg... they put no effort in creating him"".<br/><br/>I for one have to say that I love the fact that Godzilla is not in every-freaking-frame of the movie. The first half of the movie you barely see him and in the second part you have glimpse of him and later on entire scenes with our beloved lizard kicking ass and taking names.<br/><br/>And I really love that! They managed to build up the suspense, making Godzilla look very mysterious and making you say ""oh look, there he is!"" and then poof, he disappears after a building. I had the feeling that I was witnessing those events, like I was right there. This kind of filming should be done more often, I find it a really smart and a more spectacular way of shooting a movie. <br/><br/>Of course, when you compare this way of filming with Pacific Rim (because everybody compare the two) you'd naturally say that yes, Pacific Rim has and advantage over Godzilla. <br/><br/>But in all honesty you cannot compare the two because from my perspective, Pacific Rim is an upfront, here is everything we have to offer kind of movie. It is really generic, you are not surprised by anything. But if you look at Godzilla, oh my... you really have all of the suspense and intrigue that keeps you hooked and makes you want more and more! I think that this movie would have not been as good if Godzilla would have been non-stop from start to finish. It's really refreshing to see a movie like this rather than the generic-action movies like Pacific Rim, Transformers etc. that give you everything on a silver platter and a lot of the times make you say *pfft, boring*.<br/><br/>*Being mean* I think that the people that hate having to wait in order to see Godzilla, are those types of people that have no patience, they are those people that need action, lots of explosions, effects and mindless fighting and a bad script. You have transformers and lots of other such types of movies. If you have half of a brain you would understand this movie.<br/><br/>And concerning the design of Godzilla I think it's great. It looks a lot like the classic lizard but with a couple of tweaks here and there. <br/><br/>I myself was a big fan of the 1998 Godzilla (hey, don't judge... I was 7 years old back then, I didn't know better) and because I hadn't seen any of the old and classic versions of this monster (except from what I saw on cartoon network)I had to compare the 2014 with the 1998 lizard. But I love love love the new version.<br/><br/>Everything about this new Godzilla is great! From design, script and shooting, everything in my opinion is an improvement to an otherwise bland way of making movies like we have nowadays.<br/><br/>So try to have some critical thinking and don't judge this movie because you don't have everything thrown at you from the get-go. Sometimes a little bit of mystery is good and in my opinion they were just building the suspense for the sequel where we will probably have more prim-time lizard action.<br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing the sequel!!!"
"spacemanjupiter","10","40","70","18 October 2014"," Classic Fun
","To all the turds here that think they know what a Godzilla movie should be, and to all the so called 'critics' that couldn't enjoy a movie if they played the star role, this movie isn't supposed to be a Schindler's List or Godfather, and if it had been it WOULD have been garbage. Too bad you couldn't enjoy it because for anyone that grew up actually watching Godzilla like I DID, this movie is nothing but pure greatness and just enjoyable to experience. I'm not going to sit there and nit pick a freakin Godzilla movie for AAA acting and story lines even though I thought both were just fine here. Anyone who has to do that with a Godzilla movie shouldn't be watching ANY Godzilla movies because you have no idea how to appreciate it for what it is and ALWAYS has been.<br/><br/>All I know is this. I haven't been this excited for a movie since Jurassic Park in 1993. When I went to see Jurassic Park everyone in the audience was cheering and standing up to clap for the great parts in that movie. It was exhilarating. I was 18 at that time and felt like I was ten. I had so much fun watching it. This was exactly the same. I'm sitting there, 39 years old and felt like I was ten again. There were great and memorable parts in the movie, and this all adds up to what is called a good movie. Everyone stood up at the great parts and clapped, people were wahooooing, Godzilla couldn't have been more badass looking and animated, and I've watched it multiple times at home again, still yelling and probably waking up my neighbors at the good parts. If that isn't a sign of a good movie I don't know what is, and anyone who is a true Godzilla fan would have noticed some great homages to the original movies.<br/><br/>Another gripe I'll address is the fact that he didn't show up till halfway through the movie, and wasn't stomping throughout the 2 hours. This is what made the movie special, and this is what made Godzilla so special in his role. If they had shown him throughout, people would have been desensitized quickly by his presence, and the movie would have just ended up another CGI fest with no soul. Not to mention some of the old movies were the same way. People would have been ready for the movie to be over with by the end of it, but as it happened, everyone was cheering at the very end wanting more Godzilla, and that's exactly how it should have been. They couldn't have done it any better. And for the people that think it was cheezy for him to ride off into the ocean in the end, GO WATCH A GODZILLA MOVIE and learn a few things. For anyone who is a true fan and grew up with these movies, get the movie and watch it if you haven't already. It's Godzilla at his best."

","In 1998, Roland Emmerich attempted to reignite the eponymous film franchise by creating the critically-panned flop 'Godzilla', 16 years on and we are now faced with one of the best adaptations of the iconic monster's adventures. Gareth Edwards created 'Monsters' in 2010 on a mere budget of £500,000, barely 4 years on and Warner Brothers offered him the chance to create a $160 million adaptation of 'Godzilla'. All the aspects from 'Monsters' are employed in this action/sci-fi adventure, but on a much grander scale. This is a treat for all Godzilla fans and a very respectable adaptation that stays true to the 1950s Japanese classic rather than wandering away like Emmerich's one did. Packed with stunning cinematography, vast special effects and a sweeping spectacle of giant monster battles, 'Godzilla' has been a fantastic start to 2014. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performances are outstanding and there is a certain chemistry that makes their relationship that bit more believable. Whilst at time there are some cheesy and over-the-top scenes, 'Godzilla' is nonetheless an enjoyable action romp that restores the franchise's original glory."

The movie immerses its audience into the adventures of Godzilla which oozes brilliance in every scene it appears. The film is a visual marvel and brilliant in its conception and execution. The movie also explores the oppositional forces other than Godzilla and captures the essence of fear and visual beauty. The movie breathes life into the characterization of Godzilla and enchants itself with every element. The film is an extraordinary testament in its portrayal of the cultural icon of Godzilla. The movie accomplishes the difficult task of genre based film making.The direction of Gareth Edwards is good especially in regards to visuals and creating Godzilla action sequences. <br/><br/>The main and major issue with the film is the very less screen time of Godzilla. This is really a major disappointment, because there is very less Godzilla in the film and Godzilla itself does't get enough screen time in its own film. The Human characters of the film are dull, boring and very underdeveloped. There is no emotional depth and intensity. Another major issue with the film is another major character that is the character of Bryan Cranston, also has a very less screen time. But, its the last superb fifteen minutes of the film that delivers something totally awesome.<br/><br/>(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."

","A truly powerful monster film. Godzilla is an awesome, satisfying blockbuster made by a ""small"" director with a great eye for detail, perspective and performance.<br/><br/>The thread that ties everything in the narrative together starts with Bryan Cranston's (Remarkable performance) nuclear physicist Joe Brody, who escapes the nuclear disaster at the start of the film. His wife (Juliette Binoche) dies in an unbelievably devastating scene and he becomes obsessed in the years afterward because he thinks ""They"" are covering something up. His son (Aaron Taylor Johnson, perfectly serviceable as the human lead) grows up distancing himself from it all, but he's clearly haunted by it. He establishes a family of his own (his wife is played by Elizabeth Olsen, doing a fine job of looking concerned and protective), with a son who misses him dearly when he's away defusing bombs for the military. Anyway, he gets caught up in his dad's pursuit of the conspiracy at the supposed fallout site, and it gets them caught up just as the first MUTO is about to bust loose.<br/><br/>Turns out dad's suspicions were right, and Ford Brody thrusts into the struggle. All he wants to do is get home to his wife and kid, but first coincidence and then duty keep putting him in the monsters' paths. Of course, it all conveniently leads to San Francisco as the military tries to use nukes to lead the MUTOs and Godzilla to the same point offshore, where the human forces intend to nuke them into oblivion. Soon it becomes clear that this is not a good idea — only one nuke detonates offshore at one point, and the forces (led by an appropriately serious David Strathairn) decide to let Godzilla lay the smack down.<br/><br/>And after a mostly patient, masterfully teasing buildup... we get the greatest movie monster battle of all time and it's absolutely brutal and exhilarating. The MUTOs are no pushovers. They give the big guy all he can handle, but Godzilla doesn't mess about.<br/><br/>Don't let all those stories about Godzilla being ""elusive"" bother you, either. There's plenty Godzilla action, plenty iconic images, plenty awesome fighting moves (Atomic ray! EMPs! Swinging tails!). The movie doesn't blow its load early on, though, and it all pays off spectacularly. It's rousing."

","When news got out that we would get a 2014 version of godzilla I was stoked, the trailers looked fantastic and I may have let my excitement get the better of me by raising my expectations.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad but it is not great, the story revolves around such a bland character stuck in a basic disaster movie plot of ""I have to find my family"" blah blah blah you can pretty much guess the rest. This story is dragged on the entire movie and when the big fights between godzilla and the MUTOs are teased.. we get a cut back to the uninteresting story of the bland soldier and his blander wife. The main actors do an alright job with the characters given to them but we see little of the support characters who would be much more interesting.<br/><br/>The big fight at the end is pretty awesome but we see very little of it as again it cuts to the human side, godzilla rather than being the lesser of two evils is turned into just a typical good guy (or monster I don't know) with no reason at all which kind of ruins it.<br/><br/>Over all the movie is pretty mediocre, the cgi is pretty amazing but scenes mostly just consist of dark shadows in smoke. Supporting characters steal the show but we see little of them, the main story is so boring and cliché at times the main fight becomes trying to stay awake rather than godzilla and mutos. I hate to say it but this movie is a let down, badly paced and dull but with one great godzilla fight at the end that is over far too soon."
"sdharper","2","112","217","16 May 2014"," I want to save you from this film....
","I am a big fan of this type of film, monsters fighting, big action sequences but wow did this film disappoint. I always take these movies for what there are and in the end they have to be fun if nothing else. Pacific Rim is a great example of how these films should be made, we know the acting and story is going to be weightless but action and comedy make it fun to watch.<br/><br/>Godzilla has taken the very popular of recent trend of being dark or ""gritty"" as people like to call it but that really struggles to work in a a film that is fundamentally about a giant lizard. The story line is one of the worse ever conceived with no explanation of any of the random things going on. Where have the MUTO's come from and what is there actual purpose? Does Godzilla just sit at the bottom of the ocean until humanity is at threat?<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is a great actor no doubt and for his very brief stint in the film he does his best to add some suspense. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who i like in Kick Ass) is a cardboard actor who isn't really given the script be anything else. Some of the lines in this film feel like a 3 year old has been let loose with a pencil.<br/><br/>The action (or lack of) is average. The fights between the monsters were not well choreographed, they were too slow and the camera was to far out. Godzilla is on screen for about 8 minutes of total and only 2 of them are him fighting. Hes more like the Michelin man that a sleek moving monster. He moves like an action figure with its joints glued. Maybe it would have been better for him to die at the end at least that way there can be no sequel!! <br/><br/>Lots of reviewers gave this film 8-10 stars and i'm starting to believe we may not have watched the same film, I went to see this film on those reviews and wanted to bring some balance. <br/><br/>On another note....the trailer for this film is completely misleading, Hollywood needs to take a long hard look at itself.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Bad acting, worse story and serious lack of action or fun. Avoid like the plague although if i had the choice between the two id flip a coin!!"
"Theo Robertson","7","15","23","14 April 2015"," Satisfying Summer Blockbuster
","I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky's NOAH . I didn't fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you've a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expected <br/><br/>The original GODZILLA from 1954 was of a course a Japanese film that used the monster as a metaphor for the bomb . It did quickly abandon this subtext and just became a long running franchise where the titular monster got involved in all sorts of battles with other giant monsters . In its favour Gareth Edwards version of GODZILLA does keep the ethos of this . Radiation is very much to the fore of the story and while Godzilla might not be the hero he's certainly not the villain and this is reserved for ""Massive Unidentified Terreistial Organism"" a sort of hybrid between a giant praying mantis and a dragon . You know at one point they're going to be meeting in a climatic battle <br/><br/>Of course two hours of giant CGI creatures getting in to a punch up isn't going to resonate with an audience so Edwards includes a very human backdrop as the story takes place through the eyes of serviceman Ford Brody . You got to love that name , it's sounds like a character John Wayne was born to play , a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do , get off your horse and drink your milk etc . It wasn't until I found out after seeing the film that I found out Brody is played by English actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson who I was totally convinced was one hundred per cent Uncle Sam . That said this isn't an actors type of film and I'm speculating that the casting of Cranston and Binoche might have led to the backlash by many people . If you want to see Binoche try not to be blink because you will literally miss her . It's also difficult not to notice that there's a strong streak of manipulation as to how the characters play out . It's also yet another film where a little kid is used in a scene to keep the audiences emotions on tenterhooks<br/><br/>Regardless of this people watch a film like GODZILLA for action set pieces and you can't really fault Edwards for what he's done here . He doesn't have a idiosyncratic quirk to his directorial style and the film does have that kind of Summer blockbuster look but he also previously directed MONSTERS and that movie featured a couple of aliens mating and here the MUTOs have a similar though much more shorter sequence . If you need a film calling for alien reproduction I can see Gareth Edwards being a natural auteur"
"lumzan","10","36","63","15 May 2014"," A very well acted and directed monster mayhem movie with a realistic and humanistic approach.
","I went into this movie with a lot of expectation. I was always a Godzilla fan and I even liked Roland Emmerich's 1998 version. I was a kid back then but as I grew up, i realised how terrible that movie was. This version however did not disappoint at all. It was epic and awesome in every level. I was relieved to see that it was not a typical mindless 2+ hours monster bashing, city destructing movie. Yes, Pacific rim I am looking at you. It was a more realistic and humanistic approach if monsters of that scale really came to life.<br/><br/>**SPOILER ALERT**<br/><br/>Yes, Heisenberg (Bryan Cranston) has delivered once again with his emotional and spirited acting. My only gripe in this movie that he had very little part as he dies very early in the movie. But whatever screen time he had, he made the most out of it. Casting him was a brilliant idea for this short role. Not only did he manage to bring in viewers with his Breaking Bad reputation, he gave an excellent performance with this short but significant role. Ken Watanabe did a fabulous job as well playing the research scientist. Some people complained about Aaron Taylor's part being very one dimensional and lacking punch. I think he did an acceptable job of what was required off him.<br/><br/>The cinematography, CGI animation, the monster fight scenes were truly breathtaking. The build up and the elusiveness of the monsters adds to the suspense and when Mr. Godzilla finally roars into the screen, the audiences are left with a jaw dropping experience. Gareth Edward's direction was brilliant in every sense of the word. The tone of the movie was serious. There wasn't any silly character or lame dialogues to make audience laugh. There was no evil government official cliché or over the board heroic feat of any kind. <br/><br/>Lastly, Godzilla being both the monster and saviour was nicely handled by the story. The final monster clash was truly out of this world. You have to see it in the big screen to experience its full glory. If you expect this to be one of those generic monster bashing, bang bang boom boom high octane movies, then you will be disappointed. This is a realistic portrayal of an unrealistic situation."
"stevenwhitehead3","9","87","166","16 May 2014"," When HE appears....
","Went to an early screening on its release today (May 16th). I was anticipating a ""teasing"" glimpse of the main star of this movie...and it is delivered VERY VERY well..... A Salute goes to films such as Jurassic Park and even Jaws. Jurassic Park gave us the big show and then Jaws gave us the almost no show until near the end. And this film is JUST a nice mix of the 2 aforementioned. The Monsters are not really ""visible"" until a good third of the way into the film. Instead we are greeted by 1950's credits of nuclear holocausts, and mans mistakes with weapons of mass destruction against what is the Alpha Predator of the planet.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston, adds incredible acting to this film, drawing you into his character almost immediately. The wrenching start to the film and the disaster at the Japanese power plant is only the beginning of what is to come. <br/><br/>Earthquakes and ""signals"" draw us closer to what then is the reason we all came to watch this movie. <br/><br/>The MUTO's, which appear, are truly brilliant and hit the screen with a scary realism. but...when HE appears...that is when it gets really interesting! When he appears on screen, in full glory - ALL the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. And his roar!!! WOW!!<br/><br/>Just like the T-Rex scene in Jurassic Park...the big show!! The Big Roar... it hits you all at once and from there, it does not let go. The Military are pretty much useless against them, as the MUTO's ""eat"" radiation, use EMP to wipe out all technology- its all left down to the titular character to roll up his sleeves and do the dirty work. <br/><br/>Great acting, incredible special effects and dark tones, ooze from this film. You don't see too much of Godzilla himself, its more the other creatures that we see, but as I said, when HE appears....its just jaw droppingly good. <br/><br/>If you like a film with great acting, dark moody story line and monsters then you're in for a treat. I know monster films are not for everyone - but Jurassic Park rolled in the pennies at the box office (and still is) so let the audience do the talking....<br/><br/>Great film...Its a while before you see ""him"" appear...but its worth the wait!!"

Any time it got to action it would change scene onto a character I couldn't give two shits about. <br/><br/>Also why is it that Godzilla and the MUTO's have the ability to be invisible? how is it that nobody could see these 100ft monsters until they were right in front of them? how comes Godzilla's footsteps don't cause mini earthquakes in the train scene he should have shattered all that glass with him stamping like that. this is 2014 they had enough money CGI is advanced enough.<br/><br/>Godzilla looked freaking awesome the few times we actually got to see it more Godzilla in a film could Godzilla would be nice."

All bad reviews of this film I've seen have been mainly because (spoiler) Bryan's character died early on which wasn't forbade in the trailer.

"moviexclusive","8","79","152","13 May 2014"," Monster movies don't get any more thrilling, or pulse-pounding, or adrenaline-pumping, or jawdropping than this epic display of size and ferocity
","We don't blame the Japanese for their ambivalence towards another Hollywood rendition of 'Godzilla'; after all, Roland Emmerich did a pretty bad botched job back in 1998, treating the monster as just another creature bent on devastation and missing the point entirely why it is such an enduring icon in pop culture. And so even as some begin to diss this latest attempt at reviving the franchise by criticising it for having gotten 'fat', we don't blame the initial cynicism, especially since Hollywood already has its 'Jurassic Park', 'Cloverfield' and even last summer's 'Pacific Rim'.<br/><br/>Uncharacteristically, the person at the helm of this $150-million production is a certain Gareth Edwards, a Nuneaton boy who has only had one other feature-length film to his name - the micro-budgeted 'Monsters'. It's a daring choice to say the least, but also one that ultimately proves inspired. Edwards eschews the elements of a conventional Hollywood crowdpleaser for something more grounded in myth and pathos, charting a smart middle ground that respects the origins of the creature from its atomic age roots while being entirely in tandem with the modern zeitgeist.<br/><br/>In filmic terms, Edwards tries to honour the character B-movie conceit while delivering a Dark Knight-esque blockbuster steeped in family tragedy, government cover-ups and Post-War on Terrorism sensibilities. So for the first hour, he presents eerie stock footage of Pacific nuclear tests in a title sequence, a nailbiting opening set in 1999 at a Fukushima-style power plant, and then a touching story of estrangement in present day between a father and son pair (Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson respectively) that results from the disaster at the said nuclear station.<br/><br/>Besides Cranston and Johnson, Edwards has also assembled a formidable group of actors to handle the dramatic weightlifting. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of scientists working with a secret research group that has been studying Godzilla since the 1950s, while David Strathairn is the Admiral coordinating the United States' response to the emergence of the creature. But mostly, screenwriter Max Borenstein emphasises the displacement - and reconciliation - between Cranston's nuclear plant engineer and Johnson's explosive ordinance disposal jockey in the U.S. Navy after the death of the former's wife and the latter's mother (played by Oscar winner Juliette Binoche).<br/><br/>On the creature front, Edwards and Borenstein slowly unveil an alpha- predator referred to as MUTO — or ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" - which in Godzilla lore is really a mechanised version of the Mothra. Those who expect a humans-versus-Godzilla showdown the way Emmerich's version had played it out will be quite surprised at the turn of events here, and we're keeping mum here so we don't spoil the surprise for anyone. What we will say is that Edwards really knows how to play things out, baiting and tantalising his audience as he teases the creatures slowly and with increasing attention to detail.<br/><br/>Admittedly, that does take a while before we get the chance to see Godzilla - or for that matter, the MUTOs - in their full majesty, but the wait is more than worth it. Indeed, Edwards reins in the destruction till right at the end, so be prepared for cutaways at certain critical scenes (especially one in Honolulu where a monster-versus-monster showdown takes place offscreen) which may be pretty frustrating for the less patient viewer; but let us reassure you that you won't be disappointed by the epic finale that totally annihilates downtown San Francisco on a scale rarely witnessed. It is here that we get to witness the beast's display of bulk and power, and Edwards nails the sheer thrill of watching these monsters rip through buildings with their sheer size and physicality that turns the Bay Area into rubble.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is also during the last hour of spectacle that we realise more clearly the shortcomings of Edwards' film. Try though he may, there's no denying that the character beats grind to a halt once the action takes over, what dramatic momentum the movie had earlier reduced to a simple rescue mission whereby Johnson tries desperately to get to his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and child trapped somewhere within the city. You could even go so far as to say that the B-movie clichés emerge all too clearly as soon as the monster is in play, with the scientist (Watanabe) at odds with military brass and the latter proving once again their hubris by thinking that their might is greater than that of nature. At once, it is also apparent that Edwards does not quite manage to conceive the 'Dark Knight' of monster movies, settling instead for nothing more - or less - than a well-made engaging creature feature.<br/><br/>So no matter how Edwards or his actors tries to spin it, there's no denying that it is the monster action that counts at the very end. As the human characters get reduced to moving from location to location chasing the beasts, 'Godzilla' rightly becomes the monster blockbuster that summer-going movie viewers will love. The creature effects are terrific, even more so than in 'Pacific Rim' if you must know, and the 'kaiju action' is certainly where it delivers by the motherload. We dare to say even that it will not disappoint fans of Ishiro Honda's 1954 Toho release, nor fans who have grown up with the evolution of the beast in pop culture over the past six decades. It may not accomplish its ambition of being the character-driven feature it aspires to be, but as a sock-em-up monster movie, this one is certainly worthy of the creature's title 'King of all Monsters'."

If you go in expecting an absolutely flawless version of either of those two movies, you might be disappointed.<br/><br/>It starts out a bit slow, and some of the characters are a little flat. None of the leads are flat. Bryan Cranston's acting in particular is fantastic. That's the only negative thing I can say about this movie. The monsters? The visual effects? The story? Spot on. The rest of the movie was incredible, and I can only wish I could experience what it was like to see it for the first time again. I considered giving it a 9 just because the acting wasn't always perfect, but I came away so exhilarated that anything less than a 10 didn't feel right.<br/><br/>I do get the feeling that a couple of the cynical reviews seen so far are from people who have no idea who Godzilla is. For example, one complains about Godzilla not having fire breath, but Godzilla has never had fire breath (it's nuclear).<br/><br/>I feel that moviegoers who are completely unfamiliar with Godzilla might not enjoy this movie as much as those of us who've seen at least the 50's classic, ""Gojira.""

The movie has a good plot that does take some time to absorb after wards because everything moves so fast during the movie...however it is really cleverly done and leaves the door open for sequels. Lots of room for Blu Ray deleted scenes! The movie starts out slow and builds until the end. People clapped and cheered 2x during the movie.

"alanclarke714","9","27","47","16 May 2014"," An Epic Re-Imagining That Sadly Falls Short with the Human Drama
","Godzilla, directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Max Borenstein, is the epic re-imagining of the King of the Monsters. When the Janjira Power Plant in Japan is destroyed, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) believes that ""something"" caused it, and that it wasn't a meltdown. But his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) thinks his father is crazy, until they return to the plant to find that there are forces greater than themselves at work, and the entire world is at risk.<br/><br/>I really don't understand why some people are hating on this movie, whether it be ""Godzilla wasn't in it long enough"" or ""it was just lame."" The latter isn't even a reason, it's an excuse, and the first reason is just sad. This Godzilla is like the ""Batman Begins"" in a Godzilla franchise. Gareth Edwards' directing was outstanding in every way; there were so many moments where i felt the film was much darker and violent than it needed to be. Sadly, the script didn't live up to Edwards' direction. The Frank Darabont-aided script was good without a doubt, but once the first act is over with and Joe Brody's story arc finished, the human element is almost entirely absent. Bryan Cranston brought an Oscar-worthy performance, and was quickly taken out of the film, which angered a lot of people in the theater I was in (myself included). So, if anyone were to hate on this movie, the only reason i could see is that Bryan Cranston wasn't given enough screen-time; he deserved to be in the film until the end, at least. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was great, but in the second act, he was a static and generic ""everyman"" fighting for his family. But, in the third act, there was much more emotional investment in the character as he strove to follow his father's advice; ""Protect your family, whatever the cost."" Elizabeth Olsen was surprisingly incredible in her role as Ford's wife, who was worrying both about her husband and their son. Ken Wantanabe was fantastic as Dr. Serizawa, a man who wants to learn as much as he can about Godzilla. The visual effects, well, are easily the best to date, and even the cinematography is some of the best I've seen in recent films (tied with the cinematography of Transcendence). Then, the musical score was darkly brooding and haunting in all the right ways. Now i don't understand the people who say the score was ""too loud"" or ""overbearing"" in the film, as the score is supposed to be; even the horns in some of the tracks represented alarms during the really intense action scenes.<br/><br/>Godzilla was and is a truly epic rebirth of the Toho creation, but sadly did not have the emotional investment the first act of the film had. Still, Godzilla lives up to its name and ends with a ground-breaking finale to help alleviate the lack of human drama.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars"
"jdavisjdavis","10","32","57","19 May 2014"," Three Movies in One
","One part disaster movie, one part drama, one part monster movie... Godzilla 2014 was perhaps the perfect mix of all three. Some parts of the movie are a build up. Some parts are emotional. Some parts are pure raw awe inspiring visuals and sounds. Speaking of, be SURE to see this thing in a theater with good audio... and I never say that. As a matter of fact I may have to go all out on my home audio now, because the sounds truly put you in this movie. The roars, the explosions, the everything. It felt real.<br/><br/>I will have to say while I enjoyed the acting (I can see how Bryan Cranston made such waves lately) and the place the director made you look internally while viewing (I found myself analyzing my relationship with my family, my job, my country), my favorite parts were definitely when Godzilla showed up in full view. Wow! It was so well done, and somehow stayed true to the many iterations of Godzilla and the many generations of Godzilla fans. It truly is a hair raising, visceral experience to see Godzilla in such a believable way. I just loved that.<br/><br/>And to the director, I saw your 2010 Monsters and was very impressed. When I heard you were doing Godzilla, I had very high hopes. I thank you and everybody who put you in the driver's seat to make this thing happen. My 7 year old son, another huge Godzilla fan, thanks you too. You did it man, you really did."

"daniel-swinskey","10","30","53","26 May 2014"," seriously 2nd best Godzilla movie ever.
","**Contains Spoilers** <br/><br/>When it came out that there was plans for another Godzilla, I thought ""here we go again, someone somewhere just wants more money"". Then I found out that Edwards was directing the film. I had already seen 'Monsters' with my fiancÃ© and both of us decided that for a movie neither of us heard of before and for a Netflix movie. It was pretty fantastic. So I allowed myself some room for hope. (1998 made me believe I would never see my Godzilla dreams realized). Bit by bit, I kept hearing snippets come out that Edwards was bringing it back, old school style. My levels for hope kept rising. Then the Halo jump trailer came out and I was sold. For me, I know who Godzilla is, I know what he does. I wanted more. <br/><br/>Then the Asia trailer came out, and I was hooked. Everything had a retro feel but darker more original. So I did what any self respecting fan did. I shut myself away from any news about this movie. Then one trip to cost-co gave me an offer I could not refuse. Gojira, the original Gojira sold with the bastardized American version, Godzilla raids again and Godzilla vs Mothra for 12 bucks. I couldn't resist. So for the first time ever, I watched the original Japanese Gojira in all of its amazing glory. The helplessness, the fear, the slow realization of hopelessness. The sacrifice. Everything. It was just perfect. Now onto the movie.<br/><br/>The movie sets up really quickly. It brings it so that Gojira is the actual starting off point. Godzilla dies in Gojira but here is the bigger badder one. Everybody is doing what they can to kill Godzilla. In the first 10 min, they explain what I already knew. Godzilla exists and we just cannot kill him. My first thought was fantastic, we are not wasting any time going over him coming out of the water again. We all know, that is what he does. This about what he does next. <br/><br/>Next introducing the characters, we meet Bryan who in character cannot be there for his son. He is too busy doing his civic duty at a Nuclear Power Plant, He is so busy that he never realizes that it was his birthday. The son is left feeling disappointed goes to school and unknowingly witnesses the death of this Mother. Turns out a MUTO who has a fondness for Nuclear Energy destroyed the plant. 15 years later, the kid who has been put off to the side by his dad, due to the dads conspiracy theories and lost his mother (essentially left alone) has to get his father out of jail for trying to break into the quarantined area of the broke down power plant. The son is a soldier, which explains his actions throughout the rest of the film. Dad convinces son to go on a trip to the quarantined zone where they successfully break in, and witness the birth of a MUTO. All chaos ensues and Dad ultimately dies, before his death, Dad tells son to go be with his son. Something the dad had never been able to do. And thus, I sit there with a man tear in my right eye. Realizing that this is what the story is. A man trying to get home to his son. I can relate to that. I would do that for my son. The helplessness conveyed in Gojira, is showcased here. Give a soldier a directive and he will do his best to achieve it. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Godzilla is down for whatever the MUTO's bring. Godzilla is an Alpha animal that will stop at nothing from being the top dog and for the first time in 50 years, he is presented ""prey"". So he stalks and attacks the MUTO's any chance he can get. <br/><br/>I personally loved the wait. I personally loved the focus on the MUTO's. When they screamed, I felt it deep inside my body. The suspense left me white knuckled, and wanting more. When finally allowed to witness Godzilla in all of his awesome glory, I ate in every scene. When it came to the final battle The son, doing his best to make sure he will be able to see his son again. Godzilla doing his best to make sure he is Alpha and the MUTO's doing their best to ensure their survival. It was amazing. When Godzilla got angry (and he did) you felt it. The minute long roar that felt like an eternity left you exhausted. When Godzillas fins started lighting up like as if the depths of hades fury were about to be unleashed (if only for a second), I let out a whispered ""heck yes"". When Godzilla tail whipped a MUTO, while bringing down a MUTO, I winched. <br/><br/>When the Female MUTO screamed at the sight of her babies being burned alive, you felt her pain. When Godzilla ended her, you felt his anger and you felt even for a second, that even though this is a complete fantasy made up ridiculous story that if you were Godzilla, you would have kept it going, just like he did, breathing radiation breath down her throat way longer than necessary. <br/><br/>I experienced another man tear at the end of the movie. When the son is finally reunited with his own son. That moment was very real to me. The main character went through hell. But he was able to fulfill his mission. He saved his family and 'came home'. <br/><br/>#2 greatest Godzilla movie only behind Gojira. Even 60 years later, you should not expect a greater one. This one never tried to out class the original, it merely did its very best to live up to that standard. And it succeeded in almost every way possible."
"bjhomeboy08","4","92","183","13 September 2014"," A film that had so much potential, but flatlined.
","I followed this film for several months before it's release and my expectations were sky high. What I was hoping for was a fresh new take on the original Godzilla film; a grittier, darker, and far more complex film. What I got instead was a cookie cutter military action film that horrendously segued into a pseudo super hero film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the ending of the film completely ruined it for me. The film blatantly asks the viewer to choose whether or not Godzilla is the hero, when in fact Godzilla is not a hero nor a villain. What Godzilla represents is sheer chaos and destruction; Godzilla is ""a force of nature"" and that's how things should be left off. Unlike the atomic bomb, Godzilla cannot be controlled by man, and the beast operates on it's own terms. Thus this is where the main problem of the film lies. The film teeters between this idea that Godzilla, somehow, is our savior, but for the first 90 minutes of the film the viewers are lead to believe that Godzilla must be stopped at all costs. But this problem mainly stems from the poorly contrived military plot. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my second biggest flaw, which are the human characters. The only redeeming characters to the film are Joe Brody, portrayed by Bryan Cranston, and Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, portrayed by Ken Watanabe. Unfortunately their time on screen are severely lacking and any possible resemblance of character development goes out the window once we are introduced to the dry military portrayal of Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. <br/><br/>Instead of going the military/action route the film would have benefited from taking a more detective/mystery/thriller path, which the trailers so falsely advertised. But back to the subject at hand. The characters, besides the previously mentioned two, are dull and lack any redeeming qualities that the viewer can latch on to, which causes us to simply not care about what is happening to them. The film tries so desperately to establish a tone, but that's all the film does. There are no layers or complexities to the situations that are presented, which go hand in hand with the simplistic and boring characters.<br/><br/>My third gripe about this film is that it struggles to identify itself. Is it a disaster movie? A hero film? A monster movie? A thriller? A horror? A science fiction? Well in case you couldn't figure it out, it tries to blend all of these different genres and more. But you often see that in military action films that strive to be more than what it is. If the filmmakers simply went 100% the monster/action genre route then the film would succeeded in delivering it's message and concept. Instead this film appears to have been bogged down by multiple script revisions and having too many hands at the wheel. <br/><br/>And in regards to the elephant in the room, the film is advertised as Godzilla when it really should have been advertised as ""The People vs Godzilla."" Godzilla is only featured in about 20 mins of this 122 min film. While the human characters, excluding Cranston performances, are featured for a good 60 mins. Try to keep yourself awake during long dialogues between bone-headed military superiors and soldiers not listening to the scientists, a boring and shoe horned love interest and blah blah blah...<br/><br/>Overall the film was over-hyped with expertly crafted trailers and advertisements to lead viewers, like me, to believe that this iteration of Godzilla was going to take this franchise to the next level. Like the name itself, Godzilla is a ""God"" like creature that does not play by mankind's rules, vice-versa, mankind must learn that Godzilla is something that we cannot control and we must adapt to live in his realm of destruction and chaos, essentially hell on earth. Godzilla is not a figure that should be labeled as hero or villain, unless that's the initial purpose. Taking cues from films such as Alien and Jurassic Park would have greatly benefited this film in the long run and would have established not just a franchise but a bonafide contender for many Summers to come."
"ASlothsDesire","4","67","130","18 May 2014"," This movie is a joke
","Well, where do I start. I went to this movie without to much hope, but after seeing the trailer and having seen pacific rim I had the feeling that it had potential to be good. Well, it wasn't. The trailer make it out to be this mystical and realistic movie. Basically the trailer contains every scene worth watching, the rest of the movie is just visual ""lorem ipsum"". Let's not forget how it totally make Bryan Cranston out to be a leading role in the movie. Instead he has about 20 minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>The first beginning of the movie was actually pretty good, but after Bryan Cranston's death the movie turns into a rolling train-wreck. The total lack of plot, character development, realism and good acting doesn't make it anymore interesting. The rest of the characters are so uninteresting that I mostly wanted them to die so I would have a reason to care about them. The worst is possibly the immortal main character, who seem to keep one single facial expression through the entire movie. It doesn't help that his facial expression looks like a mix between Kristen Stewart and Jaden Smith. The absent of realism and focus on any other country isn't helping either. Pacific Rim did that right, it included a lot of nations. It appealed to the audience outside of the states. But in this movie Godzilla doesn't even show his face in Japan. <br/><br/>The movie continuous on with different sets of flaws to the very end. You sit there hoping for some sort of redeeming quality that you can take with you when the movie ends, but there just isn't any. The worst part of the movie must have been in the end where the main character has this ""standoff"" with the female Muto, it was so stupid and unnecessary that it made me cringe. Even my friend who invited me to see this film fell asleep. If they just had invested time into the story and characters this movie could have been really good. Instead they barely give the good actors like Brayan Cranston and Ken Watanabe any playtime and spends more time focusing on this dull main character than Godzilla himself."

","I wasn't sure if I should have gone to see this movie, but then my friends asked me to go and see it with them, so I did. After seeing the movie I thought that paying for seeing this movie was a mistake. I have generally somewhat liked movies like Godzilla, but this one was a bitter disappointment for me. I can't point out a single reason for why I disliked the movie, because there were many things that made the movie unenjoyable. To begin with, I think that the story and plot felt unfinished and unwieldy, with no surprises at all. Another sin for the movie were the paper-thin and indifferent characters, who stayed irksomely distant for the whole two-hour length of the film. In fact, the characters felt so distant and glued-on-top, that I could have watched the entire film without seeing any of them. Finally, the last straw was the way too long and unsurprising ending battle. All in all, this movie was sadly not worth watching in my opinion."

","OK, first review, I never meant to post one, but after this I HAVE TO :-D I liked Cloverfield, Pacific Rim, ... but this is just a total mess. No main characters, not even Godzilla (who is mostly presented from far distance). The script is non-existent. Some Monsters walk from one nuclear facility to the next and break some stuff, that's it. Nothing and no one to care about. You might say ""Hey, it's Godzilla!"" Sorry, no excuse for wasting my time like this. Midclass FX, a step above modern TV Shows, not more. Dumb dialogue. A few (!) decent shots. I mean: 160.000.000 $? Really? What for?

Some of the effects are pretty stunning, and the line between CGI and real life is thread thin.<br/><br/>But story wise, it's a dead 2/10, simply this is nothing that hasn't been done before at least ten times.

There is too much missing from this, too many half stories told, too many short-cuts on fight scenes, terrible ""monster"" fight choreography when you do actually get to see it and you draw an emotional blank when trying to relate to anyone in this movie, because they aren't real characters.<br/><br/>A poor age old story with stereotypical characters, no real twist or anything surprising, predictable outcomes and an impressive CGI performance to help draw a subtle explosive curtain over the lack of depth."

","Godzilla, just cam back from it 2 minutes ago. Please don't read on if you want to watch the movie anyway. May be spoilers will follow in the comment below. It reminded me of John Carter, you get a great thing and spoil it to the point that its so bad, I hated it. I can't give it more than 4.5, 3 of them for Bryan Cranston, 1.5 for non shaky camera. Many things in the movie are waste full, if you are spending millions of dollars please find some critic to tell you the plot holes , obvious ones. 1.The guy's dad died in 1945 in Hiroshima, movie is set up in 2014, so the guy should be at least 69 years old, but the character was no more than 50 years old. 2. Your husband is stuck in a nuclear disaster and you put your phone on silent and watch TV with your kid. 3. biggest cast member dies by falling off a railing. 4. 15 years of science study no input what so ever to the film by scientists. 5. Main lead's wife & kids added nothing to the film, they were just plain boring. 6. You have 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world, and those stupid things stick to a tiny bomb you are planting. 7. Even if all the world stand still, Godzilla will solve your problems, oh wait, no - he will kill some by breaking the bridge just for the kicks. 8. you can ride where ever you want, be the smart ass all the way if you are a US marine. 9. You should move the warhead by train so that it can take hours, then train blows up, somehow those things leave the bomb alone, then you go in with helicopters to pick the bomb, then those things will again follow the bomb, just for the kicks. I can go on and on and on, but I don't want to waste anymore of my time. Please don't go to watch this stupid movie, and rent the 1998, that one is 10000% better than this Cr#$. Elizabeth Olsen puts her son on a bus with a co-worker that is fleeing San Francisco; minutes later, when Godzilla is entering San Francisco Bay, the bus is shown on the Golden Gate Bridge heading INTO San Francisco rather than OUT; the co-worker is no-where to be seen on the bus; a cable falls directly in front of the bus, blocking their attempt to escape; a few seconds later, the cable is gone and the bus is able to escape. Horrible, horrible, horrible film. I simply cannot believe that critics are raving about this movie; the critic for salon.com -- an individual I'd thought was pretty reasonable -- says this film is ""the best action films since Jaws."" and kids are playing cheerfully in the bus watching tanks, missiles being fired on the monsters, and anyway what happened to the Admiral? where is US president? , general population will stand by the glass windows to watch the monsters fight, dog on a leash strapped to the tree will somehow break the leash and ran away from tsunami."
"billygoat1071","9","42","80","16 May 2014"," The Real Deal
","This new version of Godzilla is basically Hollywood's redemption to the iconic creature after the fiasco back in 1998. To completely forget that awful remake, it goes back to the classic design of the monster, takes a more atmospheric tone, and stripping off the worst parts (mostly the bad humor) of the abomination. The achievement here is rather astounding. It's not the typical type of action movie that most of the time shoves the large scale destruction to the audience. It instead prioritizes the tension which becomes a totally breathtaking experience. Though, there are parts of the story that deserve a little more exploration to make it an ultimately compelling blockbuster, but then it's already compelling when it features the terror and the largeness of this awesome monster.<br/><br/>It didn't took that long for it to impress the audience. The first act is already a perfect movie. It focuses on a character with a real grief towards the situation. Even more interesting, there is a sociopolitical theme hidden behind the mission which makes an intriguing piece of commentary. But when it hits to the next act, it somehow abandons it and finally rises to the more bombastic points of the story. What comes afterwards follows a character who has a less interesting plight. The lead character, Ford, may have a pretty basic arc, but it wasn't nearly as compelling as his father's. Maybe if he had a solid one, it might have distracted the disasters going on and that is probably true. This movie is all about the monster, and the human element already lies on their scale and fear. The beginning is just a missed opportunity of something more. Otherwise, it's still an engrossing experience.<br/><br/>The film would have been a straightforward explosive extravaganza, but the direction decided to be much challenging. There is an obvious inspiration to ""Jaws"" and even to another giant monster movie ""Cloverfield"" (when it comes to politics). The film does have action, but displaying them aren't the only key to excite the viewers. In fact, the destruction often goes straight to the aftermath. People might feel that they're missing too much mayhem, but actually they're not. The mysteries actually make the threat much larger. Because it's not about how the cities get wrecked, it's more about acknowledging how absolutely formidable these creatures are. The camera also keeps giving tremendous shots of which compares between the scale of a normal human being to the monster.<br/><br/>The character development can still be complained at some point. Thankfully, the acting is splendid. Aaron Taylor-Johnson ends up being the weakest among. I'm not sure if it's his fault, the character is not well developed, but he could have improved and filled the gaps of the supposedly heroic Ford Brody. In contrast, Bryan Cranston is simply terrific in every single scene he is in that one would wish he could have been the main character of the entire film. The rest of the cast surpassed the script and somewhat elevated their characters.<br/><br/>The message is quite clear, Hollywood has learned their lesson. The rest of the drama may not justify the powerful first act, but the film finally succeeds at portraying the Godzilla everyone deserves. It's just full of love, not only to the original, but also to the genre. Other than the behemoth sized set pieces, the film takes plenty of remarkable inspirations from several creature horror movies, from Spielberg's to Reeves'. Even with all the intriguing politics and gravity, the King of the Monsters still stands as the landmark of the whole film. Godzilla is just amazing for reliving the original spirit of this genre."

The first half of the movie is absolutely perfect with all the destruction that the monster provokes. It leaves to the viewer unforgettable scenes. But the second half is not at all a disappointment. The action sequences are effective and spectacular. Godzilla is truly frightening. Young viewers are advised! The acting is also so nice delivering solid performances and helping the drama. Bryan Cranston may be a standout but Elisabeth Olsen is a scene stealer and a very important role here. With any doubts I had an encounter with one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>But now, after some days I say:<br/><br/>This is a riveting entertaining that will please the moviegoers.

"jadepietro","8","42","81","23 May 2014"," Godzilla, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Hate the Bomb
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>True or False: Godzilla has its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in California. Believe it or not, it's true. The King of Monsters is ultra famous, an icon of epic proportions loved and revered by many. Yes, the big guy is back big time in Gareth Edwards' updated reincarnation of the super beast, aptly titled Godzilla.<br/><br/>There have been many versions of this reptilian wonder, over thirty sequels since the first successful film in 1954. As a child, I watched that original Godzilla movie on my black & white Zenith TV in awe. I remember going to the movie theater with my buddies and seeing him fight the likes of King Kong, Mothra, and Ghidorah back in the early sixties. I enjoyed the rampaging of Tokyo as the creature lumbered his way across the miniature city models, shrieking and wailing as he gracelessly stomped the citizens and architecture of Japan. No, I didn't get the anti-nuclear message then, nor did I even care as a teenager. It was a group event, a monster movie, badly acted and even worse, badly dubbed, where you could root for the monster and take in all the destruction on the big screen. It was totally cool and mindless fun. This new and improved 2014 version is that too and more. (I also saw the most recent American remake by Roland Emmerich in 1998 which was ravaged by the critics and I didn't love that film, but I didn't hate it that much either.)<br/><br/>Godzilla (2014) is a different creature entirely, more refined than crass, a monster with a mission. Even the creature's look and movements are streamlined and adroit. The film also brings in top name stars to add some prestige to the project, trying valiantly to remove the schlock and deliver the shock: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, Elizabeth Olsen, and David Strathairn are here, albeit in minor roles. (There are also many monsters-in- combat scenes, but actually, the most frightening creature in the whole film is Cranston's hideous wig which tends to upstage everyone including the main star of the film. No, not Mr. Cranston, I mean Mr. G. himself! And yes, no doubt, I will be having many restless nights from the recurring nightmares caused by that toupee.) Nevertheless, these actors' presence is felt as the director and the writers weave a more personal story into the mayhem, still paying homage to the creature and its radioactive origins. <br/><br/>Besides Godzilla, this reboot focuses on two human characters who fight the monster and their own personal demons: Aaron Taylor- Johnson is Ford Brody, a soldier with an itchy trigger finger and Ken Watanabe is Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, an earnest scientist who views Godzilla in a savior rather than destroyer. The sub-plot is slim and formulaic, but both actors do a solid job of conveying the film's preachy message about man's foolhardy attempt in controlling nuclear power. Much time, perhaps too much time, is spend on the human back-stories and the interrelationship of the film's non-reptilian characters prior to Godzilla's entrance. (The creature doesn't even surface until an hour into the film.)<br/><br/>Still, as always, it's the action sequences that matter most. These creatures get around as the film globe-trots from China and Hawaii and California and Nevada, specifically Las Vegas (well, they are high-rollers), to where else but that iconic landmark of monster movies, the Golden Gate Bridge, for a climactic smack-down. This Godzilla uses state-of-the-art visuals to keep interest high. (The tsunami sequence is thrilling.) The CGI work is very impressive. However, the 3-D effects scattered throughout the movie don't really amount to much and the MUTO monsters (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), lack real menace or originality and are inspired too closely from Aliens, Starship Troopers, and Transformers. Production values are strong, especially Seamus McGarvey's imaginative cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's dramatic musical score which helps to contribute to the film's success. <br/><br/>As the director, Edwards' unique vision incorporates shadows, aerial perspectives, and clever point of views via masks and goggles to bring some needed tension. He efficiently shoots the film with a minimum of story and a maximum of tightly staged battles, keeping the action at the forefront and making Godzilla (2014) an unexpected guilty pleasure. This film will do serious damage at the box office with, I'm sure, another sequel in the near future. Godzilla lives on! GRADE: B<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com<br/><br/>NOTE: The opening credits are particularly well done, with a montage of 1950's archival footage of nuclear bombings and redacted text highlighting the cast and filmmakers. It helps to set the right tone for a more serious monster film right from the start."

None of the ones I usually had were in the film at all, like the military being completely incompetent or people getting killed by the monster by doing dumb things. It felt very realistic and everything had weight to it. Seeing it in IMAX only helped with this, the depth was fantastic.<br/><br/>Godzilla was faithful to the original monster, and felt respected as Godzilla instead of just a big dumb monster. The designs of the MUTO's did seem a little out of place, but they did look great as well. A few scenes were very striking when they stood in full form, same with Godzilla.<br/><br/>This was the first movie in a very long time to give me chills. I can't stress enough how massive everything felt. I recommend IMAX if possible.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't a fan of the original Godzilla, you can still find things to love in this."

","It's hard to believe It's been 60 years since Godzilla first appeared on the big screen. Now after the awful attempt by Sony Pictures back in 1999 from Roland Emmerich, we final have Godzilla done right. A movie that will help G-Fans relieve their childhood. Director Gareth Edwards and writer Max Borenstein pull out all the stops in this CGI monster romp. Like many have said, the cgi in this film just blows my mind. Godzilla looks great and is a perfect mesh of old and new. Last Years Pacific Rim came close, but Godzilla is the perfect way to spend your time at the movies. Is the story perfect? no, but it hits the right notes and Edwards taking his play book from Spielberg and Jaws teases us just right until the big showdown at the end. Actor Bryan Cranston helps the material shine even more with his appearance at the beginning. I wished he had more screen time, but Ken Watanabe is also there to help out. Not a perfect film, but one filled with action, excitement, thrills and plenty of Godzilla screen time to release the inner kid in anyone. This is a must watch."

","Since it is so new, I don't want to give away any of the really good parts. But I was really, really disappointed in the 1998 remake. It was not true to the original Godzilla legend. The 1998 Godzilla was a coward who ran from the military. This one does it all. This Godzilla Dominates, as Godzilla was meant to do. When Godzilla finally awakens and fills the screen, he lets out an awesome theater wall shaking roar that makes it clear it is ""game on."" I gave this a 10, not because it was a perfect movie. The human interest stuff was not very effective. I gave it a 10 because Godzilla and his monster foes were truly awesome on a grand scale.<br/><br/>I saw it in IMAX 3D, but I am not sure either is necessary (IMAX or 3D). But I think if you wait to see it on DVD or streaming at home, you will definitely miss a lot of the overwhelming spectacle, unless you have a huge screen and professional level theater sound system at home and turn up the volume. But this movie would still be great in 2D at a commercial theater with a decent sound system and large screen.<br/><br/>One comment: disappointed they couldn't use Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" in the movie somewhere. Probably something to do with too much money for the music rights or something, but I do not know. Maybe they just chose not to use it.<br/><br/>Overall: Great Movie. See it in the theater, even 2D would be awesome."
"slayerjmk95","8","31","59","11 May 2014"," The Godzilla Remake No One Saw Coming
","The original Godzilla is a classic, and is still an extremely entertaining movie to this day, but it lacks a certain relevance and heart seen today in other big (and small) movies. So when i heard there was a Godzilla remake happening, i couldn't not think of the disaster that was Roland Emmerich's Godzilla. Then, i saw the previews, and i was blown away. In this re-imagining, Godzilla is a terrifying force of nature that fights to defeat the MUTOs, Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms. But what really makes this Godzilla remake stand out is the ""human element,"" present in the lead human characters portrayed by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Ken Wantanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen and David Strathairn.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think this Godzilla is better than the original, and for multiple reasons. Firstly, Gareth Edward's direction. The movie feels like a Batman Begins-esque version of a Godzilla franchise, where we don't see the titular character for most of the first third of the film, but more and more as the film progresses, and it works extremely well. And the way Edwards grounds the film in reality and with the times is just amazing, and disturbing. The acting is absolutely incredible, and surprisingly enough, it's not Bryan Cranston that steals the show; Taylor-Johnson does it with his ""everyman"" character, Ford Brody. The visual effects were easily the best part of the film, and some of the best visual effects of all time. There wasn't a single moment that had me thinking, ""That's definitely CG there."" I was completely glued to my seat in awe, like most of the other people in the theater and didn't think twice about what I was seeing. Even the musical score by Alexandre Desplat was haunting and epic, with the main theme being extremely memorable (I was humming it on my way out of the theater). The script was great, but there were moments where, they were fantastic and all, but felt like filler-moments; you didn't need them, but they worked.<br/><br/>Godzilla was a superb and epic monster movie that i think is a masterpiece in filmmaking, and could be hailed as a classic further down the line. I agree with some critics in that the marketing campaign was a bit lousy in that they showed off Godzilla a little too much (since he isn't seen constantly throughout the film), but to lower the score of the film because of giant lizard's absence in the first act isn't right; it isn't.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars"

My mouth was wide of awestruck and wonder. It - is - Briljant!<br/><br/>I saw it in IMax 3D in The Hague. I loved the fact that the movie let you wait for the marvelous fight of Godzilla in the demolished city. There were even some winks from the director I guess: there were scenes Godzilla was about to fight, but the shot was in an angle you could almost see it happen, but not quite. And that happened a few times though. But, hey, if it was only a movie about Godzilla fighting some monsters, it would be a short one without a great storyline.

","I had high hopes for this as someone who liked Breaking Bad and the trailers I had seen for this movie. I had thought it was going to be a throw back to the 1950s where Godzilla was actually a monster and people where having a hard time figuring out how to kill it. But it turned out to be another of the kiddie Godzilla saves the world battling other ""evil"" monsters. There were a lot of people in the theater that seemed to enjoy it and cheered whenever the big guy made an appearance. However...<br/><br/>There was an hour of set up before the monster action started. The actor I was hoping to see save the world got killed in a simple fall. The ""hero"" I guess you would call him comes home after a 14 month deployment promises his kid he will be there in the morning but hops the first plane to Japan to bail his Dad out of jail. Aren't there bail bondsmen in Japan? This same kid is stuck on an evacuation bus by his mother because she thinks its better to send the kid off by himself and wait for her husband to come home. The entire US military seems to consist of a few army units with machine guns an a bazooka, the navy of ships that has no guns, and a few tanks that decide to take up defensive positions on the golden gate bridge! The Air Force does actually try to use some technology but are helpless as the monsters give off EMP which knock the plans out of the sky.<br/><br/>One of the ironic parts was that even though the adult monsters are invulnerable a gasoline fire can take care of all their eggs without a problem. And oh my God what a twist when it turns out the nuke may actually go off while it's still in the city.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie where the whole city is being evacuated but when the monsters fight there was still some shots of people working in a high rise office. Those are dedicated workers!! Another big disappointment was the big airdrop with the guys trailing red smoke. Since there was still tons of people in the city including the hero's wife there doesn't seem to have been a reason why they don't just have jogged in. They also try to hide and remain silent when on the ground but for some reason decide to trail the red smoke so everyone including the monsters can see their trajectory. It does look cool on the screen but it really had no purpose.<br/><br/>In addition to killing off Bryan Cranston early in, Ken Watanbe has nothing to do but have a worried look on his face and tell people to let Godzilla handle things. And David Strathairn has much too wimpy of a persona to be the tough Admiral who the US Government has delegated all responsibility to. Aaron Taylor-Johnson had no charisma in this role and it's hard to tell if the writing made him bland or he just is bland. They also had a little subplot of him helping a little boy separated from his parents which did nothing but add to the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>I got the impression that they wanted Sam Shepard for the part of the Admiral and Channing Tatum for the part of the hero and went down the list of that type of actor until they got these two.<br/><br/>The production team also chose to have a lot of shots of buildings that have already been destroyed, cut aways from the monster fights, and many many scenes of reaction shots of people looking on in shock and what is coming. I was hoping to see more of the monsters actually doing these shocking things then just the aftermath and the looks on people's faces.<br/><br/>So if you want to see another Godzilla versus the Smog Monster type of movie you will probably enjoy it. If you want a serious monster then this one isn't for you."
"thedarksteps","7","16","28","16 May 2014"," Too much trite storyline, not enough stomping
","While I like the new design and the fantastic CG, this Godzilla movie is kind of like the Lorax... the name of the movie has little content of the main character; The Lorax was only in ""The Lorax"" for about 8 minutes of the movie, unfortunately that's about all the screen time Big G gets, the rest is uninteresting unpolished plot that makes you wish they would just ""get on with it"" as Monty Python said. Godzilla movies are kind of like porn, nobody watches it for the storyline they watch it for the action, so talk less and pound more.<br/><br/>Also, critics and many reviewers are laying into this movie saying the storyline was bad or that the acting was sub par... it's Godzilla, do you expect Meryl Streep to make a 3 minute cameo and rack up yet another Oscar ? This is a popcorn movie, it's meant to sell tickets and to show the Japanese how to make a movie that doesn't involve someone wearing a $2M suit for some weird on screen cos-play action. You dump a $160M in and hope you make twice that back, who cares if every Big G fan walks out feeling like a comic con fan who doesn't get the autograph he stood in line for.<br/><br/>If there is a sequel to this movie, make it more like Pacific Rim with tons of action and very little story or dialog. I mean really, how much story do you need? 50 story lizard has a beef with mankind and his only means of dealing with his aggression is to stomp the **** out of everything that the minuscule little primates built. 120 minutes of Godzilla goodness, 3 minutes of dialog.

"ezioeagledan","10","34","67","13 May 2014"," Bam! Brilliant monster movie which is sure to give a breath of fresh air to the genre.
","Well, the latest iteration of the 60-year-old franchise is in capable hands. Edwards' ""Godzilla"" is a pleasingly paced 3-D spectacle that pays chilling homage to the artful legacy of the original 1954 film — Ishiro Honda's ""Gojira"" — while emerging as its own prodigious monster movie.<br/><br/>Created as a symbol of the nuclear threat following America's atomic attacks on Japan in World War II, Godzilla's reappearance suggests the nuclear tests conducted by the U.S. in the Pacific after the war were really meant to hold the radioactive dinosaur back.<br/><br/>This story begins in Japan in 1999 as nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston, edgy in an unbearable wig) investigates questionable seismic activity at the Janjira nuclear power plant.<br/><br/>When a team at the plant, including his scientist wife, Sandra (an underused Juliette Binoche), dies in what everyone believes is a natural disaster, Joe dedicates his life to proving that what caused the devastation was anything but natural. His obsession creates a rift between himself and his son, Ford.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, we catch up with Ford (played by a placid but sexy Aaron Taylor-Johnson) in San Francisco, where he lives with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and their son.<br/><br/>Serving in the U.S. Navy, Ford disarms bombs, a skill that later helps him save the planet from MUTOs — ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" — that emerge from a long dormancy and begin traveling the globe, feeding on radiation.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Max Borenstein, working from a story by Dave Callaham, doesn't bombard us with multiple narratives or a multitude of characters (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins play scientists, and David Strathairn plays an admiral).<br/><br/>Instead, the film focuses on Ford's family story, which Borenstein takes his time developing. When we finally see Godzilla — just shy of an hour into the film — the anticipation has built to such a degree that we expect to be awe-struck. And we are.<br/><br/>The tallest of any Godzillas before him, this one stands 355 feet high — about 30 stories — with glistening, scaly skin and dorsal fin spikes down his back. His terrifying yet textured roar shakes the theater.<br/><br/>Aiming for a realistic take on how we might react to an invasion by giant creatures, Edwards makes sure our view of them rarely shifts from the human perspective.<br/><br/>Honoring the eerie music of the original, this film's score by Alexandre Desplat (""Argo"") is equally menacing, rich with horns that complement the consistently serious tone of the movie.<br/><br/>But we're not bombarded with excessive CGI here. Godzilla isn't oversold, although for some, his lack of screen time won't be satisfying enough. However, the balance between the family-focused story line and intense action sequences is bound to please others.<br/><br/>A threat to the planet in the '50s version, Godzilla isn't out to take the world down this time. He's here to be its hero and his massive showdown — fiery radioactive breath and all — against the MUTOs is the highlight. He's more than a catastrophic beast and we're on his side when he swims off into the sunset.<br/><br/>While the predictable sequel has not yet been confirmed, one thing is clear: Edwards' version of ""Godzilla"" remains the ultimate monster movie. The legacy has been upheld."

"tarnishedsoull","1","42","85","19 June 2014"," I like Swiss cheese on my sandwiches, not the plots of my movies.
","OK. I pretty much made this entire account because of how disappointing this movie was, because I was pretty excited to see this iconic beast brought to life. Anyone who thinks this movie was good, is suffering from a serious case of nostalgia ""I wish it was like it was back in those days"" syndrome. Yeah, movies have progressed(just like everything else)and you just expect better than the terrible, terrible vacuum this movie leaves in storyline telling. (And keep in mind this movie tried very hard to be realistic).<br/><br/>Starting from the beginning: Scientist dude/meth dealer is told his son spent time making him his ""sign""-which was for his birthday. Says it'll be OK. Within the same scene-acts surprised that its his bloody birthday(and not in a joking way).<br/><br/>First muto ""nest"" finding-its explained that the creatures(which a 5 year old obviously came up with)are ""parasites"" that ""killed"" another prehistoric creature(possibly a cousin of Godzilla which would explain why he's so p-id). Yet for the rest of the movie, they act as sexually reproducing, radiation eating, giant f insects.<br/><br/>Dog on island is shown to be tied to tree barking-next scene is happily running away from giant monster insect/arachnoid whatever the f. <br/><br/>It is also explained that Godzilla is ""Hunting"" these insects. Uhhh...to what end? He eats radiation I thought...Then he does finally get his snack-killing 1st insect, but instead of gorging himself silly like any natural predator would following a long-a chase and fight-he completely ignores it. Then kills the 2nd one and ignores that too. Then comes back to life and happily ignores all the little bipeds that have been shooting at him to go back into the sea-still not having eaten. I wonder if his poop glows radioactive....<br/><br/>U.S. military is portrayed to be mentally challenged: firing from a rooftop with civilians drawing attention to civvies, moving giant nuclear missiles over land instead of firing an Icbm(wouldn't let me do caps?)into the Pacific Ocean, running billion dollar jets(repeatedly)into creatures known to emit Emps, never using the big guns and missiles from the distance they are supposed to be used at, missing a giant f creature breaking out the back of a nuclear repository site(which somehow missed that same giant creature gestating in there for god knows how long), lining up tanks on the Golden Gate Bridge, and employing that main actor dude(who mainly sucks just on the fact that he is a terrible actor).<br/><br/>Acting-well what acting. All of the characters and their interactions were one dimensional(cliché scenes with absolutely no build up, relationships completely unemotional and not engaging)-in fact I kept hoping all of the main characters would die, they were that annoying. Honestly if all the characters had died, making some sort of epic ""sacrifice"" it would've made for somewhat of an emotional movie-if only for the satisfaction of seeing annoying, bad characters come to a sticky end-preferably in the atomic mouth of a giant lizard. Even that Japanese dude(who is generally a pretty good actor)was stuck with a canned character with canned lines and looked like he had a major case of tuna constipation.<br/><br/>When the action scenes came around-they started with wide lens on monster, start of fight between monsters-end. There was like 3 fights in there-and you got to see maybe a tenth of what ""happened"". Obviously done to save money on those costly CGI sections. Godzilla was a 2ndary character with about 20 min of footage in his own movie...if I was him I'd get better agents.<br/><br/>This sucked so bad I felt the need to write the first movie review I have ever written in my life. I have just spent 20 min of my life writing this down. Wow this movie sucked. And now you know that I know that it sucked. I had to re-edit this 5 times due to ""prohibited words"". ffs."

","Very fun experience. I loved Godzilla as a kid. I wanted a Godzilla movie I could appreciate today and this delivered in all aspects. I thought the movie was excellent considering the balancing act needed to pull this off right. Pleasing the masses with the spectacle and delivering a movie with emotional content, a gritty dark tone, ending in a big pay off to leave you wanting more. Cranston brings the most emotional content by far. The rest of the cast do well with what they were given, but I feel Cranston should have been more pivotal, and the movie's lead throughout. There are some truly unforgettable scenes in the film. The plot is as compelling as you'll get with a big summer blockbuster and even more so. There's story there, heart, etc. Nothing is mindless. If you can watch this with an open sense of imagination you will really enjoy it. Imagine this shizzy really went down! I promise you'll enjoy the slow build up and terror type thing they go for a lot more. Around every corner turn, or look up, destruction, etc. See this film to have a good time and indulge in the story, scenario, experience, etc. I appreciate the Alien/Jaws type build up and Love or hate this movie, Godzilla looks amazing, and the final act is fantastic! It was worth the teasing of the imagination and anticipation. There are unbelievable shots and that final act might be the bes set piece of the summer. Many scenes I found well done. The effects were second to none. There was a primal fear/scary atmospheric..dark..gritty tone. It worked wonderfully. This was the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen and I've seen them all. The effects of the disaster, the tsunami, the plant meltdown, are relevant to our times. I appreciated the big scope they went for in the film. Man toys with nature and when nature strikes man has nothing they can do about it. Or even the fact the US has all these things and are the world authority over them. I won't spoil too much but there is a reason for Godzilla etc to be where they are when they are. Overall the experience (which is a huge factor for a summer blockbuster type of movie) delivered on all angles. IMAX 3D is outstanding. It really is a fun fun time. I will be seeing it again and cannot wait till there is DVD release bc yiou knowwww Edwards had to leave out a lot of stuff he wishes he could have left in the theatrical. That might be a lot of the stuff some critics are saying were missing. I bet that's the case. I don't understand a lot of the bad reviews. This was not an easy project. I enjoyed Pacific Rim, and Cloverfield, but this blows them out of the water IMO."
"t-viktor212","8","9","14","21 December 2014"," Not as bad as other users say
","I am costricted by other users' too low rating to give this a 10/10 to attempt balancing the rating.<br/><br/>Now, this is not a movie that is mainly about two hours of godzilla walking around a city and smashing all. We have that too, but in a brief way, making it not the main part of the film.<br/><br/>The film's first part is a slower, more thriller-like part, with some clear references to Tarkoskij's ""stalker"" that I've personally spotted, but that still drives some plot in it. The second part of the movie is the one that includes the most action and catastrophic-apoc. scenes, and I'd like to underline the use of a track composed by Gyorgy Ligeti, used also in 2001: a space odissey to give the right atmosphere to a scene that I'd define iconic to this movie.<br/><br/>Complains about this movie come from the real pro of the movie, the existence of a not- too plain plot, and the short amount of screen time Godzilla has, choice done by Edwards maybe because this is somehow just an ""introduction"" movie, all reasons that make this a ""not-just-action"" movie, and reasons I actually liked it. Also the subplot of the characters involved gives a more real-like feature to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, as I said I wouldn't truly rate this 10/10, but more a 8/10, because it still doesn't have a so-complex plot, but I wouldn't blame writers or the director for that, they already tried to do the most possible, but more likely the carachter itself's plainess... let's admit, Godzilla couldn't have a very complicated plot anyhow.<br/><br/>Still I liked this movie and suggest everyone to see it."

"Tehmeh","7","31","61","19 May 2014"," Just got back from the theater.
","Well, well. I'll say this first: I haven't seen the Japanese original nor the sequels. I've only seen the horrible abomination from 1998. This one is naturally better, but I want you (the reader) to know that I'm not familiar with everything Godzilla.<br/><br/>Monster movies seem to have a pattern. There is always a family, some military involvement and the works. ""Godzilla"" is not an exception. What is exceptional though, is the way these things were handled. Yes, sometimes I cringed at some family matters, but other times (especially when Cranston was on screen) I was almost moved.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston naturally does fine, but Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the lead. He is the character that is everywhere at almost all times. He's sometimes more of a plot vehicle than a character, and this movie isn't surely worth watching because of him, but at least he didn't annoy me as much as I feared and the movie managed to get to the point I was waiting for without making me hate the wait. Ken Watanabe, too, is handled mainly as an exposition machine or is tasked with setting up the mood, but he's always enjoyable to watch and when he's on screen everything feels a lot better.<br/><br/>The monsters, what they are and what they do, are set up well enough. We get some impressive visuals and decent build-up even before the first full-on action scene. The creatures are introduced nicely, and when they get to business, it's all nice to watch.<br/><br/>Godzilla is of course the main character, and many people complain that he isn't shown much in this film. That is not a moot criticism, and I understand that. However I enjoyed our hero of a monster more this way. When he WAS on screen, it was more special and worth the wait.<br/><br/>While this is (at least on the human side) a fairly serious movie, I found something uplifting in the monster action itself. Little boy inside this grown man cheered, and even though a lot of buildings and property got smashed, I didn't get tired or annoyed about it like in, say, Man of Steel. There is childish excitement to be found in this movie, even though you'd have to wait for it some time.<br/><br/>My only criticisms are these: the tired family/military-portion of the monster movie formula (while not nearly as bad as I feared), and sometimes the pounding score didn't know when to stop and let our ears take a breather. Because when it did stop in the middle of chaos, the silence was eerily beautiful. I wish we would've had more of that important contrast.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this as a theater experience, not sure if I'll eventually buy the blu-ray because I don't feel like seeing this again. Anyway, some gripes aside, ""Godzilla"" provides a fun movie experience and washes away some of the bad taste you got in your mouth (brain) from the 1998 version."

","(Unless you're one of those fans that couldn't get over the design of Godzilla's feet, then clearly you decided a long time ago that this would ruin your whole experience.)<br/><br/>I can safely say that I've awaited a godzilla film of this caliber for twenty years, since I first discovered the original film at the age of 5. In my humble opinion Garreth Edwards has done justice that hasn't been done to Godzilla in quite a while now, you can tell he became so close with the character he was able to give him a personality, little mannerisms that one catches while watching the film. Even giving the MUTOs moments that made me feel a little bad for them. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston gave an amazing performance that nearly brought me to tears on more than one occasion, and Ken Watanabe was amazing as always. I didn't much care for Aaron Taylor Johnson, as kind of a blank slate perhaps he was meant for us to take his place in all of it. But what really stood out to me was Elizabeth Olsen's participation in the final battle in San Francisco, she was the eyes and ears for the audience and added a much needed human element to the giant monster fight going on all around her. <br/><br/>The special effects were beautiful, I love the new Godzilla design and the MUTOs were both creepy and a little beautiful in their own ways as well. As a giant monster movie there won't be much Oscar buzz no matter how good the effects or acting and that makes me a little sad, Edwards certainly deserves more credit than he'll most likely get for pulling this off as well as he did. I'll say gladly now that from here on he'll have my support in any future endeavors. I would really like to shake his hand for his magnificent interpretation of the King of the Monsters, the avatar of nature's wrath and balance, and an old friend back on the big screen at least one more time."

The movie is full of inconsistencies, like the authors invested all their powers to make something that will insult intelligence of an even below average intelligence watcher. The acting was horrible, I think nobody understood why is the main character important for the story and what impact he makes. My friend pick this movie and I think this is the last movie that he will choose when we go together to the theater :). He slept more then a half of it.

"patricklshan","7","18","33","7 October 2014"," Not the best Godzilla movie but still decent
","I really like this Godzilla movie. Granted it's not as good as the original 1954 version, Mothra vs Godzilla, the Heisei era flicks, or GMK but it's still good. The effects were amazing with everything conveying a strong sense of scale as all the monsters move slowly like larger than life forces. Also they made Godzilla a nigh- indestructible force of nature with his signature durability and atomic breath. Surprisingly the kaiju have lots of personality expressing moments of joy, love, despair, weariness, and wrath. In fact, I'm willing to look past the dull look of the MUTOs because they act like real animals and show so much emotion.<br/><br/>Yet as much as I enjoy the movie, there is the main downside everyone brings up: Godzilla doesn't show up enough. Granted there are lots of creature features that focus more on the humans like Jurassic Park, Aliens, Predator, and Jaws. However, those movies at least had characters that while neither the deepest or most complex, were at least likable and recognizable. <br/><br/>Here the main human characters are generic and lifeless. Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance as Ford is boring and lacks the stoic intensity of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood. They could've made Ford have an angry grudge against Godzilla and the MUTOs that would clash with Sherizawa's respect for Godzilla. Ditto Elizabeth Olsen's Elle,she never seemed to show emotionally heartache or depressed concern for her patients or her family. Their bland characters would've had been so annoying had they not overshadowed Bryan Cranston's Joe and Ken Watanabe's Sherizawa.<br/><br/>If the creators are going to make another Godzilla flick, then they should either increase Godzilla's screen time or at the very least bring in better actors and create more memorable characters. That said,it's still a fun movie on its own merits and I'm looking forward to the sequel"

","To all the people who complain there wasn't enough Godzilla in this movie: Have you ever seen the original Gojira (1954)? Or ever heard of a thing called 'tension-building'? Surely not.<br/><br/>This film was everything I hoped it would be and then some! The characters were all great, there isn't a single bad performance - everyone treats this with respect and add an appropriately serious tone to the film. Ford Brody is my favorite as his strict code of Honor and morals was put to the test by malevolent creatures, which created some brilliant dilemmas and great duo scenes with his father (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston). Themes were perfectly adapted from the original Gojira, which makes this 10x more dark and gritty!"
"gumby_0000","1","30","60","21 May 2014"," How many times can you say muto in 2 minutes
","OK I saw the film today in the theatre and contemplated actually leaving the theatre. There is an almost endless list of reasons why which I will go through for you all 1) acting was God awful, not to sound like a breaking bad fan boy but Brians role was the only one with emotional ties... The goofy army kid who forgets about his mom instantly... His arm candy submissive wife who blindly agrees with everything he says... The kid who does nothing... And the Japanese scientist who's only job it is to look shocked throughout the whole movie and say almost next to nothing... Even though he's supposed to be the Godzilla genius do absolutely nothing. 2) the story shockingly has very little actual monster action in it... Which normally I wouldn't care as long as the story was in depth... But it wasn't... The love and survival story if elaborated upon amidst disaster I. E. Titanic could be box office gold but it's muddled up with all this useless military hijinks, maybe if they managed to kill one of the monsters or if army kid was able to defuse the bomb in the nick of time it would have justified all the countless minutes of screen time wasted on army stuff. 3)the continuity errors are staggering... If you spot them easily you will constantly be shaking your head at this film... I mean they had to go through all the bunkers in nevada to find the 1 that just so happened to take out half the mountain, the helicopter didn't notice that or the fact that a 50 story bug was walking away from the mountain, in broad daylight, in the desert, or the fact army guy needed binoculars to see it. Or my favourite continuity error... When they said that the monsters require radiation to spawn more... Right before the mountain monster breaks free from the largest deposit of nuclear radioactive waste in the world... To chase a single bomb on a train... Or he could have stayed at yucca flats and had 10000000 years worth of radiation... Worst movie I've seen in a long time"
"sezwho321","1","33","67","20 July 2014"," The movie is a teaser until the last 20 minutes
","This was a colossal disappointment. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting to see a good movie when I went into Godzilla. I was expecting a Michael Bay style movie: loud noises, explosions, awesome effects, and not too heavy on the plot. I was looking for basic, cheap, and entertaining. I got none of that. Not only does the movie contain horrible acting from all but the most minor characters, critical plot holes, and teases the audience by threatening to show us what we came to see, but when it finally delivers what we wanted all along (a good classic monster fight), its horrifically underwhelming and poorly done. My biggest problems with the movie are that it cuts away right when it starts to show something that might relieve us from the tedium of bad characters, a weak script, and bad plot. This is slightly a spoiler but not really, but the first two times that two monsters actually engage in combat, the scene cuts away immediately and we never see it again. It skips what we actually want to see. It's the equivalent of watching porn but skipping all the parts that don't have clothes on. That kind of stuff belongs in the teasers and the advertisements so you can get people to come watch the movie, pay for it, and then they get to see the rest. Instead, after you've spent money, you still get teased and toyed with like you have to buy the super premium to see the good stuff. This movie just plain sucks. I talked about how it lacks general monster mayhem, so you would hope it at least makes up for it with an interesting plot, topics, references, etc. Nope. Throughout all of the perilous situations, there was not a single moment where I actually cared whether characters lived or died. They simply weren't engaging and nothing they did mattered. All in all, there's nothing here worth seeing. It's a monster movie that shows minimal monsters, minimal cool things in general, and maximum tedium and boredom. It lacks the qualities of a good movie, and it doesn't then make up for it with the noise and explosions of a summer flick. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch Pacific Rim again so I can remember what its like to see a movie that shows what it tells audiences it's going to show, namely monsters fighting."

"NBates1","2","4","5","10 January 2016"," Quite disappointing
","This movie's title is misleading, because Godzilla basically makes a cameo only. The movie drags and drags and just when things start to get interesting (action sequences, fight scenes), it cuts back to the boring human story-line. Also, the awesome Bryan Cranston is killed not too long into the movie. He was definitely the best actor and most interesting human character, but, of course, the hero is his boring son, who is not that great of a character essentially. Godzilla looks awesome, and spews this great powerful energy but doesn't use it much, and a long time is spent just watching him swim towards and away from the town, with the military following him. Honestly, the MUTOs have a lot more screen time than Godzilla, who this movie is supposed to be about. A lot of time is spent in the dark, frustrating the audience even more and making the film even longer. There was of course the cliché of the wife and kid in trouble, who are characters not worth caring about. Godzilla ends up the savior of the town, which is okay. The film is visually stunning, so there's a plus. This should not have been called Godzilla, it should have been another creature to save the day, because the MUTOs are basically the main monsters here. All in all, a visually stunning movie that was extremely disappointing."
"Leofwine_draca","5","4","5","23 August 2015"," Mixed feelings, inevitably
","When I heard that the American studios were producing a new GODZILLA movie, I had mixed feelings about it. Their previous GODZILLA film, made in 1998, was absolutely execrable. The director of this new version was Gareth Edwards, who previously made the low budget MONSTERS, which I wasn't too keen on. And as a massive fan of the various Japanese film series, how could the Americans possibly hope to do the subject justice? The answer is that they don't, at least not really. Only in the last half an hour of the film does this become a GODZILLA film properly; until that point, it feels more like MONSTERS 2. Edwards obviously has a passion for huge-sized beasties, but as a film-maker he leaves me cold. Much of the running time here consists of following around an absolutely dull, one-dimensional American family who have little to do with the actual big events of the film.<br/><br/>Thus we get Bryan Cranston grieving his wife, Elizabeth Olsen randomly working in a hospital, and an annoying kid lurking around. The worst of the lot is the erstwhile lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (KICK ASS) who gives the singularly most wooden performance I've seen in a while. What a poor choice of actor for the lead role, and what a pointless role to begin with anyway. Ken Watanabe is considerably better, but under used in a show of tokenism.<br/><br/>As for Godzilla, he has a couple of beetle-like enemies to contend with here, and the creations are larger than ever. Inevitably CGI is used to animate the monsters and the result is visually impressive; enough money has gone into it to make this a dark and brooding visual experience. As I said before, though, it's only in the action of the last half hour that this starts feeling truly like a Japanese GODZILLA film, which is what I was hoping for the whole time. You could excise the whole, somewhat pointless, first hour and a half and still get the same result."
"therapingunicorn","7","16","29","31 May 2014"," This is a movie that depends on the crowd.
","Why do I say it depends on the crowd? because I literally went to 2 types of crowds in 1 day, first with random cool people(full room) and then with some athletic friends(room was a little empty). So the first time(without my friends) I watched it was amazing with the people around, every time Godzilla landed a strike everybody was like ""OOOOHHHHHHH"" like if it were a fight club circle,especially when the blue glow appeared everybody raised their hands and were like ""WUOAH, WUOAH HERE IT COMES!"" and when Godzilla fired the laser... Oh my god... the yelling.... everyone screaming, even the little kids were scared due to the people screaming. So pretty much we all got out of the theater satisfied and while I got out my friends arrived and told me to join them to watch it again. The room with my friends was kinda empty. My athletic friends barely paid attention and some of them even left, the room was quiet. Even in the fight scene it was quiet, I even tried to motivate them but wow those guys were bored and I was annoyed by that. So I pretty much noticed they got out the theater unsatisfied. This is my conclusion."

","I would give this movie 1 star if it weren't for some good acting by Bryan Cranston in the beginning. Everything about this movie is horrible. I have watched loads and loads of movies from all over the world and this has to be one of the worst. The acting is just terrible and the story is even worse. The plot twists are horrendous. It just didn't make sense that Godzilla swam all the way from japan to San Francisco to fight the MUTOs and then he just swam back after smiling for the cameras. And this movie is rated higher than the movie which came out in 1998. That movie was better off by miles. Some people might have liked it after watching all the CGI in theaters. If you watch it on a small screen you will realize how bad the movie actually is."
"cvholland127","10","28","56","16 May 2014"," See it Twice, it makes all the difference.
","Originally when I went to this movie I gave it a score of 7 out of 10. It had excellent action and great CGI, but to me it felt kind of empty and that it was missing some things. While I don't think there was too little Godzilla, the emphasis is never solely on him; the MUTOs sorta steal the show this way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was a victim of my expectations and hype the first time I saw this as it detracted from the experience. I saw it again last night, and let me tell you, man was I blown away! Even more so than the first time I saw it! How they use Godzilla in this movie is definitely different, but it is truly phenomenal and something special. I can see this movie only improving with time, and being added to the likes of Jaws, Jurassic Park and Alien as sorta classic monster movies.<br/><br/>Additionally, this movie is just fresh. It stands out from all your other token blockbuster flicks like Spiderman and Xmen because of the way the story builds and feels. Again I think this is going to allow this movie to stand time much better than some other more recent blockbusters.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No, but its a hell of a good ride and the best Monster movie you could probably ever see! See the movie with either no expectations or watch it twice and you will realize that this is truly a great work of art."

"Dory_Darko","7","13","23","28 May 2014"," Form over function Once again.
","OK, let me start off by saying that the new Godzilla is definitely an entertaining movie and well worth the price of an admission ticket. That is – so long as you go into it with popcorn-level expectations. Now, it has to be said that the bar, since the most recent attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998 (which was hilarious at best) wasn't set particularly high, to say it nicely. So in all honesty, with today's budget and special effects, it never had a big chance of being that bad. But I have to admit, judging from the trailer – I thought it would be better.<br/><br/>It starts off pretty good. There is proper story build-up and character lay-out. Where we are – what's happening... It's all there. In fact, the story revolving around the main characters is pretty dramatic from the get-go. Death in the family, trauma leading to obsession over finding the truth surrounding the circumstances. Bryan Cranston is impressive as the family father and science guy. He just knows something is up concerning some big beastie and he won't let up until he figures it out. That is – if he gets the chance. Something happens around one third into the movie that is a pivotal turning point in the story. I knew this immediately when it happened and in the end I realised that I had been correct.<br/><br/>From this point on, it's out with the story and in with the action. An almost mind-numbing, pummelling assault of non-stop action. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying it's a lot less interesting than it could have been.<br/><br/>Here's the deal: instead of just one Big Monster, they bring in three. One Godzilla, and two huge insect-like creatures that are only designated as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object). Seriously, they couldn't come up with a proper name? And instead of Godzilla being the big threat to mankind, the MUTO are. In fact, Godzilla turns out to be the good guy because he's the only one that can defeat these insect creeps. This story line is factor one in the reason that this movie isn't what it could have been. Factor two is the plot point that these creatures all feed on nuclear energy instead of ""manburgers"". Consequentially, the only real threat they pose is the massive destruction they cause in big cities (and obviously, the human lives that become casualties by default). It's because of this that there is never any real sense of threat or danger. They don't hunt us, they don't care about us. All they want is nuclear energy and a place to breed. What's worse is, these MUTO take screen time and attention away from the monster who's supposed to be the main antagonist and namesake of the movie! It might as well have been called ""Big Creepy Insects"" instead of ""Godzilla""... <br/><br/>In the end, what we're left with is billions of dollars worth of collateral damage and a big-ass monster who's really kind of a nice guy. Weird.<br/><br/>Still, it's certainly not bad. Aaron Taylor- Johnson does his best at looking very serious and all grown up since his Kick-Ass days, although I am certain that this is definitely one of his less compelling roles. The problem is that from the 1/3 turning point that I mentioned, his character becomes very formulaic and cliché. Our hero even shares an intimate moment of eye contact with Godzilla in the end... Aww.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe spends every moment of his screen time looking shocked and awed... and pretty much nothing else. Juliette Binoche is shamefully underused. I would have loved to have seen more of her. The biggest asset is definitely Bryan Cranston. He's the only one who managed to make his character 3-dimensional and a real human being. He, too, would have definitely deserved a bigger role. In fact, the film probably would have been much better for it.<br/><br/>Visually, everything is very awesome and impressive. The special effects (visual and sound) are top-notch. Every time Godzilla opened his mouth to let out a massive roar, I thought my eardrums were going to pop. It's bone-chilling and very cool. The design of the MUTO is a real treat, they look like giant praying mantises, totally intimidating. The films' SFX really make it worthwhile. <br/><br/>All in all, the story is quite weak and riddled with clichés, though I must say one thing: thank God for the complete lack of obligatory footprints. I was seriously dreading the moment these giant ""claw prints in the mud"" would appear on screen, but thankfully it never happened. The overall feel and setting of this film is quite dark and threatening, and adding such a cliché would have been really dumb and unnecessary. <br/><br/>I had really hoped that this was going to be the definitive Godzilla movie. Alas, it is not. But I still enjoyed it for what it was and I definitely recommend seeing it for the special effects alone. In any case, 'Gojira' looks awesome.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10."

"tecnogaming","2","18","34","26 August 2014"," This movie redefines the concept of ""BAD""
","When I started watching this (that is after the first 20 minutes), a ray of hope invaded my spirit... that is until 20 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>Anything that happened after that period is utter garbage and I can't state enough reasons without making this a bible instead of a review, so I will state a few points.<br/><br/>1- Sound: Really BAD equalization and i mean BAD, like from someone who doesn't know anything about audio. The bass and LFE is so OVER THE PLACE that you can't recognize an explosion from a character walking from a monster screaming... it's all LOUD LOUD LOUD, it's so LOUD that you either cover your ears or throw up. Hint to audio mixer guy: if you put a loud bass to everything you saturate the spectrum, you will loose the shock value and just irritate the viewer.<br/><br/>2- Script: I really don't know why in this world a director will put such good actors to such lame roles, they don't have anything meaningful to say, they just go on about a ""plan to destroy the monsters"" and they go on an on forever.. without ANY character development.<br/><br/>3- Directing: Important parts relegated as non-important, totally unimportant parts taking the front seat in filming. Hint to director: Godzilla fights ARE the main attraction for watching this movie, if you give us 10 seconds of fight and you then put Godzilla onto the background and blurry it out to show 20 minutes of an imbecile trying to device a plan on how to stop Godzilla you should be bound be hated by the viewers. We wanted to SEE GODZILLA not half the movie wasted on stupid military tactics that amounts to ZERO in the movie.<br/><br/>4-Common Sense: Anything that common sense dictates is not present in this movie, the amount of situations in which the characters are trying to resolve it in the worst possible way, and I mean a way which you will scream at the screen ""are you THAT STUPID?"" are excessive. Nothing fits, it's like the director gone straight from the education center to his first movie, he don't have the slightest clue on how to properly do a movie.<br/><br/>5- Shock Value: When the best scare in the whole movie is a group of pigeons impacting a BUS window (I am NOT joking) you know something gone terrible wrong in the process..<br/><br/>Conclusion: When you're watching the movie with your little kids and your 6 years old girl says out loud ""What is this crap??! I wanna see Godzilla!"" you know you're watching a piece crap. (Specially when they loved the previous one).<br/><br/>The previous Godzilla was bad, but if you measure this to the older one you need to completely redesign a set of values in which this movie will be bad and the previous one awesome and this is plain disgusting because this Godzilla looks amazing, but somehow, the director didn't saw appropriate to gives us more of this one and less of the military.<br/><br/>This is the WORST monster movie you will ever see in your life. <br/><br/>Big Ass Spiders! is a lot more fun than this and that was a B-Movie filmed as a B-Movie and the actors were laughing through the movie!."

","About an hour into ""Godzilla,"" my son summed Director Gareth Edward's reboot up with one simple statement. He tapped me on the shoulder and whispered in my ear, ""Dad, this movie is boring except for the fights."" He captured my exact thoughts about almost every film starring the King of the Monsters. I take a mental nap when humans are on screen and get jolted awake by the noise of two giant monsters fighting each other.<br/><br/>Two giant creatures that feed on radioactivity head on a collision course towards each other, destroying everything in their path. Drawn to each other's mating calls, they follow their instincts to the greatest feeding ground on Earth: the nuclear waste dumps of Nevada. Godzilla must stop them before they destroy the world. However, will the he succeed in annihilating them without wiping out the human race in the process?<br/><br/>Nobody watches a ""Godzilla"" movie for the plots or human interaction. Except for the first film's warnings against nuclear devastation, the other entries in the franchise revolve around aliens or diabolical Earthly powers trying to take over the world using some sort of Kaiju. Audiences fumble their way through long stretches of narrative to get to see 20 minutes of Monday Night Smackdown between two giant creatures using Tokyo as a wrestling ring.<br/><br/>If you walk into ""Godzilla"" expecting to see a ""Godzilla"" movie, then you'll be just fine. If you go into it anticipating what I did, you'll probably leave disenchanted. I don't know why, but I was expecting Director Gareth Edwards to up the amount of battle scenes and appearances by our title character. I wanted him to make the ""Godzilla"" flick I wanted to see - less yammering and more hammering.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Godzilla"" isn't bad, but it isn't phenomenal either. Everyone takes the attitude that audiences aren't coming to the movie to see humans, so why put forth too much effort. That's what it felt like to me. After watching so many disaster films over the past few months, I wanted a human story with as much weight as it had wanton giant monster destruction. I think I set myself up for disappointment.<br/><br/>I was quite impressed with most of the CGI in ""Godzilla."" The King of the Monsters looked like the menacing one we've wanted to see all along. There's no signs of a man in a suit to be found here. The MUTOS creatures were much cooler than I expected from seeing still shots of the film.<br/><br/>I did find it amusing that most of the effects-heavy sequences took place at night as to mask any CGI limitations. It's obvious the filmmakers for both this and ""Pacific Rim"" didn't have the type of faith in the quality of their work that Michael Bay does with his ""Transformers"" movies. They keep the Kaiju masked by the dark while Bay rolls his robots out into the exposing rays of the sunlight.<br/><br/>The movie is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of destruction, mayhem and creature violence. There's no gore to be found and very little blood. A few soldiers and bystanders have a little blood caked on them, but that's about it. I was also impressed at the lack of bad language and adult situations. ""Godzilla"" is surprisingly family-friendly and as tame as the older entries in the franchise.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" is, well, a ""Godzilla"" movie. You have to decide for yourself if that's to be considered a good or bad thing. The only difference between this and the older films is a lack of more Japanese people and the absence of a Toho logo at the beginning of the title credits."

","I hate it when the people say there wasn't much action. The original Godzilla focused on the humans, and Godzilla was the result of nuclear activity and taught a very valued lesson about the environment. Godzilla has only had limited amount of screen time through out the movies by TOHO, the creators. The Godzilla from 1998 was a disgrace and wasn't even Godzilla, because TOHO made a movie after that, that kicked 1998's butt. TOHO watched 2014 Godzilla and said it was a fantastic movie, but that wasn't why I went to see it. The movie was great, it had beautiful camera work, and it was suspenseful. The movie kept you on the edge of the seat, and the initial roar from the God himself makes the theater rumble. I'm sure everyone's inner child was satisfied. If you haven't seen the movie, you should. TOHO loves the movie, why shouldn't you? All and all, this movie is a great addition to the Godzilla franchise and I cannot wait for the sequel."

","During the 1950s, creatures are awaken from the deepest depths. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes that ancient creatures exist that lives in radiation. As the radiation faded from the earth's surface, these creatures retreated to the lower depths. In 1999, miners uncover a vast cavern with a giant skeleton in the Philippines. They also find one of the spores broken open. In Japan at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, manager Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife in a freak incident. Fifteen years later, Joe is still investigating the incident with the city around the plant quarantined. He is arrested once again for trying to breach the quarantine. His son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has to leave behind his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) in San Francisco to go pick him up from jail in Japan. Joe convinces Ford who is now a US Navy ordnance disposal officer to join him to go to the plant. They discover that there is no radiation leak. Instead the spore from the Philippines named MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) has settled in the plant sucking up all the radiation.<br/><br/>This is always going to be a great monster movie. The CGI is terrific and Godzilla has a great time smashing things up. That part seems like a no-brainer. I still give director Gareth Edwards credit for doing a great job. He doesn't disappoint. The problem is once again the human story. The beginning is just too long before it gets to a monster. The Joe Brody story doesn't have the bite. In another movie, his story would be a fun mystery. The problem is that the audience knows it's a monster even if it's not Godzilla. So there is no tension from the mystery since it's not really a mystery. The other problem is that Ford just happens to be at the right place in all of those situations. It's a situation that a lesser movie would rely on. I hoped for better. The final problem I have is that the movie cuts away from the monster action time and time again. It's funny the first time but it gets annoying quickly. Despite all the problems, there is still a fun monster movie and lots of stuff get smashed."

","With its predictable PG-13 rating - Godzilla was yet another humdrum, Hollywood production that used the lame excuse of a rampaging, over-sized monster in order to grind ""family values"" into the viewer's face, non-stop.<br/><br/>If you ask me - All that this $160 million movie amounted to was just a sickening family soap opera where big, brave daddy (your typical combat hero/G.I. Joe type) goes to the most ridiculous lengths imaginable in order to rescue his darling, little wifey and his precious, little sonny-boy. And, believe me, it was all pretty revolting stuff. Yep. It sure was.<br/><br/>And, speaking about Godzilla's role in this disappointing movie - Personally, I found the monster battle scenes (which were always filmed in near-darkness) to be so badly staged (and downright clumsy at times) that they actually came across like slapstick comedy, rather than their intended ""dead-serious"".<br/><br/>All-in-all - Godzilla was nothing but pure, recycled family fluff, from start to finish."
"final-fantasyxcjo","6","22","44","14 May 2014"," Pacific Rim > Godzilla
","This was seriously one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. Aaron Taylor Johnson proved that he cannot act a serious role. Part of good monster films in general is when you care about the characters which when Cranston left the film, the human element took a nose dive. Apparently Ford is the only nuclear bomb guy in the whole damn army, the soldiers assigned to protect the nuke, know nothing about it and Olsen is basically a broom stick with a head. Godzilla is a guest star in his own damn movie and even the final fight, they kept cutting away from the monster fight, which was highly annoying. Now i would have been fine with this had i given a crap about any of the characters that remained in the film, but i don't and every time they cut away to see what Ford is doing i was rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>I don't ask for Pacific Rim amount of action, but Godzilla needed much more action, even 10 mins extra screen time would have made this a better film. Pacific Rim had fun with itself and never took itself too seriously and although some characters were uninteresting, what made me care about Pacific Rim when the monsters were away was Idris Elba, proving that had the human element focused on Cranston, the human part would have been much more interesting. <br/><br/>And before you say ""well most early Godzilla films only had Godzilla in it for 20 mins"". Newsflash This isn't the 1960's and 70's. CGI has far advanced and even if Godzilla is only in the film for 15 mins, it could have been much better, instead they cut away just as he is about to fight the MUTO, the first time was acceptable, but by the time number 3 came around me and many of my friends were getting frustrated. <br/><br/>Like man of steel Godzilla is dull, depressing, unfun and soulless. Hopefully Godzilla 2 is far superior, and i do give this film credit for getting Godzilla back in the limelight, but for how much this movie was hyped, the payoff was poor. I give the movie a 6 out of 10, but if you want a fun monster movie go see Pacific Rim."
"Field78","7","9","15","16 May 2014"," Great build-up, less great tear-down
","In a time where remakes and reboots cause increasing rolling of eyes from moviegoers, I think that lots of people weren't sorry to hear that Godzilla would get a make-over. The last incarnation from 16 years ago didn't please too many people, although I have to admit that I had a good time with the pulpy B-movie-type creature-feature that Roland Emmerich delivered. Sure, the script was substandard and most of the actors were out-performed by the beast, but there was plenty of action and random destruction to have a good time.<br/><br/>This reboot, however, takes its subject matter much more seriously, which is good, because Godzilla is a beloved character with a long history, an iconic presence, and an entire mythology that is just waiting to be explored, something the 1998 version infamously didn't. Godzilla isn't a mutated lizard here, but a mythical primordial creature that has been here since the beginning. The opening scenes, where Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins make a startling discovery, which has devastating consequences for Brian Cranston and his family, are great and suspenseful. They set the tone for the first half of the movie, which has a pleasant what-the-hell-is- going-on-here mood. The big budget is used for some spectacular vistas of deserted cities, mass scenes and random destruction, but it does not distract from the plot. Brian Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson take the viewer on a journey to make sense of all their discoveries, and I must say that there are some surprises along the way that the trailers had carefully hidden. Godzilla gets a few enemies in the form of vicious mega-parasites, which makes him the hero for a change, and builds up a lot of anticipation for their confrontation.<br/><br/>It is in the second half where, sadly, those expectations are not all met. Brian Cranston's character meets his unfortunate and unexpected demise, so that Taylor-Johnson gets promoted to the lead. However, he can't match Cranston's rugged charisma and authority, and the dramatic story arc that gave the first half such an impulse gets a bit muddled in the conventional weaknesses inherent to the genre, such as predictability (the monsters just 'happen' to converge where Taylor-Johnson's loved ones are) and excessive disregard for logic (""Let's give the parasites an EMP!"" ""Does that make any sense at all?"" ""No, but it looks cool and makes are heroes vulnerable!""). Elizabeth Olsen is definitely the more talented sibling of the Olsen family, but she is underused in a typical damsel-in-distress role.<br/><br/>Still, I'll gladly look past such weaknesses in an otherwise decent script, but we watch creature features for all the rampaging, mayhem and mass destruction as well. That's where the movie is a bit lacking: Godzilla enters quite late; we see him very sparingly, pushing away some ships and taking some fire; the parasites squash a few people and tear down one or two buildings, but most of the carnage occurs off-screen or through a monitor. There is lots of collateral damage, but too often we only see the aftermath or just a trail of destruction; when Godzilla and the parasites are about to face-off, the camera quickly cuts away. I understand that they were probably saving it for the finale, which was satisfactory, but the climax felt a bit rushed and underwhelming in light of all the waiting. I did not expect to ever say this, but with a little more focus on action than on story, I would have been more thrilled and on the edge of my seat. I had several things to say against Pacific Rim, but that movie DID show a whole range of death matches between large creatures beating the hell out of each other, that made up for all the silliness and plot holes in the script. On the plus side, the special effects look great and very realistic, and the disaster scenes that we get to see are convincing.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, I think that this is the story treatment that Godzilla deserves, but not necessarily the movie. He seems to be playing a supporting role in his own movie, and although this may have been done as to not take away the mystery, I hope that he can claim his rightful leading role in the inescapable sequel."

","Sometimes the very best films are unintentionally funny, however it is with a heavy heart I inform you that the only unintentionally funny thing about this film is the cavalcade of comedic wigs donned by Bryan Cranston's character. I have seen more convincing hairpieces at a pensioner's pool party in Boca Raton. The only thing that was missing was a Hawaiian shirt, short shorts and a pick up line that begins with ""Hey baby...."".<br/><br/>The movie has a stellar cast, with two Oscar winners and three Oscar nominees but you would never know it. Juliette Binoche was clearly taking the money and running, gone in 60 seconds (literally) and Ken Watanabe is as lifelike as the Oscar he won. Watanabe stomps leaden footed through most of his scenes garbling his lines but when it comes to stomping, who does it better than Godzilla? Sure the film is called Godzilla but...where IS GODZILLA? It's like some sort of absurdist piece. The titular head of the movie appears only sometimes, and we are first forced to endure a good thirty minutes of scene-setting and bad wigs. Godzilla appears more like the original Japanese version and there is some hat-tipping to the origins of the film franchise, but apart from that...we are still waiting for Godzilla. Not only is Godzilla hard to find in this hard slog of a film, but when Godzilla isn't just stomping over landmarks he is noshing on some sort of angry flying leftover from the film Starship Troopers. He isn't an angry refugee from atomic testing, he is a hungry behemoth who unintentionally saves the world. It's a good thing too...because NOTHING saves this film. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen runs the gamut of emotions from A to...well A. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, MUST be better in other films, because he makes Godzilla look life-like and believable. It is for Sally Hawkins that my heart breaks. She is an outstanding actress, and just this year was rightfully nominated for an Oscar for Blue Jasmine. What was she doing here? What was she doing signing on for this film? She was virtually invisible as the handmaiden to Watanabe, and although she is the only one who it can be said of, was actually acting, she was wasted and lost in the carnage and close ups of Cranston and Watanabe. My final sorrowful song is sung to David Strathairn who is also an Oscar nominated actor, and is deservedly considered one of America's finest character actors. However, therein, lies the problem. In order for one to be a character, one must have a character to inhabit. Strathairn blinks his way through this film seemingly oblivious to the mess around him. It must make it easier when your resume includes, ""Lincoln"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" to simply not move and hope no one notices you. <br/><br/>Most good stories start with a fundamental list of ingredients: the initial situation, conflict, complication, climax, suspense, denouement, and conclusion. None of these ingredients will be found in Godzilla. They are simply not applicable. In ""Waiting for Godot"" Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes. As scholar David Bradby says in his criticism of Godot, this is an understatement: ""less than nothing happens.""<br/><br/>That same criticism can be made of Godzilla, or as I have called it, ""Waiting for Godotzilla."""

","*WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS: If you want to see the movie don't read this*<br/><br/>Yesterday I saw the biggest movie of the year ""Godzilla"". First I'm going to tell you the things I didn't like about the movie; as the usual Godzilla tradition the human parts of the film were boring and I could really care less about Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Next if you were expecting an ending credits scene you'll be disappointed as there are non so I advise not to stay for the credits; I was hoping for Mothra to appear because the director said to look for a cameo. I saw a bunch of butterflies and moths around the movie so I was thinking Mothra were to be in the unannounced sequel. Also the original Godzilla theme was not in the movie, instead it was a remix that sounded a bit similar to the original. Finally the main reason I was a little disappointed was (HUGE SPOILER) Bryan Cranston because they made him sound like a main character but instead they kill him off after the first 20 minutes of the film. Anyways now back to the good, Godzilla is back and more powerful than ever. I hope it doesn't sound like I'm exaggerating when I say the special effects are triple that of the Avengers, literally the best CGI to date. The battle scenes are perhaps the best Godzilla fights I've ever seen. I like how they made him a hero this time around, I always hated it when they turn him into a villain. Godzilla's atomic breath is amazing to see especially in IMAX 3D (by the way first IMAX experience). My favorite scene of all is Godzilla's final attack when he looks like his about to rip the jaw off a kaiju like King Kong, but goes a step further by using his atomic breath to cut its head off while roaring at the top of his lungs.<br/><br/>The final verdict I give this movie a 9.8 out of 10. This is now officially my 4th favorite film of all time, above Die Hard and below Avengers, Gremlins, and Star Wars. I highly recommend you go see it whether your a Godzilla fan or not.

As for the humans...<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards' Godzilla is average blockbuster stuff, with a boring mid section, mildly engaging but still drab climax with a few - it must be said very and gigantic - impressive special effects, and a strong first act highlighted by a very entertaining Bryan Cranston performance, who almost feels like part of another, better Godzilla movie we won't get to see. Aside from his enjoyable over the top acting, his character was the most interesting as far as exploring the mystery and even mythology behind these Radioactive beasts.<br/><br/>And then he just leaves the movie, for reasons that should be obvious, and we are stuck with... Ken Watnabe as the lamest scientist I've seen in a while (he is there in the role, but he's one-note), David Strathairn relegated to being a military stiff, a usually decent Aaron Taylor Johnson doing passable work as the stone cold hero (he even saves a would-be short round!), and is mostly like everyone else left to spew out clichés, and Elizabeth Olson is good and believable, for the few minutes she's allowed screen time to hit the same concerned mother-wife notes.<br/><br/>I mention all the actors because it's clear that Gareth Edwards, who previously made the low-fi fifteen grand movie Monsters that did a lot with so little, has assembled a top shelf cast and has a massive budget to work with. But the script he is working with is just too rote, what we've seen in other, sillier, dare I say better Godzilla movies of yore. Lets see: monsters of some radioactive hidden origin come up, as does the big bad green one himself, and they duke it out in a city. Only this time why have any fun with your cast when such dreadful things like radioactive creatures and such? Why not make it look drab and gray and ugly as possible? <br/><br/>There are little things to like about the movie, aside from the aforementioned Cranston acting, such as a small set piece right before the third act gets into the swing of things where soldiers fall out from a plane seen from afar in red streaks and the scene is scored to the same space-flight music by Ligeti in 2001: A Space Odyssey. And, to be sure, sure the special effects, when they aren't obscured inside of TV frames or in darkness, are impressive. Hell, when Godzilla does take up space and becomes large and in charge, for a few minutes here and there, it's engaging. Yet I can't look over how the results are just too same old same old, and on the flip side I don't think Edwards and company get us invested enough in the humans. It's a given that it's a step-up from the last time, in 1998 with Roland Emmerich, Hollywood tackled Japan's Big One. I just wish it had more... something to it, like characters."

It has the same major problem that all these kinds of films do: the human element is lacking. Severely here. And what a fantastic cast to waste! Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe! Every single one of them utterly wasted. Hopefully they all got a big check.

Show us the damn fight!! and don't get me started on those 2 Stupid teasers during the movie.

","I have seen a lot of awesome movies before this moviebut now that I have seen THIS movie, they all seem..waste!! THAT's how good this movie is!! This is not a movie, it's an experienceof a lifetime! And I'm very happy that I saw this movie first day, first show in an IMAX theatre! Any other (normal theatre) wouldn't do justice to the special effects. Though the theatre was housefull, throughout the movie, I didn't hear ONE word from anyone..not even from the kids in the audience. The only sound I heard was myself saying ""Awesome"" quite a lot during the show! I had seen the previous Godzilla movie released some years back. But the trailers for this movie is what prompted me to see it..and boy, I am one very happy person. I had expected the story to be the same as the one in previous Godzilla movie but (thankfully) it was quite different!! Luckily, the trailers didn't show ANY of the ""other elements"" of the movie. So, if you go to see this movie without knowing anything about the story, like me, then you will enjoy it MUCH more. I am not going to tell anything more about the story as I don't want to provide any spoilers. But sadly, IMDb has already provided a major spoiler in it's ""Storyline"" section. So , DON'T read that! One thing I did not like in the movie was that most of the main characters , especially Ford Broody and Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, weren't that appealing. They both seemed bit dull and passive, compared to Joe Brody , the only character that I liked. He was very convincing in his role. Anyway, the humans in this movie should be considered irrelevant. They do become irrelevant as the movie progresses and the focus directly and indirectly shifts to Godzilla. Another complaint that I have is that the movie suddenly seems to get over! I mean, it's not that the movie is incomplete or something. But once ""things get settled"", suddenly the movie gets over! I would have expected that at least they would have shown people talk about Godzilla and his actions. Anyway, not a big deal. The major appeal of the movie is it's special effects. Simply of the best ever. And the story is pretty good. And the direction amazing. Do watch this one. Doesn't get any bigger than this!"

","OK, first off I am kind of angry with some of the critics. Don't go into a GODZILLA based movie with monsters and expect this awesome plot that will blow your mind. What you should expect is great cgi, monsters, and things freaking blowing the hell up. They delivered with flying colors on that note. There were parts in the movie that my mouth dropped with excitement. They went all out on the cgi effects. It was a lot of fun to watch. Go into this movie with action and monsters in mind PLEASE!

"cowboybebop2021","10","23","48","14 May 2014"," Gareth Edwards - The Next Steven Spielberg!
","In an age where visual effects such as CGI is what sells a blockbuster movie and ultimately is what the film mostly consists of with big-headed Directors who think they know what audiences want (I'm looking at you Michael Bay...), here comes our one light in the darkness: Gareth Edwards.<br/><br/>Anyone who saw Gareth's earlier film 'Monsters' knows how impressive it was and how inspirational this person has become, going from a low-budget debut to a massive scale movie like this but what's even more impressive is his admirable restraint in visual effects with extremely high-budget and resources. <br/><br/>Godzilla is actually shown through glimpses and teases at first, which eventually builds up tremendously to one of the greatest movie climaxes I've ever seen! The characters are surprisingly developed and greatly interwoven with the monster set-pieces. It's really clever how they connected these two plot lines and how they balance off each other. The main character is especially interesting in the fact that he goes through the same things Godzilla goes through. When the big creature stumbles, he also stumbles. When Godzilla is put down, he shares an eerie glance at Ford Brody which represent the bigger themes of this movie.<br/><br/>What's great about the themes/subtexts of the film is that it respects and pays homage to the original 1954 Gojira, but it doesn't wink to the audience or cut short on the ideas. Early character arcs are established to show nuances within the tone of the film and the screenplay by Max Borenstein complements this with appropriately fantastic writing and dialog - much resemblance to classics like Jurassic Park and Jaws. In the end, everything comes full circle and Godzilla is shown as an anti-hero - the way he should be.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Godzilla is not only the greatest monster movie of all time, but a refreshing and spectacularly smart film that shows restraint and compassion in times of inconsiderate film-makers who make movies for money and not for the love of the movie-goer.<br/><br/>(10/10)"
"bridgeschey","10","20","41","19 May 2014"," Great movie!
","The movie was well done. I appreciate how snippets of the original Godzilla score/music was incorporated all through out this new film. For those who has seen the first Gojira, the sound aspect injected intermittently in G.Edward's version sort of sends out to the viewers a nostalgic feeling of the old film. The storyline though deviated sharply from the original which worked out well. I guess the film-makers felt the need for adjustments for the present era of moviegoers. Popular news sites have written about a sequel. Many commenters are all for another sequel. But for me personally, quality Godzilla movies such as this last one should only come out no less than 10 years at a time to keep the anticipation but mainly that Godzilla is a special gem. Or like a plant that flowers only every so often that stay hidden for a time but when it blooms, it blooms with spectacle. OK, flower and Godzilla doesn't match- I can't find a better comparison but you know what I mean. I had rather wait another 15 years of a really good Godzilla movie than see a B-quality every 2 or 3 years. Godzilla is a majestic and grand figure. In movie history, there's no monster (or whatever you call it) that commands such awe. It deserved every cent of its $160 million budget."
"ajgizzarelli","2","2","2","15 April 2020"," WAAAAAAY too dark

","So forgettable that I forgot I watched it after seeing it.<br/><br/>Godzilla's 2014 remake is a modern take on the classic movie with a lot more CGI. Yet, it doesn't bring anything innovative or new to the table. All the cliches have been done since the classic. Audiences will yawn at the storyline and plot devices. It's the same tale we've seen a thousand times of a giant kaiju causing destruction that's somehow...good?<br/><br/>2/5.

"LJ27","1","2","2","6 June 2019"," The Godzilla movie for people who hate Godzilla movies
","So, I watched the trailer for this and saw a lot of destruction scenes, several of which are not in the movie, a few scenes of Godzilla, several of which are not in the movie and the guy from the show, BREAKING BAD, and I think almost all his scenes are in the trailer. He's barely in the movie. There is another ""actor,"" who plays the lead when the guy you thought was the lead suddenly stops being in the movie. There are some monsters in the movie but they aren't the ones you expect, especially when you paid to see a movie called, GODZILLA. Even when the main attraction finally shows up, he's mostly confined to reflections in windows and on
TV monitors. If you enjoyed the movie, THE VILLAGE, after seeing the trailer for it, you will love this version of GODZILLA. If you really just pretty much hate Godzilla movies, then this is the movie you've been waiting for, because you won't have to worry about seeing him
much. The director cuts away to
something far less interesting anytime you think you're about to see him. If you could give the same crew and budget to director, Ed Wood, of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE fame, I bet even he probably could have made something more entertaining than this endurance test, that costs the price of a movie ticket. I still don't see how they messed this movie up so bad, but the problem started when they promised the audience things they didn't deliver...such as a giant radioactive lizard monster."

For the past 60 years, Godzilla has lived in Japan winning fans for its/his unique characteristics, his manlike personalities and his act to save the human mankind. Secondly, I applaud the director for making the Godzilla from the 1998 film look like a joke. The 2014 version is a movie created for Godzilla fans and that's why it gets the praise. If you enjoyed the movie Cloverfield like I did, and if you heard of Godzilla and expect nothing like a romance movie or a documentary film. You should go see this movie."

","Now, don't get me wrong, Godzilla (2014) was a good movie. It did what it was suppose to do BUT, I do have some issues with it starting with Bryan Cranston's lack of screen time. The trailers would have made you believe Bryan Cranston plays a very big role in the movie but, he doesn't. He had the least screen time out of all the other actors.<br/><br/>Also, for a movie called ""Godzilla"", you really don't see Godzilla a whole lot. I take it back, Bryan Cranston had more screen time than Godzilla. Nonetheless, Godzilla (2014) was AMAZINGLY better than the 1998 adaptation. And I have to give credit, where credit is due, Gareth Edwards managed to bring back an iconic feature from the old Godzilla films, something the '98 disaster failed horribly to do. <br/><br/>Overall, good entertaining movie. I didn't really feel worried for the characters in the film, for they didn't really leave an impact on the movie."

At least there had to be something in this extremely expensive movie worth liking, but no. To my surprise, many big film critics actually gave this film a high ranking, on rotten tomatoes it scores high.<br/><br/>But this is definitely one of the worst films i have ever seen. The first 20 minutes builds promise, but after that the movie falls completely flat on poor acting, bad storytelling, bad directing, bad visual effects, bad script.. yeah well, there is really nothing i liked.<br/><br/>But hey who cares right?. The movie made tons of money in the cinema, so Hollywood did it again. Lets make movies for 10 year olds who can't understand drama and originality. Using this recipe you just throw in recycled love stories, meaningless effects, a story written just so you can show off as much effects as possible, hire a bad director because he wont charge you that much, hire completely useless and inexperienced script writers because they don't dare to ask for a salary, and pay Bryan Cranston a million bucks to appear in a small role (so that in the trailer, they give you the impression the movie is really serious and great).<br/><br/>Well..

"funkstar186","1","26","57","22 August 2014"," Just, just.......just awful
","I rarely leave any reviews. Mainly because I don't usually feel the need to as I normally find something good, something likable, something to grasp onto and enjoy in most movies. <br/><br/>I'm the kind of guy who'll see any movie for what it is; give it some cheesy, low-budge horror, or sickly sweet romcom, I'm good with most things - but this...This to me is the worst. This American, blockbuster'esqe, CGI enriched, hoo-rah, 'more visual than story' nonsense is just too much. <br/><br/>I'm starting to wonder what it is that drives the Hollywood execs to consider this as an 'OK' film to release. Has it got to the point where it's OK just to plough nonsensical amounts of money into CGI and just forget about any kind of storyline? Is it that they forget that there's more than just the people that enjoy movies that live outside of America? No offense to my American brethren, but is this what you guys consider to be a good movie these days?? <br/><br/>I'm not sure what's going on in the world of American movies these days, especially where Hollywood's concerned.

"DJAkin","1","22","47","20 May 2014"," The worst movie
","I thought I had seen some bad movies, but the new Godzilla takes the cake. Spiderman 2 was terrible but not nearly as awful as Godzilla. All the things you see in the previews are fake. Bryan Cranston dies early on and has a role that is demeaning for such a brilliant actor. If you are expecting to see Heizenberg from Breaking Bad, don't get your hopes up. There is no similarity between the two characters. Oh, and the moth monsters? They were so obviously fake looking that my nephew could have made them on his iPad. The CG these days is just terrible. I am not sure who directed this movie but the way it was directed was extremely poor. The casting for the movie was awful as well. Whoever those two main characters were, were very miscast. Oh, and about Godzilla? Did he knock planes out of the sky? No he didn't. That was an EMP. I am furious that this movie was made. The Godzilla monster screamed and it was so obviously a rip off of dinosaurs that I laughed. When Godzilla started breathing fire like a dragon, I laughed my ass off. How much of a rip off is that? Can you saw SMAUG? The ending was terrible also. Godzilla just swims off in the ocean. Oh, and the Ocean turned into a tsunami when Godzilla appeared? Yeah right, there is no way that would happen. Everything about this movie was beyond terrible. I should have skipped this movie. Shame on the director for making this movie. My life is truly a tad worse for having experienced such trash."
"samuel_handy","10","9","16","18 May 2014"," Honest Confusion
","This is a hard film to review, so from here on I'm going to pretend as if I have never seen a Godzilla film before and this is my first.<br/><br/>Firstly, Godzilla is a brilliantly crafted monster movie full of action, suspense and breathtaking scenes. Gareth Edwards uses techniques similar to that of Cloverfield. He incorporates a lot of shaky first-person camera shots from the people's perspective, this gave you a spectacular idea of how huge each monster was which left you feeling greatly intimidated and insignificant. Mr. Edwards was brilliant at building suspense and tension using obscured shots of each monster, gradually revealing them over time leaving you more and more curious and frightened. Overall, the monsters were portrayed brilliantly. <br/><br/>The let down I felt was how this was very similar to that of the Cloverfield 'point of view', not that it is a bad thing with the monster(s) having a haunting presence in the background. But if you're going to focus on the human characters, then they need to be more interesting! The characters were brilliantly portrayed by each actor & actress, it was just a shame the writers could only come up with such 2- dimensional roles to lead the film. And for the characters you fell in love with, well they barely had any screen time and if they died, it just felt unnecessary rather than being surprising and jaw-dropping, it just left you feeling irritated. <br/><br/>Finally, with such great suspense and build up we were left with a climax that was visually stunning and heart-racing but only for a couple minutes. After it was done and we were left with a questionable ending, I was sat there thinking ""is that it..?"". After all the fuss, it felt like a premature climax that was executed well but didn't feel as if it lasted as long as it should have.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt Godzilla was a well-crafted entertaining monster movie that I could definitely watch again. Just needed more monster mashing! <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Now from a Godzilla fan:<br/><br/>I Had high expectations which I felt were met in some aspects. I still appreciate and agree with everything I mentioned before, but as a Godzilla fan, I'm used to Godzilla being the main character and the center of all the action. The MUTOs got way more attention and for a 'Godzilla film', the star of the show was barely in it which left me disappointed. <br/><br/>The climax I felt was pathetic which made me think the writers had never seen a Godzilla film before. Although I appreciated the whole realistic animal fighting which was rather similar to that of two bears mauling at each other rather than those WWE moves back in the day, there was just NOT ENOUGH of it. I left the cinema thinking half the film was hidden away from view. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the first-person point of views which were very effective, but this being a Godzilla film, I was desperate for more aerial shots of 3 monsters fighting to the death with huge amounts of destruction. But these moments were only teased and the camera would then resume to characters I honestly didn't care for because they were so 2- dimensional. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was brilliantly directed with great acting all round, but the 'love' for Godzilla just wasn't there and at the end when it was, it was way too super-imposed. It felt like it was a Cloverfield sequel with 3 brilliant monsters where one of them happened to resemble and/or look a lot like Godzilla rather than it being Godzilla. <br/><br/>... Oh, and he did use his atomic breathe which I thought was such a relief and left me feeling like a giddy little kid again. The honest confusion here is this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. The 'love' for Godzilla was here and there, but it needed to be let out of the cage more! I am looking forward to a sequel, because if there is any movie that can get away with a sequel, it's Gojira."

","Gareth Edwards brings Godzilla into a whole new realm of monster movie. His adaption is intense, well written, and most of all beautiful. Godzilla has never looked better. In fact, no movie creature has ever looked this good, (I saw it in IMAX, which I highly recommend). Godzilla and the other creatures are truly terrifying. The movie is less from the overall perspective of the monsters, but instead a perspective of the people. This idea initially got me worried, being the huge fan I am, but I could not have been more satisfied. Edwards did a great job of integrating classic aspects of the old movies to life all these years later. The action scenes were stunning and heart pounding. And to add to it all, the characters had real motives which brought a whole new realness to the Godzilla story. They integrated him into real history which was very clever, and made the whole situation quite believable. If you're a die-hard fan or just a movie lover, this will not disappoint. One thing is for sure, spend the money to see it on the big screen, it will be worth it!"

","After all the hype and anticipation, I expected to be entertained. I wasn't. This movie is about a pair of insect-monsters dubbed Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms, or MUTOs. (groan) Godzilla is a secondary character at best. Another reviewer mentioned MST3K. I had the same thought. That's where this bomb belongs.<br/><br/>The plot and script are a train wreck. I wasn't anticipating an intellectual exercise. After all, it's a monster movie. However, it's set in the present day so I did expect it to have a quasi-sensible storyline and progression of events. Nope! Not even close. <br/><br/>There's lots of mayhem and destruction but it doesn't make up for all of this films shortcomings. With top-notch effects people on the project, I expected great effects throughout. Well, some are great, some are OK and others are flat out cheesy, which I found confusing and distracting.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself? Excellent. Loved him. That said, he doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the film. I was bored and annoyed by the time he showed up. Adding insult to injury, he had minimal screen time. This Godzilla was so cool that he should have been on screen from start to finish.<br/><br/>Lastly, the soundtrack is deafening. Personally, I like loud. I appreciate it most when it occurs as punctuation in appropriate places. In Godzilla you're assaulted with such a relentlessly high decibel level that it becomes difficult to follow what's happening.<br/><br/>This is by far the most disappointing Godzilla movie I've ever seen."

Some of them could have been cut shorter.. for example, the scene where the main character's mom died could have been 1 or 2 minutes shorter, or better yet, it should have just been left out and instead just present it as a short anecdote. They tried to make it look so dramatic how she died, even though it was just a few minutes into the movie... that's just unnecessary and silly.<br/><br/>As for the action scenes... Too few & too brief. The only memorable scene was the atomic breath scene. Without that scene, I would have probably given this movie a 2/10 or maybe even a 1.<br/><br/>This movie has a 7.1 IMDb rating because of the atomic breath scene and the hype from all the fans.

The expense was too high.... his screen time though is ideal. He doesn't need more. He needs 10 or 20 or 30 minutes to conquer his film. His roar.... damn.... chills...... the mutos were really nice.... sympathetic and pretty strong enemies. The atomic breath was perfect.... they nailed it... the glow... and the breath itself. The acting was nice, the one who excelled was Bryan Cranston. Wow... to be honest I didn't know him, but he was astonishing. His acting almost brought me to tears 3 times. Amazing. A perfect movie to spend your afternoon. I recommend it 100% 10/10 by me for an excellent movie"

","this movie is not pacific rim (not mindless action) ,this movie is about the humans and one hero who fought for us, non Godzilla fans will never like this movie but Gareth Edwards did an spectacular job for the fans,letting animals be like animals , i hope they wont make a sequel because for me this movie was perfect and if the do they will kill Godzilla ,the movies teasing wasn't the best tho i wish they teased by showing the monster fights from a distance that would be great.I loved all the human characters ,Bryan Cranston,Aron Taylor's,Ken Watanabe, Every one i loved them. and Gareth showed something new about Godzilla , is that Godzilla's emotional side, of course he is an animal,he suppose to have one but when he was dying to protect Ford and the rest of the humans , I was crying for Godzilla, i have never done that before in the previous movies,i left the movie with tears of joy that's why i say this movie is of the hook."
"bigwan","10","11","21","26 May 2014"," A refreshing take on Godzilla..
","The king of monsters is back and better than ever! After the 1998 ""Godzilla"" movie I was worried we would never get another truly great ""Godzilla"" flick. But along comes Gareth Edwards, who made the indie movie ""Monsters"", to breathe new life into the giant lizard. Brief side note, ""Monsters"" was the 1st movie I ever wrote a review on for rotten tomatoes. It was about 2 sentences long:-p This movie is awesome and succeeds where ""Pacific Rim"" fails, but where that movie succeeds, is what holds this back. There is a some truly awesome monster fighting here, but I do wish there was more. I liked all the human actors, but I do wish there was more Godzilla. Having said that, what Godzilla there is, it's amazing. He looks phenomenal, and there's more than a couple times during the movie where you will want to cheer. The effects are amazing, and the overall story is pretty good. Heard there is a sequel on the way, and I cannot wait. The more Godzilla, the better! Great Summer movie to just sit down, chow on some popcorn and get lost in the carnage.<br/><br/>watch movie Godzilla 2014 online stream visit http://gg.gg/kaiju2014<br/><br/>Overall, Godzilla is not only a very good summer blockbuster, I think its the best movies I've seen this year so far. The action is fantastic, the effects are top notch, the acting is incredible, and it's entertaining as hell. My words can not do this film justice, just see the movie for yourself and make your own conclusion"
"starry42","10","11","21","21 May 2014"," A thrilling (and at times emotional) thrill ride from beginning to end!
","Godzilla is back! Sure Roland Emmerich may have tried to resurrect the King of Monsters back in '98, but his efforts failed, and his lack of support from Toho may have been the cause. But Toho learned from their mistakes this time around, and it shoes. This blockbuster reminds us of why we love the Godzilla movies so much. Asides from Godzilla, there are also some well developed human characters, who (unlike the '98 film) we actually care about, thanks in part to wonderful performances by great actors, especially Bryan Cranston. What really makes this film worthwhile is the fact that Godzilla is not the only monster in it. That's right, two others appear, and we get a classic monster brawl much like in older Godzilla movies. If your a fan of Toho movies, check it out. It does not disappoint. I can definitely see a new franchise starting out with this film, and I can't wait to see where they go with future sequels. *insert Godzilla roar*"
"erinkay641","10","11","21","18 May 2014"," Amazing Film - A Must See!
","Very minor spoilers involving characters, nothing plot-wise. <br/><br/>I was thoroughly impressed by this film. I think all the criticism about not showing Godzilla on camera enough shows the true caliber of moviegoers these days. They don't want substance, they want explosions and a minimal amount of barely passable plot. This is why there have been four Transformer movies, because people keep paying for and somehow enjoying mediocrity. <br/><br/>That being said, this film was beautiful. One of the most frightening parts is the initial mystery shrouding the non-human characters. The director spent a good portion of time on character development and you really feel for the emotions of each and every character, including Godzilla and the MUTO. The pacing is perfect. I was never bored and nothing felt rushed. The climax of the film was just that - a climax. The entire movie wasn't epic battles and explosions, but it built the entire time and MAN was it rewarding and awesome to watch the ending. <br/><br/>The cast was spot on. Everyone was perfect in their roles. You can tell they spent time finding the right people for the roles, even the characters with only one or two lines. My biggest commendation goes to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the lead actor in this movie. Previously, I had only seen him in the Kick-Ass movies, and the transformations he made for this role are incredible. He clearly has a lot of acting range and emotional depth that is rare nowadays. The Kick-Ass movies were good, don't get me wrong, but I can say with confidence that this just secured him a spot among the A-listers. I truly hope he gets the recognition he deserves for his performance in this film. <br/><br/>In short, this film is epic and it is a must see. It was more of an experience than any movie I have seen in theaters lately. Sometimes you are just watching a film, and sometimes you are granted the good fortune to become immersed in one, and this was definitely the latter."

"Snuzzlescuf","5","13","26","19 May 2014"," This was upsetting
","I have been anticipating this movie for a long while and was stoked to see it upon release. But I didn't. I was nervous because of the impending redux of the icon, and waited for some reviews to pop up. Needless to say, they were high and very praiseworthy.<br/><br/>But when I watched this, I wanted to go in with an even playing field. I wanted to see this as a standalone movie, as well as a franchise funhouse. Sadly, I was checking my watch constantly. Bryan Cranston carried this movie as far as his character could, creating a very stable and honest personality with some backbone, albeit in an awkwardly- dialogued role. The rest of the cast, however, were thrown together in a way that bored me to tears, especially the main lead by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Having been a fan of Aaron's past roles, this was one of his weakest. The attempt of emotion came off as over-dramatic at times where there wouldn't be as much emotion, while he brushed off the more somber and grounded moments. Could be a strong character, but he just came off as a wooden actor. His character's role is to keep the movie rolling, and I get that; but at least present him in a way that doesn't rely on simplistic stock writing. Ken Watanabe didn't really do anything in this movie except stare off into space and tell the military to let a bunch of giant monsters duke it out (and, at any point of this movie, I would've totally agreed) and playing the mother nature card. Elizabeth Olsen and Carson Bolde's characters were only there so we could ""root"" for our protagonist, but honestly, they could been taken out of the film and I wouldn't have even noticed.<br/><br/>The M.U.T.O.s (or what I thought would be Mothra), looked pretty decent, except they had a striking resemblance to the Cloverfield monster. There wasn't much originality to these creatures, more like staples of generic monsters to give Godzilla a motive to be in the movie (acceptable). Speaking of which, Godzilla's new model almost made me shed a tear. He looks beautiful and I was totally into him. In comparison to his older designs, this one gave me goosebumps... Too bad he doesn't show up until an hour and a half into the movie. The build up was almost worth it, until he was gone in about two minutes after that.<br/><br/>In fact, said monster that the movie is named after is only in the film for about 20 minutes. The M.U.T.O.s had more screen time than our hero, but man, each time you get to catch a glimpse of him, it's freaking magic... until they cut back to our generic cast of militia. I was very happy to see Godzilla's signature moves, though (Atomic breath and tail whip), and the battle scene was an adrenaline ride, for it's lengthy 5 minutes.<br/><br/>But on the topic of Godzilla's short appearance, I'd like to say there's a difference from building tension and prodding the viewer. The first few glimpses of Godzilla were great, and I was totally digging it. You see Godzilla a few times here and there, and it gets you ready to dig into the main course. Then, he finally appears, roaring in Honolulu (freaking badass and amazing) and then suddenly it cuts AGAIN (but that's okay, it's still just the beginning). After seeing him swimming through the water 5 times, there's only so much you can take of snapshots and reeling you in with the same scene. As a fan of monster movies, so I get the intention, but the execution was just lax and got real stale pretty quick.<br/><br/>This isn't the worse Godzilla movie, it's just a different time. It plays off of the original and the story is thrown together because, screw it, it's Godzilla. The idea of the hydrogen bomb being used to kill off the M.U.T.O.s was a great touch, and having other monsters in the movie besides Godzilla was a homage to the different monsters developed by Toho. The movie sets out to get feedback on how the monster is influencing the humans, but could the writers at least throw in something to look at? At least from a critical standpoint, the fans of the franchise can agree the characters aren't memorable because they are cardboard cutouts of every generic character ever made. How can the main lead just blow in the wind and expect to carry us through 2 hours of ""building tension""? They used generic monsters doing Godzilla's job: destroying the city and scaring people.<br/><br/>I'm not too sure how I feel about Godzilla siding with the humans (protecting them, letting them follow him, etc.), and I want to dig into this deeper, but I'm just upset that my expectations weren't met. VFX can only carry a movie so far, and when the camera is pointed at living people and actors, it's hard not to get swept up in wanting more of a main course. I will say, that seeing a new ""Godzilla movie"" was a thrill, and although this was a little stale in my opinion, hopefully this will get the icon back into the mainstream."
"GaryBreslin2011","1","13","26","18 May 2014"," Boring, Stupid and Downright awful
","Other than the first 25 minutes or so of this film it was terrible. Bryan Cranston made an excellent performance which gave me more hope that it would be good however from the moment he died it didn't entertain me from then on.<br/><br/>There were some very poor and boring action sequences and by the end of the film i just wanted them to stop.<br/><br/>The story was probably the worst thing and the writing was just lazy. Again not including Bryan Cranstons emotional and entertaining moments there was nothing actually telling the story it is trying to tell. It tries to keep a story through Ford and his family but lets face it does anyone really care about them.<br/><br/>Overall this film just didn't impress, i will admit it had some great special effects but the film itself was poor and i lost interest quite early in and it was not able to get it back."

","Why is holly-crap insist on making rubbish remakes? The only reason I went and saw this movie was because of ""Walter White"". The only interesting part of the movie was with Cranston. I liked the intense build up , that was pretty much it. Why kill of Cranston and let his rubbish son of a actor lead? This movie would have been excellent if Cranston had followed through, they just should have killed the son. <br/><br/>This movie was extremely boring! Me and my brother fell asleep ,people were leaving the theater. 90 minutes of pointless fillers, rubbish editing. Why would you cut a fight scene with Godzilla and the mutant cockroach over and over again? <br/><br/>this is up there with Man of steel and pacific rim.

"mikeyyates333","10","17","36","17 May 2014"," America did it and I left in tears!
","This movie was incredible. I have seen all 28 Toho Godzilla films, I live and breath for Godzilla. What Tristar did to Godzilla 1998 was so bad that 10 years ago in Godzilla Final Wars, Toho Godzilla kills Zilla in one shot. I don't understand why people are bitching about this movie in terms of acting.<br/><br/>Really it's about Godzilla and the characters did a great job telling the proper origin of Godzilla. Sure it may not be the origin story from the 1991 Godzilla vs King Ghidorah. Where there was this dinosaur on an island protecting the soldiers in Japan in WWII but still being the Alpha predator was bad ass because it led to the end of the movie saying he is the King of the Monsters.<br/><br/>Going into this movie I had a checklist that this movie needed to pass in order for it be perfect:<br/><br/>Doesn't die by the military, doesn't lay eggs, Godzilla is male, doesn't eat fish, is massive and breaths the atomic breath. Not fire, breath atomic breath. Not only they did all this but they included new monsters which I thought was fantastic even though it looked like the Terminator version of the Cloverfield monster which I still loved the design. <br/><br/>As for the humans, I felt Aaron Taylor Johnson was a bit flat and I wish Bryan Cranston didn't die so early. I was hoping him and Dr. Serizawa (props to them calling Ken Watanabe Dr. Serizawa) would team up and figure out the Godzilla problem but oh well. The HALO jump was awesome and overall best acting I've seen in a Godzilla movie. <br/><br/>This Godzilla movie was perfect and I wouldn't change a single thing. I had an emotional breakdown and left with tears of joy I hope for sequels.﻿"

"user-543-975655","10","15","31","26 May 2014"," Revived My Interest In Godzilla
","This movie is easily the best Godzilla movie I have ever seen. Gareth Edwards did such a good job at remaking the classic I had a hard time getting up when I had to go to the bathroom. :) I knew as soon as I saw the opening credits that this was going to be an absolutely awesome movie. After seeing the inferior 1998 version that for some reason I watched several times, I was anxiously waiting for a good remake. This 123 minute slice of awesome completely made up for my long time of waiting. There were two things I was looking for that this movie did not have, however. The original theme from 1954 and the original roar. I was not dissatisfied with the new roar, though, and it was so cool it gave me goosebumps the first time I heard it. I did still miss the original music, but I do understand copyright laws. People keep ripping on this awesome movie because it didn't offer anything new. I think it offered some new material, like the look of Godzilla and his roar and the monsters he fights. The makers of the movie changed a lot of the small things about the appearance of Godzilla, but kept the main things. For example, they kept his menacing behavior, his sky scraping height, and his incomprehensible strength. I think Edwards did an awesome job making this movie. He made sure not to completely copy off of Japan's Gojira, but made sure to keep it similar enough so the die-hard Godzilla fans were not unhappy. One of the reasons the 1998 Godzilla was not very successful was because Roland Emmerich completely changed the appearance of the so-called Godzilla to where it just looked like a giant T-Rex. Sort of. But Edwards kept the main shape of Godzilla so that was good. I guess I should actually review the general aspects of the movie. The actors were mostly A+ stars talking B+ dialogue, but it didn't bother me that much at all, because I'm not a huge stickler. Although there were some really good quotes throughout, and that kind of made up for it. The special effects were mind blowing. I'm surprised the budget was still only $160,000,000 with how good the special effects were. With three monsters, I would have expected it to be over $200,000,000 easily. The story was moderately original, and offered some new ideas and some already used ideas. However, if you just want to see a movie on a Saturday night, this will not bother you at all, and you should enjoy the movie as it is. Edwards' directing style is great, and makes you feel like you might be in a nearby helicopter or plane watching all of the action unfold, which is a lot better than just a completely still camera sitting on a bridge. He (Edwards) also did a good job putting in some minor characters to emphasize the importance of people during some of the fight scenes, like a bus driver. Overall, this is a solid installment in the Godzilla franchise, and will be much more successful, remembered, and liked than the 1998 Godzilla ever was. Thanks for reading. See ya!"
"caroeb","3","15","31","23 May 2014"," Anti-climatic
","I went to this movie to see Godzilla, and I hardly ever saw him. When I did see him, he looked clumsy and facially not as attractive as previous incarnations. That and an anti- climax spoiled the movie for me, in spite of some good 3D effects.<br/><br/>I was annoyed by several cuts of scenes that caused me to wonder, ""what just happened??"" Also, the spoof of 1950's flicks doesn't quite come off.<br/><br/>What will stand out in my mind will be the 3 forces of nature battling it out (briefly) oblivious to the smashed city under their feet. Maybe that will be worth it to you."

","This American version is 100 times better for the 1998 flop!

He is a bit fatter and larger but he is more true to the TOHO Godzilla then ""zilla"". Finally someone has gotten it right. There are a few times I jumped and teared up.

","A dull film by Gareth Edwards, ""Godzilla"" opens in 1954, with the United States dropping an atomic bomb on a mysterious sea-creature. We then leap ahead fifty years. Here nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) witnesses the death of his wife (Juliette Binoche). This phony dramatic moment is hastily brushed aside in favour of yet another flash-forward. Here, fifteen years later, scientists, geologists and engineers attempt to ascertain the cause of various seismic anomalies. As Edwards' film is called ""Godzilla"", this is all tedious. We're ten steps ahead of you, Edwards. Get to the point.<br/><br/>But ""Godzilla"" has no point. An exercise in clichés – which Edwards pretentiously attempts to approach from what he thinks are ""fresh"" angles – the film's second half mostly watches as hazily rendered CGI monsters interact with collapsing buildings and lazily written soldiers. Holding this thin plot together is Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor), Joe's son, who is arbitrarily inserted into each of the film's major situations. Throw in offensively underwritten roles (Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen etc), Spielbergian father/son subplots, a tale which sidesteps all politics surrounding nuclear energy/usage, and several dull action sequences (why use bullets when atomic bombs did nothing 60 years prior?), and you have a truly rare beast: a film which makes Roland Emmerich look good.<br/><br/>3/10 – Worth no viewings. For better ""giant monster"" movies, see: ""Pacific Rim"", ""Them!"" (1954), ""War of the Worlds"" (2005), ""Starship Troopers"", ""The Mist"" and ""The Host"" (2006)."
"marinaro44","4","7","12","6 November 2014"," A colossal letdown not Godzilla's fault
","Considering what the filmmakers had to work with this movie is a major failure. The special effects are first rate and the visualization of Godzilla is great. Unfortunately you hardly ever get a chance to see him, as he is a minor character in his own movie. Worse yet, almost the entire movie is shot at night in deep shadow. So we don't really get to see the fight scenes between Godzilla and the other creatures. Mostly you see just quick glimpses of these massive things in the dark. So as a creature feature the movie is unimpressive.<br/><br/>Added to that the plot is inane, with the usual stupid behavior of our military ""brain trust"" depicted at every turn. Obviously the filmmakers assumed viewers would check their intelligence at the front door of the theater, so no need to care about logic or realism.<br/><br/>The acting is second rate so that doesn't help the movie's entertainment value either. The lead actor is totally forgettable.<br/><br/>Finally, and worst of all, there is no viewer emotional involvement with the characters or the creatures. We should care for Godzilla, and he could have been portrayed as a hero in this film, but since he is a bit player for most of the movie we just don't care. In the climactic ending we get our first impressive views of what Godzilla looks like and his impressive powers, but it is too little too late.<br/><br/>BTW, when watching the special features I became even more disappointed as you get some views of what the movie could have at least looked like. Here you get to see the creatures fighting in the light without all of the murky filtering applied. Too bad. Someone needs to follow up this movie with a sequel to cleanse the bad taste it leaves for lovers of Godzilla."
"bob-the-movie-man","5","7","12","29 May 2014"," Mildly diverting.... but leave brain at the door
","A terrifying creature is approaching the coast and Brody – half crazed with fear and loss – is trying to convince sceptical authorities of the impending disaster without success. And what a great 5* film Jaws was! Godzilla on the other hand It's not as if the film is absolutely terrible. As an example of the genre of dumb-arsed, popcorn-munching summer blockbusters, it has its diverting moments. Certainly if you get turned on my giant dinosaurs fighting each other and smashing up San Francisco, this is definitely the film for you. But it's not going to set the awards season alight, in just about any category as far as I can see.<br/><br/>It starts promisingly enough, with a Jurassic Park-style helicopter ride over lush Philippine jungle to a Raiders of the Lost Ark-style dig where some Alien-style eggs have been discovered. So far, so plagerised. The ever reliable Ken Watanabe (probably hired solely for the way he pronounces ""Godzilla"") plays the investigating scientist with his rather unlikely side-kick Sally Hawkins ('Blue Jasmine').<br/><br/>The action then moves to one of the best segments of the film in Japan where nuclear plant boss Brody (Snr), played by Malcolm in the Middle / Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston, has to contend with the tragic consequences of what has been disturbed.<br/><br/>We then skip 15 years forwards to where explosives expert Ford Brody (Jnr) (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of Kick-Ass fame) has to leave his young family in San Francisco to fly to Japan to bail out his dad from jail. (Yes, I couldn't work that one out either doesn't Japan do Paypal?). The basic premise here is that Godzilla is the good guy in the picture (even though the Americans seem to want to try and shoot him at every opportunity) helping to ""restore balance"" to the prehistoric world by defeating the horny preying-mantis-like monsters (aka MUTOs) before they can have rumpy-pumpy and make thousands of other preying-mantis like monsters, so returning ""man to the stone age"". Much mayhem and destruction naturally follows, showing once again (""Man of Steel"", ""Avengers Assemble"", etc, etc) that the US economic recovery is based solely on jobs for builders, decorators and glaziers.<br/><br/>In the acting stakes, Taylor-Johnson is very good (channelling a brooding Jake Gyllenhaal look) but Cranston seems rather over the top. It is also a very sexist films, with the female leads being given scandalously little to do: Elizabeth Olsen (looking wonderfully un-skinny and gorgeous in a non-Hollywood sort of way) is confined to running and screaming and the wonderful Sally Hawkins has even less to do, confined to being Watanabe's bag-carrier for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>Where I could get very critical is in the nonsensical story. Leaving aside the scientific problems I have with ""radioactive levels reducing"" due to ""catalysation"" (whatever that means), the story plays fast and loose with the concept of the MUTOs feeding on radioactive materials. In one scene, a MUTO leaves the main US stockpile of radioactive waste voluntarily, but is supposed to be 'lured out to sea' by a single nuclear warhead. Like, WHAT? And why the US army would try to transport said 'bait' through the enemy territory by train rather than fly it out is bizarre. The story is also strong on Watanabe's claim that letting Godzilla duke it out with the MUTOs is the way forwards, and yet there are at least two occasions when Godzilla and one or more of the MUTOs are together, and yet nothing seems to come of that confrontation. The story just moves on to another pursuit of monster vs monster. Like, WHAT? Very unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>In other departments, the special effects are passable if not outstanding, but there are some memorably cinematic scenes: notably the free-fall parachuting into San Francisco set to Ligeti's music (as used in 2001: A Space Odyssey), which is impressive. And the rest of the music by the omnipresent Alexandre Duplat is also noteworthy (no pun intended). Relative newcomer Gareth Edwards directs, and clearly made an impact as Disney have just given him a Star Wars spin-off film to direct.<br/><br/>A decent early salvo for the summer blockbuster season, but (unlike Godzilla and the MUTOs), unlikely to set the world alight.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!)"

","I wouldn't know where to start, so I'll just start typing... Godzilla(2014) is terrible from the start. By erecting pointless character's driven to meaningless climaxes. It's as if the Studio and Production Team had a meeting about how to turn a great creature feature like Godzilla, and redeem it from the 1998 garbage Director Roland Emmorich shat out. So they sat around, ordered some pf changs, and couldn't think of crap. ""We need some inspiration, fellas!"" Says director Gareth Edwards, so instead of popping in GODZILLA(1954), he pops in CLOVERFIELD into the DVD player. They watched the entire film attentively. ""Well now that's what our viewers WANT! Lots of deep, guttural brass noises and shaky bass. ""And tails! And glimpses of monster feet and tails, sir!"" Says the Assistand Director. ""I think we need more inspiration, though..."" The director says. So he pops in BATTLEFIELD: LOS ANGELES. Because that's what we need. More MILITARY! And CHARACTERS! More characters not to care about!!! Let's bring in that great actor from Breaking Bad, pair him up with that lifeless nerd from Kickass. Oh, and squidward as the navy general and that Japanese guy from Last Samurai who literally just gives us this deep, confused stare off-frame the entire f*cking movie. I'm serious! Watch the movie, and watch EVERY scene Ken Watanabe and you'll laugh. I need to do like a montage or something of all his scenes staring off camera with his mouth open and his eyes all shaky. <br/><br/>I could continue but I don't want to.

","Boy looking at the other IMDb reviews, this seems to have really annoyed an awful lot of people.<br/><br/>Two comments: * I have argued here in the IMDb that the 1998 version with Broderick was under-rated. Vindication at last. As you slog through this version, you cannot help but recall how the 1998 film actually held interest from scene to scene, and seemed to want to go somewhere.<br/><br/>* a cautionary tale on the importance of -- who knew? -- a script. The really strange thing is that the production standards, the effects, the cinematography, are all pretty solid. All dressed up and nowhere to go.

"spyroskonst","3","12","24","23 August 2014"," Disappointing in almost everything.
","This is a film someone is going to see for the CGI, we already know that. <br/><br/>Thing is, it fails in everything else! No character plot, no story, but most importantly Godzilla appears only 15-20min in total of 2:30hour movie, and with interrupted short fights! It kinda reminded me of Dark Knight Rises and Superman Returns, where you only have about 10-15min (at best) fight scenes. Finally when the fight starts with the two bugs, it is continuously interrupted by US soldiers trying to do their stuff. I did not pay to see US soldiers, but Godzilla!<br/><br/>Looking for a story? Well, the excuse of a new Godzilla movie is that Godzilla ""must restore balance to nature, that's why he must kill the two bugs"". Real movie dialogue! Go figure. At least in the 1998 movie it wanted to reproduce, that's why it surfaced. We had a reason for its appearance.<br/><br/>Overall, please ignore this insult to the Godzilla movie history. Still my best movie is the 1998, and i really do not know why reviews bury it. Prefer the original 1960's Japanese movies. They are so much better than this, and Godzilla fights much more, with extended screen time appearance."

","So they put a big huge fight scene of what looked like a big dog and a mosquito..The whole rest of the movie was terrible. The movie seemed to promise action in the trailers, but instead the whole movie was based on boring scenes with boring acting and too much crying. The wife's acting was not convincing and there was no interest in her character. The story is not developed at all and by some miracle they are able to discard a nuclear bomb within 5 minutes and he magically finds his wife amidst all the destruction caused by the monsters. Something that I looked forward to, but next time I see a movie with these actors, I will be sure to think twice before wasting more money. Huge waste of time and money.

","The facts we learned about Godzilla from the most recent movie: 1.

Godzilla is now an elderly gentleman who needs a nap after a battle and before going on for a few final laps in the pool (ocean) The facts we learned about movie-making: 1. It's a BAD idea to kill off your A list cast that people relate to just to set up a background story for your B list lead with zero charisma that no one gives a damn about 2. When making a monster movie give us more than 15 minutes of that monster so we can at least root for Godzilla since there's no (relatable) human element therein"

"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","14","29","14 May 2014"," Uh, folks, we're experiencing some moderate Godzilla-related turbulence...
","After the pretty-much-universally-panned Matthew Broderick movie, which featured basically just a giant iguana running amok, a proper version was sorely needed. Trailers for this new film looked promising, especially the halo jump sequence (which is still one of the best bits of the movie). With expectations so high, there was bound to be slight disappointment. However, the good news is that this movie succeeds where the last one failed miserably. First, and most importantly, this Godzilla actually LOOKS like Godzilla. All the most important parts of what make him iconic are present here, including his roar/scream, 'atomic breath' and arse-kicking of other monsters. After a somewhat eerie opening, shot old-style (with, thankfully, not an iguana in sight), we jump ahead, focusing on Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody, his wife and their son. This section of the film is rather slow/plodding, though obviously it sets things up. We then jump ahead again 15 years and his son, Ford, is now Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is married to Elle, played by Elizabeth Olsen. Is it weird that they'll be playing brother and sister in Avengers 2? Maybe, but here they are a loving husband and wife and have a kid of their own. I know Bryan Cranston has his many fans, and he makes the most of his role, but the film doesn't actually get going until after his exit and we are introduced to a creature that looks somewhat like the monster from Cloverfield, called a M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Things quickly pick up and the action begins, as we get not just one, but TWO of these spindly-legged nasties. When the big guy eventually turns up to show these punk-arse Mutos who is the King of the Monsters, it's a glorious moment.<br/><br/>Taylor-Johnson's Ford is a likable enough lead. He does some reuniting- a-kid-with-his parents here, a little toasting of the Muto's spawn there, but he's just a guy who happens to get into the thick of it and does the best he can given the circumstances. Elizabeth Olsen is also good as Elle. She doesn't get to do a whole lot, but she's infinitely better/more likable than any of the female characters in the last movie. She and Taylor-Johnson make a good pair, who you won't come to hate, thankfully. Even the kids in this movie aren't too loathsome (which is quite surprising, given what these types of movies are usually like). The movie is pretty devoid of humour, but there is one amusing moment involving Elle telling her kid to turn off the television when, unbeknown to her, an epic fight is going down on the TV between Godzilla and a Muto. It's probably for the best that this film has a more 'serious' tone and that there's not many 'jokes', especially given the alternative (ie. the last film). Our other main protagonist is Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, played by Ken Watanabe. He does plenty of staring off into the distance and such, but one important thing he does bring to the film is the fact that he knows what we all already know: Godzilla is an *asset* when it comes to fighting other monsters. Serizawa, unlike everyone else, realises it's probably a good idea to sic the big guy onto the Mutos rather than focusing on trying to take him out along with them. And he's right too, of course.<br/><br/>When it comes to the smackdown, Godzilla shows who's boss. Yes, there's a couple of moments where we think he's done for (and you certainly feel for the big guy), but in the end he proves why he is indeed the King of all monsters (his blue flaming kiss o' death is a particularly nice move). There might not be quite as much fighting between the monsters as some may hope, but what we do see is pretty awesome. You do get quite a few good looks at Godzilla, but he's not over-shown. Best of all? Everyone acknowledges at the end that he is indeed the saviour of the city, he doesn't die and he's allowed to return to his life under the sea. The score is quite appropriate for this monster movie, although it might have benefited from having the 'ROAR!' (Cloverfield Overture) which Michael Giacchino wrote as an homage to Japanese monster scores for the film Cloverfield. The music during that movie's end credits was epic. This film's? Slightly less so, though not at all 'bad'. Director, Gareth Edwards, who gave us that little gem of a movie called Monsters, proves he's in his element when dealing with said creatures. He's definitely the guy best suited to staying faithful to the legend that is Godzilla and bringing him to the screen in all his glory. Hail to the King of Monsters! Now all we have to worry about is Mothra...but hopefully he's tied up with Gamera and Rodan at the present time."
"DukeMaxwell","8","14","29","14 May 2014"," Great movie, Godzilla is back to his roots
","To me it was pretty awesome; Godzilla is more or less back to the way he looked in the Toho movies, which I really liked. He gets teased for quite a while with only showing the spikes on his back or a foot, while watching I hated it but for all the right reasons, it builds up tension till he is finally revealed and it was glorious. The humans were good, but not outstanding, which is a plus if you ask me. If I compare it to Transformers, where you also have a secondary human cast, it is handled way better because it doesn't feel tacked on as much and for me it didn't steal the show from the monsters. Another point I really liked was the fact that they incorporated the cautionary aspect of the original Godzilla, regarding nuclear weapons/energy but modified it a bit and lifted it from the 50's to present day; I am not going to go into more detail about this as not to spoil the movie. Lastly, two negative points, which might be nitpicking but still it needs to be said. Firstly, the 3D, while the animation was top notch on the monsters and for the most part the CGI worked well and was nicely integrated, why on Earth would you opt for what I call ambient 3D. It's basically the 3D you saw in Avatar, it looks great and gives you great depth perception, but a movie like Godzilla really lends itself to the more ""all-out"" effects á la Drive angry. I wanted to see sh*t flying into my face when Godzilla wrecks a building, I wanted to flinch when he whips his tail in my direction. The other slightly negative point is regarding the monster fight scenes, some of the lacked impact for me. I could forgive that on the old rubber suits you couldn't easily make Godzilla bleed or see his scales scratched and torn, but in 2014 I expect a bit from Godzilla to at least leave behind some kind of mark or scratch. In all fairness, I have to mention that this is not true for all the scenes and it didn't impact me that much, but I noticed it and others did too. Overall, I really enjoyed watching this film and recommend seeing it in theaters if only to hear Godzilla's epic roar on their sounds system. As for a numerical score I give Godzilla a very solid 8 out of 10, it's not a must see but if you like monster movies or even just want to watch a popcorn flick, you won't be disappointed."
"NightGaunt75","3","6","10","30 January 2016"," Could have been a contender...
","So I just watched this movie for the second time, and had to review it.<br/><br/>I've seen various complaints about this film, and although I tend to agree with a number of them, as a G-fan, I can accept most of the shortcomings.<br/><br/>""He's too fat."" - Godzilla's weight has fluctuated dramatically over the last 60 years and 28 movies, and although he is chubbier in this than any other suit, I can go with it. Mostly because I really, REALLY like the head sculpt (I know its CGI, but its CGI designed to look like a guy in a rubber suit).<br/><br/>""He was only in 20 minutes of the movie."" - Yep. Should have been more Godzilla in a Godzilla movie. But part of that, I think, is the fact that it was just too damn long. Way too much peripheral crap that didn't really add much. However, I understand that's Edwards' thing (highlighting the human drama and using the creatures as background), and again, I can accept that.<br/><br/>""The MUTOs were lame/stupid/unimaginative."" - Meh. Can't really say they were any lamer than Baragon or King Caesar, and Mothra really wasn't the height of imagination either. Still, these are antagonists that we love. So I can easily accept the MUTOs into the pantheon of Godzilla foes, though they should have had names instead of acronyms.<br/><br/>""The story was crap/The characters were one-dimensional/I can pick out xxx things that were ridiculous."" - yeah, there were a lot of dumb things in the story. No point in going through them all, I don't have space. But again, it's a Godzilla movie. No one should be going to see this for anything other than the title character. Anyone who wants to nitpick this obviously hasn't watched 'Godzilla vs. Megalon' in its full glory.<br/><br/>""Its way better than the 1998 version."" - Duh. That wasn't a Godzilla movie, that was a monster movie. Hell, other than his uncharacteristic luck with Stargate, anything with Roland Emmerich involved is probably going to be pretty stupid anyway.<br/><br/>""It had an Olsen sister and the Kick-Ass guy in it."" - yeah, it did. Certainly not a big enough issue to pan the film, at least for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, those are the biggies, and if they were all, I could easily have given this movie a 7 - it WAS entertaining after all. Unfortunately, my biggest issue is one that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere (though I could have just missed it): Legendary/WB/Edwards didn't use Godzilla's roar. Let me say that again... THEY DIDN'T USE THE ROAR. One of the most iconic sound effects in movie history, and they failed to use it. Unforgivable, and a game-changer, at least for me.<br/><br/>It may seem like a small detail, but think about the reaction to a Star Wars movie that had Darth Vader without James Earl Jones' voice. Total fail. And that's exactly what happened here."
"chloe_rules123","5","6","10","2 April 2015"," It's a good looking film, but unfortunately lacks a plot.
","Just finished the film and well... it was really unimpressive. I was expecting it to be great! It seems to start well but literally in the first 5 minutes you're brought into the middle of a family's life and expected to care about them. Admitted Bryan Cranston gave a fantastic performance (as always!) but the writing just wasn't that good. There wasn't any reason for us to worry about what would become of these characters because, well, no one gave us a reason. I couldn't tell you either parent's name without looking it up. I only know Ford's because I just saw it on the cast/character list when scrolling. It kind of felt like someone had smushed a story around several lengthy Godzilla battles... which looked awesome I have to say (although got repetitive very quickly), but it took away even more from the characters we're supposed to be rooting for, which was a shame. I wanted to care, a great bloody disaster was unfolding for crying out loud, but it just didn't work.<br/><br/>I saw Monsters, Gareth Edwards' seriously low budget monster movie, which I really enjoyed. The story seemed original, the characters were believable and the special effects brilliant. Then you hear it was edited by just a handful of people in hotel rooms during filming. Unfortunately I didn't see this brilliant film-making I had been hoping to see much in Godzilla. It was there, but only briefly.<br/><br/>It was good to watch, but only that I'm afraid. It's pretty but lacking everywhere else."
"worley74","1","19","42","15 May 2014"," Terrible
","My first thoughts on seeing a trailer for this movie was ""Well, here comes another terrible movie remake."" I couldn't have been more right.

NOPE, you get maybe 20 minutes of the ""Zilla"" and the rest is bad acting and mouth breathing as they stare at the camera.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting the worst, and it delivered.

"rbaddy","2","9","17","19 May 2014"," Stunningly bad
","I walked into the theater hopeful and walked out feeling like I had been robbed of $11.50.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest problem is that no one acts like they are in a Godzilla movie. Instead, the performances would fit just as neatly in a regular action flick. The only character who really acts as if the kaiju are an existential threat to mankind is Joe Brody. The film starts out hinting that it will be a serious character-drive story, making Joe Brody the main character on a scientific and perhaps spiritual journey that gives him a greater appreciation of nature, existence, and reality. But instead, they kill him off.<br/><br/>We're left with Ford, Elle, and Sam Brody. The Ford Brody character is so stilted and wooden that his non-reaction to everything that was happening to him and around him just made me laugh. His dad dies after uncovering a huge secret, monsters rampage across the Earth, he is almost killed several times, and he's completely stoic and brave about the whole thing. A human being would not react to such things that way. Poor Elle and Sam - relegated to near-silence as they serve as Ford's motivation. <br/><br/>The plot starts off well enough: A massive cover-up has been going on for decades. First, Godzilla was roused from the depths and we tried to kill him with nukes. Then, when the energy-sucking kaiju first appeared, it was explained away as a natural disaster.<br/><br/>Then, the Tokyo kaiju, called MUTO by the military, heads out to Hawaii, and that's where the story seriously goes off the rails. Ford Brody just happens to be directly in the MUTO's path not only in Tokyo but again in Hawaii, and has to save himself and some random kid on a airport train that is attacked. That was when I started wondering: Were they really going to put Ford Brody, a Navy lieutenant, in the monsters' way the whole movie? Unfortunately, yes.<br/><br/>The MUTO destroys Honolulu, and the government decides the charade is over, the cover-up must end. And so the news goes out on TV, and the military tracks the MUTO and Godzilla as they head to the US west coast. With many hours of advance notice, do the authorities evacuate the west coast? Nope. Do they even try to get people away from sources of nuclear radiation? Nope. That would spoil the ""Elle and Sam in peril"" plot point. During the San Francisco fight, we even see the male MUTO fly past an office building with people still working at their desks as if nothing were going on up until that moment.<br/><br/>It turns out a second MUTO, the female, is in Yucca Mountain in Nevada. We get treated to a suspenseful breaching of the nuclear waste facility by a military team - who discover that the female MUTO has busted out of the side of mountain and headed off to a romantic rendezvous with her mate in San Francisco, knocking down much of Vegas along the way. This part produced unintentional laughter, too: Did the military not fly over the place in helicopters before going in? Did they just miss the gigantic hole in the mountain?<br/><br/>Then we get the attempt to lure the monsters out to sea off of San Francisco with a nuclear missile and then detonate it 20 miles from the coast, killing them all. When asked why it will work when the bombs in the 50s didn't, they say the new ones are much, much bigger, and the blast will kill anything. The problem here is one of theme of the movie. Dr. Serizawa speaks the line that is supposed to be the intellectual center of the movie, ""The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in their control and not the other way around."" In other words, what people do in this situation is irrelevant. And for much of the movie, that's the case. Nothing the humans do affects the behavior of the monsters in any way that gives the humans control, up until this point. But now Serizawa acts as if the nuke could actually kill Godzilla, which totally undermines the point. What would have made more sense is for the nuke to go off, and for the kaiju to go on fighting Godzilla as if nothing had happened. That would have allowed a moment to see real terror on the faces of the humans as they finally realized they were completely helpless to affect the outcome of events.<br/><br/>During the surprisingly slow-paced monster fight, Ford Brody once again is in the thick of the action, both setting fire to MUTO embryos and trying to get the nuke disarmed or out of the city. At one point, a MUTO is going to kill Brody, and he pulls out ... his pistol. With a completely serious expression on his face, he aims it at the MUTO. I literally did a facepalm at that moment. But Godzilla saves him, and in the movie's most excruciating moment, makes eye contact with Ford Brody and appears to give him a smile before being swallowed up in a cloud of dust and smoke. This was unbearably stupid. <br/><br/>Now Ford Brady sends the nuke out to sea (not the planned 20 miles - he is on some small navy vessel, with only 5 minutes on the timer, so it's at most going to be 3 miles from shore, and you'd expect the devastation of S.F. as a result, but we're not even playing by the internal rules of the movie anymore, much less actual physics). Then Brody gets rescued, Elle and Sam are safe, and Godzilla comes back to life and jumps into the sea over a TV graphic of ""city's savior"". Cue the sequel! But I'll catch the next one when it comes out on streaming video."

","What's Good: Back-story to some extend,bits and pieces of action sequences. What's Not: Everything else is purely illogical and BAD.<br/><br/>I happen to catch the screening of the new GODZILLA movie. I loved the previous GODZILLA movie by Ronald Emmerich which was released in 1998. I was truly excited about this flick and it turned out to be total DUD. To start with, a nuclear test are performed at JAPAN to observe the magnitude of the test. It somehow gives a more than life shape to a chameleon which turns out to be a GODZILLA. According to the Japanese sayings its a creature made by GOD but so they somehow allow that large creature to stay in the ocean (Arrgh). After many years an American engineer Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston-Breaking Bad fame) is working on a project and suddenly their power plant ends up getting quakes which ends up in a total mishap and broken family. Now Joe is looking out for answers for 15 years. His son Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is in defense and plans to meet his dad to get back in life and they end up noticing the real reason for the mishap created 15 years ago. A new creature is born ""MUTO""-Mutant Unidentified Terrestrial Organism which looks like Large Mantis who feeds only on radiation. Anything that contains radiation is his food (Arrghh again) and now its not one but TWO large mantis. Now the female MUTO wants to deliver her babies requires radiation. So to stop these MUTO's the humans think of bringing in GODZILLA, and you guys can guess how it's going to end.<br/><br/>So what do we see here, fight between GODZILLA and two MUTO's which sound fine but unfortunately they don't show the fight completely. C'mon they made up the situation to arrive at this point and no BIG fight. Also to mention the run-time of the movie is 2.5 hours and GODZILLA appears on screen for hardly 20 mins (KIDDING ME). Then why make a movie on GODZILLA?? coz the rest of the time they are just trying to give explanations which is purely BULLSHIT.<br/><br/>I invested money to see the large creature and also the huge fight. NOTHING comes your way. It's purely waste of money and time.PURELY NON-RECOMMENDED."
"MediaPanther","7","9","17","15 May 2014"," A marvel to experience
","When it comes to iconic movie monsters, few others can come close to the King of the Monsters himself, Godzilla. Director Gareth Edward's 2014 Godzilla film is the second time that an American studio has taken the reigns in an attempt to bring Japan's most famous kaiju to the big screen. Its predecessor in 1998 met mixed to negative reviews, but this update pays homage to the original 1954 Japanese film while at the same time modernizing the tale for a new audience.<br/><br/>The film follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a lieutenant in the United States Navy who specializes in disposing of explosive ordinances. Ford's parents, Joe (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra (Juliette Binoche) work in a Japanese nuclear plant when a terrible accident occurred in 1999. Fifteen years later, Joe is a conspiracy theorist on the search for truth when he is arrested for trespassing on the remains of his old house, now a quarantine zone. Joe believes that it was not a natural disaster that took his wife, but some kind of creature that the government is trying to cover up. Now, believing that history is repeating itself, he embarks on a search for his old data, dragging his son along with him.<br/><br/>While the plot of Godzilla is told from the perspective of Lt. Brody, everyone knows who the real star of the film is and the director took great care in portraying the monster in a positive light. The real threat to humanity in the film are two giant, insect-like monsters, called M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) who are attempting to meet and reproduce. The beast known as Godzilla is described by resident monster expert, Dr. Serazawa (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samuri) as a prehistoric animal who is ""nature's power to restore balance."" The director spends a great deal of time in the first act of the movie teasing the audience with the scaly hero, and it was a smart decision to build the tension and anticipation before revealing the beloved monster in a roaring crescendo of excitement.<br/><br/>The human story in Godzilla is necessary and while not the most gripping, it remains entertaining enough that it doesn't seem to hurt the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) is the film's protagonist and the audience watches the story unfold from his perspective. Viewers will be able to get behind the Navy Lieutenant desperately trying to get back to his family and protect them, and also playing his part to save the world. Taylor-Johnson's performance, however, was rather thin and could have benefited from more emoting as opposed to the serious, blank stare he wears for the majority of the film. Conversely, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) really steals the show as Taylor-Johnson's eccentric father digging for the truth. He shows so much emotion in his time in the film, that it's a shame that his screen time is cut rather short. Ken Watanabe is great in his role and conveys a sense of respect for the titular monster. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, spends almost the entire film worrying about the safety of her husband and son, but not much else.<br/><br/>Edwards' decision to portray the monsters as animals fighting for their own survival helped keep an otherwise fantastical film somewhat grounded in reality. In addition to the breathtaking visuals, the score by Alexandre Desplat is beautiful, perfectly pulling emotion from the audience. Technically speaking, Godzilla as a film is a marvel to look at, hear, and experience.<br/><br/>-Oliver Pascual www.mediumraretv.org"

The design is awesome, he looks like Godzilla and also acts like Godzilla! He isn't in the movie for long though.<br/><br/>The MUTO creatures are original and amazing! The flying MUTO is scary and deadly. The normal MUTO is strong and horrifying. The designs are very original and pretty scary.<br/><br/>The CGI is awesome! The animation on the creatures are very realistic and believable.<br/><br/>The music is great, it's loud and intense, just like the movie. <br/><br/>The acting is great but Aaron Taylor Johnson can be emotionless but can be excused cause he's a soldier.<br/><br/>The monster battles are incredible and intense! The best part is where Godzilla grabs the MUTOs jaw (King Kong style) he breaths his atomic breath down the MUTOs throat, melting it's body and neck, then Godzilla holds the severed head of the creature in his victory!<br/><br/>Overall: awesome music, great acting and incredible monster battles and FX.

"SugarandIce","8","13","27","17 May 2014"," Gareth Edwards captures the magic of the original film.
","Of all 2014's films, Godzilla was my most anticipated. In some ways, it let me down. In most, it satisfied me.<br/><br/>Let me first speak of the cons. For all this film's darkness, its ""infant immortality"" shows it's not quite as gritty as the classic film. I also was disappointed Godzilla did not return to his villainous roots. Finally, the characters and their stories were not as interesting as they ought to have been.<br/><br/>The pros far outweigh the cons though. Gareth Edwards loves his monsters and it shows. He treats the kaiju with respect. Godzilla and the MUTO are well-designed, have great roars, behaviors, and flawless CGI. The movie utilizes buildup and suspense to bring a climax that pays off massively. The film also has a constant dark atmosphere, that never once crosses into cheese. Every angle in this film is masterfully shot, end of story. Bryan Cranston's performance was breathtaking and scenes with him have the most emotion and heart. While the character stories did not pay off, the characters (and the acting) all sufficed. While short of a masterpiece, this is one of the best monster movies you will ever see."

The way it swims, walks and roars are perfectly designed. The only flaw from this reboot is, the movie lacks in humanity side. It shows more damages buildings and roads that is caused by monsters than how many innocent people was sacrificed from the tragedy itself. Also Ford Brody character is too heroic though. Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a serious yet ambitious film-making and a reboot that is needed. It pays all the mistake Roland Emmerich had done years ago with much upgrades at visual and significantly more logical issue in storyline. Aside of some weaknesses, ""Godzilla"" is probably the most stunning and entertaining movie so far this year also great experience to see it at IMAX theater."

","I am shocked by all the positive reviews for this disaster. It's nothing more than a compilation of a handful of other film story lines built around a 1950s era creature feature. There are dozens of continuity errors including the size of the monsters. For example, compared to the Golden Gate Bridge, Godzilla is about 40 feet tall. In the next scene, he towers above skyscrapers. Additionally, he is walking in the bay and the water is up to his ankles. Then he dives into the same water and disappears. I can't believe this film got distributed but I guess there are suckers born every minute. Save your money and see this on premium cable."

","The first time I saw the trailers I was really impressed and looked forward to this movie. Finally, I watched it yesterday and I have to say that it was a huge disappointment. The makers have have successfully cheated the audience who come to watch Godzilla. Godzilla roughly appears in 5-6 scenes.<br/><br/>I had to keep myself awake in the first hour of the movie because it was really boring. The movie was not about the Gozdilla but those other robotic monsters.<br/><br/>Final word; Don't waste your money on this movie. Spend the money on something else instead."

","SOME SPOILERS! WARNING! I usually don't write reviews but after watching Godzilla I just had to! This film is so epic and breathtaking, the action sequences are awesome, the MUTO creatures are very well designed and the entire cast delivers good performances. This film is much, much better than Transformers and Pacific Rim (which was a very good movie). If you want to see a fun and dark monster film, then is the the right one for you but if you're looking for a movie with monsters and action from beginning to end then you will be disappointed, they really build the story with some character development (not many) and intense and emotional scenes one which includes Bryan Cranston that was totally unexpected to end with an epic battle. I really hope this film does well in the box office because I want a sequel! <br/><br/>I've read other reviews and I don't know why people complain that there were too few Godzilla scenes and that it takes almost an hour to finally see him. In my opinion that was one of the things that made this film so good, they tease you for one hour and when they finally show him, is absolutely amazing, Godzilla really looks terrifying . I'm looking forward to see more films by Gareth Edwards, he has delivered a true masterpiece and a film not to be missed this summer! Just go and see it.<br/><br/>P.S. Godzilla uses his Atomic Roar! EPIC!"

","Godzilla is another attempt by Hollywood to revive the giant after Roland Emmerich's juvenile version in 1998. In a more pragmatic depiction, scientific experiments gone awry lead to menacing monsters being unleashed. These beasts are pitted against Godzilla, leaving the fate of humans in the balance.<br/><br/>The latest Japanese gem to be reworked following success stories like The Ring and The Grudge, Godzilla represents a chance to resurrect the leviathan. The opportunity lies in the capable hands of Gareth Edwards. First and foremost, in his primary foray into blockbuster territory, Edwards excels in doing justice to the titular character.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a force of nature, the biggest ever seen on screen, dwarfing many skyscrapers and laying waste to his surroundings. The belligerent behemoth's appearance and movement are a sight to behold. Furthermore, his iconic roar and colossal scales, exhibited by employing extensive CGI, complete his sinister look.<br/><br/>The director clearly prefers building anticipation rather than front loaded action. His attempt at creating anticipation and a sense of awe is akin to classics such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, where the creature lurks ominously but still makes its presence felt. However, the director does entice the viewer with fleeting glimpses and references throughout.<br/><br/>Also at his disposal is a coterie of enormous talent, such as veterans Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and also emerging actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. The human characters are used as the focal point of the action. The makers place great value in establishing a sentimental element in the midst of all the decimation. Bryan Cranston is particularly effective as the doom monger and delivers the most compelling human interaction sequences.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the highlight of the movie is that Godzilla is on a collision course with other monsters. The resulting encounters are worthy of the price of admission alone. Also, the spectacle renders itself well in IMAX screens.<br/><br/>The story also pays homage to Godzilla's roots and legacy as a metaphor for nuclear proliferation. The writer's success lies in creating an aura of plausibility. As opposed to a ludicrous narrative, there is legitimate realism in the story.<br/><br/>The production value of the film also shines through: the cinematography, sound design and score are all executed well to provide a haunting effect. However, flaws do persist in the movie. For instance, the acting is found wanting in particular instances in the absence of the action.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, such failings are few and far between. All in all, Godzilla is a fitting tribute to the King of Monsters."
"lornloxor","8","11","22","14 May 2014"," Godzilla definitely roars
","The neat opening credits set the tone for the movie really well combining old military footage and redacted documents for great effect. This movie's approach is more serious than Pacific Rim's for example but not too much so. Visually the movie is absolutely tremendous. The beautiful cinematography conjures up some jaw dropping scenes and the CGI monsters and the destruction they cause are quite awe-inspiring. The way they dealt with the fighting between the monsters and the soldiers also made sense and really highlighted the enormity of these creatures. I'm glad they set a good part of the monster action at night so the monsters aren't always blasted front and center on the screen so we can use our imaginations to fill in the gaps. When the monsters are truly revealed, it's hard not to get chills at that point. I thought there was just the right amount of Godzilla in the film but for those who expect this to be another Pacific Rim there might be too little of the big guy.<br/><br/>I perhaps wanted more heart from Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford Brody who was a bit generic as the movie's protagonist (though I think that's due to the script because Johnson put in a great performance in Kick-Ass). Bryan Cranston delivered the best performance in this film with great emotion as the nuclear engineer and Ford's dad Joe Brody. They also play well off each other. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife who is also a nurse but we don't really see much of her in that role despite all of the destruction around them. I have no doubt some of her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor but I guess something has to give when you try to get this many characters in and keep the movie at two hours. I also wanted to see more Ken Watanabe, I thought his character was a tad under used. Then again this movie is more about how humanity overall would deal with a situation like this so it's understandable that all of the characters don't quite have the depth we might hope. <br/><br/>Despite some of the underdeveloped characters, I did get really immersed in the movie and had chills in many places. The great sound design and rousing score together with the truly awesome visuals definitely helped there. I was gripped by the movie throughout and the buildup to the showdown in the end was expertly crafted by director Gareth Edwards. If you're looking to have a good time at the movies, Godzilla definitely fits the bill."
"phantoms35","7","11","22","13 May 2014"," A solid entry which takes the franchise back to basics in a whole new way
","Full disclosure: I was given my advanced screening ticket and didn't pay to see the film which may have colored my initial impression. That said...<br/><br/>My first thought on leaving the theater last night was: Good, not great. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie does what it does exceptionally well. There are a lot of very coolly handled transitions which use drastic perspective changes to change scenes and simultaneously handle the larger scope of Godzilla and the smaller scope of the individual characters. I'm still a firm believer, though, that 3d...even IMAX 3d, is the death of cinematography. 3d forces the viewer's perspective to an intended focal point in either the foreground or background, and as a result, everything else loses definition. I can't imagine directors or principal photography groups actually liking this technology and I'm continually surprised at how well received it is.<br/><br/>Sound was well done from an effects perspective. There was absolutely nothing in the way of a score which was disappointing. The only thing that stood out to me thematically from a musical perspective was a drum heavy theme which they overused each time Japan was shown. I'm not certain that there wasn't other music present, but if there was, it was completely forgettable. <br/><br/>In terms of plot, it was a Godzilla movie, so I don't think anyone is going into this expecting an Oscar-worthy screenplay, BUT the trailers set an expectation for me that the movie couldn't match. The acting was nothing special and a little over-the-top in some places. Cranston lent some credibility, but the novelty of his appearance wears off pretty quickly. Unfortunately, this film wasted Ken Wantanabe; I'm a fan of his limited work which I've seen, but he had nothing to work with in this script, and to call his performance wooden is a disservice to trees. AT Johnson is much the same, regrettably. I didn't feel that there was much to connect him to the audience, and instead, he becomes more of a vehicle through which to view the movie's world around him.<br/><br/>Now, considering it is a Godzilla movie, the important part. Is the monster battle epic, and does it hold up? The answer is, like everything with this movie, a little of both yes and no. Personally, I really liked how they handled it. I felt the build-up and pacing made for a weighty climax with decent enough stakes to keep the audience invested. The director toys with you a bit though and teases a lot of the action from the perspective of the characters on the ground. The timing of these cuts serve as morsel after morsel of payoff, but after the third or fourth of these cuts, I started to wonder if the grand scale would ever come. Fortunately, in the end, it did come with 3 or 4 separate scenes giving the epically scaled battle the foreground and a couple welcome surprises that were contrary to some of the pre-release info which was making the rounds. <br/><br/>Is it worth seeing? If you're a fan of the genre, yes. It has some of the campiness and charm of the series while still playing straight within its own construct. To me, this is miles ahead of the travesty that was Godzilla '98, but it lacked some of the cinematic flair and novelty that Cloverfield brought to the genre back in 08. It was way more digestible than Pacific Rim as well which should bode well for better overall audience reception. <br/><br/>I'd go with a strong 7.5 out of 10 with a +/- of about .5 expected after a second viewing."

","I had anticipated this movie for a long time hoping it would blow me away and in three scenes it did. The good which was little: CGI was great in the film and held above standards. The bad: However the acting was terrible. A lot of mushy scenes that didn't need to be there. I felt that Godzilla was extremely ""SOFT"" when it came to the movie. I wanted him to destroy the humans as much as he did the monsters. I just wanted a terrorizing Godzilla not the ""lets save the human race"" type. Movies are too predicated towards love and kids instead of dark evil and better quality. I really enjoyed the fights with the monsters but everything else sucked. The movie starts out OK but still the acting isn't at all what it should be and if the excuse is we'll it's a monster movie than I think the director isn't trying hard enough. I wanted to feel for the characters to make the monster more terrifying and I didn't. I thought the Mutos were more terrifying than Godzilla and that should never happen! I felt like I was watching a commercial in a lot of scenes. Very bland. Like I said acting sucked, too many cheesy moments, of course a big love kiss at the end and reunions. We should of been left with destruction and fear!"
"bluemonday1986","1","18","40","15 May 2014"," Disappointing
","First off, I have been a fan for 20+ years, so I am not just some hater bashing this movie. My biggest problem, is that Godzilla is not ""the savior of the city,"" he is a bringer of destruction and chaos. That is why godzilla was created in the first place, to show repercussions of nuclear power by destroying those who use it. Next, out of a 2 hour movie why was the title character only shown for about 5 total minutes??? The other 2 monsters were shown 10 times as much, and they even looked like the monster from cloverfield. If this was supposed to be a reboot for the series, they could have pleased old fans while attracting new ones by bringing back godzilla the destroyer not the hero, make it like the original, or heck even the 1984 version. The only good things I can think of that were good was the CGI and the presentation of godzilla's atomic breath. But that's about it. Most of the acting was boring and there were such long times I between action sequences that I found myself half falling asleep in the theatre. I can't believe there are so many good reviews on here, I guess most people aren't familiar with the concept of what godzilla stands for. I had such high hopes for this film, and in the end I ended up disappointed.<br/><br/>One final note, Bryan Cranston is a terrific actor and I could watch him in just about anything, but even he couldn't save this one, especially when they kill him 30 minutes in."
"InaneSwine","4","5","8","18 February 2016"," Very disappointing
","I understand that this is a film about Godzilla, and the masses buying their tickets want to see cities and landscapes smashed to a million billion bits. In this respect, Godzilla 2014 delivers outright. But there's no reason we shouldn't get a decent story as well. As soon as we see the eponymous creature, the humanistic side of the film descends into chaos. The characters are one-dimensional, the script is terrible and I can barely remember any dialogue. In addition, I couldn't help but note how intrusive Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack was. Gone is the tense, choral subtlety of the film's trailer and we are instead treated to Hollywood-standard booming orchestral pieces that actually make the monsters less terrifying.<br/><br/>But on a positive note, Godzilla himself was absolutely gorgeous, and Edwards bravely waits almost a full hour to unleash him in one of the best unveilings of any cinematic character of all time. It's mad to think how an entirely digital creation can become the emotional centre of a story. And someone definitely deserves some kind of award for the film's sound design. It's just a shame that Edwards loaded the film with walking clichés, while forgetting to give show-stealer Bryan Cranston anything to do. Very disappointing."
"SlickWellington","3","5","8","5 September 2015"," Disappointing, but better than Broderick ...
","So disappointing in so many ways, even though Godzilla looked awesome!<br/><br/>OK, so right off the bat we get the Bryan Cranston bait-and-switch -- he was in the trailer about as long as he was in the film.<br/><br/>Why follow an interesting actor/character through a film when we can follow Cranston's son who just happens to be a member of the U.S. military because OF COURSE HE IS ... Please, enough with the one- dimensional U.S. military heroes in films. I'm so tired of 1980s franchise fights the U.S. military. It's almost like Transformers vs. the U.S. Military, but it's Godzilla vs. the U.S. military. At least it's better than 1998's Godzilla where Matthew Broderick for some reason can dial a cell phone and call in an air strike by the U.S. military. At least Cranston's son, you know, what's-his-face, runs around in U.S. military gear for the whole movie looking all heroic and U.S. military- esque. U.S. military!!!<br/><br/>I'm alright with the U.S. Military, just get out of our films already, please! <br/><br/>As far as the plot, watch ""Everything Wrong with Godzilla"" on youtube for a rundown of the stupidity running rampant in this script.<br/><br/>My favorite Godzilla was Godzilla 1985, which stars Raymond Burr as a journalist who survived Godzilla's initial attack in 1956 and now, as Godzilla strikes again in 1985, Burr follows the story, keeps us viewers up-to-date and waxes philosophical on the nature of the monster. They think of a clever way to kill Godzilla, and you actually feel sympathy for an incredible creature that is just too dangerous to exist.<br/><br/>This film lacks creativity, substance and any redeeming human characters, which stinks when Godzilla is largely absent from his own film. A big swing and a miss here. I gave it a 3 just because Godzilla didn't asexually give birth to velociraptors in this film, which is a good start toward making a decent Godzilla movie. It doesn't seem like it should be that difficult."

","When you hear the name Godzilla, you usually get a mental image of a guy in a monster suit smashing a model city, and TOHO has had success with that very premise for decades. This Godzilla movie is just like the other franchise ""remakes"" Legendary is notorious for making that include mixing unnecessary loud noises that bust your eardrums, making the film too serious, ""modern artistic vision"", filler etc. the end result is ridiculous! I didn't expect Oscar caliber storytelling or acting, but this was just boring, The pacing was too slow, and I can follow just about any movie but this was difficult, I did however make it to the credits. I had to sit through almost an hour until Godzilla finally made his entrance, right when the first fight starts, it cuts, and we are only shown snippets of it in the form of a news broadcast, and the same way for the rest of the fights WTF?! That'd be like watching the super bowl, with the cameras on the audience 95% of the time! Gareth Edwards said he didn't want to show the monsters fighting, HELLO! isn't Godzilla fighting other monsters the point of watching a Godzilla movie? I don't think the Toho Godzilla franchise would have worked all these years if they'd done it his way. Godzilla himself was very impressive, Thank goodness he wasn't a hermaphroditic lizard monster that ran from the military and got killed with a few missiles. I can deal with his overly bulky build and those elephant feet, but what's up with his roar?!, it sounded muted with too much reverb except for the last part, something clearly went wrong with the mixing, I don't care what the sound editors say. Edwards needs to reconsider the way he's doing this series, because it's only going to get worse if he continues it with snippets of the title monster. I'm not a complainer, I just know what I like. I'll give Godzilla '14 a 4/10 based on Godzilla himself, and minus 6/10 for the nonsense. They said Godzilla would return in 2014...I'm still waiting."

","I usually find user reviews a little harsh as they tend to be overcritical about a film, but, putting aside artistic value, I must say I was disappointed in Godzilla as entertainment. In fact, I found the much-criticized 1998 version much more entertaining. Some of the reviews here were spot on regarding plot and terror level. Too much of the film was made in the dark and there was nothing of special effects that raised my excitement level. I watched Godzilla on DVD, which came with a special features disc and watched some of that to gain some insight. After watching it, I still wondered why the movie was made the way it was, or even better, why bother making it in the first place. As far as monster movies goes, it falls well below the terror level of Jurassic Park and even the 2005 King Kong, which I found to be a beautiful love story. I judge how much I like a movie based on my desire to see it again. Alas, I have no such desire at this point, and don't see it coming in the near future."

","Godzilla is a remake of the 1998 Godzilla film starring Matthew Broderick, which is a remake of the 1956 Godzilla: King of the monsters which itself is a reworking of the 1954 classic Godzilla directed by Ishiro Honda. <br/><br/>Out of the above mentioned films the new Godzilla is definitely better than the 1998 version which was a disappointment upon its release. The new Godzilla goes back to the roots of the iconic monster, taking inspiration from the 1954 film in both its depiction of Godzilla where instead of keeping the story on Godzilla himself it instead brings the focus of the film to the people and how they are affected by the emergence of a giant radioactive lizard, the other throwback being the social commentary about the use of nuclear bomb, which I felt was cleverly updated to feel relevant today.<br/><br/>In the film Brian Cranston plays a scientist who believes that something bad is going to happen as a result of nuclear testing done in Japan, but his theories are dismissed by the scientific world and he is called a 'crackpot' by others. It is only after monsters start appearing that his son (a bomb defuser for the navy seals) played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and others start to believe him, but by this point it is too late and the world has a couple of radio-active monsters to worry about. <br/><br/>The film has a much more grounded take on Godzilla than the past films which is why the story is told through the perspective of the humans and how they plan to overcome the current disaster, which leads to interesting choices in terms of the direction of the film. Speaking of the direction I believe that Gareth Edwards direction is the highlight of the film and saves it from turning into something like Pacific Rim, the scenes in the film are very well constructed and I was particularly impressed by the introduction of Godzilla in a draw dropping shot.<br/><br/>My main issue with the film would be the way Gareth Edwards teased Godzilla in two scenes where the audience believes they were going to see some monster fighting but the scenes just cut away to something less exciting, which I understand goes with the decision to make the film human based, but it does leave the climax underwhelming as it cannot live up to the hype that is previously established. <br/><br/>I do believe that this is probably Godzilla's best American outing but it doesn't live up to the original Ishiro Honda version. This is definitely worth watching as long as you don't go in expecting to see only Godzilla destroying cities."

The teaser and the trailer hyped up many expectations. But upon actually seeing the film, all expectations lowered. The film had so much potential: the monster, the actors, the story. What went wrong with it? Simple: money. This next piece will be a major spoiler so don't read any further if you don't want it spoiled. Bryan Cranston, the highest billed actor for the film (the trailer makes it so that Cranston fights the monster), dies within 25 minutes of the film. If that doesn't help, Godzilla doesn't appear until an hour in. While monster movies have that necessary build-up to show the monster, there are also characters that the audience must care about and be interested in. ""Godzilla"" had the build-up but not the interesting characters. The actors fail to make the audience feel any connection with their respective characters. The action was minimal, at best. The fights were embarrassingly short for a movie about a monster fighting a city. In short, the film was over-hyped and left the audience wanted something better.

","This evening I went to the show and saw Godzilla. The theater had an 80% male population and 20% female population. So much for the demographics. I guess guys like monsters. Now onto the movie.<br/><br/>Having lived through the big screen release of Jurassic Park and T-Rex, who scared the living daylights out of me, I was really looking forward to another OMG moment of closing my eyes out of terror. Unfortunately, I think I only had one ""holy crap"" pop out of my mouth during the entire movie. Perhaps I'm too old to frighten with make-believe monsters. <br/><br/>The movie itself wasn't what I expected. The trailers are pretty spot on setting up the basis for the story. Whatever is down there, it's going to throw us into the stone age again, or so we are led to believe. As it progresses, other monsters emerge who received more screen time than Godzilla. After a while, I felt a bit cheated because I didn't come to see two other creatures get it on and lay eggs. I mean, they're not even that good looking. Sort of leggy, if you ask me, leaping buildings in a single bound. Of course, there's not much left after they leap from rooftop to rooftop.<br/><br/>There were a few odd bits in the storyline, one being the captain of the naval ship who seemed to be calling all the shots and making the big decisions to save the United States. Only once did he get on that important red phone to confer with the President on nuking those nasty building stomping, lay egging monsters. Of course, he didn't listen to the guys who knew what they were talking about, telling him the chosen course of action was a bad one. No surprise there.<br/><br/>As far as gore and blood, you won't see much. I don't think the movie carries the scare factor enough to leave nightmares behind. Of course, the special effects are a far cry from the 1954 version that I grew up with on television. Godzilla looks like the original big body, small headed monster we've always known. Only, you don't cringe when he shows up. In fact, the audience was cheering the big lizard onto victory. Instead of the terror, he is hailed as the ""savior"" of San Francisco. Hum, I think the religious right may balk over that thought.<br/><br/>In any event, it's mildly entertaining. Godzilla sort of sounds like T-Rex, but without the bite. I did not see it in 3D - those progressive lenses I have just ruin the experience for me. The big screen without the 3D was just as much in your face with monsters, falling buildings, and roaring creatures.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an okay remake with the cool new technology we have for film making. No complaints with the actors, they all did a fine job of saving the world and showing that they were at least scared to death over the nuclear eating monsters. San Francisco is a pile of rubble, and Las Vegas will never be the same. Such a shame all those casinos were flattened. Oh, well."

"crimsontercel","9","3","4","12 August 2018"," A Monster Movie that does it Right
","After the disappointment of the '98 Godzilla, you'll naturally have doubts about a new American Godzilla movie. Cast those doubts aside. Godzilla (2014) handles all the monster movie tropes correctly and the result is a great addition to the lineage of the King of the Monsters.<br/><br/>First, nobody's favorite part of a monster movie is watching the humans talk to each other. This movie is no exception, but the characters aren't annoying or nearly as forgettable as other monster movies' humans. Even after Bryan Cranston's character dies, the characters' story remains followable and interesting.<br/><br/>As for the monsters themselves, their roles are handled perfectly. Throughout the film, the monsters' presence is shown very sparingly, giving the creatures the air of mystery that causes you to regard them as titans, not just big things that destroy stuff. They are very rarely shown in their entirety for whole shots until the finale, making their appearances all the more mystical and powerful.<br/><br/>One thing I think is noteworthy is that the film features two monsters that are entirely new to the franchise. These monsters, M.U.T.O.s, are terrifying and interesting. Additionally, they serve as the antagonists, giving Godzilla the role of protector of earth; a role that the uninitiated may not know he frequents.<br/><br/>All in all, Godzilla (2014) is everything you want in this kind of monster movie. This is a great introduction to the franchise as well as a respectable American adaptation for long time fans."
"p-jonsson","6","3","4","21 September 2014"," Somewhat entertaining movie with a lousy script
","Why must Hollywood scriptwriters of some genres of movies, especially monster, superhero and horror movies, so often think that the audience are total idiots? Or maybe they themselves are severely lacking in brainpower and do not understand the level of trash in what they spew out. In Godzilla scriptwriter Dave (David) Callaham should have a special dishonorable mention for ruining a promising movie.<br/><br/>The movie started of with the obligatory nuclear power plant scenes. When it started I first thought, oh no not the blame nuclear power scare again. However, as it turned out, this was not so. Unfortunately, this was pretty much the only good part in the entire script. The rest of the script is just a collection of illogical, unintelligent garbage.<br/><br/>It starts quite quickly when Ford's father suddenly pulls of his mask, takes a sniff, and declares that there is no radioactivity in the air. Only a scientifically ignorant idiot writes something like that. Then we have the scene were the soldiers rush into The Nevada nuclear waste facility and checks the inspection hatch on every door until they find one where there is a light only to discover that the monster have broken free and left a gargantuan hole. A huge monster have broken through the walls of a nuclear waste facility leaving a whole big enough to drive a battleship through and no one would have noticed until some marines goes around and inspects the doors on the inside? Again, you have to be pretty unintelligent to write a scene like that.<br/><br/>The entire plot is basically the same unintelligent mess. They follow the creatures around until they reach civilization. First then do they actually try and do something. That is just so nonsensical. In the case that a huge city-destroying creature would approach any large population center it would be blasted way before it reached it. Also, when they do attack they fire some light weaponry and maybe a tank gun or two against it. If millions of people were at risk I think it is not a very far fetched belief that the military would throw everything they had at the threat. And do not get me started on the hair-brained scheme of luring out the monsters to the sea with a nuke. What a load of bullocks! Okay, so with all this ranting, why did I give the movie as much as 6 out of 10 stars? Well, I am a fan of huge monster movies and the parts where the monsters rampage around destroying things or slugging it out against each others are great. Unfortunately this is pretty much the good that can be said about this movie."
"Gresh854","7","12","25","19 May 2014"," One of the Most Satisfying Remakes of All Time
","Before I talk about anything about this movie I just have to say, Godzilla is the best giant monster/robot fighting in a city movie I have ever seen. Yes, it was better than Pacific Rim. <br/><br/>Godzilla was definitely a must see movie this year. If you think its going to be like Godzilla (1998) then you our wrong, that movie was bad. This movie is just so awesome! Like in my other reviews I'm going to divide it up because I feel likedividing it up.<br/><br/>Comparison from 1998 and the Original - Gozilla 1954 was one of the most famous classic movies of all time. And its a good movie especially for people who watched it in the 50s. Godzilla 1998 was bad and it basically ripped of every Jurassic Park Scene. Plus they made Godzilla look like a skinny, small dinosaur. This Godzilla is no doubt the best of them all. And if your like,""But the Classic ones are always the best,"" well then your wrong. Because you have to admit you didn't fall asleep as much as you did in Gozilla's 1954. So I have to say this is the best Godzilla film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Characters - First character I am going to talk about is of course Godzilla. How they made Godzilla was exactly what I wanted him to look like. He looks pretty accurate to the classic Godzilla which is good not like 1998 where he looked like a horrible CGI dinosaur. They pot rayed Godzilla so well in this movie, its almost like you can really see him stopping around your city. So i am very satisfied with how they made Godzilla. Mothra was actually in this movie. Mothra is actually a old classic character to and it was really cool how they put her in it. Yes its a she because the creature was pregnant at the time of the movie. That character was portrayed very well too, kind of reminded me of Pacific Rim aliens for some reason. Bryan Cranston did a very good job making the audience have feelings for him, he seemed to be very into his character. The problem was that he wasn't in the movie a whole lot instead Aaron Taylor- Johnson was in it most of the movie. He didn't seem to catch the audiences attention as much as Bryan did but he did a pretty good job at being in the movie because he had to. Also Ken Watanabe, who was the scientist, wasn't that much of a main character, but he did a good job playing the scientist because he seemed to be so into Godzilla and knowing about him.<br/><br/>Story - The story was a bit long in the beginning but overtime it makes you grow excitement and eagerness to see Godzilla beat the living lives out of city buildings and gigantic monsters and this eagerness makes you love Godzilla a lot once he finally appears on screen. Then overtime the story gets pretty good and the scenes get you pumped up and excited and its a fairly, pretty good plot. The story about the monsters are also really good too but you don't get a whole lot about the creatures origins. Scenes/Action Sequences - Again, best gigantic Robot/Monster fighting in a gigantic city scenes I have ever seen. I thought it was better scenes in Pacific Rim just because the robots were quite slow and it wasn't as exciting as watching the flying Mothras beat the you now what out of Godzilla. Godzilla is just such an iconic character you just can hate fight scenes with him in it. I can't spoil about the fight scenes but I wish I could because they are so amazing, but trust me, when you see this movie, you're are going to walk pout of the theater saying,""That was Freaking Awesome."" Mainly the action scenes were what made this movie so good. No its not like Pacific Rim were its a awesome dumb robot fighting movie, this is an emotional awesome monster fighting movie right here. The monsters actually pot rayed some emotions which was absolutely great! Yes, the monsters devoted some heart into the film which really helped make this more than a giant monster/robot fighting Pacific Rim movie. Even with the humans there was a lot of heart devoted into the film with them.<br/><br/>Pros And Cons -<br/><br/>Pros -<br/><br/>Amazing Action Sequences Great Plot and Story Developing Suspense Great Characters Superb CGI Animation Cons -<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is in the movie to little Long Beginning<br/><br/>Overall - Overall Godzilla was one of the greatest satisfactions in a movie remake I have ever seen, because movie remakes are never really that good. I am satisfied, and if your looking for a good action packed summer film Godzilla is your #1 option. (A)"
"hitchcockthelegend","6","4","6","29 November 2015"," The big atomic lizard gets another make over.
","Back in 1954 Ishirô Honda introduced to the film world Gojira, a creature that is still today seen as viable cinematic interest. Gojira, in spite of being a man in a rubber suit monster movie, is a smart and feisty film. Tapping into an oppressive nuclear age via moody atmospherics, whilst simultaneously imbuing plenty of creature feature carnage, it got the balance right. The makers of Godzilla 2014 have tried to do the same, they look back fondly to the original wave, pay it respect, but sadly they don't quite pull it off.<br/><br/>Plot essentially finds the world under attack by some Kaiju (MUTO) monsters after humans keep dabbling in all things nuclear. The end is nigh, that is unless mankind can find an ally in Godzilla, an almighty prehistoric type lizard who itself is a product of some prior nuclear shenanigans.<br/><br/>The human plot strands feature the usual secretive government suits mixing with science guys, all looking worried or running around in a fretful state. There's a father and son axis – with the son a bad ass army guy who has a loving wife and child back home. Characters are many, and they take up a good portion of the film, unfortunately very few of them are interestingly written, which is a shame given the pic is packed with acting talent.<br/><br/>It's a two hour plus movie, with the build up being very prolonged, with Zilla not showing up till the hour mark. This renders the main monster as a bit player in its own movie, a mistake often made by others in many a sequel to Honda's original. There's also the irritating fact that what all good Zilla movies need is a shed load of monster mayhem, plenty of smack-downs, but sadly they are in short supply here and are often rendered as background staples. Until the finale that is<br/><br/>It takes a long time to get there, but thankfully saving the pic from below average hell, it's not a let down. It thrills and opens up the eyes and ears considerably, and fans of all things Zilla will get goosebumps upon the arrival of the charge and breathing of nuclear fire sequence. But with that comes the annoyance that the good technical craft within the piece has previously been used sparingly, the decision to put bland characters at the forefront instead of cinema's most famous monster proving to be a huge error.<br/><br/>Maybe, just maybe, it's time to let sleeping atomic lizard's lie? Or of course there's always Kong to join the fray for franchise steering purpose... 6.5/10"
"martyaxwar","3","4","6","29 September 2015"," wow, did this movie disappoint
","I went into this quite hyped but cautious. I have read and seen a ton of positive reviews for this movie. It was supposed to be so much better than the terrible remake from '98. I'm always cautious though and try to see a movie for what it is.<br/><br/>Let's see: This movie has something over ten minutes of Godzilla in it. I'm all for build-up and some of my most beloved movies are very slow, building up tension or focusing on character studies.<br/><br/>That's exactly what this movie tried to do. And I can't stress TRIED TO enough.<br/><br/>At first, it focused on a father, played by Cranston. This was, in terms of acting and character, the somehow mediocre (I won't bring up hammyness in a Godzilla movie) highlight of this movie. It was semi-interesting and would maybe keep me going if they didn't kill the character at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie focuses on his son- a soldier, played by Taylor-Johnson, and boy is his character ark and delivery terrible! You're supposed to care about him and his family but I couldn't bring myself to.<br/><br/>I felt like they partially knew what they were going for with a part of the movie, then lost track, cut in some monster parts and marketed it as suspenseful and that's kinda it.<br/><br/>So what do you get most of the time? A few clever original Godzilla references, A FEW SHORT nice monster moments you can go watch on YT, a short semi-interesting story arc and loads of boring uninspired crap.<br/><br/>All in all: A very disappointing movie. I wasn't just disappointed by the movie itself, but also by the mostly positive critical reception.<br/><br/>I wouldn't at all recommend this. Just go watch the monster scenes somewhere. You've already seen the nicely done trailer. That's all you need to see and it won't take up too much time."
"taylorkingston","4","4","6","26 April 2015"," Not as good as the 1998 version...
","I know a lot of people hated the 1998 version of Godzilla and everyone thinks this movie is amazing. Well, I don't. I personally think it's a bit of a waste of time. I don't regret watching it, but I don't think that everyone needs to see it. It's no Rambo, Die Hard, Terminator or Back To The Future. Nothing will ever top those in my book. I think the main reason I didn't like this movie a lot is because the main character dies after about thirty minutes and Godzilla isn't the main character. He's not even the main villain. He turns out to be a good guy and help the humans. What?! That's not who Godzilla is. Godzilla is a big killing machine, not a helping machine. It's just backwards.<br/><br/>In this movie, Godzilla is pitted against another kind of lizard creature, who just wants to find its mate and have babies. But we can't let that happen. In the end, Godzilla wins and floats back into the ocean.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 4 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Kinda Sucks."
"Floated2","4","4","6","3 March 2015"," Expected More
","Did not see the massive overly hype from Godzilla as the fans did not expect. The failure to coherently tie-in the nuclear allegory literally kills the film from the get go. The audience is treated to a vague flashback to a Fukushima-like event which sparks a series of events that ultimately leads Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to set off on his own personal quest to find answers to these mysterious questions that had huge ramifications on his own family as well. The problem here - despite some interesting references to the ""truth"" behind a series of Eisenhower-era atomic tests in the Pacfic - over time, there never really is any clear link between the nuclear story and the evolution of Godzilla and other similar monsters.<br/><br/>Towards the conclusion of the film we're treated to hours of human interaction that is poorly developed. Audiences are introduced to an endless series of new characters such as Joe's son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson - in a performance that was as vague and boring as most of the film), his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn - clearly just collecting a paycheck) - and yet it's hard to care about any of them. All this because any time we get a glimpse of their motivations, the movie swings to the next ludicrous crisis and the actors are left to fill brain dead roles in yet another Hollywood disaster movie.The expectations for several monster love fans for the film can differ however, what we witnessed was something that could have been fixed perhaps with a better more interesting script."
"The Grand Master","5","4","6","6 January 2015"," Good special effects can't save Godzilla
","The trailer for the 2014 version of Godzilla looked very promising, however the end result was average at best. The cast was good, especially Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe and I also liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the lead who certainly has come a long way from Kick-Ass. The special effects looked really good, but the story itself was disappointing which let the whole movie down, and the ending was terrible. I will not put in any spoilers except to say that the ending was rushed and goes against the spirit of Godzilla. It was as if the movie had run out of ideas. Unless Godzilla is rebooted, I won't care for a sequel.<br/><br/>At least the 1998 version of Godzilla directed by Ronald Emmerich was slightly more enjoyable, despite the fact it received a mauling by critics.<br/><br/>5/10"
"rsj624","7","4","6","1 December 2014"," Better than '98, Worse than '54
","**This review may contain spoilers**<br/><br/>This new take on Godzilla is not a bad one, but it's not really the best either. I can get all kinds of technical about why it is that I think this movie is a B rather than an A, but honestly when it comes to blockbusters it's all about how they make you feel, since the focus is rarely ever on intelligence over explosions. <br/><br/>The problem with Godzilla is it's decision to focus the greater part of it's narrative on people and the Godzilla mythology rather than just Godzilla himself. Godzilla is present for hardly any of the movie outside of the last 45 minutes, and it's not really even clear as to whether or not he's a good guy till practically the end. They attempt to give the movie a humanity angle by throwing us several formulaic characters with the typical loss of a loved one cliché, and then proceed to dance around showing us any monsters for quite some time. <br/><br/>Not to sound like a die hard, but when I think Godzilla I think the ridiculous monster movies that I grew up watching, or hell even the 1998 adaptation which was all kinds of horrible, but at least that movie had it's focus on the spectacle that was Godzilla. Despite my harsh opinions towards this film, the things it does do right it does right without compromise, and the last 45 minutes makes up for the majority of the movies failures. <br/><br/>Pacific Rim is honestly a much better choice if you're looking for some supreme monster beat 'em up moments."

It's marvellous stuff, the only truly electrifying scene in the picture.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards follows his debut Monsters, a fine-looking movie with a mediocre script, with his new version of Godzilla, a great-looking movie with an average script.<br/><br/>See, humongous CGI beasts trashing up a city can be visually striking, but need a strong human element to underpin them. Godzilla appears to provide it in the form of Bryan Cranston's obsessed scientist Brody (Jaws reference duly noted), a fairly interesting lead who gets dispatched one-third into the picture to be replaced with his stoic G.I. Joe son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), as generic as blockbuster protagonists get, the son's pretty nurse wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and their inevitable little kid. It's tedious stuff, and no amount of visual spectacle can turn a boilerplate script into some popcorn masterpiece.<br/><br/>The great Ken Watanabe gets to spout exposition and look awed a lot, while Juliette Binoche gets to die within a minute of screen time.<br/><br/>Well, at least it's no Roland Emmerich's Godzilla, I'll give it that.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"MovieNinjaGuy","3","10","20","17 May 2014"," Boring, no fun and quite awful
","I wanted to walk out of this film. It was so serious and boring. Almost sleep inducing. Sure the monster effects are superb but that doesn't make a film in my opinion. More like a demonstration of a graphics card. I would say the 90s film was far more entertaining, at least they got some comedy moments in there from Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. <br/><br/>Godzilla's size seems to change during this film as well and many things seem weird, stupid and unnecessary. Why look for a monster in a nuclear waste storage building when you can see from the outside that half of a mountain is missing? Does every monster fight have to be at night? Why mess about shipping nuclear warheads across the country when you can launch nuclear missiles with the push of a button sitting in a nice comfy bunker?<br/><br/>The characters in this film were completely forgettable, very superficial and extremely stereo typical. It takes all the Roland Emmerich stuff basically but removes the fun and it doesn't seem to keep you interested even remotely. The main character made me think of Lois Lane in Man of Steel (another weak WB / Legendary film I think). He managed to transport himself to wherever the action is and of course his dad is the conspiracy theory nut who had figured it all out before anyone else. All very convenient. Why not spread his tasks across different characters? This is what the 90s movie did right I think.<br/><br/>Weak story line but someone who I was with did point out that many elements are true to the original Godzilla stories as crazy as they were.<br/><br/>This film wasn't worth my time for the trip to the cinema and I am disappointed I got excited about on the basis of very favourable early reviews. I am quite suspicious of those to be honest."
"Fluke_Skywalker","3","10","20","17 May 2014"," Godzilla? More like Godawful
","Though well made on a technical level, director Gareth Edwards' updated version of 'Godzilla' is a flat, joyless, thrill-free experience that lumbers by more slowly than its titular star.<br/><br/>The strong cast are unable to do anything with their ham-fisted dialog and two dimensional characters, and the script takes the absurdity of the premise far too seriously.<br/><br/>Worst of all, Godzilla is relegated to what amounts to an extended cameo. Edwards seems to be trying to mimic Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws', where the great white shark remains mostly unseen for the bulk of the movie. The problem with trying that here is, it's a monster movie, and people want to see a throw-down. What we get instead are several almost rumbles before *finally* getting the monster mash we came for. Unfortunately it's all too little too late.<br/><br/>'Godzilla' is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. A colossal disappointment and a complete waste of your time."
"poe426","5","10","20","16 May 2014"," Plodzilla: Slow. Very... very... slow...
","GODZILLA 2014 is an excruciatingly slow soap opera with a giant monster thrown in almost as an afterthought. In fact, take out Gojira altogether and what you have is a television-sized soap opera about a military man and his family with video game cgi battle scenes. Consider this puzzling fact: every time Gojira and one of the other two monsters in the movie butt heads, the director cuts away to something else (the first time, he cuts away to a television newscast of the monster, the second he literally has a door close on the action, shutting the viewer within and the battle without). We also get to see the After Party aftermath, but never the REASON for the rubble... For some of us, we paid twenty bucks to see THE MONSTERS, not the soap. I almost applauded when the sole Japanese cast member (who has a bit part as a scientist who stands around doing a lot of heavy thinking), says (of the monsters), ""Let them fight."" Even though this admonition came about two hours into this three-hour ordeal, the audience I saw the movie with (a good dozen people were there) breathed a collective sigh of relief. Finally, we were going to see some action! And we did- and it was great (the fx guys knock it out of the park); but it was also too little, too late to save GODZILLA. The Rol Em version was FAR superior (this version is about as humorless as it gets, what with the pointless and seemingly never-ending military musings). See this one for the Big Brawl at the end or because you like state-of-the-art fx, but don't expect a whole lot else."

","So I was actually enticed by the trailer for this film. You didn't see the actual monster in many scenes, if at all, and it looked like it had a darker and more realistic feel to it than most monster movies. Then, to my disappointment, the movie is just the complete opposite. Once the monkey is out of the cage, it's just an endless monster battle. The plot is ridiculous. Most of the time, decisions made by the people in command are obviously horrendous. Acting was sub par. Only thing this movie does well is special effects, which are quite spectacular. But that can't help save it from misery, as the stupidity in this movie just keeps on piling up throughout.<br/><br/>I really don't understand the raving reviews this movie has gotten on this site. Anyway, obviously people have different taste, but this is just a warning, that if you thought that this was going to be a different type of monster movie, with intense, dark, gritty atmosphere, you were wrong, and you will be disappointed, just like me. I can not recommend this movie to anyone."

"shanescx","10","13","28","16 May 2014"," Epic!
","This is the first time I ever write a review in IMDb, basically because I couldn't resist to praise this film.<br/><br/>Actually I wasn't anticipating this movie at all, due to the not-so- attracting trailer and lack of information given out (I was never a fan of the original Gojira Series because I have never watched any of those) but after watching this movie I could understand why Gojira came out in 1954 and became a symbol, a name that is as loud as the word 'monster'. The mind-blowing effects must have resembled the original Gojira in the 1954 - The CGI used in this movie gives the same impact as the physical effect used that day. I can say this even though I hadn't watched any Gojira before, because I am a huge fan of Ultraman series - which is another Japanese TOKUSATSU show(I have to capitalize it to show IMDb that wasn't a spelling mistake), first made in 1966 with the concept of watching a Godzilla every week on TV. The fight scene reminds me of the Ultraman fight I watched in my childhood. While there is a little 'bonus', or Easter egg, or whatever I couldn't find the right English word for it, but there was the sound effect used in the battle when Godzilla fights the two MUTOs at a time, had a feeling of the old 60 & 70s' Japanese TOKUSATSU genre. Now come back to this movie.<br/><br/>Plot, good. Characters, damn good. Pacing, great. And effects as I said, pure awesome. Actually the plot wasn't very rich, and if someone writes that into a synopsis, it's gonna be quite boring. I have to say this movie is more character driven, you see how people react when disaster comes, the emotions within and towards other people, especially families. Although probably won't cry, but there are lots of moments that you would feel the characters in the film. If you are someone like me, while watching other blockbuster movies and care more about the civilization in the background (Man of Steel, just an example), this movie will satisfy you, because this film not only tells you what happened to them, but actually make you feel for them. Go see it. Because if you don't, it's going to be a loss for you."

It's what's making this amazing, we care about who we should care. They didn't tell the story people wanted to be told, they tell the story needed to be told. So it makes it perfect.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson was a likable protagonist and Elisabeth Olsen portrayed his wife, and they looked like a believable couple(shame about the chubby kid though.) The film is a constant source of suspense and your eyes will be glued to the screen. They nailed the Godzilla roar and also a few other classic traits, you'll be well pleased.<br/><br/>I would happily watch this movie again, and move goers should prepare themselves for the true king of monsters!"

","In 1999, in Japan, there is a mysterious accident with the reactors of the Janjira nuclear power plant and the engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife Sandra Brody (Juliette Binoche) and her team that were inspecting the reactor. Joe never accepts the official explanation for the accident. Fifteen years later, his son, the US Navy Officer Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), learns that Joe has trespassed in Janjira quarantine area and is arrested in Japan. He travels to Japan to release his father and they go to the Janjira facility area to retrieve Joe's data and pictures. Soon they discover the truth about the accident, caused by a ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" (""MUTO"") that eats radiation trapped underground. The MUTO escapes from the secret facility to Honolulu killing Joe. Godzilla is also awakened, causes a tsunami in Hawaii and fights against the MUTO destroying Honolulu. Meanwhile a female MUTO escapes from the Nevada nuclear waste facility and destroys Las Vegas, heading to breed with the first MUTO in San Francisco. Now the last hope on Earth is Godzilla fighting and destroying the MUTO's. <br/><br/>""Godzilla"" (2014) is a deceptive version of the legendary Japanese monster. An action movie that makes the viewer take naps certainly has problems in the screenplay. There is a silly, boring and corny subplot with the inexpressive Aaron Taylor-Johnson that is a waste of time. The cameo of Juliette Binoche lures their fans with her name in the credits. The cinematography is too dark and hard to be followed in some fights. And in the end, the dinosaur-like monster becomes the savior of the mankind in a senseless conclusion. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Godzilla"""
"headbangingfilms","6","11","23","1 June 2014"," Absolutely the best Godzilla movie since the original
","I loved this movie and even with my super high expectations i was impressed especially when the first roar on screen and when he fights MUTO in the end. totally epic and completely worth the price of the tickets. all the talk about bad characters in the second act or that Aaron Johnson falls flat in his performance are totally wrong and unwarranted. this was the best written Godzilla movie since the original and no other Godzilla movie has more relatable characters. the Godzilla design is amazing and is not fat! my only critique is that Godzilla's fight with MUTO didn't go longer, now that's not to say it wasn't a good fight but i simply think that the ending could have been longer. all in all i loved it and i was giddy like a little school boy when he first comes on screen. any Godzilla who says they didn't like this movie needs to watch it again because it's just that good."
"dbutler-5-608400","1","11","23","19 May 2014"," Absolute trash
","Many of the other bad reviews have nailed it. After Bryan Cranston dies, this movie turns to dung. How bad? Well, Matthew Broderick's movie is looking pretty good right now......<br/><br/>What ticked me off the most was that all of the commercials and early talk of this movie were making comparisons to the original film from the 50's, about Godzilla being this sort of metaphor for our nuclear misdeeds, and how menacing the monster is and how scary he is. The commercials make you think he's the main bad guy and he just ends up fighting other monsters who somehow get involved. Wrong. Godzilla from the get-go is kind of the hero of the movie. He's not even really considered a threat by the military, we don't really bother to fight him, nor him us, although we sometimes get in his way. There's actually several scenes where you have the great old US Navy steaming alongside Godzilla as he's heading to go kill the bad creatures. Gawd, I was groaning at this point. It was like the old cartoon where we'd call up Godzilla to save the day with a button. He was neither scary nor intimidating. He doesn't really destroy any cities or buildings per se, his sole act of bad-guy ness was really the brief tsunami you saw in the commercials. Otherwise he's just kinda stomping around town fighting the monsters. After he kills them both at the end, he promptly leaves for the water without killing anybody...kinda like, ""Hey humans, it's all okay now!"" Gawd, even the TV channel depicted in the movie puts up an info banner on the screen saying 'Godzilla-Savior of the city!' Another major annoyance was that they took a bit of a cue from 'Cloverfield' and decided to NOT show you a lot of stuff, instead they'd put it on a TV in the background of some stupid personal drama scene. You don't get to see the first encounter with Godzilla and the MUTO creature, because they cut away to a scene with a TV in the background to show only part of it. You don't get to see the bigger MUTO destroy Las Vegas, because they cut away from it and instead only show the monster 'leaving' Las Vegas, lol.... On a TV in the background. All the potentially good stuff in actuality ends up on a TV somewhere in another scene.<br/><br/>Oh, and that's another thing. You really don't see the military actually engage any of these creatures. Perhaps a missile or two fired offscreen, but there are not really any tanks, artillery, big defenses, etc. No stand up fighting by our military. It's just a lot of stupid stuff with small groups of soldiers or shown on a TV in the background, and most everything is centered around the main character who seemingly ends up all over the place owing to his status as a Lieutenant in an EOD squad??? Maybe if he was a General.... There's one scene where you get your hopes up, as some tanks and soldiers are on the Golden Gate bridge, and yet while they begin to engage Godzilla, they instead cut away to some bus driver who decides to escape the action. Then they cut away to you seeing perhaps 5 seconds of this fighting...in the far distance. Then they cut away entirely to some personal drama stuff. <br/><br/>Contrary to what others have said, the CGI is rather dull and Godzilla honestly didn't look very good. He's often blurry in the few daylight glimpses you get of him, or clouded by smoke. The fact that all of the monster fights happen in the dark tell you that bad CGI is being compensated for here. 'Pacific Rim' was 10x better on the effects than this movie. Godzilla's body and everything about him also seemed too fluid, like he had no skeletal structure. Did I mention the CGI was bad? And he's got the weirdest looking peg legs and an awful amount of lower body weight. <br/><br/>Godzilla's nuclear breath is also lame. It 'looks' good, it just doesn't DO anything. There's no real sound effect for it, and it seems like a pulse/push type ray that just seems ineffective. He uses it only twice. Not that he had much time to. Godzilla is indeed only in the film for about 10 minutes. I got the distinct impression that they simply included it because they knew that Godzilla must do this at some point. <br/><br/>Godzilla does only 3 cool things in the entire movie. Two of them are the times he roars into the camera. Nice. The third is a tail slap he does on one of the monsters, however, he looks entirely too pleased with himself after doing so. It was bad watching him revel in his own awesomeness, lol. Too bad though that you can barely see this happen, it's so frigging dark in these scenes."
"scheilinkin","1","11","23","18 May 2014"," Boring movie filled with awful clichés
","I expected everything form this one, and by that I mean everything good. But ...<br/><br/>Movie really dies with Cranston's character within first 20-30 minutes, and after that every single scene and plot development is tied closely to some of the worst movie clichés I have ever seen in one movie. 50 times or even more there was a scene where my internal voice said ""How convenient!"". By the end of the film I was laughing out loud, because I was surprised of how low they can go with the story.<br/><br/>Didn't watched 3D version, because of 2D to 3D post conversion, of which I am not a fan. Because if its not a real 3D, why would I have to pay the full 3D price. So happy for Bryan Cranston, he got his money a earned it completely. Nobody else earned it in this disaster of a movie."
"alasdelombriz","1","11","23","18 May 2014"," Worst movie ever.
","This is the worst movie i have seen in a long time. It is horrible written, acted and directed. It has every monster movie cliché in it, and it does them very poorly. The plot is predictable the monster battles are to short and they keep cutting back to the main human characters. But they never developed these guys so you do not care about them and are angry you are missing most of the monster battle. The only good character they kill off in the first ten minutes. Also this is a movie that tries to show how dangerous the monsters are buy showing the military as stupid. If you want a good Godzilla movie watch the original or even the 1998 remake was better done then this peace of crap. Both were done better in every way possible event the special effects."
"Irie212","2","11","23","16 May 2014"," An astounding film, for all the wrong reasons
","The original ""Godzilla"" (1954) has had 27 remakes. Remember the 1998 ""Godzilla""? The one with the planned sequels that never happened because it was a Razzie-winning bomb? In terms of everything but the visual effects, it was better than this one. In fact, I wondered if this director, a certain Gareth Edwards, was influenced by its director, Roland Emmerich, who is reigning king of big & cheesy cinema (though ""2012"" had merits). If Edwards did choose to emulate Emmerich, then we know all we need to about his motives ($) and his integrity as an artist ($$$).<br/><br/>Yet, astoundingly, this ""Godzilla"" has a redeeming quality: It could be taught in film school: Film 101: How NOT to Make a Movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay is almost a tour de force of corny dialog. It might be the result of writer Max Borenstein meticulously collecting all the trite dialog in horror films since ""The Monster Walks"" (1932, with an IMDb rating of 3.9). The writing is the worst flaw, of course, because it's so basic, but even the sound and sound editing, which action pictures have perfected, is amateurish. It reminded me of Spinal Tap: turned up to 11. Ditto the score, which was written by the usually reliable Alexandre Desplat (he provided the only reason to see ""Grand Budapest Hotel""). I wasn't the only person sitting in the theater with 3-D glasses on my face and my fingers in my ears. <br/><br/>The characters are-- well, there aren't any. The two leads, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, were ciphers, but they're cast together in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), so let's hope Joss Whedon can elicit lifelike performances from them. Genuine talents that are wasted include Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, David Straithairn, Richard T. Jones, Juliette Binoche, and Bryan Cranston, who here proves that even an actor at the top of his game can stink up the joint.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards appears to know nothing about how to structure a story, control action, direct actors, or even manage continuity. Based on ""Godzilla,"" he should have stuck to his original career in visual effects. The action scenes here, once the plot lands in San Francisco, are skillfully done and fun to watch. Godzilla itself (himself? herself?) is also a fun creation, as are the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms (MUTOs), but that may be because Andy Serkis consulted behind the scenes."

","The new Godzilla Before I saw the movie I just wanted to see the 'joe-shmoe' reviews and ignore critics; who hated Godzilla but they usually hate every movie I love- but to get on point,-with each appearance Godzilla makes he gets better and his awesomeness builds. The acting cast was great.<br/><br/>This Godzilla has a similar air to something like the original 'Jaws' movie, you knew what the movie was about but the shark wasn't present throughout the whole film & you still got the sense of what was going on and so forth. Godzilla is the same way even though 'The King of Monsters' only had a few minutes actual screen time - his presence lingered through every line and scene just like it should be. When Godzilla finally had his moment and trust me, he does-it is so epic and you're like ""Oh s***, it just got real!"" He wears his crown back into the ocean with the crashing waves and fading music behind him. It couldn't have ended better. TAKE THAT 98 'ZILLA!<br/><br/>OVER ALL I wish Godzilla was in it more, just a bit more. There was a moment when I thought wait.. this is about Godzilla right? Because the dialog just drags at a certain point in my opinion, and you feel a little left out hanging when Godzilla does appear and a little unsatisfied when the scene changes back to the sexy soldier man, but I guess that's the point because each time he *Godzilla* appeared it just got better. 9/10"

","What can you say about a film that renders fully Digital 3D the experience of GODZILLA coming crashing through your driveway, saving you from mutant bugs? These bugs are huge, they're going to need a solid GODZILLA stump to be put down, and this film delivers. GODZILLA'S feet are extraordinarily big, and his legs look amazing. Now, did this film have fire-breath, yes. Did it have Mothra or King Ghidorah? No, those are in the next movie. But did it have Aaron Taylor-Johnson, mother of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" director Sam Taylor- Johnson? Yes, it did. <br/><br/>The film opens with a GODZILLA buried in the ground, the scientists look at it and think ""This... is huge."" Next, cut to a nuclear asylum in Japan where American Joe Brody is hiring the Japanese. A mutant radiation bug tramples the towers, and Joe Brody is murdered. His son, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, grows up and vows to defeat the bug to avenge his dad.<br/><br/>This is where GODZILLA comes in. Ford Brody prays for retribution, and GODZILLA is awoken by his pure tears. As the mutant bugs tear down more and more nuclear asylums, GODZILLA comes butting in with his tail, his breath, and his pure fury to bring down the bugs once and for all. Is GODZILLA the Savior of Humanity? Yes. 10/10 A+<br/><br/>There are supporting characters in the film. Scientist man and woman, Brody wife, Brody wife 2, MUTO Mutant Organism, Holocaust professor, nuclear scientist. They each deserve a nod and serve as a satisfying figure of character in the film. Practically a character himself is GODZILLA, who is large and animated. The special effects in this film are done well, and I'm not just saying that because I was an extra in this movie. The sound design is phenomenal, the sound is practically a phenomenon to behold. When GODZILLA roars, it's not just a traditional GODZILLA roar, it's THIS GODZILLA roar.<br/><br/>My ultimate conclusion about this movie is that it just plain rocked. There were better movies in 2014, but this was it. The Best Movie of 2014 wasn't Birdman, it was GODZILLA 2014, and here's proof."
"ironhorse_iv","7","7","13","18 May 2014"," Godzilla is indeed King of all monsters! It was pretty good movie.
","It's about time, they try to reboot the Toho Pictures Godzilla film franchise. Glad, the film studio didn't repeat themselves, with the disappointment of Tri-Star 1998's Godzilla. It really did look like there wasn't going to be a Godzilla film ever again. Since, Tri-Star had no clue, how to use the characters right, and Toho getting tired of making Godzilla movies after the release of 2004's Godzilla: Final Wars, which mark the 50th anniversary of the Godzilla film franchise. Toho did announced that it would not produce any films featuring the Godzilla character for ten years. Indeed, they kept that odd promise. It wasn't until 2014, that this Warner Bros' modernization version of Godzilla directed by Gareth Edwards came out to retells the origins of Godzilla. In my opinion, the screenplay could need some retouching, as there is way too much plot holes, and lack of exposition. Without spoiling too much of it, the movie has everything, you would think would be in a Godzilla movie. Yes, they even have the atomic breath. Also, don't bother watching the movie trailers as they are very misleading, coming in. First off, the movie trailer, makes Bryan Cranston look like the main character, but he isn't in the movie long enough. It was very disappointing, how misused he was in this. I guess, they wanted the Alfred Hitchcock Psycho like twist surprise. Still, Bryan Cranston gives his A-Game performance in it. Most of the other human characters are bland and uninteresting. You spend a majority of the film following Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody, who I like as an actor but does nothing with his character's personality here. The family drama that has no impact on the larger story, and was bit disappointing. I thought, there could be more Japanese or Japanese-Americans add to the film. After all, this is supposed to be homage to the older films. The only main Japanese, Scientist Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanbe) more felt like a fan-boy, than a real Scientist. His only job seemed to be to speak the subtext in order to inform the audience that Godzilla is actually supposed to be the good guy without any prove of that. Second off, Godzilla isn't the main threat like the trailers, make him out to be. In the film, Cloverfield type monsters known as MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) pose more a threat. Godzilla, himself, has a very slow build that might anger some viewers. It really didn't anger me, because a lot of Godzilla's films have slow builds. When they finally showed Godzilla, it had that great money shot of him roaring right in the camera and it made the seats in the theater shake. It was a great way to build up anticipation and hype up excitement from the fans. The director was going for a deliberate effect in keeping him off-screen for much of the movie, which works well, in my opinion. Hell, 1975's Jaws does the same thing. Lots of film references to that film like the main characters being name after the family in Jaws. So, the director knew how to keep the suspense. One thing, I didn't get, is how the movie quickly makes Godzilla, the hero. Yes, he wasn't trying to destroy anything, but Savior of San Francisco? Hmmm I doubt that. The city is really wrecked. Honestly, the movie never explain, where he came from or why he was hunting the Muto creatures, in the first place. The CGI & action scenes were good, and didn't mind that the film skip some of the big fights, as I know it was building up to something grand. Don't worry, they hint at it, with the use of background television, and GPS, that the three monsters would end up fighting. The movie was beautifully shot. I love the human's point of views. The haunting scene of them sky jumping into the ruins of San Francisco is just epic. The cinematography was beautiful. Honestly, I thought the military were really dumb, and made the whole conflict even worst with the nukes. What was the whole point of fighting monsters that feed on radioactive material, with nuclear weapons? It clearly backfired. The 3D is alright, but there isn't a lot to see there in 3D as most of the fights are in the dark. It's better off, watching it in 2D. The movie's symbolism for PG-13 is very haunting from the thoughts of Hiroshima to similarities to 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster. I wish the movie would have more humor. Despite what some people say, there is plenty of Godzilla action in a movie call Godzilla. So overall: check it out! You have a roaring good time."
"itz_henry_jai","7","7","13","17 May 2014"," Decent movie, not that great.
","I will cut to the chase -- the movie wasn't that great in my opinion. Definitely over-hyped by fans, the trailer and years of hiatus. Sure, the CGI was top notch. I will agree with any other reviewers regarding the fight scenes and CGI. The movie felt very dark and epic. Godzilla was Godzilla, not the one in the 1998 movie (that looks more like a dinosaur) than a radioactive lizard. One thing I want to point out was that the fight scenes lasted 30 sec to 1 minute, until the ending. It felt annoying to see something so epic only to get a feel of a ""commercial break"".<br/><br/>I will confess I haven't read any of the graphic novels or watched the old Godzilla films except for the 1998 American version. For once, I would like to thank the writers for not making New York City the target of monster destruction. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Destruction takes place in parts of Japan, Hawaii and California.<br/><br/>If I didn't know any better, Godzilla was more of a cameo. The movie doesn't explain how Godzilla came to be, why it was protecting the humans and why it wanted to ""balance"" out humanity from the brink of destruction by the other two MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism.) Seriously, Godzilla appears out of nowhere then proceeds to do its iconic roar/screech which, I swear, made some of the audiences wet. Despite getting shot by American soldiers when it first made its appearance, Godzilla brushes off the damage and continues to fight the MUTOs. Towards the end, the Japanese scientist says to not attack Godzilla and let it fight the other MUTOs. Oh, like that was so helpful. After Godzilla kills both MUTOs, it falls to the ground, which made the audience think it has died from all the fighting. But, it wakes up and walks back to the ocean, but not before roaring one last time. THE END. What the ----??? Okay, I understand that's what Godzilla is known for -- it comes out of the ocean and saves the humans from giant monsters, then walks back into the ocean. Apparently, there will be a sequel with Mothra since there was one scene that hints it.<br/><br/>Out of all the characters, Bryan Cranston played out his role the best. The trailer made it seem like he was the main character, but it was to mislead us. He had such a minor role, in which he performed so much better than the other characters combined, including his son (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson - Kick Ass). His son specializes in EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), but in the movie, he barely did anything with the nuclear bomb. So, what was the point of mentioning his skill anyways? Once again, I just wanted to say that the fight scenes was really good, but the story lacked solid details. I guarantee majority of reviewers rated this only for the CGI and not the story plot."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","7","7","13","17 May 2014"," The KING has returned in stunning glory and detail
","He has returned. THE KING OF THE MONSTERS has finally returned in all his glory. <br/><br/>Since the disaster of 1998, Godzilla's popularity and sense of power had faded away from general audience's memory and been replaced with a laughing stock created by Roland Emmerich. Now, thanks to the company that rebooted Batman and one British indie director named Gareth Edwards, we now have a Godzilla that is a return to form.<br/><br/>When you go into this movie you should know that the plot and characters are not film's strongest points (almost the weakest actually) as it is very straight–forward and predictable but really delivers a dark, serious and emotional tone rarely seen in monster films these day. It strongly taps into themes of the use of nuclear energy and how natural forces like earthquakes and tsunamis have affected us not just as a species but also the relationships within families. The cast does well to support the film with each of their roles serving purpose and not going to waste. Bryan Cranston is the highlight of the cast as he channels his inner ""Heisenberg"" but unfortunately does not get as much screen time as he deserves. Elizabeth Olsen shows a lot of excellent emotion and concern in her character as mother and wife who fears this monstrous event. Ken Wattanabe does excellently as this film's Serizawa (a character from the original) to represent the awareness of mankind's scientific carelessness. And this provides great contrast with David Strathairn showing a great sense of authority and believability in his role as a Navy admiral. Aaron Taylor Johnson, as the lead actor, was the least interesting but he becomes the best point of view with these giants he confronts as he tries to get back home.<br/><br/>While story and characters are not original, Gareth Edwards's direction gives this giant monster movie a fresh feel that makes you forget you have seen this same type of movie before. His style is pretty much like his first indie film Monsters but on a larger canvas with a strong sense of Spielberg. What separates the feeling of this Godzilla from most other blockbusters is the way the film is showing everything through human perspective as it gives a realistic and not-too-campy vibe that shows the creatures in absolute stunning detail and sequences. Edwards cleverly uses a lot of symbols and nods to reference the mythology of Toho monsters while also foreshadowing events that are to come. He also paints this world where giant monsters exists with stunning imagery that feels beautifully natural but also chaotic and haunting that makes you feel these events have actually happened. And the best part of his directing is creating suspense by cleverly finding ways to conceal these terrifying creatures and holding back on having too much action which is something that a lot of directors these days have lost. He has now become one of top 5 favourite directors of all time.<br/><br/>And finally, the best part of this movie is the monsters, especially the king himself, Godzilla. The VFX of these kaijus is so stunning and detailed that you almost feel that these creatures can exist. The Mutos (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) were well conceived as being these giant radiation-seeking predators that act as the main threat of the film. At first look, they seem like your typical insect design but over time the behaviour and movement resembles more closely to birds and mammals. There is even one scene in the film that feels romantic in a way when the male and female Mutos are reunited. But the real prize goes to Godzilla. He has everything the 1998 one lacked from his iconic form, his ferocity and invincibility to the most important feature that builds up very well by the end: Atomic breath! You really feel sense of power and size based on the way he moves his body and taking multiple hits from bullets and missiles without any damage. Though he is all cgi and not played by a guy in suit, you truly get a sense of the human element he carries with his expressions and the focus he has on bringing the Earth back to its natural order. This Godzilla is definitely the hero in this while the Muto's are more of antagonists but the film does not forget that both creatures are these destructive forces that kill thousands of human lives (probably actually more with Godzilla in the tsunami sequence). And as for climatic fight, don't imagine wrestling matches like the earlier films but more animalistic. This Godzilla's style of fighting is very bear like with him getting close and biting on the neck and limbs. The MUTOs are more tactical and careful with them using teamwork and their claws to impale Godzilla. It is almost disturbing to watch. There are quite a few instances in the final fight where you take pity on Godzilla with his struggle to take down his natural enemy.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the Godzilla that we have finally waited for. While the story is a typical monster movie, I would like to thank Gareth Edwards for giving Godzilla life again with strong human performances, amazing visual sequences and making everyone remember why Godzilla is the one true KING OF THE MONSTERS. <br/><br/>Thank you Gareth Edwards, thank you."
"DustinRahksi","7","7","13","15 May 2014"," A crowd pleaser, but not what we were hoping for.
","10 years, I've waited ten years for this, there was no way it could live up to the hype. This is all I have been doing the last 2 months, scouring the internet for Godzilla this and Godzilla that. I see why people are complaining about this film, and nitpicking ever inch. This was supposed to be the standard for any monster film to come. But the little snots who cry because this was supposed to be a masterpiece of cinema, it's Godzilla, what did you expect. I have viewed this film three times already, so let's get into it.<br/><br/>Audience reactions: The Thursday crowd didn't show much excitement. But the Friday group was going bananas, they cheered and clapped three times, it was a sold out theatre doing this, that is the first time I had ever seen that happen.<br/><br/>The story: It's a very well laid out structure, all be it a little rushed. The first hour sets everything up, it's slow. But once the Muto breaks free, the film is lightning fast, forget time relevance or pacing. The monster madness happens so fast that you don't get time to savour it. The last 30 minutes was rushed beyond belief, the entire city is destroyed in like 30 minutes real time. The pacing really is the biggest down fall of this film. You get nothing, then they tease you, then nothing, then they tease you, they you get everything, but you missed it. This is why you need to see it a second time, it actually improves when viewed again.<br/><br/>Characters/monsters: I forgot about Bryan Cranston just about as fast as the film did. Aaron Johnson was alright, Olsen was good. Ken didn't have much to do besides his( nature, Godzilla) love speech. Sally Hawkins is virtually unnoticeable. And David, he's alright. This film should have been called Muto, they have the most screen time and character development in the film. Who am I forgetting.... I know there is something missing. Oh yeah Godzilla's in this, with all of his 15 minutes of screen time, but it is a glorious 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Effects: The effects are top tier, everything looks great. The most impressive effect goes to the Muto's, they look real good. Like real life good. The cinematography really makes these monsters look larger than life. Godzilla looks good for the most part, but I'm not used to seeing him move so fast. The sound design is really good. Godzilla's roar rocks the whole theatre.<br/><br/>Best scenes: Anything with the Muto's in it, the bridge scene, the climax. But the best scene is hands down one of the most well crafted pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The Honolulu scene, my Godzilla it was so well paced and shot, this scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Notes: It's worth checking out for the casual viewer, I don't see why people wouldn't enjoy it. The action is great, the set pieces are great. And yes, this film is the best monster film since King Kong(2005), hey why not Jurassic Park, yes it is the best monster film since Jurassic park. After viewing this film for a third time, I have come to the conclusion that Gareth dropped the ball. Watch the teaser trailer, that is what I wanted, that is what the people needed. If he had just done that, and then done this film as a sequel, it would have been perfect. We really needed a film to set Godzilla up first."
"Ironed_Out","8","9","18","28 May 2014"," Godzilla (2014) - ambitious and admirable
","The first thing I thought whilst watching Godzilla and immediately after leaving was just how ambitious an attempt this was from director Gareth Edwards. He transferred from his very good low-budget film 'Monsters' to the other end of the spectrum, confirming, at the very least, he is a director with great potential.<br/><br/>What he produces is a fantastic monster movie and what I admired most about the film is that you can see just how ambitious he was when creating it. What he tries to achieve in only 2 hours of film is a credit to himself and the genre of film he is taking on. I am by no means a manic Godzilla fan. I watched the 1998 film when I was around 10 years old and, like any youngster, I had an obsession with Dinosaurs and the like so enjoyed the film immensely. But I am not one of those who has watched every trailer and had it book-marked as a 'must-see' film upon release. What I hoped to see, was a genuine attempt to make a serious, dark monster movie (again, I'm not a massive fan of the monster movie genre) and Edwards absolutely delivered that to my surprise.<br/><br/>To sum up his ambition, he tries his absolute best to dedicate as much time as is possible to the main lead (Ford Brody) as much as he does the monsters in this film. It may not pay-off entirely and maybe, in hindsight, he would've done things differently, but all the right intentions were there and it's certainly no failed attempt. We are introduced to his father, charismatically portrayed by Bryan Cranston, who dedicated as much passion as you'd see in any drama, and the fractured relationship between the two. We see Ford Brody's family, albeit briefly, and we are introduced to Elle, another solid performance from Elizabeth Olsen. All three give it their absolute best, although the selection of Aaron Taylor-Johnson may have been one of the areas to address if you had a second chance. He by no means is bad, but a different actor may have felt more believable. Ken Wantanabe and Sally Hawkins are mainly there to give us some insight into the films name-sake, and produce good performances, and the rest of the cast do solid jobs.<br/><br/>Edwards also looks to build as much suspense as he can before revealing Godzilla, something which I really liked. You get the pointers. You get references and the odd image, but he doesn't rush it upon us. My view is that once you've had the Godzilla reveal, and you've seen him on screen for 5 minutes, the novelty wears off. So I really liked the fact he tried to build suspense, whilst giving you one of the secondary monsters in this film to keep you engaged. Again, like the selection of some of the cast, he may have done things slightly differently if given the chance to re-make his re-make, but it's a brilliantly ambitious effort to dedicate as much time as he does to the human characters and to try and build suspense instead of just engaging us with 2 hours of mayhem. That comes very much in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>Once we get to the hour point, the main course is served. Godzilla is revealed and it turns into an action film for the majority of the remainder. As for Godzilla himself, and the two MUTOs, they are excellently done. I had feared from watching one trailer that Godzilla himself looked a bit 'B-movie'-ish, but he certainly doesn't. The special effects are very good and the set and characters almost become part of a stage for these three beasts who go to war and inflict as much damage as possible, which is why I felt the first hour worked so well. I'm a big fan of action films when done well. I start to lose interest when the action begins after the first minute and continues, non-stop, for the next 90, unless it's done to a really high standard. The destruction scenes in Godzilla are excellent and they are just the right length. I think 90 minutes to 2 hours of that and I would be writing a very different review.<br/><br/>And finally, just a word on the atmosphere and the way it's filmed, which I thought was the best and most unique part of Godzilla. There is one scene involving a halo jump that I thought was as good as any scene in any action film. The background music, the way it was shot (through the goggles of the main character), the darkness and the flickering lighting, sporadically revealing parts of the monster below as the men fell to what looked like hell. It was an incredible scene and the highlight of the movie. There are other scenes which leave their mark, where we get slight reveals of Godzilla but very rarely, in the entire film, do we see him in his entirety, another part which I found worked well.<br/><br/>All in all, Edwards and his cast can be incredibly proud of what they attempted and, ultimately, achieved. They decided to go for a serious tone, for a solid cast of actors either on the up or well established, and produce an atmospheric monster movie with an underlying human tale. Did it have faults? Of course. But I think the scale of this movie, the expectation upon the crew and the fact this is a film very early on in a promising directors career path means that the negatives should be ignored and replaced with the strengths of what this movie is. It's as good as you could hope of a summer monster blockbuster, and can take it's place not just in the monster genre, but in the action/drama category too."
"TheFilmGuy1","8","9","18","17 May 2014"," Godzilla Is A Great Summer Blockbuster
","I went into this film as a summer blockbuster and I will be reviewing it in that mindset too. I'm a fan of big monster movies that are done well. They give me a feeling that other movies don't. I really get sucked in and I love that kind of atmosphere. I think this film reminded me the most of Cloverfield. The monster designs had that kind of feeling to it, and it had a nice build-up to the monster reveal that is amazing. I won't spoil it, but the reveal of Godzilla gave me chills. The build-up really works. The whole film has a lot of build-up and suspense to it that really is great. Many scenes with the monsters are shot at night, but it is done quite well and you can see the monsters well, allowing the darkness to cover up anything that may look unrealistic in a day time scene. The score is also quite nice, and fits well with the the events that are occurring for the most part. I think an issue comes in with the concept of making it very heavily focused on character drama. I love that idea in theory, but it just doesn't come together in this as well as I would have liked it to. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't the greatest actor in my opinion, and it doesn't work having him as the lead. He gets the job done but it just could have been much better. Bryan Cranston gives a fairly good performance, but I can't help but feel like he wasn't 100% suited to the role, and maybe he was cast in that role just to bring in more people, since Breaking Bad was huge. Not that he doesn't do a good job, it just felt like something was missing at times. Also the movie felt a tad bit cheesier than it should have been at times. It takes a more realistic approach to the whole Godzilla idea but still includes silly stuff, but I think that's just the whole Hollywood blockbuster thing. I went into this wanting some fun and monster scenes that would give me chills, and it delivered. Godzilla is a really great summer film."

","Oh my god is all i could think while driving home today. Godzilla is directed by Gareth Edwards and stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. Godzilla is a film to experience only in theaters, you will not experience Godzilla the same on your TV, phone or computer. Disclosing the plot of the film would ruin the surprise and i would recommend you just see the film for yourself to find out. <br/><br/>The acting is amazing, with Bryan Cranston giving an incredible performance as the tortured father that will leave you riveted in every scene he's in. Ken Watanabe is also great in the film playing as the scientist. Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't as good as i would have liked him to be in the film, but he still did a pretty decent job as the son to Bryan Cranston. <br/><br/>The CGI and sound effects are on par with Jurassic Park and are probably the best thing about this film. The sound affects truly give Godzilla the roar he deserves. Every scene involving Godzilla is extremely well done. Gareth Edwards has done an amazing job at making you feel the weight of Godzilla's steps as he walks/ swims through anything in his way (it actually feels like your there). The CGI in the film is absolutely groundbreaking with very scene being extremely powerful as you watch huge skyscrapers and complete destruction of cites fall to the ground with ease. The lighting in the film is really dark and gives the viewer a sense of horror as literally god strikes down upon the world. <br/><br/>Godzilla is a must see movie experience that can only be experienced at the movies!. Although the acting could have been a little bit better than expected, it didn't deter from the main focus of the film to much which is obviously Godzilla. The CGI and special effects were also incredible and groundbreaking!. I would highly recommend you see Godzilla as soon as possible. ✭✭✭✭"
"curtiswberry","5","9","18","16 May 2014"," What a waste
","Godzilla followed a formula for building up the audience by teasing. It also kept the human connection to the story strong with the main family. If anyone expected Oscar-caliber acting in a monster flick should wake up.<br/><br/>What really ticked me off was that there was a total of perhaps 5 minutes of godzilla battling the other monsters. I wasn't expecting a start to finish flick with nothing but fighting, but come on. Once the fighting starts, I need more than a highlight reel, for God's sake. <br/><br/>The other thing that ticked me off how the director filmed the monster fight at night and with dust thick in the air. This kind of technique is what I'd expect from a movie with a low budget where they're trying to hide bad fx. As you'll see, when they *do* show clear shots of the monsters, the cgi was impeccable. So what were they thinking?<br/><br/>This movie was like teasing a hungry German shepher with a thick new york strip. When feeding time comes, you only give him enough bits and pieces to feed a parakeet.<br/><br/>Nice idea, bad execution."

","A great Hollywood adaption to the Godzilla legacy, and the only one we will speak of from now on *cough* 1998 *cough*.<br/><br/>i would first like to get one thing straight this is not PACIFIC RIM this would fall more under a category like suspense,drama,monster instead of the non-stop action of pacific rim. the action is closer to something like MAN OF STEEL or KING KONG with much more focus on the human storyline. though sometimes this doesn't work as well as intended<br/><br/>the director(Gareth Edwards) stated that he didn't want to over-saturate the audience with Godzilla(though there is still plenty of Godzilla/monster screen time) but instead build to a big finale. while the focus on the human character's works well in the first third because of good acting and the inclusion an interesting situation, it does cause it to slow a bit around the middle, this is because of a change in focus(the wait for Godzilla doesn't help)but doesn't completely die down with the occasional teases and building to the final third which is glorious.<br/><br/>also before seeing this, i thought the trailer had ruined it by showing the best bit's. instead nearly all of it turned out to be from the first 60mins and left plenty of surprises in the last half<br/><br/>i really liked this movie and how it stayed true to the Godzilla legacy, i would strongly recommend it to any one who like's the classics and is fine movie for any movie fan no matter what genre. just know going in that while some of the fight's may remind you of pacific rim it's pacing is more similar to king kong or man of steel but in the best possible way"
"ctowyi","5","9","18","15 May 2014"," Godzilla makes Pacific Rim feels like a masterpiece
","This is quite a visually stunning film - the huge vistas of mayhem and destruction is a young kid's wet dream. The stars of the film are definitely the monsters. Lots of money shots. That's it... for the nice stuff about it. <br/><br/>I couldn't wrap my head around the heavy-handed, joyless storytelling. What happened to B-grade fun? Why so serious?!? I think the only light spot is seeing a few firemen kicking down a Nevada hotel door to Elvis' Devil in Disguise, but I choked down my uneasy giggles because I doubt anybody in the cinema got it. IMHO the director, Gareth Edwards got the monster element gleefully down but completely neglected the human element. This is a shame because I thought his debut, Monsters (2010) was an outstandingly balanced drama and the fantastic. I have no doubt he got the ""Gojira"" job because of it. The humans here barely registered a presence beyond the crazy one, the screaming one, the gung-ho one, the running one, the brooding scientist that no one bothers with but still keeps around for some alternative voice. I find all the big-named characters very cardboard-y and lifeless. It also didn't help that the story is so fatiguing with so much overbearing self- importance. Comparing this to last year's Pacific Rim, it makes Pac Rim feels like a masterpiece."

","Damn, this film was amazing. It's pretty much everything I wanted it to be. It's not a typical monster flick. Nice plot, effective human drama and amazing action sequences make this a must-watch. Its dark tone works well and gives it the intensity it aims to achieve. When it comes to acting performances, Bryan Cranston deserves the most applause. Ken Watanabe is effective and Aaron Taylor- Johnson is just alright. The actresses are wasted, though. Anyway, this is definitely the best movie of the year so far. Officially one of my favorite monster films of all time. Looking forward to see it again!<br/><br/>P.S. If you're expecting a total CG fest like Pacific Rim or the Transformers films, then you're in for a big disappointment. This is so much more sophisticated. Sure, the action is great but (spoiler warning, I guess?) it takes almost an hour till Godzilla shows up. Director Gareth Edwards utilized slow build-up in order to tease his appearance and I liked that."
"JayEmm89","5","9","18","15 May 2014"," A movie that could have been great, made just passable
","I went into Godzilla not with earth-shattering expectations (I am not as fond of the director's previous film, Monsters, as most) but I hoped it would be better than Roland Emmerich's film (which I think I like more than most people).<br/><br/>The film had a good opening sequence, followed by some very heavy-handed and overly serious plot mostly featuring Bryan Cranston. The action soon gets picked up by his son, then goes to Ken Watanabe's character, then back and all over the place.<br/><br/>When the monster appeared and turned out to not be Godzilla, I have to say I was very excited - I thought this was going to be a great return to form for the series and I loved the idea of seeing Godzilla give the beating of a lifetime to another massive mutant.<br/><br/>Sadly, every time a conflict seemed about to start, the director cut away to something completely different. In fact, the film felt very disjointed as a whole, following several plot lines that didn't neatly intertwine and with a ""main"" character who seemed nearly incidental. Given the film's two hour plus runtime, only in the final five minutes do we actually get to see Godzilla do any fighting and by then it is over far too fast and is not as exciting as it should have been.<br/><br/>There are plenty of amazing ""moments"" in the film, some of which we've seen in the trailer, but it seems like the director just wanted to stitch all these moments together without any thought for the film as a whole. There seemed to be no sense of peril either, just a massive amount spent on CGI and special effects for ultimately a very unrewarding payoff. I much preferred Pacific Rim - as flawed as it was, that film delivered much more in terms of the headline draw of monster fights.<br/><br/>There could have been a great Godzilla movie here, but the opportunity was sadly missed."

It had everything you could have wanted in it: great fight scenes between the monsters with extremely realistic settings, explosions, and movements between the monsters, a great cast for the movie, and an amazing story that surprised me. But even with all of the perfections of the movie, there was a few flaws. For starters, I was lead to believe that Bryan Cranston would be the protagonist and Godzilla would be the antagonist. Bryan Cranston was hardly even a main character, seeing as he (SPOILER ALERT) died nearly 30 minutes into the movie, and Godzilla was not, in fact, the antagonist. For this movie, Godzilla stepped up to be (SPOILER ALERT) the savior of mankind. He didn't want to destroy Tokyo or New York in this movie; rather he was trying to protect us from the Mutus (I'm pretty sure that's what they were called). Maybe others didn't get that from the end, but when Godzilla went back into the sea after defeating them, it was a pretty clear sign that he was only protecting us. Either way, I'm totally giving this movie a 10."

I actually found it scary cause when the film was finished, the popcorn was all over me instead of my mouth. My heart was pumping. It was sad though that they killed off the Cranston actor early in the film. Waiting for the actual Godzilla monster took an hr, I timed it just in case it might be like Pompeii. Review here. Like we were waiting for almost 2 hrs, before the volcano erupted. So for the first hour, the film explained the plot of the whole film, which basically is as follows. The monster Godzilla came to be as a baby eating Radioactive. Something like that. He fed on that for the whole of his life. Now there's a bit of confusion on my part. In that I know about Godzilla, but 2 monsters also appeared apparently a Hubbie and Wifie. Godzilla towards the end of the movie, was actually a hero in that he was SAVING the citizens in that Godzilla kills the two other Monsters. I will have to clarify this as the times I go to see it, increases haha. The effects of the film excellent. The roars of the Monsters. oh boii. HOT DAWG. Highly recommended the film."

No matter what you imagine to see before entering this movie , it's not what you think at all. It's a new version of Godzilla , new take for the story in everything. Some will like this new version while others will definitely not. All I can say that Godzilla is well drawn , I like this design better than the previous one in 1997. It's HUGE really HUGE and it's voice is so beautiful and scary. The graphics and sound effects are amazing. There are two main problems with the movie that they could have handled better and it might made the audience much happier. First of all it's a Godzilla movie so we are expecting to only see Godzilla and it's destruction not people maybe if they are running for their lives or being killed we would watch them other than that we don't want it. Second one is the dialogue a lot of people in the movie and a lot of talking. All we ever needed is more Godzilla screening time in the movie and more fighting.

I've been a HUGE fan of Godzilla for as long as I can remember. I admit that the trailers especially early on were a bit misleading but that didn't stop me from loving the final product at all because what I got was a combination of everything that's great about the various Japanese movies.<br/><br/>There was a good feeling of terror throughout the movie with the conspiracy theories and the POV shots of the monsters. Even though this movie was not as dark as I'd expected it still got the point that what was happening was bad across and for me that's good enough. It was also campy like the later movies in the Japanese series without being cheesy.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston was definitely a big highlight in this movie I just wish he had been in it more. When Cranston was on screen though he completely stole every scene and at this point I'd expect nothing less from him. I also completely disagree with the complaints about ATJ I think he did a great job playing his role. I think he had great chemistry with his family and I think he did a good job doing exactly what he needed to do for this role.<br/><br/>I don't have much to say about the plot except for that it was fairly simple but did a great job paying tribute to the original while still putting a cool new twist on the origin of Godzilla.

The acting was a little bland, I'm not going to lie. Bryan Cranston did a great job, and it's possibly an Oscar worthy performance. But he doesn't get to act for long. Ken Watanabe did NOT deliver a strong performance but delivered one of the most important lines of the movie: ""Its name is... Godzilla.""

"Staffenburgen","7","10","21","18 May 2014"," Exactly What I Expected: A Competently Made Movie About A Giant Monster
","After first seeing a preview for Gareth Edward's reboot of Godzilla, I was fairly excited. With an obvious respect for the source material and capable lead actors (most notably Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe), this new installment seemed determined to do justice to the epic monster from the original Japanese tokusatsu films. Despite decidedly mixed reviews, I was still hoping for the best as I sat down a few hours ago to watch the film. <br/><br/>So, was it as good as I hoped it would be? No, but it was pretty much exactly what I expected; a competently made movie about a giant monster. The film did a lot of things right, and it definitely had a few missteps, but ultimately, the good far outweighed the bad in this summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>Let's start with the good. Most importantly, the enormous eponymous kaiju actually looks like Godzilla. This beast is definitely nothing like the 1998 incarnation. Furthermore, every scene with Godzilla on screen is absolutely electric. He demands your attention; his humongous stature and deafening roars radiate energy, and provide far more excitement than any other CGI creation I've seen in recent blockbusters. I also really enjoyed Bryan Cranston's role. In the short time he had on screen, he effectively added a human element to a story that otherwise focused on fairly one-dimensional monsters. The pacing of the movie is also excellent, slowly building tension and teasing the audience with brief monster appearances before releasing all of the built-up energy in an explosive and electrifying climax. Although the final fight is a little lengthy and predictable, the cinematography was masterful. The massive billowing clouds of smoke surrounding the fight served as an interesting backdrop, and also allowed for frequent breaks in the action as the monsters weaved in and out of the audience's sight.<br/><br/>And now, the bad. Aside from Bryan Cranston, the human characters are very one-dimensional. This is a little disappointing, and it definitely detracted from the film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson struck me as particularly static. His character's story arc simply didn't resonate with me; we've all seen that story countless times before. That being said, the film needed a solid hero to bring the audience closer to the action, and in that regard, he definitely succeeded. Aside from this, my only other criticism is of the MUTO's, which are the monsters that oppose Godzilla in the film. Given the vast array of classic monsters in the series, such as Mothra, Destoroyah, and King Ghidorah, I would've preferred a more interesting antagonist. Of course, the MUTO's serve exactly the same purpose as these other monsters, they just aren't nearly as awesome. <br/><br/>Put simply, this film is better than most monster movies I have seen in recent memory. Most importantly, it doesn't fall into the trap that countless blockbusters have fallen for in recent years. In this film, the CGI augments the story, it doesn't replace it. Yes, the film provides the audience with massive monsters, but it doesn't let these beasts dominate every scene. Instead, it carefully works them in, and saves the all-important massive fight for the climax. By using this approach, the film was able to preserve the awesome energy of Godzilla throughout the entirety of the film, and never let the monster become saturated and boring. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie. I think the reason that many others haven't enjoyed it as much as I did is because of false expectations, on two separate fronts. First, do not expect this movie to be a flat-out action movie. The film is equal parts drama and action, and I think this surprised and bored a lot of people in the audience. Second, don't expect it to be groundbreaking, as many others seem to have done. Instead, expect a competently made movie about a giant monster. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>RATING: 7/10"

Don't get me wrong I liked it very much, but I can't deny it being a kind of disappointment. Talking about positives there are many things that could be pointed to: no one in their right mind would dare say this movie looks bad. Everything here is visually stunning, even the small-scale scenes are wonderful to witness and Godzilla and his fellow monsters felt very real, detailed and most certainly looked beautiful. Seamus McGarvey is a really special cinematographer. The cgi department here did a truly breathtaking job, even if there were a couple of shots that made me go ""huh that one was cg"", it is rare for a movie to have the quality special effects you find here. The film also feels very organized and grounded, so from a visual point of view there is lots of continuity. Credit to all of the actors too for making their roles perfectly believable, Bryan Cranston is definitely the highlight here the fact that he isn't in it enough actually detracted a lot of emotion. All in all there's just no way for someone to not have fun or be thrilled here: the money is spectacularly spent in amazing action scenes, add Godzilla and other monsters there and you'll only be excited by it. Quick shout-out to Alexander Desplat and his genius, with this he demonstrates himself as a very versatile composer and pays off with a riveting score. Where this movie fails is in drama and story continuity: on the first point there are small sparkles of interesting character moments, but on the wide scope there isn't enough for getting me attached to the people involved and this is probably due to some wasted time in the first act introducing the characters in very clichéd way (the time feels wasted also because the movie is 10-15 minutes too long) and to the continuous repetition of coincidences and situations that at some point I just gave up on. Talking about repetitions a minor problem I had with the movie, but kind of got on my nerves the more I saw it, was that the action scenes feel always the same in their introduction, they are all opened in the same style and other that being it a kind of clichéd style it was used for two hours and it really bothered me: the action scenes themselves are awesome, but it's the way in which they are introduced that I had a problem with. To the major fault of the movie: the story just did not flow spontaneously enough. There were way too many time where I asked myself: ""but what about that?"" ""oh yea? and where's that been the whole time"" and I went ""Really?"" so dam frequently. An example is when Godzilla (minor spoiler) breathes ""fire"", it was so out of nothing I simply didn't believe in it. Sure it is a iconic characteristic about the monster, but use it wisely or don't use it at all: it felt like a wink to the viewer that ended up being only annoying. Plus, I never fully understood the dynamics of the monsters, it always felt like the logic in it was about to fall a part. The character of Godzilla itself didn't really make much sense. He didn't bother with humans even if they tried to kill him, twice, but then he just leaves them. Very confusing. I don't declare myself a Godzilla fan at all, so I don't know if there's anything behind there, but it could have been easily addressed. Generally the problems I have with the movie are nit-pick, but when it becomes repetitive to a point of stress you loose me, nevertheless the direction was strong and the film was great fun."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","6","11","5 June 2014"," Reinventing the giant monster movie
","Before now, Godzilla was a giant dino-lizard, a punchline, a D-list movie monster. Now, in Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla,"" he is a god, the alpha predator, a force of nature. Warner Bros.' has not only crafted an exhilarating ""Godzilla"" movie here, it has pulled an incredible P.R. move, transforming a brand last known for having Matthew Broderick as its spokesperson.<br/><br/>David Callaham, writer of ""The Expendables,"" and Max Borenstein have grounded this version of ""Godzilla"" in historical fiction. Nuclear tests in the '50s were not tests but an attempt to destroy Godzilla, a last remaining vestige of prehistoric times. They also ground the film in characters, taking a lengthy amount of time to tell the story of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). These characters both humanize the story and get us in close to the main plot.<br/><br/>First we are taken back to 1999. Joe and his wife (Juliette Binoche) work for a nuclear power plant in Japan. Increases in seismic activity worry Joe, yet his superiors refuse to shut the plant down. When a spike in these electromagnetic pulses causes a nuclear breach that eventually destroys the city, Joe loses his wife. In the present, Joe has become crazed attempting to find answers. Ford, his son, an explosives expert in the Navy, reconnects with him when he must leave his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son to go bail his father out of jail. Joe eventually convinces his son to go back with him to their old Japanese town and discover what the governments of the world are hiding there. Turns out the pulses are happening again.<br/><br/>What results this time is the release of a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that begins to wreak havoc as it moves across the Pacific. As the military creates an action plan, a Japanese researcher (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant (Sally Hawkins) draw upon what they've learned from Joe and Ford and theorize that Godzilla could be their only hope, the alpha predator looking to restore order to the food chain.<br/><br/>Painting Godzilla as an ambiguous ""good guy"" we know little about works to the film's advantage and suits Edwards' style quite well. Edwards' indie monster flick (titled ""Monsters"") expertly created mystery, fear and awe around its monsters and Edwards does the same for Godzilla and the MUTOs (that's right, there are two). He captures the same sense of scale that Guillermo del Toro did in last summer's ""Pacific Rim"" and there's little doubt the master monster-making filmmaker would praise this effort.<br/><br/>Edwards works a nice balance of teasing us with the presence of these creatures and giving us solid glimpses, walking the line of monster blockbuster and monster art film. He prefers shots that keep the human characters involved or come from their perspective so we not only get a sense for just how big and terrifying the creatures are, but we also feed off the raw energy of the actors' performances. Taylor-Johnson has been a leading man before, but he gets a lot thrown at him in this movie and makes it all work. Somehow (conveniently) he constantly finds himself in the monsters' warpath and it keeps things interesting.<br/><br/>Multiple monsters also proves essential to the entertainment factor of ""Godzilla."" Yes, monsters fighting is enormously more delightful than a single monster leveling buildings, but it also gives us something to watch for as an audience to keep the wheels turning. Ultimately, this drives our interest in the film; not what happens to the human characters, who serve as a moderately compelling excuse for us to ""get in"" on the action. <br/><br/>The resulting effect is that we get a Godzilla who is not just the big scary monster terrorizing the city, but an elusive creature driven by biological impulse, an ""X"" factor and one that we can root for. That's how it should be. ""Godzilla"" doesn't have to belong in the horror-action genre; he can be part of a supernatural action thriller. Godzilla also doesn't have to be the entire focus of the movie. Joe and Ford's story centers around what's going on with the MUTO, and Godzilla just sort of jumps in.<br/><br/>Urban carnage is the theme du jour for blockbusters, so what Warner Bros. and Edwards have done with this new ""Godzilla"" isn't trend-shattering, but they've taken great care to their approach with reinventing a giant monster movie for a modern audience. They also don't assume that the people most interested in seeing a giant monster movie lack the sophistication to appreciate a little artistic nuance and thoughtful storytelling.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"adamtrz","6","6","11","5 June 2014"," Wait... Was that a Godzilla film?
","This film was awesome, the fighting kicked ass, the writing was solid, and the acting was emotionally strong throughout... But I walked out of the theatre thinking I watched something other than a film about Godzilla. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Godzilla himself looked great, one of the best examples of CGI this year to be honest (except for the weird reptilian smile he had going on), but I wish there was more of him. If I could I would rename the movie to 'Giant Slimy Moths' because they seemingly got more screen time than Godzilla itself. Other than that timing issue (and Godzilla looking a little on the chubby side) the visuals where seamless and a joy to watch. <br/><br/>Immediately after the casting was released everyone was pumped for 'Breaking Bad' star Brian Cranston to play the role of a nuclear engineer living in Japan, and the hype was defiantly lived up to. Cranston truly can act and that really is shown in the beginning of this film, which is where he shines most. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character of some kind of super soldier really showed his talent towards the end but I'm sorry to say, didn't really excite me too much anywhere else (I still can't see him as anything else other than comic book nerd turned super-nerd). And lastly Elizabeth Olsen probably impressed me the most with her convincing portrayal of an emotionally lost, but strong and independent woman.<br/><br/>Even if you don't enjoy action, go for the music because the soundtrack resurrected goosebumps all around my body and, not to be clique, sent shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>As far as reboots go this film is up there in the stars, or maybe just above sea level, you'll have to watch it yourself to determine that. But it's an enjoyable movie with a fun sci-fi twist (kind of). 7.9 stars out of 10<br/><br/>This review was originally from my blog: www.Adam-Trzcinski.blogger.com"

"shakilurrahman77","8","6","11","3 June 2014"," Godzilla's back!!!
","The movie starts out with an interesting opening credits and Godzilla theme. Already, my Godzilla hype had begun. The heartbreaking opening was an interesting direction for a movie that had seemed to ignore that storyline completely, and a little waste of Cranston if you ask me. However the movie picked up quickly, and boy was it a fun ride! The visuals were just amazing to watch. The 3D isn't necessary but if you have a few bucks, go ahead. The human element as read by previous reviews, did indeed lack. The biggest peeve I had about the movie was that the big man himself (Godzilla) didn't show up until the last about half an hour and the teasings of him only made it excruciating to wait. When Godzilla came, my mind was blown by awesomeness. It made my insides into that of a 5-year old. Anyway in the end I give it a 8/10 and I would recommend you to watch it and if you can, in Imax 3D."
"BCritical","6","6","11","2 June 2014"," A Non-Spoiler Review
","Godzilla (2014) directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters) seemed like a very suitable choice in directing the Hollywood reboot. I watched Monsters and I thought it was kind of clever by establishing the creatures as background characters, that made them more mysterious in nature, but I don't think it works the same in a movie like this, because Godzilla has been an established character for nearly 60 years. Gareth Edwards had gone on to mention in several interviews that much of the direction of the movie had been influenced by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), building up Godzilla before his actual appearance and only showing glimpses of the creature before the final showdown. I felt the way it was handled only ended up hindering the overall experience. A lot of the screen time focused more on the human's like Monsters, but unlike Monsters, the characters were just not as interesting to follow. I felt as if the movie intentionally had starved us into being more appreciative of when Godzilla had appeared, to give us the impression that it was more exciting than it should be. Jaws had done the same, but there was an intensity behind it, not knowing where it was or when it would strike next. It's not a must-see, but it's something to watch if you have nothing better to do, just don't go expecting something deep like the trailers and a few people on this board seem to suggest. It is what it is."

","Being a fan of monster movies i always go into these films with high hopes. sometimes i walk out of the cinema expectedly disappointed and sometimes i walk out feeling satisfied. Godzilla i immediately got hyped for because i was dying to see if it could be worse than the Roland Emmerich one. but after seeing the first trailer i was intensely surprised at the first 20 seconds of that trailer.<br/><br/>i went into this movie really exited and of course the outcome wasn't what i wanted but what i knew it would be. i'm not saying that i predicted the ending i mean that i thought the movie looked good but i wasn't expecting ""the greatest movie of the year"" type thing because the film clearly is not.<br/><br/>first of all i will say that the cast of the movie is great but my only casting problem was Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Not that i am saying he's a bad actor i think he's a great actor but his character was just an emotionless statue. from the start of the movie i was seeing a lot of emotional entanglement with Brian Cranston but that's where i got my biggest disappointment of the movie. after we get through his great performance he gets killed about a half hour in and that really disappointed me because he was doing such a great job at solving this mystery but even when he gets killed his own son is barley showing any emotion at all. i will say i liked Kim Wantanabe's character but i didn't like his acting. every scene he appears in he has the exact same expression on his face i am being serious, nearly every scene.<br/><br/>but onto what everyone is talking about in this movie, Godzilla. the biggest complaint i have heard is that Godzilla is hidden from you but i was glad that they were keeping Godzilla away for a while because i didn't want them to just be throwing huge monster fights on screen, no you can leave that to Pacific Rim. if you were getting the big monster fight from the mid section of the movie there would be nothing to look forward to at the end and the wait is worth it because of the climax of the Mutos life.<br/><br/>the build up and tensity of this movie i really loved, people keep complaining they kept hiding Godzilla but surly you are enjoying these big Mutos that pretty much look like a cross between Clover and the Arachnids from starship troopers.<br/><br/>all and all i would say that Godzilla is a very enjoyable movie the build up is great, the fights are great, the monsters look fantastic and probably only but biggest let down was the characters."
"rjsf96","5","6","11","26 May 2014"," The Monster Mash
","Summer Popcorn Fare. These are the words that spring to mind when I think about Godzilla in retrospect. When I left the cinema (I saw this film in IMAX), I was quite pleased with the overall product. Of course it is better than Roland Emmerich's 1998 incarnation; you only have to look at the trailers and even the posters to know that much is true. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards directs the film smoothly with the appropriate tension that is needed to propel the action scenes forward. Edwards reveals Godzilla slowly and carefully, it is only in the second half that we witness it in all its enormous, scaly glory. This is a director that knows exactly what he is doing and has a complete vision that he is carrying towards the audience. The film however is a completely different beast than that of last year's Pacific Rim. Which was loud, big and brash, not that I have any problems with that. Many audience members may want to know this fact before hand. <br/><br/>Although there are several great action set pieces; one on a train is a highlight with a monster trying to kill as many people as possible, if you can overlook the other elements you may find excitement. Also, look out for a fight between Godzilla and the other monster, which is reminiscent of King Kong taking on a T-Rex. The action set pieces overall are few and far between until the last half hour or so. This is a criticism of many Hollywood blockbusters and does not reflect on just Godzilla at all. The film itself is well paced up until this point, it almost feels like the director felt obliged to put them there, just in case audiences felt shortchanged.<br/><br/>When it comes to drama to propel the plot and story forward, the film trips itself up and in a big way. This is sad to see because underneath all the dramatic elements here is a film that had the potential to be an epic, in terms of its scale, story and dramatic tension. Possibly the last and most important element is lacking and that is why I feel disappointed.<br/><br/>Though thought has gone into the film, the irony is that about an hour or so after seeing the film the initial buzz seemed to wear out and I did indeed feel shortchanged, but not for the reasons one might think. When you view Godzilla in the IMAX format your brain seems like it has been left at home. The reason I feel this way is that unfortunately this feels in far too many ways similar to another film that I would term – Summer Popcorn Fare. Sadly it is a film that was released seven years ago. You guessed correctly – Transformers, and Michael Bay directed that film. Bay made the dramatic elements laughable at best – with no relatable characters and this is exactly how I felt about this film. The characters seem more like caricatures then anything else, limp, and lifeless, without any joy or depth. They seem to have just had bullet points listed as their traits in the pre production process. Sadly it seems little has changed from that point. Take the character of Aaron Taylor Johnson, he resembles the all action, relatable hero or is supposed to, films like Die Hard have done this much better which is annoying. With a monster film you need relatable heroes and this film is completely devoid of them.<br/><br/>The fact is Godzilla takes itself way too seriously for me to enjoy and indulge in it. The concept of a huge monster roaming around a city is laughable at best, a true Director would know that the concept is ludicrous and needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Brighten the atmosphere, stop making it as serious as The Dark Knight and lighten up! Almost every character seems extremely sad at some point in this film. Am I the only one that would laugh myself silly when Godzilla attacks? Probably. Even so a few jokes and hints that this is stupid would make it more enjoyable without entering the realm of Camp.<br/><br/>It is my sad duty to report what could have been an enjoyable, exciting entry in the franchise is not so much Godzilla's roar as a colossal bore. The clichéd cardboard characters and dull script do not help matters and the set pieces cannot elevate this film from being a mediocre entry. For much better monster epics see the nearly decade old King Kong. You'll find much more joy watching it for the tenth time, than watching Godzilla for the first. If a sequel really is on the cards then Edwards get yourself a new screenwriter."
"xcvb_2003","8","6","11","25 May 2014"," Best cinematic experience of my life in terms of EPICNESS.
","I was very young when I watched Godzilla (1998) and love it back then. In fact, it was one of my favourite movie of that time. Sure, I watched it again recently and it was no where near as good as it was in my memory but that didn't change my love for Godzilla. 16 years later, they released this movie and I was unbelievably HYPED UP for it. I had to wait 8-9 days since it's release to watch and during that time, I saw a lot of hate towards it. Lots of negative reviews, with most of them focusing on about Godzilla's way too less screen time, movie being boring and not many fights. IT got me worried. And to top it off, I watched it after X-men Days of future past, which was an excellent movie. But thankfully, GODZILLA DELIVERED!!<br/><br/>The story wasn't anything outstanding, but it was good enough in my opinion and served well for the movie. It has some undertones like Nature restoring order, Man vs Nature etc which I liked. <br/><br/>The movie has a more serious tone overall, no lame ass humor thankfully. It is also a slow burner, not your typical big budget block buster movie. And if you go in hoping for a Godzilla vs Monster mash or lots of fighting, destruction in a fast paced way like Pacific Rim or Transformers type movies, you will surely be disappointed. It is more akin to old classic monster movies, with lots of teasing and build up. And Gareth Edwards (The Director) delivered on that front masterfully. Sure, the movie feels slow during the first 20-30 mins and you don't really see THE BIG G for about an hour into the movie but the slow build up was DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I can't really describe how awesome it felt when Godzilla finally surfaced and we slowly get to see him in all his GLORY. My heart rate was unbelievably high. SO MUCH EPICNESS. <br/><br/>This movie easily redefines the word EPIC. And that is thanks to the amazing camera work/cinematography and directing. Many of the shots are through POV and you get to really feel the huge scale. It was majestic. It was like the director just wanted you to soak in all the Epicness and scale of the moment. Soundtrack drops, eerie silence and all you can see is Godzilla or the other monsters and hear the rumbling of their presence. The amount of truly epic scenes in this movie is seriously too damn high. Sure, many of them don't involve Godzilla vs other monsters but I didn't care. <br/><br/>Monster vs Monster action really doesn't get going until the finale as they tease it throughout the movie, but BOY what an amazing finale it was. UFFFF it was OOOZING with EPICNESS. People actually clapped and cheered during some scenes, which I haven't witnessed in quite some time now. The other creatures, M.U.T.Os (Massive unidentified terrestrial organism), weren't pushovers. They gave Big G one hell of a tough time. <br/><br/>The CGI was amazing. The destruction, the MUTOs and Godzilla all looked great. Loved Godzilla's design. He is HUGE (not FAT) and mean looking. The MUTOs are creepy good. They gave them emotions too which was a great touch.<br/><br/>Soundtrack was surprisingly refreshing. It felt like those old monster movies soundtrack which I actually don't really like. But somehow it really worked with the scenes in this movie. Also, that creepy chant or whatever soundtrack from 2001: A space odyssey was also used in the movie during some truly epic scenes and it made them EVEN MORE EPIC.<br/><br/>This movie is not without flaws though. The human characters either weren't really interesting or the movie was so EPIC that it made them insignificant. :p Well aside from Bryan Cranston that is, who I thought was great. BUT he got very little screen time, which was a huge letdown. The scientist, military general, the family, all the clichéd characters that you see in such monster or destruction type movies were all present. There were some cheesy/cliché scenes too which you get with such movies. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say that it is without a doubt THE BEST CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE in terms of EPICNESS. I have never been so BLOW AWAY during some scenes like I was in this movie. I really don't get majority of the hate. Even with its flaws, the EPICNESS far far outweighs it. And if there ever was a movie that was meant to be seen in a cinema, this would be it.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"goldimari","7","6","11","24 May 2014"," Return of the King
","Godzilla is a familiar IP to me, like many others I grew up watching practically all of the Toho Godzilla films and was enamored by the spectacle of giant monsters fighting each other. Luckily this new American Godzilla production keeps the spirit of the original which is something that is a welcomed taste cleanser after the 1998 U.S film that left so many fans with disdain. This new film has a solid cast with Bryan Cranston carrying most of the emotional weight of the film. The design of Godzilla is great and keeps true to the Toho one but has been updated to make Godzilla structurally sound as a giant creature that could support itself. The monster fight scenes brought out the kid in me and did a good job of showing off the monster's scale in size, although these scenes are often cut short or viewed through a small television in the background. Though the majority of the characters are not too interesting and people may have a problem with the film's pacing I'd still say that this is an enjoyable film and appreciate the director and writers efforts to understand what the essence of Godzilla is about."
"pcrprimer","8","6","11","17 May 2014"," Destructive action with monsters that have weight
","Godzilla is clearly the main character of this movie, which is a welcome change from 1990s Godzilla version. Although you don't see much of Godzilla, there is a big payoff with the climax. The movie had a much darker atmosphere that was reminiscent of War of the Worlds with a lot of ash and grey skies. The Halo jump scene had a gritty sense of realism that was one of the standout scenes. I also liked how the movie didn't mimic King Kong in one of the major scenes, when it could have easily done so. Rather it handled that scene in a much more enjoyable manner. A minor criticism of this movie was that the rest of the acting was not up to par of Cranston. Other parts of it, like the train scene, felt very reminiscent of Battle LA."
"sreethered","6","6","11","17 May 2014"," The Alpha Primate Ultimatum...
","I had been a fan of Godzilla ever since I watched the 1998 movie. Don't get me wrong, I was then 6 years old and it was one of the very few Hollywood movies that released at my place. After 10 years, when I had a second watch of 1998 Godzilla, I understood why it was panned so deeply. Still, that movie made me research through the Godzilla mythology and I was pretty much impressed. That's why I visited the movies for this 2014 take on the Alpha Primate. I must say, as a movie fan I'm not quite satisfied with it, but as a classic Godzilla fan, it was more than merry. <br/><br/>The technical side is the most note-worthy on this take, since the creature design was so much rooted with the 1950 classic. The scenes which depicts the menace of Godzilla was nearly breath-taking, and the roar was something special. The design of MUTOs were also appreciable, and the CGI works and 3-D effects are also passable. At least, the 3-D didn't made me scratch my head.<br/><br/>Considering the story side, it was a weak script, though pretty strong for a disaster movie. It wasn't a throughout smack-smash, or a 2-hour collision of the giants, but had a good human point-of-view over the subject, which takes me to the weak point of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting section wasn't that bright. It had a good platform for the actors even though the concentration was on the monster. Bryan Cranston proved it with his charismatic performance. He didn't had a major part on the screen, but was a core element on the script and with the high-voltage sentiments and rage he portrayed the lone crusader for truth brilliantly. Sad thing was, nobody, including Aron-Taylor Johnson and Ken Watanabe, was that much competing. It made me to long for the creature sequences more. But considering the script and the director's intentions, the final product is an adequate one to pass both fans and casual users.<br/><br/>As a final note, Godzilla is a classic incarnation of Gojira movies with appropriate human emotions. If you are a classic Gojira fan, never miss it. If you are a movie-goer who likes movies with a strong mythology, go give it a try........."
"geo-evans265","8","6","11","15 May 2014"," Long Live the King of all Monsters!
","The movie has delivered to its original roots like it did from 1954. The monsters fighting scene, included the effects of CGI, were indeed outstanding - as if they were real! Our King's roar does shake the whole theater as it was like the whole building was about to collapse! I actually got scared TWICE - Once from the MUTO hatching scene, and the other was... I cannot even remember! GAH! But, those scenes actually got me good! <br/><br/>The reason why I gave the score 8/10 is because the lack of human characteristics as it's rather dull - Bryan Cranston did a wonderful and excellent job, he's an awesome actor and I give credit for delivering a powerful feel about the movie; As for the rest, they need to add a bit more of 'Umph!' into the movie or even more screen time? Godzilla, on the other hand, has more feel and made me think He was a real creature - He is indeed The reborn and King of all Monsters as how he has shown and battled against the MUTOs. In the end, I actually felt quite sympathetic and empathetic to those the characters who were going through all the havoc causes by the forces of nature. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was both epic and awesome! I do hope it'll make a big hit in its home country this coming July. I am going to watch it in the theater again, twice, as this is one of those films you'd watch more than just one time!"

","I never really write anything about films I've seen. I walked out of The Spirit and had to sit through the hell that was Apollo 18 so I've seen some crap in my time.<br/><br/>I went into Godzilla thinking it would wipe the floor with the 90s Hollywood version. Im not a big old school Godzilla fan, never seen any of the Japanese films so I cant really compare but I will mention a few things that, for me, made this film crap in my view.<br/><br/>1. The bomb that they set up and then tried to disarm. I distinctly remember hearing them say ""remember the bomb that went off back in the 40s, well this one will make that look like a firecracker"". On hearing that I assumed, if this bomb blows up, its gonna be huge. It did blow up....about half a mile from the helicopter that saved the main character..... no one seemed to be affected by this massive nuclear explosion.<br/><br/>2. The actors. The main Character was heroically, less believable than if they had Rowan Atkinson take the role and use his Mr Bean persona. You had no connection with any of the characters, except for his father in the first 30 odd minutes of the film, who dies soon after.<br/><br/>3. Humour. There was no humour in this film. It was played straight all the way through. This film is about a nuclear powered giant lizard hat rises from the ocean to save mankind as it is being attacked by 2 giant bugs. Yet the whole film is so serious, i felt depressed after it. <br/><br/>4. I know people are moaning about Godzilla only really having about 10 -15 mins proper screen time and, to be fair, I have to agree. The film is called Godzilla, not ""The guy from Kick Ass"". People say its to build tension....but why? We have all seen Godzilla before, if not in the old Japanese films, at least the 90s Hollywood version, so there is no tension to build. We know what he looks like and know what he is, we know his back story so why not have him do something we haven't seen before (in a Hollywood version anyway) like have him destroy cities as he fights monsters for most of the film. But then that's partly due to problem 3, too serious.<br/><br/>The only thing have to say is that the CGI is brilliant, ill say that for it. Other than that, if you want to see massive monsters fighting and destroying cities......and i cant believe I'm saying this.......watch pacific rim."
"papermonkey11","10","8","16","18 May 2014"," A thrilling and exhilarating movie experience
","This greatly thematic movie takes me back to the original Gojira-era films. From the appearance of the great lizardy f(r)iend, to the transformery/decepticony enemies of the mankind (i.e. giant mosquito-grasshoppers) and the old school slo-mo ""Don't tell me that there is that a giant Godzilla behind me"" looks of despair.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston gives a top notch performance and makes me believe he really cares about his wife dying from radiation, and that he feels responsible. Something no one else in the movie seems to be capable of doing professionally. <br/><br/>While the protagonists seem to care about each other, they don't really tend to show it. Well, OK, maybe I'm generalising a little. Elizabeth Olsen produces a fine result of portraying someone in dire need of help in all the scenes where Godzilla is (kindly) smashing San Francisco. Even though her character does say she will stay behind to help, I can't really put my finger on the reason. I mean, If three ultra-giant monsters are smashing your city like Andre the Giant in a lego town, how much help can you really be?<br/><br/>Anyhow, her characters emotional state is as deep as the Mariana Trench when compared to the fantastic Taylor-Johnson's character. I was getting mixed signals from him from the very start. So, he comes back home after 14 months of being away, gives his son a pat on the head, starts kissing his wife and the has to fly to Japan to give his father a ""get out of jail free"" card. I mean, OK, I guess I understand, but I would be really mad at him, since this was not the first time he's done it.<br/><br/>We learn that ""crazy""-Cranston, has been at this for 15 (if I remember correctly) years. BUT, he still maintains enough influence over his (apparently) dim-witted son to persuade him with a talk about echo-sound-communications? Ah well, naivety at its finest.<br/><br/>But, this is not the main problem of the film. The apparent lack of interest from any political leader in the world about the giant ancient monster-gods is a little bit weird. I mean, the only one seeming responsible is the commander of a aircraft carrier? (To be honest, he does pick up a red phone at some point).<br/><br/>But enough of the movie-bashing. I really felt for the portrayal of Godzilla. I really liked the whole misunderstood, friendly Iron-giant type figure. Yes, he is an ancient alpha-predator that feeds of the radiation of the Earth core. Yes, he does create tsunamis when he emerges (oops!) to save the puny humans he might later trample.<br/><br/>But by all that is good and true, even when an enormous building falls down upon him, even when he has used his super-sayan blue-flame radiation-filled breath on the giant bug thing, he still has the strength to give a ""I hope I did a good job soldier!"" look to the main representative of the armed forces. Uncle Sam would be proud of you Godzilla. And the he would probably sue you for damages.<br/><br/>10/10 would re-watch just to see the best ""omg I can't believe I have one facial expression in this movie"" face by Ken Watanabe, portraying the I'm-always-at-a-loss doctor."

Folks please don't believe in the paid reviews some people write about the movie. Godzilla is an Harassment"
"WeeClaude","3","8","16","18 May 2014"," Dull, ponderous and inferior to 90% of the Japanese series
","I've come out of IMDb retirement just to write about how bad this movie is. I simply can't believe that so much of the advance hype about ""Godzilla"" was positive. To me, this movie is a near-total dud, both for casual filmgoers and *especially* for longtime fans of Toho's Godzilla series.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with it? Apart from a solid setup in the first 20 minutes...practically everything. Perhaps the biggest sin is that wonderful actors such as Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche and Sally Hawkins are given tiny, do-nothing parts. (Binoche's small role is particularly insulting; you'd hardly recognize her as the powerful star of ""Three Colors: Blue."") Most of the screen time is taken up by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, both of whom give absolutely dreadful performances. And the bit-part actors are even worse!<br/><br/>As for Godzilla...he isn't even in the movie. Well, okay, that's not quite true. His back spines protrude from the ocean a few times. And the rest of his clumsy/ugly CGI redesign shows up for...gee, I dunno...five minutes total? To make matters worse, the special effects scenes mostly take place at night; so the vast majority of the Godzilla footage is dark, murky and hard to watch. Yo, the old man-in-a-suit Godzilla may have been cheesy, but at least he was visible! And as for Godzilla's atomic breath...it looked way cooler 13 years ago, in ""GMK.""<br/><br/>In place of Godzilla, we see a lot of the MUTOs, two of his most boring opponents ever. One looks like Gyaos from the Gamera movies; the other is clearly just a blown-up version of a ""Starship Troopers"" bug (who thought there was any nostalgia for *that* movie?!) Neither monster has any personality or real screen presence. <br/><br/>And what exactly are these creatures supposed to represent? The script makes some half- hearted references to things like 9/11 and the Fukushima disaster, but at no point did I feel that the MUTOs reflected these events in an interesting way. By contrast, the original 1954 Godzilla film really feels like a valuable social commentary on life in the atomic age. This movie? It's not commenting on anything, not in any real sense. It nods in the general direction of relevance, but that's it.<br/><br/>So what we have here is a film that drags...a film with no real message...a film with almost no Godzilla...a film with barely any Bryan Cranston. What on Earth were they thinking? Make no mistake, this is a standard Hollywood hack job, with all the hallmarks of other bad action movies: superficial family relationships, nauseating sentimentality, confused plotting and total disrespect for its source material. Despite the director's lofty claims, it's not a faithful Godzilla movie at all - and it ain't a worthy successor to ""Jaws"" or ""Jurassic Park"" either.<br/><br/>Though they're far from perfect, I think the Marvel superhero movies do a far better job of capturing the innocent joy of comic books, than this movie does of capturing the innocent joy of a Godzilla monster mash. In fact, there's no joy at all here, just a lot of dingy photography and self-conscious efforts to ""elevate"" the material. Oy vey. Somebody put on ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"" instead! It's more fun, and in some respects, it even has better special effects."
"richmopapi","10","8","16","18 May 2014"," An Honest Godzilla Review
","I saw Godzilla today and let me tell you, I was completely BLOWN AWAY. Not just because it was a Monster Movie Epic,But also because of just how negative and false the reviews were from some of the films critics. Let me start off by saying I am a Godzilla fan and have never seen a Godzilla movie that shows off the King of Monsters so well. Many critics write negative reviews just so people will read theirs and be filled with so many negative thoughts before heading in to watch the film themselves. I walked in with some doubt, and walked out in complete and utter shock as to just how well done the film was! Gareth Edwards took Godzilla and did what many films before this couldn't, He made us care about the characters around the King. With the older films I noticed something. I like many others only wanted to see Godzilla and had no care for the human characters. Gareth took time to carefully and fully develop each character and make you care for them unlike many of the films predecessors. Edwards also does a fantastic job at giving Godzilla emotion and a sense of connection throughout the movie. You really feel for Godzilla in the end and this is something all Monster movies should strive for. Contrary to what many critics say, You actually see Godzilla Quite a lot, and the movie is anything but boring. I often times found myself wide eyed, mouth wide open in pure amazement to what I was witnessing. This movie gave me hope and respect for all Edwards has achieved with this beautiful film and can achieve in the future of Godzilla. So, to those hesitant about seeing this film in theaters, please go and enjoy. I can promise you will never see a Monster movie as well told and played out as Godzilla. I look forward to experiencing Godzilla again in theaters, and oh boy what an experience it was!"
"adams-400","10","8","16","18 May 2014"," Fine addition to the franchise
","It's hard to believe but Hollywood may have finally gotten it right. Cultural continuity within the genera is a must. Of course the wealth of Japanese and other Asian actors as well as typical Japanese home, street & cityscape scenes lent much to this film's Japanese feel. Something Hollywood missed in previous attempts at kaiju eiga.<br/><br/>Godzilla was faithfully reproduced in all his splendor, scales and ear shattering roar with only minor variances that can be found throughout the Japanese based films. Thank heaven the film makers didn't try to re-invent the basic concept of what constitutes Godzilla. While I do miss the original Godzilla roar this version is satisfying enough.<br/><br/>The conflicts of interest as illustrated within the movie between monster VS monster, monster VS humans, human VS human and human VS force of nature all mesh with the Japanese naturalist philosophy and in doing so add to the sense of continuity with the Japanese produced body of kaiju films.<br/><br/>I didn't find the strictly contemporary US cultural aspects of the film very beneficial to its atmosphere, more of a clash of venue or even a distraction than a cultural expansion. Perhaps the kaiju eiga venue is too deeply rooted in Japanese mythos & culture to permit too many non-Japanese cultural aspects without adulterating the basic concept too much.<br/><br/>The story is action packed, suspenseful, exciting, full of plot twists and aligned with basic Godzilla canon. The male protagonist's ongoing ""nine-lives"" survival of multiple disasters does wear a bit thin but is also consistent with Godzilla lore.<br/><br/>All in all a satisfying addition to the franchise with future potential. I look forward to adding it to my collection when released on disk."

There's already s lot of emotions from the start, and emotions keep soaring high as soldiers valiantly fight the epic battle that never seem to end. The visual effects are jaw dropping and awe inspiring.

","After long years of absence, the world's most famous monster reptile breathes its radioactive fire anew on the big screen.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards' version of Godzilla vaunts a stellar ensemble of powerhouse cast and extravagant CGI-effects. Edwards attempts to cruise through creature and disaster features of the film. That take shines on the film's small and delicate moments, but fails to deliver a significant result on the entirety of the movie. The fight scenes among the beastly creatures are good and sometimes thrilling but lack sustained pulling effect to keep the audience holding their breath.<br/><br/>The huge potential of the casts is not fully and properly utilized; most of whom remain ineffective throughout the film and fail to establish enough impact to connect their presence to the whole story. Even Aaron Taylor-Johnson's role doesn't seem to matter as the focus of the movie seems to always fall on its real superstars, Godzilla itself and a pair of smaller villainous monsters whose potential mating poses threat to the whole world. In main, this movie is good, its biggest asset are still the monsters and as far as the fighting scenes are concerned, this one is tolerable, I mean still good, but not explosive enough to deliver edge-of-your-seat thrill."
"hwpo1122","8","8","16","15 May 2014"," Godzilla: At Moments Stunning and at Others Flawed
","First, I want to say that I am a longtime Godzilla fan. I grew up watching Godzilla and have seen every film he has ever been in. So going into this, I had high expectations. The movie did not disappoint terribly but there are many flaws that could have been easily fixed. It is still an enjoyable film that offers many moments and scenes that are worth the ticket and even worth paying $35 for a combo pack once it is released to retailers.<br/><br/>I want to focus on the good things first. This film has a star- studded cast and just about everyone delivers at expectations and beyond expectations. The CGI is state of the art and some of the sequences are thrilling. The action is some of the best I have seen in quite some time. This film is being compared to Pacific Rim by many but I must say that Pacific Rim was nowhere near as good as Godzilla. Pacific Rim was what the trailers promised and nothing more. Godzilla had many surprises and even some golden Easter eggs that I will not spoil. The cinematography in this film is beautiful and very jaw dropping at times. Edwards did a magnificent job directing and I can't wait to see what he does next. Bryan Cranston was amazing as always. Aaron Taylor Johnson dazzled in his first major role in a serious film. Elizabeth Olsen was great also. When director Gareth Edwards said that this film was going to be like Jaws in the sense that you wouldn't see Godzilla until an appropriate time, he delivered. Godzilla has more of a classic look and the antagonists in this film also impressed. Edwards really tried to shoot this film from the eyes of an onlooker and this created a very gratifying experience for the viewers. Its plot is very well thought out and offers quite a few twists and turns that the trailers didn't spoil. Overall, the positives for the film are quite indulging for Gojira fans everywhere. I encourage anyone who loves Godzilla to see this film.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives, I will not go too in depth to spoil anything but I will give an overview. There are some gaping plot holes and also some incredibly unrealistic moments in this film that obviously sought for dramatic scenery rather than realism. One of the lead actors in the cast was incredibly disappointing and it really hurt my overall view of the film. There are many lapses of human interaction where things happen and you wonder how they did in the first place. There is also something in the beginning that happens that will kind of make you feel mislead. Speaking of misleading, the trailers, in my own opinion, do not do this film a lot of justice. There are a lot of scenes in the trailers that are not in the film, which made me feel disappointed as well. It is not as dark as has been advertised and sometimes the film even feels lighthearted. Finally, my biggest disappointment was the score. It was not brooding and dark like the trailers made it seem to be and also it was a bit overbearing at times.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is definitely worth seeing but do not expect an Oscar-winning, top 250 film (though Captain America did make it into the top 250 for some reason). The film is incredibly fun and offers many moments when the audience had to cheer. I encourage all Godzilla fans to check it out and I can't wait to see what the special features on the combo pack will reveal when that moment comes.<br/><br/>-Charles Dunphey (Author/Filmmaker/Film Critic/Graphic Novel Writer & Artist<br/><br/>charlesdunphey(dot)blogspot(dot)com"
"MovieloverIreland","5","8","16","15 May 2014"," Over rated
","This was perhaps the film I was looking forward most this summer. The trailers were fantastic, the cast is very talented, a promising Director. Everything was in place so I should have loved it right? Sadly not. Let me explain why (Heavy Spoilers) 1: Bryan CranstonBy far the best thing about the film acting wise, his early scenes are emotional and wonderfully performed which the rest of the movies acting performances cant live up towhy? .because he's killed off in first half hour leaving us with problem number 2. 2: Aaron Taylor Johnson : Now don't get me wrong, I like this actor, I enjoyed him in both ""Kick Ass ""movies and even Oliver Stones ""Savages"" but here he is so unemotional and without facial expression that its very difficult to care for him. Now you might say he's a soldier and trained to be like that and I respect that but my point is it makes for such an un-engaging protagonist to vicariously live the movie through. He just brought no charisma to the role. He struggled to carry this movie when monsters weren't on screen. 3: Godzilla : Much has been written that the titular character only spends 26 minutes on screen but that did not bother me so much. What bothered me was the design of Godzilla. I know some will say it's faithful to the original design and I accept that but for me the original design looked silly. It's a man in a suit after all. I took my 15 year old nephew along with me to see this movie and afterward he said ""Godzilla looked like a fat bear with spikes sticking out of his back"". I found it hard to disagree. 4: It was just boring. For the whole middle third after the attack on Oahu to final battle in San Francisco I felt restless. I get that the director wanted to tease the audience until the final battle but I just wish he gave us something interesting to watch in between.<br/><br/>I probably sound like a hater here but there was scenes I enjoyed. 1: Bryan Cranston was excellent in his few scenes, highlight being his tragic scene with Juliette Binoche at reactor. 2: I enjoyed the Oahu scenes of destruction more than the final battle scenes. 3: ""Let them fight"". great line delivered by ken watanabe 4: Elizabeth Olsen was solid as always but underused in a thankless wife role. 5: Effects were great but avoid seeing it in 3D if you can. 6: Music score had some great eerie moments particularly when soldier skydived into city.<br/><br/>Overall I did leave disappointed but I respect what the director tried to achieve."

At first i didn't know that Godzilla would fight to defend the Earth. Simply amazing and epic. I hope that there will be a sequel or a prequel. But it's not going to happen.

","This movie actually starts out with potential. There is a real creepy Japan Fukushima reactor vibe going and tension developing as a nuclear power plant reactor melts down and explodes due to an earthquake and tsunami. <br/><br/>Flash forward 15 years. The American consultant to the plant (Bryan Cranston) is still living in Japan obsessed with finding out what really caused the earthquake. The Japanese government has quarantined the facility and surrounding area.<br/><br/>Cranston manages to get into the plant just as some subterranean creature is getting out, a Muto. In the process Cranston dies, and so does all logic, reason, and continuity. What follows is a series of incongruous events, each one requiring more suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Think of Die Hard killing off Bruce Willis in the first 30 minutes, or Rocky killing off Stallone.<br/><br/>His son now has to do all the heavy lifting, and he doesn't have a clue.<br/><br/>The US military has been reduced to one aircraft carrier, a handful of dysfunctional planes and tanks, and one solitary nuclear weapon to use on the several creatures that feed on nuclear energy. The nuke is so big that it can only travel by train or tugboat, except when it is being helicoptered to the train.<br/><br/>The big fight scene between Godzilla and the Mutos occurs at night, and it is so violent that the camera is constantly shaking. Several dark gray creatures, in the dark, surrounded by dark dust, moving in and out of the frame. Did I mention how dark it was? <br/><br/>This is a movie where nobody cares about anything. Giant creatures destroying the city and people hardly notice. A giant creature swims under a ship, no big deal. Half a mountain missing, has it always been like that? Golden Gate bridge ripped to shreds; hey we gotta get these kids off this bus right now or their parents will be really upset! The monsters don't seem to care either, everyone's just there for a paycheck.<br/><br/>Great CGI of destroyed cities, maybe its a video game disguised as a movie."

Because I had a large lunch at B-King next door, I fell asleep several times in the movie, but manage to keep my eyes open in the last 15 minutes, & saw a Dead godzilla lying in the streets of some metropolitan city( san francisco?),& then slowly he opened his eyes, & then proceeded to crawl back in the ocean & disappear, which apparently was the point of the whole movie, a feel good movie, which in my opinion had a strong human element,courtesy Bryan cranston,& therefore deserves a 10 rating,especially for the CGI effects.It is curious that this movie, brings back memories of the horrific Tsunami disaster at that ""fuji....something"" nuclear power plant which took so many Japanese lives,& is still commemorated in various annual celebrations in Japantown,san francisco...."

But it has just the plot to make the movie look brilliant. The storyline was a bit slow, I agree but the pace was just good enough to give the Godzilla a deserving entry. The movie had a worthy opponent which was in my opinion the highlight. It also had the visual punch which I think was missing in the previous movies. The monster was very well depicted and if you are someone who in the middle of the movie worry about the plot could have been altered here, it will not disappoint you. I mean you know you are walking in to a movie with a gigantic fictional character who is best known for toying mighty tanks and withstanding direct missile attacks. If you should still expect story line or LOGIC you are clearly wrong. I relived the 9 year old boy in me. I jumped when I saw the monster in daylight and the pure roar of this beast gave me bumps.<br/><br/>Godzilla is not the cup of tea for serious critics but god it was great fun.

","Let me start by stating that in my opinion this is the best monster movie ever made. That being said I want to tell you why. Well first of all, I mean come on it's Godzilla probably the most iconic monsters in film history besides King Kong and Gamera. This film also improves on the whole genre by giving you a reason to care about the people in it. It's not all Godzilla, which I understand would anger some but for me having him in little segments here and there and then having the final epic fight was very satisfying because Arron Taylor Johnson's story was interesting in itself. I also noticed how the monsters didn't feel like monsters, they felt like animals who are trying to survive and breed. This gave the film a much needed realistic feel to it and grounds it a bit. The cgi is top notch and will probably get nominated next year and while no awards will be given to the acting, all the actors held their own and Bryan Cranston was awesome. OK I know what your all waiting for the final fight scene. Well I have to say that it was one of the best fight scenes it have ever scene. Godzilla just kicks major A** when he breathes his fire. So as you can tell I couldn't fine a single thing I don't like besides the first 5 minutes but that won't make me lower my score. Well Godzilla is back the RIGHT way!!"

It's better that those. You won't see main beast for long, and all battles were created at night or at the dawn, but it doesn't look cheap rater it looks haunting. There is also a nice story, but nothing special. Ken Watanabe's character was looking very surprised in all scenes, but there were no special performances. I'm glad i watched it on the big screen in 3D, because on home cinema i't won't be very impressive, but overall special effects and especially sound effects were really good, and sometimes very haunting.

I had no recollection of the Godzilla story. All I knew was that Bryan Cranston, the main star of one of my most favorite TV shows, Breaking Bad, was going to be in it. And that was it. <br/><br/>Now, I've never ever went into a movie blind, but I wanted to see if I'd get a different feeling, a different opinion of the film, unlike the way I would get my hopes up from the totally mind blowing trailer and footage they've released, and then feeling so disappointed afterward, that I would rate it with a biased opinion. So what would it feel like going into a movie with no opinions... no.. ANYTHING.<br/><br/>And, WOW. Maybe it was just the movie itself, or going in blind, but that was just..WOW. Bryan Cranston was brilliant. The sound effects blew me away, literally took my breath away at certain moments. The CGI was out of this world! Every single scene with Godzilla in it had me thanking God for creating brilliant people to generate such an awe- inspiring thing. <br/><br/>It definitely had its slow moments, I will admit. The main character, Ford (Aaron Johnson), played a military guy to a tee, but I wouldn't have picked him out of a group of navy seals. He had nothing much going for him, as a characters. He wasn't particularly leading any special missions to stop bad things from happening. He was just there, being in the wrong place at the right time, and following the rest of the military groups. I didn't really care if any of the characters died because that's just how weak the development was portrayed. This movie was not a character driven film. This movie relayed heavily on special effect and kick ass monsters and in THAT, they did very well."

This movie's plot is, as I said above, idiotic, making the action scenes mostly unexciting and uninteresting. It also might be OK if you could actually see the action, but much of the time you can't. Most of the action takes place at night in scenes so dimly lit that you can't see what is going on.<br/><br/>This film has no - repeat, NO - redeeming features. Don't waste your time."

","Let's just start by acknowledging this is not really a Godzilla movie, but an action film that follows the template of every 150 million dollar Hollywood CGI-enhanced action film. It feigns loyalty to its source material then completely rearranges the deck, so that Godzilla is no longer spawned by atomic radiation and the MUTO creatures, which so feed off nuclear energy, are acceptable to today's audiences. They are designed exactly like every other unidentifiable CGI crustacean dripping goo, from After Earth to Starship Troopers to Pacific Rim. The film wreaks of poor continuity, underdeveloped characters and nonsensical military operations, sometimes just for the sake of a camera perspective (like the superfluous air drop). So it is perfect for today's audiences who just want to witness disaster and death in 3D in a vacuum. 160 million dollars and 800 digital artists and here I am watching The Godzilla Power Hour...or maybe I'd rather be."
"qormi","10","12","27","16 May 2014"," Excellent film....very well made.
","The 3D was very good. It was ""on"" throughout the film. Very interesting story line...okay..probably a lot of plot holes, but taking it for what it is, solid entertainment. The havoc depicted in Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco was breathtaking. The pace was very good...the mysterious crisis, the historical revelations, and the horrible ineffectiveness of modern technology to combat these mega monsters was convincingly depicted.The movie's strength lies in its imaginative direction...lots of surprises.This is set apart from other Godzilla movies because it took itself very seriously..no cute asides, nothing played for laughs...just terror...from a tsunami to a wobbling suspension bridge."
"thebigd-1","10","12","27","16 May 2014"," Stunning, a must see
","Minor spoilers below<br/><br/>First of all keep in mind...Gareth Edwards is an amateur director...with only one low budget title under his belt before this blockbuster. OK, with that said I think he truly made a masterpiece. This is not a movie for people who are thirsting for monster fights and destruction...even though there is plenty of both in the movie but for some it is not enough apparently(-_-). The beginning is slow and uneventful but in a very good way, building up the back story and perfect human character development. After the male Muto hatches the pace of the movie accelerates RAPIDLY, the fight scenes are well made and teased in the early part of the movie...but believe me Gareth quenches your thirst in the final climax. The Godzilla design is awe inspiring, keeping true to the original film with multiple subtle differences. Where I think this film excels is in the design of the Mutos...just WOW! My new favorite monster design, not to disrespect Toho but they knocked this new monster design out of the park. The human performance by one Bryan Cranston is filled with heart and soul...but it doesn't last long(Spoiler) so that leaves Aaron Taylor Johnson with the remainder of the emotional load...he didn't do as great of job as I would have liked. However, it is better than most! This movie is not just about Godzilla...it is a human driven story. People need to keep in mind that this movie can't be 2 hours of monster fight scenes...it is something more. It is a masterpiece, Thank you Gareth. Thank you!"
"atlihafsteinsson","10","13","30","17 May 2014"," A beautiful film that challenges your expectations
","""The arrogance of man is to believe that he controls nature, not the other way around."" So speaks Ken Watanabe's character in this movie, Godzilla 2014. It is a fantastic film, and it flies in the face of the philosophy of Godzilla 1998 and, more recently, Pacific Rim. The attitude of Godzilla 2014 towards its titular character is respectful. The story is not about ""how do we kill the giant monster, yay mankind wins"", so prevalent in our media today. No, it's about respect for nature, and how to make up for our own mistakes, and let nature take care of itself.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie is one of the best trailers I have seen for some time, and it completely leads you off course to what the movie's about. You think that Godzilla's gonna be the bad guy, that the movie's about how we can elevate our mankind ego even more and kill him. The movie couldn't have steered further away from that trap. Godzilla fulfills a role that he does in the Japanese movies; a colossal guardian, answering the call whenever colossal threats arise that require his colossal touch to qualm.<br/><br/>The movie presents the age old tropes; the military's gonna nuke the threat to smithereens. But the events change the game drastically and Godzilla's left to do his job while the military, among which is our human main character, seek to prevent the damage they sought to use to wipe out the Threat. The Threat, I say, not Godzilla.<br/><br/>Godzilla 2014 left the biggest smile on my face. It's a movie whose attitude towards nature and monsters is to be commended, and which I would love to see more of. It's my favourite live action film of the decade."

","I will never get those 2+ hours back. I kept waiting for some emotion to pull me in. To make me want everyone to survive and live happily ever after, but it just didn't happen. Godzilla and these other 2 creatures are terrorizing San Francisco and people are at work in a high rise, sitting at their desk like it's just another day at the office?? Seriously? I don't think so. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (main character) acted more like he was posing for a cover of GQ magazine, than fighting these monsters. Lone survivor of the attempt to take these nuclear bombs via TRAIN?? Seriously!? This whole movie bombed and my husband fell asleep. I did not care about the family - only that Brian Cranston is in it for a very short time. That blows. Of course, Ken Watanabe was incredible, as always. He was the only person that had true emotion and seemed to genuinely care about what was going on. LIKE IT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE!! Elizabeth Olsen couldn't act (in this movie) if her life depended on it. She's running from Godzilla - turns around and sees him - then turns around and runs. No fear - no screaming - nothing. Just out for an afternoon jog... I'll never go to the movies opening weekend again. I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about. Keep your money!!"
"K_Ripley","3","9","19","13 August 2014"," Godzilla production couldn't afford good writers?
","This movie was LAZILY made. The only props I can give are:<br/><br/>1) they do a good job of portraying Japan without being racist - except for the fact that just about everyone speaks with perfect English accents and that a white gaijin (foreigner) is throwing around orders at a nuclear power plant at the beginning of the film. Yeah right. But they use actual Japanese actors (err.. one) at least. Watanabe Ken!!!! <br/><br/>However. Evoking the fear and pain of Tohoku earthquake and subsequent fukushima meltdown in certain scenes (Hawaii, Japanese power plant) I won't spoil, was really, really cheap. Hollywood evokes the terror of 9/11 all the time, so using disasters as an easy hot button isn't new or surprising. But for God's sake, we haven't even fully rebuilt Miyako yet. We only just this year even confirmed the death toll. Couldn't they wait a couple more years for God's sake? Too soon, man. <br/><br/>2) the action scenes were pretty cool - as to be expected from a high-budget Hollywood film. Anyone giving this movie a high rating is probably thinking of the special effects, because most people seem to be easily dazzled by flashy CGI. But the CGI is all this film has got. This production team was so lazy they even CGI'ed friggin' Mt. Fuji instead of filming on location. Seriously, why bother even using real actors? Make yourself another Final Fantasy travesty, why don't ya. It's too obvious... and there's nothing worse than really obvious CGI. <br/><br/>But the story is terrible and filled with plot holes. Just because the concept is fantastic doesn't mean you have to make it COMPLETELY implausible. If a movie that takes itself as seriously as Godzilla completely dispenses with believability, it interferes with the audiences ability to escape into the movie because they're too busy saying, ""yeah right"" to themselves. When I say ""implausible"" I'm not even talking about radiation-eating giant creatures. That's the most believable bit of the whole movie. Maybe they used all their budget on the actress/actors' and CGI team's salaries, so they didn't have enough money to hire decent writers.. ?"

"Stachehunter-857-73111","8","9","19","18 May 2014"," ""He's gonna do it!""
","We either love kaiju, or we don't. As a life-long fan of Godzilla and his brethren, I've taken the great with the ridiculous, and relished every knocked-down cardboard city that Toho Studios could fabricate for the man in the rubber suit to destroy. Somehow, Godzilla became an icon along the way, even to those who hate monster movies. His take-no-prisoners attitude, physical form, and ability to flatten anything in his path earned respect. The Big G was as recognizable as Coca-Cola, and as indispensable. Love him or hate him, Godzilla cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>So. Here we are in 2014, anticipating the Big G's resurrection, especially after the embarrassment of the 1998 misfire. The new incarnation of Godzilla is something amazing. The first true kaiju to showcase the enormity of this reptile force of nature, using all the tricks in the book to give him life. Director Gareth Edwards has knocked the viewers silly with this epic. He wisely holds Godzilla back until you think you've been had, and then flattens everything with the last act smackdown between the MUTOs and Big G. Godzilla, while not visually present through at least two-thirds of the film, remains a real presence through a number of sly invocations. Remember that even another monster,Dracula himself, the title character of a 400 plus page novel, only appears on about 37 pages. Director Edwards uses this strategy to heighten tension and anticipation. You're thinking about Godzilla from the opening titles. The two MUTOs are the appetizer to the buffet, which is the final sequences of the film. Superior effects and great sound enhance the tasty main course. Godzilla's battle with the MUTOs is often balletic, poetic, and elegiac. Those who hated this film would also have hated a two hour monster battle, claiming it was nothing but fighting, and therefore, boring.<br/><br/>So. Our pal Godzilla proves yet again he can surprise, delight, and yes, even scare jaded viewers who take a minute from looking at their cell phones and annoying the other theater patrons. As I watched the final act of this great monster epic unfold, I kept wondering about Godzilla's ability to breath nuclear fire. Suddenly, the question was about to be answered. My friend, sitting next to me suddenly sat forward and muttered ""he's gonna do it"". And do it he did. How great that we weren't drowned in specific effects here! Director Edwards did tremendous work by undermining your expectations, giving silence when you expected thunder, and paying a ton of homage to the kaiju epics gone by in a hundred off-hand ways. His gift to the die-hard fans didn't go unnoticed by this viewer, especially in the low-key performance of the great Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa. For those who care, or remember, Dr. Serizawa created the Oxy-destroyer, the weapon that actually killed Godzilla in the original 1954 film. Serizawa also perished in that film, but here he is again in a lovely valentine for Godzilla fans. Again, if you never liked these sort of films, why would you think this would be anything other than it presented itself to be? You can't keep a good monster down, and this wonderful take on the Godzilla legend only proved that."
"Laakbaar","8","9","19","16 May 2014"," Surprisingly good
","I don't like this genre, and had low expectations for this movie, but by God(zilla) this movie was good. The disaster and monster scenes were spectacular.<br/><br/>The pacing and plot were OK. The movie held my interest. Some of it was surprising. There were a few breathtaking scenes. My one true groan was when Brody told his wife he would come to rescue them. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the non-CGI scenes was noticeably good.<br/><br/>I liked the Japanese theme of much of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the writers and directors (and especially Bryan Cranston, who's brilliant) did a good job in injecting the story with a human element To me, the movie had an appealingly earnest feel to it, although at times I felt the pull on the heart strings was a little too obvious.<br/><br/>Much of the movie consists of scenes involving the American military, including an awesome halo jump. The military is presented here as heroic and competent. There were remarkably few groans about this.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Jones surprised me. He was cast against type, in my view. (Was that on purpose?) For one thing, he's just too young for this role. Yet he did a fairly good job playing the stalwart hero. And he's certainly easy on the eyes. I'd say that he carries this movie successfully. I particularly liked the scene in the nest, but I won't spoil it.<br/><br/>This movie has led me to think that I might enjoy movies in the future with Taylor-Jones in it, something I didn't think before. In this movie, he's sort of like the beautiful guy you can't help falling in love with even though you know he's an arrogant narcissist who's just going to be a lot of work.<br/><br/>I'd give it around 8. I can't say I was moved at any point. This movie is better than the other ""giant destroyer"" movies out there. (But really I wish movie makers would just give up on these city-destroying movies. 9/11 was 14 years ago. We've processed it already.) Oh yes, one final thing: I wish they had called this movie Gojira rather than Godzilla."
"s_campanale","8","9","19","16 May 2014"," Gojria Vs. Cloverfield - Hollywood Kaiju homage has heart in right place but inherits many problems from its source material.
","As a lifelong Godzilla (and Kaiju movie in general) lover, I was both excited and wary when the new version rolled around, still bearing the terrible scars of disappointment with the 1998 ""reimagining"". Back then nobody would have spent a nickel on a genuine 'Kaiju' homage, but a lot can happen in two decades and now 'Geek is King'! So like last year's equally niche but fun Kaiju/Anime homage ""Pacific Rim' this one nods many knowing winks at the 'cognoscenti while keeping it generic enough for the layperson to part with their entrance fee. <br/><br/>The new take sticks closely to the traditional 'Kaiju' template.The characters are all stock as well, save Taylor Johnson's Brody who is an American military everyman archetype, with scientists and generals meeting regularly to discuss unfolding developments and devise ineffective solutions. 'Godzilla 1998' borrowed from the first movie's premise, Godzilla as atomic destroyer, but it also showed how limited such a template is, becoming 'just another frakking disaster movie'. Even Ishiro Honda and the guys at Toho realised this as the format changed immediately with the second movie, going for a 'whoever wins we lose -Godzilla does battle with another monster who may or may not be more dangerous than he is' style. Eventually the series merged with ""The Mysterians"" to become 'Godzilla and humanoid heroes vs a series of kind of sympathetic but still dangerous alien races who control monsters intent on taking over the Earth' battles, and this is probably Godzilla's most famous phase, giving us classics such as ""Destroy all Monsters"" ""Invasion of the Astro Monsters"" and ""Godzilla vs Gigan"". This film borrows the basic outline of phase 2, Godzilla vs a more dangerous monster while humanity looks on not sure who to back if anyone?<br/><br/>The 'MUTOS' (a designation rather than a name) are based unashamedly on the 'Cloverfield' monster, a clever little jab at that 'found footage' disaster (in more ways than one!) and its pretence to the Godzilla crown. One male hatches and destroys a Japanese nuclear reactor in 1999 while the other incubates until it's ready to mate. This initial story line involves Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody, a scientist and family man who becomes an obsessed maniac when his wife dies, trying to convince the world of the existence of a monster only to be ridiculed and mocked. It's a little homage to one of the best of the original series, ""The Terror of Mechagodzilla', the ultra –dark film with which Honda closed a series that other hands had turned into increasingly cheap and ludicrous bubble gum cartoons for kids. Alas he is only in it for the first twenty five minutes or so, swiftly written out once his character arc is done. (His screen wife Juliette Binoche is in it for even less!) The baton is handed to his son, Aaron 'Kick Ass' Taylor-Johnson, a bomb disposal expert and family man who becomes our 'on the spot' hero armed with the necessary scientific knowledge to make him the human epicentre of events. David Strathairn takes the role of 'General who sits in endless meetings and gives audience exposition' usually played by Yoshifumi Tajima while Ken Watanabe plays the 'wise and knowing' scientist role usually played by Takashi Shimura. Like the originals, two very talented character actors give kudos to utterly empty roles requiring only gravitas and a straight face. Spunky and intelligent female characters were a regular in the series, but for our American hero archetype we have the 'devoted wife and mother' role played by a similarly underused Elizabeth Olson. Perhaps to counterbalance we have Sally Hawkins as Watanabe's assistant, who joins the rest in having little demanded of her talents. Whatever this movie is, a powerhouse acting tour de force it isn't! (save Cranston)<br/><br/>The structure is clunky, the characters two dimensional at best and the dialogue often hokey, but these faults are mostly inherited from the structure they were trying to copy. A bigger fault that is all its own is that we rarely see the battles between Godzilla and the MUTO lovers, a kind of 'always in the background' technique director Gareth Edwards used in his ground breaking sci-fi home movie ""Monsters'. Like Spielberg, this route was taken due to a simple lack of means, and so there is no call for it here. Sure, what we see is great, but we see so little of it! Most appears on TV screens or in the background when all we want is to sit down and get a ringside seat for the big fight, 12 rounds between the champ and the contender, like the originals. It turns out to be extremely frustrating, especially since the human characters we focus on are just place-fillers! <br/><br/>That said, the digital CGI Godzilla looks and moves just like the original (gone is that chicken lizard POS from 1998!) and also has that same intelligence in his expression, reminding us he is no dumb brute. He also has blue fire which powers up along his dorsal fins and punches and throws his opponents, a 'motion capture' update of the 'men in suits' technique, which endears it to the fans. The film ends, as all good Godzilla films do, with the battered hero returning to the sea after his bout is done, leaving the wide eyed humans to see him off. Nobody actually waves and shouts ""Goodbye Godzilla!"" alas, unless it is in a deleted scene somewhere.<br/><br/>At last a Hollywood tribute to Godzilla done right, it is nonetheless riven with problems which may hurt its chances at the Box Office. We hope not, because if this works then future bouts against King Ghidorah, Hedorah, Gigan could become a mouth-watering prospect for future summer seasons!"
"vistheindian","9","9","19","14 May 2014"," God of all monsters in full glory
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Godzilla, one of the most iconic monsters in film history, returns to the big screen in this latest Hollywood reboot. This incredible creature is a force of nature that has come to correct man's mistakes and arrogance. Director Gareth Edwards, remains faithful to the original 1954 Japanese Godzilla in terms of style and pacing, while taking the raw power of the creature to a whole new level. There is a slow build up till we see our anti-hero in full glory, but when he appears on screen it is truly epic. This is a must-see cinematic spectacle that will go down as one of the best monster movies of all time.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I really want to get to the meat of what makes this movie great. I'll also be skipping describing the plot, because it is best for you to experience it and all you need to know is this complex equation: Godzilla x Monster fights = Awesome^2. So let me get some general mediocre things about the movie out of the way. The main problem I can think of for this movie is the human element. It is simply just functional. There is nothing outstanding about the performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, or Ken Watanabe. They all did their jobs fine, portraying their characters realistically and grounded. This isn't even a negative, it's just something that could've been improved upon. I'm nit-picking at this point for negatives if I go any further, so I'll skip to the positives.<br/><br/>Godzilla Oh my f*****g Godzilla!!! Seriously I'm getting goosebumps as I'm typing this. The thing I most liked about this version of Godzilla is that he really felt like a force of nature, completely unstoppable. The character designs are so detailed that you recognize even the subtle expressions and know exactly what the creatures are thinking. This adds a lot of personality to the monsters, they are not just CGI animals. Also Gareth Edwards brilliantly puts you through an emotional roller coaster from sheer terror to childlike glee. There were moments where I was genuinely terrified, to the point that I realized I was pushing myself into my seat and holding my breath. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum there were moments where I was smiling ear to ear, jumping up and down on my seat with excitement, and even cheering loudly with both my fists up in the air. I am a grown man I never do that, and this movie made me react like that without hesitation.<br/><br/>On top of all that, I really like the pacing of the movie. For a long time, the movie teases you with little glimpses of Godzilla. Much like the 1954 version, you don't really get to see Godzilla and monster fights in full action till the last 30mins of the movie. I can see how that can be disappointing for some, but it didn't really bother me. Mainly because the climax of the movie just pays off so well. All the fights are beautifully showcased and choreographed. You feel every bite, crunch, and punch.<br/><br/>Summing up, you have to watch this movie in cinema. If you are on the fence about IMAX, I say go for it because the level of immersion in this movie is the highest since Gravity. I would like to end with a quote from the director himself when asked, what he wanted to achieve with this version of Godzilla: ""make it last 2 hours, and uh lot of foreplay, and so when there is the climax, it is the most powerful it could be."" Lot of intentional innuendo there by him, but honestly I couldn't describe this movie any better."
"Szymanss","8","9","19","14 May 2014"," Go Go Godzilla!
","Godzilla is awesome. The movie takes a long time to get there, but all is forgiven once it does. <br/><br/>To get the negatives out of the way, I do have some issues with the movie. Anyone who's seen Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, should have an idea of what to expect. Both his films are exercises in making monster movies where the monsters aren't the focus, a perspective that can be irksome to action junkies. The first scene where the monsters meet ends so abruptly that I was left scratching my head and eager for more of a battle. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the characters in Godzilla aren't terribly interesting. Monsters had a complex and compelling love story, but Godzilla's cast is mostly there to provide some scale reference for the gigantic beasts roaming about. Ken Watanabe seems to be a doctor of standing around and staring out disconsolately at the horizon (although he does get the best lines).<br/><br/>Yet the film's third act makes up for any flaws with some truly breathtaking effects and payoffs, making you realize what Edwards and co. pulled off with this entry to the Toho legend. Clearly inspired by the mounting tension of Spielberg films(complete with characters dangling precariously from things!), all the reveals feel immensely satisfying. The action, still viewed mostly from the puny humans' perspective, does Godzilla justice. The reintroductions of classic Godzilla elements, which you might have been expecting anyway, feel earned. <br/><br/>And on top of all the destruction, I love that Godzilla is a benevolent force for good! It seems so silly, but so right, especially with a brief, but effective shot revealing Godzilla's inner humanity.<br/><br/>Of course there will be naysayers. I've already seen opposing critiques, some arguing that there was too much action and not enough human beings, and others complaining about too much of a focus on humans instead of the monsters. While I lean toward the latter crowd, I still left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Let's hope Godzilla gets the chance to raid again soon."

It was bad...hilariously bad...ridiculously sloppy film making, plot holes, bad casting, really bad acting, poor dialog, confusing character development also filled with holes, the overall story itself became absurd throughout the film...Lots of crazy loud booming, smashing, destruction and explosion sounds and visuals do not carry a film that has nothing else going for it. Also, lengthening the duration of said sounds does not make them new, exciting, or different.<br/><br/>This film was completely unoriginal, even for a big-budget, summer action-flick.

","No need for any spoiler alerts here, there is nothing to spoil. After watching Gareth Edwards' film, Monsters, I had high hopes that Godzilla would go beyond the formula and the clichés. It is a soulless film that does not garner any emotion. In a few scenes it attempts to mimic the suspense and drama of Jurassic Park, but even fails at that. It is fraught with so many problems, I can't begin to list them all. Even if the screenplay had a chance at one point, my guess is that too many studio execs and too many focus groups destroyed any hope for originality. No suspense. No emotional connection. No reason to see this film, unless you want to study what not to do. From shallow, one-dimensional characters that nobody cares about to inconsistent special effects, it really is a disaster of a movie."

","As you read my review, there will not be any spoilers because I don't want to give too much away or bring up something that I have issues with. I do have one problem with the movie, which I am mixed with but I am keeping my mouth shut. Anyway, that is all I want to mention, and hope you enjoy reading my review. After the other American version of ""Godzilla"" that was made back in 1998 by Roland Emmerich, which it disappointed by many fans and considered to be the worst. Maybe not the worst, but there are some other Godzilla movies that aren't good. As I previously mention in my review of the original classic 1954 movie, I have not seen any of the Godzilla movies or the 1998 movie but I wouldn't mind checking them out. With that said, this Godzilla is awesome and really the monster you don't want to mess with. I got a chance to see it for its first screening and really had a fun time. The action is pretty darn good, and Gareth Edwards does a capable job to handle the action as well as directing. The cast did great in this movie. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were fine with there parts, but I give special praises to Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston. The music by Alexandre Desplat is very subtle, and some of the scenes work well without music like what the original did. The look of Godzilla looks brilliant, and it is cool to hear his classic roar in this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out because Godzilla is back and he is better than ever! I give it a 10 out of 10!"

","Watched Godzilla 2014 last night and it was a great effort from director Gareth Edwards. I love how Godzilla was being portrayed here just like most of times in the comics. The design of the monsters were awesome and really made them look so terrifying <br/><br/>Cast Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen really had that chemistry as husband and wife but to me the only thing that didn't make their marriage look believable was that they looked kind of young to be husband and wife and have a toddler son some more. Glad to see Ken Watanabe back. He did well for his part as so did most of the other cast<br/><br/>Some of my complains however would to be that I think the fight scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOS were not long enough and focus were given more to the humans. Apart from that, I'm was really hoping they brought some of the other classic monsters back instead of creating original ones(MUTOS) for the movie like his 2 main adversaries King Ghidorah and Hedorah The Smog Monster <br/><br/>Overall the fights were still entertaining and Godzilla really looked grand and terrifying to watch. Fans of the series in my opinion will like this movie but casual moviegoers will have 1 or 2 questions on their mind"

","PROS: Lucky to be one of the first to view this incredible movie, Bryan Cransen did an awesome job and added to the intensity of the movie. Loved the new look of Godzilla. Great story line in adding the human element. The scenes were incredible, I liked the scene of the Hilton Rainbow Tower in Waikiki (an actual place) shown torn to shreds, it made it seem real. The sound effects were like watching jaws, you know what's coming but you still freak out when it happens. Everyone in the theater clapped after the show, we were not disappointed by this film. <br/><br/>CONS: The star of the movie (Godzilla)did not have enough air time. The other actors were pretty flat, thankfully Bryan Cransen held up the story, he should get an Emmy for his performance."

","""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people cried; most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture; Vishnu takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" J. Robert Oppenheimer Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Rises, Super 8, Iron Man 2, Watchmen. For the last five years there has always been one film that I was anticipating more than others. Some films on that list I have enjoyed more than others but none have given me the ""wow"" factor that I had been seeking when leaving the cinema. Walking out of Batman in 1989 as a 6-year-old and showing the first flickers of an obsession with those characters that continues to this day. Leaving, the Cinema, having seen Jurassic Park and genuinely wondering why anyone else would ever bother making a film again because it would never top that. This year my attention on the year's releases was focused squarely on Godzilla. I have never been a massive fan of the original Man in Suit Godzilla films. I have enjoyed some of them and been surprised by the heart they convey, owing in part that the movies were originally made as a criticism of American nuclear weapons testing. However, my enjoyment of these films was hamstrung by the poor, often laughable, effects. I have always been a fan of giant monster movies but much like the horror genre, it is hard to find a genuinely good one. Pacific Rim was amazing for those few moments, during the scene in Japan, but otherwise left me flat. And the less said about the 1998 version of Godzilla the better.<br/><br/>So with my excitement at fever pitch, but with the trepidation of someone who has been hurt before, I sat down to watch the latest incarnation of Gojira. Within the first five minutes I would have a smile on my face that would not leave me until long after the credits had rolled. Put simply, it is a masterpiece of event cinema. When Gareth Edwards was announced as the director, I felt it was an interesting choice. I had mostly enjoyed his debut feature Monsters but was curious if his talk heavy, light on action independent film was due to budget or if that was his preferred style. The last Indie darling to be handed an iconic monster movie was Ang Lee and the result was the daddy issue snore fest that was Hulk. Edwards does not make the same mistake. Here he creates some of the most jaw dropping scenes that have ever graced a cinema screen. Monster Vs Monster smack-downs (no Godzuki, sadly), and entire cities being leveled. He holds nothing back. Godzilla's full reveal is a lesson in suspense. There are half glimpses of various parts of the creature to tantalize and tease before we are treated to a full shot of the king of the monsters. This is not to say the director has chosen style over substance and this is clearly evident in his choice of cast. Forgoing the A-list name above the title actors and instead assembling a cast who treat the material with the seriousness of a Shakespearean play. Bryan Cranston has emerged from Breaking Bad as one of the best and most in demand actors in the game right now. Here, he adds a heft and heart to his role as a man racked with guilt over his part in a family tragedy. The scene with Cranston helplessly looking on as he is forced to make an impossible decision with regards to his family shows him at his brilliant best. Watching him devour the screen every bit as much as his 350ft co-star is amazing. To think, if it weren't for Walter White, one of the great acting talents of our time would have been forever known as Malcolm in the Middle's dad. He is supported by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass) as his son, with the vehicular sounding name of Ford Brody. Elizabeth Olsen plays Ford's wife Elle and adding to the Jaws homage, their son is called Sam, which is Quint's first name. The two will be seen together again next year as the super siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age Of Ultron. To say too much about the plot would ruin perhaps the best event movie since Jurassic Park. The movie does not skimp on story and never descends into a clichéd man Vs. military/America-is-awesome that so many of these films tend to do. At its heart there is a real message about man's interference with nature, with a chilling reminder that at any time Mother Nature can remind us that we are the ones under her control and not the other way around. The monster himself is a beautiful design, paying homage to past incarnations but definitely one they have made their own. He feels real and every roar and step is felt. There are moments when his eyes alone convey more depth and emotion than a million Kirsten Stewarts. One moment in particular, showing almost a glimmer of understanding between man and beast, is beautifully understated. Capturing in one moment what the recent Amazing Spider-Man 2 failed to do in the cringe worthy scene with the child. Overall, the film is an undoubted triumph and one that needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. IMAX 3D has always seemed somewhat gimmicky to me, Gravity being an example of one that worked in that medium but does not carry its resonance over to the small screen. However, I don't see Godzilla having this problem. This will be a film I will be re-watching for years to come. Step aside Cloverfield, back to the ocean with the Kaiju of Pacific Rim and as for King Kong, as the song says ""Whats a King to a God?"". <br/><br/>The true king ofthe monsters has reclaimed his throne. Long live the King"
"sagarp9000","8","7","14","28 May 2014"," Very good film! Quite possibly my favourite Godzilla movie.
","The movie starts out very well, in fact if the entire movie was consistently as good as it is within the first 40 odd minutes and last 20 minutes, I think it would be rated a solid 9/10.<br/><br/>The movie has a good cast although I would say does not utilise them to their full potential, Aaron Taylor Johnson did a good job but not an excellent job as the main character of the film. The most interesting characters were Joe Brody and Dr Serizawa (Bryan Cranston, and Ken Watanabe). For the amount of time Cranston is in the film he does extremely well to pull in the audience, his emotion and tone within the film allows you to get attached to his character and actually care about the character.<br/><br/>As per Godzilla himself, he isn't in the movie too much, in my opinion he also isn't in the movie too little, but a bit more appearances and monster action from Godzilla would have added to the overall rating and satisfaction of the film. However whenever Godzilla is about to make an appearance a lot of suspense is built up and that ultimately makes it a really epic and exciting. This was done extremely well, it made sure the audience didn't get bored of seeing Godzilla and also did not reveal too much on him too early in the film.<br/><br/>The score by Alexandre Desplat is outstanding. There are three things when it comes to the film that I can truly say are worthy of being 10/10. This includes the OST/Score, along with that also the CGI & special effects. If you are worried by the trailer as I personally thought the CGI did not look incredibly impressive in the trailers, fear not as in the actual movie the CGI and special effects are breathtakingly brilliant. Finally Cranston's acting is so good that the movie is kept interesting while his character is in the film. The first 40 minutes and also last 20 minutes I would say are a 9-10/10.<br/><br/>Overall a very good film a solid 7.5/10, closer to 8/10 than 7/10. It does contain a few flaws that prevents it from reaching it's potential and beating the hype. This is unfortunate because this movie really had the potential to be as good as 'The Dark Knight' or at least be on that level of film.<br/><br/>I suggest to anyone who is interested in watching the film to watch it in a good cinema like an IMAX or even one that has a very large screen and clear audio system. Don't be put off by the negative reviews/ratings and go watch this movie with an open mind and I'm sure you won't regret it."

"raj040492","8","7","14","16 May 2014"," Godzilla walks tall
","This movie is the best case study (after Dark knight trilogy) of how amazing a director's perspective can change within a decade and half. No offense to Roland Emmerich, his version was a pure entertainer firing on all cylinders (some may have a different opinion on this), but the reboot has made the Roland version seem like an amateur's first documentary. Comparisons will only garner more positives for the newer version.<br/><br/>C-G stands out. Oh let me correct, ""walks tall"". Despite repeated Dejavu's of Pacific Rim, this movie has an unique impact of its own. And these action sequences are brilliantly balanced by the father-son angle along with the husband-wife angle which only makes the movie more realistic rather than just a tell-tale of how a monster ran havoc on earth.<br/><br/>The entire cast (notably Cranston, Wantanbe, Aaron taylor) have played their parts. No Oscar winning performances, just swimming with the tide and helping the screenplay. <br/><br/>The other notable fact is that Godzilla is painted as a savior rather than a destructor. Though he roars like a T-Rex and is even referred as a dinosaur (by Aaron taylor's son) his sheer volume would make any other T-Rex run away in search of shelter.<br/><br/>The camera crew have well complimented the C-G. Be it the HALO jump visualized through the helmet or revealing Godzilla through flares or the sequence on the railway track, the lords of the lens have proved their mettle again.<br/><br/>Watching it in Inox (3D) was an added bonus.<br/><br/>Godzilla: Stands Tall."

","This film had a great chance to send a strong anti-nuclear message and instead did the opposite. The last minutes of the film paint this clear as day when we see the main protagonist fall asleep instead of disarming a live nuke that is literally minutes from exploding.<br/><br/>Apparently sending the bomb half a mile out at sea was enough to shield the entire city and people from the blast?!?! Maybe the rationale was that they needed an explosion at the end? <br/><br/>This movie was offensive in its complete disregard for nuclear disarmament - which is comical in that it is remaking a film entirely based around the consequences of nuclear weapons."
"b_foore90","10","5","9","11 June 2016"," The king returns
","I've long been a Godzilla fan, I've seen almost every movie and the original one from 1954 still hails as a classic in my opinion and while there was some things that could have been done better in this movie, I still feel like movie was one of the best movies of 2014 and marked a successful return for the King to America. Yes, holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too ""human centered"" movie. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title character around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning). Besides, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done a lot better then the simple ""lets nuke em"" approach. I didn't have as much problems with the MUTOS either but I more so had a problem with how they were pushed up to be some unstoppable force but were easily destroyed in a rather awesome fashion by Godzilla. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done and provides a lot of hope for a string of successful American Godzilla movies."

","One of those over-hyped flicks of the year 2014 so expectations were high. Have seen it in 3D I only can say that I liked the 3D even if it wasn't that stunning like in The Hobbit franchise but it do works sometimes rather good. On part of the story itself it was okay but hey, shouldn't it be going all about Godzilla? <br/><br/>Mostly you don't watch these monster flicks for the acting but you rather watch it for the monsters itself and there lays the problem. The main actor Godzilla itself isn't that much to catch in this flick, that's a bit sad because I was left with a hunger after one hour with the only question, when will he come? Once Godzilla is there the action really starts and the CGI and effects used are indeed okay but by then it's a bit too late. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a bad flick but face it, we are overwhelmed with monster flicks the last years (Pacific Rim (2013) for example) who are full of action between the monsters itself and that's what Godzilla is in fact all about, Godzilla do saves the world after all.<br/><br/>It starts rather good with excellent performance by Brian Cranston we all know of Breaking Bad and I was hooked on the screen. But once we move further 15 years it just starts to become a mediocre flick. I wasn't alone watching it and all I can here was where's Godzilla? <br/><br/>Still worth picking up if you do like flicks about giant monsters and naturally Godzilla lovers will have it in their collection but at the end of the day, it wont stick in your mind.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

","To me when you watch a movie like this, ""Godzilla"", you don't intend to take it too seriously. It is all fantasy, the best that I can hope is to be entertained.<br/><br/>I was entertained! <br/><br/>Part of the entertainment for me is the soundtrack. I saw it on DVD in my own home theater, well-equipped with a powered subwoofer that goes down into the 18Hz range. This movie has such an aggressive deep bass soundtrack that pictures on the wall were rattling and the hair on my arms standing up. It really feels like you are in the action, a bit scary at times.<br/><br/>The movie itself? It plays off the 1954 Godzilla where nuclear tests in the Pacific were responsible for Godzilla. But this story takes a bit different tack. Godzilla has been around, lurking below the surface, for all that time. The military knew about it but kept it from the public.<br/><br/>Now in modern times there are a couple of strange events and the result are giant, like 200 to 300 feet tall, monsters that look like giant insects and fly. Plus they feed off radioactive materials. There is a male and a female and they plan to mate. If left unchecked they will reproduce and soon the whole world will be theirs.<br/><br/>So it is up to Godzilla to restore order.

"jmanchak6","6","5","9","7 August 2014"," Oh, How I Wanted to Love it
","One night, when I was five years old, my dad came home from the video store with a copy of ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"" on VHS. I watched it that night, and countless more times throughout my life. It sparked what would become a lifelong obsession with Godzilla, and other monster movies. For years, I was teased for liking these kinds of movies, and I didn't have anyone to share my love for them with. When I was sitting in my seat to watch this film on opening night, a theatre attendant informed the audience that the screening was completely sold out, so everyone had to move as far into the row as possible. I heard everyone talking about how excited they were for the movie, and I thought back to my childhood. If only my younger self could see this moment, being in a sold-out theatre, about to see a new Godzilla movie, being surrounded by a bunch of people who seemed genuinely excited about seeing The King of the Monsters on the big screen.<br/><br/>The Warner Bros. logo popped up, as a wonderful piece of eerie music set the tone that all Godzilla fans had been looking for since the 1998 abomination. 2 hours later, I walked out of the theatre, and I'm not lying when I say this: it was the most disappointing experience I've ever had in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>Now, you see that I've given the film a rating of 6/10. That's pretty decent for something that's supposedly ""the most disappointing movie theatre experience of my life"". That's because this wasn't necessarily a bad film, but I went in, and I think everyone went in, expecting a great movie. The hype train carried my expectations to a place where the film couldn't possibly go. The posters, the trailers (seriously, whoever did the trailers for the film deserves an Oscar), the interviews with the cast and filmmakers, it was all perfect. Legendary Pictures was hitting ""the G spot"" with hardcore fans and general moviegoers alike. I walked in, fully expecting some disappointments, but the final product could be described as a total disappointment. <br/><br/>Honestly, if I wasn't so emotionally attached to the Godzilla franchise, I'd probably say that this movie was terrible. Personal nostalgia and hope for the future of Godzilla films is the main driving force behind my 6/10 rating. Unlike most Godzilla fan-boys, I don't get mad at critics who give this film negative reviews, because for the most part, they have very valid criticisms. I also don't get mad at fans who say they loved the movie, as long as they acknowledge its flaws. What I can't stand is the army of moronic Godzilla fan-boys all over the internet who praise this film as some kind of masterpiece. These ""fans"" have said that I'm not a REAL Godzilla fan because I don't blindly worship Gareth Edwards and the film he made. Well, to all idiotic fan-boys, I AM a real Godzilla fan, and I thought Godzilla deserved to be in a far better movie. If anything, YOU'RE not the real Godzilla fan, because you're actually settling for this heap of radioactive garbage.<br/><br/>So what made the film so disappointing? Well, IMDb has a 1000-word limit for reviews, and I could seriously write a novel with all of the issues I had with the film, so I'll stick to the main points. <br/><br/>Right off the bat, you have Dave Callaham writing the first draft of the script, and was ultimately given a ""story"" credit. This genius was the screenwriter behind the cerebral masterpiece that was 2005's ""Doom"". From there, a slew of other writers, including David S. Goyer, Max Borenstein and Drew Pearce all had their hand in Godzilla's atomic cookie jar.Finally, Frank Darabont was brought in to do a bit of work on the script right before shooting began. This amalgam of writers shows why the film's plot felt so disjointed and uninspired.<br/><br/>What bothers me more than anything about this movie is that it was being promoted as this amazing drama with a human-driven story. Well, yeah it's a human-driven story, but just SHOWING humans on the screen doesn't mean that the audience is going to automatically emotionally attach to them. The characters aren't given any valuable screen time to develop. This is criminal when you consider the unbelievably talented cast that they managed to rope into a Godzilla movie. Acclaimed actors across the board, that are completely wasted. I seriously think that Sally Hawkins' character was created solely because Legendary wanted another female character in the movie, because they realized that Olsen and Binoche had like 5 minutes of total screen time between them. So they just gave Hawkins a handful of Ken Watanabe's lines, and they serve as blatant exposition.<br/><br/>Everyone says that Edwards made the movie like ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"", as it has a slow-burn and the film builds up until you finally see the titular monster. Well, this is no ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"". Those films developed their characters so the audience cared about them. Plus, those films made sure that just because you can't SEE the monster, that doesn't mean that the audience doesn't feel its presence. <br/><br/>Let me ask a question that even the most casual movie fan could probably answer correctly: What happens in the first scene of ""Jaws""? <br/><br/>Answer: The shark attacks. Its presence is instantly established. <br/><br/>The biggest complaint with the film, and it isn't unwarranted, is that Godzilla himself is severely underused. A good human story with decent characters that we cared about could have made this movie great. Or, focusing on Godzilla, instead of the boring humans and the uninspired MUTO, would have also made for a great movie. But this film simply didn't tap into its full potential.<br/><br/>On the plus-side, that fight scene was freakin' awesome."

"dfranzen70","8","5","9","31 May 2014"," Definitely thrillin'
","You know, I did like the original 1954 Godzilla, but part of me saw it more as a tongue-in-cheek monster movie of the time than as a straight- up horror film. And when the oh-so-American version came out in 1998, I saw that one as almost a comedy, and not in a good way. But this one? This new version of the oft-told tale is downright terrifying, combining a plausible origin with sterling special effects and not one but three really big monsters.<br/><br/>Our story begins in the Phillippines in 1999. Scientists are called to a mine in which a huge skeleton has been unearthed; within this skeleton are two pods - one broken open, with a trail leading to the sea. Not long after, unusual seismic activity is recorded at the Janjira nuclear power plant in Japan. The plant's operator, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) sends his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and her team down into the core to check the sensors. But then there's this big explosion, and Sandra and the other scientists in the core are trapped. Publicly, the disaster, which affects all of Japan, is attributed to a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.<br/><br/>Some 15 years later, the Brodys' son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a Navy bomb-disposer guy, to use the technical term, and he's a bit estranged from his dad, who's become obsessed with finding out the true reason for the so-called earthquake. Shortly after Ford returns home to San Francisco to be with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam, he learns that Papa Joe has been arrested in Japan for trespassing on the grounds of the old, now-quarantined plant. Joe insists that there was no earthquake, that an electromagnetic pulse was behind the disaster. And he may be right, because while Ford is in Japan collecting his dad, there's another incident, and a gigantic winged creature flees the scene. No, it's not Godzilla, but he's around somewhere.<br/><br/>Fret not; Gozdilla does show up, and when he does it's a real heart stopper. He's not King Kong tall, he's more like ten or eleven King Kongs tall. He's Kanye's ego tall. He's Donald Sterling's racism tall. He's a big fella, is what I'm getting at here. Anyway, he and Winged Monster (called a MUTO, for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) are soon joined by another creepy dude, who's like Winged Monster although without wings. They both sort of look like the monster from Cloverfield, come to think of it, but much more realistic.<br/><br/>Would it be spoiling things if I noted that all three beat the heck out of each other? Probably not. It's also not a spoiler to note that the armed forces attempt to use everything from handguns to tank ordnance on our friendly neighborhood monsters, to little avail. Nuclear weapons are mentioned. <br/><br/>This is such a visceral movie. There's little in the way of shaky-cam cinematography, and you almost never get a full-on look at any of the monsters. This is good, because it highlights how damn huge these guys are; if you or I were there, we wouldn't be able to fully comprehend their colossal stature without moving back, oh, a couple hundred miles. All of this makes the movie feel very much real and as if you're very much in the middle of things, 3D or not. The CGI is worlds better than it was for Roland Emmerich's 1998 dud.<br/><br/>There are plenty of jaw-dropping moments of terror, and there are a multitude of on-screen deaths, PG-13 rating or not. There's always this lingering feeling of being trapped. After all, you can't go into the water (Godzilla swims!), and you can't go into the city (Godzilla smash!), and you can't even go into the mountains, because these guys are tall, tall, tall. How tall? Grande from Starbucks tall. So you're trapped, and you can't figure out how to stop them, since bullets don't work. <br/><br/>Turns out it's not complicated, but I'll let you see for yourself on that score. Anyway, although I watched the 3D version of this, I don't think the 3D added much to the experience. It didn't take away from it (that is, it wasn't distracting), but it did seem needless in retrospect. <br/><br/>But the bottom line for me is that Godzilla is a lot less campy and much, much scarier than the version from olden times (1954). Think World War Z without zombies or the ability to zip around from continent to continent. Okay, so technically here we move between North America and Asia, but you get the idea."

","Do you remember the hype and build up to Roland Emmerich's much-anticipated Godzilla in 1998? Do you recall the disappointment that followed? Did you catch the hype and build up to Gareth Edwards' take on the behemoth? Does it follow the pattern? <br/><br/>The short version is yes. And no. Godzilla doesn't live up to the hype, it doesn't match expectations and, yes, it is mildly disappointing. But as for it being a let down, nope, not so much. Edwards, in his second outing as director after 2010's low budget blinder, Monsters, gives us a big budget B movie packed with effects that thrills and entertains even if it doesn't excite, terrorize and inspire awe in the manner we'd like. Part of that comes down to Edward himself. Monsters was such a fine, unexpected delight and he set the bar so high for himself that it was unlikely he could surpass it with so much of other people's money and the pressure and interference that presumably brings.<br/><br/>The Godzilla aficionados will possibly find much to howl at, but for the casual viewer and happy bystander amidst the havoc wreaking there is much to enjoy here with the nuke-crunching prehistoric monsters. A little more backstory and reason is given for the emergence of Godzilla and his prey, and the human interest story is given a fair run with the relationship between scientist-cum-embittered-conspiracy-theorist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and his estranged, cynical, soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br/><br/>Though Taylor-Johnson has come a long way since Nowhere Boy and makes a reasonable focal point, Godzilla hangs on the name of Cranston, the biggest 'star' on screen here. That comparatively little is made of Joe is something of a surprise and the greatest disappointment. The charisma he threatens to exude is wasted in a lack of screen time and Taylor-Johnson's Ford has neither the impact to be truly memorable nor the circumstances to really shine on this occasion.<br/><br/>Godzilla is sprinkled with a few actors who deserve more, but Edwards wastes them, or rather doesn't waste time on them when he can focus on monsters ripping cities to shreds. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife, Elle; Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa; David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz; Sally Hawkins as Vivienne Graham; none of them are allowed to really sink their teeth into their characters or dominate the screen. Hawkins is particularly wasted (and more than a little wooden, alas), disappearing for a vast chunk of the movie and reappearing almost as an afterthought as though Edwards suddenly remembered she was on the payroll. Not that I'd noticed she had gone AWOL.<br/><br/>Yes, Godzilla is the star of this franchise, but then so were the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park series, but that didn't stop Crichton and Spielberg from making the human characters count for something.<br/><br/>There is some lovely camera work on display and this is where Edwards' Godzilla really shines. Frequently we are positioned behind people or objects, jostling for a view of the monsters, our vision frustratingly blocked by heads and obstacles, placing us right there in the action and causing us to unconsciously move in our seats to look around the obstruction. But is it enough? <br/><br/>Will you enjoy Godzilla? Think of it as Transformers with dinosaurs (and a smidgen of Alien) only better and if that grabs you, take a punt. Better still, take the kids.

","60 years ago, a monster rose up from the depths. Godzilla, a gargantuan beast borne from nuclear fire, invaded the monster movie scene in 1954 and gave us a terrifying vision of Tokyo's destruction. Godzilla's reign persisted through nearly thirty movies, seeing the titular monster as both villain and hero, pitting him against a whole universe of monsters, aliens, armies, and machines. Then, after running through a whole gauntlet of battles in Godzilla: Final Wars, the beast was given a good ten-year rest.<br/><br/>In 2014, Godzilla rose up again with a fresh new look and fresh talent. Even though the beast has been rebooted repeatedly before, he has never before hit the western shores as hard. In this American production, great care and detail has been given to provide a hard-hitting thrill ride that will remain true to Toho's original vision.<br/><br/>In a somewhat Spielbergian fashion, Gareth Edwards' vision of Godzilla purposefully builds tension before giving us the actual monster combat. Much like Jurassic Park, the film steadily builds up the suspense with tremors, sound, and focus on subtle details. Much like Jaws, the actual monsters receive limited screen-time to maximize their impact when you do see them. And much like 2005's War of the Worlds, much of the action is subdued to the background, with a firmer focus on the characters' drama. Above all, Godzilla represents an evolution of Edwards' debut film Monsters, which accomplished all these same techniques on a more limited scale.<br/><br/>What this amounts to is a film that builds and builds, taking its time on character-building and plotting before giving us what we really want: all-out monster bashing and city stomping. When you finally get to it, the mass destruction is modestly satisfying. Special effects are top-notch throughout, giving us an intense and epic vision of creatures smashing into each other and smashing into buildings. However, the action is not overblown or overdone, and it never overwhelms the plot.<br/><br/>The actual story involved is pretty much on-par with the older Godzilla films; most of these give us a handful of military and scientist characters who figure out what's going on, then behold some massive monster battle. This film stays true to this formula, but the focus is constant on the characters and their struggles, whether it be the struggle to deal with the monsters, or the struggle to save loved ones. The film definitely tries to pull at the heartstrings by showcasing a father trying to reunite with his family, while also trying to save his father and fulfill his mission. While this can be a bit contrived and sappy, the film does have a little more depth and power to it than the older kaiju flicks. All that being said, the characters are still not huge stand-outs; their emotional struggles are pretty much the only thing we can latch on to, but they remain pretty shallow and flat. Plotting suffers a little as well, given that some parts don't always make sense, and characters don't always make the best decisions. Much like the older films, the story overall conveys a strong theme about the folly of messing with mother nature and abusing nuclear power.<br/><br/>The film is competently made, with quality photography and editing. It is especially noteworthy in the way it masterfully reveals just what it wants to when it wants to, to draw out the suspense and make each monster's presence more powerful. Acting is okay from the whole cast; Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a pretty average everyman hero character, Elizabeth Olson is a pretty average as the guy's wife, Ken Watanabe is an average scientist dude, and Bryan Cranston steals the show in an all-too-small part. Writing is so-so. This production has some great-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Sound design is phenomenal, with monster roars that's guaranteed to make the entire theater shudder. Music is pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Finally, this has got to be the most intense and hard-hitting Godzilla movie since the original. Storytelling and characters aren't a big standout here, but never were in the older movies anyway; this version still offers a phenomenal build-up and a satisfying payoff, and anybody wanting a good monster-movie fix should be pleased. It'll be thrilling to see what directions modern film-making like this will take Godzilla next.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Good | Story: Average | Film: Good)"
"harrietworsey","8","5","9","28 May 2014"," Godzilla the thriller
","The film Godzilla was a lot better than I thought as I thought it would be a complete copy of the last one but it wasn't, it had a great storyline with a twist and an amazing cast who worked well together especially the actor Bryan Cranston who played his part perfectly as you could see and feel all of the emotions that he felt as the character. The special effects were amazing as it demonstrates the passion and enthusiasm of Godzilla and also his strength, as I feel as though it could have completely ruined the whole film if they had shocking special effects. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to see the movie in 3D so I wouldn't know if it was any better. But all in all it was a great film and I would highly recommend it to anyone as it has I little bit of everything in it e.g. action, adventure and a tiny bit of romance."
"Vietboi29","6","5","9","27 May 2014"," Not as good as everyone claims it to be..
","Did I enjoy Godzilla? Slightly. More so than I did Amazing Spider-Man 2, but then again that was a bad movie to start off with.<br/><br/>1. I find Aaron Taylor-Johnsons character to be ridiculously redundant and unneeded. Most likely the only reason why they put him in there was because Hollywood needed an attractive Caucasian character to be the lead. His character is utterly ridiculous, with no goal or motivation. He didn't disarm the bomb, so him being an EOD was not relevant. He failed to warn his superiors that the female Mothra or Muuto is already going through gestation. The movie made it a big deal about how they were seeking each other to mate, once they joined up, their mating only involved the male giving the female a nuclear payload? She could've obtained that on her own. <br/><br/>2. How on earth did they go from Japan, to a carrier, then take a helicopter back to Hawaii? Even military helicopters have a max distance of around 750 miles without refueling, the distance between Japan and Hawaii is 4100 miles. Even if the carrier was half way between Japan and Hawaii, they still wouldn't be able to make the distance on a helicopter. <br/><br/>3. Why on earth would the Muutos and Godzilla go to San Francisco? There are no Nuclear power plants, so for a creature who feeds on radiation, they're going pretty far away from a food source. <br/><br/>4. Ken Watanabe has ""studied"" Godzilla and the Muuto for decades yet know nothing about them. So his character was not relevant as well. <br/><br/>The movie isn't worth the $10-15 that theatre charges, in my opinion it's only worth a $5 discount ticket. The acting was really bad, the only enjoyable moments was the 5 minute fight at the end when Godzilla just wrecked mothra like a boss."
"akheim","5","5","9","19 May 2014"," Where is Godzilla? Get the people out of the way!
","The Godzilla film is very people oriented! I wanted to see Godzilla. If the Movie poster showed a closeup of the young guy and have Godzilla in the background, I would not have been disappointed.<br/><br/>I already read that you wouldn't see Godzilla until the 1 hour mark. 'Jaws' did that and was a masterpiece. I thought this would be suspenseful and have a good buildup. I was wrong. Just as you start to 'get into it', it cuts and goes to another scene. The actors all did a good job, but the film should have made them secondary and not primary. It is not a bad movie though. It just does not live up to the trailers or even that funny car commercial that are strangely more entertaining than the film itself?"
"Zulfmanauthor","5","5","9","17 May 2014"," Godzilla is Big, its a 'Big' disappointment!
","It has been one of the big challenges for 'Hollywood' in recent decades to make a truly epic 'Godzilla' movie. They can make huge disaster movies, with multi-million dollar budgets and an all star cast yet when it comes to this Japanese legend, nothing seems to work. The previous attempt in 1998, was heavily criticised yet was a decent movie with a good cast. Now we have this modern day hugely hyped up monster movie which only offers more of the same. The film seems to follow an over complicated story line which fails to convince and as you wait for 'Him' to finally appear, it's lost in overly long action sequences and poor dialogue. The only plus is 'Elisabeth Olsen' who like most female leads in disaster movies, is under used. I never go into a movie believing the hype or buying into a pre-conceived idea of what it is going to be. I just watch it as a movie comparing it to my expectations based on the genre. Sadly what we have here is no more than an over glamorised B-rate movie with a big budget and a legend it fails to live upto!!!!"
"johnboyjunior","6","5","9","17 May 2014"," Very Disappointing
","*Mild Plot Spoilers* What an utter disappointment this film was. Been looking forward to it forever and the final result is a movie where the Main Character (Godzilla) is handed something that feels like an extended cameo role.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor John-son is a weak lead character here and the amount of time the film spends on him means this film gets boring fast. Bryan Cranston would of been a much stronger lead but he is wasted in this film. Elizabeth Olsen who plays Aaron Taylor-Johnson's wife literally has no reason to be in this film, nothing she says or does is memorable.<br/><br/>The story itself is competent, Bryan Cranston works at Nuclear Plant in Japan, an apparent Earthquake destroys the plant and leads to the death of his wife. Cut to 15 years later and Aaron Taylor John-son(Bryan Cranston's son) is a Nuclear Warhead Disposal expert who has just returned from a tour of duty somewhere. Bryan Cranston is obsessed with finding out the truth of what caused the destruction of the Plant which results to him being arrested. From here the movie tries to build as much anticipation as possible and it succeeds...for a while but after nearly an hour of trying to get us to care for bland, clichéd characters it becomes boring.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe plays a scientist who is seemingly on the trail of Godzilla and after a certain event involving MUTO he explains to Aaron Taylor-Johnson about Godzilla. As you've probably seen in trailers the Nuclear tests of the 1950'S were an attempt to kill him but those failed...the movie then fails to explain why they seemingly stopped trying to kill Godzilla and let him swim the oceans unhindered and without any attempts at tracking him. When the MUTO threat becomes very real Ken Watanabe's character somehow knows that Godzilla will come to stop it despite the fact that the movie leads you to believe that Godzilla hasn't been seen since the 1950's.<br/><br/>The biggest flaws of this film is its insistence on focusing on the Human drama and only showing you the aftermath rather than the action. The first time Godzilla is shown in full he is about to confront MUTO but instead of seeing a great monster battle the film then cuts to Elizabeth Olsen and her son who is watching a news report of the battle the next day. We get to see maybe 5 seconds of Godzilla and MUTO engaged in Battle in this news report and that's it. Then MUTO is about to wreck havoc on Las Vegas and ...cut to to the aftermath. The final battle also focuses more on the Soldiers, who have their own mission to complete whilst Godzilla and MUTO fight it out in the background.<br/><br/>When the end credits rolled I was more than a little underwhelmed by what I had just watched."
"ImKuvira","6","5","9","17 May 2014"," A Godzilla movie without Godzilla
","The marketing for this film was building up the tension and excitement that THIS film is THE Godzilla film we wanted to see in a long time. And... it disappoints. There was so little Godzilla in this movie, the antagonists MUTO was the main focus of the movie along with Ford Brody. All the characters are so one dimensional, Ken Watanabe is a typical scientist, Aaron Taylor Johnson is the Heroic character and seriously I cannot get emotionally invested into this characters because I do not feel for them at all even with the relative amount of screen time. Bryan Cranston,the one so heavily marketed in this movie, dies in the first 30 minutes or so, yet I still feel a connection towards his character because there is something more than ""Oh I'm a Nuclear Scientist! Stop Godzilla!"" motivation behind him. The fights between MUTO and Godzilla in the film, are always anti climatic, just as we are expecting a full on fight sequence but nope,screw you audience lets watch more of Ford Brody's Family or the Army taking the nuclear war head instead of that seriously almost made me fell asleep. That said though, the final fight between the Female MUTO and Godzilla was EPIC, my inner 8 year old screamed in delight. This IS WHAT WE CAME HERE FOR. Just because of the Roar and the fight makes the movie from a 4/10 for me to a 6/10. My final conclusion? Go see it if you are interested for a full 1 hour 45 minutes focused on a soldier. If not, save the money, wait for the the DVD release"
"markr_96","1","13","31","16 May 2014"," Disappointing
","Warning! The new Godzilla movie was so BAD. First of all the plot didn't primarily focus on Godzilla, secondly they didn't even use his original battle cry, and lastly Godzilla was only fighting other monsters for exactly 4 minutes and 18 seconds. (Yeah I timed it, don't judge me). I suppose the movie is decent for a giant monster movie, however this is very disappointing for a Godzilla movie. The movie had so much potential to please both Godzilla fanboys and newcomers but greatly failed. Coming from someone who watched all 20+ Godzilla movies and was inspired to learn Japanese as a result. This movie felt like a slap to the face to the king of all monsters."

","With IMDb rating for Godzilla slowly falling it's actually reaching the objective level, which is unfortunately not the case with all movies. Although i've been acquainted with Godzilla lore, the last movie about it i consciously remember seeing has been the Ronald Emmerich's effort. <br/><br/>On the one hand the new Godzilla is closer to the ""original"" than the aforementioned 1998 movie, involving some scary monsters and vaguely interesting story. On the other hand it is an oversimplification in terms of plot, acting and logic.<br/><br/>To put things in perspective, let me add that i didn't expect anything from World War Z and it turned out to be a fine movie.

","I know this can disappoint people that expected seeing Godzilla wrestling monsters for 2 hours, but I think the way this movie is developed is way more interesting and artistic. Even when we don't see monster until 40 minutes into the movie, the passing is well carried and I never got bored. The CGI and photography was excellent, and the story was simple but makes a good excuse for a very simple premise. The only thing I didn't like, is the military behaviour. Are they really so short minded? would they really act always shooting guns even when it's clearly useless? in the hypothetical situation of something like this happening, would they only think of sending soldiers with guns to shoot? do they have anyone actually thinking in the headquarters? Anyway, I guess is the point of making it a bit stereotyped for the movie.

","Wow, just wow.<br/><br/>To put this review in perspective I like the last Godzilla movie with Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. It was a little quirky, very clichéd but it somehow clicked and I found it quite watchable.<br/><br/>This Godzilla on the other hand was poorly acted, had no coherent storyline and lacked any charm whatsoever. The lead character, Ford, was so wooden he was in danger of getting a bad case of white ant (presumably why they had him in protective gear for a lot of the movie). The writing was simply abysmal, as has been stated in many of the other reviews, and full of plot holes so big you could fit a MUTO through. I mean fancy putting a nuke on a train on the tracks right past a monster that wants to eat it.<br/><br/>The only redeeming point of this movie is that the monsters are big and reasonably well done with lots of destruction, if that floats your boat.<br/><br/>To cap this tedious movie off, you have to sit through over two hours and be left cheering Godzilla on to kill the baddies just so the movie can end. Don't watch it, go and watch the last one again, it will be time better spent."
"rikandum-205","9","8","17","23 May 2014"," Best Godzilla movie! Great cinematic experience!
","THE FOLLOWING REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! Read with caution. First of all, let me tell you this has nothing to deal with the one in 98, the only thing it shares is the title. So, Godzilla was indeed a great movie, I really had a good time watching it on IMAX. They managed to bring back to life a classic monster from the 1950s. The cast was brilliant, Bryan Cranston did the best job, his acting was very well performed in such believable way. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did good too, although in some parts it was not that much convincing, but I think that's more of a writing issue, it's not really he's fault but still, quite good. As for the main character, he always escaped from disaster ""by an inch"", this kept happening again and again throughout the movie, it gets a bit less realistic in the story. The storyline was more based on how they were going to kill the monsters, what are they and stuff like that, which was nice, I think the monsters were well developed, especially the MUTOs, Godzilla kinda came as secondary character, but it's still great because you get to see Godzilla in different scenarios and environments, not just the generic city, and that kills the ""monster in new york"" cliché. It was ironic the fact that in the end of the movie, Godzilla was called a savior of San Francisco, but they were forgetting the fact that Godzilla destroyed all those military boats and jets, and even the Golden Gate bridge, but I understand, if it wasn't for him nobody would have killed the MUTOs, which would have resulted in global disaster. As for the VFX, they were freaking' unbelievable, it looked so good, you really feel the intensity of the battle, it was indeed a great job on the CGI part. I give a 9 out of 10 stars for Godzilla because it's really enjoyable and I really liked it, that's it."

The trailers for Godzilla were captivating and suitably enigmatic.<br/><br/>OK.. Godzilla...<br/><br/>Firstly the script is really really bad with clunky dialogue and bad actors. The bloke from breaking bad, who in the trailers was focused on as the main protagonist..*spoiler alert...dies very early on in the film. I was sat there thinking wtf? It caught me totally off guard. The Japanese guy ken wanatabe or whatever his name is spent the entire film looking miserable and constipated..maybe he was! He was just miserable and confused, very poor direction. His assistant, some actress, wouldn't have got an acting job in a British panto never mind a tentpole summer film. She was so mellow dramatic and awkward. The kick ass guy was OK, better than Taylor kitsch anyway. His wife was awful, out of her depth..she also looked at the camera a couple of times. This is quite worrying as the pair are soon to play sister and brother in avengers 2. <br/><br/>The film jumps around a lot, hundreds of miles of land and ocean are covered in minutes. As stated in other reviews, the film is a very slow burner. You only really see Godzilla later in the film. The monsters and the fights are done far better in pacific rim. I know pacific rim had some awful dialogue, but it also had humour and the fights were engaging. Poor Godzilla with his elephant feet, really I wasn't bothered or pulled into the fight sequences. The film ended abruptly. I was laughing, the cinema audience stood up and looked puzzled at each other. <br/><br/>The 5 points I gave this film, its only saving grace, were for the sets and effects which I thought were excellent. I liked some of Gareth Edwards shots and the way he at least holds the camera steady, but the film isn't good. Some people hated Roland Emmerichs Godzilla, I haven't watched it for years, this film is almost as bad. Sorry, if your a fanboy, you may enjoy it, but anyone else... Its just meh..an OK'ish film."

"guerrerouac","10","8","17","18 May 2014"," Finally Godzilla gets the cinematic treatment he deserves
","It's seldom when a summer blockbuster is able to have a truly emotional and visceral impact when so many modern action films have become consumed by their own relentless cacophony. Finally, Gareth Edwards has succeeded where so many others have failed. He has delivered a carefully paced blockbuster that takes its time slowly unveiling the King of the Monsters through teasing glimpses and escalating action. The movie gradually turns the tension screws until the epic showdown at the end, resulting in one of the most gratifying and euphoric finales I've ever seen in a big-budget film. <br/><br/>Edwards, unlike Emmerich (who struggled with balancing monster vs human geography), knows how to deftly employ the camera to suggest Godzilla's weight, power, and overwhelming presence via framing. He understands that proper use of scale is vital toward enabling the audience to identify with Godzilla as not just a destructive creature, but as a real character with emotional depth and power.<br/><br/>Many critics have criticized the movie for focusing too much on the human story lines and not enough on Godzilla himself. Instead, Edwards focuses on the real-world ramifications of these primordial creatures through the limited lens of the human perspective. Unlike most action directors today who attempt to bludgeon the audience with endless fast cuts and nauseous editing, Gareth Edwards frames the action through a ground level human perspective, which gives us a sense of Godzilla's sheer physical enormity. Often times Godzilla is either partially out of frame or shrouded in smoke or clouds until the final battle when all hell breaks loose. While this teasing approach may irritate some moviegoers, I appreciated this return to an older style of filmmaking that emphasizes subliminal wonder and an unraveling sense of scope rather than just empty, aimless bombast. The film's dark tone and atmosphere lends the monsters a real sense of menace. As they exist mostly out of frame, it emphasizes the human struggle to comprehend forces far beyond our myopic understanding. <br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's excellent score features many percussive elements and traditional Japanese sounds that harken back to the classic monster movie tradition, which should please die-hard Godzilla fans. Its oppressive themes bring out the tension in each action setpiece, while taking a backseat during the quieter moments in the plot. In the acting department, the performances were mostly solid across the board. Cranston adds much-needed gravitas to his brief role, thereby establishing the human stakes that are later eclipsed by the epic proportions of Godzilla's conflict with the MUTOs. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a serviceable performance as the lead protagonist; he merely serves as the audience's entrypoint for understanding the geography of the monsters' movements and fights. The background actors sometimes veer into hammy territory, but it works for this type of movie (a throwback to the classic kaiju genre). <br/><br/>I had an absolute blast watching this movie at the cinema. People were nearly stomping on their feet by the time Edwards delivers the climax we were all waiting for. It's one of those rare films that knows what the audience wants, but doesn't squander its potential to inspire awe and wonder in the audience by overstuffing itself with mind-numbing action and self-serious drama. Gareth Edwards has proved himself to be a hugely talented director with this seamless transition from independent to blockbuster filmmaking with real heart and soul."

It's an old fashioned monster movie in the truest sense. There's no story, the dialogue is shallow and only meant to push the plot along, and the acting borders on the melodramatic. But the real genius is how it has the feel of Godzilla from the 50's, achieved in part by the 3D effects that help simulate the backdrop special effects of yesteryear. Even the music is reminiscent of the over-the-top scores from the 50's. (Maybe Alexandre Desplat, the busiest composer in Hollywood, will finally win an Oscar.) It uses modern technology to give the feel of an old black and white summer popcorn flick. Brilliant! Younger and unsavvy movie goers probably won't get it, but it seems perfectly clear to me what they're doing here. This doesn't mean the special effects don't look good; quite the contrary. The monster and destruction scenes are edge of your seat thrilling! A movie like this would never be nominated for best picture, but in a certain way it probably should be for its achievement in throwback film making using modern sensibilities. Genius!"

","I saw this with a friend, who liked it a little better than I did. He's just a hound for Godzilla films, and he loved it. I like old monster films, but this is the 21st Century, and everything is different now. But I admit I was impressed. We can't believe in floppy rubber suit monsters anymore; but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy some good old monster bashing when it's done well. And I think it is here.<br/><br/>The FX are very good - but this is not just another comic book FX romp. I actually came to feel for the Big Green guy here. And while I didn't quite feel so deeply for the humans, I think they (both the characters and actors portraying them) did what they had to do under the circumstances - they were all quite believable to me. <br/><br/>As for the action - I can't believe anyone found the first part dull; it isn't monster-ridden, but it segues into the monster action quite well. And there's more to Godzilla himself here than some critics are reporting. <br/><br/>There are lots of memorable moments through-out the film. The moment when the MUTO walks by the while the soldiers are lying on the bridge trying not to be noticed really had me on edge. And I won't spoil the final battle, but it's a keeper.<br/><br/>I found the whole very riveting and entertaining. It moves well and is well made. That the heaviest action moments are played out between the monsters but seen through the eyes of human observers worked well for me. I really felt like I was there, I saw as much as I needed to, to be thrilled and entertained. <br/><br/>And that's the word for it - entertainment. ""Citizen Kane"" this ain't, but it's a great movie for chills and thrills (and frankly there ain't many of those these days). The old Big Green is back - and he's cleaning house the new style way! - What more could you want from a giant monster movie for Godzilla's sake!"
"winner55","10","8","17","16 May 2014"," Godzilla's story (now that's entertainment!)
","Going into this film, I only wanted an entertaining B movie that honored the Toho series I grew up with. And I am completely satisfied with what I got.<br/><br/>Because of the enormous amounts of money spent on genre films these days, many people are under the illusion that 'B movie' is a derogatory designation. That is nonsense. Some of my most beloved films are B movies - wonderful adventure thrillers, action fests, horror stories, westerns, mysteries. Sure there are B movies that excel and leap into 'A list' territory (e.g., ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly""). But there's nothing wrong in making a great B Movie - A lot of films by such as Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock were put together with no greater desire than to entertain a ticket buying audience. That's all a B Movie has to do.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" does that grandly. It IS a B movie; so is Hawks' ""El Dorado"" or Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" So it is in good company. And (like all great B movies) it is very entertaining.<br/><br/>Edwards succeeds partly because he has designed the movie to look like a movie. This is not a visual roller-coaster ride. No shaky-cam or MTV editing here. The sometimes quick closure to action moments, like with Godzilla's first meeting with the MUTO, are clearly intended to bring the audience to the edge of their seats demanding more. This did not work for some critics, but it worked for me. I never felt like I was getting less than I wanted.<br/><br/>Also, the pacing was far stronger and more rapid than many reviews had led me to believe. The narrative drive, once one grasps the real narrative, is utterly relentless. And what I mean by that is, the real story here is not about any of the humans. This movie is called ""Godzilla,"" not because he's on screen most of the time (he's not, although we see him far earlier than any of the critics have reported - like in the title sequence) or because he's the 'main' monster (he's not that either, although he plays a much more important role than the others do); but because it's HIS story - it's HIS conflict, and, being THE agent, HE has to resolve it. (The MUTOs are important because they are part of that story, and it is partly their story as well - and they are terrifying, BTW.) Edwards shoots this story slightly off-center, through the eyes of humans trying to cope, only because he has a human audience to play to. (If the audience were all just radioactive lizards, there wouldn't be a human on the screen. But it would still be the same story.)<br/><br/>BTW, all of the critics complaining about the somewhat undeveloped characters here have missed the big boat. Whether consciously or not, Gareth Edwards and his team have achieved a remarkable conceptual construction here, staggering in its simplicity and audacity. They have grafted a ('90s) ""Heisei"" era Godzilla story (see, e.g.,: ""Godzilla and Mothra Battle for Earth"") onto a 1950's era Hollywood science fiction film - think ""Them!,"" Pal's ""War of the Worlds,"" or the original ""Thing from Another World."" As I watched these characters struggle to come to grips with their monster problem and still get on getting a job done, I kept thinking of the scientists and soldiers facing similar problems in '50s American sci-fi movies, responding in similar ways with similarly compressed explanations and suppressed emotions. Edwards makes up for any lack of depth to these characters by keeping the perspective on the monster action as close to humans experiencing it as possible - much the way that the directors of the '50s did. The complaints against Aaron Taylor-Johnson, missing this point, miss the finesse of his performance - he is doing what Edwards wants him to do, standing in as 'Everyman' avatar for the audience (much like James Arness in ""Them!""); any stronger performance would have been distracting.<br/><br/>But the main story is of course the monsters'; that also has been missed. The humans are witnessing the culmination of a conflict beginning millions of years ago. Consequently, they are merely annoyances for the monsters who are enacting their ancient struggle for natural resources. This drama is in fact a fluidly unfolding whole, which critics who try to impose a classic '3 act' structure on it fail to see. This film has a prologue, the narrative certainly has connecting episodes, but there are no 'acts' - once in the present day, it just goes.<br/><br/>Which is why the finale is actually quite satisfying. For the real protagonist of the film, with the big fight over, there's no need for a wrap-up - and surely no need for commentary from those pesky little hairless apes, who don't have the slightest clue as to what's really going on in the world they think they dominate.<br/><br/>What more need be said? Like the '50s sci-fi movies it so heartedly evokes, the dialog is sometimes silly and cliché. The photography and design are solid; the music is not at all dull, it is supportive of the visuals without drawing attention to itself (which is a classic '50s era soundtrack composition rule-of-thumb, BTW). The CGI is state of the art (I saw it in 2D and it looked great). And there are a lot of 'Holy Crap!' moments that are truly memorable.<br/><br/>And did it pay homage and honor to the source material, the original series produced by Toho, 28 films over 50 years? Absolutely. The story is very ""Heisei"" era, and as good a reboot as ""Godzilla 2000."" For a kaiju eiga junky, this film is seventh heaven. Highly recommended without reserve - and take the kids to see it, preferably at a drive in with lots of popcorn. (That's how I first saw Godzilla - memories are made of such as this.)"
"romrot-mechanikos","10","8","17","15 May 2014"," I just watched Godzilla! An Imma Review it.
","Anyways without getting into to much of the plot I'll just say that this was better than the Godzilla movie from the 90s because yay no Mathew Brodrick. Yeah Go back to voicing simba Ferris Bueller! You stupid idiot...ahem I don't hate Mathew Brodrick, he's just a really boring bland actor. In this new Godzilla movie we get slightly less bland actors, yeah! No but seriously the people in this movie act more like human beings with real emotions. I had to look up the actors names, but Bryan Cranstan, who looks an awful lot like Liam Neeson(if you don't know who Liam Neeson is then ;p) Bryan Cranstan was the guy in the trailers who seemed like the main character. *spoiler* He is not the main character, Godzilla is! *spoiler* No seriously the movie follows that dude and his son, who was like kind of like Shia lebeouf's character in Transformers, except this guy is in the military. Still it's kind of funny, optimus-Godzilla! lol. Anyways The movie begins slow, at first it's all like Jurassic Park, then it's like Alien, Then it's like THESE PEOPLE EXIST! Then it's like and so do these monsters. and yep...at the beginning of the movie they established that not main character guy and his son Shia le'not'beef sure exist, for too damned long! That is one of my problems with the movie. I get it we set up characters to feel sorry for when bad things happen to them. But I came to see monster gosh darned it! And when the monsters were finally on screen the movie was amazing from thee I won't talk about the plot, but it was pretty awesome.<br/><br/>My only problem is this. So the military sends a small group into a city where the monsters are, and well. my question is. Why were the soldiers armed with AK-47s? What is a puny gun like that going to do to a monster the size of a skyscraper? You'd might as well through paper clips at the monsters, because your tiny bullets won't do much to hurt them. Like seriously I get that the soldiers should be armed, but really how is a little gun gonna do anything? like why not a bazooka or grenades something with a bit more bite than a rifle. Whatever.<br/><br/>Anyways my suggestion is to go see it! Now, drop what you are doing buy a ticket online and go now. If you don't have money steal it from a homeless guy. Sell your body into prostitution for the tickets, I don't care how you get into the theater you just really need to see it!"
"delores-rockett","10","8","17","16 May 2014"," Godzilla, they finally get it right!
","I read a review (before going to see the film) that brought up the point that this is a film about Godzilla and not a Godzilla film. If you can decipher that, then you are on the right track on what to expect. I read another review on here that the ending was unexpected that Godzilla swims away. I had to laugh, did he/she not watch any Godzilla shows in the 70's? lol. Well, it was the perfect ending as it was just like the films of old.<br/><br/>I think the film starts out kind of slow.I do understand the need for some of the back story, but I think they could have cut out some of it. But, once the action started up again, it got very exciting.<br/><br/>One person said Godzilla was badass in this film. I disagree with his assessment. He kind of reminded me of Rocky. But he is the good guy and he won in the end. I wanted him to be more of a badass than he was, but hopefully the sequel will bring him back stronger than ever.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are a lifelong Godzilla fan, this movie is for you!! And also if you can, see it in 3D!"
"cnickels13","3","8","17","16 May 2014"," The Correct Title: A Movie with a Cameo from Godzilla
","While the graphics were great, the movie itself was not. The title of this review says it all. ""A Movie with a Cameo from Godzilla."" If you're hoping to see Godzilla (the movie) to see Godzilla (the creature), well, this isn't the movie for you. Watch the originals. Godzilla might have a whopping 45 minutes of screen-time in the whole 2 hour movie. The trailers and previews are not representative of the movie. I think the other monsters (I won't spoil this part) had more screen-time than Godzilla did. I was not happy with the movie and won't recommend it to anyone. It was a mis-titled movie with great graphics, but a somewhat boring, dragged out story line. The only positive I can provide is that Godzilla saves the day. And then, he's gone."
"fridaynightdestination","8","8","17","16 May 2014"," The Most Badass Godzilla You Will Ever See
","Godzilla was awesome. Now, now, it isn't perfect, but overall it was extremely entertaining. Lets dive right in. Also, the movie actually shows the title in beginning! Most movies don't do it till the end or not at all! That annoys me! So here we go.<br/><br/>First off, the story was interesting. I enjoyed seeing the military action that took place against Godzilla. David Straharin and Ken Wantabe played an interesting role in it. Now the film definitely follows the role of Aaron Taylor Johnsons character named Ford Brody. He is in it for almost every scene. Ford Brody is an interesting character. You do wanna see him get back to his family. You wanna see him and wife meet again. But by the time it gets to the end you don't really care about him and you can guess why. The whole government conspiracy was interesting, and Bryan Cranston played a very interesting role in that.<br/><br/>Acting- The acting was good, mainly from Bryan Cranston. While he won't win any Oscars, Bryan did a very good job with his character. Ken Wantabe did a very good job and so did David Stratharin. The beautiful Elizabeth Olsen did a good job. So overall, good acting.<br/><br/>CGI- AMAZING! WOW! I FELT LIKE I COULD REACH OUT (and touch faith) THE MONSTERS!<br/><br/>The MUTOS- Yeah, the other monsters, something I have been curious about seeing for a while. I mean, WOW were they badass. I wasn't sure if I was gonna like them, but they are badass and terrifying. Little kids that are gonna be brought to this movie aren't gonna be scared of Godzilla. They are gonna be scared of the MUTOs.<br/><br/>Godzilla- Yeah, the reason why we came to see the movie. How was he? AWESOME! They portrayed him so well. While it would have been nice to see him more, every second he is in is badass. And the very second after you see him that is a second of not seeing him, you want to see him again. You just want to see him AGAIN AND AGAIN! The movie does make you be patient, but the final act delivers. This movie has the most badass Godzilla you will ever see.<br/><br/>Visual Style- The Visual Style of the movie was very nice. Very good cinematography. <br/><br/>3D-Well done. Not the best 3D I've ever seen, nowhere near of the level of this years The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or 300: Rise of an Empire, but the 3D still delivered, especially in the rainy scenes.<br/><br/>Here is quick pros and cons<br/><br/>+ Godzilla is badass<br/><br/>+ Great soundtrack<br/><br/>+ Amazing CGI<br/><br/>+ Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson) is actually likable<br/><br/>+ Bryan Cranston<br/><br/>+ The MUTOS were awesome<br/><br/>+ Good 3D<br/><br/>+ The Last 30 Mins Is AWESOME<br/><br/>+ The Atomic Breath<br/><br/>+ The Way Godzilla Is Portrayed<br/><br/><ul><li>Not Enough Godzilla</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Story Starts Off Nice But Once It Gets To The Final Act It Gets Boring</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Another thing that it needed more of. If you've seen the movie you might know what I mean.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A Lot Of The Shots and Scenes of Godzilla are short.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It Gets Slow</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, while it can get slow and boring and it needed more of the title monster, Godzilla is overall a very awesome, entertaining, and badass experience that needs to be seen in IMAX 3D. Godzilla is a very good film that would make Ishiro Honda proud. 9.0/10"
"mrcs_dede","9","8","17","15 May 2014"," Let them fight
","I rated Godzilla 9/10 this was Epic. Even though it was barely godzilla in the movie it still lived up to the hype for me. I was actually expecting this movie to be OK but not great but the acting was good the story the directing. For the director to only have one movie under his belt shows that if you put your mind to it you can create a fantastic movie. Walter White isn't in the movie much but when he's there he makes us want to hear him say ""say my name"". The Olsen sister did a pretty good job and kick ass did a good job as well even though he was mono tone but he was the main character in the film. I don't want to spoil anything but when Godzilla fights it's epic but you wish there could be more kind of like pacific rim had but it teases til you get the final showdown at the end where he goes on full brawl head to head like he's in a WWE match. Another thing that was great in this movie was the score. The music had me getting goose bumps it was monstrous which I'm sure it was intended. The guy from inception was kind of my favorite character because he knew what was going on with nature and man and the metaphor with the movie is that godzilla is a god a watchful protector a dark knight lol just kidding I had to say that but yeah godzilla is meant to help and is the hero of the movie. You won't be disappointed but just know if you want to see more godzilla then this is not the movie for you but you should see it because it makes you think what if it happened"
"ZeeRaaN","3","8","17","15 May 2014"," I thought new movies should not repeat cliché from other movies!!
","***a lot of spoilers**<br/><br/>let me start by saying this movie was visually perfect. a big thumbs up for the people behind the visual effect,cinematography, sound editing, mixing..etc. BUT !!! i really hope the writers paid as much attention as well !!! <br/><br/>the story line is ridicules !! full of cliché. and i will list some of them. <br/><br/>we follow this family in their journey to feel compassionate with them!! but usually the family we follow has a significant role on the movie's plot direction!! the whole Brody family had no big role at all. ""Joe Brody"" played by Bryan Cranston, lost his wife because of this sudden unexplained earthquake that triggered the nuclear plant. he felt responsible so he took it upon himself to figure the reason out (until now we are OK). 15 years later... he is still trying to figure out!!!!!! and it doesn't feel like 15 years. he is still obsessed like it happened yesterday, yet has little new clues!! (not worth 15 years). so he tried to trustpass to his old house and so he got caught by the police, so his son had to fly from America to Japan to bale him out!! (no idea why cant anyone else do it). when his son arrived to his apartment he saw that his father is still obsessed from the ""newspapers and photos hanged all over the apartment's walls""!! (why does every obsessed guy in movies does the same thing!!! whilst in real life no one really does it!! ). they both tried to go back to the house to get this very important data (which were not important at all) and so things got complicated and the father lost his life because of this (for nothing). the Japanese doctor had all the answers and was the main source of information, so i still don't get the role of Joe!!!<br/><br/>i then had hope that at least the son ""Ford Brody"" will have the important role because he feels bad for not believing in his father, but no !! he did nothing worth saying as well!! at the end, the whole city got destroyed, thousand of people died and Godzilla saved the day!!!!<br/><br/>there are so many other clichés that i totally get in older movies but i cant pass them for newer ones!! writers out there ... be more creative... a little bit more. like for example, when a kid entered the train without his parents and Ford Brody took him and promised to get him back !! (not necessary nor heartwarming). or when the entire army were firing ""tiny bullets"" on the monsters!!! (you expect more logic). or when they went back to the house after 15 years and saw the happy birthday sign hanged up (really!)...<br/><br/>I personally liked the cast acting except for Aaron Taylor-Johnson in his portraying of Ford Brody. I thought his acting was fake and the least convincing. (i mean its a monster, you should be really scared)<br/><br/>again, the only reason I'm very disappointed on this movie is that it is a 2014 movie. and i think that new and especially big budget movies should know better by now. our standard is higher now. in 10 years when we see this movie we will laugh at the visual effects (like we do when we see old movies now) and only the story line will remain."
"kepotaz","4","8","17","15 May 2014"," Going through the motions of a monster movie
","There's plenty to love for fans of special effects and monster mayhem in general, but for those who want to see a good original story there's hardly anything there.<br/><br/>Technically it's a well made movie that navigates through all the necessary story beats for this kind of movie, but it lacks personality or soul. The characters aren't interesting or have much of a personality - they're basically just stereotypes instead of real people - and because of that it's really hard to care what happens to them and so the whole movie becomes uninteresting. The actors do plenty of emoting, looking teary eyed at each other or at the mayhem around them and there's lots of personal tragedy etc. but it all feels lifeless.<br/><br/>There's some impressive visuals in the movie especially near the end when Godzilla & co. really lets it loose, but sadly these gorgeous images are hollow because the story is lacking. The visual part of the movie is the only inspired part. The story just goes through the motions of a stereotypical monster movie with some themes of nature's balance or whatever thrown into the mix to justify the special effects."
"jan_kalina","10","9","20","3 June 2014"," ""You're not fooling anybody when you say, that what happened was a ""natural disaster,"".
","Monsters Reloaded. That is what essentially Godzilla is. Gareth Edwards simply upgraded his film debut with a dose of a bigger budget and a famous brand stamp. Monsters is a film that relies on the atmosphere and the kind of documentary camera. More than anything it is a character study and a long tease before you see any aliens. But that's exactly the way to build suspense.<br/><br/>Now with a bigger budget Edwards has a chance to let himself run wild and stuff his film with plenty of action scenes .. only some people might be bothered that they don't involve the title character. All the monsters in the film are here just to serve as the background, to paint the broader bigger picture. In the same way as, for example, in The Perfect Storm - the natural disaster serves as a background for the story.<br/><br/>The film boasts an impressive cast, but some of these actors are seriously underused. Sally Hawkins just simply stands around doing nothing while being a female counterpart to Dr. Serizawa. Speaking of him, this character, played by Ken Watanabe, has got to be one of the most WTF characters ever to grace the screen. Most of his scenes have him gazing into the horizon with a terrified/confused face or spout exposition dialogue, because he is a scientist and Japanes. Therefore out of all the characters he has to know most about Godzilla, which equals satisfied Japanese audience. Bryan Cranston gives a stellar performance with his limited screen time. Main actors are Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. Johnson as Ford Brody, a soldier and bomb disposal expert, has a simple task to get back to San Franciso and save his family. His character has all the character traits I would expect from a solider, so no complaints here. However Elizabeth Olsen shapes up to be more than just another pretty face in the film industry.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards made a film that might not meet everyone's expectations. But if you go along with the take and the direction this film is taking, then I'm sure that you will enjoy this not very typical run-of-the mill ""summmer blockbuster"".<br/><br/>P.S. What is most promising about this film is the director. The way he builds suspense will remind you of early Spielberg films. Some images are also reminiscent of Spielberg (train on fire, bodies in the river, conspiracy theory obsessed character), Edwards doesn't show the carnage, he shows you the consequences through the little bit of the puzzle, so you can work out what happened yourself. I just can't wait what to see what Gareth Edwards cooks up for his next film because out of all these young talents, he is shaping up to be the most talented."
"abcvision","10","9","20","31 May 2014"," his name is godzilla
","The highlight for me of this movie was when Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) seriously makes the statement, ""They call him Godzilla"" as he shares the tale of this urban legend. In this movie, after a nuclear reactor meltdown it awakens a roach looking creature in Japan. This creature seeks to mate and travels the world looking for radiation and its male counterpart. In comes Godzilla, ready to save the day with its fire breath and larger body that tears into major cities as it fights these two larger ""cockroaches"". The effects are pretty amazing as downtown Las Vegas and San Francisco are destroyed, the power grid failure makes you sense how vulnerable our modern apparatuses can be. Our military seems amateurish as it seeks to destroy these threats. Many scenes are reminiscent and pay homage to past Godzilla renditions when you see folks running and stopping in their tracks as they yell out ""Godzilla""."
"BigWigs","10","9","20","19 May 2014"," A must see on the biggest screen possible
","This is a Godzilla fans dream come true. This was everything I had been hoping for in the 2 years I had been waiting for this movie. They did this right.<br/><br/>Now like any movie, it has its flaws. The human side of the story did not live up to its potential. Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston's characters were wasted and did not get the screen time they deserved. These are two great actors with lots of potential who could have done so much more in this movie. Another problem is that it had been said that this movie was going to take a very realistic approach. They wanted to show what would really happen if giant monsters were attacking Americas cities. However, I did not get this feeling from the movie. The reactions from onlookers seemed incredibly underplayed and not very dramatic. Now this is okay, but I came into the movie expecting what they had promised, and I didn't get that.<br/><br/>HOWEVER. If you are a Godzilla fan of any kind, or even just a casual moviegoer who enjoys some good action. This is so for you, and it is worth every penny to see it on the biggest screen possible. It is a slow and steady build up, that will have you on the edge of your seat just waiting for the inevitable.. and oh boy is it amazing. The third act alone makes this movie a 10/10 for me. My theatre burst into applause at the end, and you could hear the ""holy crap"" and ""oh my god"" at certain parts coming from everyone there. Also, the cinematography in this movie is breathtaking. It was simply a beautiful movie to watch.<br/><br/>So, as a movie itself, I would give this an 8/10. But as a Godzilla movie, and coming from a Godzilla fan, this is a 10/10, and fills my spot for second favourite Godzilla movie, first being the original 1954 classic."

","I'll start by saying I have not seen many of the original Japanese ""Godzilla"" series, but enough to know that the 1998 ""Godzilla"" was a travesty, not only to the source material, but to the general public as well. Shallow character development, cliché comic and plot elements, everyone staring at the horror in front of them instead of running, and the inept military causing as much or more damage as Godzilla . . . I could go on, but I want to push that wreck of a movie even further back into the depths of my memory, because ""Godzilla"" 2014 is a movie to remember.<br/><br/>No spoilers from me, go see it. They take very few cheap shots throughout the movie, and most of them are in the 'announcing' of plot elements or character introduction, where it's allowable. The acting isn't superb, the characters aren't tremendously deep, but they aren't laughable and do not distracted from the plot at large, even help it along carefully. You get total immersion with this movie, and I didn't really find any distracting moments that broke my concentration. I give the movie a 9 out of 10 because the first half, maybe a bit more, is a little slow, but makes up for it as it gets nearer and nearer to the climatic finally. The whole audience applauded when the movie was over, and my brother and I are already planning on seeing it again. This may be among the few movies I purchase digitally or ad a DVD and add to my library to watch once and a while for kicks.<br/><br/>Look, Hollywood, I'm a huge sci-fi fan, I'm a published sci-fi author (""The Terrans of Beta""), and I hate how horrible you people molest amazing stories to give them more cinematic, dramatic impact, at the sacrifice of quality characterization and captivating plots. You did well with this one though, and I'd like to see more. Here's hoping this movie is a blockbuster-hit, to lead others to follow its example. There is room for improvement even with this movie, but it's so much better than the normal fare out there that I'll support it with my patronage and public acclaim. Keep it up, please. We are willing to reward you for your effort if you provide the level of entertainment ""Godzilla"" 2014 delivers."

I found there was one moment in the film that completely summed it up for me so there has been news reports of these giant creatures having a bit of a smack down The camera then follows the flying creature as it flies past a office block and what do we see in the office block people sat at there desks i mean seriously in full suit and tie sat at there desks. Now i am aware that there are people who don't watch the news anymore but seriously you might have heard about the 3 bloody giant monsters kicking the crap out of each other and thought you know today i am not going to work. I mean if you didn't turn up whats gonna happen after the giant monster apocalypse your gonna get fired. Lots of things in the films where utter rubbish but that bit really irritated me that the director decide there would be people sat a filing, was this to add a sense of dread that these people where gonna die. Well in this humble reviewers opinion i did not feel dread for these people i just thought of Darwin and if these people where stupid enough to get out of bed they deserved dying by Godzilla's fart rant over I'm gonna go watch a man in a rubber suit destroy Tokyo"
"gta3stop","1","10","23","22 May 2014"," Worst movie so far in 2014
","I don't write reviews but for Godzilla I'll make an exception because of how disappointed I was with it. Bryan Cranston's character is NOT the main character, has a minimal role in the movie, and really the first 30 minutes of the movie that feature him could have been removed from the film entirely. Also, a lot of pointless back story. The Japanese scientist brings up Hiroshima to a Navy general in a very forced manner that adds NOTHING to the movie other than giving it a faux deeper meaning or morality or some crap. All of the acting was TERRIBLE. This may very well be the first film I've seen that did not feature a single good actor or actress. Also, the monsters are only on screen for maybe 30 minutes and that's a liberal estimate. This movie is NOT about Godzilla. Finally, the worst thing about the movie was its plot which was entirely nonsensical - the transporting by train, the Golden Gate Bridge scene, Yucca Mountain - nothing in the plot made any sense at all. Horrible, horrible, horrible movie. Stay away from this junk."

","Best thing about this movie was the watered-down diet Coka Cola I drank. If the movie had been free I would have demanded a refund. The best thing I can say about this movie was that it was boring. Very boring. I could hardly stay awake. My wife described it as the most boring movie she has seen in a decade, and I would have to agree with her. Frankly, half way through the movie I began to wonder if we were in the wrong theater since the only monsters that had appeared were the 2 MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), male and female. Although Godzilla's fins had been seen a few times earlier, It was almost a relief when Godzilla finally got out of the water to do a little fighting. Frankly, if I were you I'd rent the old 1954 Japanese Godzilla. Just an aside: in the original movie the older people remember when virgins were sacrificed to Godzilla to appease his wrath. Probably would have improved this movie to sacrifice a dozen virgins or so."
"osariyurt","1","10","23","21 May 2014"," Unimaginably bad
","There should be a couple of things in a movie to satiate an average sci- fi fan and those are not rocket surgery. Throw some fiction type action, destruction, combat (preferably close) into the fray and all other things are secondary if you want to keep that audience seated until the end of the movie. This movie fails on all of it.<br/><br/>There is yet to be an explanation about how the titular monster only appears around 15 minutes during a 120 minute long title and I include the scenes where he can be seen only partially, possibly only legs or spikes. There can't be any slight excuse or justification to take Godzilla away from the majority of the movie and filling it with worthless primary and side characters of whom the audience do not give a damn about. All human characters seems like to have learned to act in kindergarten and not gone further ever since. Unimaginably poor acting except Bryan Cranston (who dies at the beginning of the movie!) is all the audience meets when the expectations spike to see Godzilla or other monster wreaking havoc on city.<br/><br/>You won't see Godzilla until the second part of the movie, and even after that everything is poor. Action scenes are not bad but they are so scarce and dark. Speaking of which, why it has to be so DARK? Like, all combat scenes, especially the grand ones take part in night time, in cloudy weather and a powerless city bombarded by EMP blast(which is not also a big deal visually) and two VERY DARK monsters wrestle in the ruins in VERY awkward motions? I mean come on, the only illumination seen in the final scenes of the movie is Godzilla's flame breath (which is used only TWICE and only takes around 4-5 seconds in the FULL MOVIE). There is nothing special about the 3D either, in fact there is no 3D at all. I don't know whey they bothered to film this in 3D, but I honestly wonder why did they film this puny excuse of a Godzilla movie in the first place!<br/><br/>Oh and did I mention that there are only THREE combat scenes in the entire movie and TWO of them actually cut short before they just began, the first one is seen in a television, second one is cut short right before real action begins in a clear daylight and third one is the only combat scene, which is incredibly dark like I've mentioned above.<br/><br/>Characters are poor, storytelling is INCREDIBLY bad, there is no proper background to the other monsters in the movie, let alone Godzilla himself. Plot holes are enormous, like humans intend to detonate a nuke 32 kilometers offshore but instead localizing on Golden Gate Bridge! Also someone in the army stating that ""Hiroshima nukes are toys compared to this one we plan to detonate"" but that goddamn bomb explodes only miles away from the San Francisco shoreline. Let's say that people and the city survived the initial blast, what about the radioactive fallout of a bomb with that magnitude?<br/><br/>Finalizing, everything is wrong and illogical about this movie. Logic is irrelevant in a proper sci-fi movie which achieves to entertain a usual sci-fi audience, but this thing is not a good Godzilla movie, not a good sci-fi movie, not a good movie at all and I actually detest myself to call this abomination as a movie because there are so many other good examples in sci-fi category are actually called ""movies"", this thing must be called something else.<br/><br/>Also I have my sympathies for Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe to be included in this monstrosity."

","This was one of the worst movies I have seen or for that matter ever seen. Godzilla was on the screen for maybe 20 minutes out of the whole movie if that much. They had these two flying dinosaurs creatures looked sort of like Rodin in a lot of the movie. The 3D was awful. The storyline was the most boring storyline they could have possibly written. The movie went no where. Main character was dead 1j/4 of the way thru the movie. A lot of scenes showed them with guns like that would help do anything at all to Godzilla. The idiots were trying to hide from him on the bridge and what do they do, shine a light on him ...genius. At the end all of a sudden Godzilla isn't a creature Japan wants to kill instead he is treated as some hero. The original Godzilla is now turning over in his grave. Obviously they got me for 16 bucks..I rarely go to the movies now a day and after seeing this it confirms how awful Hollywood has gotten. Many of the cut scenes also show there faces looking up and just standing there like a deer caught in the headlights even though Godzilla was 10 feet away from them. I can't believe someone in the post gave this movie 3 stars. I'd give it 0- 1/2 a star at best. Do yourself a favor stay away as far away as possible. You've been warned."

"shanayneigh","5","6","12","24 August 2014"," We followed the wrong character
","This review contains spoilers for Godzilla (2014), Executive Decision (1996) and The Village (2004).<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I can sort of understand the film makers thinking ""wouldn't it be cool if we kill off the best known actor in the beginning of the movie"" for pure shock value. Kind of, but not exactly, like when Steven Seagal (who, believe it or not, was kind of a big action star back then) was killed a half an hour into ""Executive Decision"", or when Joaquin Phoenix was stabbed in ""The Village"".<br/><br/>But in those movies the shift of focus worked, because the characters had motivation. Kurt Russell was a fish out of water, desk jockey analyst in a tux (""Who's this? Double-oh Seven?"") trying to stop a bomb going off in an airplane before it's too late. Bryce Dallas Howard has to leave her little tight-knit community and venture out into the unknown woods where monsters reside in order to get medical supplies before her loved one dies.<br/><br/>In Godzilla I wished we would've followed Bryan Cranston's character because the movie sets up some kick-ass motivation for him where he tries to unravel the secret behind why he had to sacrifice his wife. But instead we follow his son which could've worked if, for instance, he slowly but surely takes on his estranged father's obsession, a slow descent into madness where tries to unravel the mystery that his father tried to solve in order to avenge both his parents. But he doesn't even seem that upset or sad about the death of his father (who he doesn't seem to care that much about in the first place), he rather has a look of weird annoyance on his face a second after he watches his father plummet to his death. That was really the best take they could find?<br/><br/>But instead we get a generic military character who specializes in bomb disposal, something which is emphasized throughout the movie, but has absolutely no effect in the end. He has a generic family with whom he shares a scene, but if you'd delete the family scenes from the movie absolutely nothing would change. What's his motivation other than ""going home""? Why is he suddenly back in the military fighting monsters, and why are we as an audience following him specifically instead of the thousands of other random soldiers? And he's not exactly a fish out of water as he's former military to begin with.<br/><br/>Him being the son of Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche makes no difference to the character. You could easily delete the entire prologue and Bryan Cranston's character altogether, and substitute Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character with Josh Dumahel's from the ""Transformers"" movies and it wouldn't make a difference. They're both generic military characters whose motivation seem to be ""I'm military, and this is what we do"".<br/><br/>This Godzilla was such a wasted opportunity. I absolutely loved Gareth Edward's previous movie ""Monsters"", a master class on how you work with a shoe string budget (the documentary on the blu-ray is definitely worth checking out), so I was most definitely looking forward to his version of Godzilla. But maybe my expectations were set a bit too high.<br/><br/>Godzilla is by no means a bad movie. It's well made, with some good effects and excellent sound. But it's quite dull. It more or less plays like a computer game where the main character moves from one action set piece to the next: Stage 1 - Japan, Stage 2 - Hawaii, and so on. You never really care for any of the characters, and we are never given any motivation for why we as an audience even should care about them, so there's nothing at stake."
"edgereviews","9","6","12","28 May 2014"," A Near-Perfect Blockbuster...
","'Godzilla' is directed by Gareth Edwards, who directed the 2010 independent movie 'Monsters'. I think that 'Monsters' is a masterpiece, and one of the best directorial debuts that I've ever seen. Because of 'Monsters', I had very high expectations for 'Godzilla', but I always knew that it would be a very different type of movie than 'Monsters', so I accepted that it would be different along with the fact that I probably wouldn't like it as much either. I was correct in my assumptions, because while 'Godzilla' may not be a masterpiece like I think 'Monsters' is, it's still an incredibly entertaining movie that's more intelligent than most other major blockbusters.<br/><br/>I'll get the main negative out of the way first, and that's that the characters are pretty weak. Most of them don't have much to them, but this didn't bother me that much because let's face it, you don't go and see 'Godzilla' for the character development, do you? The characters aren't distractingly bad anyway, they're just passable. The main character, Ford Brody, is a perfectly competent lead, played very well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, but it's his father, Joe Brody, who I would argue is the best written character in the film and is put to great use by the always phenomenal Bryan Cranston. Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins are good as well, but I was slightly let down by Ken Watanabe, simply because his character really didn't allow him to show much of his great acting ability.<br/><br/>Many people may be disappointed by the fact that Godzilla isn't actually in the movie a whole lot, and that this film focuses more on the human drama. I definitely appreciated that aspect, as I always like a good story over excess action, but this movie still had the amazing action sequences to compliment the excellent writing. I actually found Godzilla not being in the movie that often was very effective, as when he does appear on screen it's all the more impressive.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is made to be seen on the big screen. Don't shrug it off and wait until it comes out on DVD, go and see it in the cinema because that's the best way it can be viewed. There's one particular moment in this film that's so incredible and awe-inspiring that I would name it one of the best cinematic moments I have ever experienced, and there are various other moments where my jaw just dropped, which is something that very rarely happens in a movie. The VFX are flawless, all of the action feels like it has actual impact and isn't just mass unnecessary genocide like in 'Man Of Steel'. The sound design is impeccable as well, there are many points where I had goosebumps because the creature noises are so perfect. Gareth Edwards is obviously a very talented director when it comes to monster movies, as 'Godzilla' maintains the excellent cinematography and intense tone that his previous movie had. The score by Alexandre Desplat is great as well, I'm not always a big fan of Desplat's work but his music perfectly accompanies the movie.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards hit the nail on the head with this film. It manages to create a grounded version of Godzilla without being so dark and gritty that it's not enjoyable. It's a movie that both fans of Godzilla and people who aren't familiar with Godzilla should enjoy, because it's a near perfect blockbuster."
"benjaminspetrofsky","5","6","12","27 May 2014"," EXTREMELY Disappointing. Don't fall for the hype.
","I am a huge Godzilla fan. I have been since I was kid, so obviously, this film had been on my mind for quite a while before it came out. I was very excited, hoping for a rejuvenation of a classic series. I was wrong. In no way is this Godzilla comparable to the original, both in terms of the contents of the story and the message the film tries to present. <br/><br/>First, I want to start with the fact that Godzilla only appears for a few minutes in the film. Many people who are praising this film are comparing it to ""Jaws,"" saying that it's comparable to the idea we never see the shark to the end. I'm sorry, but ""Godzilla"" here has no resemblance with ""Jaws"" in that sense. In ""Jaws"" we are introduced to the shark the first five minutes of the film, we just don't SEE it. ""Godzilla,"" on the other hand, revealed the existence of the monster 2/3 into the film, and only showed the monster in its completion for a fragment of that. Those who compare this to ""Jaws"" are incredibly misguided and don't understand what Spielberg tried to do in ""Jaws."" He wanted us to be aware of the shark's existence, just he didn't want to show it right away. Spielberg didn't introduce us to the shark at the end. I don't mind the fact we don't see Godzilla in his completion till later, but what I do mind is holding back the EXISTENCE of Godzilla in the plot to the very end. It makes me feel like this film should have been called ""MUTO"" than ""Godzilla,"" since the film was more about the MUTOS it seems.<br/><br/>The fact that they dropped the nuclear warfare message was quite disappointing. Instead, they replaced this theme with a theme of nature and balance, an interesting topic to explore, however, that's just not Godzilla. Godzilla is historically recognized as an anti-nuclear warfare symbol. Stripping Godzilla of that quality is completely destroying what Godzilla was all about.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was SO BAD I could barely stand it. The only good performance in this film, was, of course, Bryan Cranston, but he, just like the monster, has very, very little screen time. A major ball buster. Everyone else, including Aron Taylor Johnson, are unbearably flat and expressionless. There is no emotion being expressed, and the facial expressions made remain the same it seems. The emotional content was simply not there. I wanted to care for these people and the disaster they are going through, like in the original, but this version didn't offer that, instead it only gives us 2D characters with little personality.<br/><br/>However, there are the good parts. The CGI, as you would expect, is amazing. I don't understand the complaints about the CGI, but whatever. And the final fight, as short as it was, was quite epic and exciting, and creatively done. Now, if they did this later on and had the story develop faster, the rest of the film could have been equivalently good.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, I found the 1998 remake of Godzilla MILES ahead of this one. The 1998 version was not exactly a good film, but compared to this, it's like a Stanley Kubrick film. <br/><br/>For those of you looking for an epic rebirth of the series, this is not it, unless you like bad acting and waiting to long to be INTRODUCED to our main monster. I though this film was called ""Godzilla,"" not ""MUTOS."". Go watch the original ""Gojira"" instead, it's a classic that will never be topped. Hopefully, if there will be another Godzilla remake in the future, they will be more faithful to the original meaning of Godzilla and have better actors.<br/><br/>Really is not worth the time or the money. A major let down for those looking for an epic rebirth of our favorite monster.<br/><br/>5/10"

COME ON!!! I'm not usually one for big brutal fighting monster movies etc but with these effects, the 3D, and Godzilla of all monsters man I was expecting a far more intense battle than what we got. Bryan Cranston's character and scenes felt so unnecessary by the end, like it was just chucked in to fill time which sucks because I love him as an actor. Ugh I better just stop now.

","Watched this film in 3D - Big mistake. Watched this film Bigger mistake. I loved the earlier made Godzilla version as it had a lot of drama and action. The first half created and launchpad to a great action/adventure second half but it has a heartbreak in the end. There is not a single character to withheld the storyline/plot. Joe Brody the scientist who spends so much time researching about the subject dies suddenly as if he did not have time to shoot for the film. His son Ford who now takes up a higher role has no role to play in the movie. He is really boring and his actions are predictable. Dr. Ichiro Serizawa who looks so deep by his face has no philosophical dialogs nor a technical solution to the problem rather than bending of a Monster Godzilla to save the earth from 2 unknown monsters. The film shows that Godzilla is the real hero of the film and he knows about the birth of other two monsters from his sixth sense.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the film could have been interesting with a sane storyline and dialogs. CGI was good but it was so dark as if the color corrections were done to hide the glitches. <br/><br/>You may watch this film on your 32 inch TV/laptop while saving some precious bucks."
"iridiumfan","3","6","12","18 May 2014"," A Disaster of Epic Proportions
","This movie was my most anticipated movie of the year. And as a long time fan of Godzilla, I walked away disappointed. This evening's viewing of Godzilla evoked a strong enough reaction in me to post my first ever review. To put this in context, in 23 years of cinema-going, I have never physically given ""the finger"" to a movie I have watched (no, not even Phantom Menace!) In the third or fourth last scene from the end, I gave this two fingers. At that point I couldn't even control the impulse to do so!<br/><br/>Without spoilers, what's good? Any scene involving Godzilla. What's bad? Everything else. The trailers suggest this as a dark reboot of Godzilla, a la Nolan's Batman Trilogy. Aside from 12-odd seconds of HALO jumping, it's not.<br/><br/>***HERE BE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>To elucidate: <br/><br/>The Good: The scenes involving Godzilla are visually spectacular. The destruction caused by Godzilla and the MUTO's (by themselves, or when fighting) is truly of epic proportions. The carnage and mayhem caused - even by these creatures' arrival(s) - is just what we expect from a monster movie, and is truly satisfying. Godzilla himself is pleasingly remade in the image of the originals; and the scene where he roars at the female MUTO was honestly terrifying!<br/><br/>The bad: It seems that everyone involved in this movie first conceived the climax scene (everything from the HALO jump onwards), and then reverse-engineered a story to lead up to that point, without worrying too much how it went together, or if it made sense. The story is stilted and disjointed, the dialogue is mediocre, and and the inter-personal relationships terribly clichéd and weak. All of them.<br/><br/>As an example of the relationships: I didn't remotely buy into Elizabeth Olsen's character of Elle Brody, who seems to have been written by someone who has never been in a relationship themselves. Even worse, Elle seems to have been written as one-dimensionally as the paper on which the script was typed: she has no depth as a character, and oddly seems to switch from a insightful and capable person, to a blubbering damsel in distress. ""Do I go to the shelter now? Or do I wait for Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to come and save me?"" By that point in the movie, I really didn't care. Part of me hoped she died, just for a jarring emotional reaction and a sadly poetic ending (Ford's father failed to save his own wife). But in true cliché style, despite being in the thick of fighting, she survives so we can have a happy ending (ignoring the thousands who actually died)...<br/><br/>Certain things can be written off with the Hollywood ""Rule of Cool""; other things could be forgiven as minor research errors; but when things defy logic, it doesn't matter how cool the monsters are, the movie falls flat on it's face. Ignoring minor gaffs like trying to pass off Hawaii as the Philippines, I've listed the key things below that stick out in my mind from tonite's viewing (mainly so I am not accused of merely trolling as I've read elsewhere). Don't read these unless you've seen the movie.<br/><br/>* Reactor meltdowns don't work that way. * You can't outrun an explosion of that magnitude in an enclosed area. * Where did they walk to? China?? * Why did no Government, Regulatory, or Military body think to ask the Chief Engineer of the plant - who happened to be at ground zero (and survived!) - what happened, or collect any of his data?? * Unconsciousness is now a convenient plot device. * When an oncoming tsunami destroys the city in Hawaii, it somehow fails to break the glass windows or doors of the conveniently open shop that the family with a little girl take shelter in seconds before (because no children died anywhere else in the world either). * Even though Ken Watanabe's character continually refers to it as ""Gojira"", for no apparent reason, the Americans decide to start calling the creature ""Godzilla"". In front of his face. Even the much-maligned (unfairly, IMO) 1998 version of Godzilla accounts for this disparity (quite well, I might add). * That's the youngest looking 69-70 year old person I've seen in my life! * Why, when a *BABY* MUTO's arrival is presaged by tremors and destroys a nuclear plant, causing devastation to the surrounding areas, does no one even notice the hole caused in the SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN by another MUTO - later shown to be around the size of Godzilla - as it departs, until they open a door??? Or even as it strolls casually away towards Las Vegas???? This is the point where the movie finally lost all credibility to me and just became more and more ridiculous. * Ford walks up to a solder and claims to be an officer in another branch of the forces, so they promptly give him a weapon and equipment. Hmmm...I must try that at my local army base some time... * Unconsciousness can now stave off drowning!!! * BTW, EMP's don't work that way. * FYI, the scene I gave the fingers to was the one where the female scientist (name pretty much irrelevant) reacts emotionally to Godzilla's departure. The scene was so ridiculous my friends were laughing out loud at it.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's more, but why continue beating a dead horse?<br/><br/>If you want a fun entertaining monster movie, watch Pacific Rim, or the '98 Godzilla, or Jurassic Park, or Jaws, or Eight-Legged Freaks, or...you get the idea. If you want two hours of BUFFOONERY, interspersed with some visual brilliance, watch this.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 3/10 from me based solely on the above-mentioned monster scenes. Otherwise a big stinking ZERO."
"starlimitz2","9","6","12","17 May 2014"," The Monster is Attacking the City!
","A fun ride through and through. A clear improvement on the American franchise of Godzilla. The plot is very well outlined with not only our giant lizard friend, but also tell the story of a Naval Bomb Disposer, and his journey to get back to his family. The acting, while not the greatest ever seen, was well portrayed.<br/><br/>It was quite the wait through the first thirty minutes of the movie. It was very well worth the wait. The suspense is built up until the bursting point, and it was paid off with a show that could only be described as devastating in a wonderful way. Godzilla is a commanding presence as he should be. This time, they got his character design correct, as well as his character as a whole. <br/><br/>While their sequencing can lack here and there, the movie does very well in its payoff. The human tale is very gripping entertainment, but it is augmented by the presence of a true King of the Monsters. Definitely a great start, now on to the next!"
"inuyasha-616","5","6","12","17 May 2014"," Disappointment
","Godzilla was a movie that I wanted to love, believe it when I say , I sat in the theater fully engaged within the story. The opening 30 minutes was superb and really built the suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat! Bryan Cranston's acting was amazing as I expected it to be, he nearly brought me to tears when expressing the loss of his wife and the will to know the truth to Ken Watanabe's character. And when his character dies, I really felt the movie was only going to get better. I thought, hell if they are going to kill the main focus of attention presented in the previews other than Godzilla then this movie will surely become an amazing experience unseen in the mysterious trailers and previews. <br/><br/>The design , sound, and purpose of the MUTO's were excellent, they really did seem to be terrifying. <br/><br/>People had fears that the story would be too americanized and I can safely say it was not, as the first hour or so of the movie took place in Japan. The characters explained his Japanese roots and that they dropped atomic bombs to try to kill him, which did not work. It really had a ominous feel to it all, the anticipation for seeing Godzilla was huge at this point. It really made you feel like when we do finally see him , he will be featured in an epic scene cause destruction on a colossal scale.<br/><br/>The suspense that has been built for about an hour has led to a scene where the flying MUTO wrecks havoc on Honolulu, the excitement is real. Godzilla makes his grand appearance causing a massive tsunami. Here it is, the first time we will see the King of Monsters. The camera pans from his foot to his face , he roars. Godzilla's design was amazing, held true to the original Japanese design and his roar was loud and terrifying. And thats it. <br/><br/>This is the point where the movie became a huge let down. <br/><br/>Instead of a grand destructive introduction to Godzilla, the scene is then cut to show a part of the initial battle on TV, which I did like, but it showed nothing more! I do not know why this was thought to be a good decision on the part of the Edwards. If your going to inject humor into an otherwise grand introduction to the most anticipated monster movie of the century why not then show the rest of the battle in real time on camera !! This literally killed the excitement of seeing Godzilla! <br/><br/>A very good example to feel what I am talking about is imagining your watching Jurassic Park and instead of an amazing introduction of the T Rex wrecking havoc , we just see the t Rex roar and the camera cuts to a different scene! <br/><br/>Despite this initial let down , I set there staying loyal to my feelings that this movie will become amazing, seeing the UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OF NATURE do what he does best, destroy buildings and indirectly saving humanity by fighting monsters to defend the earth at his own terms. <br/><br/>Nope. What we get next is a scene where Godzilla is swimming ALONG with the Navy . <br/><br/>Then we find out that another MUTO is in the movie , thank god I thought, maybe we will see some destruction. <br/><br/>Nope, what we get is yet another tease, where the monster attacks for a bit on screen and we are left , again , to see the aftermath while it is attacking in the background . A trait that the rest of the movie will follow: focus on humans on screen while monsters are destroying in the background. <br/><br/>We are teased further more throughout the movie with scenes of monsters fighting on t.v. while the camera focuses on the human soap opera. <br/><br/>We have a scene of Godzilla being shot at by battle cruisers and he does nothing but walk away . <br/><br/>We are shown the MUTO terrorizing the city , Godzilla makes another grand appearance , instead of showing the battle , they cut to another scene.<br/><br/>The problem here is not the story, the story is very good ! The problem is the execution . The deliverance. The movie showed many time , clearly , how it could have been amazing, the director had all the skills and tools he needed. But for some reason instead of the neutral unstoppable force of nature that the previews made him out to be. He was simply a ""ally"" for the American army.<br/><br/>Amazing CGI . Excellent Acting. Good Story . Shitty deliverance ."

","Being a fan, I expected some good old cheesy fun like you get from the older movies with the exception of the first movie. The first film from 1954 is very gritty and dark. The series changed a lot as it progressed over time, becoming a pop icon of fun. Much like Pacific Rim. The movie was nowhere near amazing, but it was fun. I came into this pseudo-sequel expecting the same thing. I never expected it to even touch the greatness of the original film, but my expectations were beyond exceeded. I'm more than willing to call this movie a tour-de-force of science fiction. A masterpiece. I'm writing this in the perspective of a person that doesn't like the genre, even though I do. The story of this movie moves along through the people affected by the destruction brought on by the monsters. You have an immediate connection and attachment to everyone you meet in the film. Even the minor ones. When it comes to the time of action (monsters begin wreaking havoc), you witness some... A lot of dark, realistic, extremely vivid, terrifying, and serious events. These scenes were so vivid and realistic, I could picture these types of things happening during the drive home just by looking over the rainy, misty horizon over the trees beside the road. Best of all, the people operating the cameras are not conformists. They do not use shaky cam like everyone else in action movies these days to get things done cheaply. You see everything from start to finish as if you're looking with your own eyes in the multiple settings of the movie. You really feel as if you're there. Everyone, I mean, everyone in the theater was on the edge of their seats. That's a phrase that has become overused this day and age, but it's literal. You could not see any member of the audience dozing off or not panicking. Yes, panicking. People were grabbing their hair and clenching the arms of their seats in the theater. This is no lie, because I was one of them. The director, Gareth Edwards, is someone to look out for, because his visuals in this film are breathtaking. There is no way to describe the suspense this movie brings to the table. Everyone from the catering to the makeup department deserves some award. Gareth, as I said, was phenomenal as a director. You really see some key angles and movements that could easily take him to a high level of fame. The cinematographer, Seamus McGarvey (a veteran), really took this film to the next level with his stunning work. I could see him receiving a third Oscar-nomination for this. I really could. The plot was solid, a lot more convincing then I could have imagined. I was a little disappointed in the script by Max Borenstein at first, but his screenplay escalates to the heavens when it comes to plot points - where the movie takes wild turns. I was very satisfied with the way the story translated from the script to the screen. If I could write down on paper what this man saw while writing this, I would pack my bags and move to Hollywood right now. I really hope to see more from everyone involved in this picture. This was only the crew, however. The cast surprised me. I didn't expect such a well performance by Aaron Taylor-Johnson or anyone else. Except for Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe. They're legends. The actors' reactions to the events presented in the film are just moving and engaging, because no character here is bland or similar. Overall, you can tell I'm highly impressed with this film and I cannot wait to watch it again. The only negative thing I have to say about the film is the odd ending, but I won't spoil anything. I think you'll get the ending issue as well. I hope they're planning to make a sequel. If they do, I'll be there."
"bowmanblue","5","4","7","11 January 2015"," Godzilla really needs to get himself a better agent
","Okay, I can see it from his point of view... if I was a thirty-storey tall lizard, I would accept that I wasn't going to get that many offers from Hollywood producers. It's not like Godzilla could star opposite Jennifer Aniston in a cute, cuddly little romantic comedy. So, when the 'king of monsters' got an offer to star in a Hollywood retelling using his very own name as its title, he must have jumped at the chance (possibly causing a minor earthquake in his city).<br/><br/>However, what the poor misguided monster didn't know was that his role in the film was little more than a 'bit part.' The producers probably mentioned that they also had the great Bryan Cranston on board, fresh on the back of his success in 'Breaking Bad.' I don't blame Godzilla for being optimistic. He probably expected to be engaged in numerous deep and emotional scenes with the man who played 'Heisenberg.' Yet it turned out that he was merely duped. The trailer for the film made it look like the two of them would be carrying the film together. How wrong they were.<br/><br/>For a start, Cranston isn't in it much as the trailer and marketing would suggest and, secondly, you hardly get to see the monster! The film is two hours long. For the first half an hour we have Bryan Cranston. And, as you'd expect if you've watched Breaking Bad, you'll know he's awesome. He has the drama and screen presence (or at least right kind of manic nuttiness) to hold your attention. Then he goes out of it. So, does the monster take over? Well, not really.<br/><br/>We see Godzilla's back. Sometimes we see his thighs (and, yes, he is looking a little 'out of shape' after being off our screens for so long). And occasionally we hear him roar. However, every time he's about to open up a can of whoop-ass on some bad monster, it reminds me of that scene in Reservoir Dogs where Mr Blond tortures a police officer and the camera pans away. This happens every time in Godzilla. As soon as the action starts, the camera cuts to something on the other side of the planet (kind of literally – if the monsters start a fight in Tokyo, the action switches to San Francisco).<br/><br/>Yes, the end of the film (and by that I mean the last quarter of an hour of a two hour epic) you get to see the monsters finally get stuck into each other. But, between Bryan Cranston leaving the film and the 'HALO jump' right before the final stand-off, there really isn't much to keep your attention. I sort of get what they were trying to do. I'm sure the producers would call it 'building up tension,' but they take it a little too far. Imagine a Terminator movie where they only had the titular cyborg in it for give minutes. How well would that work? Oh, wait, they did – Terminator: Salvation. And how well did that go down?! I hear they're already thinking of making a sequel to Godzilla. I just hope the titular character gets his representatives to actually negotiate more screen time for the poor guy."
"thomas-w15","7","4","7","22 November 2014"," Acting is subpar but special effects save the film
","Godzilla 7/10- We all know that the 1998 Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was a total train wreck and a pointless remake doing nothing except attempting to copy the original with no success. Now, since I have not seen all of the original Godzilla, I will not make any comparisons. Having said that, the 2014 Godzilla is a good stand-alone film that features near ground breaking special effects plus top-notch acting from supporting actor Bryan Cranston. <br/><br/>Aside from the acting from Bryan Cranston, the rest of the acting was sub-par at best. Then again, Bryan Cranston is a great actor and anyone who is compared to him in this film will be put to shame, so I will try not to be too harsh. Still, I expect the other actors to at least try their best and it seemed apparent that in some of the scenes that demanding good acting, they did not. <br/><br/>The plot was hard to follow at times, but that may be because the trailer was not bad, but misleading and has you searching for a different path while the movie keeps giving us all of these twists and turns. What I liked about the plot though is that Godzilla was not the only monster, he was not the only possible antagonist. In terms of choosing those types for the other antagonists, I felt like they could have done better since giant mantis looking dinosaurs are not very appealing, but this is all just my opinion. <br/><br/>I will not go over much of the acting since most of the movie is special effects, but I would like to give a couple spotlights. Bryan Cranston, as I said before, gave a powerful, literally astounding performance that owned every scene he was in. I was a little worried that he would not be able to set himself aside from Breaking Bad, but no need to worry, he is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now and he shows that in this film. Aaron Taylor- Johnson did nothing special in this film, but it is hard to blame him since he was in the heavy special effects scenes. The only performance I really did not like was from Elizabeth Olsen because she just did not sell the role of her being a loving mother and wife, the same with Aaron Taylor Johnson in terms of father and husband as well. They are both very young though so I think it would have been smarter to either get older actors or to have the couple but not the kid. The rest of the cast did average but again their is only one Bryan Cranston. <br/><br/>Now we venture to the best part of the film, the special effects. WOW, that is how I describe the special effects, WOW. I have not said that since Avatar. Just the shear size of Godzilla is something that really leaves in audience in awe. Then adding two other dinosaur/monster characters to the mix really gives the action scenes a lot more depth. I do not want to spoil the part that the entire audience agrees is the highlight of the film, but trust me the final part of the film, the final action is so good that this part alone is enough to see the movie. <br/><br/>To put it simply, a lot of tremendous special effects with some fine acting with Bryan Cranston makes the movie very enjoyable to say the least. I definitely recommend Godzilla as your choice going into the theater if you want to see top-quality action film. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"
"Rickting","8","4","7","15 November 2014"," A monster smash
","This seems to have divided people a lot. Some have found it to be entertaining monster mayhem while others have panned the human characters and lack of Godzilla. As for my opinion: Monster movies aren't just about smashing skyscrapers. They're meant to be intense and scary. Godzilla really does that, and it makes the monsters frightening. It also brings in some of the key themes of nuclear age commentary from the not great original. Godzilla is accidentally released due to nuclear testing and goes on the rampage, while 2 other monsters crush America at the same time. Some humans try to stop the destruction. While I disagree with many of the criticisms, it's true the humans leave a lot to be desired although to be fair so does the Japanese original. Bryan Cranston is the star of the show. He's excellent in the movie. So naturally they kill him off in the first act. The rest of the humans aren't very interesting. Aaron Taylor Johnson, despite his strong performance in Kick-Ass, plays a wooden leading man with less facial range than Godzilla who is so boring he feels like a parody of boring action heroes.<br/><br/>The film doesn't show Godzilla much, but few have understood that that is a good thing. It makes the movie more intense and scarier. Gareth Edwards makes the transition from low budget to big budget with ease, and the movie is filled with stomping, romping monster movie mayhem. It's visually stunning and genuinely scary. The script isn't the worst ever, and it's a good monster movie storyline which pays tribute to the original while also bringing Godzilla into the 21st century. By the sound of it it's far better than Roland Emmerich's version from 1998. The movie forsakes fun for gritty thrills and this will divide people, but at least it actually felt scary and still delivered the sobering commentary on nuclear testing. It is incredibly rare that I would say this, but I prefer this version to the original since the original was anticlimactic but this version got bigger and better. Godzilla is a good movie which shows what monster movies are meant to be about yet people still criticize it for trying to be scary. What do filmmakers have to do to please the fans?<br/><br/>8/10"
"Spondonman","6","4","7","9 November 2014"," Monster Fail
","I had to do something else less important so decided to watch this with half an eye to save time. Even that was a waste of time as I got nothing from it at all in nearly two hours. They spent USD 160 million to make a poorly executed, grimy coloured, dark and hopelessly inadequate b film and made a profit! And some highly paid film critics actually praised this – all I wonder now is how much they got paid for their misleading recommendations. The only good thing is it kept a lot of talented people in a job, including the highly paid critics too I suppose.<br/><br/>It starts fairly well as a Close Encounters rip-off, a man and his son trying to get into nuclear power station the brass hats have put out of bounds claiming ridiculous radiation poisoning for some lying inexplicable reason. They're soon let into the secret as the secret breaks loose. The remaining ninety minutes drag by in grimy darkness, with admittedly great sporadic cgi cartoonery – although there were far more stretches of dark with only farty noises which reminded me of the great Fred The Oyster and other sound effects from the Goon Show. Apart from periods of incoherent messiness the character, monster and plot development was nil; at least in the original Godzilla everybody and everything was cardboard and more real. My own favourite was Godzilla vs King Kong, what was yours? This sentimental-macho techno-hokum may be pleasing to the psyche of modern Japanese viewers but personally bring back The Prince Of Space or The Neptune Men anyday.<br/><br/>Did I mention the dark griminess, only broken by the depressing dysentery green of everything? John Wayne made Iwo Jima look like Paradise compared to this non-splendid vision. It's probably the worst film I've half-seen for ages, doesn't do what it says on the tin, and may leave you with eye-strain."
"heroicconman","6","4","7","22 September 2014"," wow the trailer fooled me
","Great effects, if only I were allowed to see them in action.... and not the acting of this main character who throughout the whole movie was unable to make me feel interested in his part of the story as well as his family. Then for the monsters who were hardly ever shown and if they were they were shown in action in the dead of night where you could hardly even make out what was going on. The dad character at the beginning was the only character worth getting interested about and they end of killing him off a quarter way into the movie even though the trailer leads with him for some reason, my guess being hes such a well known actor compared to most of the rest of the cast. So with the poor use of good actors and great special effects as well as the bad scripting, I'm gonna have to go with a 6/10; and that's only because I'm a Godzilla fan boy."
"cool-an2011","5","4","7","19 September 2014"," A systematic process of disappointment:You have been tricked !
","Godzilla has always been a great raw heroically violent character which we enjoyed as kids , and as teenagers in the earlier movies ...but it has not always been this way as adults ! (maybe we should blame adulthood for it :D) <br/><br/>As the movie starts you get really provoked and interested with high expectations of this great masterpiece ... and this feeling actually progresses as the first 40 minutes of the movie pass , with the appearance of the veteran badass Brian Cranston and the intriguing plot and the twist that kills your interest and gradually kills the movie afterwards (the death of brian cranston) ... its as if they tried to trick the viewers that : hey look at all the interesting visuals and the strong lead actor , oh nope just kidding we are gonna kill him and replace him with a weaker dull actor which if he acts well -and he didn't- will just be dancing over the disappointment of the dead body we have just thrown in the river ,as i see it it is just a cheap trick to lure more audience into seeing the movie and making more profits because we all love the epic Breaking Bad meth millionaire , which bugs me most about it.<br/><br/>Now lets try and ignore this part and assume that the movie isn't just about the lead badass actor -which was in the movie ""Unknown""but thats irrelevant anyway- and lets move to the technical part which includes cliché plot about the ""great"" U.S army who acts like a bunch of dummies for someone who really pats an eye of common sense and logic and actually checks details -which will need another review lol-, especially the all U.S army thing and the great lieutenant who just wants to protect and save his family and the saint act of saving that hawaian kid ..it seems as if they have forgotten that the movie is actually about GODZILLA not the supreme U.S army and its miraculous abilities and acts ... if the viewer wanted to watch such thing he would have picked ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Saving Privet Ryan"" but am sure that is not what the viewer looked for in ""GODZILLA"" , and then moves to the other cliché melodramatic scenario of the family Reunion , and lastly ends up with a disappearance of the main character of the movie while perusing the un-interesting human part<br/><br/>all in all there was one bright side of the movie which is the great monster fights alongside the visuals and big scale scenes which were executed very well,not to mention the great firs 40 minutes and the outstanding brian cranston acting which made me give that movie a 5."
"Gerryt22","5","4","7","20 August 2014"," An interesting film that features a Godzilla cameo
","When I say giant green lizard monster what is the first thing that comes to your mind? Well Godzila of course! Now if I said giant green rage monster then that means I'm talking about the Hulk. One thing about the Hulk and his recent films (Ang Lee's Hulk and the reboot Incredible Hulk, with the exception of The Avengers since he's one of the many stars) we get to see what we came for, THE HULK! <br/><br/>Now this is a MUTO review..... oh wait.... never mind! This is a Godzilla review! Meaning we should have had a good amount of screen time for the king of monsters. Sadly we barley get to see our giant green star of the movie. We ended up getting more MUTO screen time than we did Godzilla. The film does, for a time, a good job with slowly building up to Godzilla however by the time an hour and a half rolls by they seem to have taken a bit too long to do so. <br/><br/>The lacking direction keeps teasing something big only to then cut away to something silly and unnecessary. Monster battle is about to go down but first watch this scene where the main character helps a little boy find his parents! A Monster fight just started to go down but first watch this scene with a kid watching the fight on TV! This goes on and on and on and it becomes aggravating that every time something interesting happens the scenes cut to something else. <br/><br/>When it comes to monster films one of the most common issue are the human characters. This film suffer that same problem and more. These actors work with what they have but in the end we feel no interest for the problems they have to deal with. Sure we need characters to emphasize with but these characters we just not strong enough. <br/><br/>Now let's forget the humans and go back to what's important... GODZILLA! With all these issues one things for sure the moments we do see Godzilla truly delivers. The action scenes with Godzilla fighting the MUTOs were visually dazzling and fun to watch. The special effects in this film is without a doubt just spectacular. The best best looking Godzilla we've seen yet.<br/><br/>This is a film I'd recommend that you just skip to the end of the film. Godzilla is what it is, a missed opportunity. The intention was to revive Godzilla to the new generation of film goers but seemingly fails to. What's a film without it's star? Director Gareth Edwards has apparently set himself up for a possible dilemma. He has announced that there will be a sequel. This film spent the entire film, and literally the entire film, to set up the king of monsters. I hope that the director learns from this film mistakes and can actually give us a Godzilla film that features... Godzilla. <br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>-Gerry T"
"JackSoloFrost","4","4","7","3 August 2014"," Lacks characterisation and dialogue
","So in this Godzilla I can safely say, nothing ever happens. Some monsters awaken, the monsters fight and then the winner goes to sleep. The humans in this film do nothing, they had no affect on anything, in fact if you think about it, if the humans had done nothing the death toll and radiation toll would be smaller. But that isn't why I didn't like the film. I didn't care about the humans, I had no feelings for these characters that never say anything, the entire film is heavy breathing guy, scared girl, kid, open-mouthed Japanese man, and explaining girl. The only two characters you like, whose dialogue combined equals more than the rest of the film, both die before the 40 minute mark. Oh how boring. But I guess if all you want to see is special effects and big monsters fighting then this is the film for you. The 1998 Godzilla may have been awful but as least it was funny and had Jean Reno which is more than I can say for this film, in this film the french actor lasts 6 minutes."
"charliegeeza","6","4","7","23 June 2014"," Good start, good effects, but shallow and weak story
","Godzilla is almost like 2 films in 1. There's this gritty, emotional beginning with very good acting and generally nothing to criticise. Then it moves into phase 2 which is great special effects but the acting and dialogue was left at the door. It's almost like Michael Bay usurped the production crew about 1/3 of the way into the film.<br/><br/>OK, so you probably heard that Brian Cranston is in this film and he is great as you might expect. His character's son, played by some dude who might remind you of Keanu Reeves only with less talent, simply pales in comparison. The problem for the film is that it is the son who is the main character. He was so bad that, on the drive home from the theatre, I was unable to recall a single one of his lines.<br/><br/>Whereas the first part all make sense - and even threatens to be intelligent as we get various concepts and scientific notions tossed our way - whilst at the same time endears Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to the compassionate viewer, the second part of the film abandons all logic and reason as we track Ford Brody (some dude) and the army as they make bad decision after bad decision along the way in a series of forgettable and clichéd scenes until we finally get Godzilla in all his glory.<br/><br/>Godzilla truly, though, is glorious. The special effects are excellent with only the occasional iffy moment. If you are watching the film for Godzilla, then you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the rest of us, it does appear that this was scripted just when the writers went on strike? Sorry, I'm just speculating as to why 1/3 of the film is very well written and the latter 2/3s of the story/script is appalling."
"Robert_duder","7","4","7","3 June 2014"," Interesting nod to the iconic monster but not altogether perfect
","I like to think I had moderate expectations when it came to this newest iteration of ""Godzilla."" I saw some people comparing it to Pacific Rim and excited because of that. I thought Pacific Rim was very near garbage so I was definitely hoping for more than that and I did indeed get more than that. There are some really good things about this summer blockbuster. The Special effects were very impressive. I wasn't annoyed or found myself rolling my eyes once at the CGI. That, in itself, is a miracle. The CGI and monsters and destruction were all excellent. I saw this in 3D IMAX and it was a lot of fun seeing it in that aspect. Another good thing is the fact that this hearkens back to the old school 70's and 80's ""Disaster films."" It introduces you to the characters, establishes the story and you feel the tension building as you know the disaster is coming. As many reviewers are saying the tension builds...verrrry slowly. It takes a long, long, long time to get to Godzilla. I'm all for establishing story but they do take too long to get around to what everyone is there to see. They do it well and the anticipation is good but its just a tad too long.<br/><br/>The cast are all good. This is a bit of a con to the film. They are good...not great...in fact no one really stands out in the cast. The best of them would be Bryan Cranston in his first post-Breaking Bad role as a driven and obsessed scientist determined to convince people of the impending disaster. Cranston is very good and then...well...spoiler alert...they write him off like cheap trash. I was very nearly angry that they just completely cut him off from the film without any real good explanation and with very little emotion. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is really the focus of most of the movie and he is just okay at best. He's come a long way from KickAss fame but he just feels almost bored in the role and lacks the charisma to carry the movie. Elizabeth Olsen was so impressive early in her career with Martha Marcy Mae Marlene and then just seems to flap around looking for where she belongs ever since. She is sort of whiny and annoying in this and isn't in it much and the chemistry between her and Johnson is okay at best. One of the best roles and the least used was Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I would have rather he carried the entire film because at least he showed proper intensity. His only expression was intense fear and it worked for the most part.<br/><br/>Surprisingly Gareth Edwards is fairly new to directing projects but he has a long history with special effects. He has created something that is impressive for a number of reasons besides the special effects. This iteration of Godzilla did what 1998's reboot did not even try to do and that is pay homage to the origins of this iconic character. Godzilla is inadvertently heroic, there are hidden easter eggs throughout (Mothra's tank for instance) and the fact that Godzilla is not pitted against the humans but rather other beasts and humans are just in the way. It is a massive battle unlike anything I have seen in a very long time. It was like Man Of Steel's hour or more long final battle only this made sense because you had several massive creatures destroying the city. Godzilla is ultimately pure fluff but it was entertaining and a great popcorn flick. It would be a great movie to see curled up in your car at the drive in. It was entertaining but lacked real depth and a good cast which holds it back from being truly great. I look forward to seeing a sequel but I expect this series will only struggle to really take off. 7/10"
"p-stepien","5","4","7","2 June 2014"," Garguatuan delivery of monsters, lax drama
","Gareth Edwards reinvigorates Godzilla on the American soil with his gargantuan portrayal of the famed post-nuclear monster, which retreads the origins of its fame and imprints them within this big-budget modern-day extravaganza. Even Godzilla itself diverts form the T-Rex blunder of the 1998 movie and captures the big-footed original monster of the Japanese series in CGI perfection. However Godzilla is not the sole malevolent creature to appear in this movie, as the famed mega-predator enters into a all-destructive chase for another humongous kaiju (or MUTO as it is defined in this movie) with a devastating EMP blast. <br/><br/>In the midst of this epic battle humanity and the army struggle to contain the destruction, while Edwards, like in ""Monsters"", struggles to imprint human drama as a backdrop to events. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a scientist at a nuclear power plant, loses his wife (a brief cameo by Juliette Binoche) to one early attack by the MUTO, thus becoming obsessed with the monster and the encompassing government cover-up brought in effect to hide the truth. As a character and as an actor Cranston is a short-lived emotional highlight in the story, which unfortunately soon loses traction with what feels like his premature death. This loss leaves us battling for interest in the lax son of Joe, demolitions expert soldier Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is a bland shell of a character, generic to the extreme, effectively keeping us disinterested in the story and leaving us hoping for a fast-forward to more massive destruction of metropolis. MUTO expert Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and the wife-nurse Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen) are equally unengaging, dull as a dishwater and forgettable. The overall lack of character imprint into the story coupled with audacious coincidences littering the movie, make the drama inert and feel like an important position on Edwards' checklist of blockbuster movies components.<br/><br/>I did however immensely like as Edwards slowly builds tension, initially only showing massive bones of the leviathan creatures or just the aftereffects of their presence, then only sifting through bits and pieces of destruction through news reports, whilst avoiding showing the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs, leaving space for total San Francisco annihilation for the final act. Nonetheless with the lack of emotional engagement ""Godzilla"" feels like but a mild success, a poor dramatic relative to the much more successful giant-bashing ""Pacific Rim"" feature of 2013, who has a superb mix of absurdity, pathos and general character formation that is vastly superior to Edwards effort."

","I am by far a very dedicated Godzilla fan. I own every film in the highest format available and have watched them all plenty of times.<br/><br/>I went into this movie excited, it looked RIGHT. The trailers were giving me a tone I could dig an I was interested to see what they did with it. Interestingly the trailer lured us all wrongfully on purpose which was fantastic! This interpretation of Godzilla goes back to an older way of looking at him, that of sort of an anti-hero. The concept is that instead of being created by the Atomic Bombs of Japan years ago, Godzilla is instead millions of years old and basically Earth's way of keeping the balance tipped away from other giant monsters (assumingly because back then, giant monsters ruined everything). In this sense, it's very reminiscent of the Showa Era of Godzilla. Which is where its weaknesses lie.<br/><br/>This film is just as slow, if not slower, than the Showa Era Godzilla films. There's a lot of (uninteresting) human character story, a lot of fight teasing, and just a very small amount of Godzilla until the final climax. Which would be fine except for two things. Firstly, the climax still doesn't give us enough giant monster fighting for my taste. Other Godzilla films, even if they have a heavy focus on the human element through the film, give us a climax of about a straight 10 minutes of nothing else happening except Godzilla kicking butt. This film STILL kept cutting back to the humans while everyone just wanted to see Godzilla vs. Muto.<br/><br/>Secondly, while it's VERY comparable to the Showa Era, that is my least favorite era of films.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though! It's still a GOOD Godzilla movie and all around a good movie. It's fun, funny, entertaining, at times jaw dropping and adrenaline pumping. It's well made and belongs right next to all of the Toho created films. As my title says, it's absolutely a good Godzilla movie. Without a doubt! I just would rank all of the other good Godzilla movies over it.<br/><br/>Definitely check it out and see if you may like it more than I do!"

Definitely much better than the '86 version which had Mathew Broderick in it.

","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Now I grew up watching the Godzilla TV show. I saw some of the B movies too! It was fun. I am ashamed to say it was not until adulthood that I learned from my older brother there was an original movie Godzilla the Japanese made in the 1950s. Well, low and behold the AFI theater in town showed the original with subtitles this spring and I saw it! I was surprised how serious it was and also how GOOD! I so enjoyed it. I really don't think I would have received all the punches of the new Godzilla movie if I had not seen the old one, I feel like almost a prerequisite. I was frantic the whole movie which I love being breathless! LOL! I only wish I had seen it at the theater!"
"tom924257","10","7","15","1 September 2014"," Haters should be ashamed of themselves
","We all know Godzilla right? An icon of Japan. so when Edwards make a movie that respects the legacy, people hate it because the wanted a terrible movie with tons o action instead of a great movie with a build-up and an amazing final battle.<br/><br/>Godzilla is supposed to be a dark and gritty film. People are to stupid to understand why Gareth went the route he did. he wanted to make people go on the edge of the seat through out the entire movie. I have been a fan of Godzilla back in 2004, and this movie proved to me that we can make a good Godzilla movie. Even TOHO, the very people who made the creature, loved the film.<br/><br/>But no, the only people that can't appreciate this film's glory are stupid kids and teens the need explosions and action every 2 minutes. It's sad that the world has been over run by childish annoying brats.<br/><br/>If you want a terrible movie with tons of action, go watch Transformers and leave an actual good movie alone."

He might not be in the movie as much but when he was he was awesome come on people stop hating and just like it because of the monsters. I mean come on Godzilla has atomic breath in the movie that scene is one of my favorites and also his roar wow so awesome in the cinemas.

","This was an excellent reintroduction of the Godzilla character, and an excellent movie in general. It was definitely a lot different compared to what I was expecting. That's for sure. But, in my opinion, the movie that we got (with Godzilla as the semi-heroic monster battling against the antagonistic M.U.T.O.'s) is preferable to the movie I had predicted (with an antagonistic Godzilla wrecking things all the way through the movie). This is my new favorite incarnation of Godzilla: a dark guardian protecting the balance of nature, no matter the cost. The special effects are fantastic. The acting is good. The story is great. I have been a Godzilla fan for years, and this is all that I could ask for from a Godzilla movie. I left the theater with a smile on my face, and I would definitely recommend watching this movie."
"Tyson14","10","7","15","1 August 2014"," The king is back
","The scene in Godzilla between Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binouche near the beginning is a powerful moment, and the sold-out, IMAX 3D audience I watched it with sat in stunned silence throughout it. We've been trained not to expect scenes like the one above in a summer blockbuster that features CGI monsters knocking each other out, and the audience reacted accordingly—I don't think many were expecting to be tearing up in a movie called GODZILLA. As the doors closed on Juliette Binoche someone behind me whispered ""Daaaaaang"", and that's when I knew director Gareth Edwards, arguably the next Steven Spielberg, had delivered with his sophomore film. His first film, Monsters, was an indie flick made for half a million dollars. That Legendary Studios and Warner Brothers believed in him enough to give him 160 million for this one says a lot.<br/><br/>It helps that Edwards clearly respects what came before: GODZILLA contains Jurassic Park references (a bus driver wipes the fog from his windshield to see Godzilla just like Malcolm does to see the Tyrannosaur), Jaws references (his spines cut through the water in extended shots just like the shark's fin; the BRODY family), Close Encounters of the Third Kind references (Cranston sneaks into a military site, nobody believes his wild theories); there's even a Mothra reference. What helps even more is that Edwards fills the film with talent: the aforementioned Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche give what could quite possibly be the best performances in a monster film ever; Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins plays scientists studying Godzilla; Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play a husband and wife torn apart by the monsters' destruction. It helps that every single one of these actors have been in acclaimed indie movies before, for none of them act like they're in a dumb summer movie. Instead, all treat the material like they were in a smaller, more personal film, an edict Edwards himself personally told Cranston and Binoche to follow. This elevates the film immensely, making the film more about the Brody family then Godzilla himself. (Herself?)<br/><br/>When Godzilla does show up though, it's glorious. Complete with motion-capture effects by the brilliant Andy Serkis (who played Gollum in the LOTR trilogy and Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes) Godzilla lives and breathes like a real creature we empathize with, feel for. He's bigger and meaner than ever before, but at the same time the movie makes him our savior. He's only here to restore balance, and the film makes it a point to show that he's not out to directly cause harm to mankind. He causes a tsunami simply rising up out of Waikiki Beach, killing hundreds if not thousands in its wake, but it's only to fight off another monster: a winged M.U.T.O. (Massive Unidentified Terrestial Organism) currently wreaking havoc across Hawaii. Later on his spines shield a bus full of children from some stray missiles carelessly launched by a panicked Navy cruiser.<br/><br/>Though the trailers are a bit misleading—despite what they make you think, it's Taylor- Johnson who carries the film, not Cranston—Johnson carries the film superbly. Many reviews have criticized Johnson for being ""flat"" or ""unemotive""; it's simply not true. He's a soldier, he's trained to act that way—take it from someone who's not only worked at a Air Base for two years, but someone who's dated a girl leaving for the Air Force and is best friends with a current Army soldier. When Johnson is suited up and with gear, he acts exactly like a soldier should. He gets a couple nice scenes with his wife and son early on too, and there he doesn't act like a soldier, he acts like a husband and father. He laughs with his son. He tells stories with his wife. He emotes perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Even when the film does slow down a bit with several scenes of exposition, ""perfectly fine"" is still an able description of it. At it's best it's applause-worthy though, and my audience burst into applause several times at key moments. Those key moments are worthy of the biggest screen you can find; when Edwards finally cuts loose and lets the monsters rumble, nothing can prepare you for the amount of awe-inducing shots. Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey crafts some of the best wide shots I've ever seen before, Edwards and Editor Bob Ducsay keep the cuts to a minimum and give us several extended tracking shots of sheer mayhem, and Alexandre Desplat gives the film a booming, awesome score worthy of the King of Monsters. Akira Ifukube's classic Gojira theme is missing, but Desplat makes sure you never actually miss it. If there's anything to miss, it's Olsen herself—outside of some brief scenes running away from monsters, she's not given nearly as much to do as everyone else. At times it feels like her runtime was cut, but it's not detrimental to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Still, Godzilla is given plenty of screen time. Many have also complained that the titular creature merely cameos; those that complain must subscribe to the Michael Bay school of thought that explosions and action must carry on for hours on end. What Edwards has done here gives us a more thoughtful, slow-burn monster movie that builds to a fantastic climax, and it does pay off much better than any Transformers movie ever has. Think of it this way: in the original 1954 Godzilla, he only gets 17 minutes of screen time. Darth Vader is only in 12 minutes of ""A New Hope"". The Joker is only in 33 minutes of the 152 minute ""The Dark Knight"". Edward's Godzilla is only in about 20 minutes of the movie but like the above examples, it feels like a lot more.<br/><br/>At the end of the day the king is back and Gareth Edwards tried to make the film the best he could and succeeded .<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"gzilla1998","9","7","15","26 May 2014"," A Godzilla movie that puts brains before brawn.
","As a longtime Godzilla fan since five, I've been following the new American reboot of Godzilla ever since it was announced in 2009. I will say that some aspects of this film let me down a little, but overall, I was very satisfied with the film and highly praise director Gareth Edwards for his take on the King of the Monsters. This movie completely surpasses ""Godzilla"" 1998 in almost every way (which, for all purposes, shouldn't even be called ""Godzilla"" anymore) and is also quite comparable to the original 1954 Godzilla film that started the franchise, as it faithfully retells Godzilla's origins in modern times while still exercising similar themes felt in the classic films. I thought that the monster scenes were fantastic, and the visual effects that created them were equally beautiful. The characters were a little bland and plain, but were overall okay. This movie isn't your typical action flick where every other scene is boom-flashy-explosions. It makes you think a little more and challenges today's audiences to put down the Transformers DVDs and return to the standards that made monster movies classics. I compare the teasing of the monster action to Jaws and John Carpenter's The Thing, where, you don't get to see the title character all too much, but the presence of them is felt throughout, and when they do appear on screen, it's a sight to behold. I recommend this film for all monster fans, but for the common audience, you should be well aware of what this movie represents and the cultural icon of Godzilla before you decide to go see it, it may impact whether you like it or not."
"bdiablo151","3","7","15","18 May 2014"," Slow and boring
","I had high hopes for this Godzilla incarnation. While I didn't hate the Matthew Broderick version, I did see it as a cheesy disaster flick. This one is supposed to have more heart. It's terrible.<br/><br/>First off Brian Cranston is not in the movie for as long as the ad campaign would have you believe. The actual main character, Ford, is so vanilla a character and actor that I have trouble recalling what he looks like less than 2 hours after seeing the film, I doubt I could pick him out of a lineup.<br/><br/>The Monsters are excellently done, the have the feel of a man in a suit and realistic at the same time. Godzilla's design is a lot better than the last go, but it doesn't have the character that the old Toho suit did.<br/><br/>All in all, skip it, you can catch it on netflix."
"john-tman29","10","7","15","17 May 2014"," A worthy addition to the Godzilla series
","This movie was a fantastic Hollywood - and more importantly, Godzilla film. I will start off by addressing the human element. It's very weak and there were truly some eye-rolling moments. However, the film pulled me through to the many great scenes of chaos. Being a fan of Godzilla since I was a child, begging my mom to buy any of the poorly dubbed VHS tapes available, this movie truly delivered. <br/><br/>I won't disclose much, but the enemies Godzilla faces are a wonderful addition to the city-stomping family of villains. They get more airtime than the big G but this is usually typical of the series, the anticipation and build-up of the final showdown and it truly is epic. I feel those uninitiated to the genre will expect more of Godzilla but this is not a Transformers movie, which dole out action to the point of tedium.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but the characters are flat. Thankfully there's enough meat to this beast that it's entirely forgivable. The CGI is incredible, breathing life into these monsters. I did not feel the same disconnect that I do with other films that use CGI to the point of feeling like a cartoon. Kaiju fans and regular movie-goers get their money's worth here. Looking back on the horrible 1998 American ""Godzilla,"" and Toho's disappointing last entry of ""Final Wars,"" Godzilla makes a theater-rumbling comeback and delivers a welcome respite from the overly-saturated comic book hero movies. Hopefully this will pave the way for another film because it definitely revived the feelings I had as a kid watching these movies."
"dehunter456","9","7","15","16 May 2014"," Epic
","Ever since an American production of a Godzilla movie was announced in the 2000's, I was hyped. Though the first attempt in 1998 was pretty bad, the production showed some promise. From there to now, I've been slowly growing more excited for the movie. After seeing it, I have to say that I was very satisfied. <br/><br/>The story focuses more on the human characters rather than Godzilla himself, which I think is perfectly fine. Edwards develops them a lot like his other film, Monsters. Like Monsters, it works pretty well. Easily the best character in the movie is Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody, a mad scientist who is desperate to prove to everyone that the ""accident"" that killed his wife in the 1999 nuclear powerplant disaster was not an accident and was in fact, another monster. Cranston throws a ton of emotion, and we really feel for him. Aaron Taylor Johnson plays his son, Ford Brody, a stoic bomb defuser who is desperately trying to track down the monster. Even though I said he was stoic, it manages to work, as he goes through some hard events, and in order to get through them and do his job, swallowing his emotions would be the best bet to get through the situation. Ken Wantanabe is good as Serizawa and the rest of the characters are well acted.<br/><br/>But let's face it though, we came here to see the king himself, Godzilla. In my opinion, he does not disappoint at all. His CGI is great, his roar is awesome on the big screen (make sure to see it in IMAX), and he has all the powers of the Japanese Godzilla. (and by all of them, I mean all of them). He's slowly teased through out the movie, which is also great. It is certainly better than just giving him to you and have the whole hour be just him. As shown in the trailers, there are two other monsters in here. They both look really cool, and put up a decent fight against Godzilla. <br/><br/>The rest of the VFX are top notch. The sets look really nice, and the action is great. The cinematography shows a ton of human POV (sort of like Cloverfield, but with a steady camera), as well as some classic Kaiju film shots. The score is definitely big, but only a few tracks are memorable. The rest just seem meh. <br/><br/>Even with a few minor flaws, Godzilla will please a ton of Godzilla fans and can be just as well enjoyed by regular movie goers. I would recommend seeing it a few times on the big screen since you won't get the same feeling on a home TV."
"pinkled5","3","7","15","16 May 2014"," Bored From Beginning to End...Actually Bored!
","This movie failed to make me care about anything that was happening to the people or the monsters. I was actually bored the entire movie. It started during the opening sequence where the nuclear plant was malfunctioning. I suppose it was suppose to be emotional and suspenseful as the main character tried to save his wife, but for some reason the movie just didn't make me care. With the other main characters we get a 2-minute scene of dad coming home from active duty. The entire character development of the whole movie is based on that one 2-minute scene as if that's all we need to care about these people. It wasn't enough. And when you don't care about the people in the movie, you don't care about the movie. I have never been BORED while watching a disaster film, even if it was bad, but I was bored out of my mind on this one. I can't recommend it to anyone."

Total disappointment"
"JMT-Studios","9","8","18","15 May 2014"," The First Movie To Make My Jaw Drop In A Long Time
","This has become my favorite movie of the year so far. This is exactly how a monster movie should be. It was realistic, it was intense, it had my jaw on the floor for some scenes. <br/><br/>Let's start with the story. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife (Juliette Binoche) in a giant power plant earthquake but what the public doesn't know is that it wasn't an earthquake at all but a giant cave in where a giant monster known simply as a MUTO has hidden itself in a cocoon for 14 years since that day and is now being hidden away in a fake quarantine zone. Once the monster escapes it's left up to the only other thing big enough, Godzilla, to take it down. <br/><br/>Now I took into account that this is a giant monster movie and for a plot to be something pretty simple like that is perfectly okay with me simply for one reason, the execution of the story is done in a way that I feel as though this is how it would go down if there were giant monsters roaming earth. <br/><br/>Now the acting. Bryan Cranston just kills it in this role. In the scene where his wife died I believed he was truly sad. All around an amazing performance which makes it kind of heartbreaking since he's only in the movie for maybe 20-25 minutes and then just dies leaving us with the rest of the story to be told through his son, Aaron Taylor Johnson. I'll be honest I think I would've liked it better if Cranston had stayed alive and like helped back at the headquarters that was monitoring everything but that's just me. I say this because Aaron's character just feels a little one dimensional to me. Like he didn't have enough character. I cared more about seeing his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) stay alive than him and she's off somewhere hiding while he's risking his life trying to diffuse a bomb to save thousands of people. Elizabeth Olsen does a great job playing the wife in trouble and Ken Watanabe is great as always. <br/><br/>The CGI. I'm just going to run through this one fast because this is something I don't focus on a ton in movies but I was told how amazing the CGI in this was so I knew I'd have to focus on it for this and talk about it. The CGI for the monsters is just beyond incredible, Godzilla just looked all around great and I loved every moment that I got to see him and the MUTOs. Now as for the scenery I felt it was a little lacking, I don't know just when I see those buildings fall apart I had a harder time believing I was actually seeing buildings get destroyed. That's all I really have to say on CGI. <br/><br/>Now for our main man, The King Of Monsters himself. Godzilla. I had a few nitpicks in everything but this guy right here is the reason this movie got a full 10/10 from me. To describe him in one word, Epic. Just all around epic. His grand reveal sent chills down my spine and left my heart racing 10 minutes after the scene had ended. Every time that roar came out I just melted with pure nostalgia and love. This is exactly what I want Godzilla to be. He's not a ""hero"" he's not an ""enemy"" he's just an animal trying to take out things he feels threatened by. He didn't attack humans, only if they attacked him and even then it seemed like he didn't purposely try to hurt them. He seemed more scared than angry. I feel he doesn't attack humans simply because well... they're humans. They're no threat to him, they tried to drop nuclear bombs on him and he just walked it off. He fights the MUTOs because they're a threat to him. They want him dead and have the strength to back it up. The fight sequences between Godzilla and the MUTOs are something out of your childhood dreams. He throws these things around into buildings and the second you see his tail turn blue you just get this amazing feeling in your stomach because you know what's coming. ATOMIC BREATH!! Me and my friend saw Godzilla grab the larger MUTO's jaw and we said how we thought he was gonna break it's jaw and it was going to be awesome but what does he do? He freaking uses his laser breath and shoots it down the MUTO's throat until it's head falls off. My jaw was on the floor out of sheer amazement at this sight. <br/><br/>In conclusion Godzilla is a great movie with nice acting, good effects, and one bad ass monster. A definite must see for any Godzilla fan or fan of monster movies."

","'Godzilla' starts out in the year 1999. After a mysterious unfortunate accident, a nuclear power plant gets destroyed with hundreds of lives being lost. One being from scientist Joe Brody's (Bryan Cranston) wife. Fifteen years later, fresh off serving in the U.S. Navy, Joe's son, Ford Brody (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) must head to Japan to help his father, who is obsessed with unlocking the truth to the power plant disaster. With Joe and Ford being witnesses, the Monarch Research facility unknowingly awakens a threat to all humanity that only one force of nature can stop... GODZILLA<br/><br/>It has been a long, grueling ten years without Godzilla. After seeing this 2014 film directed by Gareth Edwards, I can say the wait was worth it. Edwards only directoral job came from the B-Movie 'Monsters' so you could say this is Edwards directoral debut. I must say, for his first 'real' film, Gareth Edwards did a fantastic job. Every aspect of this film was perfect and I would not want anyone else directing this film after seeing the way Edwards did.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great. Fresh off his role as Walter White in 'Breaking Bad', Bryan Cranston delivers an amazingly powerful performance. His on-screen presence is so mesmerizing and you want more each time. This is definitely Cranston's best movie performance. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job as well, you could hardly even tell this is the same actor from the Kick-Ass' series. Ken Watanabe does an incredible job in this film. Each and every line he speaks is so powerful and delivered with such knowledge, yet fear. I believe this is Watanabe's best performance to date and I believe that most his lines in this film will grow to be classic quotes. Edwards and writer, Max Borenstein did such an amazing job with creating these characters because you really feel for each and every one of them and when they speak you could really feel the terror, or the sorrow or whatever was being delivered from them.<br/><br/>This film is absolutely beautiful and so pleasing to the eye. This aspect of the film surprised me so much. The cinematography in this film is perfect. One thing Edwards made clear when directing this film was he wanted to make sure that this was a reality. He wanted to make audiences feel as if this was actually happening and was being documented. I think this was perfect and really brought a sense of terror and dread to the film, making for some really spectacular and memorable moments. For instance, when you get that first look at Godzilla; as the camera pans from grounds level of his massive feet, up to his head is so chilling and iconic. The visual effects in this movie were absolutely breathtaking.<br/><br/>That sense of wonder and amazement you got when seeing the dinosaurs in 'Jurassic Park' for the first time is the same way you will feel when getting that first glimpse of Godzilla. These visual effects are so incredibly realistic, you feel as if you are pitted in the same environment with these beasts. Honestly, this was the best aspect of this film and if you have ever seen 'Godzilla' films as a kid it will make you feel like a child again. I know that is how it made me feel. I would be very surprised and disappointed if this film does not get an Oscar nomination for visual effects. I can say with 100% honesty they are the best effects I have ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>The score in this film is great. The costume design is good, it serves its purpose. Makeup effects are pretty good. The editing is done great. The sound effects in this film are so strong and it is so well done. The screenplay is perfect. Writer Max Borenstein does a fantastic job and I would really hope he is coming back for the sequels. Every line in this film is perfect and I truly believe there are some classic quotes in this film.<br/><br/>Some people complained that Godzilla got too little screen time in this movie. But you have to think back to 'Jurassic Park'. A two hour film, and only a total of twenty minutes of dinosaurs were shown, why? To preserve the wonder and reality. If you were to just have a movie filled with dinosaurs, or Godzilla fighting there would be no amazement. Edwards did a perfect job with the screen time of Godzilla. Every time you see him he is a forced to be reckon with and there is nothing but awe when you see him. <br/><br/>I have seen this film a total of three times in theaters and the 'wow factor' never seems to go away. Every time you first get that glimpse of Godzilla you get chills. The iconic roar, the visual effects, the fight sequences it is all just so mind-blowing. I have so much faith in this franchise and I feel it has so much potential to be a huge success like the 'Jurassic Park', 'Star Wars' and 'Dark Knight' franchises. Just thinking of all the success and possibilities makes me so happy to know that kids of this generation and everyone can experience what I did growing up watching all the 'Godzilla films.<br/><br/>If you are a huge Godzilla fan you will be overjoyed by this film. Even if you are not a huge Godzilla fan, I think it will be pretty hard not to love this film. Every aspect of this film is perfect, but the cinematography and visual effects will take your breathe away. This is leagues above the 1998 American 'Godzilla' film and Gareth Edwards really did fantastic. This movie offers a lot of thrills, terror, triumph, as well as heart. 'Godzilla' receives a perfect 10/10 from me."

It should've been called ""The Brody's"" or ""Ford Looks Up Stupidly with his Mouth Half-Hung Open for Ninety Minutes While the Audience Texts and Moans Audibly with Boredom."" <br/><br/>This film is a serious disappointment, as I love the Godzilla series, King Kong, and Kaiju movies. Do you know who else loves all these wondrous repositories of imagination? The great Guillermo de Toro. Please, please do yourself a favour and go see the much superior and joyous ""Pacific Rim"" instead. Seriously, go and watch it. *There* is a movie that honours Godzilla, and handles the material properly: with love."

","Good grief....I'd like to start by saying how much a fail this is. I wanted to swear out loud throughout sitting through this rubbish and took a lot of control to make it to the end.<br/><br/>If I were to go through all the bad points of this film I'd develop RSI, so I'll stick to a fraction of the wrongness.<br/><br/>If you make a monster movie that has huge combatants, it sounds simple but as those involved know only too well, you have so little to work with and you have to work so hard to create a hook for the audience. Effectively, you're on a hiding to nothing because although the audience will undoubtedly have turned up for fight scenes, to keep them engaged in a fight scene without a personal aspect is so, so difficult.<br/><br/>In my view, the fight scenes are a big fail and resorting to the overly abused hacky Hollywood moves just shows how little thought went into this.<br/><br/>The trailers would have you believe that Cranston would have a starring role in this but nope he gets offed pretty quickly and you find yourself at the mercy at the furrowed browed, Kick-Ass dude. Now I don't know if it was a miscasting, poor scripting or bad acting but it is definitely two of the above as this guy just irritated. As for Cranston, it's as if he was used as a hook for the audience to show up on the back of Breaking Bad (pretty good). Ken Watanabe's character was like a bewildered eunuch, who's only purpose was to look fearful and say Gowzeewa, a tragic waste of two fine actors right there.<br/><br/>I may be going against the grain on this but the only good acting was contributed by Elizabeth Olsen, whose performance was the only convincing thing in this debacle, it's not a weakness to show how much you love your man, good men rely on that.<br/><br/>I'm getting irritated as I'm writing this so I'm going to wrap it up.<br/><br/>The visual flaws in this film were employed for unbelievably low-brow donkeys that anyone who's IQ is above room temperature will start to get annoyed with these pretty quickly. The fact that the monsters are only being attacked, throughout the film, by divisions of the moron army, who would rather get so close they can punch the monsters rather than hit them from a nice safe distance doesn't put the US forces, again, in a competent light.<br/><br/>Finally (believe there are more but I can't be bothered), the fact that nobody notices a massive stockpile of radioactive waste, along with only a few thousand tonnes of mountainside just go missing, which then adds to the final irritation of the fact that the mutos wrap their eggs around one nuke in a city scape rather than set their nest within the massive stockpile of nuclear material that they have just walked away from, is laughable. Obviously this is just so you can a have a building smashing finale but the entire run up to the final mediocrity alienates the audience so badly that the final fight seems to be a meh affair.<br/><br/>Now if you look around this review you will find a good number of highly positive reviews. Don't believe the hype, they are either fanboys or have something to do with the film, to whatever obscure extent.<br/><br/>This is dire, laughable fair which is simply not good enough....Not even close. I was half expecting a WWE suplex of an mma superman-punch because it wouldn't have detracted any more from the film. If I see those in the sequel I would like to be paid in cash, I don't accept cheques. If you'd like to employ me, I'm not cheap but I can be had.<br/><br/>Ta, ta."
"BlindThanatos","1","9","21","19 May 2014"," How are there good reviews for this movie?
","Here's the thing, giant monster / character movies always have an issue incorporating humans into the plot, some do it well, others not so much. Godzilla does a terrible job of this. Essentially the humans only cause problems for themselves and have little to no impact on the actually story. In fact, the plot of the movie would be immeasurably improved if you only watched the movie from Godzilla's perspective which would mean watching him move under the ocean for 95% of the 130 minute runtime of the film. The writing is terrible and many of the actors are underutilized, and although I can accept some disconnect between reality and a sci-fi movie, it's like the writers knew nothing about science.<br/><br/>::Spoiler Alert:: In case anyone doesn't know, an EMP or Electromagnetic Pulse, disrupts electrical equipment, not stopping them, in the small scale. At higher intensities what will happen is capacitors and electrical equipment will be damaged due to the large surge of electrical energy. Meaning if the lights go off, they will not come back on until the equipment is replaced that has been damaged, they will not just work again after a set period of time. Also it will cause damage or outright kill anyone within the affected area as well depending on the type of energy that creates it. Okay, sci-fi has pretty much taken EMP's and turned them into something they are not, it's propagating ignorance, but it's a movie it's fine. But why the hell would an ancient creature evolve to have an EMP pulse? What would be nature's justification for developing such a weapon as the movie states that it will only turn off all electricity in a set area for a little bit? If nature was so concerned about the giant creatures that humans have absolutely no method of hurting even with electricity, why didn't they evolve to have giant spikes and anti-atomic breath armor? Which brings me to my next point. Why doesn't Godzilla come out the gate with the atomic breath? Does it take days for the LEDs in his tail and spine to light up? I mean obviously there would be lights that come on from the tip of his tail to his head prior to being able to shoot fire from his mouth, by why doesn't he pre-charge them or something? Here he is fighting for mankind (I don't know why) and he starts by slapping them with his little T-Rex arms and unsuccessfully biting at them. Apparently he just wanted to tenderize them before burning them, taking a nap, and then returning to the sea until such a time that monsters rise up to threaten mankind again or something. I really don't know what Godzilla's motives where, Ken Watanabe kept claiming that he was some force of nature that balanced the scales by making sure he was the only monster which he explains by telling us that ""man doesn't understand nature"", but it seems pretty flimsy. The army is functionally inept. To me this is the most realistic thing in the movie. ""We need to draw out the monsters by setting off a small nuke, which they will be attracted to, and then kill them with a big nuke. So let's put those nukes on a train because we obviously have no planes as we keep flying them over the monsters until they use their magical EMP leg and disable the planes thus destroying them."" Of course the train then gets attacked and the little nuke gets ate, because you know, it was the most delicious nuke in the whole country as evident by ""Mothra"" being drawn right to it. ""Oh noes we lost our little nuke, better arm the big one on the coast of San Francisco and set it to 1 and ½ hours before we drive the boat to its destination."" Wait what? ""Oh noes the monsters stole our big nuke and are now using it as an incubator, and when it explodes it will kill untold millions of people! We need to send a team in to disarm it!"" Now this is clearly just giving the humans something to do. No one cares about the plot at this point they just want to see the stupid monsters fight as they have been teasing us with out of focus, corner shots of 2 second battles up to this point. AHHH okay I can't focus on this terrible movie anymore, this was obviously a money grab for the actors and the studio, like it if you want, or save the $15+ and skip this syfy monster iguana vs giant bee big budget piece of garbage."

","To all that wish to see this movie and are reading these reviews, please check the back end of them. At the front you'll find paid people giving great reviews and at the end you'll find honest people giving honest reviews.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow<br/><br/>To the movie: I don't think that in recent years I've seen a worse movie. I presume all the budget money was spent on CGI and getting the actors to agree to doing this stupid movie. Cranston, the only actor who seems to be eager to make his role look good is killed off after just 20 minutes. The rest of the cast is just wandering about with one expression on their faces. All characters are completely empty, no emotions and even when some come, they are cheesy and not authentic. There is literally no character development whatsoever. Most of what is happening is happening just for the heck of it. No logic, no sense, no nothing. No plot even. Godzilla herself (or himself) has painfully little screen time. On the other hand, the other creatures are there a lot. Godzilla actually acts here as the protector of all people, but the way it is done is just stupid. And they are boring as hell. They look unimaginative and they act accordingly. Camera-work is empty, music, although not bad is unimpressive, given the fact, that the movie has no atmosphere, no tension whatsoever. In most movies there are moments where you go: ""Ah come on, now that's a bit far fetched."" or ""Come on, that's stupid/illogical/unlikely/borderline stupid"" In this movie, These two, and other lines were constantly on mi mind.<br/><br/>End result: 1) If you want to go watch a monster movie just for the sheer fun of monster movies, go ahead. It's dumb, but there are monsters. And nice CGI.<br/><br/>2) If you want to go watch a movie, that's dark, atmospheric, tense and smart, run as far as you can from this, because this movie is as close to those characteristics, as I am to a hot sexy supermodel. Yes - worlds apart. Universes even. The trailer was a great lie. That scene jumping scene, is the only one, that bares any resemblance to atmosphere.<br/><br/>3) If you want to see a lot of army guys doing something, but really not that much, aside from prancing around and being there, go ahead. This is more about the army than it is about any monsters. <br/><br/>Oh and I forgot, the whole story about Godzilla, what it is, what the other monsters are and what they are doing is so utterly stupid, that I actually laughed out loud, when they said it. The only thing that beats it in sheer stupidity are the temporarily mutated neutrinos heating up the earths core in 2012.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving it a 1, is because there is no 0, otherwise I would give it. Simply said - if you value intelligence, quality and stuff that makes sense, there is only one thing I can say: Run Forrest, RUN!!!"

The special effects were OK, but the villainous MUTOs were comedic looking. <br/><br/>I'll say that Godzilla himself looked great, but again, he was only in it for 15 minutes. The huge battle at the end took place at night so you couldn't see all the detail.<br/><br/>I'm a die-hard Godzilla fan, but this was really disappointing.

"sommarfrost","3","12","31","14 May 2014"," Not as great as you think (if you are more of a critic).
","Just a short review. I didn't go into this thinking it would be awesome. Actually, I said ""I don't expect it to be good story-wise but look amazing"". Going out of the cinema I was so annoyed. Basically, the movie is so illogical the awesomeness of it doesn't save it. <br/><br/>Yes, it looks awesome. Freaking amazing. It sounds amazing. The story- great! However, there are so many stupid things in it that just ruins it for me. Helicopters in the desert that doesn't make the sand swirl as it should. People looking for the creature and not finding it until its like 20 meters in front of them. Dude, they are HUGE. The probably smell like f*ck. They probably make sounds when they devour a freaking submarine. Same with the monorail scene. Sound? Smell? Something? The helicopters doesn't see the creatures when soaring above them. No one seem to get impaired hearing (or being bother by the sound at all for that sake) when creatures scream within the same block. It takes them 14 minutes to drag a missile part (don't know the right name) from a deep as hell pit onto a boat a fair bit away. So little debris that fly around when a giant winged creature fly around in a city that is smashed. <br/><br/>Mind you, this is a fairly soon after disappointment post, but a film that has so many logic flaws can't earn the praise it's been given. But the praise regarding the cgi and the story, yes. That's well earned imo."

"toadtje","9","5","10","24 September 2014"," I liked it..
","Alright, I have been reading a lot of reviews for this one, and to be honest, I feel that a lot of people actually don't understand why movies like these are made. That is a shame, because Godzilla (2014) is on the top list of recent monster movies, only topped by the supreme Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>So, let's see for a bit about what this movie is about, shall we? The story revolves around two MUTOs (other huge monsters) which are born from radiation that mankind actually are responsible for, and when they hatch, wreaking havoc everywhere, nature sends it's policeman, meaning Godzilla, to clean up the mess. That is, boys and girls, in short what this movie is about.<br/><br/>It's 2 hours of pure camp fun, seeing three huge monsters battle it out. And, of course, we also have a large portion of the movie dedicated to all the humans who simply don't understand Godzilla's role in all this mayhem. <br/><br/>Is it an Oscar worthy movie? Not really, as its not a deep and profound movie at all. Is it fun? Indeed it is. And well worth 2 hours of your time, if destruction and mayhem is your forte. I liked it a lot, and have seen it a few times now. <br/><br/>The animations of this movie is simply breathtaking, the destruction is well detailed as well as the towering sizes of the monsters. Yes, there are glitches of course, because nobody can make a perfect movie (meaning one without mistakes). But who cares? Its FUN FUN FUN. Take it for what it is. Its ENTERTAINMENT people, pure and simple. If you don't like monster movies, don't see one. Its that easy. Stop trolling here...<br/><br/>One has to realize that movies like this is made for entertainment, and to keep us entertained for a few hours. And it does the job perfectly, like many other blockbusters. Stop being so serious and just lean back and enjoy. You might like it :)"
"kclipper","8","5","10","29 August 2014"," The mother of all monster movies gets a well-made modern remake
","The Japanese monster movie classic of all time ""Godzilla"" was impeccably famous for its man vs. nature theme and its exploitation of our fears of what this massive planet and its billion year old legacy may be hiding within its deepest, darkest confines. Now its about time that ground-breaking film was made with the latest in modern technology and cinematic brilliance, especially 15 years after that disappointing 1998 Mathew Broderick retelling. This is a much more technical and thought engaging action masterpiece filled with decent performances and visually stunning complexity that captures the senses and satisfies our fascination with calamity and destruction.<br/><br/>The story begins in year, 1999 as engineer, Joe Brady (perfectly played by ""Breaking Bad"" lead, Bryon Cranston) discovers an abnormal electro-magnetic pulse pattern that destroys the Japanese nuclear facility, Janjira, resulting in the death of his wife and his descent into obsession with the real reason behind the tragedy. 15 years later, son and now a military soldier, Ford (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) doubts his father's sanity as he tries to prove that something secretive is behind the nuclear fallout. The sh*t hits the fan so to speak when giant parasitic creatures that have been feeding off of the radiation and contained by the Janjira corporation eventually escape and wreck havoc on the city. Not only does the government and company know about the creatures, but they also have evidence that prehistoric monster ""god"" exists within the depths of the ocean. Scientist, Kenn Wantabee (who looks like he's in shock throughout the entire film) believes that ""Godzilla"" is the only driving force that can restore balance and save the world from man's mistakes, and now Ford must help defend the world while his child and wife Elizabeth Olsen (younger sister of the Olsen twins) battle for their very lives in a city that is under siege by humongous monsters.<br/><br/>This is an action film that works on so many levels. The performances, storytelling and overall visual effects are all juggled well by inspired director, Gareth Edwards. Many audience complaints include: the killing off of central character, Joe Brady early on in the film, a weak performance from Aaron-Taylor Johnson, and not enough screen-time for ""Godzilla"", but its inconsistencies are compensated with dark but stylish cinematography . The death of Cranston's character is essential to the plot, and the monster-mayhem shines through as Godzilla's wrath is felt throughout including the infamous death-ray breath scenes and a subsequent ending that is satisfying and full-filling. Its fun and entertaining on a large scale, and successful enough for studios to begin work on future sequels. Hopefully they live up to this lively masterpiece."
"neoandersson2","4","5","10","24 August 2014"," I was expecting something else
","So we all saw the trailer for Godzilla, personally I was very impressed. It looked dark, intriguing, mysterious and a movie worthy of continuing the Godzilla franchise.<br/><br/>I was mistaken. The characters where so boring and uninteresting that I didn't even bother to remember their names. I'm a big fan of Bryan Cranston, as most of us are, but he is only in this movie for 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/>The only thing I could repeat to myself while watching this movie was that they really wanted to make Pacific Rim 2 but decided they would rather screw with this franchise instead. Instead of having Godzilla attack the human civilization, he fights two giant bugs from Starship troopers. At one point there's even sad dramatic music being played in the background while he is having his ass kicked by insects in slow-motion as if the audience would be emotionally attached to this massive CGI-abomination.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with so many inconsistencies and plot-holes that it's ridiculous. I usually let that slip when it comes to these sort of CGI-blockbusters but in this case the movie just wasn't good enough so I couldn't stop pointing out all the stupid plot holes. <br/><br/>Don't see it."

","I was looking forward to the movie since the trailer looked very promising. Instead I had to try hard to stay awake and not fall asleep halfway through the film. No good acting with the exception from Bryan Cranston who dies after 20 minutes falling from a bridgeEven Wantanbe disappoints but does barely have a chance to make anything out of the part he is given in the movie. The other characters are plain boring and you don't develop any empathy towards them. ( At least I didn't).<br/><br/>Even though godzilla looks good you barely see him in the movie, just in a short fight at the end. He is not scary thought since given human characteristics and portrayed as caring for the lives of the humans and trying to protect them from 2 moths which looks like a copy of alien with starship troopers cockroaches. They are designed very uninspired and not scary at all with eyes which look like audi headlights<br/><br/>Adding a lot of illogical scenes to the mix rounds up the mediocre experience.<br/><br/>The best scenes of the movie are already summarized in the trailer, you can skip the rest"
"jeanlenysole-46-540975","Null","5","10","5 July 2014"," BIG disappointment...
","I would def not put 7.1 on this movie, but something more like a 6. I was very disappointed that the only strong actor of the movie (Bryan Cranston) gets killed so fast (knowing that he was mentioned as ""starring"" role but played only 30 min...) <br/><br/>I also think that the story around Ford Brody is completely unrealistic... at one moment he is soldier off duty, 10 minutes later he is giving orders to soldiers that are not even working in the same base camp. Same thing when Elle Brody is leaving her son (Sam) with a friend of her, to try to find her husband. Everybody knows that a mother would NEVER leave her child at a moment like this, and that definitely turned me off to see such a thing. <br/><br/>This movie is more about the people than the Godzilla itself, we barely see any fight (except the last one), and the bad guys look so much like the monster in Cloverfield. <br/><br/>The VFX of the movie are really beautiful, and the animation is great. No comments on this aspect of the movie."

I wanted to give it a 7.8 rather than an 8 because of one little incongruous aspect that they've added to Godzilla.<br/><br/>Let's start with the negatives: - You can get lost in the story, it will be confusing for a while but it tends to clear up. - Afore mentioned Godzilla incongruity<br/><br/>But otherwise, I loved the new story, the new way of looking at Godzilla. I loved the cinematography; making us see the fighting and the devastation taking place from the POV of the children in the bus, or the evacuees hiding in the subways.<br/><br/>The action, the surprises, the building up of a complex and interesting plot is phenomenal.

","When going in to see this film, you need to realize one thing: Godzilla is just one character of several in this film and he has a supporting role. If you realize this -- and thus that it's not a monster movie -- you will enjoy this film much more.<br/><br/>The key strengths of this film are that the cinematography is great (the halo jump especially). From the opening credits to the end, my eyes -- and ears -- were never bored. This does help make up for the decent story. It's not magical and various characters come and go faster than you will like, making the continuity a little annoying by constantly shifting your focus. But it isn't blatantly horrible like typical big budget monster films.<br/><br/>Because of this I gave the film an 8 (willing to watch it again, but don't feel the need to own it)."

","Gozilla is monster movie masterpiece. In the middle of all destruction is a valid story to tell. Monsters have feelings and that makes them more charismatic than average movie monster. You can feel sympathy for the huge monster. They have a story to tell in middle of all effect rumble and humanity's nothingness against natures forces is well told. Gozilla is shown as a hero whose destiny is to survive human kind. Aaron-Taylor Johnson is quite vacant as a human hero, but survives his role as a father and soldier quite well after all. 3D works, but it is quite vain because they don't use it more cinematic. Plain 3D landscape is not enough, that is why I drop one point from five to four. After all Gozilla is a great summer movie and even I enjoyed watch it.<br/><br/>http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/"
"coljam21","8","5","10","29 May 2014"," Godzilla is the Man!
","So they did the old bait and switch with this movie. The ONLY reason I went to watch this movie was because of Bryan Cranston. I think he is an awesome actor and I love his work. To my dismay he was only a part of the film for the first 20 minutes before his character was killed. OK SOB's you got me. The Olsen girl should never be put in front of a camera again. Why can't she do like her sisters and waste away quietly? She has zero screen presence and whatever acting lessons she took was probably in her sleep. What a horrible miscast. Johnson can't act to save his life but he is so hot. Can't wait to see him put on a pair of tights in the next avengers movie.<br/><br/>OK so besides that the movie was actually good. I liked the twist of making Godzilla the good guy. I also liked the mystery and suspense of not really showcasing Godzilla until the end of the film. Some scenes were just plain bizarre and out of place like Johnson and the Asian boy in the train and the camera focusing on the little girl before the tsunami. The kids could not act and just stared blankly at the camera, act therefore I felt no empathy or urge to protect them. Any who Godzilla was awesome and emerged the champion."

Cranston brings his all to the table with an emotionally driven performance and adds another notch to his improving list of admirable roles. It is also nice to see Elizabeth Olsen back on the screen where she belongs, as she is one of the characters that reminds the audience that the story is as much about humanity as it is about anything else. Which brings me to the King of Monsters himself and I only have one word for that: epic.

I thought also that big G had less time on the movie then the MUTO creatures who I thought posed no real threat to Japan or NY. There only objected was to procreate with no real origin, and powers?!?!?! EMP?! They could have done better then that or choose of monster(s) to face the obvious strong Godzilla. They stood no chance at all. As for Godzilla himself, look great to me except for what it look like he put on some extra weight..lol. it was funny.

"lee_eisenberg","8","5","10","24 May 2014"," nuclear proliferation has more than a few dangers
","Obviously it was going to be hard for any future version of ""Godzilla"" to be as bad as the infamous 1998 movie. Much of this new version's strength lies in its look at nuclear proliferation. The opening credits show the various and sundry tests that the US carried out in the Pacific - many of which resulted in birth defects among the Pacific Islanders - accompanied by credits made to look like censored documents. And then the incident with the nuclear power plant in Japan is a pretty clear reference to the Fukushima explosion and subsequent cover-up (such as a controversial State Secrets Act). Another thing that makes this version interesting is that the title character isn't just some giant lizard going around wreaking havoc, but in fact has to contend with another set of monsters.<br/><br/>I will say that the movie goes a little overboard on all the stomping and smashing, but the look at excessive reliance on technology makes up for that. If an electromagnetic pulse occurred and knocked out all the electricity in a certain radius, people would probably go nuts, with or without a monster to create more terror. I enjoyed the movie, and I hope that it spawns more debate about the safety of nuclear weapons."

","I saw this movie last week, i am completely satisfied. I never ever liked Godzilla because, i don't like monster film(unless Jurassic park part1). But this movie impressed me with its CG work. Even though i am not completely satisfied with the emotions they are trying convey. Because the war is between MUTO and military organization. But after the Godzilla started to fight with MUTO, we can feel the struggle. First time ever i prayed that the monster should not give up. The dark tone for the movie gives some other impression. The new look for the Godzilla is amazing. However, after the there is so many unanswered questions is there. Overall, it was good movie with some minor flaws.<br/><br/>worth a watch"

","An entertaining monsterfest well suited to the big screen. It doesn't focus to tightly on the monsters allowing for some real suspense to build between action scenes. Definitely not high drama or a rich story but that's not what monster movies are, this movie basically brings Godzilla versus Mothra back to the big screen, with lots of cgi, great sound and gripping visuals. For a proper rating of this movie it's IMDb from a single rating system to a 10x10 system for a score out of 100. Rating the various elements like sound, sfx, story, cinematography etc to provide much better ratings. All those lame idiots who rate 10 or 1 for what ever reasons just kill the current IMDb rating system. If you after a visual and sound monster fest experience go and enjoy."
"keyos27","2","5","10","21 May 2014"," Poor Godzilla
","Writing a negative review requires a wide range of perspectives and careful observations in order to avoid misunderstandings of an individual opinion as well as biases. This time, I have come straight here without going through a rough draft to let all of you know that one of the highly anticipated monster movies of the year has bummed me out. <br/><br/>1. The scientific explanations of reactors and the military strategies that include undersized troops towards Godzilla and winged creatures are all over the place as they are poorly edited and scripted along with repetitive helicopter scenes. The music is not in sync too.<br/><br/>2. There are hardly any connections in terms of emotions and character developments other than the Joe and Sandra's separation scene. Due to the disheveled editing and the mediocre acting, not only is it hard to feel sympathies from main characters, but roles of a few characters also seem redundant. That is the main reason why Godzilla get constantly overshadowed for the first half of the film.<br/><br/>3. The last but not least, the battle scenes. Despite experiencing a few dynamic shots of the well-modeled Godzilla with detailed textures that is vividly and realistically crafted by high-end software, it is still disappointing as I am not able to fully enjoy its gigantic presence. The fighting scenes aren't continuous, intense, and long enough due to the poor editing and excessive narration as well as bad camera angles that fail to capture everything that Godzilla has to show. <br/><br/>Obviously, the movie is supposed to be about the origin of Godzilla so I should not expect an array of intense actions and explosions, but other than Godzilla's breathtaking flamethrower, the trailer gives you everything you need to see without making you bored. I was really expecting to be in awe and hear some applause from the audience, but instead I am flustered by woe after hearing yawning and cackling."

","It was a powerful monster movie. The monster fights were truly amazing placed after the patient teasing buildups. But we didn't get to see the amazing entire Godzilla much. It shows up only in the end of the movie. Rest of the time we see his legs or tail or face. and many times his back while swimming in the ocean, which looks like floating mountains. The MUTOs were really brutal. But I wonder why were they walking in the city when they are able to fly. And why the male MUTO travels around just to hand over the female a nuclear missile. In the end Godzilla just goes in to the ocean and swims away, which I think was weird. During the whole movie I was thinking MUTO is this powerful. They aren't able to fight with him. How will they save themselves from Godzilla. But the end was unpredictable."
"TiredCamel","2","5","10","20 May 2014"," A Godzilla sized turd
","I've never really understood the point of Godzilla movies. It's just such a dumb idea. A giant monster lizard thing that lives in the sea and fights other monsters and is somehow a warning about nuclear weapons? Right. I guess a 9 year old might be interested, but even when I was 9 I couldn't see the point.<br/><br/>Anyway I went to this because of some good reviews and I had a couple of hours to kill.<br/><br/>Well the film is a giant Godzilla sized turd.<br/><br/>Here's what you need to know:<br/><br/>1. Script is appalling. What is wrong with Hollywood scriptwriters? The writers should be ashamed of themselves. The film is full of almost every clichéd line and trope you can think of: ""mommy mommy I love you"", ""there are civilians on the bridge!"", ""daddy don't die!"". <br/><br/>2. Acting is beyond bad. These actors are paid millions to ponce about in front of the cameras for a few hours once or twice a year while the rest of us have to work our asses off. So you'd expect these overpaid professionals might actually do some acting, but no, they don't. The lead guy is totally forgettable. The usual silent tough guy who has to save his family. I was rooting for Godzilla to sit on him.<br/><br/>3. As usual it is America that is being attacked because in these kinds of films, America Is The Most Important Country in the World and the rest of the world can go to hell but we gotta save South Central LA or wherever.<br/><br/>4. The parasite things are lifted straight from Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>5. I'm not sure if anyone said at one point ""ok people let's do this"", or ""lock and load people"", but they probably did.<br/><br/>6. There is no tension at all. Zero. Mainly because I had no interest in any of the characters. The only character I cared about was the dog running from the Tsunami. God I hope that dog made it. <br/><br/>7. They hot wire a boat. Seriously.<br/><br/>8. There's a scene with kids on a school bus stuck on a bridge. Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>9. There's a scene where they use music from the film 2001. It's just pretentious, and this film is definitely not 2001.<br/><br/>10. The hero saves the day single handedly as usual, although unfortunately not by defusing the bomb with only 1 second left, or by clipping the red wire (or is it the blue one?!) while drops of sweat trickle down his macho brow.<br/><br/>For a while now I've felt that Hollywood has run out of ideas. This film confirms that."

A scene opens with Cranstan from the neck up in a body bag. With no time to further develop his character, or any farewell good bye. Just zip, he gone. <br/><br/>Godzilla makes his dramatic drawn out entrance and he emerges from the ocean. Woah he's awesome. Two ripoffs of pacific rim monsters gang up on godzilla. He then takes a power nap. Wakes up and defeats both of them via tail whip and fire breathe. Again, this was awesome. Then he collapses yet AGAIN. Talk about over kill of his character. He gets to his feet, makes an extended roar of dominance to reign supreme among all mega monsters while simultaneously assuming the role of the hero, and then quietly makes his exit into the depths of the ocean and vanishes from sight. A great touch. But the time lapse of these events, even with Godzilla drawn out eccentrics, is about 20 minutes tops. In a 2 1/2 hour movie.<br/><br/>The CGI is top notch. The flow, plot and story is slapped together like a sloppy kindergarten cut and paste project."
"EmmaDinkins","8","5","10","19 May 2014"," A Chix Chat On Film Review: Monster for the ages
","Godzilla has been around longer than I have, so I've had the opportunity to see his many incarnations over the years starting with the 1956 King of The Monsters starring Raymond Burr, which I saw many years after it premiered but found it extremely memorable. The trailer for this monster reboot immediately wet my curiosity. The story was obviously going to be done with finesse there seemed to be an air of mystery, and was being told as if it were a serious drama. I've realized that when fictional tales are told with a dramatic flair making the tone more realistic the more serious I take them. Case and point, there was a campiness to the last Godzilla that added to my distaste for it, not to mention his lizard-like appearance, then came this latest offering and I am filled with the same excitement for Godzilla as I remember having as a child. There were some questionable actions and scenes by some of the characters such as Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) having encounter after encounter with skyscraper sized monsters and narrowly escaping with his life just too many times to be believable. The monsters however were absolutely believable, and I have made no secret of the fact that I have a great appreciation for first rate the special effects and in this case they were very worthwhile to watch. I also appreciated the scientific explanation for Godzilla's existence and feeding habits as detailed by Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). I have to say that I am now looking forward to expansion of the series, with an updated Mothra, Rodan, MechaGodzilla any other combatant for Godzilla and anywhere else the film makers want to take us in the monsterverse. On another note, yes I look for 'Us' in every film, so it was nice to have Captain Russell Hampton (Richard T. Jones) on the job in command and defending the world from the carnage."

When you look back at what Godzilla has always been about, you will realize how successful this admittedly flawed movie really is. ""It was all about the other monsters at first!"" Yeah, a lot of Godzilla movies are like that. Otherwise who is he gonna fight? It's pathetic how many people there are complaining about things like Godzilla's firebreath being blue. It's always been blue, and it's not firebreath. If you don't know who Godzilla is, or what a Godzilla movie should be, of course your hopes will be let down by this movie.

","*contains spoilers*<br/><br/>I wanted to like the movie as I had been looking forward to it for several weeks.<br/><br/>First off the CGI is impressive, fantastic Godzilla and MUTO monsters, 10 out of 10 for the monsters!<br/><br/>However, the pace of the movie was too slow and the beginning of the movie really could be cut out without impact<br/><br/>The character development simply did not work and failed leaving me with no connection to them what so ever. The only character with a little depth was Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe)<br/><br/>The movie was structured to focus on the characters rather than the monsters, but because the character development was so poor it completely failed; for example when Godzilla and the MUTO started to fight the movie switched several times to one of the characters either watching the monsters on television or a similar scenario. Actually, this was a really clever idea but it failed because I just didn't care about the one dimensional characters and was begging for the movie to switch back to the monster fight scenes.....which didn't happen<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the Admiral, David Strathairn is a fine actor , but I was really beginning to think he didn't realise he was in the Godzilla movie.....no passion, not tension, no suspense, no frustration from the character he played<br/><br/>The person sitting next to me in the Cinema started using his Iphone, half way through the move, normally I would ask the person to switch it off, but I felt the same ....bored<br/><br/>What is it about Godzilla movies? The movie back in 1998 failed as the casting was terrible but at least it tried to create characters and tried to build excitement and suspense.

Very similar to the Transformer movies whether it be Megan Fox or Rosie Huntington, just make the movie seem amateur in acting and are only there for eye candy (maybe that's an actual intention, but still).

Aaaand it was pretty good! It played it safe and kinda shows, but that was good for the formula they had.<br/><br/>-The story was a good update of one of the originals (and I won't tell you guys which one) and I really liked the new looks. I also loved how much they honored the original in the look of the monster, characters, story, and movie overall.<br/><br/>-Its 2 hours and has an origin story pace. I did wish Godzilla was in it a little more earlier on, but the Pacific Rim good fights at the end proved worthwhile.<br/><br/>-The cast was good. Bryan Cranston was great! Ken Watanabe is also one of my favorite actors now! He was so good in it! Yup. I did not really like the lead that much. I don't know his name and his character is not supposed to be all actor, but he still could have used a little range.<br/><br/>-Music was great! Exciting and honored the originals a lot! -Cg was great. Could potentially be an Oscar contender. Also fights rocked.<br/><br/>-Cinematography and look was pretty good too! I was impressed a few times.<br/><br/>-So overall it was infinitely better than the first American attempt/failure in 1998! It was on par with Godzilla as a remake and I enjoyed it. It was not as ""cool"" as Pacific Rim, but it was deeper and had an actual story. Lol.<br/><br/>-I would give Godzilla a high 7.5. Almost an 8. I liked it more than my 7,5s so far (Amazing Spider-Man 2, Muppets Most Wanted, Non-Stop) but not as much as my 8s (Jack Ryan, Lone Survivor, Saving Mr. Banks, God's Not Dead) I want to give it an 8, but I would not buy it.<br/><br/>-I would however totally recommend it! Content was very mild and it was an awesome monster movie! So if that's your thing then I would totally recommend it! Also stay tuned for X-Men next week!"
"MaximumMadness","8","5","10","15 May 2014"," While not without some flaws, 2014's ""Godzilla"" is ferocious monster-sized entertainment that's a ton of fun! It should easily please fans of the character.
","I am definitely what you could call a fan of the ""Godzilla"" franchise. Maybe not a hardcore fanboy... but definitely a fan who has seen most of the films at least once, and has an informed-enough opinion to be able to point out my favorite characters, creatures and entries in the series. (Side-note, my favorite entry is probably a tie between ""Destroy All Monsters"" and ""Godzilla VS Mothra"", strictly for their strong entertainment value.)<br/><br/>I'm also able to recognize that the King of Monsters has a bit of a dark past when it comes to American productions. Specifically... the 1998 Roland Emmerich film, which bared so little resemblance to classic ""Godzilla"", it was actually more-or-less parodied later in the film ""Godzilla: Final Wars.""<br/><br/>So I went into this new film with mixed feelings. On one hand, the trailers and early buzz had me excited. But on the other hand, the last American outing left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, and had me worried. (Although I will admit, I don't think the '98 film was absolutely atrocious... on its own, it was just a mediocre creature film, but the fact it was called ""Godzilla"" really took it down a few pegs, because... well... it just wasn't ""Godzilla."")<br/><br/>Thankfully, my hopes were met and even exceeded, and I emerged very satisfied from the theater. Because director Gareth Edwards' new reboot is absolutely entertaining, ferocious, sometimes emotional... and is pure, unfiltered ""Godzilla"" fun.<br/><br/>The film predominately follows Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), a soldier who is pulled into a great conflict after he and his emotionally-scarred father (played brilliantly by an under- utilized Bryan Cranston) witness the birth of a creature referred to as ""MUTO."" (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"") While Brody attempts to help the military contain and destroy MUTO (while trying to stop the birth of a second, potentially more dangerous MUTO creature), another threat emerges from the depths of the world- the enormous reptilian creature known as ""Godzilla"", who has arrived to presumably follow an instinctual urge to hunt the MUTO creatures and destroy them.<br/><br/>The cast is quite decent. Taylor-Johnson is a serviceable protagonist, although he comes across as a bit of a ""Mary Sue"" at times, which does make him boring in a few key scenes. Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody is a revelation, though. (Even though his role isn't quite as developed as we may hope.) Torn apart by the loss of his wife in a tragic accident, Joe is determined and dark, and gives the film a lot of depth early on. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's wife Elle, is a great addition to the cast. She pulls her weight and is able to give a nice sense of drama as she is caught-up in the chaos of the dueling monsters. And Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa, a man with knowledge of the creatures and what is happening, is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>But the human characters aren't really what most people are going to be looking forward to. No, we were all looking forward to seeing Godzilla and the other creatures, and boy, this this film deliver!<br/><br/>Godzilla is almost always brilliantly portrayed on-screen. His new, updated design is fantastic, serving as not only a tribute to the iconic classic look, but also something a little new and a little different. (Though don't worry, he's still clearly Godzilla... he's just been brought into the 21st century in a big way, with some slight design changes that actually make him feel more real than ever before.) The effects work that brings him to life is extraordinary, and even though he's essentially just an animal, the film does a good job at making him seem like a true ""character""... you can sense what is going through his head through his body language and some great subtle facial expressions. Brilliant job on the big guy. The MUTO are also a lot of fun. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say their design is quite cool, and they do seem to pose a genuine threat to the world and to our anti-hero Godzilla.<br/><br/>Edwards direction is top notch. I hadn't seen his first film (the wonderful ""monsters"") before seeing this, but here, he's able to present the film in a grand way, from the basic scenes of character development to the giant melee brawls between Godzilla and the MUTO. The script is tight and well-pace. The music is perfect, and emphasizes what we see on-screen. Set and costume design is top-notch. Overall, this is a fantastic production.<br/><br/>However, this film isn't without some flaws. The biggest issue is that, well... Godzilla doesn't appear on screen all too much. Which felt funny for a film called ""Godzilla."" The film really seems to relish in its build-up to his repeated reveals, and it can get grating after a while. Although when he's finally allowed to shine, it almost completely makes up for how much the film previously teased us. I also felt that Taylor-Johnson's lead character wasn't quite as compelling as I might have hoped, causing a lot of the scenes between the human characters to be a little on the flat side.<br/><br/>But I can easily forgive those issues, because when this film works... it REALLY works.<br/><br/>This is pure ""Godzilla"" fun. It's a blast to watch him back on the big- screen, and it's a great relief to see him done justice in an American film finally. This film got me hyped enough that I am already crossing my fingers for sequels.<br/><br/>I'm giving 2014's ""Godzilla"" a very good 8 out of 10. While flawed at times, the payoff is just too good to pass up."
"edzelr","8","5","10","15 May 2014"," The Godzilla movie done right.
","After 10 years of disappearance from the big screen, the king of all monsters is back and this time it's a far far better one than the much maligned 1998 version. Though the movie has its flaws, I think Bryan Cranston should have taken the lead role. His character was the only one that stood out the rest and was very well-written and developed, Good thing the build up to the big lizard's resurgence was there to overshadow the cardboard characters. But seriously folks, I paid to see Godzilla come back and like all its movies that came before, the human characters were mere reactors and commentators of the behemoth's presence. I liked how the big lizard was re-introduced to this generation, it wasn't rebooted and it wasn't very expository. For those who complained that the lizard lacked screen time, I believe in the old saying ""Less is more."" In closing, this Godzilla film serves as an antidote to all movies today especially in a time where I have become somewhat fatigued of the comic book and action genre that has clocked around 2 hours and 30 minutes only to highlight collateral damage."

I can't finely pinpoint but somewhere in the rain (again) and behind the Vegas take down there is some sort of snore factor that takes precedent. I enjoy a destruction film but when a filmmaker becomes too preoccupied with the pretentious ideal that the film in question is somehow more than a destruction film, then there is so much human drama fodder to sift through in order to get to the good stuff. The flip side – the good stuff is truly awesome and relentless without skipping on annihilating as much as possible. <br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't care about the main characters and their lives? Maybe I just didn't care about anyone's existence if it meant that the destruction would have to cease? Maybe I am just annoyed that Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston seem to set the precedent of how great the performance in this movie is going to be but then it turns out that they're the best thing that isn't a special effect? <br/><br/>Did Aaron Taylor-Johnson worry about how hot he looked constantly? Yes. He was ripped. The end. Did Elizabeth Olsen get to flex anything other than her sob skills? No. She cried so much. She cried probably just as much as Ken Watanabe stares, into the distance, at screens, out windows, he stares so much. <br/><br/>But the title is Godzilla and as far as the title is concerned, the film delivers. Godzilla is definitely well worth it. The humongous, roaring, destructive anti-hero with rocky-leathery skin and the somehow illusive existence is fun to watch. The build up was well timed. And the action was nicely paced so the viewer could soak it all up.<br/><br/>The story - Basically there are two new mutant creatures out to destroy all in order to procreate and destroy even more.

"BradleyPlausse","7","6","13","5 August 2014"," Better then everyone said
","Godzilla<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer to this movie I thought ""This is Bryan Cranston's obligatory summer blockbuster following the success of a TV show role."" (Ex. Dominic West in 300, Deirdre Lovejoy in Step Up, Kiefer Sutherland in Phone Booth, Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness, Martin Freeman in The Hobbit) But, to my surprise, once I started watching the movie I realized that he was cast for a good reason, and not just to sell tickets. I thought he did a great job playing a man who is desperate for answers without looking too much like Hiesenburg. (Maybe it's the hair) And that's all I'm going to say about Mr. Cranston. He's not the main focus of the movie so neither is this review. The first two acts of the movie are satisfying. They were more suspense then action, but it worked well. The opening twenty minutes do a great job of establishing conflict and getting us to care about the characters, but they feel under-developed. I don't even remember the main character's name. None of the characters have an arch, but what do you expect from a summer blockbuster about a monster. David Strathairn's character felt displeasingly similar to his role in the Bourne movies. Overall, the acting was believable except for the unnecessary child. Fortunately, the kid wasn't involved that often, so it wasn't a major issue. Godzilla is shown sparingly and that's a good thing. This movie would have gotten really boring if they just presented Godzilla right off the bat instead of leaving an element of mystery to the monster. It was this choice that made the third act good. Not great; but good. The plane jumping scene was awesome but I felt like it was ruined in the trailer. I did like how they used the same music from the trailer. It helped capture the danger and uncertainty of the situation. I thought the monster fights were great, but the same couldn't be said for the parts with just humans in them. Their was one scene that involved gasoline (people who watched the movie know what I'm talking about) that made no sense and left me feeling frustrated. I thought that the cable news parts were annoying and were clearly just used for exposition. The CGI was impressive and there were only three times were it took me out of the story, but all three of them were during quiet moments so I didn't mind too much. My biggest complaint is the way the movie dragged on. I felt like if the last five minutes were cut out, and the end was left to interpretation, then the movie would be that much better. However, Godzilla was still a satisfying film. It was everything I thought it would be plus a little more, and it was able to sustain legitimate tension throughout the second act. I anticipated giving this film a 6/10 but this movie was a little better then I expected. I'm giving Godzilla a 7/10. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an entertaining summer action movie without superheroes."

","Short version of this movie: Godzilla fights two other monsters trying to lay eggs. Humans get in the way. That's it.<br/><br/>The two hours this film takes up is mind-numbing. The bulk of the movie is meaningless scenes filling space between a few monster fights. And I mean meaningless. For example: the lead character has no stakes or motivation for an hour into the movie. This finally changes when monster #1 heads toward San Francisco where his wife and child live, and even that is weak when the city could just be evacuated.<br/><br/>Verdict: avoid and maybe try a $1 rental when Godzilla exits the theaters."

","It must've been a big gamble for the latest ""please forgive us for Godzilla 1998"" project to be handed to a director whose previous film was a hilariously low budget indie monster flick, then give him the budget of a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster and tell him ""yo dawg, go make Godzilla."" It didn't work.<br/><br/>I admire what Gareth Edwards is trying to do, provide a suspense thriller that give you the big payoff at the end instead of doing what Pacific Rim did last summer, but this. movie. doesn't. work. It's just boring, the only two interesting characters get basically no screen time, and the main character played by Taylor Johnson is so bland, dull and blank you could've recast him halfway through the movie or killed him and no one would've noticed. The big Godzilaa fight at the end is awesome, but it is not worth sitting through so much boring story, bad characters and stupid, insulting set-pieces to get to, skip it."
"tristanwiggill80","9","6","13","6 June 2014"," A film of Epic proportions...
","Godzilla is one of those movies that you don't measure on an ordinary scale, it can only be measured on a Grand scale! The trailer presents such excitement and intrigue (as many trailers do) but what makes Godzilla great is that it meets the expectations of what is advertised. The performances were fantastic especially that of Bryan Cranston and Kick Ass Actor Aaron Taylor Johnson, but what really makes this a great film is the mystery of Godzilla slowly revealed until his first appearance later on in the film. Though I heard many complain about Godzilla's late appearance into the film, I found that this only made the story better and more intriguing. Have you ever been told that somebody has a surprise for you and your imagination makes up the most exciting ideas, that is how I felt while not seeing Godzilla. Instead the viewer is put into the position of the victims who experience the quakes and the destruction which makes the story more suspenseful and frightening, and by the time we see the creature for the first time we experience what the characters experience: The immense threat that Godzilla poses. This is definitely one of 2014's strongest films. Godzilla is an Epic Movie!!!"

","I am a major fan of old monster movies and let me tell you, Godzilla is the greatest monster movie I have ever experienced in cinema. I'm 21 years old and I lost everything I considered my cool whilst watching this movie in IMAX. If you have any doubts, cast them aside and go see it now! You'll not experience The King of Monsters in his prime on a TV or computer screen. <br/><br/>Even though I'm a hardcore fan of Godzilla, this movie really presents the classic monster movie into a modern epic. The 1998 Godzilla doesn't even compare to this movie, and the guys really worked to create a superb film.<br/><br/>Well worth the money and I stand strongly by my title for this review."
"Vinegaroon3","2","6","13","23 May 2014"," Godzilla doesn't work....on any level.
","I just saw this movie with a friend. I wasn't expecting too much, since I rarely like CGI-extravaganza type films. Even having said that, I left this movie disappointed and angry. It was really bad, and if I was alone I would have walked out long before it was over.<br/><br/>I do not understand the art of cinema sufficiently to explain exactly why the movie was so bad. If I was tasked to make a ""spectacle"" film about two large monsters fighting, I don't think I could do any better. But then again I am not in the business...<br/><br/>To summarize, the film was a disjointed mess. Characters are introduced, then fade in and out of the action without any development or real purpose. I could point out dozens of plot holes and logic flaws in the way the film progressed, but that would be giving the movie too much credit. It would imply that if some disbelief was suspended the movie would have been ""OK"", and it wouldn't. Even the CGI was hokey in many places. The Godzilla creature was shaped and proportioned exactly like a man in a Godzilla suit. This fact was actually sort of humorous. Back when these movies were first made, when Godzilla WAS a man in a suit, I can see that as a necessary concession to budget and production. But since I know the 2014 Godzilla was 100% CGI, why not abandon that compromise? To put it bluntly, I thought even for those few moments that Godzilla appeared, he looked silly.<br/><br/>The movie is completely without any suspense, and it is plainly obvious early on how it is going to end...not conclude...just end...stop.<br/><br/>Enough said I guess. Ignore the 7+ IMDb rating (how?) and skip this one. An honest rating would be 2 or 3. I don't believe it merits a ""1""...just because I think it is a difficult story to make a decent film out of. Maybe they simply should have skipped re-making ""Godzilla"" altogether and instead come up with something original? Another ""Spiderman"" remake perhaps?"
"bradgstclair","4","6","13","18 May 2014"," Godzilla - a monstrous disappointment
","I am not sure what I was expecting with Godzilla, but the 120 minutes I experienced was not what I had in mind. Maybe it was the pretty decent reviews that seemed to be floating around that got my hopes up, or maybe it was the amazing trailer (it was probably the trailer). Unfortunately, the hype got the better of me, as after walking out of the cinema all I felt was disappointment. The 2014 Godzilla is not a great movie, in fact, it's not even good.<br/><br/>I guess I was so impressed by last year's Pacific Rim (I'm being serious – not tongue in cheek), that I really thought Hollywood had the 'big monster causing destruction' thing all worked out. As it turns out – they don't. What made Pacific Rim so fantastic was that the writers knew the premise behind the film was ridiculous, and accordingly, they made no attempt to hide what the audience was there to see – being destruction. They kept the story simple and didn't take themselves too seriously. In contrast, the writers of Godzilla failed to grasp the ridiculous concept at the center of their film, and instead tried to make a moody, brooding, serious Godzilla film. <br/><br/>So the story - Bryan Cranston (Joe) is the lead engineer of a nuclear power station in Japan. Something 'mysterious' causes an explosion. Cut 15 years forward and past some sappy back story about Joe's son (Ford) and Joe is still in Japan, trying to uncover what caused the explosion. As it turns out, it was a MUTO (yes – a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that the Japanese had been growing in a weakly fortified pit since the accident. Unpredictably, it escapes.<br/><br/>As it turns out, after 15 years of hibernation, the MUTO is simply looking for some action, and another MUTO appears, with the two of them obviously having planned years earlier to meet for their sneaky rendezvous in downtown San Fran. It is now, about half way through the movie that Godzilla gets to make an appearance, but by this time the thrill is already starting to wear thin. There have already been two big monster reveals (the first and the second MUTO) and there have already been plenty of scenes of destruction (Japan, Hawaii and Las Vegas). But – third time lucky. Godzilla friend or foe of humanity – that is the question. The scientist who let the MUTO escape from the most pathetically secured cell on earth thinks friend, the US military – keen to use some nukes for the first time since WW2 – think foe. So there is Godzilla (pretty much a fat, slow, swimming T-Rex), and the two MUTOs, and the 2 nukes – and they are all converging on San Francisco.<br/><br/>Queue scenes of escaping and running people, the bridge getting wrecked (surprise!), the usual ""monster moving slowly and people not moving as they hope the monster suffers from the 'T-Rex can't see still people' thing from Jurassic Park"", and all the other general scenes of chaos and destruction that seem to be copy and pasted from these movies year on end. It's not this sort of stuff that irked me though, it is the rubbish side stories that get thrown into the mix. Rescuing kids, calling wife on phone, walking a train track - its all very unnecessary. <br/><br/>Thrown in the last 20 minutes of the movie is what the fans are really there to see, and that is a face-off between Godzilla and the two MUTOs. Is Godzilla here to destroy humanity, or is he here to restore balance to the globe and be the big scaly superhero we never knew we wanted? It panned our predictably – and I was uninspired. For a start the director decided to set almost all of the action sequences in the dead of night. It might be great for atmosphere, but when there is a 50 story lizard on the screen I want to be able to see it in the full brightness of day, not dramatically hidden by smoke and night. The whole time I just wanted to turn on the lights and experience a good old day time fist fight. Secondly, Godzilla really wasn't all that impressive a monster. He lumbered slowly and pretty much got his ass kicked for most of the fight sequences, until he remembered at an all too convenient time he had the power to shoot blue fire from his mouth! Again, I feel like Pacific Rim got in a year earlier, and two stars better, as the battle sequences really felt clumsily put together. To top it off, Godzilla finishes with one of the most laughable movie endings I have ever seen. Truly awful.<br/><br/>In short, Godzilla tried to do too much. The first hour was full of too much pointless back story. The whole thing was full of too many pointless locations and changes of place / time (there were seriously about 30 subtitled location / time / destination changes throughout the film). The first half was full of two too many pointless monsters, and the last half featured far too little of the one monster you actually wanted to see. There was too much darkness, too much bad acting and too little Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>It will probably not be a long wait before the next Godzilla movie – sequels are all too easy to come by these days and the end of the film leaves that window entirely open. I just hope it strips back the story and focuses on what audiences want to see. In the meantime, I might go watch Pacific Rim again."
"shweetbox","2","6","13","17 May 2014"," Terrible Film
","Marginally better than the 1998 remake. This movie is marred by HORRIBLE dialogue (and way too much of it) as well as terrible acting. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is excellent but dies way too early, leaving us with sub-par acting and a horrible story. <br/><br/>While my expectations were low for this film it seemed to be even worse than I imagined because the film had potential yet is was squandered on terrible actors and even worse writing. <br/><br/>Best performances of the film:<br/><br/>1. Bryan Cranston 2. Godzilla (a CGI character in a live action movie). 3. That cute lab running in the streets of SF (a dog). 4. The credits rolling (signifying the end of the abuse). <br/><br/>This flick should have been trimmed to at least 90 minutes."
"e481719","4","6","13","17 May 2014"," Total disappointment
","I never watched a movie with more inconsistencies before.<br/><br/>First of all, movie is completely different from what trailers of the movie displayed. Biggest example is, it is not a movie about Godzilla, it is about MUTO. Secondly, you may think from the trailers, Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston) is the main character, but movie says ""f.ck you"" to you and kills him right at the start and leaves you with his son, who is a completely boring and pointless character. And most importantly, trailers show a dark, ""survival fight of mankind"" story focused on military. But no. I don't even know what it is instead.<br/><br/>I am gonna try to list the inconsistencies i mentioned:<br/><br/>EMP. A constant reason to say ""bullshit"" repeatedly during the movie. Is it a pulse, occurs when MUTO desires and fries electronics or a constant effect, stays on, as long as MUTO alive? You can never know. Electronic devices work as long as story needs them, even at the times it is clear that EMP effect is on. Half of the devices work and other half do not work at the same time. Range of EMP is sometimes large enough to effect satellites but sometimes small enough to let planes fly over it. <br/><br/>Radiation. Does MUTO's absorb it from the environment or they need to eat its resource? How do they ""sense"" the locations of the radiation resources? Does all nuclear arsenal of the U.S. military and nuclear reactors of Japan and submarine fleet of Russia leaking radiation constantly?<br/><br/>Origin stories. I am skipping Godzilla's origin story because there is none. Seriously, none. For MUTO's: Two ""eggs"" are found under a mine, okay. One of them cracked and male one, a huge creature bursts from ground and creates a huge trench by just by walking is not noticed by anyone. It swims hundreds of kilometers and digs under a nuclear power plant and again, not noticed by anyone including Japan radars, sonars whatever. Second egg is dissected(as we told), examined and stored to a (apparently deserted) nuclear waste storage(good call). It is, apparently still alive after dissection and examination, gets bigger and bigger in the storage over the years and bursts from the reinforced underground facility. And again not noticed by anyone until it is too late.<br/><br/>Every single military and government action. Firstly, there is a complete failure of communication at all levels. Complete failure of evacuation and/or sheltering. Nobody has no idea where the female MUTO stored and they check every single room. Military has no idea about the EMP properties of the creatures, just like the viewers. In one scene soldier says, ""no airplanes, only land transportation"", in other scene fighter jets and helicopters sent directly to the monsters. Military sprays random missiles and shells to the civilians. They make a plan to use nuclear bombs as a bait but they have no idea about which route to take and will it lure monsters on the way. They have no idea where is the creatures at any given time. They drop paratroopers from a plane(how? no idea) with ""snipers"" for the top of the buildings. What are they gonna ""snipe""? Soldiers decide to carry huge nuclear bomb to shore, instead of trying to open one damaged, flimsy cover to defuse the bomb.<br/><br/>Why MUTO's try to meet in the city, hoping to find some radioactive food on the way, instead of the nuclear waste storage, that female MUTO was in? Isn't it the perfect home for their young?<br/><br/>And one more thing, if i were the guy who makes that cinema sins videos on youtube, i would have give this movie a sin for the every f.cking single flashlight seen in the movie.<br/><br/>Before watching the movie i told one of friends ""Existence of Bryan Cranston is a automatic +3 for the movie in my book."" I am keeping my word in spite of his death and giving this movie a 4.<br/><br/>Sorry for the every grammar mistake. This is first review i write and the longest English text i have ever write in my life. English is hard."
"danielsmith-1","4","6","13","17 May 2014"," Broken and Bad
","OK, firstly the disclaimer that I'm a reasonable chap that likes films of all genres and degrees of quality, I have no grudges against the genre, the director or anyone of a number of other spurious reasons that people could use against me.<br/><br/>So, that out of the way, on with my review which I'm guessing you'll have already realised is unlikely to be particularly positive. <br/><br/>There are two main reasons I went to see this film:<br/><br/>1 - The reviews. Literally every review I have read in the popular press and online media has been overwhelmingly positive.<br/><br/>2 - Bryan Cranston - Huge huge fan of Breaking Bad, love Bryan Cranston as an actor and feel he brings depth to any moment he spends on screen.<br/><br/>I'll address these two points separately and will do my utmost not to let point 2 bleed too much into point one although the absence of point 2 certainly contributes to my distrust of point 1. <br/><br/>Yes, I get the fact that it's far far better than the Roland Emmerich version. That was a piece of Hollywood dirge of the highest order, churned out around the same time period as Independence day and a whole load of other 90's/turn of the century disaster/monster/alien invasion/end of the world type of movies, most of which seemed to feature Jeff Goldblum playing exactly the same character in each one. But just because it's better doesn't mean it's a great film. Certainly not the 10/10 rating film that overwhelmingly seems to be cropping up in reviews.<br/><br/>If I was to do my best to boil it down to a few short points the problems are as follows: 1 - The dialogue 2 - The acting 3 - The pacing 4 - Minimal Godzilla 5 - Convincing but dull CGI 6 - The characters 7 - Too much military stuff 8 - Point 2 which I'll get onto in a minute<br/><br/>The dialogue is so lacking in soul and humour, every interaction between the characters is like pulling teeth. But less interesting The acting is so lacking in soul and humour, every interaction between the characters is like watching people acting badly The pacing is all over the place - just when it starts getting interesting they spend several minutes focusing on some pointless bit of dialogue between two badly acted characters Godzilla is in it for about 5 minutes. Slightly less than Bryan Cranston (yes, I'll be detailing that particular issue in a moment, wait for it) The characters are so ill developed it's as if they've been imagined by a 3 year old ""the happy woman spoke to the sad man and the boy. The boy is sad as well but gets happy when he sees his daddy"" There's so much macho patriotic American military nonsense in this film it almost made me long to watch Independence day again for a respite. <br/><br/>And, then onto point 2.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston dies in the first half an hour of the film. This is not only terrible because he's billed as the main star, it's terrible because he is the best actor by a hundred million miles, terrible because as soon as he dies the film just does not recover. At all. And terrible because of the realisation that the promoters of this movie have so cynically utilised the obvious draw of having Bryan Cranston in the movie purely to pull in all the Breaking Bad fans.<br/><br/>I know I'm a victim and yes I do feel foolish but I would have probably accepted it if, say he'd been in it for the same amount of time but spread out over the course of the film. They could have quite easily kept his character in there, providing a bit of Jeff Goldblum style scientific opinion, but no, 30 mins or so into the film he is killed off in the most uninspiring manner possible and suddenly, you realise, no more Cranston. What momentum had been built up to that point was immediately shattered.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot fathom why there are so many great reviews of this film on here and indeed in the press. Do you people have eyes? Are those eyes having their visual signals interpreted by a rational and functional brain? Have Warner Brothers paid you all an enormous sum of money to write the equivalent of Linkedin recommendations for a film that you clearly realise is a steaming Godzilla sized turd?<br/><br/>I'm already having disagreements with friends of mine over this film and I'm sure many of you on here will disagree with me but, honestly, I cannot remember a film that has brought me so close to walking out before. <br/><br/>But the CGI wasn't bad.<br/><br/>So we'll end on a positive"

The trailer looked gorgeous and Gareth Edwards ('Monsters') and Bryan Cranston ('Breaking Bad') seemed to be a perfect team for this - sort of - remake. To be honest, the first 20 minutes of this movie aren't bad at all... Bryan Cranston really delivers the hell out of his stereotypical character and Juliette Binoche gives a splendid (but short) performance. But... and this is a huge but... after a pretty decent start the movie loses everything that made it quite cool: Bryan Cranston!! What the hell is wrong with the people who made this movie? There are huge plot holes and weird inconsistencies! <br/><br/>The Mutos looked really dumb (not a huge improvement to the original creation played by an actor in a costume) and have double the screen time compared to the movie title hero Godzilla. What? Why is this movie called ""Godzilla""?! <br/><br/>Godzilla himself is one of the most dull-witted characters I have ever seen! Throughout the whole movie you do not feel any sympathy for him or care for this stupid huge and fat monster! Come on, the remake of King Kong was pretty great!! There were emotions, feelings and a much more believable monster than this piece of sh*t! <br/><br/>The plot holes or 'dumb decisions made by the protagonists' are unbearable. Oh okay, lets kill a huge monster that eats atomic waste with... an atomic bomb... congratulations, a smart decision! Or, come on, why would you send your child away when you know that your city is attacked by huge monsters out of hell?? <br/><br/>And the worst: this movie takes itself too serious!! I mean, there are huge monsters fighting each other like in a stupid Wwe Smack Down. Even Hulk Hogan fights look more realistic than this! Not a single person in this movie ever smiles! There are no jokes, nothing! Guys, this is not the 'Color Purple', this is a monster movie! Even Emmerichs 'Godzilla' (1998) was far better than this one. Back then, the filmmakers knew it was rubbish and the audience knew it, too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy this huge monster B-movie! <br/><br/>Save your money, wait for a movie that is worth watching or watch it at home when the DVD comes out.

Also, like for Pacific Rim, the combat scenes of the monsters are always at night.......WHYYY???? Was it to difficult to have them in day light? CGI to expensive otherwise? Well, the could have spared on cast and writers, because the plot is written by drunk apes and the justification for the existence of those monster is far beyond stupidity. And, as said, it is the festival of clichés, from the Golden Gate, to the army general that NEVER, in any movie, follows the suggestions of the scientist, because he knows better. Screenwriters need to start at a new method for inducing drama and conflict in movies, because they cannot keep milking the same old cow ""because it works on morons"", because even them are starting to see behind the illusion of the same, abused, pattern of movie scripting. And I write with cognition, since I myself have read books and followed lessons about screen writing. It cannot be always Hollywood VS the rest of the world, when it comes to movie production, we are no longer at war, we do not need to be brainwashed into American lifestyle, we already are. You do it to much, and we start to realize it, and worst, we start to make jokes about Hollywood movies and its clichés, almost as much as Bollywood with their funny dances and recurring love dramas.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about going and see this movie do yourself a favor and think twice.

","First off, Crapzilla was in the movie for 10 minutes. So much the the title Godzilla. The only cool special effect was maybe the intense fire breathing that looked like an acetylene blowtorch which helped killed these ridiculous giant bat insect like creatures. Where did these creatures come from who knows. There was absolutely no plot development. Cranston gets killed off in the first 1/2 hour. Why couldn't the director have kept Cranston on throughout the movie as one of the people helping to search out and destroy Godzilla. No instead his son is designated to do the task. Bad plot choice. There is a scene where the guys are laying on a bridge and godzilla is about 20 feet away. So instead of just laying low what do they do, shine a flashlight into godzilla's eyes. Brilliant. That will keep the monster at bay. Then they show them shooting a gun at these creatures like a few bullets from a regular gun will make a difference. The movie had no plot what so ever. The CGI creatures were ridiculous. It reminded me of men in giant bat costumes. At least they could have had a godzilla that menaced the population eating people and maybe trampling over cars. None of that. They had this dopey Asian doctor or scientist who looked like he didn't have a clue as to what to do. They had many scenes of people who were close to the monsters just looking up with empty stares. They didn't even seem scared. It was hard to watch. Truthfully if I hadn't paid 16 wasted bucks to see it in IMAX I would have actually walked out thats how bad the movie is. Take your 16.00 and get yourself a nice meal. You will regret it if you waste your money on this movie that truthfully is just full of hot godzilla breath air."
"boi-coon","3","8","19","16 May 2014"," Godzilla Was a Let Down
","I was looking forward to this movie ever since the teaser trailer came out. There were about 200 people in the cinema and I was pumped. Unfortunately if you thought this movie was about Godzilla fighting another monster then you were mistaken, instead its a movie about nothing... just some soldier and his family doing stuff while you wait for the monsters to fight.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong i love a good story, something that makes you think and pulls on your heart strings but Godzilla doesn't do that. They explain everything about the plot through dialogue. They tell tell you about Godzilla's origins and about their plans to stop the monsters. I found it hard to care about any of the characters, Bryan Cranston dies so suddenly that when they told Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) about it, I thought they were lying to him. The only reason your supposed to care about his wife and son is because they are his wife and son, his son only has like three lines in the whole film. You actually care more about the little Japanese boy on the train than you do his own son. I'm guessing your supposed to like Godzilla at the end but I don't see why. You have to wait an hour till you properly see him then another 30 minutes till he does anything. And then he still destroys half the city. At the end they called him the savior of the city, he doesn't care about the city, he just wanted to kill the other monsters who were there because of some nuclear warhead.<br/><br/>The pacing was terrible, I was actually checking my phone to see how long we were waiting for Godzilla to appear and I wasn't the only one. When he finally does show his fat ass, your pumped and ready for a fight, then... nothing happens. You just see a T.V which tells you what happened. Then they almost fight two more times but don't. Then when they finally do its in the middle of the night and you cant see them, and all they do is wrestle. Then Godzilla shoots a lazer out of his mouth which does nothing, but then later on kills the other monster. Like i said there were about 200 people and no one made a sound. There were no oohs, no aahs, just silence. People were just sitting there while the movie happened.<br/><br/>People are saying how great the CGI was in this movie but CGI doesn't make a Godzilla movie, Godzilla does. All i wanted was Godzilla, but i only got half an hour of him, and an hour and a half of crap. So sorry about this rant, but that's just how I feel.<br/><br/>Maybe we will have a good Godzilla movie in another 16 years."

"stephenwilletts68","1","7","16","22 May 2014"," Complete waste of money
","I think 1 star for this film is more than it deserves. I'd been wanting to watch this movie for a while now, and I managed to go last night. I was bored after the first few minutes, because nothing really happens. Oh you see buildings destroyed and people are killed, but the suspense is so dull, their was no feeling whatsoever.<br/><br/>Why Godzilla can't be seen in the opening sequence I'll never know. In the beginning of the film, man see's his wife get killed because it looks like an earthquake. Nothing to say anything different! Yet for some dumb reason, 15 years later he knows it wasn't a quake it was a cover up. Really? The only prove he has is....wait a minute he has no prove because he never saw anything to say otherwise. OK maybe we can forgive them for this dull opening sequence, maybe the rest of the film gets better and better. If you think that then you are very much mistaken. For the next 60 minutes or so nothing happens and I mean nothing whatsoever. It's just some dull acting and people looking like they have constipation. After a long dull first hour we finally get to see the monster...hang on, scratch that comment...because the monster we see is actually a radioactive eating flying bug. Yep you got it a 'bug'. A bug for some reason has been a round for millions of years and been living radiation. (Can you see the big mistake?) Its not for at least another 20 minutes before we get to see who we've all paid to go and see...Godzilla himself. Sadly though we only see his dull spikes on the back of him. When he finally does appear, it turns out he's coming to the rescue and kill this giant 'fly' and wait for it...the flies none flying mate to stop them from having more uninteresting bug babies. Eventually at long last Godzilla catches bug number 1 and I have to admit the Japanese beast gives a terrific raw. Eventually we are going to be treated to at least a decent fight between the 2 creatures. Er..no! Soon as 'ol 'Zilla raws, they cut the scene to boring humans, doing boring uninteresting stuff that has nothing whatsoever with the rest of the plot. After nearly an hour and fifty minutes we the creatures start to fight. At this point I was so bored, I got up and left the film.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a dull uninteresting monster movie. They mocked the 1998 version. It might not have been brilliant, but at least we saw plenty of the beast smashing stuff up. In this version Godzilla is here to defend the world. What a complete waste of money and time watching it.<br/><br/>My advice, don't bother"
"jayenjr","4","7","16","21 May 2014"," Should have been better...for a monster movie
","Sorry, but this Godzilla was a letdown in terms of expectations. Sure, the monsters looked great, and Godzilla itself was looking like the real deal, compared to the 1998 dud; but it's a MONSTER movie, not Terms of Endearment. It's supposed to be summer slam-bang entertainment, not one of those Oscar seeking type. The preview hype made me expect something along the lines of the first Transformers' movie - brawn AND brains. When it should have had more throat grabbing monster fights, Godzilla ended up being given less screen time appearance than some of the actors. One moment he appears, and you adrenalin goes up expecting a big pow-wow; next, the scene cuts to Elizabeth Olsen's character- not the kind of letdowns you want in a summer movie! And the acting - other than Cranston & Binoche, everyone else was wooden - including the great David Strathairn and the usually dependable Ken Watanabe. Look closely, and you'll find unreal expressions from the likes of Sally Hawkins. Aaron-Taylor gives an almost perpetual blur look for the duration of the movie. The Plot too- weak. Sections of the script seems to borrow from a typical Syfy channel do - why is it always down to one scientist who discovers the 'plot'? What are the guys at NASA or the UN doing? And why is it nobody believes that scientist until everything goes kaboom? You think with a budget of some $160m, they'll at least try to bring the script up to date in this age of the internet, but no. I'm giving it a 5 and not a 3 or a 4,only cos of Cranston's short but effective appearance, and cos of Godzilla's monster-awesome looks. Otherwise, this is a biggest letdown since The Dark Knight Returns."

","When you go to a cinema and expect to see movie in which Godzilla destroys city or two and you have no expectations for story or acting and you still leave disappointed then you can tell that movie is a complete failure. Acting... I saw none. Someone actually paid them for that 'performance'? Characters are not even one-dimensional. Mannequin dolls with subtitles below will do same job in terms of characterization. No connection to any of them during whole movie. And that Japanese scientist guy is by far worst. Story... so full of gaps and inconsistencies. I do not expect much of a story from a monster movie but this is just insulting. Effects... at least this part of the film crew did they job well. There are few exceptionally well made scenes that will put chills in your bones. Unfortunately between those scenes is still this exceptionally boring movie."

","If you are a fan of good old fashioned Godzilla, then you will love this one.<br/><br/>Considering that the movie is, primarily, CGI, you don't even notice it. The realism is off the charts. The acting is sub-par, but it reminded me of the old school Japanese versions that were dubbed over. I think it spent just a little too much time with the back stories and not enough on the main story, but the action sequences made you forget all that.<br/><br/>This was the first Godzilla I have seen that had blatant deaths in it, (people getting eaten.), although there was no blood and zero harsh language. There is only 1 'Jump' scare. I went to see it with my 8 year old who loved it. There were a few moments where he stood and cheered.<br/><br/>This movie is for all ages, if you remember seeing these movies at the drive-in or if you are old enough to spell Godzilla. It is a great movie. I give it 9/10, but I am a old fan of these movies. I am so glad this one didn't cheese."
"JohnnyPHreak","9","7","16","16 May 2014"," Modern but classic telling of the king of monsters
","I grew up with films. As long as I can remember I've loved movies. I hold many real near and dear. The most that happen that way are films that take me back to the time when I was a child. There was no stress, no responsibility, no adulthood. I could be taken to a different time and place seeing things that only dreams are made of. Godzilla was one of the first monster movies I ever saw. I fell head over heels for this giant city destroying creature of prehistoric origins. Along with him and Frankenstein they were alone. It fit me well being the only child in my family. I would sit as close to the television as I could gawking in amazement at these motion pictures that which displayed visions of the mind.<br/><br/>Monster movies meld all different types of genres which I enjoy. I don't like being stuck in one box. I want a piece of me in all the boxes. That way I can take the best piece of each and mold them into something astounding. There's drama, metal and physical, action, adventure, science fiction and at times horror. This new version of Godzilla, brought to the world by still newcomer Gareth Edwards feels old. Not saying that it's a bad thing. It's far from that. I felt after seeing the film I had just watched a classic tale. But there was nothing classic about this other than the story telling. <br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward in that humans trying to rid the world of something in fact create something so threatening that the only way to rid it of this is let a ""God"" deal with it. But the story isn't told from the point of view of the monsters. It is told from the views a family lead by Joe (Bryan Cranston) an American engineer working in Japan. He lives there with his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) and their son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). An accident happens in the past which sets up for the future. Most of the movie takes places 15 years after this first accident where humans are still trying to understand and test what caused this horrific accident. Scientists Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins lead the research which causes absolute chaos.<br/><br/>I have read that many people are upset that most of the film is very human oriented. Well, it has to be. You don't get sucked in if most of the movie is just monsters battling each other. Although very cool, there has to be a human element to drive the story leading to the action. Yes, I'm probably taking a shot at Transformers, which I love but for different reasons. Cranston is great but he's not on screen for long enough. I would have loved to see more of his character. Taylor- Johnson is the lead. He does hold his own as strong willed soldier but at times he's a bit stone faced and bland. Watanabe and Hawkins make the most with the screen time they do have. I do like their interactions it's very master/apprentice. Elizabeth Olsen portrays Taylor-Johnson's wife who really doesn't have too much to do other being a women in distress hoping her family will make it out of this earth shattering event. <br/><br/>For the first moment of the film, which I think this was a nice nod to Jurassic Park, I was sucked in. It's doesn't overstay it's welcome. This is more of a slow burn building up the suspense, the drama and action culminating in a payoff that is so worth the price of admission. The whole story is played very much as a classic monster movie. I just loved it that way. There are times when these new tent pole action films get caught up with shoving the action just down our throats. Maybe I want to be wined and dined first. There are only glimpses of Godzilla before his big reveal. Both of which make you scream at the screen but get the anxiousness in the body boiling. His look, his sound, everything about him when he is on screen is just...awesome. This movie did it all for me. I was a five year old kid watching an epic film unveil itself in front of my eyes. For those film nerds there are plenty of nods to the film's long history. The only thing I have left is the king of monster is backofficially."

","If you're a classic Godzilla fan, this is the best Godzilla film to date. Give the build up a chance, Godzilla is not your every day character/monster/hero. He is a Mythical Creature, a Legend, a God of sorts... that comes to fruition and delivers. That's what this is. Godzilla doesn't require much screen time to make a statement. Harsh critics are expecting too much, and it's that kind of thinking that leads to an over exposed sequel. <br/><br/>So to those that find Godzilla too fat, and find him lacking screen time, let me recommend the (1998) Ronald Emmerich reincarnation of Godzilla. <br/><br/>Some reviews have stated that the structure, pace and delivery of the story is similar to that of The Dark Knight, however, I found this story to resemble the structure of Batman Begins. The story-line is strong, doing a great job of building up the character of a creature we can barely imagine in our minds. Gareth Edwards then takes our expectations and delivers with visually epic and scaled scenes that represent the enormity of the central figure (Godzilla). <br/><br/>There really isn't much more to say, this is a Godzilla film that intends to go down as a Classic and rightfully, it will."
"BloodStone","9","7","16","16 May 2014"," Saw the New Godzilla Film last night and...
","it kicked ass! A H-U-G-E improvement over the 1998 Tri-Star bastardization(I know, that's not saying a whole helluva lot but still..). A very intelligent, plausible approach that wasn't insulting to your intelligence & stayed faithful to Godzilla's true origins. The film had Lots of drama & excitement plus a few surprises. There's also a new nemesis for the big guy that can only be described as a cross between the monster from Cloverfield & Gaos (from the 90's Gamera films). Can't really go into too much detail without possibly spoiling it for others.<br/><br/>Positives: Good story arc (kind of reminded me a little of the plot from ""Gamera Guardian of the Universe""). Great performances from Bryan Cranston & the guy who played Dr. Serizawa etc.. Good (not great)monster action. The tsunami & various other scenes of chaos & destruction are awesome.<br/><br/>Negatives: Godzilla is all CGI & that might take some getting use to especially for those traditionalists like myself who grew up with the suitmation approach. Godzilla is thicker in the body & neck & his roar is slightly different. Don't worry though, his atomic breath remains intact but is not over-used. The other negative might be that they went a little long on the human drama. It also would've been a nice touch that as the credits rolled at the end they would've used Ishiro Honda's original Godzilla theme music.<br/><br/>Overall: A definite see for fans of the Big G. 8/9 out of 10"
"griffolyon12","9","7","16","16 May 2014"," Godzilla is King
","If you have been hankering for a good giant monster movie, then Godzilla definitely fits the bill. The King of the Monsters returns in true heroic fashion in this American-made reboot, that makes the last American-made attempt in 1998 look like a joke.<br/><br/>In this Godzilla, when a new monster, named MUTO, starts to wreak havoc across the Pacific, he eventually draws the attention of Godzilla, leaving the humans to try and find a way to save humanity before we're all destroyed. There is a lot more to the story than that, but that is the basic gist of this movie. There are giant, radioactive monsters upsetting the balance of nature, and Godzilla must perform his sacred duties to restore that balance. As a matter of fact, that's one of my favorite things about this new Godzilla, is that they make him the hero of the story, by painting this idea that the reason for Godzilla's existence is to maintain the delicate balance of nature.<br/><br/>Cutting straight to the point, the monsters are the stars of this movie. Like all Godzilla movies, the human characters are merely there for exposition and to create an emotional avatar for the audience to experience all the insanity through. Even still, there are some top notch talent creating that anchor, from small, yet crucial performances by Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche, to a nice Everyman turn by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins as scientists who are the source of all exposition. While I feel the filmmakers could have pushed the human characters a little bit further, all in all, the human characters always work to create empathy when they're on screen, and isn't that their purpose when the world is being destroyed around them?<br/><br/>Truthfully, the real takeaway from this film, for me, is director Gareth Edwards. With just two feature films to his credit now, he has quickly become one of the directors to watch. Edwards' work here is nothing short of phenomenal. All of the action is represented from the perspective of the human characters, with cutaways to the monsters bashing one another rarely not seen, but rather experienced via destruction and how it is affecting the human characters on the ground. As well, Edwards has quite possibly the most important skill a director needs, which is a great sense of place. The way he shoots these action scenes, and any scene for that matter, gives you a great feel for the space in which each scene takes place in. You are rarely lost or confused when watching the chaos unfold in this film, and that's a credit to a meticulous craftsman.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Godzilla is everything you could want from a Godzilla movie. While I feel the characters could have been pushed a little further towards a third dimension, they are relatable and perform their duty at setting up the epic battle at the end between Godzilla and not one, but two MUTOs. I especially loved the conspiracy theory angle that permeates the first half of the film, creating an air of eerie suspense that I really dug, as well, the musical score by Alexandre Desplat is very different than any of his other work, often harking back to the great John Williams' scores of past. Simply put, Godzilla is a great Summer blockbuster, and is the first one of Summer 2014 that is actually worth seeing.<br/><br/>I give Godzilla a 9 out of 10!"

","Godzooks....Just saw Godzilla: Any movie that kills off it's most interesting characters in the first 20 minutes is doomed from there on out. OK so you have big scary monsters laying waste to cities. Monsters that not only make us look puny but surprisingly don't just wipe us out for our shear stupidity. Don't read this part if you don't want to hear a major plot point. Here goes. These creatures (yes there are more than one) feed on radio active material, so what is our plan to destroy them?.... That's right send in a nuke to distract them and then blow them up. I won't tell you how that goes. It is amazing that these creatures feed on radiation and yet no-one dies of radiation poisoning, well unless you count Juliette Binoch. The movie pays homage to, or capitalizes on, however you want to look at it, every major disaster we have had in the past 10-15 years. Tsunami's, buildings crumbling, Floods (i.e. Katrina) and, of course, nuclear breakdowns. At least the old Godzilla movies knew they were camp, this one takes itself way too seriously when all it really is is a B monster movie with cool special effects. If that is enough for you, then have at it, but if you want something where you really care about the characters, I would steer away from Godzilla, although Godzilla himself proved to be a real mensch in the end."
"timo-hellmund","9","7","16","16 May 2014"," The King of all Monsters is back.
","In advance: I am one of the people who think Emmerichs movie was very bad.<br/><br/>When the first trailer was revealed, we (2) monster movie and Godzilla fans had no doubt this will be the most important film for us in 2014. This is one of the very few films which do live up to their hype - and even surpass it in some scenes.<br/><br/>Everyone worrying about the new Godzilla, can calm down and watch this film. It let's you forget about what Emmerich did to Godzilla 16 years ago.<br/><br/>The cast is great and I would say even better than in many of the Toho originals. Every actor transports the size and drama of the circumstances and events in a very believable way. Bryan Cranston plays his part with such a power and presence, you can only love his character. Ken Watanabe, although playing with a rather stiff facial expression, is believable and likable as the sometimes surprised, sometimes shocked scientist. And Kick-Ass... well he does a good job in playing the running man as well.<br/><br/>The plot is what you can expect from a monster movie like this. Humans cause trouble, Godzilla arrives, big monster fight scenes. However, what Edwards and his writer make out of this formula is far better than average. The characters are not too stereotype. The reason why Godzilla appears and why the plot evolves how it evolves is explained in a rather believable way.<br/><br/>The filmmakers made a good job in throwing all kinds of different scenes at you. Character drama, intense suspense (I just say railroad bridge), action, battles. Adding the well paced suspense curve, especially in the second half of the film, this film never gets boring.<br/><br/>The production design and the scale of the devastation is often caught in big aerial images. Thankfully, Edwards and his cinematographer avoided the use of shaky cam shot expect in 1st person or very close range shots. The big, calm images of Godzilla, the chaos and the destroyed cities transport a very realistic tone.<br/><br/>Thanks to the perfect sound design, the audience can feel the strength and the scale of Godzilla and [...] (No Spoilers, right? ;) ) and the devastation. His scream, every step, every crashing building is perfectly sounded. The bass is so intense, it pushes you in your seat. The seats were shaking. Go watch this film in a cinema with a very good and bass-y sound system. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>The CGI effects, and now we come to the master himself, are outstanding and simply perfect. If the Academy were open to this kind of film, I'd say we got our CGI Oscar winner here. Godzilla himself looks breathtaking, even with his gained mid-life-crisis pounds. His presence alone are great scenes and his fight with [...] are the icing on the cake. Those scenes are so good, I wish they had more screen time. Which is my only complaint worth mentioning for this film.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself gets two, three very strong scenes in this new film. I'd even say some are the best ever in the series. His full size reveal is an outstanding scene and made the audience cheer in my screening. Those scenes truly are ""HE IS BACK, B*TCHES!"" moments.<br/><br/>In my opinion, every scene in this film destroys the complete Emmerich film. Even better, in some scenes, it seems to make fun of the 98 film.<br/><br/>For me (us 3) as monster movie fans, this film is one of the best Godzilla movies to date, one of the best monster movies in years and it does not need to hide behind the Toho originals (as they were involved in some basic decisions).<br/><br/>9 / 10"
"walkingwithprimeval","2","3","5","3 January 2020"," Godzilla 2014 is NOT a good Godzilla film
","The music was good, Godzilla's design was nicely updated and the CGI overall was effectively convincing. And that's pretty much where my praise ends. Just thought I should get that over and done with first. Now that I've got all the positive stuff out of the way, I'll begin to explain why Godzilla 2014 is awful! It's quite possibly the worst giant monster movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The vibe I got from watching this miserable film all the way through from beginning to end was as if to say the filmmakers were totally embarrassed to be making a monster-action movie. Every time a fight between the colossal creatures was about to occurre the scene would almost immediately cut away to something else happening with the bland humans in the foreground while all the cool monster action you actually want to see takes place far in the background, which is something I find incredibly irritating as heck! Even when the film decides to focus on the monsters fighting one and other, it's still no fun to watch because of the dark and dreary cinematography which is set in the dead of night for the duration of the climactic battle. So I guess you could say this is a giant monster movie for people who don't like giant monster movies, much in the same way as how Game of Thrones is brutal and edgy fantasy for people who don't like traditional fairytale fantasy.<br/><br/>For me personally, the joyless viewing experience of the 2014 Godzilla was one where I can honestly say I downright HATED and absolutely wish to forget about."

Years have passed, and they still make these old-school movies, all with the same plot. At least, the Godzilla from 1998 tried to stun the audience with updated effects, some (bad) humor and the ""size matters"" refrain. Instead, this work from Gareth Edwards is flat and dull even in the action scenes. I didn't like Edwards in his awful ""Monsters"", but this is even worse."

","This movie was terrible, boring, and very annoying. I felt like I was stuck in ICU again. The human characters are pointless and stupid and they are the focus for 95% of the movie. The entire time I watched it I was hoping for something good/entertaining to happen and it didn't until the final fight at the end. This movie is like sitting in a terribly boring class. You're waiting impatiently for something good to happen but it doesn't until class is over (final fight starts). I believe a monster movie should be more than just fight scenes but in this one the fight scene is the only part worth watching. everything else was terrible. <br/><br/>I don't know why Mr. Cranston even signed on to do this. Killing him in this movie was the dumbest thing ever. So many people loved his portrayal of Walter White on Breaking Bad and would have loved to see him as the main character in a Godzilla movie. But no we get the dullest looking guy, clueless useless wife, and scientist that does nothing except look shocked and confused when the monsters do something. Its like the makers knew they were going to have a fight scene and just threw some garbage together and think it would pass as good build up when it doesn't at all. I seriously hated this movie because it could've and should've been good. Hopefully the sequel is either done as if this garbage was never made so they can bring Cranston back and some actual good actors on, or since a powerful nuke went off at the end and obviously wasn't far enough from the coast all these boring characters die of radiation poisoning or something so we can actually have a better movie. Do yourselves a favor. This movie is on HBO. If you want to watch it, wait until its got like 15- 20 minutes left and stop it once the fight is over. You won't waste your time and will see a decent fight.

","I am tempted to give it one out of ten, but that would not be fair as it does have a few good points. Unfortunately the good bits are out of the way half way through the movie and I was left bored and annoyed as the movie drew to a close. Ultimately not as entertaining as watching an old school version (any one will do).<br/><br/>Best character killed off too early, remaining characters are shallow. There are elements of the story which are pointless and fail to disguise the poor writing. The best part was the black and white clips during the introduction which set the scene for what looked like it could be great, but never delivered.<br/><br/>A lot of the action scenes are very dark to the point you can't see much, just silhouettes and monster noises. Got a few points for being visually stunning in places, and not being offensively bad to the point I would want it deleted from movie history - but if it were on TV I would not watch it again unless I was being paid.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour - watch Pacific Rim instead if you want to see something recent in this genre that is better (but it is not great either so be warned)."

"brchthethird","7","3","5","16 January 2015"," ""Let them fight!""
","Not having been able to go out to the theater too much last year, this was one of many films that I missed then but am catching up on now. While it wouldn't have made my top 10 for the year, this was definitely one of the best monster/disaster movies I've seen in recent memory. The story follows Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson), a Navy bomb disposal expert, who travels to Japan to get his father out of some trouble. His father used to work for a Japanese company, but after a cataclysmic event 15 years ago the area has been quarantined off, yet he still thinks that there's something going on besides the official story that it was a natural disaster. The ""thing"" actually turns out to be a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that they've been keeping contained. However when it escapes all hell breaks loose, and chaos and massive destruction ensue. Of course, you might be wondering where Godzilla fits into all of this. Despite the title of the movie, Godzilla only appears on screen for about 10-15 minutes. Still, the those precious minutes are worth it as he takes on the MUTO. One thing I appreciated about the film was that it didn't overexpose the monsters, instead letting the human drama take center stage. You get to spend time with the characters you'd most identify with, and the effects of a disaster were dealt with in a very realistic, down-to-earth way, even amongst all of the chaos and destruction. In fact, there was quite a large human cast such that I'd almost wish they'd delved a little deeper so that more time could be spent building things up. The worst offender is probably the prologue which set everything up. It was very effective in establishing a baseline, but not so much in terms of character building. Of course, all complaints aside, all of the performances were excellent. I just wish there had been more Bryan Cranston. In terms of visual effects and spectacle, this film stands head and shoulders above everything that came out in 2014. Scenes of destruction and mayhem were handled very well, and the creatures were also very well-animated. I should also mention the outstanding score by Alexandre Desplat, which hit all the right beats and fit the tone of the movie perfectly. Overall, I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't see this on the big screen but it was still an exciting viewing experience. It pays attention to its human characters and while the monsters don't take up too much screen time, when the action comes it delivers big time. Highly recommended."

","If you are expecting to see a lot of Godzilla in a movie titled ""Godzilla"", this is not the movie for you. Who knew that wanting to see the monster Godzilla in a movie named after the monster himself would be too much to ask. A more accurate title of the movie would be called ""MUTO (NOT Mothra)and Ford"" because those are what the movie centered around. For a movie whose previews and trailers looked so awesome and showed just enough of Godzilla to make viewers want to watch the movie, yet left them hanging as to what happens to Godzilla, the actual movie was extremely disappointing. Also, since when does Godzilla become a good guy. He is supposed to wreck havoc upon the town and try to eat people. Ugh, this movie does not deserve to even be called ""Godzilla""."

","Godzilla has been one of my favourite cinematic characters since I was a little kid, so getting the chance to see him rebooted properly for a mainstream audience was exciting. The film may not be perfect (pacing issues being it biggest flaw) and it's true that the human element leaves a bit to be desired, but the creatures themselves are wonderful and Alexandre Desplat's score is fantastic, sounding very much like an updated version of a 50's B- movie theme. It was also nice that the film treated itself very much like a traditional Godzilla adventure, as opposed to an overly serious Nolan- esque dull-fest.<br/><br/>Overall, not the best Godzilla flick, but a fun one for sure and that's all I really wanted from it. No more, no less."

","When you consider that this Japanese Kaiju creation, which, translated into English, literally means ""strange beast or creature"" was Japan's response to the destruction and devastation in the aftermath of the atomic bomb leveling Hiroshima and Nagasaki, any remake (or, reboot, to those of you are hip to the current terminology presently in use) seems irrelevant in 2014 and on. SPOILER ALERT: Yes, Warner Brothers is planning on a follow up sequel. Still, director Gareth Edwards and screenwriters Max Borenstein (screenplay) and Dave Callaham (story) have done their best to retain the spirit of those films back when ""Godzilla"" was King of the Monsters rampaging and stomping through an already downtrodden Tokyo. How and why ""Godzilla"" (back in the day when ol' radioactive breath was brought to life through suitmation, スーツメーション) would eventually become a celebrated champion capable of committing giganticide of any and all post-atomic mutations threatening Japan is a process which most creatures (the Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, et.al.), emerging from mere legend must undergo before passing into popular folklore. So, I suppose for this reason more than any other, the fact that talk of a sequel currently in the works is a good thing, because, ""it's good to be the king""!"

","HI all..I went to see the cinema release of this movie (Godzilla) back in May this year when it was first released....and have been sort of waiting for the DVD release...well...I picked one up the other day and have just watched the disc....all I can say is, to me, it doesn't seem the same movie! I'm sure it's been re-edited...and feel that some of the action sequences described on the board/review here are missing i.e. some of the, quote;'gorier'(?) parts where Godzilla fights the MOTU(?) and I don't remember it being so dark for so long too!! I note also that the original release (cinema) was at least 'PG' or something similar(?) And the DVD I have is rated '12'....WTF??? I don't buy movies for 'kids'...I'm a grown up !!! I feel distinctly 'cheated' somehow and it seems very dis-jointed somehow, compared to the movie we saw in May; it's a waste of money after seeing the original release....be nice to know if anyone finds the same things?? Regards JD x (Torbay, UK)."
"classicsoncall","8","3","5","14 October 2014"," ""We call him... Gojira"".
","I had a revelation as my summary line above was uttered by actor Ken Watanabe. If you use a low and raspy guttural voice, infuse it with a Japanese accent, and say it real fast, the word 'Gojira' sounds a lot like 'Godzilla'. Seriously, you should try it. And what's really cool, it also works in reverse. You can make 'Godzilla' sound like 'Gojira'.<br/><br/>Well I became a Godzilla fan way back when I was about nine years old in 1960 watching the New York based Million Dollar movie. Any movie that was featured for the week came on every single evening at 5:00 P.M. and this is one of the few flicks I watched five nights in a row. Now I don't know that I could say the same thing about this modern day remake, but I'm a traditionalist at heart anyway. For what it's worth, I thought the actual monster in this movie was pretty well done, but gee, he really wasn't on screen very long. Those mantis looking MUTO creatures were a little too metallic looking for my taste, I never took them as a real threat to the King of the Monsters.<br/><br/>No need to get too long winded here, I see the film has it's detractors and it's fans. In picking up this movie I was just looking for a couple hours of simple diversion and on that score it delivered. There was one great takeaway I got from the story, and I can't remember who it was uttered the line, but in commenting on the attempts by authorities in the movie to bring the creatures under control or defeat them, I was reminded of adherents of global warming hysteria. To them I would also offer - ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around""."

","Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. It is a reboot of the Godzilla film franchise and retells the origins of Godzilla in contemporary times as a ""terrifying force of nature"".[5] The film is set in the present day, fifteen years after the unearthing of two chrysalises in a mine in the Philippines. From the pods come two giant radiation-eating creatures, known as ""MUTOs"", which cause great damage in Japan, Hawaii and the western United States. Their awakening also stirs a much larger, destructive, ancient alpha predator known as ""Godzilla"", whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. It stars Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston. The screenplay is credited to Max Borenstein but includes contributions from David Callaham, David S. Goyer, Drew Pearce, and Frank Darabont."

","Not bad at all considering the fact Godzilla only appears after an hour! Wish we could see him longer. I didn't care about the human characters. They either die too quickly or don't do much throughout the film. David Strathairn was good as the Navy skipper though (he reminded me Sam Elliott minus the mustache). But when the monsters show up, hell yeah! It's a wild ride and Godzilla really kicks butts. I like the fact that the two MUTO look like rejects from Cloverfield and it's sweet to see Godzilla showing them who's the real boss. Because let's face it, Godzilla is like John Wayne. There can be only one! Forget about the version made by Rolland Emmerich."
"j-penkair","5","3","5","25 September 2014"," Godzilla Deserves A Better Film
","It seems truer as films after films go by, that more technology put in a film has equated the sum of heart and mind taken out of it. The latest ""Godzilla"" has exhibited such technology, and also such a loss in its soul. You can't produce a film thinking of technology first, with the story much second. The result is the likes of this film: visually extravagant and mentally crippled. Certain bits are breathtaking, but they can't save the soulless whole. Human characters in this film are entirely unnecessary, worthy perhaps only to reduce costs of technologically-depended scenes. Even Godzilla himself/herself is not allowed to show more heart and mind. There is a talk about ""balancing nature"" from the Japanese character, and that important sentence gets totally wasted. For this film, nature balance seems to let mindless creatures fighting one another to death, with the human onlookers learning nothing. Same as ""Karma"", most western filmmakers translate the term almost as ""irresponsibility"", while the actual meaning is more dynamic, relevant, and useful to their dead-end lives. This ""Godzilla"" is not even enjoyable. My best guess is that this bunch of filmmakers has a death wish for Godzilla and its most famous franchise."
"utgard14","6","3","5","18 September 2014"," ""I bet he's here to restore balance. He can defeat them.""
","I have mixed feelings on this movie. I liked it but felt it could have been so much better. The first hour drags on but I guess that's because it's taboo to do a movie under two hours these days if you want to be taken seriously as a filmmaker. The biggest gripe I have is one I'm sure is shared by many other viewers. Namely that Godzilla doesn't become a big part of the movie until late and so we basically have over an hour of a two-hour Godzilla movie devoted to humans and a new monster (with a terribly boring design). Once he does show up, the action and special effects are good but never so impressive as to make you forget the long wait. Of the humans, Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both good, as you might expect. Cranston is not the star, as the trailers would lead you to believe. The star is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and he does a fine job though nothing particularly noteworthy. Elizabeth Olsen, whom I adore, is largely wasted in a supported part where her only purpose is to survive the movie to be reunited with her husband. So is it worth seeing? Yes but temper your expectations. It's not as good as the original Godzilla (either version) or as much fun as the sequels. In many ways it has more in common with director Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters, than it does with Godzilla. If you liked Monsters (and I did) you'll probably like this. Maybe not as much, though."
"lordwerther","2","3","5","3 August 2014"," Strong Start but failed to deliver
","I didn't go to the cinema after I have seen the US trailer showing only US soldiers and Godzilla but no second kaiju. After I have seen the Japanese trailer with a second kaiju I had to see it. <br/><br/>You may guess that I'm not a fan of the other US ""Godzilla"". <br/><br/>Most Godzilla movies are using a simple formula... showing a wee bit of humans or some more but then having two kaijus fighting the hell out of each other. Everybody could write such a script.<br/><br/>Well, the movie starts with an awesome performance of one brilliant actor. It really makes you want more of the movie. However, this guy is the only one who is showing personality.<br/><br/>The main character is some good guy and that's all we learn about him. At some point he is fighting in the same town as his wife and his son lives but he isn't even mention them, he is just the good soldier guy.<br/><br/>The script is starting very interesting with nice ideas but soon it is just annoying and stupid. At some point the army isn't figuring out that half of a mountain is missing before they are inside a mine. <br/><br/>However, the army is always having helicopters or jets in the sky. This wouldn't be an issue in standard situations but if you figure out that every 5 minutes EMP waves were sent from a gigantic monster you shouldn't be in a flying vehicle.<br/><br/>OK, but what is about Godzilla? Well, the film is forgetting about him and so could I in this review. They have an awesome build up for a first fight but there is just a cut to day showing Godzilla swimming leaving fans disappointed.<br/><br/>All monster fights are held in the background and showing often in front the main actor.<br/><br/>The movie is full of pointless scenes which are leading to nothing. At some point the gave the main a boy by the side for no reason. The scene is of course having a kaiju attacking the scene and the hero saves the boy. After the scene the hero sees that the boy ran to his parents and is never seen or mentioned again.<br/><br/>The movie is such a let down as he starts very strong and as I was hoping that a non Japanese Godzilla could compete with the Millennium series as Toho was also involved. As much as I want to I can't recommend more than the first 30 minutes of this movie."

","I have to say I was disappointed with this film. I was so intrigued by the first half hour as we were brought into the events in a secret facility in Japan. One of the directors watches his wife die after a nuclear breech. Now we cut into the future. The director is still out there. He has become a crusader against the secrecy of this type of research. His son, who lost his other in the earlier incident, has become military and is really annoyed with his father's campaign. Now we throw all that aside. Dad has evidence, but has been arrested for treasonous acts. They see him as more of a nuisance than anything, but they have their own fish to fry. He manages to get back to the house where they lived (which is in rubble) and recover some old floppy disks. During this time, some sort of huge flat headed flying creature with spider legs has come to life. It is causing incredible destruction. Godzilla, who apparently is no secret, is moving around in the ocean. He is on a collision course with these other things. While the special effects are good, there is something really lacking in the story line, in the fights themselves, in the whole attitude toward these monster, and just a sort of malaise. I came to the theater excited because at midnight in 1957, I stayed up past my bedtime to her Raymond Burr in the Americanized version of ""Godzilla"" talk about the destruction of Tokyo. I have since watched so many of these movies, including the forgettable Matthew Broderick one, and I had hoped for some kind of earth shattering, apocalyptic presentation. For me, it was just an ordinary monster movie with little new to offer."

But the movie is named ""GODZILLA"" it's about him, right? So where is he? It turns out that GODZILLA is a bit player in his own movie. It's like having a movie called ""DRACULA"" and Dracula only appears in the last 10 minutes. The movie feels flat and very downbeat in attitude. There's a definite lack of dynamism in the whole production. In other words, it doesn't move you. I really did not care what happened to the characters on the screen. Compare this movie to the vastly superior ""Pacific Rim"" where the scene of the little Japanese girl running away from the huge monster in Japan had a definite impact on me. The acting in Godzilla was horrible. The fighting scenes between the monsters were boring. Who cares. Boring. When I start to think I could have done a better job in directing and producing a movie I'm seeing, there's something wrong with the movie. Go watch ""PACIFIC RIM""."

The humans are po-faced and lack character. there are no really likable characters like Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts in King Kong I'm afraid. Elizabeth Olsen has hardly anything to do. Godzilla doesn't get involved enough and comes over as a bit weak when fighting his main opponents. The T-Rex at the end of Jurassic park is harder and more vicious than this Godzilla.<br/><br/>I expected a bigger battle between the US army, navy and airforce and Godzilla. In fact I swear the armed forces were deliberately making life hard on themselves as far as taking the beasties out. The noble hero aspect of Godzilla was a bit Hanna-Barbra cartoonish.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a patch on Peter Jackson's King Kong which has better human characters, while Cloverfield did a better job of bringing about the end of the world vibe that Godzilla's misleading trailer alluded to.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is the untrue hype.

I think, that the director did the best he could, with an awful script. His low budget film, ""Monsters"" was much better, with much more tension and characterization. When they give you a whole heap of money to do a ""Blockbuster"", you can bet there are a whole lot of strings attached, by a gang of suits fretting over their investment. For me, this film lowers Garth Edwards' reputation, rather than raising it. Of course, the studio knows, that there are legions of gullible people, or teenagers with nothing to do, who will fill the theatres, for a ""Name Brand"" product like this, so they'll make money, even if the film is basically devoid of a great story, or human empathy. The only two good actors in the movie are killed off in the first twenty minutes, leaving the film to fly on auto-pilot. The Title character is only on the screen, for about 15 minutes, out of 2 and 1/2 hours. After the good actors die, it seems, that there is mostly a lot of genre filler, until the last 20 minutes. This movie reminds me of the abysmal ""Battleship"" plot-wise, although Edwards gives us some better visuals, showing his flare for style. I hope he goes back to lower budget movies, where he has more control over his product."

I was really hoping to see something brilliant and fascinating after I saw the trailers but....did not happen. -Acting was horrible besides Bryan Cranston's. -The MUTO's were a joke.... -You only see Godzilla towards of the end of the movie, and after waiting so much the final fight disappoints... -The ending was...forget that... And the story besides being bad...did not have much sense... This movie had a lot of potential but...everything went wrong.... I voted 1 of 10 because the movie is a 4 at best and they sell you a different movie in the trailers... If you are a Godzilla fan just watch the trailers"

","I grew up in the 70's watching Godzilla movies on Saturday mornings this movie was no better than those...sure it had better graphics but the story line was horrible.....Bryan Cranston was only in it long enough for them to put his name on the credits then he got the heck out of there like I should have done. I stayed and waited for the good part but it never came. The battle between the monsters was boring , the lead characters were boring it was just terrible and I paid extra for d-box seats and 3 d ,which the only thing standing out in 3 d was one part with a missile.

","I was totally underwhelmed by the movie. Nice CGI but that is not surprising; I would have been surprised if it wasn't. Decent fights, but no better than the 1950's versions with the exceptions of the special effects capabilities.<br/><br/>Horrible subplots in my view. There was very little if any chemistry between any of the main characters. The Japanese professor was clumsy and seemed in a daze or fog most of the time. Indiscriminate firing by the military rarely puts them in a good light by the way.<br/><br/>In my view, if Godzilla is going to end up being the good guy and save the world, perhaps the producers should have had all of human kind just a little grateful...just saying.<br/><br/>Glad I caught a matinée and not full price!"

","This movie has great action done incredibly well both on the visual and audio side. The story is not very original and there are major plot holes that one thinks will be explained before the end, but no. The characters are mostly forgettable. With the best ones being the father (played by Bryan Cranston from breaking bad) of the main character Ford Brody (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and a scientist (played by Ken Watanabe) are relatable and worth following. Ford Brody and his wife and child are really not worth getting upset about when they have hardship. <br/><br/>So Perfect movie if you just like action and monster fights and so forth (that part is epic) but just not enough to carry a movie in this day and age!

"s_imdb-623","2","4","8","12 April 2016"," A film made by 11 yr old minds
","There is nothing of any value in this film. Its boring. The CGI Godzilla monster was believable. Thats the only positive thing I can say here. I've given it higher than 1/10 simply for not being repellent. I would recommend people re-watch ANY of the old Godzilla films rather than this. Even if its a drunken party viewing. I liked many old B-movies, some that were really bad. So its nothing to do with the quality of the story, or making sense, or anything. They at least all had something; tension, likable characters, over-acting, really rubbish effects, etc. This film simply has nothing. And as its a modern film you'd think they'd update with all the latest military technology, but no. Also the MOTU monsters were pathetic. The only worthwhile acting was Cranston (his usual), but he was hardly in it. I really have no idea why they even thought about making this. Maybe they thought they'd just make money from the name Godzilla. So glad I did not go to cinema to watch it."
"atomikbuster","2","4","8","2 March 2016"," a movie that is for the technically retarded
","First of all, I've never watched the original Godzilla films, or read any kind of book about it. I'm not a big fan, at all. All I wanted was an action movie where some monsters fight each other... i got that more or less, but it's an insult to the intellect of anyone who has studied some basic physics in school. Where to start describing the atrocities? Well, there's those monsters who eat radiation, but no actual living thing can do that... radiation kills in reality. But maybe that was in the original comics/films, whatever. Second, they go to a nuclear fallout zone and wear gas masks on their face... for freaking WHAT? radiations are extremely high frequency radio signals, they are not some goddamn air poison. Third, regarding those frequencies, they show some spectrum analyzers with the sounds of the monsters on screens... they show them many times throughout the movie, only thing is, those are not audio spectrums, wavelengths, or whatever way to put sound into graphic form. Then there's the door in a nuclear power plant - a thin sheet of metal... right, like that's gonna offer any protection. and then we have the classical stupidity of people - shooting with small caliber guns at the monsters, and also just standing still and not running as the world around them is about to be obliterated... and the list can go on, and on and on. <br/><br/>The movie was mediocre but the way they insult one's intelligence is just unforgivable. Sound was OK-ish, did not intrude that much. Cinematography was also normal, not much of the transformers shaky cam stuff.<br/><br/>In the end, watch this one only if you want to punish yourself for something."
"jessegehrig","2","4","8","17 February 2015"," Why them people gotta talk through this movie?
","Made the movie then wrote the script, only later realized they did everything backwards. Instead of lots of monster fighting scenes there's lots of scenes of humans acting and delivering dialog, cause that's what people who go see a Godzilla movie want to see. When the monsters do fight and no actor is delivering worthless dialog, its either at night or in a dust storm, thus insuring that ninety percent of the fight is obscured. It's like the people who made this Godzilla did not understand the core concept of a Godzilla movie- it's supposed to be all about giant monsters that fight, watch any Godzilla movie other than the two American ones, it's all giant fighting monsters."
"demairo-seo","8","4","8","27 May 2014"," Godzilla has found a true admirer in Gareth Edwards.
","Godzilla has found a true admirer in Gareth Edwards. Someone who set out not only to envision a new future for Godzilla but to protect the previous Godzilla's long 60 year history, a man capable of delivering a Godzilla for our time. After seeing Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' it is my opinion that he has succeeded in mastering the vision for the monster that Tomoyuki Tanaka had in mind 60 years ago. Even though the original Godzilla will always be just that - the original, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is for me the first TRUE and complete representation of the vision of Godzilla. Executed in the most masterful of ways in direction by Gareth Edwards and in overall story by Max Borenstein. In delivering the picture that he has Gareth Edwards has completely put to shame directors such as Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich, Zack Snyder and the other go-to blockbuster directors. Injecting a surprising amount of suspense into this 'Godzilla' Gareth's Godzilla will have you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath in anticipation of what is next to come - something a Godzilla movie has not done since 1984. Unlike many of the reviews that I have read, I found the pacing of this movie to be absolutely fine, in fact I would have personally preferred a few more opportunities to catch my breath and gather my wits. Gareth Edwards has clearly given Godzilla the strongest opportunity for continued box office presence that he has ever had in the United States (although the burden of that task in my opinion seems almost insurmountable - and in all honesty - I would prefer to see this 'Godzilla' remain as it is, a superior standalone). A rebirth of epic (but not overwhelming) proportions this Godzilla harks back to the radiated and devastated scenes of Tokyo in Tomoyuki Tanaka and Ishiro Honda's original 1954 'Gojira' capturing with somber respect and sadness the human toll in stark contrast to most summer blockbuster movies in recent memory (especially 'Man of Steel' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness') Gareth Edwards and Max Borenstein can now rightfully join the likes of Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and Eiji Tsuburaya as masters of Godzilla."
"darkrai426","8","4","8","26 May 2014"," Have an open mind, people!
","I had been waiting eagerly to see this movie ever since the release of the first trailer. I felt for sure that when Godzilla 2014 hit theaters it was going to be the biggest hit of the year, and then the reviews were released. <br/><br/>All of them said the same thing. They called the movie 'The first big letdown of the year', the reasons being that it was 'too slow', 'no action', 'dull music', and the most revered complaint of all 'more humans, and little to no Godzilla.' Even the critics labeled the film as 'just another dumb B movie.' <br/><br/>I was let down, I had such high expectations for this film, only to be told that it is worth nothing, but none the less I kept my promise with my father, and we both went to see it a week after it's release. I was anxious the entire time I waited for the movie to begin filming, wondering if I will indeed be disappointed. In the end, I left the theater with the biggest smile on my face since 'The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug' <br/><br/>I loved this movie, all in all, and I am not even a Godzilla fan. Sure I saw two movies from the franchise, but they could never compare to Godzilla 2014. <br/><br/>The human side, being the main focus of the story, is done incredibly well. All of the actors did amazing in their roles, especially Bryan Cranston, whose performance brought me to tears not even fifteen minutes into the film. Do not come into this movie thinking he is the main lead, though, that role belongs to Aaron Taylor-Johnson. While Cranston's character is more interesting, I did not mind Johnson at all, and I rather enjoyed following the story through his eyes the rest of the way. He is not 'bland' as everyone claims he is, it is just how most military men are. <br/><br/>If you thought Avatar and Gravity had amazing effects, then you will need a definite change of pants when you see what Mr. Edwards has conjured. Not once did I see pathetic CGI, the creatures called MUTO were real, enormous, and terrifying. It brought me back to Spielberg's 2005 adaptation of 'War of the Worlds', the tripods frightened me then, and the MUTO's frighten me now. It surprises me that no one mentions the MUTO's in any of their reviews, the majority of the story revolves around the military chasing down these ancient parasites, which was exciting enough for me. I don't get how anyone could see this as boring. Of course, neither the army, or the MUTO's can compare to Godzilla himself. <br/><br/>I saw the King of the Monsters when he emerged from behind the Hawaiian airport, not a lame mutated iguana (I'm looking at you Roland Emmerich), and he is as incredible and bad-ass as everyone remembers him in the Toho franchise. When it comes to his screen time, we are offered mere glimpses, from his full body torso, to the dorsal fins swaying through the sea like massive shark fins, through out the film, until we see him in full action in the third act of the movie. I was satisfied with this, it brought me back to such films as 'Jaws' and 'Alien', where we are given small hints until the final act. <br/><br/>I was hooked into this movie as soon as it started, not once did I check my watch, or leave for the restroom, for two hours I stared at the screen, and felt all too tempted to applause when it finished. This is no lame B monster flick, this brought an atmosphere, and seriousness to Godzilla, I was taken back to the original Gojira film from 1954. While it has it's flaws, I easily look over them for the rest of the story. Haters and critics alike need to give this movie another chance, I found it better then 'Cloverfield', and even 'Pacific Rim'. <br/><br/>Thank you Gareth Edwards for bringing a classic monster back to the big screen, I look forward to the sequels. <br/><br/>9/10"

"p_tigershark","8","4","8","26 May 2014"," King of the Monsters!
","I grew up with Godzilla, I watched the Toho movies all the time as a kid and loved every one of them. I got very excited at the prospect of the 1998 reboot, but like most was bitterly disappointed with what I saw. I had consigned myself to the fact that there would never be decent big screen outing for Big G - thank goodness for Gareth Edwards is all I can say! Don't get me wrong, I wasn't that thrilled when Legendary announced that they were re-booting Godzilla again, but I became curious when they attached Edwards to the project, his breakthrough movie Monsters was superb and he was a self confessed Godzilla fan boy, it began to sound rather positive! As snippets of information began to emerge over time, it became clear that Edwards was looking to keep his Godzilla adaptation more faithful to the original and with blurry images and finally the glorious trailers my curiosity peaked - I had to see this movie and I'm glad I did! Edwards has assembled a great cast, Bryan Cranston (Joe Brody), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Ford Brody), Ken Watanabe (Dr Sherizawa), Elizabeth Olsen (Elle Brody)and Juliet Binoche (Sandra Brody) to convey the human side of the tale, which begins in Japan in what appears to be a tragic accident at the Jinjura nuclear plant which parallels what we've seen in recent years at Fukoshima. The events impact primarily on both Ford and Joe, the latter becoming a truth seeking conspiracy junkie who insists that there's more to the accident than the authorities are letting on and the former doing what he can to keep his father's obsession In check. Cranston's performance is excellent conveying desperation, tenacity and sadness in the face of what he witnessed. Taylor-Johnson's Ford is an adequate hero. He's acutely aware of his father's eccentricities and has to balance keeping him in check with both a military career and a young family. While Taylor -Johnson does a good job, he doesn't ever truly convince and as such you're not overly invested in what he does - a shame. Elizabeth Olsen is Taylor-Johnson's love interest, underused and somewhat throwaway in her role and Juliet Binoche has a small part as Ford's mother at the start of the movie, the scenes between Binoche and Cranston are great. That leaves only Watanabe as Dr Sherizawa, a scientist belonging to a shadowy corporation named Monarch, he knows what caused the accident at Jinjura and is keeping as tight a lid on it as he realistically can. As with most movies Watanabe is attached to, he does a superb job, he does spend a lot of time looking like he's thinking about mortgage rates, but he does convince in his role and ultimately makes the decision to let chaos reign as a means to restore order - good plan! The human element do a fine job in channelling the story from one element to another, it does go without saying that when the action starts, they play second fiddle to the VFX, but at least there is a story underpinning the action, helmed by decent actors who admirably do their bit until the big fella arrives! Well, onto Godzilla himself. I've read a lot of reviewers and critics complaining that there wasn't enough of Godzilla and that he took his sweet time turning up! Edwards has clearly adopted the less is more approach with his treatment of Godzilla. Yes, he could have had Godzilla bold as brass stood there from the very start, but Edwards allows the story to develop and for the tension the build before Big G is ready for his close up. His approach is very reminiscent of some of the older generation of creature features (Jaws, Alien & Cloverfield spring to mind) in so far that we have snippets that build into a final reveal, and what a reveal it is! There are no doubts in my mind that Edwards has taken the right approach to Godzilla, If he hadn't, he could have allowed this movie to become a Transformers-esque descent into CGI based tedium where loud noises and countless CGI explosions dull the senses and numb the mind - thank goodness this didn't happen. When Godzilla is revealed, it's an event, it's a pay off of epic proportions, when I saw the movie a cheer went up through the screen, which is strange for U.K based audiences, everyone was happy to see him. I'm certain that if we'd seen him in all his glory in the first 5 minutes he would have very quickly lost that sense of majesty as the film continued, here, every time he is on screen Godzilla seizes and holds the audiences attention and thanks to an amazing design coupled with epic VFX, he is every inch the titan he should be.<br/><br/>Well, there you have it. Godzilla is proof that with the right director, the right actors and the right approach you can still make excellent creature features. The action is non-stop, the destruction is mighty and the effects are epic. Yet there is a story here, it's decent and relevant. This movie isn't perfect, but Edwards has expertly exorcised the demons of the 1998 version and had given Godzilla fans a glimpse of greatness."

The story / plot somehow pushes forward quite fast although it is a 2 hours movie. Some details can be explained more in the movie to make the film editing smooth.

"Spartan41489","5","4","8","20 May 2014"," Godzilla 2014
","First off, i grew up with all the old 60's-90's Godzilla movies and when i heard that there was going to be a remake/re-do of Godzilla, hopefully done right and not like the 1998 movie, i got really excited.<br/><br/>I went and saw the movie this past weekend and honestly left disappointed.<br/><br/>For starters, no matter how good the CGI is and how amazing Godzilla looked, which honestly was nothing that fantastic, it does not compare to someone wearing a suit. The movements look unnatural and fake, and the true essence of Godzilla can not be captured no matter how good a computer can make him look. Not to mention the stupid monsters they created for Godzilla to fight in this one, i know it was a huge let down in the 1998 movie that ""Zilla"" didn't have any opponent to fight, but if you are going to create something as stupid as these monsters just let Godzilla destroy stuff on his own.<br/><br/>Also as a Bryan Cranston fan i was hoping he would bring a solid acting performance to the series, which hasn't really seen a real actor since maybe Raymond Burr. Cranston gives a solid performance for the time he is in the movie, which is not long.<br/><br/>The other acting is sub-par at best, Ken Watanabe was really lack luster compared to his performance in The Last Samurai or Inception, and you can barely understand anything he says, which i suppose does fit a Godzilla movie despite not being dubbed over in English.<br/><br/>Verdict on this one, if you are a true to heart Godzilla fan like myself you will walk away from this one very let down, if you enjoy sub-par computer animated monsters and stale acting this one might be right for you."
"armin947","8","4","8","17 May 2014"," That's a lot of fis---wait....WHERE DID THIS DECENT MOVIE COME FROM?
","This is my first review on IMDb, so you'll have to excuse me.<br/><br/>First of all, let me say that this movie exceeded far beyond my expectations. I thought that this was going to be another corny and ridiculous money-grab just like the disastrous joke that was made in 1998. However, although I was pleasantly surprised with what I got, I still have some big issues with this movie.<br/><br/>I'll start with positives I saw. Since they (for the most part), overshadow the negatives:<br/><br/><ul><li>Unlike the 1998 version which DID NOT take itself seriously in the slightest, this movie absolutely caught on the perfect dark, gloomy and gritty atmosphere for what a Godzilla movie should be like, and with the CGI technology we have today; this certainly did NOT disappoint in the slightest.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI effects are top-notch and just look fantastic. Believe me this is not a lie, but when Godzilla's tail and the spikes on his back began to glow blue and he released the atomic breath, I got up in the theater and clapped, I didn't care if I got made fun of by the people behind me. That was honestly one of the most badass things I've seen in a long time.</li></ul><br/><br/>The negatives:<br/><br/><ul><li>The biggest issue I had with this movie is probably the fact that it did NOT know what to do with itself. It set itself up with a perfect tone, perfect story (adding on stuff like the old nuclear bomb clips claiming that those were not tests, but rather they were trying to get rid of Godzilla was a perfect idea), but it just did not know when to be action or adventure. Whenever we got into a spine-tingling action sequence in the first half-quarter of the movie, it gets cut off......WHAT THE F#(@????? You have absolutely no idea how irritated and disappointed I got whenever that happened because it would immediately cut it off and then five seconds later they would show 2 second clips of the fight through a simulated news report in a different scene. Yes, I know what the fanboys are going to say; ""OH DUDE, YOU DON'T GET IT MAN, YOU SHOULD STICK TO MICHAEL BAY MOVIES, YOU SHOULD GO WATCH DIE HARD OR SOMETHING!!"". Let me tell you right now I would sit through a few movies that I love such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Requiem for a Dream, or an anime series called ""Serial Experiments Lain"" which have no action in them at all, and I could tell you RIGHT NOW that mixing in subtlety in a Godzilla movie is a terrible idea. Godzilla movies are not about subtlety, but rather about something as simple as watching giant monsters beat the living crap out of each other. Sure, give us the story more in depth and deeper dialogue but don't you dare take my action from my Godzilla movies. That's like talking to a girl you like and your best friend comes and cockblocks you.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters are just unbelievably boring and cardboard cutouts of different stories of other movies.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole movie is titled Godzilla, but it took nearly an hour before we got to see a first glimpse of him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I got a few more negatives but they would probably qualify under nitpicking.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall though, my final score would be 7.5. It was worth the money to see it in the big screen. Let go a few bucks and have some fun."
"chriscorona-design","6","4","8","17 May 2014"," Not enough Godzilla. Too much flat plot
","This film gets a 6 because of Godzilla and Brian Cranston. When neither of them are on screen, it was all yawns.<br/><br/>Audiences are going to see Godzilla for, wait for it, Godzilla. So when you're going to wait till act 3 to show a full fight, you'd better make it worth it. Instead we're treated to a flat plot with characters who have no development. We're talking paper thin. The most interesting character (and best acted), Brian Cranston, is killed off within the first 30 min. Talk about a let down.<br/><br/>This movie seemed to be teased on how Godzilla (and friends) affect people on the ground. Which was an interesting concept, that I honestly felt was worth exploring. Unfortunately, like mentioned earlier, none of this (and there's a lot!) holds up. They tease you with Godzilla just too peak your interests,then show him for all his glory in act 3. Let me say, he shine gloriously in act 3!<br/><br/>I think people are rating it so well, solely for act 3. That's an issue. You can't ignore flat characters, countless plot holes, bad acting, killing off of the best (human) character, and then say the movie is amazing because of a 3rd act. I guess you can though, because that's what everyone is doing.<br/><br/>Personally I say go the route of Pacific Rim. If you're going to have flat characters, than at least make the spotlight Godzilla. Let him fight multiple monsters, and have him shown throughout the movie. Otherwise give us something to chew on when he's not around."
"stevendbeard","8","4","8","16 May 2014"," Great Reboot But Slow Start
","I saw ""Godzilla"" starring Bryan Cranston-Breaking Bad_t.v., Malcolm in the Middle_t.v.; Aaron Taylor-Johnson-Kick-Ass in the Kick-Ass movies, Savages, Elizabeth Olsen-Oldboy, Silent House and David Strathairn- Alphas_t.v., the Bourne Identity movies. FYI: Aaron is playing Pietro Maximoff and Elizabeth is playing Wanda Maximoff in the next Avengers movie.<br/><br/>This is a reboot of the Godzilla franchise and it's a lot better than the last one that had Matthew Broderick in it, back in 1998. First of all, Godzilla actually looks like the Godzilla that we all know and love. Secondly, there are some good monster fights-yes, there are other giant monsters that Godzilla tangles with in this one. This year is also the 60th anniversary of Godzilla-the first movie was in 1954. My only complaint was that it was a little slow getting to the good stuff-it was about 45 minutes to an hour before the big G even shows up. Anyway, the movie starts about 15 years ago with Bryan as a scientist in Japan that is working on a nuclear reactor. He spots trouble but, of course, nobody will listen to him and after a small disaster, the government covers it up. Jump to the present and Bryan is still trying to prove his theories but is considered a nut-job. Aaron plays his son, who is in the military and Elizabeth plays Aaron's wife. David is in charge of the military forces that try to control the giant monster battle royale. The monster action covers a lot of geography, including Japan, Hawaii, California and Nevada. It's rated ""PG-13"" for the creature violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"thomwestermark","8","4","8","15 May 2014"," Cloverfield can go suck his thumb, the king of all monsters is back
","I am in the habit off saying that a movie should be reviewed on it's own merits and not affected by external influences. But it is with great regret I say that I was a huge fan of the Godzilla movies as a child. The amount of hours I spent watching Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla when I was 4 and 5 is more or less innumerable. I absolutely adored everything about the beast. And I despised everything about 98, American remake, which despite CGI and being set in New York was an insult to the Godzilla I had watched obliterating King Ghidorah and Destroyah. Fastfoward to 2014 and I was in the cinema with mixed expectations for the new adaption. It was a must watch, but I didn't know quite what I would think. So it was a huge surprise to me, when the movie took a turn from ''bland heroic effort for humanity to destroy monster ( read: Cloverfield, Pacific Rim ) '' into ''monster punchup ala classic Japanese movies and anime''. I totally was not expecting the movie to introduce other beasts than Godzilla, with massive appetite for destruction ( and nuclear waste ). So was the movie pleasing to me as a Godzilla fan? Well, the Godzilla parts was absolutely pleasing. When I heard the big guy roar at the top off his longues with his Godzilla roar, I was squeeling like a child on Christmas. If I would have been five years old, the scream would literally make me cry in happiness. This is however, the problem with the movie: As good work as Edward has done with much of the movie, most of the film is not about Godzilla. Most of his appearances is teasing and while it keeps you hungering for more, it doesn't keep your appetite wet. And that is courtesy to the cast off humans that try to make sense out of their circumstance and integrate the situation. Most of the characters do not quite feel like they a cog in the mechanism off the movie. They did for the first 30 minutes, where Ryan Cranston delivers with true charisma. However, the rest off the cast is sadly 2 dimensional and many off them could have died in the first five minutes without any change in sense really. It is of course, necessary with these human characters, otherwise we would get ''short attention span'' type off movie. Unfortunately, it is not pulled off very well and while it is clear that the human interactions are meant to make the movie ''the dark knight'' of Monster flicks, it just isn't very interesting.<br/><br/>But in sense, this is still the dark knight off monster flicks: the movie quickly catches up in an epic finale of monster clashing, that managed to maintain my massive throbbing erection. For that I am willing to forgive the movie for it's mistakes, whosever fault it is that the character development was poor, I am willing to forgive that, as long as it would in a potential sequel would managed to catch up. All-in-all, you can sort off say that this is a movie analogous to eating ferrero rocher dipped in wet paper. It's not a bad experience in any sense, it just makes more sense to buy your ferrer rocher at a different store."

","Alright if you're reading this, you're going to get some spoilers.<br/><br/>First, the story opens up okay. It's a little like a made for TV movie at first, but when Cranston comes in, you feel a lot better. His part really lets you believe he's going to be part of the entire film. WRONG, he dies in a helicopter. Oh and who takes over? His no-name actor son (Taylor-Johnson) and Ken Watanabe (the guy who owns the airline in Inception).<br/><br/>First I love Cranston from B.B., so why kill him early? He totally sets up a decent film until he dies. Then it's all down hill.<br/><br/>Second, I really like Watanabe. He's a great actor, why does he look like he's really depressed, really tired, or really drugged on something during every shot. Seriously, go back and look at him - he's a total mess, but he happens to be the one and only scientist who knows everything about the monsters.<br/><br/>And third, the love/family scenes between Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olson (one of the Olson's who plays the wife) with the kid who looks like the kid version of Peter Dinklage does not need to be in the film. It really lacks the sympathy for them. Godzilla should've squashed that story or blew blue fire at them to make the audience feel better.<br/><br/>Last but not least, people are comparing this to Pacific Rim. DON'T. We knew that Pacific Rim was suppose to be campy and over the top, we were not suppose to take it seriously. This film tried too hard to do that. Don't waste your time or money. If you're a Breaking Bad fan, look somewhere else. Cranston's in it for a few minutes. :("

","There is zero substance to this film, made worse by the fact that the director tries to add substance with extra monsters, clichéd subplots and absolute nonsense (see Japanese boy temporarily losing his parents).<br/><br/>The plot is forced in every way. From the protagonists family peril (Oh no! They're converging in San Francisco!) to the arrogant American Military 'C U Next Tuesdays' we've seen and been irritated by a million cruddy times.<br/><br/>The only leg this film has to stand on is the action and SFX. But these are both too few and far between for any thinking man not to be annoyed that they just spend their hard earned cash on a gimpy leg at best.<br/><br/>I guarantee there is NOTHING in this film that hasn't been done before, but with more impressive results."

","When I heard some time ago that Gareth Edwards, director of the fabulous film ""Monsters"" had been chosen to reboot the Godzilla franchise, I was ecstatic. ""Monsters"" was such a brilliant film in that the monsters played only a very small role in a well-crafted film about people dealing with unprecedented circumstances. The film was carried not by special effects, but by character development, engaging plot, solid pacing, and breathtaking visuals on a small budget. With the Godzilla reboot, it's as if Edwards purposely went in the exact opposite direction with a recognition that today's film-going audience isn't looking for any depth whatsoever, but rather a ridiculous amount of computer-generated effects in which all other elements of the film (characters, plot, acting, pacing, script, everything) are thrown completely to the wayside.<br/><br/>Despite the absurd amounts of money that must've been spent creating the film, Edwards' ""Godzilla"" never breaks free of the b-movie elements of the 1950's. I don't know that this quite counts for a spoiler, but the plot of the movie was truly as simple as: Nuclear something or other, giant monsters, mass destruction, monster battle, the end. The lead characters hardly seemed to react to the fact that there were giant monsters running a muck. They simply geared up, grabbed some nuclear weapons (literally, they were carrying nukes by hand) and pursued the creatures. I suppose it's my fault for expecting a giant monster movie to have any depth. However, even if you only go to this movie for Godzilla, you'll see him for only an incredibly small portion of the film. Even the 3D aspects of the film seemed elusive / non-existent. Save your money and go to the zoo or something. I guarantee the creatures there will be much more entertaining."

","Godzilla is another highly anticipated release coming to screens for summer 2014. As soon as the movie starts you are plunged into a dizzying array of realistic and actual nuclear footage providing the back drop and subplot for the entire movie. As the characters and plot begin to develop you begin to wonder how much time Godzilla will actually be on screen. Worry not because the giant monster makes his debut and all the scenes featuring him are of doomsday quality and important to the plot. The pure visual aspect of this movie is incredible and awe inspiring especially when seen on a 3d or IMAX screen. Godzilla has a very unique 'personality' and character in this film which is surprising to say the least. He takes on a role of an anti-hero of sorts and actual may have some heroic qualities within him that may add a novel aspect to his screen appearances in comparison to modern takes on the monster cult classic. There are some great dramatic footage in this film as well which add to the air of suspense only to be smashed and grabbed by the ultimate action packed monstrosity hitting screens this summer. Other films be warned, Godzilla is a blockbuster of extreme quality literally roaring off the screen in 3d and dolby digital and is destined to be a future classic."

","This new Godzilla movie could have easily fallen into the trap of being a mindless action movie. It could have been a quick cash grab the next 'Transformers', but instead this movie chose to have a soul. <br/><br/>From the start Godzilla is a very emotional film, and continues to be the entire time. This movie managed to make me care about the humans which few (if none) giant monster movies ever have. However, Godzilla isn't truly a 'giant monster movie', it is more of a disaster film.<br/><br/>Other good things: The director cleverly uses camera angles to portray the humans as actual humans, not just a crowd. Similarly, main characters a placed in key positions that make every act of destruction meaningful--every action has a shown consequence. Finally Godzilla is the as cool as he's every been. He's very animistic, and very large. If your worried about him being CGI don't be, he's more emotive than ever. <br/><br/>Complainants: Not enough Godzilla and not enough action. Most of all the action is held for the end, and most of the movie had to be carried by the actors. <br/><br/>Recommendations: Don't go in expecting a lot of action. Go in expecting a lot of emotion. Don't bring kids, they will be bored. My 10 year old brother saw it with me and loved it, but anyone much younger would probably be bored. <br/><br/>Conclusion: A very powerful very original movie that manages to create very humane, humans. Also not a traditional action film, but a disaster film with monsters in it. Biggest problem is not enough of it's title character. <br/><br/>I highly recommend to non-Godzilla fans as well as Godzilla fans. 9/10"

","The movie which i had been waiting for a long long time. I still remember the first time i saw Roland Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" in 1998, to be honest at that time i quite liked the movie. But, the movie was a major flop, not getting a thumbs up from critics as well as from the audiences. It took total, 16 years to make ""Godzilla"" happen again with worldwide release. The other Godzilla movie only released in some of the Asian countries. The hype with this flick was enormous. As the first trailer rolled, people went buzzards to see the movie as soon as possible. So, does this live up to the hype? The Answer is YES, obviously.<br/><br/>The movie starts in Japan, in which a young scientist, Joe Brody played by the ""Breaking Bad"" fame ""Bryan Cranston"", studying the seismic activity around the nuclear plant he & his wife is working in. He believes that the seismic activity that has been going on is not due to earthquakes but due to electro magnetic pulse & believes something is hiding in this place as it is the only plant & place who is experiencing it. In all this, Joe loses his wife due to a lethal gas leak in the plant & due to this seismic activity, whole plant is turned into dust & is named a ""Quarantine Zone"" after the incident. After, 15 years, his son ""Ford Brody"" played by ""Aaron-Taylor Johnson"" is in US Army's Bomb Disposal Team & is now living happily with his wife, Elle, played by ""Elizabeth Olsen"" & his son Sam. But, Joe is still finding his way to know the truth that what caused that activity, to which he goes to his old house in Quarantine zone with his son, but sees that their is no radiation in that zone & Government, is just covering it up. He gets, what he has come for, the documents & disks which tells that something responded to the waves that were sent by Joe, to know exactly what is going on inside the earth's core. Police finds both father & son & takes them to the plant, which was said to be closed but in real is not. The scientist, ""Dr Ichiro Serizawa"" played by ""Ken Watanabe"" (Inception fame) & his team has found something which is showing a very high radiation. To, which Joe, says that he already knew that it was the earthquake, it was something else hiding underground. When they see that nothing is happening they decide to kill the structure but it turns out that the structure needs radiation to get more power. So, in turn to kill it, they free out a creature named ""MUTO"", who is man-made genetically engineered monster. In order, to kill this ""MUTO"", Dr. Seriwaza believes that only & only, ""Gojira"" can kill this monster. Will Gojira be able to stop this monster?, Is MUTO alone?. Well, i will give you no spoilers as many people are yet to see the movie.<br/><br/>""Gareth Edwards"" is the director of the movie, who has the made the small budget, sci-fi hit ""Monsters"". But, he needed something big to this movie & he has done that. Edward;s latest venture ""Godzilla"" is not just a 3D bonanza, but he also maintains a fine grip on the narrative as the action-adventure moves on. The movie's script has an interesting spin, which i cannot discuss in detail, or that would be spoiler for all. I would just say that ""Godzilla is a Good Guy Here"".<br/><br/>The human drama content in this movie works. I hear people saying, human part was a bit-too much, now you can't just see ""Godzilla"" for whole 2 hours on the screen. It had to be there. This creature feature film, that is primarily meant for violence & special effects, the movie has got some good & interesting names in the movie, Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of an army man & also Joe's son, he quite good in his role, providing some insights of the life of Joe & Ford, as dad & son. But, sometimes looks stiff on the screen. Ken Watanabe, has a good role & is amazing in it. Elizabeth Olsen, shown as fun loving girl, who loves his husband & son, is a fun to watch, even with a role that is very short. Bryan Cranston, is spectacular in this short role & the emotions he shows during his scenes are fantastic. Now, the main hero of the movie, oh you know, ""Godzilla"", some of the people in Japan said that this Godzilla is too fat. Well, they are right, he is a little fat. But, he is as fit as a fighter, when he fights in the movie. The time he comes on the screen, the visuals are breath-taking & the entry he gets, you would just want to ""clap"" for the beast to come in.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers, played a deadly game to come up with this project, after the debacle of Sony's ""Godzilla"" in 1998 & they have done a smart job. I can see, a whole new franchise for ""The King Of Monsters"".<br/><br/>GO WATCH THIS BEAST! RECOMMENDED!"

","I could not even believe my eyes the first time Godzilla came onto the screen. Listen when I tell you that all 160,000,000 million dollars of their budget must've been spent on this bad boy because he was unreal. Now I personally saw the movie in IMAX so i'm sure the experience that others may have had who didn't see it in IMAX wasn't as good but i cannot imagine it was anything but Spectacular. <br/><br/>Now that iv'e gotten that out of my system time to tear the movie apart. Bryan Cranston appeared to be the face of the film in the trailers and when you actually watch the movie the brief amount of time he is in the film isn't all that spectacular. In a wrap he is a necessary catalyst that could've been played by a less notable actor and achieved the same feelings. But please understand that in no way was he bad in the film, it was just that his role was underwhelming given how much you see him in the trailer. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a great job in their roles and I give them a warm applause. Ken Watanabe was either the worst actor to come across the face of the earth or was told to do some of the stupidest things i've ever seen. Throughout the entire film he just stands around watching monsters with a stupid-ass look on his face (Pardon my French). By the end of the film I think that he was a professional at having his mouth hang open because that is essentially the ONLY thing he does for the entire film. <br/><br/>All in All I REALLY liked the FILM but I did not approve of the Actors for the most part. I feel as though some more reliable people could've been put into some roles. In Cranston's case they needed to have more screen time for him or just get someone else and with Ken well Ken's just a lost Cause. I would say this film is great for anyone looking for some CGI and great action scenes filled with non-stop action, excitement and peril. But if your going for the build-up of a story and great acting, don't bother it isn't worth your time. Sorry if I come across as a little Cynical but you can see from my rating that I did truly enjoy the movie but i'm a critic and i have to give it to you the way it is."

I know I need to watch the 1954 original which I plan to do here real soon. I was told to avoid the 1998 version which I saw a video clip of the ending of Godzilla 98. Pretty much that Godzilla looked like a roided up T-Rex from Jurassic Park. Not impressed. So I go into this movie after viewing trailers for it and I was getting excited. had a feeling that this was going to be a kick ass monster movie and it is.

","So for starters if you have watched the earlier version of Godzilla (1998) then I must first tell you that its not anything like the that movie. That movie had an appropriate blend of Godzilla, and the actors, with everyone sharing ample movie time. This new version takes a different angle and tries to show us something that we would not think of when we first sit down to watch a monster movie.<br/><br/>The movie's not a bad one. It just takes time to set its thrill and action running. Little heads up: You need to be very patient with this one. The actors have done a good job esp. Bryan. There is not much of role of Ken Watanbe in this movie.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are too good. The devastation and the fights are very much entertaining, not to mention the x-factor of the Godzilla, its roar. My god I am a huge fan of that roar, its simply the best.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie with not much of expectations like good story telling, suspense, actors that were fulfilled by the earlier Godzilla. Some people with a flair of plenty of action and a tendency to get bored by lots of dialogs during the movie might get bored at times. But it's definitely worth a watch. After all you are going to see a different image of Godzilla.<br/><br/>Enjoy the movie for the enormously beautiful CGIs, cities getting destroyed, and most important the ROOOOAAARRRRR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"xamtaro","9","5","11","22 May 2014"," Combining the best elements from 60 years of Godzilla
","A king had once reigned supreme. But in 2004, Godzilla the king of monsters hung up his crown after a disappointing Final War. But soon, giant monsters started returning to screen; 2005's KING KONG, 2006 korean movie THE HOST, 2008's CLOVERFIELD, all vying for the title of king. Now 2013 comes up with PACIFIC RIM But No king is going to let a kaiju army steal his thunder! So up from the depths steps GODZILLA to show these usurpers how a monster movie is really done.<br/><br/>In shaping Godzillas future, the creative team look back on the big G's past, digging deep into the earlier, darker themed Showa era Godzilla movies and combining the best elements of 60 years worth of sequels. Like the first 1954 original, the monsters' appearance is teased and glimpsed through the human focused tale. This is slow build up and reveal calls back to classic monster movies like JAWS, ALIEN, and the original GODZILLA. Yet director Gareth Edwards successfully builds the tension right up to the big payoff clash of titanic proportions. With No oxygen destroyer, masers, mutant soldiers or other wonky scifi stuff from the Japanese movies, this new Godzilla movie is grounded firmly in contemporary reality. A dangerous move which the 1998 giant lizard remake tried to pull off, though one that ultimately paid off here.<br/><br/>Godzilla's design raised mixed reactions from viewers, but when seen in full motion, this bigger, meaner but definitely not leaner Godzilla is amazing! The design just screams ""power"" and makes sense for a creature of that size; thick skeletal structure, low centre of gravity, tough meaty exterior and smooth streamlined shape makes it believable that this creature can survive the ocean pressure near the earth's core, swim from Hawaii to San Francisco in a matter of hours yet support it's weight out of water. In motion, this is not the awkward lumbering Japanese rubber beast, but a menacing massive yet graceful Titan with an intelligent spark in his eyes. This wearied, bulkier looking Godzilla feels like an old champion wrestler forced back into the ring to reclaim his title.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was what the creators were going for. The feel of an apex predator who, aside from some pesky atomic bombs giving him a mild sun burn once in a while, has not had a decent giant monster challenge in eons. Godzilla is aching for fight and when a couple of mating obsessed MUTOs wander through his turf........let's just say nobody lays eggs in the King's back yard. Director Gareth Edwards eschews frantic close ups for wide angle, full view cinematography, allowing every monster appearance on screen to be seen in its full glory. Special effects by ""moving pictures company"" and ""amalgamated dynamics"" bring the king of monsters to life, rivaling that of the more renown ILM or Weta.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this new movie just oozes with the best elements of 60 years of GODZILLA movies without any of the goofiness. The two enemy monster MUTOs resemble Orga and Megaguirus, two kaiju created in the millennium era Godzilla movies, in their fighting style and design. This bigger, bulkier Godzilla takes design cues from the Heisei era and Godzilla: Giant monsters All Out Attack, while his almost human-like intelligence recalls the ""heroic"" Showa Godzilla movies. Even Godzilas nuclear breath is a burning blue stream of irradiated particles like the Showa ear, rather than the dragonball Z styled giant laser beam of more recent Godzilla shows.<br/><br/>But enough about Godzilla. How do the mandatory human characters fare? Well Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody is magnificent. He brings gravitas to his character and a heart wrenching emotional touch. Sadly, he is under utilized as the script focuses on Ford Brody. Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance is a little disappointing considering his character is a soldier. He mumbles his way through the movie in a wimpy little voice, sharing only a passing chemistry with his wife, played by Elizabeth Olsen.<br/><br/>Fans of all action monster mash ups like GODZILLA FINAL WAR or DESTROY ALL MONSTERS would no doubt find the slow burn build up boring. But fans of the 1954 classic and the more serious Showa era movies would have much to cheer about. With a nostalgic score by Alexander Desplat clearly inspired by the late great Akira Ifukube, GODZILLA serves as a harrowing metaphor of nature's supremacy over mankind. Where the 1954 classic was an analogy for the atomic bomb, 2014's movie brings to mind the tsunamis and nuclear plant meltdowns that shocked the world. A clever, emotionally engaging and powerful tribute to 60 years of Godzilla."

","Let me start by saying I was a great fan of the original Godzilla (the Japanese movie from 1954). The movie practically changed the way I perceived reality as a kid. <br/><br/>This recent Godzilla movie was a total let down on every front imaginable. First of all the story was nothing like the original, it looks like they didn't watch the original movie. Its the same with terminator one and terminator two (horrible sequel). <br/><br/>The Godzilla was far from believable. The special effects let me down so hard. Also I didn't understand why the meth cook from breaking bad was in this movie, this made it very confusing for me because I was watching Breaking Bad the night before. So I thought at one point, what is Godzilla doing in breaking bad. I thought it was one of those meth trips from the 1970's. But then suddenly the guy from Kick-Ass shows up, and I was sure it wasn't breaking bad anymore.<br/><br/>This movie, which was a total Borefest, had little to no story to it. The action was boring and monotonous. Why is the drug addict Olsen part of this movie? Are they trying to tell us something? Well they paid her enough money to buy more drugs.<br/><br/>Also, let me tell you something about the ""director"". Roland Emmerich did such a poor job, you can barely even call him a director. More like a guy who is cutting images together in some sort of pretentious collage. Even my mother is a better director and she hasn't seen a movie in her life.<br/><br/>The reason I give this movie 2 instead of 1 is because I had a good night with my mistress after. I'm usually not a very hard critic, but this movie really got on my nerves. Still a 2 is better than 1.<br/><br/>Hope you like my review,"
"zachdriehorst","8","5","11","21 May 2014"," Perfect for the Godzilla fan, not so much for anyone else
","This isn't your Daddy's Godzilla flick. It's much more serious. <br/><br/>The main plot focuses on how the US Military (Navy mostly), and a bomb technician, whose mother was killed by a monster, and later his father too (there goes Bryan Cranston's screen time). Ford Brody is a decent main character, whose reaction to everything seems to be helping with the Navy to keep his mind active and to hide his emotion. Just about every other character are one-dimensional, and that's acceptable because the movie is much more about Ford Brody and the monsters than anyone else. The movie also takes a more serious look at the damage by constantly putting children in the way of danger.<br/><br/>Now onto the monsters. Most of the action is very human related, but delivers intensity and kept me on the edge of my seat. The monster fights are not the usual clumsy battles due to CGI, which is also done well. Hype is everything in this movie. The monster fights are teased several times, and almost every Godzilla appearance comes with some cool intro for him. <br/><br/>In summary, normal movie fans will probably get caught up in mediocre to poor acting/dialogue, a relatively simple plot, and the lack of Bryan Cranston. But a Godzilla fan will probably come away refreshed with a much more serious take on their often too-corny-for-his-own-good favorite monster. I can already tell though, this is a movie that would only be good for a couple of views, and any sequel has no chance whatsoever."

It was billed as a ""reboot"" of the franchise, which led me to believe that it would be faithful to the spirit of the 1954 original; instead, it was much more like those cheesy Godzilla films of the 1960s and '70s. Instead of being a menace to humanity, Godzilla was a heroic figure, saving us from other big monsters, and all the humans cheer for him as he returns to the sea at the end. All that was missing was Godzooky.<br/><br/>If you enjoy those goofball Godzilla-versus-(blank) movies, you'll love this film. If you prefer the classic Gojira, however, don't bother; you're better off with the 1998 movie, which at least got the concept right."
"georgexu149","4","5","11","18 May 2014"," Clumsy and oafish, just like the monsters
","I kind of alternate between thinking that 4/10 is too harsh, and thinking it's too generous. On the one hand, it's a monster movie, so you get all the trope of ""what do you expect, it's not supposed to be great"". But it was obviously supposed to be great. That's what all the money on special effects was supposed to do - make it great. And it didn't.<br/><br/>The movie is like one of those dreams, where while you're in the movie theatre everything almost kind of makes sense, but once you actually think about it, the whole thing falls apart. The difference between Godzilla and a dream is that Godzilla is falling apart right as it's happening.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, the special effects are the only redeeming feature about the whole movie, and I can't say that even this was something exceptional. Just kind of par for the course of what we would expect from an action movie these days. The clichéd wanton destruction, the clichéd closeup shots of the looks of wonder and surprise before something appropriately SFX-ey happens, etc. My friend, who went to see it with me, compared it to a Michael Bay film, and I think the comparison is very apropos.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was worse. The acting wasn't too bad, but the plot was a complete shambles, and the music was a mess. Like, as far as the music was concerned the movie could have ended after 10 minutes, because that was the climax of the music, and nothing really topped that again. The rest of the music was just clumsy. There was no emotional subtlety, and the music fit the movie only in that like the monsters, it was supposed to crush you(r eardrums) underfoot). I don't normally notice things like the music because it's not something you're supposed to notice if it's done well, but this was just jarring. It was like being hit in the eardrums with a sledgehammer whenever the director wanted you to know that something was going to happen.<br/><br/>The story wasn't much better. It's a monster movie, who cares why the monsters are there. The fact of the matter is they are. Yet this movie spent way too long building a back-story for why there was a monster at all, and in the end it didn't even answer any questions. It was a complete waste of about a fifth of the movie, and I felt it was there just to fill in time. More Godzilla and more MUTO would have been much more satisfying than another 10 minutes of mediocre acting, horrible music, and a story with clumsy emotional ties that weren't even relevant. The whole thing about Godzilla being a force of nature was clumsily done, the way it introduced the different monsters was really confusing, and I really don't understand why in the middle of San Francisco, conveniently right underneath where the female had her eggs, there would be a gas pipeline with a valve in the convenient place and completely undamaged despite all the debris and destruction literally 3 feet away. That coincidence boggles the mind, and it felt to me like a deus ex machina because nobody could think of any other way for the (human) protagonist to be a hero and destroy all the bad monster babies.<br/><br/>The themes and symbols in the movie were very clumsily done. The only redeeming feature about the movie in this regard was that at least it wasn't in Manhattan. Otherwise you have the same old trope about the American government hiding something from the people, the role of America as the world's natural leaders in everything, etc. etc. The bit at the end when Godzilla retreats into the sea was particularly saddening. Throughout the entire movie it had depicted the monsters' movements as terrifying and unknown, but after the final battle (as it were) Godzilla is suddenly portrayed (through the really unsubtle music and camera-work) as being San Francisco's saviour - even though if you were there on the ground, or even observing the situation from afar, Godzilla could have just as easily destroyed the whole of San Francisco, and nothing the Americans had could have stopped it.<br/><br/>Finally, the science and reality-testing. I don't get how Godzilla is supposed to ""speed up"" to 33 knots near San Francisco, but it still manages to traverse the entire Pacific Ocean, thousands of nautical miles, in a reasonable amount of time. At the very least it would have taken several days, and taken much longer than the MUTO flying across the same ocean. Not to mention the whole gobbledegook about ""absorbing radiation"" and that causing previously irradiated areas to become ""clean"" again. Sorry, but that's not how ionising radiation works. And that person dying by going into ""a-fib""? Yeah, right. Tell me more about how you listened to your science/medical advisors - if you even had any.<br/><br/>TL: DR - the directors try their hardest to bludgeon you over the head with, well, everything, but despite that, they still fail to convey a lot of the important stuff.<br/><br/>Don't see it."
"maslichgabe","4","5","11","17 May 2014"," Huge Monster Movie that Doesn't Live up to the Trailers
","First of all, the CGI is incredible. Every explosion and collapse of a building is great. That was the second best thing about the movie. The best thing was Bryan Cranston's story and acting, which was SO stupid to have him killed early. He was interesting and emotional, everything Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't. Aaron was okay, but Cranston was really the reason why the beginning of the movie was so great. In fact, the beginning 20 mins are the best part of the movie. Now, for the bad parts. The M.U.T.O.s made me want to leave the theater. They ruined everything for me. It was almost like they replaced Godzilla with the MUTOs which really bothered me. Next, I wanted to see Godzilla be the Destroyer of Worlds, like his was in the 1954 original, but guess what? He was the SAVIOR of earth? What the crap? I walked into the theater thinking it would be ruthless Godzilla vs the humans, but I got a sympathetic Godzilla vs 2 annoying other creatures. Next, the skipped so many good action scenes. When one MUTO was going to wreck Las Vegas, they cut to people talking. When Godzilla was about to fight a MUTO in Hawaii, they cut to people talking. When Godzilla was about to fight the MUTO again in San Francisco in the rain, they cut to people talking. I wanted to see more destruction of cities, not wait till the last 30 minutes for 3 monsters to battle it out in pitch black! Lastly, so many things were unrealistic. Lots of military equipment are made to block EMPs, that nuke should have killed Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the helicopter, etc. Overall, I just wanted to see Godzilla in his 1954 glory; destroying earth while the humans ran in peril. THAT would have been awesome. However, they choose to make him EMPATHETIC and save the earth. If they make a second one, I'm not seeing it."
"burkhartonline","6","5","11","17 May 2014"," Good, but not great
","It was more about the people than Godzilla. Acting was pretty good and the plot was acceptable. Effects were great and there is plenty of action and drama. But not nearly enough monster action. It does at least avoid the silliness that ruined many of the past movies. No ""boulder volley ball"" or ""monster kung fu"" in this one.<br/><br/>And since they were doing a CGI Godzilla, why make him obese? Seriously, he was fatter than the rubber suit version. I prefer the classic Godzilla over the ""Iguana"" from 1998, but they had a chance to make him look better and they absolutely did not. And their presentation when he finally uses his nuke breath was out and out lame.<br/><br/>My son and I arranged for an extra day off work to see it. We were pumped and excited after watching the trailers. We left the cinema a bit disappointed. The movie does not come close to the hype leading up to its release. Frankly, ""Godzilla 2000"" was a better movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If you watch it, just expect ""another Godzilla movie."" That's all it is. If you expect it to be special, you'll be disappointed."
"chimera-4","5","5","11","16 May 2014"," Boring and Frustrating
","I really wanted to like this after the travesty of the 1998 reboot and while Gareth Edwards' other flick Monsters was a good solid effort with good human drama this falls short on a number of levels the most unforgiving being that it's just plain boring. The reason for this I think is that besides the opening centered on Bryan Cranston's character and situation you really don't care about anyone else in this movie and it takes toooo long to kick off.<br/><br/>Even Godzilla who shows up fully far too late in the game after a series of frustrating near and minor reveals (one of which literally has Edwards shut the door on what had built up to be the kicking off of the main event, teased with a split second of monster on monster action before shutting us out)just seems like a giant punchbag/wrecking ball for the other monsters and there just isn't enough of him or enough characterisation to make us give a sh*t. He turns up out of nowhere for no good reason and then just disappears like nothings happened at the end.<br/><br/>In my opinion the painfully slow burn hurts this. I mean it's not like we don't know what Godzilla looks like from either the myriad other movies before it or even from the trailer for this one. Lets face it if you go to see a Godzilla movie you want lots of monsters a$$kicking each other to kingdom come and breaking sh*t all over (admittedly there IS plenty of destruction) you don't want to have to wait three quarters of the movie to see it. <br/><br/>On the acting front after the strong drama at the beginning the young lead just can't compete with Cranston and you feel that black hole throughout the rest of the movie. You initially feel like you might actually be getting A list performances but that ends quickly and you're left with exposition and flunked by the book emotional beats.<br/><br/>On the plus side Godzilla himself looks phenomenal and the FX are awesome as are the fight scenes but overall I think this movie is a disappointment."

","GODZILLA (2014) *** Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, Richard T. Jones, Victor Rasuk, Carson Bolde, CJ Adams. The 20th Century King of The Monsters gets a 21st Century reboot with the gigantic lizard reawakened along with some other surprises in filmmaker Gareth Edwards frequently rewarding, but long-winded reimagining. While its blue-chip cast is largely wasted (sorry Cranston, Hawkins and Binoche), and in spite of its far-too-long-in-expository chatty screenplay by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham, Edwards manages the monster mash in the final act to be relatively worthy of its ticket price in IMAX 3-D (the only way to see it). The CGI holds up even if there are echoes of CLOVERFIELD's creature design and Edwards' reliance in playing peek-a-boo like he did in his fairly deceptive MONSTERS. While it eschews the ethos of a man-in-a-rubber suit demolishing a miniature set it still echoes the classic film's strong Atomic age messing with Mother Nature underpinnings."
"gene108-2-965014","8","5","11","16 May 2014"," Very well done despite plot holes
","A very well done Godzilla movie, despite several plot holes that did not irritate me enough to still sit back and enjoy the show. The plot holes were big enough to make me not give it a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>A few of issues that irked me: (1) the shortest way from Point A to Point B maybe a straight line, but it will not be the easiest way, if you are going through a fight-to-the-death between Godzilla and a couple of MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and (2) why is it in movies about San Francisco that when people evacuate they just HAVE TO GO TO SAUSALITO? <br/><br/>I've only been to the Bay Area a couple of times and the Golden Gate area once, but once was enough for someone to point out that the Golden Gate Bridge connects SF with Sausalito. Ever since that experience, I cannot look at evacuations scenes on the GGB the same way. <br/><br/>(3) I think the police and city planners would have evacuation routes planned out and people would have been evacuated sooner. We have experience with this sort of thing with regards to hurricanes. (4) Nuclear fall out is still a thing to be worried about for populated areas 20 miles away from several megatons going boom and if you are less than 20 miles out, it is more of a concern.<br/><br/>For those complaining that there are not enough fight scenes between Godzilla and MUTO's, I think that is both the appeal and agony of Godzilla movies. You really want to see the monsters fight, but the film never seems to give you enough. It is how Godzilla movies have been done for 60 years and this movie delivers like its Toho studio predecessors in this regard. It is one of the defining attributes of the Godzilla genre. <br/><br/>Overall the movie strikes a good balance between devastation (we're paying to see the monsters flatten stuff), the fear and helplessness of being stuck in a fight between forces greater than you and not driving it home to the point you curl up in the fetal position at the loss of life.<br/><br/>I think this is one reason the human characters are not as three-dimensional as they could be. You just cannot have deep characters people connect with on an emotional level and wipe out a major U.S. city and still have people leaving the theater without crying.<br/><br/>So far this is the best big-budget Godzilla movie to date."
"reifmandds","1","11","31","16 May 2014"," Worst film I've seen in a long, long time.
","A correction. If you are 15 and under, its a terrific movie. Otherwise, save your money, as you'll feel like walking out. Although this low-budget movie starts off OK, and yes, the special effects are pretty good (although the x-man/spider-man effects were better IMHO), the movie drags on and drags on. Yawn! When Godzilla wants to 'help' humanity by killing off the pair of monstrous birdies, they actually have a sergeant tell his troops to 'hold your fire' so the birds can make it to their nest. <br/><br/>Never mind that the birds are destroying half of Las Vegas, Honolulu, San Francisco, and annihilating thousands of innocent bystanders, but hey, ya can't fight them! Politically incorrect to use ordinance on birds, I suppose.<br/><br/>I know tech always takes a leap out of the window in 'shoot 'em up movies', which is fine- so long as the effects are good. But the special effects team must have had a laughingly hearty field day to show dozens of jets and planes just falling out of the sky due to the EMP by the birds on them. Never mind there are mechanical over-rides to EMP by the military and commercial aircraft, the toy planes just crash 'n burn into the Pacific ocean like so many mosquito's swapped from the sky. It just looked too darn phony. They sure could have done a much better job with EMP special effects, but then again, I'm not a producer.<br/><br/>Finally, I guess Hollywood likes to show how ineffectual our military is, because when they had the fire-breathing Godzilla use that 'hot breath' to kill off one of the birds, it could have saved thousands of lives (and property, and a couple of cities) by just one private firing a couple of air to surface missiles down their gullet, into their soft underbelly, their eyes, whatever. But obviously, not that romantic. <br/><br/>Better to think that humanity is close to extinction because our military for some reason can't shoot some prehistoric birds down. Like I said, I love 'shoot em up' movies as much as the next, but the schtick is so over the top and with such erratic special effects, that if you're not a teenager, as they say, 'fahget it'!"
"gilgongo1980","3","2","3","19 November 2019"," 2 hours of pure boredom
","The movie plays when Godzilla occurs always in the rain and in the dark, so that you could see little. Other films like ""Jurassic World (2015)"" have shown that you can make good and decent CGI in daylight. Why does the action take place only in rain and in darkness? Did not the budget suffice?
It is also often shot, but that is a minor matter. Because a gigantic cockroach threatens the city and Godzilla fights against these and for the people. During the film, I could have fallen asleep, after the movie, my tiredness disappeared again. That speaks well against this movie."

","The last hour hour or so of ""Godzilla"" is quite good. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the movie. The first three quarters of this movie is not so hot. The biggest problem with this movie is that most of the monster stuff takes place at night and you can't really see what's going on. It's annoying. The cast and the acting are okay at best. Bryan Cranston's performance is as bad as his wig. I don't mind stars making a cash grab. They should strike while the iron is hot. But they should at least try to do a good job. Cranston, however, seems to be mailing this one in. He's a real detriment to the movie. Overall, ""Godzilla"" is a mostly forgettable movie.

"mitchell5954","5","2","3","10 February 2019"," Overrated!
","Godzilla 2014 is a big disappointment for me. The film is a decent movie but, in my opinion, not a good Godzilla movie and just a lackluster film in general. There is barely any Godzilla in the film and instead focuses mostly on the human point-of-view. That is not necessarily a bad approach except that the human characters are not that interesting. When we see Godzilla and the other monsters wreak havoc it is awesome and there is some good action and great effects. However, when we finally see Godzilla wreak havoc and fighting the other creatures it is short-lived until the very end. Plus, the film is very padded out.<br/><br/>The film is not god-awful. There are a lot of things that the film does very well. The effects are amazing. This is probably the best looking Godzilla movie so far. The movie, especially at the end fight has a very grand and epic feel to it. Everything just feels so huge and when the action scenes happen they are epic from the great effects, to the action, to the great set pieces. This must be an amazing film to see in 3D. I did not see it in 3D though.<br/><br/>I also really like the design of Godzilla as well as the other monsters. Of all the films I have seen I think this one has my favorite design of Godzilla. Fans of the original Godzilla from Japan will be happy to know that this film stays true to the original film and lore right down to Godzilla's look. A good chunk of the film also takes place in Japan. For me personally, I do not care about that as much.<br/><br/>Unlike most people I was introduced to Godzilla through the 1998 film and grew up on that, so I will always like and look to that movie first. I know I am in the minority but I enjoy the 1998 Godzilla movie. Honestly, I even like that film more than this film. I am not asking for anyone to agree but that's how I feel. I like the characters more, I like the action scenes more (though they did not feel as epic), and I like that Godzilla was used much more. The film felt a lot more like a Godzilla movie because he was in it much more and felt like a more realized character. I actually felt for Godzilla in the 1998 film, while in this one it was hard to get invested in Godzilla because we do not see him enough.<br/><br/>One of the big issues I have with the film is that we barely see any Godzilla. The most we see of him is his spikes sticking out of the water. We do not see Godzilla in his full glory until near the end. We see the other monsters more and even then not much. When Godzilla or the other creatures wreck a city when he is fighting the other creatures we only see a little bit of it then it cuts away and then you see the end result until the end fight, which bugged me. When we see the monsters wreaking havoc it looks amazing, so I wish I could have seen more of it. When the trailers hinted that other monsters besides Godzilla would be in the film I was expecting something along the lines of Pacific Rim with lots of monster action, but that is not what we get. I do not want to hear people say: ""A movie with lots of monster action is not realistic."" This is a movie that has giant monsters. What is realistic about that? What I like about the 1998 film is that they have fun with the monster.<br/><br/>The entire film is from the perspective of the humans which is not always bad but it is in this case. The human characters are not interesting enough to keep me invested for the entire film. The characters in the 1998 film, whether you like them or not, have more personality and are more memorable than the people in this. The only interesting character in the film is Brian Cranston's character. When he was there I was more invested and I thought he was going to be the lead considering he was marketed as the main character in the trailers. However he is killed off halfway through the film and the lead role shifts to his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and there is nothing to this guy. He is not interesting and has only one expression on his face throughout the entire film. He just looks very bored even when everything is coming down around him. The other characters are extremely forgettable, if you can even call them characters. The only other somewhat decent character is Dr. Ishiro played by Ken Watanabe. However, most of his screen time consists of him standing around not doing anything so it does not matter.<br/><br/>Overall, Godzilla 2014 is sadly an underwhelming movie in my opinion. It can be considered a good or even great movie to fans of the original Godzilla. For me it was a disappointment. There are things the film does well or even amazingly well. I guess I was expecting a somewhat different film then what we got. You don't have to think that way though. I think many people will enjoy the film. Many people who have seen it did enjoy it."

","I like sci-fi, and enjoy suspending reality for a couple hours. Having said that, there still needs to be a modicum of believability in a film. Either those responsible for this film are totally clueless, or more likely just didn't give a rip. I will not bother listing all the issues in the movie, just see the goofs section. There were a couple of things that jumped out at me repeatedly though. 1) for some reason, the main character (a navy lieutenant), wasn't required to be at work or report in (I suppose maybe he was on leave). At any rate, he must've been quite the lieutenant as he was able to just join up with whatever military unit he happened to come across in his travels. 2) apparently the special effects folks struggle with the concepts of scale and distance...constantly. I truly hate to think it was decided that the movie-going public would be so overwhelmed by the awesome special effects that they wouldn't notice all the plot holes and poor research, but that's kind of what we have to assume."
"JIMm_wordplay","8","2","3","10 March 2017"," This film pits Godzilla against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity's scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence.
","Gareth Edward's version of ""Godzilla"" is an honorable monster- invasion film of all sorts. It is very different from Tristar's 1998 film of the same title where its monster loves to eat fish and wreaks havoc out of pointlessness which is so cheesy and laughable in a very bad way. Edward's version has a more tolerable reasoning. And it was improved even more by its impressive cinematography, wise and humble usage of special effects and the CGI creation of Godzilla, which looks almost completely faithful to the 1954 original.<br/><br/>I am somehow enjoying the form of this film. The action is bigger when it involves humans. As much as possible, when the monsters fight, it limits itself to be action-packed by setting the camera work in the human perspective and sometimes at an even more distant range. It's not that the monster action isn't happening. It's definitely there and special effects are used but its style tries to make its audience be a part of the scene and also to tranquilize its nature to succumb in clichéd action sequences.<br/><br/>I actually prefer it that way. Comparing this to last year's ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Godzilla"" is definitely more exciting. Why? Because ""Pacific Rim"" is fully drowned in monster mayhem and uproarious action so mindless it will make you yawn or scratch your heads. It gives a very detached, easily weary effect (although its other elements like its human drama and stunning visuals made it irresistible). In ""Godzilla"" however, the lesser focus or up-close look on the monster action gives more immense anticipation whether it happens or not.<br/><br/>The movie is also impressive on not showing its monster feature so easily. Patience definitely builds excitement as in Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws."" It slowly introduces Godzilla, starting with the body parts first in creeping silence. But when it finally show Godzilla's full image and roars so mightily, the scene easily becomes iconic. That was such an epic entrance. And it doesn't end there. It is filled with so many remarkable images of Godzilla. The wide shots of this monster are considered the best as it shows its entire scale while enamored by the subtle palette of its canvas.<br/><br/>Godzilla is the main star of this picture although it has less of him. He roars so great and his fiery breath dominates the film with inexplicable power. Honestly, I think no one could have it the other way around.<br/><br/>To generalize it all, ""Godzilla"" is an epic monster-invasion picture that triumphs greatly because of valuing its CGI and special effects by utilizing it more in achieving an artistic statement and immersive quality than just exhibiting heavy cataclysmic action. It effects are into impressive visuals that emits beautiful imagery and the cinematography anchored it with competence.<br/><br/>Recreating Godzilla in a rare, perfect form is definitely something. But without having an idea on picking elements to collaborate it with,it would be almost like burying this iconic monster into the deepest trench of the ocean. I'm glad that this version has met some wise decisions. It wasn't for everyone but at least it shows utmost respect."

On the downside all the characters are kinda flat and underdeveloped especially from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is the main hero dude.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston might be the exception, but he (consciously?) overacts his role as Joe the grieving father/scientist/Godzilla conspiracy theorist. There is a decent back story set up for him though. Elizabeth Olsen is in the wife/mother role and this could have been done by anyone. Ken Watanabe also very flat, a grumpy sort of non character. They all take it seriously though, and this is an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The visuals are beautifully done and I enjoyed the story with Godzilla emerging from hibernation to battle winged creatures called Motos, threatening humanity. I also liked the new spin put on Godzilla where he is the good monster, helping to save civilization and bus loads of children from the evil, nuclear loving, ever mating Motos. Wasn't too sure about the spin put on history regarding Hiroshima etc -changing history- but decided to just let that go.<br/><br/>Lots of mayhem and destruction, as cities are leveled (which is always fun to watch), some excellent battle scenes with colossal destruction from the creatures, lots of globe trotting through Japan (Vancouver), Hawaii, Las Vegas, and San Francisco.

"pyrocitor","5","2","3","17 December 2015"," ""And also featuring Godzilla!""
","Let's be honest: you love Godzilla. Who wouldn't? And even if you were one of the few who didn't quite love Gareth Edwards' Monsters (not monster-y enough...?), you'd find it hard to deny its impeccable technical mastery and surreal beauty. So, how could the twain meeting, not unlike a couple of frisky extraterrestrials, not make for a modern monstrous masterpiece - the 'Christopher Nolan of giant monster movies', as the sepia-toned poster screamed? <br/><br/>Well, quite easily, apparently. It was tacitly assumed that Edwards would retain Monsters' artistic grit but substantially ratchet up the pace, mayhem and fun in a fashion befitting Godzilla. Instead, Edwards' crack at Big G is a misguided, soulless, plodding, jingoistic, reluctant blockbuster so hell-bent on realism (and there's a pretty tenuous grasp on that here as well) that it squashes virtually all the giant fun they set out for. <br/><br/>The film starts strong: a brief surge of tension with a harrowing radioactive meltdown, followed by a blur of cryptic exposition, with the words 'prehistoric mega-predator' uttered a lot, with a cheeky potshot at the 1998 monstrosity to boot. It's all a bit clumsy, but eerily fun, and enough to pique excitement. This is a Godzilla movie! This dreary start is only the calm before the storm. But Edwards carries on, scene after scene of barely lit scientific subterfuge, and it lags enough for questions to start bubbling: how does Ken Watanabe's mysterious scientist know this storied palaeontological history? Surely it's not just because ""he looks wise and Japanese""...<br/><br/>But that's okay, because the fun really kicks off when we... get to spend lots of quality time with Aaron Taylor-Johnson sleeping his way through the prestigious role of 'abrasively bland military meathead'. Thrill as he...suppresses sentiment and forces awkward chemistry with his wife and kid, and, um, sulks through unresolved tension with his estranged father. Whee. But hey - Edwards has bagged the beloved Bryan Cranston. Now the fun starts, as his intrepid scientist...grimaces and yells trailer stingers for 25 minutes before Edwards pulls a Psycho and kills him off for forced dramatic effect, right when he was becoming interesting?! Oh no. Oh hell no. <br/><br/>Oh yes. Gasp as this mega-blockbuster lumbers along, agonizingly slowly, indecisively flitting back and forth between a bevy of quality actors (hello David Strathairn and Sally Hawkins!) playing virtually nameless, one-dimensional characters, expressionlessly mumbling their dialogue - generally variants of ""oh no!"" - as if off cue cards. Marvel at the excruciatingly long cutscenes of military jingoism, where nameless men in camouflage frown a lot, and sit around aimlessly. Rah. But it's all worthwhile, as, roughly four hours into the film, we have our first monster sighting! At long last, it's... ""Muto""? What the hell is that? Yup - our main playmates for the toy soldiers are two generic Cloverfield rip-offs, who squawk and flap around whimsically as scientists grimly ponder their motivations. And, yup, we get to watch them bang too. And, it's...surprisingly boring. Yikes.<br/><br/>But behold! After all this agony, there he is - Godzilla! The king of monsters! Look at him in all of his awe-inspiring glo- hey! Get those needless foreground set pieces out of the way! Tilt that camera up! Gareth. Buddy. How can you be this cruel. <br/><br/>You get the idea. 'Realism', to Edwards, means the titular character cameoing in his own movie (less than fifteen minutes of screen time!!). Instead, swathes of hilariously uninteresting grunts shuffle back and forth, each time coming precariously close to a monster action setpiece that would probably be tremendously fun if Edwards showed it, instead of playfully/sadistically obscuring most, aping a horror trope that became tiresome eight years ago. But no - fun is nowhere near gritty enough for the realism on display here. Realism - like Taylor-Johnson's butthead popping up at each successive monster sighting through rampant coincidence to lend 'human scope' to the carnage (it doesn't). Or his dreary wife (poor Elizabeth Olsen tries, but deserves much better) making absurdly nonsensical decisions, including child abandonment, to require saving and venerate his manliness. But let's not forget Watanabe, whose performance consists of staring, bug-eyed and slack-jawed, into the distance. Over. And over. And over. Watanabe either has a shaky grasp on how PTSD works, or, breaking the fourth wall, is sharing his reflective horror at the disgrace unfolding around him. I prefer the latter. Let's be honest: he's really just here to say ""Let them fight!"" anyway. <br/><br/>And when Edwards reluctantly, fleetingly, indulges, it's...yeah, okay, it's pretty darn cool. Edwards still has an undeniable penchant for atmosphere and set design, and, aesthetically, he's made another downright beautiful film (when the perennial sepia murk clears away enough to see it). Alexandre Desplat's bombastically roaring musical score breathes as much radioactive fire into the proceedings as possible, but he's got his work cut out for him. And Big G himself is a visual triumph, all scales and sinews heart-poundingly rendered, and it's stupendously fun watching him show the Mutos who's boss. Heck - he's such fun I'd even watch a whole film about him! Someone should give that a whirl sometime. <br/><br/>Despite all of these abundantly warranted criticisms, there's a rather excellent film lurking in Godzilla's ponderous belly. It's about twelve minutes long, and consists of all of the time he's on screen. Thanks to the power of YouTube or blu-ray track skipping, you too can witness this cinematic marvel - and cast aside the bloated, sludgy carcass weighing it down. Otherwise (and I never thought I'd say this), if you're hell-bent on an English language Godzilla, there's that 'we do not speak of it' one from the 90s starring Matthew Broderick the worm guy and half the cast of the Simpsons. It's trashier and sillier, but at least more fun, and - tragically - aesthetics aside, there's not much of a jump of quality. There. I said it. Come at me, Godzookys! <br/><br/>-5/10"

","Godzilla (org. ""Gojira"" in Japanese, which gets corrupted to Godzilla in English by the untrained ear) makes a reappearance as a truly cosmopolitan monster, and not just the bane of Tokyo. I've sure the Japanese are relieved not having their capital city destroyed yet again.<br/><br/>The effects are very good, and this is of course what holds the movie up - with any disaster or monster movie, disbelief must be suspected to enjoy the movie. That being said there are some scenes that are not just dubious and silly, but outright stupid (had me rolling my eyes a couple of times), in various ways, not just what is possible, but what is meaningful or makes military sense. Seriously, do the soldiers really think that a measly assault rifle will do anything whatsoever against a monster the size of a skyscraper?<br/><br/>The acting is overall fair, but superficial, and handicapped by that the scriptwriters didn't do any character development or meaningful interaction with each other. No significant show of emotion is on the big screen, which makes the human part completely forgettable (apart from the opening of the movie, but that stands alone).<br/><br/>Worst of all is Ken Watanabe's part - which is more that of a prop than an actor. He spends a lot of his time just standing around, looking dumbfounded, and not saying a word. Why did the scriptwriters waste his talent such? Why did he agree to taking this role in the first place? Didn't he read the script? The movie wouldn't have lost much if the humans were cut out. Annoyingly, the most we see of the human race here is the brave American military (smirk).<br/><br/>Overall, this is quite watchable for your typical movie night, but also quite forgettable. Only re-watchable for fans of 'ol 'zilla."

","I was really excited to see this movie and it was a good build up but honestly I was a bit disappointed by it. It was not exciting, it did not keep me on the edge of my seat. I actually stopped it about half way through because I wasn't interested in it anymore. One of the only reasons I gave it a 6 was because the film looked great and the animations of Godzilla were great and I loved Bryan Cranston being in it since I love Breaking Bad. It think I was being generous giving it a 6. Other than Bryan Cranston the acting was a bit cheesy and made me laugh at some points. The movie never really pulled me in. I found myself reaching for the remote to change to a different movie after the first quarter of the movie. It was kind of boring and nothing really exciting happened. Even if something happened at the very end that was exiting it wasn't good enough to keep me watching it that long.

They were loud and silly movies for the most part, but I fell in love with the King Of Monsters and it was for that reason I was excited to see what they would do with a new movie, especially one without Matthew Broderick. So how did Gareth Edwards and company do? Pretty darn well. Godzilla is a terrific looking movie with some incredibly breath taking scenes, especially the halo jump. The effects on Godzilla himself and the Mutos is flawless, He has never looked better, in fact, then main complaint everyone has is that they do not see enough of him, and I have to agree. There was a little too much human drama, and even my daughter who is ten was surprised at the small role that Bryan Cranston played, Although Ken Watanabe was terrific as the voice of reason, ""Let Them Fight!"".

"brando647","7","2","3","20 February 2015"," Top Notch Monster Effects with a Wooden Protagonist
","When the new GODZILLA had hit theaters in 2014, there was an enormous amount of hatred spewed online about how horrible it was. People were complaining in droves about the wooden acting and the fact that the movie's namesake barely appeared in the film at all. Some of these complaints are perfectly legit, but othersin my opinionnot so much. Before GODZILLA was released, I did a bit of homework. Having never actually seen a Godzilla film before but interested in this new film, I watched the original 1954 film (as well as the 1956 American version) and four different Toho films from the later collection. Maybe it's because I put way more thought into it than I should've, but I didn't hate GODZILLA and each subsequent viewing made it more and more entertaining. The movie opens in the late 90's, when a mining crew stumbled across a couple giant eggs of unknown origin in an underground chamber. Years later, a creature emerges from the within and busts out of the research facility that had contained it. It carves a path of destruction through Japan and then across the Pacific to the western coast of the United States where it intends to mate with another MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism) that has hatched from a similar egg that had been dumped into storage in Nevada. Mankind has only one hope to stop these creatures: Godzilla. The king of monsters awakens and beelines for California where it will do battle with the MUTOsbut can man trust he won't turn his destructive power on them next?<br/><br/>I'm going to start by defending this movie. For all the people who complain that Godzilla doesn't get much screen time or that his first couple battles against the MUTOs occur off screen, you went into this movie with the wrong expectations. Considering director Gareth Edwards was most likely brought on based on the strengths of his movie MONSTERS which, as I understand (I haven't seen it), tells the story of a giant monster attack form the perspective of the humans on the ground and doesn't actually feature much of the beast. Then, if you go back and watch the original GOJIRA, Godzilla doesn't feature much until the final march into Tokyo. Until the end, Godzilla is seen in bits and piecesa glimpse of his head towering over a hill, his foot coming down into a home, etc. So I personally understand Edwards' decision to give Godzilla minimal screen time (and even that's unfairwe see plenty of him) and saving the on-screen battle for the very end. He's building tension. If he'd given us what we want right away, what interest would we have had in staying through to the end? The creature design on Godzilla is fantastic. He's got the classic design brought to life with seamless CG with a few updates to make him a little more menacing. I'm not as keen on the look of the MUTOs. That would be a complaint of mine. With all the other monsters already populating Toho's collection, why go with an original creation? And why go with a design that feels too familiar to what we've seen in CLOVERFIELD or PACIFIC RIM? While I'm on the topic of the MUTOs, why would they have developed an EMP defense? From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability to produce an electromagnetic pulse would've only been useful in the last hundred years. These creatures have been around for millennia. It's useful from a storytelling perspective (keeps the humans helpless around them) but makes no sense otherwise.<br/><br/>So, while I can forgive Edwards for not spoiling us with an abundance of creature battles, I can't forgive him for his casting and direction. GODZILLA puts us in the perspective of Ford Brody, an explosives expert with the American military played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I know Taylor-Johnson has got skill. He was great in KICK- ASS and NOWHERE BOY. But here, he's the most wooden, uninteresting character I have seen in a film in a long, long time. He never quite emotes, speaking all his lines very quietly without much of any sort of inflection. I think the only emotion he displayed the entire time was mild irritation. He was dull and, since he's our ""main character"", every sequence that wasn't Godzilla or MUTOs tearing through society suffered. Elizabeth Olsen, another talented young star, is similarly wasted on the other end of the spectrum. She spends most of the time crying or panicking. If we were going to spend an entire movie following a character through this fantastical crisis, it should've been Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) or Ford's father Joe (Bryan Cranston). Oh, and don't expect much Joe. Despite being prominently displayed in pretty much every trailer or TV spot, Cranston actually has less screen time than Godzilla. Not cool, Warner/Legendary. Not cool. <br/><br/>GODZILLA is a nice blend of elements from both the original, more subtle GOJIRA and the city-smashing monster battles of Toho's later films. It's flawed and its human characters are its weakest bit. But you can't argue with the presentation of Japan's most famous monsterthe design and CG are amazing and his final battle with the MUTOs, while short, is awesome. I might be in the minority but I didn't hate this movie and I find I enjoy it a little more each time I watch it. Manage your expectations and you should find something to enjoy about the 2014 resurrection of the legend: GODZILLA."

","The Godzilla remake is here, and, well... Let's just say it wasn't worthy of my money, which is sad, because I was hopeful for this movie...<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston stars as Joe Brody, a scientist who discovers the existence of Godzilla, as usual they don't believe in him, 15 years pass and is now up to his son Ford Brody as played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson to protect his family in a monster breakout.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Max Borenstein is, without a doubt, the problem with this movie, the movie is too long for it's own sake, and there is too little of Godzilla, he appears in the climax, and by then you're already bored of the movie, trying to build some emotion in Ford's character, but it fails completely on the degree that I was falling asleep...<br/><br/>To give the movie credit, the ending battle scene is indeed really awesome, but was it wasn't worth watching it all the way to it."
"suite92","7","2","3","13 February 2015"," Godzilla saves humanity from the mutos in an 8 minute appearance.
","Setup and Plot<br/><br/>In the opening sequence, Joe Brody, his wife Sandra and son Ford are in Japan. Joe and Sandra work at a project that aims to contain some unexplained phenomena involving huge amounts of energy and a partially buried large object. The object turns out to be living, breaks much of the containment apparatus, and causes widespread tragedy. A heavier blanket of secrecy is applied.<br/><br/>Jump forward to the present. Ford is grown up, is in the US armed services, and has a wife Elle and son Sam in San Francisco. Ford gets a call from Joe, then goes to Japan to get him out of jail. While Ford helps out Joe, the object (a 'muto') revives, breaks free this time, and flies away, leaving even more destruction and death than in years before.<br/><br/>A second, larger muto awakens in Nevada. The two mutos are tracked by the US Navy, which is now actively involved. The mutos' activity awakens Godzilla from his long slumber in the Pacific.<br/><br/>Ford and Dr. Serizawa are drawn into the military's quest to contain the mutos. Elle and Sam are at risk as the three giants converge on San Francisco.<br/><br/>Observations<br/><br/>True to tradition in Godzilla movies, human activity is depicted as futile. Most human efforts against giant monsters have no noticeable effect. The rest of our efforts catalyse the monsters to rain down more destruction on human cities and military personnel.<br/><br/>In a few of the many Godzilla films I have seen, a child is rescued, or a trapped helpless person is released. But for each such action, thousands of human lives are lost, and tens of billions of dollars of real estate value are zeroed out. The contrast accentuates the helplessness of the human race against forces it cannot control and never will control.<br/><br/>In a slight departure from what I'm used to in the Godzilla universe, a human being does something that will make the survival of the human race more likely. Watch the film; you can't miss it.<br/><br/>Godzilla causes a huge amount of property damage and loss of life, though not nearly as much as the mutos cause. The case could be made that Godzilla in this film, as in many others, is indifferent to the fate of the human race. He does in the mutos in order to get back to his snooze beneath the Pacific.<br/><br/>Scores<br/><br/>Cinematography: 8/10 Some of the SFX were cheesy, but most were fabulous.<br/><br/>Sound: 7/10 Few complaints. I could hear the dialog. The music was not too irritating.<br/><br/>Acting: 6/10 Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, and Sally Hawkins were fine in their limited roles. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance was both boring (beginning) and believably heroic (toward the end), so I ended up liking him.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 6/10 The director stayed true to the franchise, but with updated SFX and a few other adjustments. The holes in the plot, though, seemed endless."
"r_massey","4","2","3","28 January 2015"," Bland
","This new adaptation of ""Godzilla"" seemed to be the perfect opportunity for rekindling an interest in the monster and presenting him a new light. While the film does successfully showcase that Godzilla can be treated as a protagonist, it seems very absurd that a population would come to that conclusion after the amount of destruction caused by the monsters.<br/><br/>I was aware of Godzilla's little screen time before viewing the film but was disappointed with the MUTOs having been given the spotlight, leaving Godzilla as an inevitable plot device for getting rid of the 'evil' monsters, making the majority of the militaristic aspects of the film pretty pointless, even when we are explicitly told that Godzilla will have to defeat the MUTOs somewhere in the second act and the military act regardless; we have no interest in their actions following this point.<br/><br/>The action and tension quickly wears off and becomes dull following the first act and all sense of mystery and suspense is stripped away at the clear sights of the MUTOs terrorising cities via TV broadcasts. The visuals and CGI are impressive but as previously mentioned, the MUTOs appear to be given more screen time which means we are unable to fully appreciate the level of detail put into Godzilla, whose design is much more meticulous than that of the Cloverfield-esque monsters.<br/><br/>What would have been a great, chilling scene in the third act, when soldiers free fall into the barren and devastated city at night, is diminished by the fact that, again, there is no more mystery regarding the monsters and no tension to be anticipated. The film very easily comes across as bland as it steers away from teasing big reveals and instead opts for the cliché and more explicit shots of the monsters battling it out and the city in ruin but no real evidence of a chaotic atmosphere as most civilians are swept aside, letting the soldiers take the forefront of the narrative.<br/><br/>Cast performances are not at their potential best due to the averagely-written script. There seems to be little drive within the characters, appearing very simple, following explicit orders. Emotional moments are never fully explored as most of this exchange is quickly done and dusted, either in person or over the phone.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" is a tolerable watch (not that I'd recommend it) but you may find yourself disappointed and underwhelmed after the 2 hour viewing. Don't expect a lot other than an average 'monster' movie that fails to present an epic scale, with simple characters and a very stale plot."

","This has to be one of 2014s biggest & best Action/Sci-Fi movies, and it's so good to see a movie like this have it all - decent story, plenty of action, and superb visuals. Also, this is NOT a remake/sequel to the decent 1998 movie, and anyone who says it is needs to do a wee bit of research. It's a reboot of the original 1954 Godzilla movie, which actually gets tied-in with this film.<br/><br/>Now, while that '98 film was good, and still is enjoyable, it's just too much along the lines of other Roland Emmerich popcorn movies...masses of CGI & visuals but thin on plot. This version, however, blows that one out the water and while it still is a CGI-fest, at least the story wasn't forgotten about like other CGI-fest movies i.e. Pacific Rim, Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day.<br/><br/>I LOVED Godzilla here and he's an absolute bad-ass, and while he's been kept to the basic original look of the '54 monster, he's been given a 2014 makeover at the same time. I love the look of Godzilla in the '98 version as well, but this version is far superior. The cast all do a bang-up job as well and there isn't one unlikeable character. The only thing is you do struggle to understand what Ken Watanabe - who plays Dr. Ishiro Serizawa - says sometimes, but other than that they all do a great job.<br/><br/>Now, I've read reviews saying this film ""has no action"" and ""was boring"". Seriously?! No action?! There's CONSTANT action throughout the movie so how people can say there's ""no action"" is beyond baffling. I guess the story interrupted their enjoyment too many times. Anyway, the only downsides I had with this film was that it was too dark in some places so was hard to see what was happening - especially towards the end - and I would have liked to have seen Godzilla just a bit more throughout the movie. Those are really the only reasons why I gave this an 8 rating instead of a 9 or possibly a 10, but even still, this is a superb movie.<br/><br/>Ignore the haters and judge it for yourself.

"InMyHonestOpinion","7","2","3","19 January 2015"," Monster movie the way it should be
","Monster movies are great for one reason; what if? Over the years Godzilla the beast of all beasts has gone through some monstrous treatment by movie makers who believe they can tell his story and give it some justice. Godzilla is a character developed by the Japanese he has so far stared in 28 movies and a couple of TV series. Personally Godzilla has always been a favourite; I have always had a love of giant monsters, beasts, and creations. I've absolutely hated a lot of the films that have been made so far of Godzilla so I was really hoping that this version will finally see justice done and deliver something to remember, this explains why it took me so long to give it a viewing, I just couldn't handle another fake, horrible, iguana looking creature 1954, there are nuclear bombs being detonated in the middle of the ocean, loud screams of a giant beast can be heard and we get a slight glimpse of some back scales, seems as though the bombs they are dropping are being dropped to destroy something; something very large. 1999 and we are somewhere over the Philippines, a helicopter hovers over a very large mine a Japanese researcher named Ichiro Serizawa finds out that the men there have discovered a monstrous cavern after a cave collapse, inside the cavern the scientist and his assistant discover a very large skeleton unlike anything they have ever seen. Hanging from the cavern are two what appears to be cocoons, one is hatched and appears to be what has made the cave as it dragged its monstrous size across the land and into the ocean. Joe Brady is in Japan trying frantically to organise a meeting to close down the power plant on the island due to very large seismic activity. While in the nuclear plant another tremor happens and before anyone can do anything about it there is a major breach, disaster strikes in more ways than one as the plant comes crashing down killing thousands. 2014 Joe Brady's son Lt Ford Brody has made it back home to wife and son in San Francisco but now needs to go back to Japan to bail his father out of prison. Joe Brady has been searching for answers ever since the meltdown and will do what needs to be done to find them. He makes it back to the island where the plant was originally only to discover the truth to what the local government has been hiding. Godzilla is a monster film unlike any other, it's a trip back to yesteryear, it is a montage to all things BIG but best of all it's a movie that gets it so right. To say there were things done amazingly well would be an insult. The CGI of the Monsters in this movie is second to none, it is outstanding, and a lot of the times BIG means a horrible mess, there are very few films where the big creatures look as menacing and as beautiful as they should. Unfortunately though there is so much that lets the film down as well, horrible acting, very weak storyline, and very BIG plot holes. Personally I feel the good outweighs the bad but I'm sure thousands will disagree. I can forgive the director and the films continuity where it was missing for the amazing creatures he and his team have created. The acting is extremely underwhelming, you don't care about any one of them, at its core it is a story of finding the lost partner once again. Ford making his way back to San Francisco to be with his wife and child before the creatures destroy the city around them. Lt Ford Brody is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (The Illusionist, Kick Ass) his wife Elle Brody played by Elizabeth Olsen (Oldboy, Kill your Darlings) Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays Joe Brody apparently (reading other reviews) he was great in his role, personally I didn't see anything to make him the star. Also Ken Watanabe (Inception, Batman Begins) as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa and Sally Hawkins (Layer Cake, Blue Jasmine) both deserve a mention for their roles as unforgettable as they were. Godzilla should be seen to be enjoyed, it's not at all a masterpiece of cinematic viewing, but it is a monster of a monster movie and that's all it really needs to be. Personally I was so happy with what I seen on the screen ( really want to say more but don't want to give it away) It blew me away and took me back to my childhood. The director Gareth Edwards I feel did an amazing job with the CGI and special effects just next time I think more care needs to be taken with his stars. There are two sequels being made so lets just wait to see what's next."
"bgtw","6","2","3","8 January 2015"," the monster should always be the star!
","The problem with this movie is similar to many big budget monster movies in that it fails to recognise that the monster is the real star attraction, instead this movie decided to concentrate on the human aspect , it fails miserably as the characters excluding cranston and watanabe aren't appealing in the slightest. In regards to the action it also fails. The monsters in my opinion look incredible and wish there was more of it, unfortunately as soon as it starts to build up it cuts to the humans again and completely kills the tension. I don't hate this movie, it is watchable, but don't watch pacific rim and think you are going to get more of the same, the flip side is if you hated pacific rim you may like this.on another note this movie is leaps and bounds above the previous godzilla film and there are signs the filmmakers are fans of godzilla (atomic breath is awesome)"

","Im bemused at those who give this a 1 star. It really isn't as bad as that, in fact it's very watchable with enough action and dialogue to satisfy most movie goers. All films are easy to criticise, and if I put my mind to it I could do the same here. But could I watch this more than once? Yes, and I have. Is it well acted, yes. Is the story good, well it's OK, not mind blowing, but above average. There has been criticism that Godzilla isn't seen enough. I don't quite understand that as I think they got it just right. It stops it suffering from overkill which I am sure would induce criticism in other ways! So , no, it isn't an Oscar winner, but neither is it dross, enjoy it for what it is."
"Bruce722","6","2","3","28 November 2014"," Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential.
","Godzilla was a fairly decent film but it had so much unfulfilled potential. The first flaw in the film is that the protagonist of the film was a miserable fail because Aaron Taylor-Johnson simply cannot act. Sure, he did great in Kick-Ass but the reality is that those films are more silly in nature. Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes that were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it. Making his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible acting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the film was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to add intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film. Honestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was about 30 minutes shorter. Johnson's lack of acting ability wouldn't have been so pronounced and the ridiculousness of the unrealistic drama wouldn't have existed. Those two adjustments and now we have a legitimately awesome Godzilla film."
"Wormholeninefanpage","8","2","3","29 September 2014"," Not bad, as others say, but has soooooo much potential
","Godzilla is one of those movies that you watch you don't hate, but when you how good it could of been.<br/><br/>First, on the good, Bryan Cranston, he gives a very emotional performance which actually brought a tear to my eye. Shame he is isn't in the movie that much. The realism is great with governments disguising monsters as earthquakes, it quite interesting. Also, Ken Wantabe, even though he is given cringe-worthy lines like ""Let them fight."" but his character was understandable and likable. Also, the action (the little of it) is well directed. Godzilla is well portrayed as an animal, and actually feels BIG.<br/><br/>Now to the bad, Aaron-Taylor Johnson, don't get me wrong, I like him but in this movie he is the most generic, uninteresting character, I've seen in a long time. I just about cared for him and his family to survive, but is the main character and add to the next problem. There's not enough Godzilla, there's a moment where you think ""Oh, stuff's about go down!"" but it cuts away from the monster fight that Godzilla is know for. What the actual hell! If this movie is about Godzilla at least let him have more screen time. If the is a good example is Pacific Rim, that movie was self aware and focused on epic fights and succeeded at that. Godzilla thinks that it can't have a bit fun. Speaking of fun, there could be better humour, to kind of lighten the mood and still feel serious, this is something that Marvel does well and would be good here.<br/><br/>My verdict is that Godzilla isn't bad, it is enjoyable and fun at moments but when you stand back and look back at the movie you see the potential it had and how good it could of been. 7/10 or a good time, no alcohol required."
"chaos-rampant","Null","2","3","27 September 2014"," The serpentine skin of flow
","Not many viewers will take to this. I agree with the first complaint, badly scripted and acted, bad even by comparison to Marvel's similar stuff. <br/><br/>I take a different tack on the other complaint, not much lizzard time. There's more behind the decision. The idea was to give us the usual Godzilla movie of destruction where a giant creature stomps around but through the eyes of people who run to and from it, as shifting glimpses of unfathomable beings tearing at the skies.<br/><br/>One clear example of this choreography begins with the discovery of the Russian sub on the island. We get no more than a vague first glimpse of Godzilla's hulk swimming underneath a ship, rushing to battle, followed by another vague reveal of only bits of a larger creature to the reddish light of cascading flares, a majestic unveiling seen by an audience of onlookers.<br/><br/>Then a child's pov from inside the stopped train as lights come back on, popping up one by one in the cordon of tracks, guiding our eye to the monster, another unveiling here. The train drawn towards the monster as if by the urge to see. All this prefigures the first encounter between Godzilla and monster; a first battle which we only catch glimpses of as news footage on TV as another child is dozing off on a couch, again teasing us with postponement.<br/><br/>You'll see again and again this choreographed pattern of withthold and unveil; humorously in the destruction of Vegas, more ordinary actionlike in the night bridge scene.<br/><br/>A superb moment that encapsulates the approach has a special ops team parachute down on the city from a plane, they have to do a plot thing about a bomb, no matter. A beautiful shot at the edge of the atmosphere as planedoors open, then as they fall, a first-person parachutist's view of the two monsters fighting among skyscrapers unfurls across the screen, a majestic glimpse of the larger event stolen on the way down.<br/><br/>How can anyone say there's no creativity here? It's what we came to see all along, monsters, only given to us in this more dynamic way, as ribbons of perception fluttering in the turbulence of spectacle.<br/><br/>I don't think a great filmmaker was stifled here by the blandness of what he signed to, but he may be a technician to watch. Watch this. It's pure Gothic horror reinvented by the eye."
"jimlacy2003","6","2","3","28 August 2014"," Entertaining, but obviously could have been much better..
","Having been a fan of Godzilla and in general monster movies (like the ""Gamera"" ones et al) I was really looking forward to this incarnation. Recalling back to the pre-internet, before DVD - even before VHS, days..you had to meticulously comb your local ""TV guide"" for a chance to see once of these late night or early morning weekends.<br/><br/>Now over all I found it pretty entertaining, but had a lot of holes in it where it probably could have been much better.<br/><br/>First the movie sort felt like it took it self too seriously. Maybe the idea here was to capture the essence of 1956 (USA) version. Where you are sort of a bystander to the story, seeing it from a third-person point of view.<br/><br/>To it's credit it captured other parts of the spirit of the movies like where the in the progression of the originals Godzilla is the hero. Also the acting and choice of actors was well, except I don't feel Ken Watanabe was the best role for a ""Dr. Serizawa"". In the original Serizawa hard this dark, sort of maniacal edge to him. After all he was some sort of scientific genius, and thus would be geeky/nerdy, with that weird edge you would expect.<br/><br/>Where I think the movie ultimately fails to it's potential was too much of this third-person view. In all of the Godzilla movies I've seen (most if not all of them) more of the focus was on the fights and interactions of monsters. It was one of the thrilling parts. Even being limited by the SFX technology of the time (rubber suits, detailed miniatures, etc.) one of the more interesting aspects. In this movie very downplayed.<br/><br/>Also part of the Godzilla experience was about character. You could see Godzilla had this personality, human like emotions, etc. He showed intelligence other then say just animalistic. Severally lacking in this movie.<br/><br/>Finally another classic part of the formula this movie misses out on is Godzilla's interaction and affinity for children. In some of the movies you would see a young (in the 8 to 12 year old range) boy talk with and be be bonded buddies. It connected this kind of special understanding, sincerity, and innocence of the child's point of view. A connecting of fantasy and reality and adding more of a personal/human touch.<br/><br/>As I write this I feel more and more that the creator's vision of this movie was fairly out of tune with what is/was really great about Godzilla. As if they should have studied more and could have consulted fans of the originals for advice, etc..<br/><br/>In the end is was entertaining and worth watching!"
"johndavidwest20","6","2","3","15 August 2014"," Godzilla: Inert Actors and a Middle-aged Monster
","It was in 1998 that Godzilla last dared to invade American soil. That last endeavor proved to be a critical disaster. Come on! Matthew Broderick's silly, bumbling scientist, and a very un-Godzilla-like mutant lizard! The only thing familiar was the famous roar. Of course, seeing Manhattan's skyscrapers destroyed, in the then new CGI, was pretty impressive. But, other than that, it wasn't Godzilla! In director Gareth Edwards' 2014 version, downtown destruction is spare; heart-pounding action is tempered; and the King of Monsters plays only a supporting role in the film that bears his name. Perhaps ol' King G has hit a point in his sixty-year-long career where all he has to do is show up, shoot some scenes in which he knocks down a few buildings, and fights a couple of monsters (with some rather unsatisfying collateral building damage). Despite putting on a few extra midsection pounds (even movie star monsters get midlife pudge), he still possesses the iconic name that makes audiences cheer when he (or she?) appears on screen. Like a sci-fi version of Brando—who later in his career occasionally came out of obscurity to fill a supporting role, collect his paycheck, become more eccentric, elusive, and obese— Godzilla has a name that is carved in cinema history, and Hollywood has proved in one week that they can bank on that name with ticket sales in excess of $150 million. Although he may need to shed a few pounds, he (or she) has certainly proved that Godzilla is back.<br/><br/>Since 1954, when Japan introduced the world to Godzilla, he has played the antagonist, the protagonist, destroyed megacities, fought armies, monsters, aliens; and, with the aid of pocket-size, singing, Japanese twins, he's defeated two giant moths; he's made us examine our neglect of the environment, as he fought a pollution-ingesting smog monster (Godzilla vs. Hedorah, 1971), and he's made us question our use of atomic weapons (Godzilla, 1954). Edwards's subtle homage to the film history of Godzilla is a pleasure for the knowing Godzilla fan. He gives audiences the traditional half-crazy scientist; the scientist's reluctant child, who holds some of their father's knowledge about the monster (see Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, 1974); two modern-day radiation-consuming, winged insects (versions of Mothra, 1964); and a Japanese scientist (Ken Watanabe) in dramatic close-up, with grave seriousness, as he tells the military the giant lizard-monster's name is Godzilla. (insert audience cheers). <br/><br/>Despite the young and attractive Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, a large portion of the cast is surprisingly older: Bryan Cranston (wearing a Barry Manilow- like wig), David Strathairn (forgettable military-commander Everyman); Ken Watanabe (whose every close-up says, ""I'm more concerned about my chronic constipation than these radiation-ingesting monsters""), Sally Hawkins (was she in it?), Juliette Binoche (also wearing Cranstone's Barry Manilow wig—or a short-haired wig that seems to say, ""Women scientists can't have long, flowing, girlie hair; they have to have short, practical hair""; but I think they allocated the film's hair- and makeup budget to CGI, or a trainer to build Aaron Taylor-Johnson's massive, Godzilla-like neck). Although these very accomplished actors' talents are grossly ignored and comic-bookized, they seem to serve the purpose of connecting the large audience of baby boomers, who grew up with the Godzilla movies during Monster Week on their local TV stations, to this 2014 version. <br/><br/>Like Godzilla vs. Hedorah, which used Godzilla's antagonist—a smog monster—as a metaphor for man's abuse of the environment (an early example of today's trend in environmental sci-fi flicks), environmental worry has supplanted the original Godzilla metaphor for nuclear anxieties. This time it's mistreated nature's wrath that we have to fear in the form of MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Environmental anxieties are ever-present today with some real monsters causing mass destruction, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, Japan's earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and countless Midwest tornadoes, just to name a very few. It's satisfying to symbolically destroy that which is destroying us. We may not be able to take revenge on Hurricane Sandy or predict the next mega-quake, but we can take cathartic satisfaction in watching Godzilla pummel radiation-ravenous, pterodactyl-Mothra-bat-glowworm-like things (a result of man's abuse of nature). <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards (Monsters) establishes his cinematic vision with some stunning shots that beg to be seen only on the big screen. One moment of note occurs high above the monster-ravished downtown San Francisco as a team of soldiers skydive into the city holding flairs that stream long ribbons of red smoke. It's a welcomed pause of cinematic beauty. While the special effects are impressive, Edwards doesn't overwhelm the picture with a constant roller-coaster ride of action sequences. There are some careful dynamics to his pacing. However, while we're waiting for the monsters to appear, we're subjected to countless dull scenes, filled with characters who are about as thrilling as watching people wait in line at the DMV. I just wish this Godzilla had fewer stars, less waiting, and more Godzilla. But at least the King of Monsters is finally back!<br/><br/>—John David West"

","I love monster movies, I love disaster movies. What I do not care for is the bait and switch as Godzilla turned out to be. I'm not a fan of spoilers so I didn't ""research"" this movie and went to see it just based off the media blitz, previews and honestly the fact that it was Godzilla! BUT, this movie is not about Bryan Cranston being a scientist against a radioactive monster. This story isn't about Godzilla attacking Tokyo. This movie has nothing to do with the previews. This movie is a pseudo love story that constantly takes you away from the action to watch a less interesting love story between unremarkable characters that the movie creators didn't deem important enough to be in the majority of trailers. This movie wasn't about a monster or the actors I expected. The graphics are top notch, the cinematography is on point but even the awesome monster scenes (which are fine) cant redeem this bait and switch tale. I gave it a 6 in honor of the history of the monster, the back story and graphics."
"boscopa-1","5","2","3","19 May 2014"," Lamezilla
","All I can say about this movie is that I was really disappointed. After a while I couldn't wait for it to end so I could express my disappointment and apologize to my girlfriend for making her sit through it. I am a casual fan of the Toho Godzilla franchise and while I acknowledge the stupidity of grown men dressed in monster suits trashing toy cities I enjoy these films immensely. The human back story became progressively loopier as the series progressed and I longed for a Godzilla film that would deliver the monster goods while providing characters that I cared about.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for the 1998 ""Godzilla"" that has been the scorn of fans and critics since its release. The movie is pretty bad for many reasons, from the horrendous performances of the cast to the awful design of Godzilla. While it was stupid it did deliver some pretty good action sequences and provided the mindless entertainment associated with the genre.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the 2014 incarnation of ""Godzilla"" in the era of making fantastic stories seem realistic and having flawed heroes battle their inner demons while failing to embrace the absolute awesomeness of being super. I am so sick of all these ""dark"" fantasy films that want to make a serious statement while avoiding any sense of fun. This film would fall into that category. It's about ridiculously enormous monsters destroying things! Godzilla should be about entertainment not addressing our disdain for nature; a topic that's been beaten to death in better films than this and one we have to see in the news every day.<br/><br/>As for this particular film I was disappointed by numerous things. First of all too much time is devoted to the MUTOs and not enough to the title character. In fact Godzilla is not on screen that much at all; several times the action cuts away just as a fight is about to start and instead of witnessing destruction we only see the aftermath. While this technique can be affective it occurs too often. There are some impressive shots and a few awe-inspiring moments but for the most part the film focuses on the human characters.<br/><br/>The second problem is the aforementioned humans. They are poorly drawn with minimal back story and about whom we care nothing for. It is impossible to be emotionally invested in any of them because they are all so colorless. The plot is nonexistent and is sewn together by Aaron Taylor-Johnson who somehow witnesses nearly every major happening in the movie. It becomes comical how he consistently dodges death while everyone around him gets wiped out.<br/><br/>Another huge issue I have with ""Godzilla"" is the performance of Taylor-Johnson who is a cipher in the center of the story. To be fair he is given little to work with but his performance is maddeningly awful. He is neither courageous, heroic, funny, or resourceful; just lucky. An absolute blank slate. Veterans like Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn, who are usually a joy to watch, are defeated by the trite dialogue and inane script. The only actor I enjoyed was Bryan Cranston and that is probably because I'm biased: I think he's fantastic. If he was the star his presence alone would have lifted the entire film.<br/><br/>I am still waiting for my ideal Godzilla film that provides interesting characters, a solid plot, and thrilling action sequences. If you are interested in giant monsters (and/or robots) grappling with each other then ""Pacific Rim"" is the gold standard. As for Godzilla films, watch the original Japanese version."

","Went to the premier tonight, thought it was below average. Typical blockbuster action movie, the director uses Hollywood convenience to make up for the massive loss of life. From a realist perspective, the effort put forth by the military would leave anyone with a basic understanding of modern weaponry clueless. The lead actor clearly didn't fit the part and it was obvious in the dialogue. Bryan Cranston was terrific in the movie and clearly able to break out of his Walter White role from Breaking Bad.

That's a stark contrast to the 1998 movie where Godzilla's first appearance was MUCH earlier in the film.<br/><br/>The last 30minutes of the movie though is where all the action is at... It features a cool battle between the monsters and eventhough Godzilla takes a lot of unnecessary damage, the battle is still fun and believable.<br/><br/>The entire movie is honestly worth a watch. I however would NOT recommend that you watch the 2019 atrocious movie titled ""Godzilla King of Monsters"" as that movie is quite horrible.

"filipemanuelneto","8","1","1","2 March 2020"," A new life for Godzilla, after years of being mistreated in the cinema.
","I confess that I was never a fan of Godzilla because it always seemed unrealistic to me. The amount of bad movies with the city-destroying monster doesn't help either. So, it is no wonder that I had little expectations for this film and decided not to see it in the cinema but at home, when it was on TV.<br/><br/>I felt, right from the start, that the film is concerned with creating a logical story to sustain the monster. The nuclear theme is there, but now it was not created by human bombs, it existed for thousands of years, drawing power from atomic radiation, like a chargeable battery. Even so, I did not feel completely convinced, given that radiation kills and, here, human beings seem at ease with a gigantic creature that certainly emanates more radiation than fifty thousand reactors. There are more times when everything sounds false and the story reveals weaknesses, but it is better not to take these issues further if we want to give the film a chance.<br/><br/>The script is simple: it all starts with a tragic nuclear accident in Japan and Joe Brody's search for what really happened. His search causes him and his son, now an American military man, to stumble upon a hidden truth: that there are colossal creatures in the world, older than Humanity and mostly asleep, who can wake up and endanger our lifestyle. They are monitored by a secret international organization called Monarch, and one of its leaders, Ishiro Serizawa, places hopes on the strongest and most powerful of them - the Gojira lizard - to control all the rest. The rest of the film is a trail of destruction, with humans screaming, soldiers firing, things on fire and colossal creatures in titanic battles.<br/><br/>The film features a cast full of famous stars but it is not the type of film we see for the interpretive quality of the actors nor do we have the opportunity to truly care for the characters. Moreover, most of the actors have little time on the scene and little to do. This is the case of Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen and Juliette Binoche. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is weak to lead the film but works reasonably as an action figure. Ken Watanabe is the most striking actor in the entire film, functioning as a kind of ""Master Yoda"" who knows more than everyone else and always has a cliche of wisdom up his sleeve. Watanabe always knew how to stay above the rest of the cast and give us a good job.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is grandiose and justifies the millions in the budget. Bet on creating a threatening environment, with a lot happening at night or in cloudy scenarios, where we don't see everything. There are cities devastated to the ground, a lot of noise everywhere, dust and animalistic deafening roars. The sound and visual effects are to be congratulated, as well as the entire CGI and computing department. Well-made sets, good props, good sound mixing and editing work are also very evident. The soundtrack, responsibility of Alexandre Desplat, is competent but not impressive or epic, as it could be.<br/><br/>Of all the films I've seen involving Godzilla, this is certainly the best. But it is the best because the others were too bad or too weak to compete with a film that has more money, more sound actors and better production values. It is a film that could be better, but it is good enough to be worth it."

The director & writers have taken the genre and stripped it bare to its core from the past, and what we have is a more grown up and interesting take on Godzilla.<br/><br/>The special effects are good, but its the tension and build up which is excellent, as we await the inevitable clash between Godzilla and some other bizarre creatures. Compared to the masses of other monster movies, this was far more interesting. I saw a recent Japanese Godzilla remake lately, and it was just boring. This one keeps you interested through much of it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that simply despite the improvements in various aspects to its peers, there's really not much more you can do with this genre. King Kong, Jurassic World etc have done much enough the same and there's little to get excited. Nothing too original, just another slant on the same old story.<br/><br/>The ending was nothing to write home about, and the usual gung-ho US army hero was too jingoistic for me to care about.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it was fine for an evening's viewing and better than many of its recent peers, but the genre is done like Westerns etc. It will keep getting rebooted as people seem to like remakes but all we'll see is updated special effects, and no new story.

","If there is one thing Godzilla 2014 excels at it is modernising the monster for mainstream audiences. However this movie does cause a divide, I feel between long time G-fans and new-comers to rhe franchise. The movie received harsh critisism upon release, all of which is simultaneously legitimate and not at the same time.<br/><br/>This is because by the standards of summer blockbusters there is a lack of monster action, the characters are quite bland and the plot is somewhat flimsy at best. However, by the standards of Godzilla movies, the monster action is well built up to, the characters are a lot better than most previous entries, and the plot is a refreshingly more realistic take on the monster that doesn't resort to alien invasions.<br/><br/>As a result there can be a lot of conflict between people unfamiliar with Godzilla movies, who may be rightfully disapointed with the lack of action and plot, and old school Godzilla fans, who might appreciate this plot for at least being a step up from some of the lesser enteries in the franchise.<br/><br/>As an old school Godzilla fan, I find this movie very entertaining and while acknowledging the flaws of this movie are real, can still enjoy it. The early death of Brian Cranston, the emotional heart of the first act of the movie, is the one thing that I cannot over look, however, because his character was the only one that wasn't an arcetype and was the best acted performance.<br/><br/>Other flaws such as the plot and drawn-out build up to the action I can be pursuaded to overlook because this is not the worst offender in the Godzilla franchise for using those flaws. Additionally, I found the slow pace of the film and teasing of the monsters added to the tension, and made the all-out finale to be all the more satisfying.<br/><br/>I have loved and enjoyed Godzilla films that could easily be described as worse than this one, and posted positive reviews to this site; So it seems unfair for me to gang up on this movie that I also enjoyed, even if it was lesser than the classics.<br/><br/>A faithful and respectful US adaptation of the monster that has the ability to entertain."

Reactors are in a containment. People do not venture into the containment when the reactor is at full power. I know we needed to kill some people off in the beginning, but there were far better ways.<br/><br/>Second science beef (there are many, I will just hit a few): No organism can ""feed"" off of ionizing radiation.

In the 98's movie, I felt really bad, Godzilla was depicted as a poor creature who get's killed by the humans, indeed I had the feeling that humans in that movie were the real evil, suppressing an animal who only tried to survive. I felt really sorry, it was like destroing a legend. This time however, is finally showed the real Godzilla, not good, not evil, simply above human perception of existence. Of course, in this movie there are some bad things too, some inconsistencies and contraddictions, some things seems conveniently too simple, like the main character living with his family in the very same place where in the end the action take place and where the monsters arrives from across the globe... But, whatever.. In the end I think this movie has more good things than bad, a great photograpy, a good script and a evocative soundtrack.."

","Gareth Edward's Godzilla is a good science fiction film and one most people will enjoy- provided they aren't fans of the Godzilla myth and history. Then perhaps they may feel the film is overlong, it doesn't show the giant lizard as much as it should or other trivialities. The setup is simple- We meet a research couple in Japan trying to figure out why the surrounding areas around a nuclear plant has strange activity going on. There is an accident and the wife is killed leaving the husband to go eccentric. We transport to the future where the couple's son- our hero has his young family. Soon a giant lizard appears on the fray and starts creating chaos in the American cities as we follow the young son's travails. The film is competently directed and features some nice scenes. The characters are also relatable. CGI is not over the top even though later on there are quite a few giant bugs and monsters onscreen. Edwards's first film Monster has a similar blueprint to Godzilla in that he prefers to show the characters with the monsters in the backdrop servicing more as an underlying theme."

","I wanted to like this but the script was pathetic. I have to say that the monster action was great. Seeing the battles on the big screen was very satisfying. Unfortunately the story line for the humans was horrible. What army blocks a bridge so school buses can't escape? Also why would they send school buses across the golden gate to get out of the city? It seems like they put people in peril only to fill the monster moments. <br/><br/>I really wanted to like this but the only fun I had was yelling at the screen at the disastrous plot points.

This movie had an estimated 160 million dollar budget for a reason, the reason are the details. Everything is so perfectly placed and originaly developed. The MUTO creatures, aside from the perfectly accurate looking Godzilla, look phenomenal, unic and beautiful, plus everything looks so real and blends with the environment. 7-8/10"

","I'm a huge Godzilla fan since I was around 5 years old. I was a fan back in the day when you couldn't find the original movies. You would see a few of the same ones at random movie rental places, but some were never to be found anywhere. I remember finally finding some mail order place that had them all, and I would save up and order a new one every time I had enough money. <br/><br/>The first US Godzilla wasn't Godzilla. I enjoyed it at the time, I think I was 14, but it just wasn't Godzilla!<br/><br/>I had been waiting for years to see the real Godzilla in modern special effects on the big screen, with a gritty story to match the original movie. I think this hit the mark. <br/><br/>I hear so many people complain that Godzilla wasn't plastered on the screen the entire movie. The way they minimally showed him really worked for me. The only time it bothered me is when they cut away during one fight with the MUTO. <br/><br/>The CGI, audio, size, and character of this Godzilla made such an impact when he was on screen, I didn't notice his lack of screen time. <br/><br/>I really liked the story, I liked the MUTO's, I loved the backstory of Godzilla with the nuke ""testing"". <br/><br/>It wasn't perfect. I would say a strong B+. With how much I also enjoyed Kong: Skull Island, I am really excited for King of the Monsters, and eventually seeing a serious take on King Kong vs Godzilla. The Japanese version is camp, although fun for what it is. <br/><br/>As a fan of Godzilla for the last 32 years, this movie was great."

Sometimes he dies at the end of the movie, sometimes he wanders off into the sunset..... not sure where to but then we don't know where he wandered in from!<br/><br/>If you want a film to engage you in deep thought then give it a miss.

"Morten_5","6","1","1","19 April 2017"," Nice blend of Japanese and American setting
","With his first feature film ""Monsters"" (2010), director Gareth Edwards showed a level of ingenuity and creativity that reached far beyond the Hollywood standards. His next project, Godzilla (2014), gave him a budget of $ 160 million. Hollywood had tried before to make its own version of the classic gigantic Japanese movie monster, but failed. Thankfully, Edwards does a lot better than Roland Emmerich did in 1998, creating a Gojira that the audience can care for, becoming the saviour of humanity rather than just a destructive force."

","I'm gonna use the minimum requirement for writing a review on this movie because frankly, there isn't really much to say about this boring movie. I give this Godzilla the three B's: bland, boring, and bullsh*t. When the action scenes happened, it was hard to tell what was going on because it was so dark. The story was so slow, waiting at the DMV seems more entertaining and action packed. Actually waiting at the DMV is pretty entertaining. I do it when I don't have to. People watching is so fun at the DMV. Anywho, back to this review. Acting was predictable and uninspiring. The ending made you say, ""I actually paid to see this movie?""

There is something truly terrifying about a ginormous creature that can basically do whatever it pleases and has special abilities. I was initially a little confused though as I was under the impression that Godzilla was the spider alien looking thing. I realised this was not so when Godzilla and the MUTO started to battle. But you know, it still worked for me even if I wasn't completely aware of what was going on.<br/><br/>Aside from the somewhat hard to follow storyline everything else about this movie was great. It had a great cast and just the right amount of action and special effects. It may not be your traditional blockbuster action flick but it doesn't need to be. A good movie all round."

"Wizard-8","Null","1","1","24 February 2015"," Not what I was expecting
","So far in my lifetime, I have only seen a few Japanese Godzilla movies, so I can't say that I'm an expert on the Godzilla genre. However, I do feel confident enough to say that the 1998 American Godzilla movie was a mockery to the genre. But my hopes were up that this reboot of sorts would be an improvement. It was... kind of. It takes itself much more seriously than the annoyingly goofy 1998 movie. The special effects are also pretty good, giving a good portrait of the monsters and the destruction they make.<br/><br/>But in the end, I was kind of unsatisfied. For starters, you might think that the movie would showcase Godzilla a lot, but you would be wrong. The movie is about two hours long, but for the first ninety or so minutes, Godzilla hardly makes an appearance! This is not the only case where the movie is coy. There are a number of scenes where the action starts brewing, but then the movie abruptly cuts to another location or the same location some time later. This is extremely frustrating. Another big problem is that while the monsters LOOK good, they don't get to show a lot of personality. The rubber suit monsters in the Japanese Godzilla movies managed to deliver a lot more personality than the monsters in this movie.<br/><br/>While I guess I could scrape up some more (somewhat) positive things to say about this movie, such as it's not boring (though it gets close to being boring at times), in the end the strongest thing I can say about this movie is that if you want to see an American Godzilla movie, watch this one instead of the 1998 version. Not exactly an endorsement, but it's the best I can do."

"PyroSikTh","9","7","18","16 May 2014"," The Best Monster movie since Jurassic Park
","This is a lot more character-driven than you might go in expecting. Godzilla does not take centre stage here, which becomes evident in the action scenes where our focus is deliberately shifted away from the giant lizard. This is my only real complaint, but it's a pretty damaging one. Putting the focus on the characters is one thing, but taking us away from the reason we're sat in the cinema in the first place isn't exactly a good idea. It's not always obnoxious, but on multiple occasions the MUTO will come in for the kill and Godzilla will attack back, and then the camera will swing round and follow the humans instead. It's frustrating.<br/><br/>Thanks to it's character focus, the plot is a bit of a slow burn. We get a rather long flashback to fifteen years ago to set-up the movie with a mining operation that goes wrong and reveals a rather large skeleton, and an open pod that leads into the ocean. Nearby in Japan, an engineer at a Nuclear Power Plant is concerned about some of the readings he's getting, but it's too late and the area is quarantined. This takes up a good quarter of the movie or so, and still takes a bit to pick up after that. The engineer is still obsessed with what caused the disaster and suspects a conspiracy. He takes his son back just in time for the birth of the MUTO. From this point on, I wouldn't say it was all steam ahead, but it builds and builds and never lets up until the very end. We're taken on a goose chase across the pacific culminating in the big climax in San Francisco.<br/><br/>For a character-driven story, I've got to be honest, there isn't a whole lot of meat to the characters. There's quite a lot of them to juggle and so there's only enough time to establish the core attributes of those characters; the obsessed engineer, the estranged son, the scientists who've been tracking it for fifteen years, the concerned wife. There isn't much else to them. However the focus on these characters does keep the movie grounded. It gives us faces to relate to. When the name of the game is suspense, you need characters to focus on, and Godzilla utilises that to it's fullest.<br/><br/>Thankfully for all the two-dimensional characters, the acting quality is sky-high. Bryan Cranston absolutely owns his role. Not going to lie, he moved me on an emotional level right at the very beginning before much had even been established. It was his performance that made me feel sad for his character. Unfortunately, while he was prominent in the marketing of the film, he's definitely not the lead. By the second third of the movie, he's completely absent. More Bryan Cranston wouldn't have gone amiss. The other great stand-out is Elisabeth Olsen. She gets even less of a character than Cranston, playing the wife and mother who's constantly worrying about her husband. However she has that special factor that makes the lacking character lift off the screen and feel like a real person. Again, more of her wouldn't have gone amiss. The rest of the cast did their dues. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the real lead and his performance is pretty good. It is however overshadowed by everyone else. He's the fairly typical hero, willing to do anything to save his family and his country, and thrust into everything by chance and coincidence more than anything. Ken Watanabe is brilliant as one of the scientists, as is Sally Hawkins as the other scientist. Again, not much to do, but they make their characters feel like real people, and that's what's important.<br/><br/>The effects are unsurprisingly amazing. Gareth Edwards, director of the fantastic Monsters, pretty much got his dream job here, directing a big blockbuster monster movie. He relishes in it. Godzilla never looked this good, harking back to the original bulky design, but of course with a lot more movement and detail. Watching him rise up against the dark cityscapes is an absolute beauty to behold; every other frame could be a piece to put on your wall. My only complaint here is that the MUTOs look a little odd due to a lack of tail. All they needed was a tail to balance them out a bit and they'd look killer, but as they are they look more like aliens than subterranean creatures.<br/><br/>But you know what makes me happiest about Godzilla? You remember that teaser trailer I mentioned? It's here, untouched. The first half with the skydivers to the sound of 'Kyrie' through these beautiful skyscapes is right there in the movie. That teaser sets the tone of the movie absolutely perfectly, because it's ripped directly from the movie, soundtrack and all. It's so tense and suspenseful from as soon as the MUTO is born in the first third, and the music goes a long way in creating that tense atmosphere. My only complaint with the soundtrack is one particular scene right at the very end where it goes into cliché mode. Eurgh.<br/><br/>Godzilla is, hands down, the best monster movie since Jurassic Park over twenty years ago. It's gritty and realistic, it's full of suspense that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, and a particular focus on the human element keeps it grounded amidst all the giant monsters. It's not perfect though, with underdeveloped characters and a frustrating tendency to not show the best bits. I give Godzilla a very good, and thoroughly recommended, 8/10.<br/><br/>http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/"

David Strathairn as Admiral Stenz - what can I say? These are just two, I could go on. Yes, the CGI is decent and the destruction caused by Godzilla and the two MUTO's is very good, but it represents two hours of my life I won't get back.

Maybe it should have been called Muto instead. You would think that they would give the audience what they came to see. The film was a big disappointment and did not live up to it's hype. The background story was long, boring and dragged on as well. My kids were also disappointed that it took so long for him to appear and then they still rarely saw him.

No motive is ever given except for a shrug which apparently states that it happens at times. - the human characters are irrelevant to the point where nobody would miss them if they weren't there. - the script is awful - Ken Watanabe is awfully underused and it seems to be a poster-boy for meditation, spending most of his time staring blankly and mumbling irrelevant things - there's some attempt at character development which is a waste of time as the 'characters' aren't really of any consequence in the story.<br/><br/>This movie feels like it should've gone straight to Bluray and I see little reason why someone would pay for the exquisite torture of watching this in 3D in cinemas."

","A lot of people watch film trailers of the film they are going to watch before watching the film. I don't as trailers always give away the plot or show the best bits. Well I wished I has watched the trailer for this film and saved myself two hours as not much happens.<br/><br/>Godzilla is of course directed by Gareth Edwards who bought us the film Monsters which had a very misleading title since there were no monsters in that film until near the end and up to that point it was just a man and woman trying to get from point A to B with a lot of talking in between.<br/><br/>Godzilla is more or less the same since we don't actually see Godzilla until about a hour into the film and even then its only a glimpse. The first half of this movie is taken up by some other monster dubbed ""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism,"" or ""MUTO"". This MUTO sleeps during the day and only seems to awaken at night which is of course when the action starts the only thing being is you can't actually see what is happening on screen as its night and the scenes are very dark and I mean dark. Its like someone forgot to turn the lights on. Think Aliens vs Predator Requiem or Noah once the rain starts. If you have seen Aliens vs Predator Requiem then you will know how dark the scenes are in that film and you couldn't see any of the action that is going on as the screen is dark 99% of the time well in Darkzilla its the same. <br/><br/>The MUTO and Godzilla scenes only take place at night where you don't get to see anything expect a odd glimpse of reptile scales. Why the film makers couldn't just have the MUTO and Godzilla scenes happen during the day I will never know. Any day scenes that are in this film mostly involve the US army doing what they always do in Hollywood films and that is stand around and talk and shoot a lot. Some of the American soldiers are shooting at this MUTO with their guns which of course is like shooting with a pea gun with a monster that size which did give me a laugh.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson doesn't do much in this film except fly here fly there and fly back again and that's about it really. Bryan Cranston is only in the film for about 40 minutes so is very under used as a actor.<br/><br/>If only the MUTO and Godzilla were in the daytime then this could have been a good film but unfortunately the film makers used up all the budget on the CGI special effects and therefore couldn't afford any lighting for the night scenes so had to film them in the dark.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the 1998 Godzilla even if its not perfect it done what it was meant to do that that was entertain and have lots of action something this film lacks. <br/><br/>Forget about Darkzilla and watch the original Godzilla (1954) or the 1998 one and avoid this one as it has no redeeming features whatsoever."

That is the first 20 minutes or so. After that the movie falls apart by focusing on boring ass human characters, and two other creatures that are looking like the exact copies of the Cloverfield monster. Why?! Oh God why?! I really try to understand the reason behind these ""creative"" decisions. But I fail. The trailer looked so damn good. Moreover, Gareth Edwards is an intelligent, if not an original filmmaker. Monster proved it. He knows what the audience needs! He is a bit calculating, but again, the industry is full with just plain bad directors. His approach is more than welcomed! If the movie turns out the same thing what was suggested (lied) to us in the trailer, now that could be the best monster movie ever! I was so bored. Really people, whoever reading this review I wish you knew me! Because if you did you would understand what does that, ""I was bored on a monster movie"" means! My relatives would have a seizure if they heard about this! I'm the biggest monster fan! Love Godzilla! I collect monster figures for Christ's sakes!!! I almost walked out from a Godzilla movie! The characters are boring, the monsters are not interesting, you don't see a real fight and when you do, it is not epic enough. The movie is over 2 hours long! I understand that Gareth Edwards wanted to tease us like Spielberg did in Jaws! I really do! But this is not teasing! This was literally pissing in our faces! My girlfriend, who is scared senseless even from the lightest thriller, said she wasn't scared, or worried, or even alive during the entire movie! Ah, people I stop writing this. I feel tired. I feel tired of the blockbuster season every year, there are these awesome looking movies coming out, and then they turn out to be terrible. Movies are not what they were. Real creative people not even getting close to directing anymore, and money people making the decisions. The movie gets 3 stars from me 1 for the first 20 minutes with Brian Cranston & Juliette Binoche, 2 for the design of Godzilla, and 3rd that the Olsen girl is so beautiful that it hurts. See it if you must, but brace yourself you won't believe your eyes. It is that bad. :("

","The movie poster art leads you to believe you are going to see Godzilla stomping and smashing buildings, trashing and burning down cities in his path, doesn't it? Well guess what? It's leading you on.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really even ABOUT Godzilla at ALL. If you add up all the time Godzilla is actually shown on screen, it probably adds up to less than 15-20 minutes. If you add up all the time that Godzilla is being discussed by the dumbstruck human characters in the film, you might have another 5 minutes, tops. If you add up all the screen time the story spends on the other two monsters and the scientists awakening them, and getting out of their way, then you've got the rest of the 2 hour film. It's like Legendary were finished making a CLOVERFIELD-like monster movie, AND THEN decided to license Godzilla at the last minute, tacking-on just enough scenes of him arriving to kill them off at the end, to sell it as a Godzilla movie. <br/><br/>They should have called it MUTOS. <br/><br/>The ball is back in TOHO's court to make the definitive modern CGI-GODZILLA movie, because this ain't it. >:("
"spankysblues","3","5","12","19 May 2014"," Didn't Like It
","Well, the first hour or so was quite good, and seemed to hold my interests. This is largely due to Bryan Cranston's (Joe Brody) acting skills. But by the time Godzilla made his first appearance, and Joe Brody was killed off (both happening roughly an hour into the film), things went downhill fast. The CG effects were abysmal, and not done in a tasteful manner at all. ie: night-time scenes (to hide the lousy CG),and at times the monster's appearance/size was noticeably disproportionate from scene to scene. You'd think Hollywood would have gotten at least that much right. From the middle of the film onward, the acting was also terrible, as was the script. It didn't even seem like the same film by this point. Maybe the writers from the first half also met their demise and were replaced by half-wits? And Pearl Harbor as a back-drop?? Lol, c'mon...typical American/Hollywood bullshit, so no real surprise there. Way too many clichés, as the hero in these films always seems to be a cop or military guy, and his wife works as a nurse in some hospital. Highly predictable, as the two are separated during the chaos, but miraculously reunite among a crowd of tens of thousands towards the end. I thought only Roland Emerich was guilty of such cheese. Though I'm sure some were delighted by the film, I felt ripped off, even though it cost us nothing to see, thanks to freebee company passes ;)"

Come on, where is the relation between the boring family story and the theme of the film?

The director also seems to hesitate between subtlety and explicitness.<br/><br/>And the visuals were very disappointing, except two terrific moments: the parachute scene and the Godzilla roar scene accompanied with the piano notes.

","So I actually saw this movie twice, one last night and one earlier today. The first time I saw it, the film was hard to understand/follow, and the action/monsters were basically the only thing that I paid attention to. Here is my review WARNING, SPOILERS:<br/><br/>To start, this movie was awesome! It really captured the true essence of the Japanese Godzilla but with enhanced effects. This is the first true American Godzilla film! The best parts of the film were, of course, the monsters. But not only that, the CGI done to create them was amazing and realistic! Godzilla was very realistic as well, and looked like a sort of hybrid between the Heisei Godzilla (after 1985) and Godzilla 2000 with the origins of the 1954 version; he was awesome! As for the Mutos, they were very unique and fierce too, looking very alien-like in appearance. They looked a lot more rugged and scary than both Godzilla and the Pacific Rim kaiju alike. The Mutos were badass! And the final fight was epic and brutal at the same time, and was very natural in movement as opposed to most of the Toho fights.<br/><br/>I felt that the plot and acting is being overlooked. The acting is not really THAT bad, and that is coming from one who does not care much about the acting. The scene in Janjira was tear- jerking and very intense, but well-done at the same time. After that, the acting does not mean as much.<br/><br/>And for the plot, it was simple, but yet quite well-done to be honest. It gave the Mutos and Godzilla a strong connection.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an EPIC film. Although, as with me, your first viewing might not get the message through due to the intensity of the film, the second viewing at least is awesome!"

","Just got back from seeing the new long-awaited Godzilla from Legendary Pictures. After reading a few negative reviews from IMDb critics, I didn't want to set my hopes too high.<br/><br/>True, it did take a while into the movie before The Big G showed up, but it didn't detract from the experience. There was enough of a build-up to keep things moving, including the appearance of the MUTO wreaking havoc at the nuclear facility. At that point, the movie kicks into high gear and doesn't let up. <br/><br/>The pros: The movie clocks in at 2 hrs/3 min.; an ideal time for this type of action flick. The design of Godzilla is near perfect, close enough to Toho's version, yet unique in it's own way. (The same could be said about his roar). The MUTOs were very well designed- even if they did have heads resembling staple removers- I was very impressed. The fight scenes were very well done, portraying Godzilla grappling more as King Kong would. He only employs his trademark atomic breath 2 or 3 times in the whole movie, which was just enough. The GCI effects were top notch. Even the acting was well done (especially Brian Cranston). Aaron Taylor Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Ken Watanabe were somewhat commendable-no complaints here. The scenes with the rail cars-the passenger train in Honolulu, as well as the one carrying the nuke-were a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The (very minor) cons: Bryan Cranston, who gives the best performance in the movie, is too quickly killed off. The battle scenes could have been dragged out a little more. Also, I would have made Godzilla's feet a little bigger.<br/><br/>Other than that, Garth Edward's Godzilla blows Cloverfield, Pacific Rim, and even Peter Jackson's King Kong out of the water, which is still saying a lot. As for Emmerich's Godzilla '98, the less said, the better."

","Anyone who is a fan of any generation of G movie will enjoy this. I would say this is a great, albeit imperfect film. The trailers are just deceptive enough to get you in the theater without knowing exactly what to expect. I say take this ride without any expectations plot-wise and you'll do just fine. This film was fresh and original, but also pays respect to Gojira(1954) and Godzilla 1985, two of my personal favorites, as well as the many films ranging from the 60s (kooky) to the 00s (badass). I feel like this was written for fans, but anyone who enjoys monsters will have a good time. My only criticisms are that G doesn't get enough screen time, some scenes of monster action are too abrupt, and the human story lines are not very compelling. This last criticism about the human element is just an inherent problem with G films--but I feel that they could have done better. I waited a darn long time for a good American Godzilla, and I believe my thirst has been slaked. For now. Yes, go see this and support future entries in the American Godzilla franchise, and if we get lucky we'll see a sequel or two. Even better, maybe a future Japanese Godzilla will be shown in our theaters for the first time since Godzilla 2000--now that would be awesome, too!"
"steve-83-602015","1","7","19","17 May 2014"," Although I (age 52) brought a lot of enthusiasm to the outing, it was the worse movie I've seen in a long time.
","The script wasn't good and the movie was hard to follow. A big bomb was promised but we didn't get it because the director had to let the monsters fight. We also didn't get the monsters eating the biggest bomb and getting even stronger than they were. Why even foreshadow that? I got bored with the movie. The audience was not moved by anything in the movie. Godzilla was too big, too long, and too bulky. I thought the movie was in bad taste in reference to showing the womb of the female monster and a bit too much bodily fluid. I didn't get enough on where the male and female monsters came from in the insect world, but, in their defense, they are massive, ""unidentified"" terrestrial organisms--not even a ""they're a cross between..."" After a good introduction to Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the character he portrayed, inevitably, I couldn't empathize with the human hero of the movie. He gets on the train with a kid who gets separated from his parents and he says meet us at the next stop--what a long ride before the next stop! Did we really need two little boys in this movie, his son and the boy who got separated from his parents? The boy who got separated from his parents either wasn't a good actor or the script and the director didn't serve him well. Elizabeth Olsen was good.<br/><br/>The climactic fight scene between Godzilla and the two monsters (MUTOs) was something to see--for a moment or two. It didn't rouse me or the audience. It didn't elicit any cheering."
"Likes_Ninjas90","4","7","19","15 May 2014"," Godzilla squanders the potential of its fantastic cast in favour of huge set pieces and special effects
","Godzilla squanders the potential of its fantastic cast in favour of huge set pieces and special effects. This is the second film by English filmmaker Gareth Edwards, following his impressive debut Monsters (2010), a low budget science fiction thriller set in quarantined Mexico. It had the brains to keep a central relationship driving its story and refreshingly held the aliens and the destruction in the background to forge a strong political critique. Godzilla starts a bit like this but then continually trades its characters and humanity for action that isn't involving or exciting. In fact, Godzilla grows dull and tiresome when it is apparent that there isn't someone to hinge our emotions onto. It is an extraordinary feat given the first rate cast, including Bryan Cranston, Aaron-Taylor Johnson, Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen and David Strathairn, each of whom only has a subpar script by Max Borenstein to work under. <br/><br/>The timing of the film is interesting, arriving after the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, giving the film some contextual relevancy. Godzilla has always been synonymous with nuclear power and warfare. The 'king of monsters' was first conceived by film producer Tomoyuki Tanaka in the 1950s as a response to the Second World War and the bombing of Hiroshima as a way of visualising the fear of future nuclear strikes. From then Godzilla became an enormous cultural staple in Japan, belonging to a group of creatures called ""Kaiju"" which in Japanese means ""strange creature"". The name Godzilla (or Gojira in Japanese) is a combination of ""gorira"" (gorilla) and ""kujira"" (whale). According to Wikizilla Godzilla is a ""daikaiju"" which stresses the power of the monsters. There have been twenty-eight Japanese films about Godzilla or Gojira, the first of which was filmed in 1954 by Ishiro Honda. It isn't a very good film but in that era, when a nuclear war seemed imminent, it struck a chord with people. This was also long before advanced CGI so Godzilla was made from a monster suit that was so hot and heavy that it required a valve to release the sweat of the actor inside.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this modern film has less personality than that suit. What was the intention of hiring Gareth Edwards if the film was going to be so standardised? As much as I enjoyed Monsters it was the only his first film but impressionable enough for someone to grant him a huge budget of $160 million dollars for this project. It was always doubtful he'd ever replicate the same achievement again but he did he have to make this film so self-serious? Like many blockbusters today, everything hinges on having a gloomy, sullen mood (it's called ""gritty"") and widely shot exteriors that are dark too but sometimes handsomely shot and sprinkled with foggy smoke effects. The people swallowed up in these enormous spaces aren't interesting in the slightest and entirely humourless. They are their drawn as little more than stereotypes and are only identifiable because of the heavyweights playing them. There is a conspiracist, a young military buck, a doting wife, a square jawed navy man and a pair of scientists. The conspiracist is Joe (Cranston), who vows to unlock a military secret after a death in his family. His son Ford (Johnson) grows up to be a bomb expert in the military and is married to Elle (Olsen). Watanabe and Hawkins play scientists that are keen to examine some unique species under the ground.<br/><br/>After an important central character fades there isn't a strong presence to guide the narrative. Ford is a one-dimensional indestructible hero with no flaws or backstory and he doesn't have the opportunity to create any personal conflict with the other characters. All the conflict is provided by the action and destruction and doesn't allow the actors or the director to impose their own personal imprints. The film seems as derivative as any other creature feature like Pacific Rim or blockbusters devoted to demolishing American cities. The actors are either misdirected or underused. Aaron-Taylor Johnson isn't charismatic enough to carry the film and Bryan Cranston in his early scenes appears overwrought and slightly off-key. Wantanabe and Hawkins are reduced to spouting scientific exposition, which might make your eyes glaze over, while Elizabeth Olsen, who can be powerful, is barely used until the final quarter. These actors deserved stronger material or at least an experienced hand to lead them.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film these actors and any mawkish family scenes run second to elaborate military operations that aren't always easy to follow or particularly tense. In Monsters Gareth Edwards critiqued the power of the military and their responses but this film is more conventional in how much time it airs to military hardware. Far more attention in the script has been applied to the backstory of Godzilla's origins than to the actual plot, which is silly throwaway stuff and comprised mostly of action so that the second and third act blends hazily together and only surprises at the very end. The special effects make big use of motion capture technology, courtesy of Andy Serkis' company The Imaginarium Studios, but the personalities in films like this shouldn't be discarded so that we still have someone that we can root for in death defying situations. Godzilla is terribly short on developing interesting characters and as a result it is largely mediocre."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","9","10 March 2015"," Godzilla, King of the Insomnia Cure
","Godzilla (2014)<br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>The ""plot"" really doesn't matter, now does it? Let's just say there's an accident at a nuclear reactor, which no one pays too much attention to until MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) wakes up and heads to the West Coast of America but also on the way is Godzilla.<br/><br/>It's clear that Godzilla movies are always going to be made and some are going to be better than others. I think the nicest thing I can say about this version is that it's slightly better than the remakes from 1984 and 1998 version. However, there are still a lot of problems with this version including the fact that it has to be one of the most boring action films in recent years. I really can't count how many times I kept looking at my clock to see how much longer this thing was going to go on. There's a family drama thrown in to try and balance everything out but this too is incredibly boring and goes nowhere.<br/><br/>I guess the worst thing about this film is also the best thing. The special effects are quite frankly excellent and once you doze off to the actual story, it's easy to just admire the work. For the most part the CGI effects really look good and especially the monsters as they come across very realistic and all of it blends in well with the real stuff. The various explosions also look very realistic but with this budget you'd expect that. Now, even though the special effects are great and the highlight of the picture, they're also a major problem. I really, really hated the look of the villain MUTO because it's supposed to be a prehistoric monster but instead it comes off more like a robot. For the life of me I couldn't help but think we were watching some sort of robots do battle and this here was just extremely disappointing. Even Godzilla comes across more like a robot than a prehistoric dinosaur. A real shame that as great as these monsters looked they couldn't have been more realistic.<br/><br/>There's a lot of family drama thrown in but all of it is just as boring as the action. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the lead and isn't given much to do, acting wise, and after a while it just becomes laughable that he happens to be at various parts of the globe just as ""important"" things happen. Even the usually wonderful Elizabeth Olsen can't bring any life into the picture. Juliette Binoche has a good cameo but even Ken Watanabe is wasted in his part. The bad story is a real shame on two levels. One, it takes up way too much of the running time and it's simply boring. Two, had they not gone for this boring melodrama then perhaps we would have gotten more of the monsters.<br/><br/>But, then again, that might not have been a good thing since the monsters are filmed through dark skies, fog and various bits of smoke. It's hard to ever get a great look at them. GODZILLA certainly has a group of fans out there but for me it was a complete dud."

You only see Godzilla for maybe 20mins tops in a 2hr film and mostly in pitch black because that's when all the fight scenes are going on. You can't tell if it's him or the other two alien creachers due to it being pitch black! The only reason I watched it to the end is because i was hoping it would get better. The story just seemed to focus on the guy from kick ass trying to get to his family rather than Godzilla and when it did focus on him you couldn't see anything anyway most of the time.

","At least it was better than the 1998 version. But it is still not really a memorable movie. It is a little bit too much in terms of taking an iconic Japanese movie monster and exposing it to the glamor of Hollywood.<br/><br/>The story is fairly consistent to the Godzilla universe; the massive reptilian Godzilla comes out of hiding to do battle against another equally massive otherworldly creature.<br/><br/>That was basically it, so don't sit down to watch ""Godzilla"" with the expectations of being intellectually challenged or stimulated, as that is not going to happen. This is pure and simply one of those movies where you just unhook your mind, sit back, and enjoy the pretty colors on the screen (well, not really colors, but the CGI effects).<br/><br/>And of course, the American army is fearless in the face of such a clearly overpowered foe, but halters not in their approach to take on the threat to the American way of life. It becomes a little bit too cliché.<br/><br/>What this movie survives on is the effects without a doubt. And hats off to the CGI effects team, because they really pulled it off quite nicely. The creatures were very impressive to look at, and very life-like as well (well, as much life-like as massive monsters would be, I assume).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the visual destruction of buildings and everything throughout the movie. And they hadn't been stingy on those. There is a lot of mayhem in the movie, but surprisingly little casualties given the enormity of the structural damage dealt in all locations that the Mutos and Godzilla were. So that was a little bit too Hollywood there with its political correctness.<br/><br/>One thing that I was missing was the iconic screech of Godzilla. They weren't really anywhere near that in sound or spirit. And let's face it, you can't have a Godzilla movie without his trademark screech.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" is an entertaining movie for what it is, a mindless CGI galore, and it is perfect for one of those days when you just want to do nothing. 6 out of 10 stars from me."

","In all of my years as a Godzilla fan this one had to top them all. Not only does the magnificent behemoth grace the silver screen with his size but how he is able to keep himself from hurting the environment while in battle although his opponents do not see it that way with their disregard to life. Yet to be fair the instinctive nature of perpetual reproduction will always have first place no matter the cost.<br/><br/>While in Japan Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) is a technician for the most important nuclear facility ever built. Teeming with high output the energy plant inadvertently awakens a creature from its slumber. Although not fully awake it starts to consume the nuclear power to feed itself while in a cocoon underground. However during this mere feeding, and as it stirs in its nest tremors shake the foundations until the plant collapses from the incredible strain killing Joe's wife in the process.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later his son Ford (Aaron Taylor Johnson) is called out to Japan to bail his father out from the local police detachment because of his outrageous behaviour towards the failed nuclear plant which has been taken over by high government officials. Now Joe must convince his son that not all is what it seems surrounding the plants secrets. So on a rec-on mission to gather data from his old house in the quarantine zone they are arrested on the spot, and brought to the plant where the slumbering creature finally wakes up.<br/><br/>Now it is an all out battle between Godzilla against two more that tries to create new offspring by using nuclear missiles as food. Ford after losing his father back in Japan decides to take the fight to them with the reluctant help of Godzilla back in the U.S. in the city of San Fransico. It becomes a battlefield when the three titans face each other in combat. Ford then notices eggs in pods which he exterminates using gasoline from a truck. After everything said and done Godzilla emerges victorious but collapses from his incredible ordeal.<br/><br/>I have to give this ten stars because of the nature of the story. It is a classic where good triumphs over evil although the good wears tough skin, and expels pure plasma as a defence measure. To see his face roar his insurmountable anger was always a high point in any Godzilla movie Japanese based or not. But what made me smile was the last scene where he picked his weary self up from the rubble, and stood facing the ocean and gave one last roar as if he was saying, ""Nobody screws with the Zilla!"" Then after dives into the ocean to head for home for a long needed nap. The multimillion year old Shogun had shown to all that his brand of justice has never faded through the years and he proved time, and time again.<br/><br/>The music was excellent plus the eerie chorus sound when the men jumped out for a HALO drop to retrieve a nuclear missile. Although used in another movie 2001 A space odyssey I found the chorus to fit this perfectly. With dark clouds, and stirring winds of torrential storms that were building up one stage to another. Ken Wantanabe is one of my favourite Japanese actors that has come a long way in his career. His grace, and regal disposition to his characters are always top notch.

","this movie is the worst movie I've ever watched. period. <br/><br/>for those who give it full stars, either you have emotional attachment to Godzilla or you are paid by the movie company to do so. <br/><br/>still don't understand how i got through it last month. <br/><br/>a total nightmare i would put. <br/><br/>a lot of people fell asleep during the movie and ppl around me started playing with their iPhone (most probably twitting their disappointments). <br/><br/>i was sitting there with my friend anxiously waiting for something good to happen, and it never did. <br/><br/>we went out of the theatre and looked at each other trying to figure out what the fxxk we just watched.<br/><br/>1. this movie has no plot at all. 2. all the Godzilla scenes are dark and short. 3. We don't even know which human should be the lead character, apparently Godzilla is the biggest support."
"anishwicks","10","4","9","21 June 2014"," So many movies to watch , is Godzilla the right choice
","I When to watch Godzilla with high hopes but also with the fact in the back of my mind that it might turn out to be as bad as pacific rim. It did neither, it was in the middle.<br/><br/>There were some bad things about it and some good so as always I'll start with the good.<br/><br/>I went to watch Godzilla after making a very hard choice between the new X-men movie and edge of tomorrow. Before I went to watch it I read the user reviews and the critics reviews and after reading both I realized equal amounts of users and critics have liked it and equal amounts have, we'll not really liked it. So anyway, I thought why not and I went to watch Godzilla.<br/><br/>Opening scene and the few scenes following it, I thought was a very good start for a blockbuster monster flick. Throughout the movie there were nicely filmed scenes with different filming angles and all that made this film very modern and i believe the director of Godzilla is the director that's got the closest to being as good as Christopher Nolan in directing. With epic camera shots and perfectly timed sound effects and very well picked music that gives this movie a very grand touch in the same time making you shiver in excitement, especially the part with the U.S. Soldiers jumping off the aero plane with the red dust or whatever it was and not to forget Godzilla looked quite real and scary.<br/><br/>Now for the bad, the acting to start with. Acting was very poor I thought and especially when you take children as some scenes main focus, you must know that the acting should be good, the only acting I thought was excellent was Heisenberg's as always. Also the destruction scenes and the fight scenes and all that are supposed to be epic have been made too epic, which is a bad thing because it makes it all silly and sometimes I wanted to close my eyes and wish it wasn't there in the movie because it was making me well less like it. The storyline was OK, not that bad and as I said it was the fight scenes and the destruction scenes that looked a bit silly which also affected the storyline a little.<br/><br/>As I said the first half of the movie was good but as it got to the second half it only got messier and less realistic and by the time it got to the end the story and all was just chaos. Still it was a watchable movie and if you want to watch something else instead then watch something else as this won't be as great as the movie you'll be looking forward to.<br/><br/>Not as bad as pacific rim and I think it was the cool filming and the music that really got it at least seven."

","I used to love Godzilla, and I knew I was going to love this one because it was in 3D. The first few minutes were good, then **** happened. I couldn't care less about any of the characters including Godzilla. What's up with the valleys on his back? Not cool. And the dinosaurs are too big to have been existing anywhere on the face of this earth unnoticed. This movie had ten points before I watched it, I'll tell you why it doesn't have that any more.<br/><br/>-1. Unbelievable story. No way three gigantic dinosaurs will go unnoticed for all those years, no way. -2. Acting went downhill when they killed the only person worth watching. You know who. -3. The loopholes are not supposed to be that obvious, if you haven't seen this movie you'll know what I'm talking about if you decide to waste your time and money, I recommend you don't spend any money on this, I regretted it. -4. Dinosaurs going rampant in the city crashing buildings and stuff and no mention of the casualty, in fact, Godzilla ends up being called a hero. Forget he crushed like a million people while fighting the bad guys, we'll just call them martyrs. -5. I did not understand the beef between Godzilla and the praying mantis couple. from what I got, they were two dinosaurs who were trying to get it on and have some cute little mantis babies but Godzilla wouldn't have any of that. If Godzilla isn't getting any, no other giant will. -6. Dinosaurs that eat planes, trains and nuclear stuff? Phuliz! -7. The loud music was too much but at least it kept me awake most of the time. -8. I dosed off a few times during the movie, I wasn't going to walk out after spending so much money on it.<br/><br/>I know there are more bad things about this movie but I dosed off so many times and I know I missed a lot and I'm grateful for that, just wish I would have bought the cheaper tickets. One thing that I will give this movie a thumbs up, is the cgi, awesome."

I have met some people who is not intending on seeing the film because they think it's just going to be be ""another monster movie"". Well hell no!

"kennethmcfarlane","2","4","9","15 June 2014"," Terrible Movie. They Made Godzilla Boring.
","If you want to watch a Godzilla film, go track down one of the early pre-90's films. This is a movie about an American soldier and the military not Godzilla.<br/><br/>The only good character played by the top billed Bryan Cranston, who then dies 20 mins into the film. With it any character depth and fluidity to the story also dies. So first stroke, the posters and trailers have already flat out lied.<br/><br/>From there the film focuses on the military chasing down the cloverfield monster that hatched from an egg found at the power plant in Japan that Cranston's Character worked at.<br/><br/>So from here let's list the problems with the movie.<br/><br/>Cranston dies, Son is unphased and when Ken Watanabe asks if he knows anything that could he just says ""I never listened."" completely forgetting about Cranston's apartment in Japan full of research.<br/><br/>Son is shown doing acts of heroism with the blandest face and barely emotes. He's also wearing the most impressive set of plot armour I've ever seen as he's the only survivor of monster attacks several times and shows no difficulty dealing with things, so you don't care if he succeeds.<br/><br/>People are barely surprised or scared of these giant monsters that have just appeared. Let alone the military who just learn about Godzilla's existence from Ken Watanabe. Also they don't notice these 60+ft monsters until they're on top of them<br/><br/>There's a chance to showcase 3 monsters fights all of which cut to TV screens or nameless military personnel talking about how to stop them. Then you finally see a fight 5 minutes before the end.<br/><br/>A second egg hatches in Nevada for more cloverfield shenanigans that gets cut.<br/><br/>Military follow Godzilla and then later start shooting him for no reason.<br/><br/>Despite knowing about the EMP, military keeps throwing boats and planes at the monsters.<br/><br/>There's no character development so you just plain don't care about any of the characters (bar Cranston), even Godzilla! I can't remember anyone's names. Son's family also do nothing but take up screen time and add nothing to the movie. <br/><br/>5 minutes before the end we finally see a fight between Godzilla and the cloverfield Monsters but, because we haven't seen any thing before you don't care if either is going to win. And Godzilla does win, but then he dies at the end and you just don't care, Then he gets up again the next day and he's fine but, you don't care because he's not had nearly enough screen time.<br/><br/>Through out the whole movie you only cared about Cranston's character and when he dies all character depth and development goes out the window for the sake of showcasing the different divisions of the American military. Seriously the Son hangs out with Navy, Ground forces and jumps out a plane. All instead of going to save his family from impeding doom, he volunteers for missions. This would be okay if Taylor-Johnson emoted during this and made it interesting by trying to interact with other soldiers but no, that would be asking too much between cutting out monster fights and cutting to the family.<br/><br/>This movie lacked the science techno-babble and exposition that makes these kind of movies great and they even had the chance to do that with Ken Watanabe's Character but instead they decided to focus on American Military, and an emotionless do-nothing-wrong jar-head.<br/><br/>Terrible acting, no character depth, too much exposition of the army, cutting the monster fights, no focus of plot, unoriginal designs for the new coming monsters, no exposition. <br/><br/>2 stars, 1 for Cranston, 1 for Godzilla's design.<br/><br/>Stop letting America make Godzilla films!"

","ughhhhh just don't. I would have been more impressed and ironically made better plot points if it was rex from Toy Story tearing s**t up. The acting from this movie besides Cranston was useless. I felt id get more emotion from a puppet show street vendor then Aarron Taylor Johnson. I understand trying to surround Godzilla in shadow in mystery for the first half the movie, but my Jesus itsssss Godzilla we have seen him a hundred times before. When any action does happen its good for all of five seconds then we cut to the trials and tribulation of Kermit taylor Johnson and his useless plot point of a wife Miss Piggy Olsen. Over all the only mass destruction was my aching brain to which there is no damage control. For the amount of time Godzilla spends as end in the water they may be able to create a lovely aquatic musical someday."
"koen_smit","9","4","9","31 May 2014"," This movie gives so much more than you would expect.
","What do you expect from a monster movie? Well, monsters, devastation and human casualties of course. What I didn't expect was a whole new use of historic events, an explanation how nature has its order to restore things, casualties that did actually make me emotional and a sympathy for Gojira (as the Japanese call Godzilla) who doesn't turn out to be the bad one. <br/><br/>Yes, from the trailers I saw before this movie I was intrigued, because I love monster movies and I've been told this would be a classic Gojira and not the dinosaur-lizard we saw in the previous blockbuster. The trailers put you on the wrong foot thinking what this story is about, they didn't show the other monsters (yes, there are other over-sized evil monsters roaming the earth!) – they didn't spoil my movie experience like so many other movie trailers do, where you have seen the entire movie already within 30 seconds. <br/><br/>Add some pretty good acting, a good character build, a believable story, great special effects and cgi and you have a winner. Maybe the only disappointment in the movie for me was casting Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. Compared to the rest of the cast he was just not good enough. Luckily his part is small so I could accept it. I did understand the choices his character made, but his acting didn't sell it as well as it should have done. He is after all the one that should lead you into sympathizing with Gojira. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson (my, how he worked on that body!) only needs one look and gets that sympathy done immediately. We should really keep an eye out for this guy, I expect a lot from him and so far he delivers in every movie I've seen him in.<br/><br/>I think the filmmakers did a great job with this movie. Gojira rules."
"ianb330-112-344579","10","4","9","27 May 2014"," Bloody Brilliant!
","On the way to see this, I told my son that if it wasn't the greatest movie in the history of film I would burn down the cinema. Well, it's not the greatest movie in the history of film (that accolade is still reserved for the late Tony Scott's 'Unstoppable'), but the cinema is still intact and completely un-charred.<br/><br/>People who see this movie will be split into two groups: those who have seen Gareth Edwards' directorial debut 'Monsters' (the minority), and those that haven't. Those that have will be delighted that all his early promise and potential has been realised in such an impressive manner. How many other directors could render a 300 feet tall plasma- breathing monster so as to elicit such sympathy and support from the audience, or, as my son put it: 'He made Godzilla subtle'. Those that haven't seen 'Monsters' - well, you're missing a treat. And as for those complaining that Godzilla didn't feature enough, remember that sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a bloody brilliant film, which, after the abortions that were 'Prometheus' and 'Pacific Rim', has restored my faith in the big-budget blockbuster."
"rcwin32","9","4","9","26 May 2014"," The King of Monsters Reigns Supreme!
","The trailers for this movie got me really excited and, going into the cinema, I expected a lot. I was not disappointed! I really liked the way they didn't straight up show Godzilla in the beginning of the movie, and how they showed slight glimpses of him in order to build up the suspense. This made the ending even better, to the point at which I would consider it one of the best endings of all-time. They gave Godzilla the opportunity to shine during the final 30 minutes or so and he certainly did not disappoint!<br/><br/>There were a couple things I would've liked to have seen differently, however. The first is the father being killed off too quickly. I wish he would've stayed in the movie much longer than he did. For what screen time he had though, he did a fantastic job, the best job in my opinion. Secondly, I would've liked to have seen a little more of Godzilla's atomic breath, since it is arguably his ""signature"" trait and it's pretty cool!<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was a movie well-done. The way they introduced Godzilla, building the suspense and not showing all of him until the second half of the movie, is important because now they can create a sequel where Godzilla is fighting throughout the entire film. A movie that has the potential to be pretty awesome! Godzilla has made a triumphant return to the screen!"
"surfrider_85","10","4","9","22 May 2014"," From a lifelong Godzilla fan....
","I'm disappointed with all of the people who are panning this film due to the fact that Godzilla allegedly did not get very much screen time. These people do not remember watching Godzilla from 1954, clear up through the recent Toho productions. Godzilla got as much screen time as a Godzilla fan would expect. Most of the older films had extremely cheesy stories (Godzilla vs. Megalon anyone?), but this one I felt had a little more substance. I was more afraid that we would end up seeing a film where Godzilla would be the all-out villain, with the humans trying to mercilessly kill him. Instead, they tastefully gave me the ""hero"" that I adored as a kid. When I was growing up, I loved Godzilla. I liked when he was scary, but I also liked when he was the hero. I loved how Godzilla was unstoppable, godlike, and powerful. When he took more of an anti-hero role in the Heisei era, I (and my childhood friends) cheered him on all the more. This movie portrayed Godzilla much in the same way. However, they left us wondering. I felt Godzilla and the main character were sharing somewhat of an affinity toward the end, whether real or imagined, the director knew what he was doing and I think it worked. It doesn't mean that Godzilla is our friend per se, but I like how he wasn't necessarily portrayed as an all-out villain. In my opinion (and I have watched and own every single Godzilla movie ever made, except 1998), this was a fantastic movie. I hope to see Edwards do one more. It was great to see the Big G on the big screen and the monster battles were epic."
"drew_atreides","8","4","9","22 May 2014"," Less is more
","..the flavour of the day with GODZILLA 2014 is that less is more.<br/><br/>Having loved Gareth Edwards' ""MONSTERS"", i was quite excited when i heard he was helming this new GODZILLA-entry. Tack on the incredible acting names that he pulled (Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, David Strathairn) and i gotta say i expected more then your average Godzilla entry.<br/><br/>And boy did we get it. <br/><br/>I really liked how the Monsters had personality, and really they weren't BAD guys. They just paid us no heed, really, as we are like ants to them. Its all very similar to ""MONSTERS"" in that regard. They are really just trying to exist in this world.<br/><br/>The action set-pieces were awe-inspiring in their scale. Very exciting, and the build-up to the final fight was incredible. <br/><br/>I really hope Gareth Edwards is involved with the next film in the series.

","I grew up watching the old Toho stuff of Godzilla battling monsters and wreaking havoc and having heard all the praise Edwards was getting I expected something along those lines.<br/><br/>Alas, He lived up to his boring legacy after 'Monsters'. Anyone that followed the hype and saw the Japanese toy line knew about the other creatures but honestly what I expected was something along these lines:<br/><br/>Alien monster thing attacks, Godzilla awakens and destroys it, Godzilla destroys civilisation. The trailers made the movie seem like something it definitely wasn't.<br/><br/>Godzilla's origins were too vague, people just kinda knew who he was and were like, ""cool, Godzilla's here"" Sure, the climactic battle is good and Godzilla himself looks great, his foe on the other hand looks like a sleeker alien Cloverfield and the movie is over incumbered with tedious, made for TV melodrama.<br/><br/>This movie is the biggest disappointment of the year so far and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"FubarSFBD","4","4","9","22 May 2014"," Atrocious
","Godzilla 2014 is one big lie. If you are interested in seeing this movie because of the awesome trailers - I have some bad news for you. You probably already went through several negative reviews here and might be wondering, is the movie really that bad? Well...unfortunately it is.<br/><br/>Unless you are a 12 year old who wants to see a couple of giant bugs walking around and a bunch of people with no facial expressions trying to shoot them down with M4s, you WILL be disappointed.<br/><br/>There is one positive thing i can say about the production - the CGI is decent. It's not mind-blowing though. The rest is just a terrible mess of plot holes, nonsense, absolutely terrible acting and a missing script. The characters are absolutely terrible and flat, with zero development, which would not be so bad if the movie was not trying to force them on you all the time. This is NOT a fun giant monster movie. Instead of focusing on the cheesy parts and let us have some fun with it, it tries to be a serious human-oriented drama, and it fails miserably to deliver.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues is the acting. Honestly, I haven't seen such poorly executed excuse for it in a very, very long time. With the exception of Bryan Cranston, who dies after 15 minutes, the rest of the people that took part in the production have absolutely no idea how to act. They look flat, uninterested and boring. There isn't a single WOW moment or a single piece of dialog that won't make you wish to go to bed. Nobody seems to care that there are a couple of giant monsters destroying everything on their way and acts as if this is something that happens every now and then.<br/><br/>The decisions that most characters take are also unbelievably stupid. Just watch the Golden Bridge scene and you will understand...<br/><br/>Godzilla itself has a relatively small role in the whole movie, it looks fine, but out of place... It feels as if someone took Starship troopers, made the bugs bigger and then solved the issue by throwing Godzilla at them for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>The ending is extremely cheesy and a total cliché, as is the whole movie. Honestly, if you think this was a good, enjoyable movie, you are either 12, or have absolutely no taste or understanding of proper cinema.<br/><br/>AVOID"

But it is still this is a great movie."
"RforFilm","7","4","9","21 May 2014"," The king of the monsters is back, but we could have used more Godzilla in Godzilla.
","The days of miniatures and guys in rubber creature suits are long since past. Back in the previous century, this was a long-standing way of making an entertaining monster movie. It didn't really need much of a character development story to make for a great film. The people who saw this, were here for the monsters and city destruction. That was enough to make the Japanese monster Godzilla such a cultural icon for over fifty years. If you do your homework, you'd be surprised to find out that there are more then thirty Godzilla films, ranging from having him as a terrifying force to saving the world from other monsters to even making him a children's idol to look up to.<br/><br/>The Godzilla series was something else I loved as a kid, though it wasn't easy for an American like myself. The movies are very hard to find (these were the days before we had the convenient Netflix) and rarely show in theaters (I saw Godzilla 2000 in theaters), making hard to persuade my friends that wanted modern special effects and better story telling. Today's movies can't work on special effects alone, often needing that griping story that for something like giant monsters, is hard to pull off. The American Godzilla gives the famous monster a second round at combining action and a western setting.<br/><br/>The story begins in 1999 inwhere else but Japan where scientists Ishiro Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins) discover a giant skeleton and a hatched egg where one of the creatures as escaped into the sea. At the same time, a power plant supervisor Joe Brody (played by Bryan Cranston) nearly escapes a meltdown when seismic activity destroys the place. The disaster, written off as an earthquake, results in an evacuation and quarantine of the Japanese area. <br/><br/>Cut to fifteen years later where Joe's son Ford (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an officer in the Navy living in San Francisco with his wife Elle (played by Elizabeth Olsen) and son Sam. He finds out that Joe has been arrested for trespassing in the quarantined area, forcing Ford to go back to Japan. Joe and Ford return to the quarantine zone to collect disks that reveal a cover up. They are arrested and taken to a facility where an egg hatches, unearthing a winged creature called a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) destroys that place and flies off to the United States. The scientists and the Navy reveal another creature, Godzilla, as the only thing that can fight off the MUTOS as Ford tries everything in his power to get back to his family.<br/><br/>To combine a tragic story around a monster like Godzilla in today's time is hard to pull off. Does it work? It does in many areas. Last years Pacific Rim perfected the combination of having good human characters in a giant monster movie. Godzilla took a lesson by applying the same idea of good actors playing good characters. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's story of getting home was good, reminding me of War of the Worlds. Brian Cranston steels every scene as a broken man attempting to expose a conspiracy, even if we've seen this before. Even the story of the military trying to kill the monsters is good. What's missing is Godzilla himself. He doesn't show up until an hour in, but when he does, it brought me back to my childhood. The creature is given a modern, CGI look that is defiantly worthy of the title ""GODzilla"". I just wish there could have been more of him. He's in about twenty-five minutes of the entire movie, giving th story to the people. This is like getting a taste of a gourmet chefs food without getting the full dish. I guess it's better to have a little of something that great rather then to have too much of it.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven rubber suit Godzilla's out of ten. Had their been just a little more monster action, this would have been one of the best of 2014, but I had fun. I was satisfied with the new American Godzilla. Lets just hope that if they make sequels, we get to see Mothra, Mechagodzilla or King Ghidorah fight the king of the monsters. Oh, and more Godzilla would be nice."
"SforSmile","7","4","9","21 May 2014"," The King of Monsters has Claimed his Throne!
","Finally Godzilla arrived in the 21 century in all his computer animated glory and it all starts where the myth originally came to life: Japan!<br/><br/>What I liked the most about this version is that the director takes the iconic figure of Godzilla very seriously and pays tribute to his roots which is not only mirrored by the monster's traditional looks in contrast to the version of 98, but most of all because the director has understood what Godzilla stands for, which is the pure power of nature, it's a metaphor for all the uncontrollable natural catastrophes that we are helplessly exposed to and a warning of nuclear destruction in the sense of its Japanese creator who developed the idea of Godzilla as a response to the atomic attacks on japan. So it's a logical consequence that we find a lot of references to current major catastrophes in this movie like the great tsunami catastrophe in 2004, the core melt accident in Fukushima, and there are even scenes that reminded me very strongly of ground zero and the aftermath of 09/11 with all the fire men looking for buried survivors in a ruined, dust-covered surrounding. This affinity to real disasters that we have all seen on TV enhances authenticity and thrill factor of the movie.<br/><br/>What's also extraordinary about this release is the way the fighting scenes are presented. It's not only the usual confrontation of several monsters whereupon a whole city is getting destroyed, there is more to this, the director plays with our expectations, he postpones fights, uses special camera angle's and finds quite pictorial ways to present the scenes which thus have a certain poetic quality to them, something unique that was not seen in any of the previous Godzilla movies due to the lack of cinematic means.<br/><br/>In a time where massive city destructions are seen in movie theaters on a regular basis (I mean, the ""Transformers"" series alone showed them in each of the three parts, not to think of ""Pacific Rim"", ""Avengers"" etc.) it is refreshing to see that you still can get something special out of the same genre-typical elements. so everyone who expected just two hours of mindless battles might be surprised by how much thought lies behind this beautifully depicted clash of monsters. It's true, that it takes a while until we hear Godzillas famous roar, however the time it takes is not spent in vain as it serves the creation of suspense and gives space for character development in the context of which the one and only, living legend Bryan Cranston plays a major role as an obsessive scientist who is involved in a very touching family drama. His son, a soldier, later attracts the focus on his struggle to fight back the threat (very evil MUTOS) with military means as there soon comes the point where scientists get pushed back to an counseling role like it is the case with Ken Watanabe who plays an Japanese scientist, a brooding voice of reason and an intermediary between the cultures; its good that the producers chose a Japanese actor to play such an important figure.<br/><br/>The director Gareth Edwards did not reinvent the entire genre, there are still the typical ingredients to be found, but a very smart script that offers some good twists, a strong cast and a very beautiful cinematography make this movie one of the most ambitious and impressive contributions to the monster movie franchise, maybe not as good as ""Jurassic Park"" but definitely worth seeing. If the Godzilla of 1998 was a silly joke than this one is an awakening, the first milestone of a new era of Godzilla movies that will be measured against this one. The king of monsters has claimed his throne!"
"rmiranda19","2","4","9","21 May 2014"," Disappointing
","The movie starts at a good pace as the major stars are introduced. Juliette Binoche lasts all of 15 minutes. Bryan Cranston is around for another 20 minutes. Ken Watanabe was great in Letter from Iwo Jima, but in Godzilla played a very flat character. The rest of the cast was very bland. The CGI was outstanding as the monsters all looked ferocious and looked great against the cityscapes - this is not your 1950s-60s Godzilla movie. As I said the movie started at a good pace, and was very excited. But as the story dragged on so did my excitement. By the end I was as disappointed as its prior re-boot. The MUTO's I found were looking like a mix of Cloverfield and the smaller parasites that was on it - a huge bug with an attitude. Them eating the nukes were laughable and quite stupid. I, being a big Godzilla fan, was extremely disappointed - I do hope the next reboot will come from Japan, because as campy as those films are - they are 100 times better. And lastly - since when does ordinance disposal soldiers do HALO jumps? Really?"

Some 1* reviews said it's the worst movie, unwatchable, these people are either trolls or were drunk/high during the screening.<br/><br/>It's a tad different to the last one because this time there's not just Godzilla humanity must worry about, without giving too much away the other creature called Muto is equally as large and terrifying (they remind me of earth's weapons from Final Fantasy 7). The film isn't tongue and cheek like the Matthew Broderick one, it's realistic and darker with some quite tense and emotional moments.<br/><br/>The pace isn't in a rush or snail slow, it builds and has good story, at times catches you off guard. Until the brutal showdown.<br/><br/>Definitely worth paying £5 at my local cinema.

Granted, I admit, I still enjoyed seeing a giant monster destroy NYC, in a Jurassic Park clone sort of way, but it was not a true rep of how big G should be treated. I've been waiting for a movie like this my whole teen/adult life. One that plays it straight, has great effects, and makes big G .... scary.... the way my childhood mind always pictured him. I can not understand what people are complaining about. G's design looked great, we had great effects, dread, action, destruction, he fought monsters.... Even the 3D was great. As soon as I see this listed in a 3D Blu Ray combo pack, I will pre-order. Can't wait for a part 2!"
"nicogomezic","6","4","9","19 May 2014"," ""The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control, and not the other way around"" Godzilla is the perfect model of ""technology"" film.
","To start a film in which there is to wait for an hour and a few minutes to see the star of the film, forward obviously to see the new face and image of the new Mutant lizard of this reboot, a fairly slow start in which from the beginning we are 15 years before the events in the film.<br/><br/>I want to start saying that the new image of Godzilla is simply the best you ever had seen, another point of view to stress is the incredible and spectacular image quality and effects are top-notch as well becoming one of the best films of special effects of this type and in that the scenarios contribute a lot to the credibility of the film.<br/><br/>It may be that you for viewers who crave to see Godzilla, the start of the film seem somewhat slowed, but otherwise this film would be one of the bunch, but this installment is not one most of the heap we have seen, for the first time we see that give us information accurate over the fact of the creation of Godzilla-based nuclear tests. Talking about the effects I think that they are simply incomparable, from this point of view the film becomes a candy for the viewer.<br/><br/>Maybe for many who don't know much about Godzilla, believe that the true antagonist of the tape is the same, but nothing else far from reality because the fact is that we are talking about one of the most popular Anti-Heroes in history... for anyone thinking of Godzilla is to think of chaos, destruction, lost city, complete meltdown!... but Godzilla is the real Savior and fair star of the movie.<br/><br/>From the point of performance I think that Aaron Taylor-Johnson made a paper quite acceptable but nothing more than that, a far cry from the Kick-Ass role by the way. However the role of her father in the film (Bryan Cranston) who makes acts as well as what has been done in Breaking Bad, on the one hand the best performance in the film and also as that is the feeling that could contribute something more to the tape that just a few minutes on screen.<br/><br/>Ending this review I think not even say that this new version crushes the irrelevant 1998 without any mercy, another thing is which in my case is surprised to enter and see the IMDb rating..., when I saw him couldn't believe it... 9.3? It seemed a miracle but obviously as usual average was supposed to decrease of a few and is currently at 7.5 which is still a relatively high score<br/><br/>In conclusion: Gareth Edwards shines with a dark and entertaining story that really has cheesy spots at certain times, but that is not enough to overshadow the film in its entirety. Incredible audio and sounds, good introduced music, video of first quality and of course effects that captivate any viewer, the script is common but that otherwise might be...? Godzilla has more than ten film adaptations, and this is not so much the typical film military vs Monster but it shows more than just that. Finally Godzilla takes all being and becoming the surprising New York and practically the world Savior.<br/><br/>No doubt the best Godzilla film to date, simply recommended proposal for anyone, it is a film that should not be missed."

","I'll start this by telling you what I have told many others. This movie and the effects are stunning. The visual intensity that you experience is stunning. I find it amazing how all of the visuals and action can fit into one movie and screen!<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>For the sheer beauty of the visual and graphics in the movie, the story line suffers. To me, it showed that after a while, humanity stopped trying to rid itself of Godzilla and just accept it for what it was. Until, a radiation absorbing/ingesting bug comes along to breed itself into the food chain. Here comes Godzilla to restore that dominance and delicate balance. Now comes a 3 front war. The war between Godzilla and this new foe and its mate.(WWE Triple Threat Handicap Match!!), and humanity trying to do what it does best, and kill all the big things that are ruining everything. Long story short, Godzilla is the man and retreats back into the abyss to be left alone. While people stand into a devastated and destroyed city. I would be wondering why this massive dinosaur just left like it was another day, and we did nothing but drive a nuke off the coast to detonate(don't get me started with that..)<br/><br/>As I said, for as visually and graphically stunning this movie is, its story line suffers. I would not go to the extent to say that it decreased its value. But, anyone with a brain stem can see these holes.. ENJOY!"
"dreamdemon-1","2","4","9","18 May 2014"," Awful script but beautiful CGI
","I'll start by saying that the only thing the movie has going for it is Godzilla and the CGI. The movie features some beautiful CGI shots, especially just prior to the final battle (the HALO jump as well as Godzilla walking through the thick cloud of debris).<br/><br/>And that's about all that there is good with it. The movie spends a lot of time on characters that are inconsequential to the story. It focuses a bit on a nuclear power plan manager who loses his wife in a freak incident that turns out to be a monster feeding off nuclear fuel. The drama feels cheap and doesn't advance the plot one iota.<br/><br/>Similarly, the manager's son (a military lieutenant) is pushed as the main character but without driving the plot forward.<br/><br/>Indeed, it would be difficult for a human to do that as the plot is about Godzilla fighting two nuclear fuel eating monsters. The monsters spend their time ignoring the humans and going about their business (procreating and fighting). They are awesome, huge and nice too look at. That's all. The humans are there to justify some upward shots emphasizing the magnitude of the events and how little we all are.<br/><br/>Also, some soldiers spend some time praying and praising 'our great nation' (America, obviously, as opposed to the monsters originating from Japan).<br/><br/>The events leading up to the main battle make little sense (then again, why would they - the first hour or so pushes hard to pitch monsters against each other).<br/><br/><ul><li>what's the point of blabbering about 'echolocation'? it only results in discovering a second monster minutes away from Vegas. Without that piece of information the outcome would have been the same. - Ken Watanabe spends all his scenes staring blankly and mumbling pointlessly about some 'balance'. - somehow the monsters that previously fed on a Japanese plant ignore the string of American nuclear facilities on the West Coast and go straight for a measly nuclear bomb. - somehow monsters that feed on nuclear radiation and use echolocation to move about are in need of eyes and mouth. Huge missed opportunity to bring some much needed innovation in monster design. - a navy bomb-disposal lieutenant seems to have become an overnight expert in HALO jumps. Because bomb-disposal personnel need to HALO jump a lot.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, the movie features Godzilla and that's nice to see. But other than that it is awful."
"Bayclove","3","4","9","18 May 2014"," Godzilla is 2D experience not worth the cost of 3D or IMAX 3D
","I first saw the Godzilla trailer watching Captain American and thought; OMG, IMAX! I always have a quick peek on IMDb spoiler-free reviews before actually going to see a movie. Having seen all the one stars it made me curious and so I paid for regular 2D instead of IMAX which is actually less than half the price. I am so relieved. Godzilla bombed!<br/><br/>I know you probably liked the trailer as did I. The excitement surrounding this movie is rife. The movie just doesn't cut it though, not by a long shot. It's a marketing gimmick... Godzilla greatest monster malarkey... drama, fighting, action... n to the o - NO!<br/><br/>The trailer is the end. Believe what you read when they say you only see Godzilla for 10 minutes throughout the entire movie. And yes it matters, we paid to see Godzilla after all. A good human story would have been a bonus.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are cleverly cut in that we know the monsters are fighting but they are not played out on screen for us to enjoy. The focus is always put back on the human story, which is weak, boring & forgettable. <br/><br/>You probably feel compelled to watch this movie regardless of what you read here but I would recommend the cheapest ticket as it's likely you will feel a level of disappointment and/or regret. <br/><br/>You get 90% boring human story and 10% Godzilla. Not worth extra cash IMAX, nor 3D. Yet 2D is shown sparsely whilst the others are pushed in our faces. Thank you one star reviewers, I would have been so p'd off. Not simply because I'd have felt robbed but my high expectations of this movie would have been crushed. Somehow I don't care for the price I paid.<br/><br/>This movie is borderline rental. It will make millions only because the trailer tricks us and it's Godzilla, nothing more. Don't believe the hype, it's not real unless I'm missing something.<br/><br/>This movie is 5 at best for special effects and the short time we get some Godzilla action. I have given 3 because it's so minimal.<br/><br/>The movie is overall boring. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading :D"
"danielsteadman99","8","4","9","18 May 2014"," King of the Monsters, King of the Movies
","This film is an absolute masterpiece. Not once did I find myself getting bored or losing track of the plot - something that happens commonly when I watch longer movies - and I was gutted when it was over. Not because I was disappointed, but because I desperately wanted more. Gareth Edwards' film takes monster movies to a whole new level, with some nice twists to the usual ""Godzilla"" story lines, a fantastic cast and some of the best action sequences I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.<br/><br/>The first thing to mention about this film is its cast and its focus on the human characters, played mainly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Lieutenant Ford Brody), Elizabeth Olsen (Elle Brody, Ford's wife), and Bryan Cranston (Joe Brody, Ford's estranged father). Bryan Cranston is only really in the first half, portraying his character as a very outcast, yet very determined former nuclear engineer who is searching for the truth about his wife's tragic death. His theories beautifully foreshadow the events to come, and he drags his son, Ford, right into the heart of the trouble. Thankfully, this means that we get to see lots of the brilliant Aaron Taylor- Johnson, a courageous explosive ordnance disposal technician who comes face-to-face with Godzilla several times. Literally. Aaron Taylor-Johnson really is the star here, and the scenes with his wife, Elle, and son, Sam, before any of the action starts makes his actions later on all the more respectable and courageous as he risks his life to save them and the entire city. Elizabeth Olsen isn't used as much as I would have liked, as she is fantastic in the scenes in which we see her. Having said that, she does appear a fair amount, as the strong wife and mother holding back her terror in order to stay and help. Her scenes with Aaron Taylor- Johnson are great too, and make for some very believable characters. The other main character is Dr Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe), a scientist monitoring Godzilla and the MUTOs. He doesn't really do much apart from look very worried in every shot and say tense or shocking one-liners, but Ken Watanabe makes sure that it's never cringe-worthy or boring.<br/><br/>Secondly we have Gareth Edwards' directing - wow! I need to see more of this guy! Every shot looks as good as it could possibly be, and the first reveal of Godzilla is brilliant (SPOILERS COMING UP). There's a MUTO smashing up an airport. Cue plane exploding, followed by the one to the right, and then the one to the right, and then a foot. Silence. Another foot. Cut to a shot of the MUTO roaring, and then back to the feet. Up the camera pans (for quite a long time!), leaving us with a beautiful high-angle shot of the beast himself. And then comes the roar. There's another great shot of Godzilla making his way across the Pacific to San Francisco, and another in the city itself of well, there's no other way of putting it – Godzilla and a MUTO having a good old' fashioned fistfight, which culminates in a pretty fantastic and well-timed tail slam from the big guy. The skyscrapers don't really bother them. It's just a long shot, and in it we see two giant monsters ripping each other to shreds and obliviously destroying the city below. Another great shot (or shots) is during the HALO jump, as we see the city in flames, the men falling through the clouds and the burning skyline and a close-up of a Godzilla vs MUTO fight.<br/><br/>Now I'll move on to the plot and the headline acts – the MUTOs and the big guy himself, Godzilla. The plot is very straightforward. A MUTO hatches in Japan, one hatches in Nevada next to Las Vegas, and this is all because they've been feeding on humanity's nuclear waste and radiation. Oh, and by the way, the MUTOs look brilliant. Imagine a metal praying mantis crossed with a four-legged spider, as tall as a skyscraper. That's a MUTO. Anyway, Ford joins the fight to stop the creatures, and as they make their way to San Francisco the military plan to destroy them with their most powerful nuclear weapon. Godzilla is closing in too, and when the pesky MUTOs steal the nuke and build their nest around it, Ford and a group of soldiers must go into the city to detonate it. However, Godzilla and the MUTOs are also in the city, smashing everything (including each other) to bits. It's very odd that, for once, we end up cheering Godzilla on, as the two MUTOs begin to overwhelm him as he is seemingly hurt. And then he is actually made out to be the good guy (a twist I enjoyed), as he saves Ford in a spectacular way from a MUTO and the media call him "" the saviour of our city?"". 'Zilla looks amazing too. ""Massive"" is probably an understatement, but the spikes on his back, the battle scars on his body and his terrifying face make him look awesome. Also, his roar had me jumping up and down with excitement, as did his surprise for the MUTOs: his atomic fire breath.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Godzilla"" is one fantastic movie. No longer a mockery, but terrifying, tense, and, unlike many monster movies, it is complex. Complex in that it has multiple characters with interesting back-stories (that are all explored) and gives Godzilla a new personality and purpose. Everything looks great, it feels epic, and I enjoyed every moment. This is a movie that would appeal to anyone, and you have to see it. Godzilla is bigger and better than ever.<br/><br/>Best moment: Godzilla vs the MUTOs - this was the most intense thing I have ever seen."
"evanfitzii-4-85331","7","4","9","18 May 2014"," The movie title should have been ""Muto""
","*****Does Contain Spoilers******** *****Does Contain Spoilers******** *****Does Contain Spoilers******** *****Does Contain Spoilers********<br/><br/>I've been a fan since I was a child and after seeing the reviews on IMDb I couldn't wait to see it.<br/><br/>The story was somewhat interesting at the start with Bryan Cranstons character and his dysfunctional family. But his death was extremely disappointing and left the movie feeling empty having no leverage. I didn't feel anything for his son who was the new main protagonist. This was pretty confusing and left the film feeling without much direction.<br/><br/>Some of my biggest complaints of the movie were Muto's screen time and existence. The film was practically about Godzilla's adversary and less about Godzilla himself. Each time you did get to see him the scene would change to some random people in a building or train or bus and then watch their reactions when disaster strikes. This is frustrating since Muto had so much screen time and he isn't even that impressive. I didn't feel fear or on edge when the hair pin moments played.<br/><br/>The film should have been about, Godzilla's reawakening and threatening destruction of all of mankind which attempts to kill him with new and amazing technology. It would make for a much more convincing story and could ultimately be played out in a eerie tone.<br/><br/>I also felt Godzilla's body looked quite awkward and unconvincing. I know the filmmakers were trying to stay true to the original series and that they did. When it comes to a film thats dedicated to making events realistic I can't really sustain my belief that Godzilla could be mobile or even fight with a body that he has. Some minor changes wouldn't hurt, I cringed the most when it gave a close up of his peg leg looking foot.<br/><br/>Overall the film is visually amazing and impressive but it falls short in many areas and despite the CGI budget I still felt unconvinced in many of the scenes.<br/><br/>I hope this isn't the last American Godzilla remake."
"lukebball93","7","4","9","17 May 2014"," An honest Godzilla fan review
","After my first viewing of the movie, I must say I am satisfied, not only as a movie goer, but more importantly,as a long time fan. Most of the plot points involving the human characters are familiar, but welcomed. Bryan Cranston steals the show in all the scenes he is in. The rest of the characters are fairly simple, with the exception of Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who you can say is an expert in monsters.<br/><br/>The human drama at times does seem to override the action. The movie teases you with action which sometimes can be effective whereas other times you feel sort of robbed. However, the final act is something to be witnessed. There are moments where your jaw may hit the floor.<br/><br/>The most important thing to keep in mind when going to see this movie is that if you are looking for another ""Pacific Rim"" with nothing but senseless action, you will be disappointed. This film is based more in realism and goes back to Godzilla's roots. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is heavy on the drama but still packs a punch, even though you may wish you could get just a little more Godzilla. It is worth every penny. The King of the Monsters is back ladies and gentlemen."

","There is an incident at the nuclear plant in Japan where they both work, and Joe's wife Elle dies. Joe spends the next 15 years labelled as a nutcase, pursuing the truth of what really happened. Then the same thing starts happening and Joe's son Ford, now grown, gets caught up in it.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this. Loved it - no, but enjoyed - certainly. Because there is some terrific stuff here Bryan Cranston, as Joe, is simply wonderful, but won't get recognised because of the type of film this is. Elizabeth Olsen is also terrific, and these two actors give the film the beating heart it needs to avoid simply being a special effects extravaganza (because Aaron ""Kick-Ass"" Taylor-Johnson, as Cranston's son and Olsen's husband, unfortunately, operates merely as a merely cookie-cutter hunk, and offers no emotional weight whatsoever). The effects themselves are terrific, and we finally get a Godzilla which looks like what the man in the rubber suit would look life if the creature he was portraying actually exists.<br/><br/>And there are a number of things which are not so terrific. None is a deal-breaker, but all could have been better.<br/><br/>One, the heart goes out of the film when the effects start. Having established characters who have an emotional stake in what happens, and made us care about them, we hardly see them once the destruction is under way.<br/><br/>Two, Ken Watanabe has little to do except put on an expression which is halfway between awestruck and concerned.<br/><br/>Three, Sally Hawkins - why was she in it, again? (I love Watanabe and Hawkins, by the way: they were wasted, though Juliet Binoche's cameo was classy).<br/><br/>Four, are the US forces really so dumb that they keep using small arms fire against these critters?<br/><br/>Five, are the US forces really so dumb that they keep sending fighter planes against critters that defend themselves by emitting EMPs?<br/><br/>Six, we unfortunately know that collapsing buildings create vast dust clouds. Emulating these dust clouds accurately in a battle which decimates San Francisco, and staging the battle at night, means you don't see what happens clearly.<br/><br/>Seven, the US battle strategy (as regards the bomb) makes little sense.<br/><br/>As a friend of mine observes, though, this is pretty much one of the original Godzilla films but with bang-on special effects. As a result, it can be taken seriously (though not too seriously).<br/><br/>The 3D conversion is poor."
"limoncella-641-42235","8","4","9","15 May 2014"," Godzilla delivers enough, but is it wrong to ask for more?
","Godzilla works, thank goodness. It's suspenseful, exciting, fun and almost everything I could have possibly wanted it to be.<br/><br/>But may I please get some more Godzilla in my Godzilla movie please?<br/><br/>What the movie gains in tension and suspense is sadly lost with a lacklustre delivery of the guy we all came to see, I just don't think Godzilla appears enough throughout the film to justify calling the movie ""Godzilla"".<br/><br/>Godzilla appears mostly in moments intended to make fans ""squee"" and I can see now why these were the scenes they played at festivals to promote the movie.<br/><br/>Also it appears that much of the storytelling is delivered with a lot of labour, everything has to be explained in detail removing a lot of the mystery and intrigue behind the monsters. Also making the dark-super- serious Godzilla almost feels redundant because it's impossible to escape the series' shlocky B-Movie origins. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards was one of the best choices to direct this movie and he has a distinct eye for little moments amidst scenes of big scope, but by focusing on the humans instead of Godzilla most of the time it cheapens the spectacle and it feels very disappointing.<br/><br/>It is good movie, and i'm recommending it highly for what it gets right, but I must emphasize the lack of Godzilla in Godzilla."
"YJLcool","8","4","9","15 May 2014"," Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that truly delivers
","After the failed 1998 version of Godzilla, a Jurassic Park ripoff (there are many scenes lifted shot-for-shot from Jurassic Park) which nearly destroyed the franchise by making the titled monster looked nothing more than a giant iguana with spikes, Hollywood decided to make another American reboot again for the well-known Japanese pop-culture icon. The Japanese hated the 1998 version so much that they named the Iguana monster as 'Zilla', without 'god' and they even have a film (Godzilla: Final Wars) where 'Zilla' get blown to bits by the real Godzilla. So, this time, does it truly deliver? YES.<br/><br/>From the menacing look...the thunderous roar...the humongous 107m (350ft) size...the trademark back plates...the gargantuan tail whip...the signature atomic breath...Godzilla is a word taken from 'Gojira', a combination of two Japanese words: gorira (""gorilla"")and kujira (""whale""), implying his enormous size, power and aquatic origin.<br/><br/>The newly-designed Godzilla is more faithful to its Japanese origins, done with Hollywood's state-of-art CGI effects (instead of a man-in-suit costume). The film respects of the monster's dark nuclear roots by showing the nuclear tests done in the past as attempts to kill it (although it enhanced the creature, making it bigger, powerful and stronger than before).<br/><br/>The film done a great job in portraying the monsters, showing them as animals that tries to survive, trying to do what it takes to defend their territories or reproduce. The CGI was really good and the shots of godzilla or the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) appearing on screen were nothing short of incredible. The film chooses to hold back the Kaiju battles until the end and gradually reveal Godzilla's body parts (the spiky back plates in the Pacific, the gigantic tail, the stomping foot, the massive chest, etc) from various human viewpoint camera angles before making his full appearance.<br/><br/>While many would think this might cause frustration for the impatient ones, but this is not the case. The film gave us several breathtaking closer shots of the MUTOs to keep us entertained before the big guy comes in. It builds up the anticipation for the climax. At the same time, these shots give us a sense of scale, an understanding of monsters' massive sizes before the climatic battle begins. Otherwise, an overexposure of monsters earlier in the film might leave the audience feel exhausted and develop repetitive feeling of scenes as the film progresses. I was genuinely awestruck during the moment when godzilla first appears on-screen, stomping on buildings and makes his first roar.<br/><br/>The monsters remain as the central story that ties many of the human characters together in the film. Gone are the silly, cheesy acting, lame humor, and tone of the 1998 version. The level of seriousness in the film gives the sense of urgency and danger for events that about to happen. First, we get to see the Ford family and how the existence of these monsters affect their lives, the research team that tries to understand the creatures behaviour, the Navy troops that tries to stop these creatures from wiping out the entire human race. These stories works together as a functional narrative that connects all the pieces (although it feels contrived and too convenient at some point).<br/><br/>The acting was good. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche and Elizabeth Olsen all provide decent performances in their respective roles. Bryan Cranston delivered a brilliant on-screen performance despite his limited screen time in the film. However, Aaron Taylor- Johnson's character does fall a bit flat and it's a shame that he has most of the screen time compared to the rest of the casts.<br/><br/>Overall, Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that delivers. The climatic battle in San Francisco is truly rewarding and worth the wait, it left me wanting for more.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-godzilla.html Rating: 8/10"

The first one, Gojira, was definitely the best one and after seeing this new one, Gojira is still my favourite but this new film is my second.<br/><br/>I loved the design and look of this Godzilla, makes the film look a lot more serious than the 'lizard' from Broderick version and from the older Japanese versions.<br/><br/>This is a lot more believable; it's something that you could see possibly happen (much like Sharknados according to Tara Reid!).<br/><br/>There are some amazing shots throughout the film of Godzilla and just general action and scenery shots. I did like that it wasn't until later in the film that you actually got a good decent shot of Godzilla, most of the others were just headshots or were clouded in smoke.<br/><br/>When I was in the cinema and saw Godzilla's tail start to light up wow! I'm pretty sure my fanboy sequel was heard worldwide!!<br/><br/>I did feel that this movie didn't need the big names or even the character stories in the film.

"ianquiksilver","1","3","6","24 April 2016"," Godzilla, the savior of humanity
","This movie is sadly a big pile of rubbish. I like actions movies, and oddly enough I also like (super) Monster movies as well, but this just turns out to be one more of those movies where the entire focus is put into making nice effects and cool 3D but where the rest of the movie, like actual plot and development suffer greatly. <br/><br/>(spoiler alert) They claim at first that post WW2 nuclear testing was actually an attempt at killing Godzilla, yet they never explain how that battle ends, or how they got Godzilla ""to go away"", clearly they didn't obliterate it since it magically comes back to life, apparently without any trace of memory of the fact that humans tried to nuke it.<br/><br/>After MUTO first hatches and flies away, the US Navy states the obvious, that they need to 'find it', one would think it not too hard considering its size and human's relatively competent surveillance and searching capabilities (satellites) added to the fact that MUTO kills all electronics around it (can't be too hard locating elements on the grid suddenly going off-line, following an obvious geographical logic, as in, it travels, most likely away from the point of origin, not to mention it's highly radioactive).<br/><br/>Godzilla suddenly becomes not the monster everyone fears, but the equalizer of the natural order, his existence being only justifiable as being the counter-force to MUTO's. So when MUTO magically appeared many years ago, did Godzilla as well? Why was Godzilla the only monster around during the nuclear testing 'past'? Or did the egg-laying MUTO just manage to stay below radar before disappearing into thin air?<br/><br/>In this 'aim', to destroy the MUTO's, Godzilla just casually becomes humans' ""natural"" ally, he lets ships cruise next to him without disturbance, he goes the extra mile to avoid any human casualties, such as diving under boats in his way instead of straight through as one would expect, he even protects innocent people on a bridge by inserting himself between it and a wall of ill-fired airborne missiles and the way in which he finally takes care of the MUTO's to then leave, was done in a way to insinuate he was protecting the humans and nature of the dangers of over-sized, nuclear monsters.<br/><br/>In the filming, most of the focus is set not on the monsters, but rather as seen through the eyes of the terrified humans. We feel cheated at times, when Godzilla first meets and confronts a MUTO, we can only see it through snippets from News channels and the ruins the day after (instead of showing you what actually happened, they figured you'd just have to imagine it yourself, fill in the blanks). We don't care to see how panicked people get, we want to see monsters going at each other!<br/><br/>Oh, and to show some ""deepness"", the symbolism of the son becoming an anti-bomb guy, wow, now that's profound thinking. <br/><br/>A complete and utter flop!"

It is so intense and fun to watch the destruction and kaiju battles going on with great human characters as well. The plot is great as well as the fight scenes. People complain about not enough monster action but there is more monster action than movies like alien or cloverfield. Bryan Cranston is great even if he dies early on but Aaron Taylor Johnson makes up for that as the main character in the film. There are themes of drama, family, apocalypse, and some suspense and horror. But it makes you wonder, what if this was really happening... But overall it's a amazing film you should buy it because you won't want to watch it just once!"
"mjleeming-38404","1","3","6","6 April 2015"," Top 10 most stupid moments/facts about this movie
","10. In the beginning of the movie they go into the dangerous tunnels wearing suits that can't protect them even if a breach happens and they know an earthquake is luring and go in anyway. (But someone needed to die to right) 9. For 15 years Joe is looking for the answer to why his wife died, what caused the earthquake, the day he finds the answer, he really didn't have a clue what is was all about but he convinced those who did, that it was more dangerous than they thought, but it is too late! Great timing btw. (that is the pentalty for not figuring out a pattern for 15 years right) 8. Joe runs to protect his son, he doesn't succeed and gets fatally injuired trying to find him, he then dies on the helicopter talking to his son and dies without having any impact on the movie, as the pattern he had figured out really doesn't matter much for the rest of the movie. (But he convinced his son to protect his family right? NOT) 7. The Human race are completely stupid in this movie, they know the monsters can generator large EMP explosions, but they fly close to them with military jets. (Creating great scenes of planes falling out of the skies silently right!) 6. The military have no clue about the bomb they want to use on the monsters, but luckily the only man in from another military unit, Ford, happens to meet up with them and knows alle about the bomb, his is the hero forgetting about his family, even though he has no influence on the outcome of it all. 5. With or without the bomb along side of him, Ford seems to attrack the monsters as if he was radioactive man, in the monorail he happens to end up with a mute kid, which gives him more non needed purpose to do his hero thing and makes it even harder to ""fight"" the monsters, while protecting the kid at the same time (maybe because no one really cares what happens to Ford, but everyone wants to protect the kid right?) 4. Fords son is sent on a schoolbus that drives kids to safety on the other side of the golden gate bridge, the military knew the monsters were getting closer, but never closed the bridge, the bus luckily drives away before the bridge is cut in half, and in the end Fords son is magically back where all the action happens, even though the bridge is destroyed and godzilla is still in the city. (But how else would they reunite the Brody family right!) 3. Godzilla gets really mad and kills the first monster by hitting it into a building, wwf style, then grabs the other monster like it was a fish in the sea and blows the crap out of it. ( now godzilla is the all mighty superhero of earth, a giveaway early on as everyone else are plain stupid and helpless right!) 2. There are no spoilers to write about this movie, there are no surprises to ruin, there are no important human facts or human facts that make a point, and no heart to make you feel the least affected by the kaos. 1. The must stupid fact about the movie, is how anyone can allow it to get beyond 5 stars here on IMDb, that sadly makes the human race even more stupid than the human race in the movie itself."
"leonblackwood","6","3","6","1 November 2014"," Really needed some decent actors! 6/10
","Review: I'm in 2 minds about this film! For a 2 hour film, you don't really see that much of Godzilla until near the end and the big showdown at the end was a bit difficult to work out. I liked the intense drama throughout the movie but the director got rid of the decent actors really early in the movie so your left with these B actors who look puzzled and confused most of the time. It really needed someone like Will Smith or Channing Tatum who could have brought some wit and action to the main character. The sets looked amazing and realistic, especially when the director pans out so you can see the total destruction of the city, but I was really disappointed with the corny ending. In all, it's a watchable movie which is entertaining and we'll put together, but they really need to get some decent actors if there going to come out with a sequel. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: The main character, whose played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is mostly known for the Kick- Ass franchise so he was a weird choice for such a massive film. Personally I don't think that he was the right choice because he didn't really bring that much emotion to his character but thats just me being picky. Bryan Cranston played his father well and he brought some intensity to his role, especially when he was watching his wife through the door (trying not to spoiler), but there wasn't any other actors that stood out in the film. With all the attention to detail on the scenery, I wasn't that impressed with the look of Godzilla. He looked very plastic/rubbery which was surprising for this day and age. Anyway, it's definitely an epic movie which will look brilliant on a big screen and sound great with massive speakers, and judging by the movies takings, this is definitely a concept which will always be popular with Godzilla fans.<br/><br/>Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $525million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there epic movies about Godzilla taking on some nasty creatures. 6/10"
"bumologist","5","3","6","7 September 2014"," Too much soldiering and bad casting on top of it.
","I hated the 1998 movie, and I really wanted to like this one, but I just couldn't do it. I thought the casting was fine, except the main character, Ford, was badly cast and was used way too much. Just too much ""soldiering"" in general. I really have no clue why he was chosen, there had to be someone better available. I felt like they went wrong with the way they ""exposed"" the mutos and Godzilla too. I think a better way would have had the first Muto tear up Japan, with Godzilla showing up just a little too late, and maybe show the Muto flying away, with Godzilla watching, and then turning around, and start heading for Hawaii. A CNN anchor could have been shown saying, ""What the hell is that thing?"". In the meantime, have Muto #2 come out, and SHOW it trashing Vegas, then go back to Hawaii, where ""round 1"" of the Godzilla/Muto fights happens, with Godzilla beating up the Muto pretty badly, and then having the military screw him up by lobbing shells at him, and the Muto gets away, and heads for the US mainland. Godzilla heads for Frisco, while Muto #2 and then Muto #1 screw around, totally trashing the city, laying their eggs, etc, along with destroying the Navy pretty easily with a lot of stuff blowing up. About the time they finished off the military, Godzilla shows up and the big finale happens, with a similar outcome to what happens in the movie that was actually made. I think just cutting the Ford screen time alone would have made a better movie. Putting a better actor in the Ford part would have, too. If the Godzilla/Muto fights could have been done better, in an escalating way, it would have pretty much erased all the negatives of the Ford character and all the ""soldiering"", but it didn't. All in all, a disappointment."
"Ratisbonanza","2","3","6","1 September 2014"," King of the Monsters, savior of our city? Or 9/11 as monster version with good outcome?
","That is the end line of the movie, and it's as ridiculous as the movie itself. Well, what happens? Some strange ""anomalies"" in Japan some 15 years ago, climaxing in the rebirth of Muto(s), then Godzilla appearing on the scene fighting the Mutos, some US military efforts to stop them and the usual ""hero"" who miraculously seems to be everywhere where it counts, but who is in fact a completely blood less guy. Ah, and two big movie stars in neglectable roles, Binoche with three minutes, Strathairn maybe with twice the screen time. This movie really seems like 9/11 as monster story with good outcome, Godzilla being the ""god"" that saves the people. Of course, again tons of US military and the Mutos do appear in the USA, where else. This movie is Hollywood CGI trash with no real story, lacking characters (neither the main character nor anyone else is developing, Watanabe just looks shocked and curious, alternately), just packs (again for movies of such type) everything and every cliché in the story, be it every conceivable action or scenes like family reunion and lost little kids and has no chance against Godzilla from 1998. This version may not hold on to the original, but it's still better, with some funny moments and good actors. The 2014 version has nothing, I really mean nothing to offer."
"rzajac","7","3","6","26 August 2014"," Kinda ""Plan 9""ish... but still enjoyable.
","I really would like to know why this flick is earning scads of IMDb ratings below 3! I guess I'll do a survey of the comments and look for a commonality.<br/><br/>One thing for sure: There *is* a sort of ""Plan 9"" feel to the plot lead-up. It was beginning to look like we'd be left high/dry with respect to a binding mythos that lends credence to the concept. And then we finally get to the scene at Monarch where things sorta start to get explained; but it sounded a bit hollow, to me; like the alien fellow's speech in Plan 9 about why alien intelligence urgently needed to intervene in Earth matters. Yeah, it made a sort of sense, but... not really. They try to palm Cranston's character off as one of those crackpots-who-knew-all-along, but in the end it doesn't gel. You get the distinct feeling that Cranston's character was supposed to be tragic; but sadly, due to thematic mismanagement, he comes off as a bit pathetic.<br/><br/>Now, I've never been a monster aficionado: As a kid, I tended to get scared easily, and wouldn't watch monster flicks, even while my buddies loved 'em. So I'm trying to play catch-up here. But I sense that the key to making a flick like this work is to skip the pretenses to high-toned theatrics and go for the gut: Create a visceral sense of power and primal, atavistic, animal angst. I really don't understand, in the least, all the commenter remonstrations to the effect that there's not enough monster action. There's plenty, plenty, plenty of very tastefully choreographed monster action in this flick; and it's powerful, primal, angry... all that!<br/><br/>So, in the end, I give this guy a 7: It's not timeless art, but the producers, et.al. sought to paint a very big picture, and a big picture is delivered. For that, alone, it deserves more than the weird reprisal ratings it's been receiving."
"drtrepanator","5","3","6","26 August 2014"," God damn
","I wont waste much words on this film, most of it has already been said. It starts really promising, the atmosphere is great in the beginning, and then they kill the most interesting character and they turn it into this mindless classical American, Hollywood idiotic thing. Such a shame.<br/><br/>I must express my deepest regret, that thanks to THIS, we probably wont see any other Godzilla film nowhere in near future, which is a shame, because i really like that monster.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie 5 stars only because i want to see more of Godzilla films. But not like this.<br/><br/>P.s. to designers, there is no need to make a fat Godzilla, they made it that way back in the days, because it was a man in a suit, now there is no need for that, u have that bloody CGI (which was quite nice i must say in few brief scenes)."
"siderite","6","3","6","10 August 2014"," Godzilla times 3
","Third time is a charm, right? Wrong! In this film everything that makes Godzilla is being turned upside down and transformed into a propaganda movie for the American way of life. How can a Japanese icon created as a metaphor for the nuclear threat become the symbol of the USA supremacy? Spin away!<br/><br/>First the monsters are ancient predators from when the Earth was radioactive, so it is not the fault of humans for their existence and any such responsibility is voided. In fact, the Bikini atoll nuclear tests were purposeful in attempting to destroy one of these monsters. Also, the creatures don't spread radioactivity, in fact they feed off it. Just put a monster egg near Fukushima and the radioactivity will magically vanish. Godzilla is actually there to preserve balance, like some kind of ancient giant Avatar: when two monsters wake up from their slumber and decide to procreate in San Francisco, Godzilla comes to the rescue and fights them both, then goes back home.<br/><br/>Second, the entire decision process rests solely in the hands of the American military, even when they were in Japan. They simply come and take control. The news are all American and the trek of two giant monsters moving from Japan to San Francisco is just an afterthought that happens in a few minutes. The hero is a US soldier, conveniently son of a scientist obsessed with these monsters and, almost naturally, married to a medical nurse and having a small child whose only purpose is to look cute and ask for his mommy.<br/><br/>So other than the monster fights, which are kind of boring with some exceptions, and the rather silly quest of this one guy to get to San Francisco to his family instead of telling them to get out, you get epic music, military music, motivational music, military propaganda, derision of science, arrested Americans demanding things, even some Christian prayers and lots and lots of gung-ho soldiers firing ineffective weapons at skyscraper size monsters.<br/><br/>Oh, and in the end, after entire cities are devastated, which involves hundreds of thousands dead, a lot of respiratory related diseases in the making, Godzilla is applauded for the service it performed to restore balance.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a complete failure from multiple standpoints: storyline, script, actor charisma, acting quality, soundtrack, logic, even action scenes. I mean can you believe that the most noticeable character for me was Elizabeth Olsen, just because she was looking nice and that was her entire role anyway? The only reason I don't rate this film lower is because of the trailers. Now those were great!"

","This visually stunning blockbuster is Hollywood's second attempt at cashing in on the success of the greatest film monster ever know... Godzilla!<br/><br/>As we all know, the 90's version was hilarious for all the wrong reasons and should have actually black listed Hollywood from ever being allowed to do remakes ever again.<br/><br/>Mind you, that should have happened with the 80's cartoon of Godzilla...<br/><br/>So here we are again, with the finest in CGI and all in the hands of new director Gareth Edwards who shot to fame with his indie hit, Monsters.<br/><br/>Personally, Monsters bored the sh*t out of me and it took me a number of years to get through it without turning it off after 20 minutes. The problem I found with that, seems to have drifted in to this, and that is where lies the failure.<br/><br/>Focused more on the human side and drama of his stories, Edwards fails to recognise that Godzilla is the hero, the titular character, and above all, the star of any Godzilla movie.<br/><br/>This in turn leaves us with a beautifully made film about the US army (yay) who take on alien creatures intent on destroying the planet (or the US at least).<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and there is a cameo by Godzilla."

","Finally went to see ""Gojira"" and was left disappointed. The negative reviews of this movie were pretty accurate.<br/><br/>Bland characters. Bland script. Big budget, Hollywoodized, clichéd, story that doesn't quite deliver.<br/><br/>By the way.... where's Godzilla? Imagine seeing the Transformers movie and only getting glimpses of them throughout the movie until the end. Or not seeing King Kong until he's finally in the big city.<br/><br/>The movie tried so hard to be something, but ultimately just didn't get there.<br/><br/>Awesome visuals, and when Godzilla finally DOES get into the game full throttle, it was pretty awesome.

"HellspawnAlice","5","3","6","11 June 2014"," How can they title this Godzilla?
","Although this remake of Godzilla was a significant improvement over the 1998 film, it still was a disappointment. I will start with the positives:<br/><br/>1) Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe... need I say more? 2) The CGI was beautiful! It was some of the best monsters I have ever seen. Godzilla looked the best he ever has. <br/><br/>Yes, the list is pretty short for the positives. So now the negatives:<br/><br/>1) Other than Cranston and Watanabe, the acting was just awful. Some dialogues just made me cringe. But overall, it is a Godzilla movie; so how much acting is really needed? That brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>2) Where was Godzilla through most of the movie? He is hardly in the movie at all. And when he is about to battle some monsters (I will hold back their names as to not give anything away), the film goes back to unnecessary character development. Then once these useless scenes are over, it goes back to the city to show it absolutely destroyed. The monster battles were the best parts of Godzilla movies. Why would they cut these out entirely?<br/><br/>3) The food source of the monsters was absolutely ridiculous. I think this was just an attempt to bring the movie back to the US. Stop trying to Americanize films and just film them where they rightly should occur. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie was incredibly boring due to the excessive character development that was absolutely unnecessary. I never cared about any of the characters. And for a movie about Godzilla, he is only in it for about 10 minutes of the two hours. What a waste."
"alindsay-al","7","3","6","4 June 2014"," A solid start to a new potential franchise
","I have never seen the previous Godzilla film but from the trailers I saw this quickly became one of my most anticipated films of the year and even though this film didn't live up to those expectations this is a solid good film. This film stars Bryan Cranston who lives to find out what the scientists are hiding from an accident in the past, this ends up with the King of monsters Godzilla in a huge encounter for the Earth. Now even though the trailers clearly show Bryan Cranston as the lead character and even though he has the most emotional scenes, best acting and best lines in the film he is not the main character but just a supporting character. The lead is actually Aaron-Taylor Johnson and he may be the most boring protagonist of all time as just an average soldier and his wife Elizabeth Olsen's character is no better and just as dull in the film. A good side character is Ken Watanabe's character who provides the exposition for the film and good at doing it. The script doesn't really help these actors and the fact that this film focuses on the soldiers instead of the monsters. However, where this film really gets its style right Godzilla has never been better and he looks better then ever and also his adversaries are also extremely cool. The world that Director Gareth Edwards has created a beautiful looking world which I want to be continued. This film is the ultimate tease and only the action towards the end make up for it and with this awesome action scene that truly saves the film and makes it the really good film that it is. This film has it's problems but I believe they can be fixed easily and hopefully the sequel fixes these and adds to the action to really create a great franchise."
"zetordie","6","3","6","2 June 2014"," IMAX saved this movie
","First of all, this movie's target audience are the classic Godzilla fans, not the '98 Godzilla. I for one liked the '98 Godzilla, but I watched this one at IMAX and all I can say is that the CGI scenes were absolutely awesome, featured by ""ear-candy"" sound effects. I'd watch those scenes again, maybe even on a flat screen, but nothing more of this movie. Yeah, the plot sucked hard, and yeah, the acting was pretty low, but if I wanted an overall good movie I would have watched one in the comfort of my home, or on a regular 2D cinema screen. But, let's be honest, why would I want to watch Godzilla unless it's on a big IMAX screen? That's what the movie was made for. <br/><br/>I give 4/10 to the whole movie, but given the visual and audio experience on a relatively reduced amount of movie time, I'd go for 6/10; could have rated more if at least the fight scenes were longer and not so teasing."

","I'm not usually one to leave reviews under the circumstances I enjoy a film, as I would opine it makes more sense to leave them as a means of informing others of films that aren't worth their time, but, I feel compelled to make an exception for this film due to how overly stigmatized it is without sufficient criteria. I'll admit that I had prevised this to be another gimmicky, Michael Bay-esque train wreck upon viewing the trailers, yet, it seemed to maintain a reasonably engaging story along with convincing pseudo-science to explain the presence of the monsters in the first place.<br/><br/>I would, however, opine that the character development was very lack-luster and the settings throughout the events of the film were void of any novelty whatsoever (I'm not quibbling about the fact that it takes place in Tokyo, I'm referring to the actual infrastructure and microcosmic settings throughout the film).<br/><br/>So, in short, while it's nothing Kubrick and Spielberg would be groveling over, I would say that it's worth a view."

","Godzilla is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a very talented cast.I think it is definitely the beginning of a great franchise,but this movie had a few flaws that definitely bothered me.A huge problem what that the dialogue was a that very lazy,especially from Ken Watanabe's character,he is a great actor so the problem is not him,it was the awful dialogue his character was given,he says basically every line in this movie with no passion because the lines he was given are ridiculous.My biggest problem however was Bryan Cranston (spoiler ahead),in the trailers he is made out to be the main character,it fact I thought of this movie more as a Bryan Cranston movie with Godzilla than a Godzilla movie with Bryan Cranston,because that's really how the trailers made it seem,and I was looking forward to see him become the main character of a new big franchise after Breaking Bad,but the trailers were a complete lie,because his character dies in the first twenty minutes,and we are left to follow Aaron Taylor Johnson for the rest of the movie,who is good but you just don't care about his character as much as you do for Cranston,and the fact he died really bothered me for the whole movie.Other than that,Godzilla and the other monsters look fantastic,the effects are ground breaking,you won't believe he isn't real for a second.The monster fights are outstanding and are certainly the best part of the movie.It certainly has it flaws,but Godzilla is still a fun and action packed summer movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good action and adventure film. <br/><br/>The world and it's very existence is threatened by giant monsters attacking several cities,and Godzilla is the only one who can stop them. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bryan Cranston Worst Performance: Ken Watanabe"
"kyle-domination","7","3","6","27 May 2014"," A magnificent, ambitious and often astonishing epic let down by minor clichés.
","Since the awful disappointment of the 90's remake of Godzilla, the arrival of a new and more refined version stimulated a great deal of anticipation in me! The new trailer was expertly made, I was very, very excited. After months of speculation from my family, I finally got the chance to see it. What a clichéd, delightful surprise. In all honesty, Godzilla lived up to its expectations. Making a B-movie into a more realistic film is a hard job but director Gareth Edwards delivers a satisfying disaster movie that only some audiences, including myself, will fully appreciate. It's superior, reputable and full-out epic but it's greatness also turns into it's weakness. Clichés. Almost every film in the modern world accept clichés into it's script and this is one of them. Godzilla rightfully tries to avoid the garbage clichés but fails to contain them through it's love story between Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford and Elizabeth Olson's Elle. Their performances are respectable, they are fine but Bryan Cranston, who is famous for brilliantly portraying Walter White in television series Breaking Bad, steals the show as Joe Brody, the father figure who is shown obsessed with how mysterious signs of Godzilla's presence have appeared. Joe tries to study the signs along with the Japanese guy in Inception, and the story unfolds. In the story, astonishing surprises unfold and sadly I cannot continue to explain the story with spoiling it! To put it in words, it is unexpected and actually quite clever. Through it's surprises, Godzilla's power is unleashed and the film turns into an action- fest, without showing all the destruction it actually can. It avoids it, but the ending has plenty of it. Having said, I admired its ending because really the film is a guilty pleasure, like Pacific Rim. It was made for people's entertainment and it is easily recognisable in Edwards' direction. The devastating lizard / dinosaur / crocodile / dragon has plenty of astonishing action. Godzilla kicking butt is definitely a guilty pleasure to watch. I would, however, liked to have seen it in IMAX 3D. It think the experience would be even more admirable. This is because the visuals in Godzilla are incredible, Godzilla is a breathtaking beast! At times, you actually root for Godzilla to wreak havoc, you'll understand when you watch the film. The suspense is also really well executed.<br/><br/>Pros and Cons:<br/><br/>+ Fantastic Godzilla action + Unexpected, cleverly executed story elements + Bryan Cranston's bombshell performance + Great visuals + Brilliant suspense - An acquired taste for some audiences - Expected clichés - Human characterisation doesn't fully pay off<br/><br/>In all, Godzilla is both questionable and astonishing. For the full experience, go and see it in IMAX.<br/><br/>Verdict = 8 out of 10."

","It starts off medium paced with a tragic event that sort of gears the audience for what will be a roller coaster ride of events leading from one twist to another. I felt the movie met all my expectations of what a Godzilla movie should be. There weren't any WOW moments other than the moment when Godzilla shoots fire from his mouth. I felt most of the movie was aimed towards the other two monsters, rather than Godzilla himself. I believe the other two got more screen time. Overall, I am happy I got to see this Godzilla. The 1998 Godzilla had a better overall story line, and Godzilla was more involved in the 1998 film than this one. But I cannot say I am upset with the films production, and it's nice to see New York City make it through a city destruction film for a change. <br/><br/>Godzilla was larger than life on the screen, and I was pleased with how amazing he looked, and especially the fire breathing attack he used. This film has me screaming ""Godzilla!!!"" Hope there is a sequel to follow. <br/><br/>Met my expectation, didn't exceed a whole lot. I got what I paid for, good movie."

","If only they had killed Bryan Cranston's son instead of Cranston this movie could have been redeemed. Aside from Cranston the entire cast is terrible. The token Japanese guy just gives onerous glares as if he just ate a week old burrito each time someone calls his name. The distraught wife is a complete waste and not necessary at all to the plot. Hey moron, why don't you leave your LG phone on vibrate while your husband is in peril across the world?<br/><br/>This movie has more plot holes and inconsistencies than I have ever seen. One of my favorites... after more than half of San Francisco is reduced to rubble they pan the camera into an office building. Everyone is quietly at their desk working away as calm as grazing cattle while buildings collapse outside their window. Hahaha. My other favorite is putting a nuclear missile on a slow moving train while a giant insect who can detect nuclear material from across the globe is roaming around in the same state. Another thing i didn't understand, why do the soldiers walk around buildings as if they're in Fallujah avoiding taliban? You guys are safe to plod around without checking corners, I think if Godzilla or those muto things are nearby you'll know it. There are numerous holes like this in the movie which have been already discussed but these are my favorites.<br/><br/>It is really sad that the movie started off incredibly for the first 30 minutes and then just collapsed along with the bridge on which Cranston met his demise. I give 5 stars for Cranston and the special effects. Negative 5 for the horrific acting, ultra weak plot, and glaring inconsistencies."

","I love movies with good CGI and sci fi in general, so I was really looking forward to seeing Godzilla. I was somewhat disappointed for three reasons: <br/><br/>1. Although the quality of visual effects was very high the monsters didn't look real, they were all black and some looked metallic. The movie would be more watchable if the monsters had more colours and texture.<br/><br/>2. It is a good cast with good actors, but I blame the director for not pushing them to display emotions. Except Cranston all other main characters had the same plain facial expression even when they saw a monster for the first time. No change in facial expression to show astonishment and fear. Aaron and Elizabeth always had the same expression no matter what was happening to or around them, they looked like they were trying to read a restaurant menu.<br/><br/>3. Overall it didn't feel like one-flow movie and lacked suspense. It felt like a patchwork.<br/><br/>Im giving it 7/7 because of good quality special effects and that I watched in d-box, which made the experience more entertaining and less boring."
"WheelzFourReelz","8","3","6","20 May 2014"," The awesomeness is strong with this one.
","I have been anticipating Godzilla since the beginning of the year. The trailers just looked so awesome! So today I saw it. Here's what I thought of it. You already know what the plot of this movie is. A giant monster comes to the city and wrecks stuff. And in this adaptation we have Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. In this movie, Bryan Cranston plays an engineer who has suspicions that the government is hiding stuff. What will he discover? If you're guess is Godzilla, then you are correct! Honestly, I found the story in this movie to be kind of forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was fine, especially with this source material, but nothing really stood out. Within the story, I mean. With everything else that's a completely different ball park. Let's start with the performances. First off, Bryan Cranston was awesome. You all knew he would be awesome. Even the people that thought the trailer looked stupid probably thought he was going to be awesome. And he is. However, he isn't in the movie very much. It kind of feels like he's shoehorned into the movie so that they could get more people into the theater, but I didn't really mind that much. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the absolute main character in this film (besides Godzilla, of course). He does a pretty good job in this movie. Some people might think his delivery is a little emotionless and dry, but I thought it suited his character well. He's a military soldier who had to fight in some pretty tough wars. He's not going to be all drama filled. The cinematography is impeccable. Everything was shot so well it feels like you're actually there. And that helps the fantastic special effects. Godzilla and the other monsters in this movie just look so awesome. One of the things that I like this movie is that it focuses one the humans. It is about Godzilla, yes, but it follows the journey of the humans. It's like The Walking Dead. Zombies are in the movie, but it's not about the zombies. It's about the people in the show (and no I've never seen The Walking Dead but I really do want to). While this is a good thing, I wish Godzilla was in the movie more. When you seem him he's cool, but I want to see his coolness more. That's my one true negative to this movie. The first two-thirds or so of this movie is build up. It's a little slow, but it's necessary and it works in this movie's favor. And then, when that last third hits, HOLY FREAKING COW! This movie becomes so awesome! It's intense, it's exciting, its action packed, it makes nerds across the world have an orgasm! Who on earth could not think the end of this movie is awesome!?!? The fight scene at the end of this movie that will make so many jaws just drop right to the floor. And mine did a good deal of that fight. Overall, this was a great movie. While I found the story to be forgettable and the lack of Godzilla to be problems, I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you want some intense monster fight scenes, then you need to see this movie. If you couldn't watch the beginning because you thought it was too slow, just wait. I thought this movie was awesome and I can't wait so see it again."
"FilmMuscle","6","3","6","20 May 2014"," Half Effective Disaster Film, Half Monsters-fighting Nerds' Movie
","Monster movies have been around since the dawn of Hollywood, but it's only now that they're gradually transforming into superhero movies as well because—as you all know—we're facing a drought of those. In this case, Godzilla starts off as a terrific tense disaster film that actually forced my mouth open at one point. The film cleverly keeps the first hour mysterious, refraining from showing too much of the monster or its background. Nerdy Godzilla fanboys might be complaining, but it's a very wise decision that definitely maximizes the impact of its first appearance. In fact, the movie started resembling 2005's King Kong and the Jurassic Park series with its initial reluctance to delve straight into the monster's destruction. <br/><br/>Instead, we're introduced to the narrative's main characters and how they all tie into the big picture. Now, some might be underwhelmed by the ""dullness"" of these characters as some critics noted, but a 2-hour film that's predominantly focusing on a daunting creature can only do so much. It can stretch out to be 3 hours and both develop its characters and primary monster like King Kong (2005) did, but you all would still be whining. In my opinion, most of the actors do a good job with the material they're provided to work with—Bryan Cranston, as usual, showing his A-game and starting to separate himself from his famous role as Heisenberg. The film's concentration on its characters in the first half also allows for effective scenes that lead to the deaths of fairly significant individuals. As a result, the audiences are thus able to feel the danger of the whole situation with the establishment of greater suspense for the later acts on whether or not a certain character might die in a particular sequence. <br/><br/>The tone, in large part, retains grittiness and a dark, hopeless aura sets in, which thankfully means moviegoers won't have to deal with forced humor throughout as we all know the mandate for summer blockbusters usually demands. With that being said, yes, this movie is an exceptional Godzilla film that intelligently builds the behemoth up for his first (chilling) appearance and from that moment on, all havoc is unleashed. Destruction befalls on every major city and millions of citizens perish underneath the rubble—everything that also makes for a fine disaster film at its foundation. Like I earlier mentioned, there are some highly tense, blood-curdling segments indeed, and in addition, a group of innocent kids are occasionally seen in the middle of it, thereby further fueling viewers' apprehension. <br/><br/>On the other hand, no, Godzilla isn't perfect because it still suffers from its fair share of flaws as a film. First of all, Aaron Taylor Johnson, definitely the lead of the film, somehow persistently maintains his composure and remains reserved like a standard tough guy even when colossal monsters near to such a close distance that they can very well devour him in the split of a second. Seriously, I'd be screaming my lungs out, but of course, only the females in the movie are shrieking. For some reason, the kids in most films stereotypically gasp at some ""cool"" real-life action rather than crying for mommy and daddy. What?! I don't think that's how real adolescents behave. A lot of the kids in this film simply stare at all the horrific chaos with a demeanor of amazement, wowing at the sight of explosions in close proximity. It's a very superficial display of reality, as is usual with Hollywood blockbusters, in the midst of a story that's otherwise attempting to portray terror through reasonable realism. <br/><br/>And then, I really have to ask: is Godzilla just King Kong 2.0? Herein, we're supposed to feel sympathy for the Brobdingnagian force because he's yet another superhero who breathes florescent fire and extricates humans from other scary monsters. Along the vein of popular superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man, he immediately comes to the rescue whenever there's any hint of a notable character in jeopardy. With or without the gargantuan monster's aid, some characters are still conveniently spared from immense danger even though everyone else around them is essentially doomed. <br/><br/>See, what occurs in the movie that first posed as a despairing disaster film of monumental proportions is a noticeable tonal shift in its last act. It's decently realistic and gloomy at first only to suddenly reshape into a Pacific Rim 2.0, offering us a few grandiose Kaiju battles. Given the fact that I haven't seen the original Godzilla pictures, I entered the theater hoping that this would turn out to be a ""humans versus Godzilla"" movie, but that would ultimately mean unstoppable obliteration. The filmmakers basically took the easy route out and ensured the security of a happy ending. After all has been said and done, I believe a recommendation for this film would be fair as its first hour and a half is nicely constructed and depicted for it's as good of a Godzilla film as we could ever possibly get. Keep in mind, though, that its two hours, overall, do seem unusually lengthy for some odd reason."
"monstermayhem32","7","3","6","20 May 2014"," Decent reboot but feels lacking
","Unlike the 1998 disaster version of Godzilla, this film manages to capture Godzilla with a look and feel that feels closer to the 1954 film version which still remains a classic. Unlike the 98 film which portrays Godzilla more of a villain, this one portrays Godzilla as more of a hero and a defender of mankind just like in the cartoons. One of the perks in the film was the great casting choices particularly Bryan Cranston as Joe but felt as though the character was not given enough screen time to develop. I think Aaron Johnson was great as Joe's son ford. Elizabeth Olsen was also good as fords wife Elle Brody. I do feel as though one of the problems regarding the film was the look of the mute creatures which felt rather cheesy and Godzilla's on screen which didn't happen until an hour into the film. However the film did have plenty of action and destruction in addition to the debate of whether mankind is really in control of nature . I would say that the film is a definite for Godzilla hardcore fans. Just hope that the sequel is better."
"dmitri_faleev","8","3","6","18 May 2014"," Great Godzilla film, not as epic as I hoped. Judge for yourself
","This film is well made and has excellent scenes. The issue I found with it was that the whole time I kept wanting to really see Godzilla in all his glory, it never really happened. A few scenes came close, but overall I went home slightly disappointed the first time I watched it.<br/><br/>I watched it for the second time the next day and enjoyed it much more. I could see what the director was doing with it. I still wish we saw a really long battle that didn't cut to humans so often, but I am sure they'll do it in the sequel.<br/><br/>The acting was OK, but the human characters were not supposed to be very interesting in my opinion. The two monsters' had depth and character even compared to Godzilla who was pretty laid back the whole time. Though the mutus did look almost generic, kinda like the bugs from starship troopers (which were cool at the time), but I found it easy to get over that.<br/><br/>Overall a great film. I really hope for the next film that they create more interesting looking monsters, polish the human contribution, and give us longer awesome fight scenes. For this one I rated it an 8 for great effort, but 7.5 is pretty close to how I felt about it.<br/><br/>Do see it if you haven't yet."
"Reno-Rangan","8","3","6","18 May 2014"," He's taller, bigger and stronger. The king of the monsters is back.
","You know I had expected this movie a lot, after all it is one of my favourite movie characters ever since '98. Excited after seeing first teaser. But I was little unhappy over model of Godzilla, which was more outdated. I mean the blueprint for creating monster was borrowed from '54 version. Which was originally a man with costume performed stunts then later played it on a big screen where actors performed their act in front of it. Now everything is different, we got the technology, then why should choose fat one rather update it with fine anatomical structure. Because usually water animals won't be a fat one. That is why '98 Godzilla looked so perfect with slim and long legs just like an enlarged version of Iguana. Other than not redesigned 3D model, the Godzilla was presented awesomely on the screen with the great visual effects and sounds mixing. I loved to witness it on a large silver screen, it was stunning.<br/><br/>The movie began with a few opening credits and a decent story till forwarded all the way to later 15 years. The boring portions started. Wanted for something to happen somewhere, but had no luck. It only teased me with some sudden loud noises and briskly camera panning away from the characters just what the monster appeared from nowhere, but it didn't. I think the human story and monster's did not synch in with a clean perfect one movie. Humans and monsters were completely parted. At least collision between them would have been very interested, just like the car and helicopter chase in the '98 version.<br/><br/>All the human characters were very weak including army general, the protagonist and his silly mission. I wanted a gutsy person like Stephen Lang, who was excellent in 'Avatar' as a lieutenant colonel. You gonna love the graphic side of the movie, but this story badly misses the rockstar characters like one from Ron Perlman for 'Pacific Rim' and Jean Reno for '98 'Godzilla'. Aaron Johnson was good, but not good enough to handle whole movie himself. The inclusion of another couple of well know actors would have helped better in my opinion. Maybe the surprise entries are kept for a sequel, I guess.<br/><br/>Like any other Godzilla fan, I fought for my ticket that I booked a day earlier and saw on the first day itself. Actually, I enjoyed a lot this movie, but it will never be my favourite Monster movie. 'Favourite' and 'good entertainer' are two different categories. All the good entertainers are not my favourite. Though I cherished this film in a few scenes. Most importantly, this movie making opportunity was landed on the pair of a good hand. I liked 'Monsters', the director shown his caliber in that low budget high quality movie. So I had faith in him, but the thing was he's a documentary style movie maker. I was wondering how this commercial movie gonna shape up. Well, he proved that he can pull the trigger of the bazooka as well. It was visible that he was given freedom to make his way, at least in the majority of the movie.<br/><br/>''Let them fight.''<br/><br/>Must agree this is the best version according to the appearance of the monster. So the credits must go to all the members of special effects and visual effects team. No doubt stunts were breathtaking. It was a 2 hour movie, in that first half was dragged with human drama that I did not like much. It was drifting away from the main picture. So I was lucky in the exact beginning of the second half where the 'king of the monsters' appears in front of us completely with a huge roar. There's another flying monster in the movie called Muto. This second hour is all about them fighting each other. In a couple of the scenes I was totally disappointed where the fights between them were smartly concealed other than showing us through cable news channels and in few other tricky ways. Well, they saved it for the final battle. I guess it was a little late, but in some way it convinces us to satisfy after a long wait.<br/><br/>During the final battle something did not look good. I thought Godzilla was an animal, suddenly he becomes very intelligent and uses his fire-breath in a particular position to defeat his enemy. That's not at all, walking back to the sea was kind of looked like a Disney's fairy tale concept. Because monsters should behave like one not like one of a Marvel's superhero who concerns for human safety. That is the portion made me think like is it a children's movie? Because I just saw it till the end without aware. That small mistake was one of a drawback in the movie. They desperately wanted it for a sequel and so they did it without harming humans around.<br/><br/>There's a generation gap, fighting over different version won't change anything. My favourite version will remain the same and so yours and others. The purpose of all versions is to entertain the audience and so it does. As far now my review was mixed respond with a bit slides toward the negative side. In one line to say what's the wrong with this movie is that human portion of the story was a big letdown, though the vfx tried its best to lift is as much it can.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe repeat viewing this movie won't help us to love it. The first impression is the best, if you got it, then fine, if not, so you must be either '98 or '54 version fan. If you are a Godzilla fan then it is a must see movie whether you like it or not. Put all your faith and take a chance, who knows you may like it better than me.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

There's little to say but expect to be rooting for the Big Guy, he has to commute to San Francisco and didn't pay the toll booth, maybe he didn't have the proper change. Downtown parking was no problem, but I suspect San Francisco real estate values hit bottom as the MUTOs picked Chinatown for nesting. Seriously, couldn't they pick Bay View? The only truly shocking part for me was a seagull hitting a window of a school bus, that almost made me wet myself. I will refrain from spoiling the ending other than saying it cracked me up when the person next to me said ""see you again in 40 years""."

"woralo","4","6","16","15 May 2014"," IMDb got me to see this movie, I was disappointed
","Even though this movie had just 3000 ratings a couple of days ago, at 9.3 I wanted to see this movie. I work at a cinema so I see almost every movie, but when they're rated high on IMDb i'm prone to watch it on the premiere night. I was so bummed out by this movie. I kept watching and waiting for it to get excited, but that never happened. <br/><br/>The movie starts out slowly with a dramatic first ten minutes where Joe Brody, portrayed by Bryan Cranston loses his wife in a tragic monster attack in a nuclear facility. This did set a good tone for the movie even though it was a little cliché. I was really waiting for what was going to happen next. Then the movie unexpectedly fast forwarded 15 years, leaving us wondering what had happened. <br/><br/>It turned out Joe's son Ford Brody, became an army man, which seems only to be because they had to give him a roll where he would be in the midst of all the monster madness. When he visits his obsessed dad in Japan it turns out his dad was right all along and the monsters are conspiracies are real. Conveniently right when father and son visit the site where the MUTO is hatching it does actually hatch. Okay so that can be a coincidence, but that was the first annoyance of the movie. <br/><br/>The most terrible death scene When the monster escapes the island Joe is injured badly and we see him going into cardiac arrest on the chopper. This is where you would normally expect a scene of him dying right then and there, but the scene is cut, as if it's just not important. Then on the aircraft carrier we get to the scene where Ford sees his dad in a body bag... Just like that Joe is dead. Almost as if Bryan Cranston was used for this role, just because of his fame in Breaking Bad, to lure audience to this movie. <br/><br/>So now we are left with Ford, a character that hardly has any lines, and survives several dangerous encounters by insane luck. Also it seems that whenever the MUTO's encounter him they take their time to move slow and observe the situation, while at other times they just devour groups of people in a blink of an eye. <br/><br/>Goodguy Godzilla I am not that familiar with the Godzilla stories, but I expected Godzilla to be the dangerous monster he is perceived as, it didn't bother me he was there to protect us, but I lost the feeling that this movie was about Godzilla at all. <br/><br/>General flaws and absurdities. This movie goes in to my top 10 most absurd situations of all time. To start with the mechanical nuclear bomb. This bomb has been made so that no EMP would render it useless, however the shear force of the MUTO on the device should destroy its clockwork mechanism or at least make it unusable for detonation. It's fairly easy to disarm a nuclear bomb by just taking it apart, but it kept intact. Lucky coincidence? Maybe. <br/><br/>Then there was the moment Ford broke a piece of glass which alerted one of the MUTO's which became very angry at him, because it somehow knew he set its children ablaze. Now how the hell could it hear that in a city that's in flames? There would be noise everywhere, but it can here a broken piece of whatever? Again the monster took its time before wanting to attack which again led to Ford's survival. <br/><br/>Trivial human life With hundreds to thousands of people dying all around in this movie, why is one kids life so important. You see people flying around dying all over the place, but that little child has to survive, because he is in the male protagonist's proximity. That's just too trivial and in this movie all the sentiment seemed like it had to be in there, but it was for no good reason. It's a Godzilla movie, not a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>Too much coincidence - Joe and Ford to be witness for MUTO's escape - Ford to be on the train that is attacked by a MUTO - Ford's son to be on the bridge that is attacked - Ford's son and wife to be in the city the fight takes place - Ford to be the only one who survives the attack on the bridge<br/><br/>I think I might be able to go on with this movie for a while, but it just disappointed me so much, while I was looking out for this so much."
"jorgevializ","1","7","20","17 May 2014"," I want my money back!!!!
","This movie was a total bate and switch. The only reason I considered watching this piece of crap was Bryan Cranston and you kill him in the first 30 minutes, then we have to follow his no acting skills of a son for the remainder of the film. Then if things weren't bad enough Godzilla got even less screen time then Bryan. I mean come on WTF was this piece of crap really about. I thought I was watching Cloverfield II, you see a foot then later you see a tail then oh yea there's his spiny back. Seems the fight scenes only took up 15% of the film and the rest was the US and Japanese debating weather or not to nuke heavily populated areas. <br/><br/>You would have to be a total moron not to let those stupid scenes, like when Ford calls his wife and his wife's phone's caller ID displays his name when he's calling from a satellite phone someone on the base lent him.Or in the end when in a stadium full of thousands of survivors, Elle just happens to find Ford and Sam in two seconds. Also how none of the fighter pilots knew how to eject out of their planes after getting hit by the monster's EMP. The movie is full of stupid scenes like this. At the end 1/4 of the people in the theater were asleep or fighting it. <br/><br/>In closing; As a true Godzilla fan I have never been more disappointed with a release of a film. Knowing that I'm probably going to have to wait another 15 years before they try another crack at it."

","(Be warned: spoilers ahead.) I'm not only disappointed, I feel cheated. The trailers led me to believe this was a remake of the classic original Godzilla movie from the 1950's. That movie featured Godzilla as a towering terror that attacked mankind. This movie embraces the very thing I disliked most about all subsequent Godzilla movies: Godzilla versus some ridiculous adversary. I don't want to see Godzilla as a superhero, I want to see him as he originally was, a menace. For all its flaws, at least the 98 version got that part right. In this version, Godzilla is just an afterthought, and he's trapped in a laughably stupid plot. Two giant cockroaches crawl out of the ground to mate, Godzilla hates cockroaches and stomps them, mankind gushes ""My hero!"" and Godzilla swims away. The End. Seriously?! What is it about Hollywood that few of its highly paid producers, directors and actors can understand the meaning of ""remake""? Well, I'm done. I've learned my lesson. After this, I'm not spending my money on any more remakes."

","In three words: Best Godzilla EVER!!!! In six words: One of the best movies EVER!!!! I have been a Gojira fan since birth, and, after watching all 27 previous Godzilla movies, I had high expectations for this movie. After seeing several trailers, I knew that the movie-makers were going to do their best to make a Godzilla movie worth remembering. Thus, I prepared myself to judge this new reinvigoration of Godzilla.<br/><br/>My hopes were high, and my expectations were even higher. I couldn't contain myself! After waiting two years for the movie to come to theaters, there I sat on the opening night (5/16) in an IMAX auditorium, readying my brain for the adventure to come. I could feel the excitement radiate throughout the theater. All in all, I expected the movie to be good, but I didn't think it would be able to meet, let alone surpass, my expectations.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, something ridiculous had happened: the movie had obliterated my expectations and had revealed itself as not only the best Godzilla movie ever, but as one of my favorite movies of all time!!!!!!!! Oh my gosh, it was perfect! GO WATCH IT!!!! The acting was awesome, the cinematography great, the music ingenious, the plot was engaging, and the special effects were quite mind-boggling! One reviewer stated that the effects are ""like Pacific Rim times 5,"" which is completely spot on. It's amazing! Godzilla is introduced in a completely believable, fantastic way. The first time I saw his face in the movie, I was almost crying because it was so awesome! His roar is phenomenal!!! Truly, I know I am much too enthusiastic about this, but I enjoy being so. I highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this movie. Even if you're a critical moviegoer, you will enjoy the story and action. It's too good!!"
"achyutaghosh","9","5","13","17 May 2014"," Godzilla movie review- Exhilarating experience!
","The king of monsters, the star of 30 movies, the biggest, baddest reptile is back with a bang. When it first stomped and screeched into the screen in 1954, it was a creature of rampant destruction, born out of nuclear radiation. Over the years Godzilla transformed itself into a savior, ridding the world of other fearsome creatures. Godzilla 2014 was a marvelous experience. This version pays homage to the Japanese versions by aping the look and feel of the monster, in addition to promoting its character of being a hero.<br/><br/>The year is 1999, and Japanese scientist Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate the discovery of fossils believed to be of ancient dinosaurs. It is not only fossils though, as something that hatched escaped and causes a nuclear power plant meltdown . Thousands die, including Sandra Brody, wife of plant engineer Joe Brody while the Japanese government covers up the incident as an earthquake. 15 years pass by, and Joe continues his endeavors to find the truth behind the accident. His son Ford, who is an explosives expert aids him in his latest foray, and they find out that giant creatures, called MUTO that feast on radiation were the cause of the meltdown, and are being contained by the government.<br/><br/>""The arrogance of men is in thinking nature is in their control while it is the other way round""<br/><br/>Nature is not to be contained then, and when things get out of control, Godzilla rises from the depths of the seas to restore balance in the world, in a spectacular, epic battle. Godzilla in this movie is a god, a primordial alpha predator who lives close to the earth's radioactive core. He does not really love humans but the stability of the world is important for his own survival, and so he fights the good fight, even after being attacked by the military. As far as the outcome goes, we all know what will happen since Godzilla never loses.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a very different kind of kaiju film. Unlike last year's stylish, in your face Pacific Rim, the monster does not take center stage. It does not get to show off, and for some people there may be too little of Godzilla in his own film. Rather, most of the violence, chaos and liquidation takes place off-screen, or gets featured in massive tracking shots, the beauty and detail of which certainly require second viewings.<br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job in doing the unpredictable, and creating a suspense film out of a monster brawl fest, much like Cloverfield or World War Z. Like Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Godzillá faces the camera a long time into the movie, but when it does, it is a goose pimp-ling moment. He has put on weight, but that calls for all the more respect, as his wallop packs even more power. The visual effects are breath-taking, and this is a movie that is a must watch in 3D. Godzilla finally delivering the coup de grace to the female MUTO is iconic.<br/><br/>Though the star cast consists of heavyweights such as Bryan Cranston, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, Ashley Olsen and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, humans essentially become bystanders in a monster movie. While they all perform competently, there just isn't too much for them to do, but be awestruck most of the time.<br/><br/>Godzilla is an excellent effort, and probably this summer's biggest non superhero movie. Go, watch it. Pander the child in you. I was shouting in the theater.There is nothing profound about it, just honest to goodness fun, and an exhilarating cinematic experience. 9/10"

","I am a 45 year old Godzilla fan. I grew up on those classic films, and devoured them like Godzilla devours radiation. I'm very forgiving on all things related to Godzilla, and I even refrained from bashing the inept US remake from 1998. It's best forgotten...<br/><br/>Godzilla 2014 on the other hand will not be so easy to forget. That's because it is AMAZING. No movie can stack up against a fans dreams and desires, but Gareth's Edwards and his team come very close. <br/><br/>Sure: Bryan Cranston over acts his wig off, the female characters seem a bit weak, the new monsters are just that: new, and the King remains in the dusty shadows until the end and OK, the monster battle scenes could have had more ""contact"" and grit to them but..,<br/><br/>Who cares about all that! THIS IS GODZILLA!<br/><br/>Don't listen to the negative opinions. Especially from those claiming to be ""hard core fans"". A true fan would be worried about only one thing: money. The movie must make money, lots of money. Why? SO THEY OPT TO MAKE MORE!!<br/><br/>The good news? It did just that: Godzilla ruled the box office on Friday May 16th with a stunning $38.5m take. <br/><br/>The KING of the MONSTERS is back, and with him, let's hope that MONSTER movies are back as well. <br/><br/>A+ for effort and scope A- for execution of scenes A+ for GODZILLA himself<br/><br/>Godzilla fans unite and be happy!"

","I was lucky enough to go and see Godzilla last night in IMAX. It was absolutely brilliant.SPOILERS AHEAD. There was a lot of build up to the end Godzilla fight sequence, which lasted around 45minutes. But you have the most emotional beginning 20 mins to a movie that I have seen in a while. This all because of Bryan Cranstons performance, which sadly is short lived. But then we have the narrative shifted to Ford played by Arron Taylor Johnson. Many people have a problem with Johnson but I liked him. Was he as interesting as Cranston, no. But he had to follow Cranston and that is tough. But Taylor is not a Negative of this movie. BUT when Godzilla first stomps on to screen, the whole theatre was in shock. The Second act slowed down the movie quite a bit(which is my only negative) Then we get to the Third act. Godzilla. Skyscraper. Atomic Breath. Hero....See it to believe it!"
"e-guiso","9","5","13","17 May 2014"," Go into this movie looking to experience something not typically presented well in epic movies like this: humanity, and I doubt you'll be disappointed.
","If you've seen Gareth Edwards' previous film, Monsters (currently my favorite film), you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from his take on Godzilla, the undisputed king of monsters. Instead of focusing all-out on the creatures, though they get plenty of screen time, he instead turns the camera towards humanity as much as possible. How is this affecting people?<br/><br/>Edwards' sense of pacing from Monsters is also carried forward in Godzilla. Slow burn until the very end, where everything has come together quite naturally, and then all the stops are pulled and everyone's jaw drops. Some people might call both movies boring. Some people can also shut up. His movies are about subtlety through a narrow view of large events, and focus on all aspects of this medium more equally and with more skill than any other director I know of. If you find his films boring, it is likely you do not like literature, non-pop music, or photography either, and I feel so, so sorry for you.<br/><br/>Godzilla is quite slow for a big chunk of the movie, but it's deliberate. Everything has to be set up and the audience has to be squirming with anticipation before anything big happens. And oh boy, do big things happen.<br/><br/>Go into this movie looking to experience something not typically presented well in epic movies like this: humanity, and I doubt you'll be disappointed. Also, Godzilla himself is the most awesome, empathetic, whole-audience-cheering-worthy monster ever and you cannot convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. I'll be seeing it a couple more times, at least."

","After reading all the positive reviews am slightly inclined to feel that there must be something wrong with the theater screen of mine. <br/><br/>I thought the movie was a big letdown. Right from the acting to the main actor in the movie- Godzilla.. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston of course will act as he always does- Superb. But the rest of the crew was just doing everything in a listless manner. Sometimes they looked as if they didn't even belong on the screen. <br/><br/>The CGI was decent (when it was there) but that is something that has come to be expected of Hollywood. <br/><br/>There were various scenes in which they were trying to build up the movie or a scene both emotionally or sometimes for a suspense but it was left to the audience to lend a hand to their effort. <br/><br/>And don't even try and think during the movie. The moment you start thinking along the lines of why and what, you will start getting irritated cause there are no answers in the film. <br/><br/>In the end, at no point in the movie was I carried along with the script or the scenes. I was starved for scenes to make the movie worthwhile. I can't write anymore without giving spoilers (which i hate) but it felt like the majority of the movie and the vision of it must have looked grand in the director's eyes but i just can't share his story or vision ..

It looks that movie budget has plunged and all interesting actors have disappeared after the first 10 minutes of the movie. another 20 minutes you contemplate if you are watching a drama or action, because there is nothing about Godzilla. <br/><br/>Then remaining 2.5 hours is about how one lizard ate two bugs. that's is. literally. <br/><br/>It's an epic fail :("
"R-Clercx","5","6","17","14 May 2014"," Impressive special effects but lacks capturing storytelling
","Although the new adaptation of Godzilla tries to stick more to the original Japanese story than the previous Hollywood adaptation, in the end it suffers from the blockbuster mentality.<br/><br/>The main characters do not manage to drag you into the story, nor do you experience their fear. It's like watching fireworks: the human perspective is lost. You could not care less what happens to the characters in the story.<br/><br/>In stead you are watching a high tech spectacle which is only appealing the first half hour when the fear of the monster is mostly suggestive. The main characters who could have offered a public point of view on the battle are shoved to the background.<br/><br/>I was wondering what the director was trying to prove here: what is the point of introducing human characters if they nearly do not interact in the battle with the monster.<br/><br/>The previous adaptation is often ridiculed for it's humorous undertone, but this one is too bloody serious. How bloody serious can one be about a monster with a radio active breath which gets bigger with each remake?<br/><br/>Overall I found it a huge waste of movie budget and especially of the overpriced 3D tickets which make the film even darker than it is already."

","*CONTAINS SPOILERS* When I first began my journey to the theater for the late Saturday showing I was mesmerized by all of the thoughts and fears that had flooded and plagued my head. As I entered the theater I thought back to the times as a child when my grandfather would sit my down on a Sunday night and enjoy a nice sci-fi flick from his vault, which for some reason would always end up being a Godzilla film or two. So, as I am sure you can tell I was jammed into have very high hopes for this movie. And, to me and my grandfathers surprise, it delivered. <br/><br/>As we watched the movie in the theater I was continuously surprised by strength of this film and sheer emotion that it provoked, reminding me so much of the original. Of course like any other Godzilla fan when we had heard of this films creation me and my grandfather where a little spectacle after the horrendous TriStar attempt at a movie back in 1998 that about brought tears to my eyes. Now I'm sure your wondering what made this movie so great? the answer, the director and love that was presented in the creation in this movie. Had this been the case perhaps the 1998 film would have been everything that this was.<br/><br/>And though Godzilla is only in this for a select amount of time he still rules the theater every time he jumps in screen, and not only that, the final battle with the MUTOs is incredible. I watched in awe as Godzilla ripped threw the MUTOs and jumped in excitement when Godzilla finished of the final MUTO which his radioactive breath, just incredible. I believe the only thing that brought this movie down was the false advertising show Bryan Cranston in the entire flick and Aaron Taylor Johnson's random stares of into the distance every 10 minutes. Other then this the film is very appealing and takes me back to the great memories I had as a kid and the love for the creation of Godzilla that I hoped to see. I give it a 9/10"
"nidhoggr1171","2","4","10","11 August 2014"," Puzzled....
","I must admit that I downloaded this film as I missed it in theaters. And I was glad I missed. As I was watching it I was genuinely puzzled. At some point (the scene with that kid on a train) I stopped watching and went to IMDb to see if there is an Asylum ripoff called Godzilla and I accidentally downloaded their version, as it did happen a few times before. And it only got worse after that scene. This movie really is as bad as any of the Asylum movies (no plot whatsoever, bad acting, no character development,...), except for the mediocre CGI, which is slightly better. There's one more thing that puzzles me, why do all action scenes in modern Hollywood productions take place at night and when it's raining? Did someone in Hollywood read some movie making book (some movie maker's bible or something) where it's written that the audience enjoy action scenes better if they can't see them? This movie isn't worth seeing it in theaters. If you really wish to see it, download it."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","2","4","10","4 July 2014"," Lame
","Too long, and featuring far too much drama in its opening scenes. Nearly the first thirty minutes of this focuses on the drama of the father dealing with his wife's death from fifteen years earlier- completely irrelevant to the story. It didn't need to be in the story, it was only there to make the hero (if that's what he could be considered) into a formulaic tragic hero, trying to redeem himself. His daughter-in-law, waiting at home for her husband, was only there to give us a generic hero-must-save-his-family drama. Wholly inept attempts at characterisation. The characters need to be interesting, and add something to the story, rather than become cardboard cut-outs; caricatures instead of characters. The character story in Jaws, for example, tied in perfectly and blended perfectly with the story of the shark, we learned the character's stories, and why they are the best men for the job, as they were hunting the shark. But here, the characters are just stock caricatures laid on top of a supplemental monster/ disaster movie plot. If one is going to do a movie with nothing but caricatures like this, don't take it so seriously, and give the audience its share of cheeseball fun or charm. <br/><br/>Ken Watanabe seems like a good actor, and left the most impression on me (most of the rest of the other actors just seemed to be phoning it in) but he has nothing to work with here, and spends most of the film looking like he's in shock, which dulls its effect after a few scenes, and makes it appear as though he is in a trance. <br/><br/>The effects were good, the climactic battle was good, but when Godzilla is reduced to a supporting character role, not fully appearing until four fifths of the way into the film, it seems like a waste. I'm not saying that Godzilla should be in every minute of the film , but a 100- minutes long build up to a 15-minutes long battle is too much. By the time the climactic battle began, quite frankly, I was bored, and just didn't care any longer. <br/><br/>Gargantuan plot holes, like the US military *not* noticing the HUGE hole blasted into the radioactive dumping grounds, and *not* noticing a 300- tall creature strolling toward the city, further sink this one."

","At one stage during the film a character introduces himself to a Japanese scientist. ""Dr. Serizawa? Jerry Boyd. Just to warn you, it's a mess. A total mess."" And that sums up this entire film.<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing that a film that is supposed to be about one of Movie History's most iconic characters barely uses him.<br/><br/>As to Acting? There IS no acting whatsoever throughout the entire film. The bloke out of Kick Ass seemed to be asleep and the less said about his pointless family the better. After getting back home to San Francisco from a 14 month tour of duty he jets off to Japan 5 minutes after arriving home just because his mad dad was in jail for trespass. Yeah that would happen! <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston the dad just phoned in his performance as a crazy old man who for no sensible reason the US military allowed into its top secret facility after throwing him out earlier in the film.<br/><br/>The 'story' makes absolutely no sense at all and simply highlights the stupidity of the US military. Not that the scientists are shown in the best light either as they do some pretty idiotic things during the movie.<br/><br/>It would take longer than the film to cover the absurdities the film presents to its audience. Such as why evacuate civilians over the Golden Gate Bridge knowing two huge monsters are going to pass under it. Simply go North and South and avoid the monsters. The film makers not having a clue what EMP does. Or for no fathomable reason the soldiers do a 30,000 feet HALO jump into the area where 2 monsters fight it out. This made no sense other than it looked cool. Why not use a helicopter or drive there. And the sight of Godzilla being 'escorted' by the US navy was too ridiculous for words.<br/><br/>The 3D was a joke as nothing remotely interesting happens in 3D. It was really poor 3D anyhow and the money would have been better spent on a script or motivating one or two of the actors into actually looking interested.<br/><br/>The MUTOs looked like they were designed by a committee and are about as menacing as Sooty. Godzilla is supposed to be hunting them but once he wipes them out he loses all interest in them. <br/><br/>Whenever the monsters start to fight we cut to some useless scene with the actors or the army and see a few glimpses on a TV screen. What little monster on monster action we get is pretty underwhelming and poorly executed.<br/><br/>Cloverfield showed what could be done with the huge monster genre and Pacific Rim, even if it was a bit cheesy, did a very good job as well. Godzilla on the other hand was to quote one of the cast 'a total mess'.<br/><br/>Another film that promised a lot but delivered bugger all. Damn shame as Godzilla deserved better than this."

I won't get into details, I'll just notice that Gogdilla has nothing to do with Gareth Edwards 2010 Monsters. I don't blame him for that; we very well know that this is a producer movie. It's the toll of going from 800 k budget to 160 million. His only mistake was accepting to direct it but I understand that his check must have a lot of zeros at the end so I can't blame him for that either.

","My review of Godzilla 2014 Review {Warning Spoilers.}<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>The movie Godzilla by Legendary and Warner Brothers pictures is a good movie which I personally enjoyed very much for a 2014 summer movie. The story is good with the action and excitement of the story. The movie had a good beginning to the end. The movie Godzilla been around for years but mainly in Japan. The movie Godzilla is huge in the country of Japan. The United States Company Hollywood only made one Godzilla movie that were back in 1998. The movies was a fun action flick but not serious. The 1998 movie was okay unlike Godzilla, 2014. <br/><br/>Brief of the Story.<br/><br/>The Story was very good from the beginning to the end, it started out good with how they were trying to stop the monsters. The story started in The French Polynesia in the pacific. It than lead to The Philippines, Japan, Honolulu Hawaii United States, Nevada, Las Vegan, The Forest and finally San Francisco. These were the locations of the story mainly based. It mainly took place in Japan and San Francisco, United States. The character started though in the Philippines with the scientist investigating, then goes to Japan where we meet the main characters.<br/><br/>In these locations in the movie they each had their moments, some scenes were sadden like the nuclear plant in Japan and Hawaii, San Francisco where the monsters caused the most damage and wreckage. I enjoyed the story the most about the movie Godzilla. It not a movie for someone who does not follow what is happening from the beginning to the end. It easy to follow if you are a focused person that can understand what is happening. The story of the movie is wonderful in different ways.<br/><br/>The first set of characters in Godzilla goes by the name of Dr. Ichiro Serizawa with his assistant who is a female. Dar. Serizawa who is the head of the Science Team and lead investigated of Godzilla and Muto. In Japan we meet Lieutenant Ford Brody the son of Joe Brody and Sandra Brody. There been a tragedy at the a Nuclear Plant in Japan. After The Nuclear Plant Disaster the goes 15 years into the future where we meet older Lieutenant Ford Brody. It lead to different events throughout the story.<br/><br/>The human side in the movie did not play a big part in the movie. They mainly investigating and trying to find a way to stop the monsters that were causing havoc across the world mainly in Asia and North Americans continents and The Pacific. The three species made the movie interesting though especially in the beginning when leading up to the final showdown in San Francisco, California. My favorite part of the movies was with The Military in certain locations and the final fight scene between Godzilla and The Two flying beasts who were breeding. Godzilla had to defeat the Flying Beasts that were in the movie.<br/><br/>The Acting<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good in the movie. There were some flaws in the movie but it was not terrible. The movie had some good actors. I though don't know many of them but that not a bad thing, it always good watching new and different actors. I know couple people from other movies and TV shows that I watched over the years. They made the story pleasant but it was The Story that made Godzilla great that I think should be along with other good SciFi movies.<br/><br/>The Overview.<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable and they did a fantastic job on the movie. The designs of the creatures and settings were very good, it almost like Pacific Rim and Man Of Steel, Inception in movies. The movie focused more on the story than the action which most SciFi-Action movies focused on the action. I think it important for movies to focus more on the story than having non-stop action.<br/><br/>I know Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures produced better movies with story and action. Godzilla is a good movie for those that like science fiction, monsters, action and adventure as well with story and action. The movie is easy to follow to understand what is happening. It not a movie for those that can't understand what is happening from the beginning to the end. Overall it easy to understand and it's a enjoyable movie."

","This film was not as big a letdown as it would have been had I not read some of the reviewers that hated the movie. One reason we didn't get a good look at Godzilla until the last portion of the film is because seeing from the beginning would have been too much of a letdown. The monsters he fought were just as stupid-looking and impossible in a real world where the laws of physics (weight, flying, quick movement by zillion-ton creatures) reign, as G was. OK, no spoilers, so how do I get three more lines in this box? You know, I wouldn't even rent this film when it comes out on DVD/BluRay. Oh... there was no applause (Hope that isn't a spoiler.) When Rodan... I mean Godzilla took on the other monsters, probably because there were about ten others (No, not ten other monsters, people.) in the theater, all old fogies like me, who thought the 1950s rubber-suited Japanese Godzilla was better, in its day, than this one in 2014."
"The_Dead_See","3","4","10","18 May 2014"," A string of ridiculous coincidences derails all the fun.
","Godzilla had two things going for it, the special effects were nice, and Bryan Cranston. Unfortunately Cranston's character is killed off after about fifteen minutes and the pretty visuals just aren't enough to hold the rest of the movie together. The writing is the true villain here, the concept itself is somewhat flawed, with Godzilla basically being an jerk who seems hellbent on stopping the Mutos from having babies no matter what with little to no reason; but it's the string of ridiculous coincidences that really puts the nail in the coffin, not the least of which is that the protagonist hilariously finds himself wherever Godzilla is no matter where he goes on the globe almost to the point of it being like a spoof. <br/><br/>Additional bad writing sees our intrepid hero as being a trained paratrooper, nuclear weapons specialist and wearing a variety of other lifetime-career hats too - pretty impressive for a twenty-something. At its most laughable moments the military play hide and seek with a skyscraper sized monster which, although it shakes the ground with the slightest fart, seemingly also has the capability to tiptoe around like a ballet dancer. <br/><br/>The finale, a fight between GZ and the two Mutos is a little bit of fun. But putting a cherry on top of a turd still doesn't make it pleasant eating. All in all, it was an improvement over Emmerich's terrible attempt at Godzilla, but it still sucked."

","The last time I watched Godzilla was the 1998 version which was too corny and extremely bad, because 1, the director missed the point of Godzilla, and 2. its just Godzilla running around causing amok.<br/><br/>Going to the film, I can say that this version is far better than the 1998 Godzilla, but since I have not seen the original Godzilla, I can't really judge how much the film is compared to the original.<br/><br/>There are two minor criticisms of the movie: Godzilla only appears for twenty minutes and most of the film is more focused on these creatures that have the ability to shut down any power for ten seconds. Another minor criticism I have is the ending; the ending is unrealistic and somehow badly done.<br/><br/>These minor criticisms however can be subsided; the amazing cinematography, the great acting by Bryan Cranston, and mostly a sense of satisfaction make up for the film's flaws.<br/><br/>Godzilla is loud, but at the same time has character in the film, which is what blockbusters nowadays don't really do.<br/><br/>I give this film a 9/10."
"jakecsw2011","5","4","10","17 May 2014"," Not awful, but disappointing
","For a movie called Godzilla there was very little Godzilla. Seriously, if you've seen the trailer you've seen 95% of him. Instead you see an awful lot of dull military talk and a bit of these 2 giant insect things walking and flying about. <br/><br/>Plus everything seems to be set during the night and when there's loads of smoke/dust so you never really get a good look at the monsters.

","I'm a 60 year old guy with very fond memories of the Godzilla franchise from my youth. I recently watched ""Godzilla: King of Monsters"" with Raymond Burr and was really impressed how well it's held up. This remake is oddly true to the spirit of weird heritage of this series. Usually, disaster films heavy in CGI don't do anything for me but this one is oddly affecting. Yeah, humans in it are kind of superfluous to the plot but it's a GODZILLA MOVIE, not Citizen Kane. You go to see kaiju battling it out and cities being destroyed with a few lines of dialog about man and nature. On that level, it's something of a masterpiece. Highly recommended."
"spunderdog","4","4","10","17 May 2014"," Not enough Godzilla
","There was very little of Godzilla to watch. Most of the movie dealt with military prep, family bonding and more time with the MUTO's than Godzilla. Granted that Godzilla was done in a nice manner but most scenes were dark, jerky and lacked personality. We have all of the other 29 Godzilla movies and have been fans for over 40 years but this was disappointing. Very little need for 3-D as there was little to ..oooooh about in this aspect. As was hinted at previously, this was not a remake of the original. This was a separate plot. Godzilla was a second tier actor in his own movie. The movie needed to be more about Godzilla and less about the subplots that took most of the movie time."
"arnieiam","9","4","10","17 May 2014"," Eahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhr! (Supposed to be the Godzilla roar)
","This was one film I really wanted to see this year thanks to be shrouded in such secrecy. It could really enhance the film experience or ruin it. In a way, while I still enjoyed this film, it did kind of both.<br/><br/>I will try not to spoil this film but what the trailers hinted at is that this movie takes place in a world where monsters exist. And given that zombies have taken over pop culture, Pacific Rim really needs some backup.<br/><br/>The plot basically starts out with Heisenberg trying to figure out the truth behind an incident which he witnessed and that leads to the revelation that monsters exist. However Malcolm's dad isn't the central protagonist of this film, he actually gets cut short of screen time. Thats what happens when you get the 'and' label in the opening credits. However the amount of screen time he had, it was either go hard or go home, and he put his Breaking Bad chops into play.<br/><br/>Actually the central protagonist is Kick Ass, and really? He's too damn young or at least too young looking to play a high ranking military guy and family man. Just because he's married to a lady twice his age doesn't mean he can play mature roles. And he's basically has a Brad Pitt World War Z story arc, trying to reconnect with his wife, a good looking Olsen sister I didn't know exist. There is Saito, who plays the scientist researching the monsters and has some pretty questionable philosophical views. And there are way too man expendable characters.<br/><br/>I've been talking about the actors too much and that's because the movie focuses on the humans. Which is good story telling because it's easier to be invested in the story, just like the Walking Dead. But let's be honest, aren't we here to see monsters scrap? Well we kind of do but there's way too much buildup. Whenever we do see monsters finally come on screen the first couple of times it immediately cuts to the aftermath. You get serious blue balls. Eventually it does pay off, not the way you hope but it has some insanely cool moments.<br/><br/>The imagery of this film, wow. Remember that 1998 Roland Emmerich film? Yea that's a Disney film, with all the markings of a pre-9/11 light hearted romp. This film has such beautiful but shockingly dark and brooding imagery. When the carnage and destruction takes place, it's a little disturbing but jaw dropping at the same time. It basically recaptures the sense of atmosphere by the original 1954 Ishiro Honda picture.<br/><br/>This movie also has a not-so-subtle anti-nuclear power and weapons theme. Come on, Hollywood why do you keep demonizing something that you clearly don't fully understand? Nuclear energy is clean and renewable, and if disposed of properly the waste decays in time without doing much harm. And nuclear weapons while scary, will always be used as deterrents and not as actual weapons.<br/><br/>In the end this film is a very solid effort. You will find yourself, like me, nitpicking the crap out of it, but still enjoying it. It is not disappointing at all like the 1998 movie and it manages to capture its tone really well."
"jordan-allan84","8","4","10","17 May 2014"," Godzilla (2014)
","There hasn't been a good Godzilla movie for far too long. The whole 'monster movie' has actually been pretty dormant recently, with only a few movies like Pacific Rim to give the genre some life.<br/><br/>Now Godzilla is back; with solid action and CGI as well as a competent cast. The action is very well paced, and the monster itself moves in a realistic way; it feels like Godzilla is truly powerful as well as massive - reportedly the biggest it has ever been. The animation rarely calls itself into question too, and the massive amount of CGI used doesn't detract from the movie at all. The impact in the battles is so believable it made me flinch, if you're thinking of seeing Godzilla it has to be in 3D! Bryan Cranston does a great job in his role, as one expects, and the rest of the cast are okay too... most of the cast, anyway.<br/><br/>The human protagonist for much of the movie is Ford Brody, Bryan Cranston's character's son. Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnston, and I have to admit that this character wasn't up to scratch. I never got a connection from Taylor-Johnston at all, I genuinely didn't believe a word he said and I didn't buy into his motivations at all. I'm not a Taylor-Johnson fan, and the fact that he has been cast as Quicksilver of the Marvel Universe makes me nervous.<br/><br/>Godzilla is an overall good movie, dotted with some noticeable flaws. The two hour run-time contains loads of surprises that the trailers didn't give away too, which is nice. If you've read this far into my review then you must be interested - go see it, you'll regret missing it."

","Likes : Let me just say that everyone complains about c.g.i being in a film but this film will change your mind, the special effect, the C.G.I of this film blow me away, this is one of the most fantastic film's I've seen in a long time, although some of it is slightly flawed this film is awesome. The direction of this film is perfect it doesn't just start off with an all out monster fight, it build's the film up to one massive monster fight, but it doesn't just focus on the monsters it also focus's on the human in the middle of the cross fire. Who every design the features & look of Godzilla i would shake their hand because they made one of the best looking bad ass Godzilla looks ever it was like looking at a pit-bull on steroid big on a massive scale which gave Godzilla this mean looking don't mess with alpha monster, i love that they gave him a personality which i did notice because in curtain scene he seem to avoid killing an humans as he came in which was so odd because at first you don't really notice it but you start seeing that he not there to kill human but there to kill the creature's. This is nothing like what has been done before because this seriously pay homage to the original Godzilla film's not the failed attempted 1998 version of Godzilla, but this has one special surprise which i loved the fact they introduced in this film which really show's homage to the original films was brilliant done in this film. Bryan Cranston's acting in particular is fantastic in this film really sell the emotional scene although (Spoiler Alert) he not in this film long, he part was brilliant to give the film its build up which was also emotional & intense at some point, The monsters? The visual effects? The story? are all Spot on. This is truly the monster Godzilla film we have been waiting for all the fan of the original film we be surprised just how close to the original versions this film is the director who is a small time director has made a massive gem of a film that fans have been long for, the creature design is awesome in way they are parasite type creatures where the female is bigger & male are smaller but the fight scene with these creature with Godzilla is just beyond awesome this is a big must to see at the cinema.<br/><br/>Dislikes : (Spoiler alert) One thing that was annoying that was disappointing its the lack of fight scene's, about two maybe 3 fight scene just has it get in to a fight it cuts to other scene just as your about to get in to the fight, but the film does redeem that at the end because it was an awesome fight scene."

Bryan Cranston had a great performance and everyone else did their jobs well also. Godzilla himself definitely stole the show though! Just so epic and bada**! Job well done on this one! I thought the relationships were well done and the music was great also. I'm hoping we get to see some sequels down the road with this type of feel to it. I really think they can reinvent this genre for as good of a job as they did with this one. If is maybe one minor minor complaint, it may be that the second main actor outside of Crantson doesn't quite own the screen the way Bryan does, but Cranston is just such a great talent that this isn't really a big gripe!"
"orionschwert","3","8","26","14 May 2014"," Oh crap !
","Should you see this movie.....? If you are a monster and dinosaur fan under 16 and you haven't seen Pacific Rim yet, definitely ! And maybe if you have on a rainy day off and you are bored from internet and you absolutely do not know what to do. And if it was for the last reason, even here you do not feel that this movie will stay longer in your brain as exactly this rainy afternoon. At least I will have latest by tomorrow completely forgotten about this movie and this is the good thing about it. Only scene which has left me with a little ""wow"", that was when the army forces plane jumped. That was visually interesting and with the Space Odyssey 2001 sound laid under even acoustic wise interesting. All the rest, but really all the rest of the 118 minutes left, I have seen already 5 times in the last 2 years. What was the point of doing this movie ? I will tell you. Only point about this movie is keeping the people at work. So many salaries are in such a Hollywood crap that they often do not care at all what they are feeding the audience. This is somewhat sad and certainly sad for Ken Watanabe, the actor from Inception (he played this time so lousy) and the people from Legendary. Binoche was only in it for her name and to fool the willing to pay audience that there could be some real acting in this film. And why, why, why, always the same f.....g kind of story ? Muscle army husband has to leave his family to fight the monster and cutie blonde wife and cutie kid are left behind but for sure, 1 hour later, for some reason, back in the middle of the war zone. And sure, Godzilla (or it's counterparts) had to be fought by Americans in San Francisco, but hey, so intelligent, in the Chinese quarter. That makes it feel so real Japanese. No, I really hoped for something at least similar to Pacific Rim but this is by far not the case at all. 3 points out of 10 for quiet flawless CGI and some nice 3D moments in the beginning of the movie + plane jumpers. So it's not complete rubbish but nearly."

","Godzilla was a big disappointment to say at least. The movie was extremely long winded and it could go several scenes without anything interesting happening. Another thing that bothered me was that so called ""spores"" (definition: a supernatural creature which is Godzillas ""enemy"" and feed itself by consuming radioactive energy) also was in the movie. In fact, the spores had far more screen time than Godzilla, which I found absurd. Both the spores and Godzilla are portrayed as some kind of ""radioactive monsters"".<br/><br/>Also, in one of the final scenes, Godzilla fires off some kind of radioactive energy on his opponent, the spore. Godzilla is portrayed as some kind of a hero that saves an entire city from going under by the spores. Godzilla is suppose to be a cruel monster that destroys everything in his way, not save human lives. <br/><br/>The trailer looked incredible but that was not the case regarding the entire movie. <br/><br/>// Disappointed Godzilla fan"

Someone mentioned the earlier version tho didn't realize back in the 90's, thought it was earlier than that but that was a TERRIFIC movie, loved the plot/storyline, and was even sad when Godzilla was killed. I thought this would be a continuation of the earlier version after the ending from that one or at least a redone version to continue to further sequels.

Anyone here or you know personally giving this movie a rating over 2 , don't know anything about movies.They probably think Rambo was the best movie they ever saw. Godzilla is a lazy movie.

This was a complete waste of 150 million or what ever this movie cost. It should have cost 100,000, just so the director could pay using the U.S. Army equipment and the 4 or 5 people that had dialogue in the movie.I don't understand how people would talk about Godzilla when it's daylight outside, then when you see Godzilla in the next scene,it's raining and fog and total blackness is all over the city . This is cheap movie making . When the movie is over , you left with, who are these people hugging after the city is wrecked ? And why does the camera keeps showing this weird kid who makes the same face throughout the movie, is the kid related or something to Godzilla??I didn't see any fangs or fire coming out his mouth.This was a total waste of a movie and time filmed .

"nycmode75","3","5","14","16 May 2014"," Yet another lifeless remake
","It's been awhile since I had the urge to review a film, but after seeing the preview for the latest Godzilla film, I feel it's my civic duty to offer my less-than stellar opinion.<br/><br/>Any fan of Godzilla films will immediately notice that the spirit of the films didn't simply lie in the campy or satirical nature of the movies. It wasn't always about the guys in monster suits or ridiculous English overdubs that these films were memorable for. Ultimately Godzilla was a modern day metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power - and the consequences of mankind's hubris in the face of mother nature.<br/><br/>While this film removes some of the bad taste from 1998's lizard fest remake - the movie makes some of the same mistakes that doomed the previous film 16 years ago. <br/><br/>First of all - the failure to coherently tie-in the nuclear allegory literally kills the film from the get go. The audience is treated to a vague flashback to a Fukushima-like event which sparks a series of events that ultimately leads Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to set off on his own personal quest to find answers to these mysterious questions that had huge ramifications on his own family as well. The problem here - despite some interesting references to the ""truth"" behind a series of Eisenhower-era atomic tests in the Pacfic - over time, there never really is any clear link between the nuclear story and the evolution of Godzilla and other similar monsters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's up to Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his sidekick, Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins - in a totally wasted performance on the heels of her excellent run on Blue Jasmine) to provide viewers with equally vague explanations of what's really happening as these monsters start appearing out of nowhere (despite decades of government cover ups and nobody noticing for 60 years). Yes - most of the movie is just as illogical. <br/><br/>In the end - we're treated to hours of human interaction that is poorly developed. Audiences are introduced to an endless series of new characters such as Joe's son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson - in a performance that was as vague and boring as most of the film), his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen - looking completely most of the time) and Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn - clearly just collecting a paycheck) - and yet it's hard to care about any of them. All this because any time we get a glimpse of their motivations, the movie swings to the next ludicrous crisis and the actors are left to fill brain dead roles in yet another Hollywood disaster movie.<br/><br/>The biggest failure here beyond all that was simply the fact that for a film billed as a Godzilla movie - the legendary monster actually isn't in the film for a good deal of time. Even the final marquee battle (that was well shot) feels laborious, partially because at this point audiences are so exhausted by the confusing and lackluster human element stories that they just want to get the movie over with. Rarely do you watch a monster movie and wish that the beasts quickly destroy whatever city they are in so we can all rush out the door.<br/><br/>In the end this film can't decide if it wants to be a 21st century summer blockbuster, a cautionary tale of nuclear energy, a B-movie aimed at pleasing fans, or simply a special effects demolition derby. One thing is for sure - the lack of character development, reliance on poorly developed human stories that seem insignificant in the face of monumental disasters and the lack of Godzilla for most of the film makes this yet another poor rehash that's destined for obscurity as soon as the next 2014 summer blockbuster is released a week later (X-Men)"

My wife was unfamiliar with Godzilla, so I was more enthused. Two hours later, we walked out of the theater--slightly deaf-- wondering what had happened.So I didn't even try Godzilla 2000. But this Godzilla. This had promise. Great cast, great CGI, an air of suspense. And that was all it had, promise. Cranston was in the movie about as long as Godzilla--maybe ten minutes.

Godzilla 2014 is a great example of a film that makes a movie right with amazing characters, plot, and overall a very great cast of producers and directors.

","I was really hoping this would finally be a good monster movie but sadly i have to wait.<br/><br/>The most interesting characters dies in the beginning(the father and the mother). The ""scientist"" had a constant face of someone who just crap his pants. The Main guy of the story is not memorable. The kid he looks after have no impact in the story and only serves the purpose of trying to make him seem as a nice guy who we know he already was. Hes stating several times that hes trying to get back to his wife and son but takes detours all the time. He could just call and tell them to..you know..flee!<br/><br/>We are first introduced to a giant bat bug thing(with amazing voice), who the scientists literally nurtured to the hatching point even though they knew the cocoon it was in feeds on radiation! One would assume common sense would hit there. Also they never had a second thought that the second cocoon who was dumped in a radio active junkyard would spark back to life and hatch! Also how does the workers there not notice a giant bug forcing itself out the back of the facility?! These things got the ability to shoot out a wave that shuts down everything electric. So any modern vehicle just drops dead. You would assume they would learn from this after seeing their planes drop in the ocean the first time but no. During the entire movie they send ships and planes into these monsters range.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself get little screen time. I believe someone did a count and found he had 13 min screen time in total. And most of those are of his spiky back.<br/><br/>The people get this great idea that they can lure the monsters with a giant nuke(armed even) thus pretty much directly deliver it to the male bug, who then deliver it to the female as a: plz love me? gift. The female later lays her eggs around the bomb(by this point i assume the two have mated to fertilize the eggs) so that the eggs may feed of the bombs energy and hatch. The people dive in in a hope to disarm the bomb but doesn't make the effort to open it when they find its slightly jammed. So they start carrying it to a boat! I find this pointless as they said earlier this bomb would make any other nuclear bomb incident seem like a baby and would destroy a massive part of the country even if it went off far at sea. In the end its only 5-8 min off the coast....yea....<br/><br/>In the end Godzilla defeats the bugs and walks off and hero and wife are reunited though the only couple i cared about was the two bugs. come-on. when they nose rubbed they where awfully cute! Even sounded cute!<br/><br/>Also Godzilla is called a hero in the very end. o.k. he did kill the bugs i will give him that, but its not like he did it for anyone but himself. They posed a great threat to him so he had to hunt them. Nothing more nothing less.<br/><br/>Still think i prefer the American Godzilla. At least it had A lot of fish."

","Gareth Edwards Godzilla is a powerful building film that goes for the same tone of the original. Godzilla himself looks impressive with his larger build and more bear like face. His opponents: the MUTOs are also well designed (sort of an alien beetle). This movie has garnered criticism that honestly aren't well though out. 1. Godzilla isn't in enough of the move, Again this is along the lines of the original which hid the monster even more so than in this. 2. Bryan Cranston wasn't in enough either. This is not a criticism, his character was in it for 30 minutes, so that's how long he was in it 3. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting was terrible. His character is an emotionally withdrawn character who witnessed a tragedy and then delt with his obsessive father for the next 19 years. 4 No strong females. Again, not a criticism, there was no need for one, not every movie needs one, it's a Godzilla movie just enjoy it."

","All of these negative reviews are not true Godzilla fans. This is a popcorn movie for crying out loud, not an Oscar contender. Well, maybe the special effects which are top notch.<br/><br/>Maybe a spoiler: The roar, the look, the fights and his atomic blast breathing are what Godzilla is all about and they are here with a vengeance. I actually cheered when he blasted the MUTO right in his mouth. The extras in the Blu-ray give you some background of the Monarch program which helps a bit if you don't remember or know about the nuclear testing that was done in the 50's. <br/><br/>If you are a Godzilla fan, just watch and judge it for yourself."

","A group of UCLA film students were smoking dope in Westwood, and created the most daring plan in the history of cinema. Why not kidnap all the talented people associated with Godzilla 2014 and make their own movie? Far out, Dude. <br/><br/>To avoid spoilers, I won't divulge the boring details of the kidnapping of talented directors, writers, special effects artists and actors originally hired. All the stoney students were BIG fans of Breaking Bad, so the only original cast member was Bryan Cranston. He quickly began asking too many hard questions, so they killed off his character after only 20 minutes into the movie, paid him his millions, smoked another 20 bowls and continued on.<br/><br/>They worked hard into each night, fueled by drugs, pizza and caffeinated soft drinks. Like all stoners, good ideas came and went, unrealized. They tried real hard, but their drug fueled fuzzy thinking permeates each and every scene. The premises sounded good, and the THC influenced authors were certain everyone would get it.<br/><br/>They began running out of money (several million was spent on Domino's alone) so they hired children to fill out the scenes. They worked cheap. Eventually, they ran out of pot, pizza and capital, so they threw together a dumb ending and finished. <br/><br/>The real filmmakers were released, their budget spent, their original ideas gone and the substitute film in the can. They decided not to go public, since the product was watchable and probably makes sense to stoned 12 year olds. <br/><br/>This movie is not ""so bad it's good."" It's so bad that it's....so bad. It's more fun to rewatch the one made in the 50s.<br/><br/>Now the true story of Godzilla 2014 can be told."
"vake","3","3","7","8 September 2014"," The adventures of idiotic, boring people with a quick cameo of Godzilla
","The trailers made me think this was gonna be good, interesting, with some thought put into the script. It was none of those things. <br/><br/>The script was completely idiotic all the way through. All the human characters, every last one of them, were stupid and annoying. I hated them, couldn't stand them. It was one face palm after another, at all the stupid things they said and did. Unfortunately, it turns out, that's what the majority of this movie is about, showing us what all these boring, annoying people are up to.<br/><br/>The paper thin, useless human characters wouldn't be such a big problem, if the movie lived up to its title and gave us a movie about Godzilla. But this movie is 95% about the people, and only 5% about the titular monster. Sure, the 5% of Godzilla scenes are good, but if 95% of your movie stinks, you've got huge problems.<br/><br/>When they finally give us a glimpse of Godzilla, things pick up, especially when Godzilla and MUTO are about to fight, but then suddenly they cut to a kid on a sofa! After a soul crushingly boring first hour spent with some of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie, your film is on the verge of maybe, just maybe, having the first good scene, and instead you give us a shot of a kid on a sofa! Who thought this was a good idea? <br/><br/>At that point it became clear the whole film itself was designed to be just as annoying as all the characters in it. <br/><br/>The HALO jump about 1 hour 30 minutes into the movie is one of the only bright spots. It's an interesting looking scene with a good atmosphere. Unfortunately it's short, and has absolutely nothing to do with the tone of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, in the end, they give us maybe 5 minutes of Godzilla vs. the MUTO's. But it's way too little, way too late. <br/><br/>I read somewhere here, that they modeled the teasing of Godzilla on Jaws. What they SHOULD'VE copied from Jaws, is how to give us interesting and likable main characters we can care about, if that's who you want us to spend 95% of your movie watching. To call the family ""Brody"" in this film, was an insult to Jaws."
"unemployedvirgin","3","3","7","7 September 2014"," WTF! Disappointed!!!
","When the viral trailer hit YouTube a couple months back, this looked like one of the most promising films to watch in 2014. After having to sit through 2 agonising hours that statement couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>As one reviewer said, ""the film dies with Bryan Cranston"" which is about 20 minutes in. You're left with such poor storytelling that revolves around a delusional doctor wanting to save a fat dinosaur. Honestly the creature and the child actor who plays Aaron Taylor-Johnson's son both suffer from severe retardation. Poor CGI work of Godzilla, with it's thunder thighs, narrow shoulders, midget arms and blue flamed fire breath. It pretty much looks the same as the old black and white renditions of the series....weak at best. The 1998 version sh*ts on this easily and that was what..16 years ago? I'm not even a fan-boy of this monster saga yet even me! the average movie goer can clearly see a stinker here.<br/><br/>If that wasn't enough, the prime focus of the movie then shifts to the most ridiculous looking monsters to ever grace the silver screen. Mutos......robotic looking, insect like, egg carrying and radioactive eating giant spider ants. The radiation element is just laughable, might as well add some krypton related references in the cinematography.<br/><br/>Honestly did they hire writers comprising of pre-school children to conjure this up? Then these inbred ""things"" duke it out for what seems like a never ending sloppy fight to the death. With the entire focus of the second half focusing on firing a nuke at these sea mutants, the damn thing never even goes off! Oh but the worst part is yet to come...<br/><br/>The film basically ends with Godzilla being PRAISED (of all things) for saving the day, in killing off the ""spider-ants"". The obese lizard then lumbers its way slowly back into the ocean and then...roll credits......WTF!!! I'm sorry but I was under the impression that a monster film revolves around...well...the monster being the antagonist not a bloody hero! <br/><br/>Poor choice of overall casting (Elizabeth Olsen looks like an anorexic 8 year old portraying a grown woman's PMS cycle every scene she's in). Predictable dialogue with the only two noteworthy quotes already shown in the trailer. Cranston & Aaron are the only two actors that keep this garbage afloat before it sinks like the turd that it is. Don't believe the hype, save your time/money for something worth your intelligence. With a sequel in the works I shudder to think what is coming next. Gareth Edwards...you sir are a f@gg0t."

This movie was as dark and gritty as the original and what the trailers looked like, it just wasn't scary enough.

"francois_felix5","2","3","7","27 August 2014"," may be a good movie, if you are retarded
","I think this is the most predictable movie i have ever seen. The coincidences are ridiculous. <br/><br/>When the M.U.T.O escape in Japan, it is said to Ford that a plane will bring him to Hawaii and there another plane will take him to San Francisco. Guess where the MUTO goes... It goes directly in Hawaii and after that it is going in the direction of San Francisco...<br/><br/>It seems like there's clues in the movies to predict what is going to happen. At the beginning, Ford get asked by his son if he will still be there the next day. I think they made that to create emotions, to make us care about them. When I saw that, I just thought: That means Ford won't be there the next day. Those predictable scenes always remind me that it's just a movies with scenes created only to create emotions to us. That's exactly what it takes to make me careless about the protagonist. <br/><br/>When we learn that Ford is a specialist in defusing bombs, it is evident in this movie that in a important part of the movie, he will need to defuse one.<br/><br/>So there's not a little bit of suspense and logic in the events succession. <br/><br/>What about logic. An atomic bomb explodes somewhere like a mile away from A lot of peoples. And it is supposed the be a very powerful atomic bomb. The result: Nothing, not even deadly radiations... And we are in a movie all about radiations.<br/><br/>Seems like army doesn't care about soldier's life and money. Helicopters and jets are ineffective against the monsters because MUTOs send EMPs and it always makes the helicopters and planes crashes. But they keep sending a lot. Why? I guess it is just to create more spectacular scenes.<br/><br/>Do all the fights are happening at night !? I mean, every time there's a fight or just an action scene, it's outside but it's dark. And there are sort of dark clouds and mist. Why the hell? Not only it is unexplained and not logical but it makes the action scenes awful. We cannot see anything but some parts of the monsters appearing and vanishing in the dark. Plus there's often big flashes. <br/><br/>That bring us to the action. There's only few and like I said, we can't see.<br/><br/>Godzilla may be nice to see of you are stupid or if you are a child. Because you won't notice those illogical things and the predictable scenes.<br/><br/>But if you are intelligent, you will notice that. You may notice that this scene is surely there to create sadness and this other one is to create happiness but the movie would have been the same without them. So you won't feel anything and you won't care about anybody in the movie. And plus you will see no interesting action. You will not be surprised at any point of the movie. There's no humor ,sex scenes...<br/><br/>I'm just trying to find good aspects of the movie but I can't find and i'm starting to wonder if it is really worth 2/10... I would give 1.5/10 if I could, just because 1/10 is the absolute worst and I think this is still possible to make a worse movie."
"TheMarwood","5","3","7","25 August 2014"," Well made, but doesn't deliver
","While a good portion of the first act teases with glimpses of the big 'ol fella, after his unveil it continues to tease by cutting away to uninteresting story lines and ultimately becomes a frustrating experience. One dimensional and incredibly bland human characters do nothing to hold our attention, while we impatiently wait for some oversized well rendered pixels to level cities and fight each other. There are some exciting, well directed set pieces, but they feel like bookends to some truly atrocious human drama. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is so vanilla as a lead and has such little screen presence, that if they digitally erased him from every scene, I probably wouldn't even notice. Elizabeth Olsen feels tacked on last minute into this narrative and she has nothing to work with and Bryan Cranston mugs for the camera. But quality human drama is not why you watch a Godzilla film, but that's really all that's served here - minus the quality."
"westfield-john","5","3","7","23 August 2014"," This movie has a mismatched title
","The movie, this movie, evolves around the existence of a Prealpha predator, named Godzilla. One positive aspect, is how this version of 'Godzilla' seems to be closer to the original version. In other words, the Monster needs another opponent than the ordinary humans. Wait! Did I say humans? No I meant the military. And not just some military, but the US military. However, there are some actors who pretend to be common civilians as well. OK, that is the story. The whole problem about this movie is its title, as a lot of such movies. Why name it Godzilla, like this would be the main actor, the most important part? No, this part belongs to General Strenz, and his military companions. The stereotype of world saving soldier, and there are a lot of them, plus their vehicles, land, sea, air. And missiles, rockets, explosions, a lot of gun fire, yes, and a school bus. In my opinion this movie's appropriate title would be, 'Another Adventure of the US military against (Westcoast) Godzilla'. Since there already was a (Eastcoast) Godzilla. they have a lot of these adventure-type films like US Army vs. 'TheBadGuy' already, the eastcoast gorilla & the super bad ass stereotype munster in new york, the whole world, the super dangerous aliens in all shades. The koreans, north. Well, you know the military, sorry, ... the story. 5 out of 10 for the nice ambiance and FX."
"brandoncharlesworth","8","3","7","28 July 2014"," Total satisfaction.
","Godzilla 2014 is the second Western Godzilla movie and it goes without saying that this was a massive improvement over the 1998 version. Director Gareth Edwards, who also directed Monsters, respects the source material and succeeds in making a Godzilla movie. The CG in this film is outstanding and Godzilla has received a somewhat new design but retains the original design in most aspects. The score by Alexandre Desplat is second best to the Dark Knight composed by Hans Zimmer, in my opinion, as it makes the listener feel small and has a menacing feel. Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are spectacular and prove that they can do a wide variety of roles. The story is deeper and, dare I say, better than the previous Toho movies as it includes conspiracies and military aspects. This movie is well directed and is really suspenseful and action-packed. However, for a movie called Godzilla, Godzilla is only in the movie for around half an hour, considering it is a 2 hour movie. Same for Bryan Cranston, who is also only in the movie for the first 30 minutes, considering he dominated the trailers and was by far the best actor in the film. Apart from Ken Watanabe, the other actors were quite weak and you didn't care about them. This mainly goes for Aaron Taylor Johnson, who I do like as an actor. But he is the main character and delivers a stale and emotionless performance. With that said, this movie was a good experience and is a love letter to the original Toho movies. Don't go into this movie expecting a massive Godzilla-fest, because you might be let down. If there is an extended DVD/ Blu ray release I will be really happy. I will give Godzilla 2014 an 8 out of 10, hopefully Gareth Edwards learns from his mistakes and delivers with the sequel."
"schrilax","2","3","7","5 July 2014"," consider giving this a skip
","Bryan Cranston was the only bright spot in the movie.<br/><br/>(Q) How I felt about the movie ?<br/><br/>It started off well. In fact I would say the first 30 minutes or so, was the best part of the movie. This says a lot about the movie since there were no creature effects in that duration. I love the science fiction / horror/ thriller genres and hoped to see plenty of creature stuff. I did not expect to see a movie from the drama genre. It was a developing plot and I said ""Okay, let's see how it goes."".<br/><br/>(Q) what was i really expecting to see ?<br/><br/>I was hoping to see plenty of action. Among it raw gore, plain carnality, lots of destruction/damage of property. You know carnage (read: destruction of tanks, fighter jets, ships, bridges, buildings, etc.). A good boss fight in the end would be welcome but definitely not expected.<br/><br/>Let us face it. Godzilla is a monster and I certainly did not expect it to know its manners and leave after finishing off the two monsters waving goodbye to the people around it. It even took care not to step over anyone while it was leaving. Like a true hero, who did not even wait for people to applaud for him. <br/><br/>(Q) What really got me annoyed/fuming about the movie ?<br/><br/>The plot. I mean what the hell was happening out there. Why the hell do I care about Ford Brody's wife or his son and what they do. Did I pay to see a drama ? No, I paid to see a monster flick. <br/><br/>The other scenes of Ford Brody with that Japanese kid and soldiers were equally exasperating. I was like ""Get out of my face."" I was literally cringing whenever Ford Brody or his family made an appearance. <br/><br/>I thought the plot was really stupid. <br/><br/>a) Why wasn't the entire city which ended up as the meeting place evacuated before the battle began ? <br/><br/>b) Why do you have to fight a monster with plenty of people on a bridge ? What sort of army/police allows this to happen ?<br/><br/>c) Why can't you move your ships out of the way to prevent them from getting destroyed when you know not one but three monsters are coming there ? This after having ships follow Godzilla wherever it went (like paparazzi for celebrities) <br/><br/>d) Why did Godzilla want to destroy the two other monsters and again its eggs ? How did Godzilla know where the monsters were going and what they intended to do ? Why does Godzilla let those follower ships follow him wherever he goes ?<br/><br/>e) When you decide to let Godzilla kill the two monsters why do you have to let the monsters get even anywhere close to armed bombs, knowing fully well your own army is helpless ?<br/><br/>f) Why does Godzilla love to fight in the dark and only in the dark ?<br/><br/>g) What was the need for so many unnecessary characters in the movie who you could have really done without ? <br/><br/>h) Did you really have to do the mating and 'nest in the city' thing ? I mean can't we have Godzilla simply destroy the monsters just because they threatened his existence rather than Godzilla act as mankind's savior and destroy the monster colonies ?<br/><br/>(Q) What was the most disappointing part of the movie for me ? <br/><br/>a) Ken Watanabe (such a waste of his talent !!) <br/><br/>b) Thought the movie had plenty of potential and it being reduced to nothing."

And even more!It represents extremely well the force of nature as it was planned to do. A great scenario for great actors and actresses. Epicness, pure madness, some really poetic moments of destruction and of freedom.Sometimes, when Godzilla roars, I was(and it's true!), holding the armrests of the sit as he was taking his breath; and when he finally releases his roar, this is purely astonishingly awesome! Everything is here to spend two hours, (not that long, actually), in a really great joy. They show us that despite the fact they are monsters, the closest living creature from the Mutos are the spiders, and Godzilla, the lizard, obviously; this shows us one thing: the monsters(all of them), are humanized. But i won't tell more to avoid any spoilers. The man is the species which is actually shown like the real monster, with all those nuclear weapons unfairly threw on innocent people. Just go watch this movie in theaters, without 3d, it will give a better look at the special effects, especially for the monsters, I believe!"

","After 60 years, Godzilla proves that he is still the boss! <br/><br/>I've been trying to be patient waiting for this movie ever since I saw the Oppenheimer teaser trailer at San Diego Comic-Con last year but it was too hard. However, finally, I got to see it in IMAX 3D and it was everything I wantedand then Godzilla came in and tail-whipped and atomic breathed my expectations into the stratosphere and beyond.<br/><br/>Other than having a minor complaint of wanting to see more of some characters (and believe me, this was an extremely minor complaintto the point it pretty much doesn't exist), the film is incredible. Director Gareth Edwards did a tremendous job of really giving Godzilla that sense of scale he deserves (and that matters since this is the largest presentation of the King of all Kaiju we've ever seen) and the story Edwards showed was capable of being a non-stop thriller of a monster movie, a knock-down/drag-out creature battle and a story of humans feeling inadequate against the mighty power of nature itself.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed everything about this film and it proved to be what summer blockbuster popcorn epics are supposed to be. The scope is huge, the cast is superb, the story is fantastic, the special effects are enough to make the tin foil hat conspiracy theorists take a break from false flag theories to ones that Obama engineered a radioactive lizard and make them believe what they are watching is a documentary, and the action is exciting and worthy of some of the best in Godzilla's long and rich history.<br/><br/>And I can't forget the soundoh man, the sound is so great in this film. There's nothing like hearing that iconic roar and feel it rumble your seat like the beast himself is outside the theater! My anticipation for ""Godzilla"" was high but it was met and exceeded with this reboot to the franchise. I know giant monster movies don't have the greatest history of performing well at the box office here in the States but, Man Alive, I sure hope this makes bank at the box office because I want to see several sequels with this new Godzilla.<br/><br/>Hey there!

"johnnymacbest","9","3","7","25 May 2014"," Best Godzilla film in years!!!
","Wow, what an incredible movie. Granted, the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but the human drama and sense of peril is much more believable than Roland Emmerich's shlock 1998 remake; which despite having some entertaining moments, never captured the dark tone of the 1954 classic monster flick that introduced to the world one of the most beloved and iconic monsters of all time, the G-Man!!! I came in with low expectations, but when all hell breaks loose and the situation becomes more and more dire, that's when things get REALLY exciting. The fight between Godzilla and the Mutos, is nothing short of exhilarating. I only wish that the fights were longer and more intense and not so much focus on the human characters, but in the case of this film, it's justified in getting the audience to have sympathy for the human protagonists, but me personally, I was more enamored with the G-Man, than the humans; mainly stemming from the fact that I'm a HUGE Godzilla fan, and have been wanting to see a film in his original glory for years. Thankfully, it delivered, and by the box-office business this film is doing, we'll be seeing the G-Man in another massive monster mash in the future.<br/><br/>Great film. Best one in the franchise I've seen for a long time."

","Man's relationship with nature is like poking a bear. We poke and push its being, but rather than no longer suffering our presence, it simply paws and kills us in reflex like something insignificant. We're nothing to a bear, a komodo dragon, an eagle, or even a Godzilla.<br/><br/>But we are something to each other, especially where family is concerned. Unfortunately for Ford Brody, tragedy and estrangement strike his family at a young age. Emotionally drained from his past and military life, glimmers of happiness and spots of denial cross his face during intimate moments with his own family. But as estrangement leaves, responsibility follows. It's the last time Ford's emotions truly take over, as he steels himself to face the monsters of his past, protecting his family and humanity alike.<br/><br/>His wife and son, Elle and Sam, are unfortunately blank slates. Believable in personality, acting as any family would, but frivolous beyond their roles as the people Ford MUST keep safe. Joining Ford is the level-headed Admiral Stenz, someone willing to go to any lengths to stop the monsters, but guilty enough to know what those lengths might entail. And joining Stenz is Serizawa, a half scientist, half cultist, and all enigmatic person studying the monsters on the loose.<br/><br/>The film is shy about letting any of its characters express their inner psyche, but this isn't about who they are on the inside. It's about who they are on the outside, on their actions, realistic responses to the monsters running amok from Japan to America. There's little in the way of jokes from them, being black humor at most, before the faces of Ford and his men tremble in disciplined fear as they're often too close for comfort with the monsters.<br/><br/>And even when anyone is far away from the monsters, the effects of their presence still shows. Sometimes the ocean sweeps in their wake, other times it's like a solar flare or earthquake invaded whatever city they strolled through. They don't have it out for humanity; they are simply animals awoken, doing their own thing, but with a nuclear-age sentience that makes them as identifiable as any of the people in this film.<br/><br/>Oops, I went from a casual look at the monsters but it magnified into a metaphor for nature's wrath. To the say the film represents nature getting back at us for not fixing climate change would be an exaggeration though. SomeTIMEs there's deeper meaning, but it's otherwise simply a story of how people would react to giant monsters mucking about. And unlike the deeper aspects of its human cast, the film isn't shy about showing the beautifully crafted destruction that increases in scale and frequency as the story goes on.<br/><br/>Nor is it shy with its soundtrack. The opening sequence is a throwback to monster films of old, but composed with enough care to make this noticeable as a modern piece. This, and the rest of the music, is fully realized orchestra that creates a memorable soundtrack and unforgettable tone for the film. And of course, the blood-curdling roar from Godzilla is never short on its unnerving dissonance, while the other monsters cries are understated but demand all the more attention for it.<br/><br/>But since I mentioned 'attention,' that brings me to something crucial I need to mention.<br/><br/>Godzilla isn't fast-food entertainment. It takes the time to realize its human characters, but they're far from being the most complex around. The story is rich on how they deal with the monsters' presence, but poor on keeping an impatient viewer hooked because of its punishingly slow pace. There's action, but people deceived into believing this is just an action film can be disappointed.<br/><br/>Enjoying Godzilla requires an ability to ignore smaller aspects individually, as the film is more than the sum of its parts. More than the human drama anchoring it. More than the monsters running amok. More than 100 meters tall, rising from the depths, is a monstrous star ready to show the world he's still got it. He shows his Hollywood age at 60 years, but Godzilla still proves to be King of the Monsters."

","Despite the critics and a few bad reviews I thoroughly enjoyed Godzilla. Its a bit different to most other films that our out at the minute.<br/><br/>I don't understand the critics that were saying that Godzilla was to fat, He looked awesome and we wouldn't really want to be seeing something based around the image of the previous godzilla movie. It was more believable as a pre-dinosaur era monster, I especially liked the blue flame/energy that he shot out of his mouth, nice touch. <br/><br/>If you wanna see a decent monster movie that has a huge budget and names such as Brian Cranston in then you'll love this"
"kluseba","7","3","7","21 May 2014"," A solid comeback for my childhood hero
","I have grown up with the classic Japanese Godzilla movies that I first discovered when I was around eight or nine years old. I liked so many things about these movies: the looks of the monsters, the epic battle scenes, the different technical gimmicks, the detailed and handmade special effects, the emotional soundtracks, the diversified side stories and many references to Japanese culture. When I saw the first American ""Godzilla"" adaption as a child, I was rather disappointed and thought of it as a missed attempt at putting a ""Jurassic Park"" monster in a metropolis. As a child, I was then asking my parents to find the first original Godzilla movie that I had heard and read about and when my father finally came home with a videotape of it, I preferred this dark, diversified, philosophical movie that explored at least four genres at the same time (being a detailed action movie, a philosophical drama, a bleak horror movie and an innovating science-fiction film) to any movie I had ever seen before. Until today, the original movie from 1954 is one of my all-time favourite films and a classic any cineaste must see.<br/><br/>Until today, I have watched almost all Godzilla movies and while I adore most of them (my favourites being ""Godzilla"" (1954), ""Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster"" (1964), ""Invasion of Astro-Monster"" (1965), ""Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla"" (1974), ""The Return Of Godzilla"" (1984), ""Godzilla versus King Ghidorah"" (1991) and ""Godzilla versus Destoroyah"" (1995) among others), I thought it was a good idea to end the series with the fiftieth anniversary and a last epic movie called ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" back in 2004 because the franchise started to run out of ideas. Ten years later, the world's most famous Kaiju is back. As a longtime fan I was excited that my childhood hero was back on screen but on the other side I felt that everything had been said about Godzilla and that the first American movie was of a low average quality at best.<br/><br/>While the new movie is nothing revolutionary and not a far call from many classic Japanese movies without reaching the perfection of the unbeatable original, the new film is much better than the first American Godzilla movie. <br/><br/>I liked the slow start of the movie including a scientific story that is slightly inspired by the original but also by current events as the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The strongest acting parts of the movie can be seen in the first thirty minutes or so and immediately get you into the story. The idea of two new monsters that would compete with Godzilla took me a little bit by surprise and really goes back to the Japanese classics which is a positive fact for a longtime fan. The final battle scenes in San Francisco are entertaining and visually stunning. Most importantly, the looks of Godzilla are great and feature all trademarks fans like about him from his atomic breath to his unique roars. The king of monsters looks a little bit bigger and heavier than the original but I think it looks extremely beautiful. Maybe Godzilla almost looks too sympathetic which is reminding me of the movies of the sixties and seventies rather than the original film or the last Japanese films. In comparison to the last few movies of the franchise, Godzilla is actually playing a the role of a hero and not a villain again which was another positive surprise to me.<br/><br/>Obviously, there are also a few minor negative elements in here. Apart of the great and touching first thirty minutes or so, the acting in this movie is a little bit wooden and stereotypical. I'm sorry to say this but child actor Carson Bolde is one of the worst of its kind. His character almost doesn't speak, has only one facial expression and looks like he had a severe Down syndrome. While watching the first thirty minutes, I thought it was going to be an extraordinary movie but a few lengths and the lack of high quality acting made the final result a very good film but not an absolute highlight. Another really negative element is that Godzilla almost only plays a secondary role in this movie apart of the last thirty minutes. The king of monsters doesn't have much screening time but once it is there, it really shines. The movie rather focuses on the two other monsters. I don't want to spoil anything but the two new monsters look somewhat artificial and have no unique charisma. The story around these two monsters had some potential but they are mostly unimpressive in the end and among the most boring opponents Godzilla ever had. On a side note, let's add that the soundtrack of this movie is unimpressive and never comes close to the emotional and epic Japanese soundtracks.<br/><br/>In the end, the first thirty minutes of the movie are creative and intense while the final battle scenes in the last thirty minutes are entertaining and epic at some points. In between, the weak acting, the lack of screen time for Godzilla and the unimpressive new monsters slow the pace of the movie a little bit down. Fans of the franchise might analyze this film as a good and solid comeback but no extraordinary one. Enjoy and watch it without further hesitation if you are still undecided. After all, the new looks of Godzilla and its unique charisma (yes, a monster can have charisma and it's probably the best ""actor"" in this movie) left me wanting more by the end of the movie. This is a well done tribute to the classics with convincing settings from the Phillipines over Japan to Hawaii and San Francisco. The special effects are as stunning as you can expect. I would call this movie a solid success after all. I'm in love with my childhood hero again and really hope Godzilla will be back."
"saytosandeep","8","3","7","21 May 2014"," MY REVIEW: Godzilla Returns Big Time!!
","Godzilla. If you loved Godzilla version of 1998, then this Godzilla will tell you loved a fake Godzilla. In this 2014 version, Godzilla returns in its pure ancient form where he is quite distant in size and behavior from lost race of dinosaurs. This movie works because it's a sincere cocktail of monstrous beasts, their fights, illusion of humans that they can control the nature, heroism of Godzilla, right amount of suspense, drama and emotional connect through well etched characters. First half is a bit slow, takes its time to create the felling of danger but second half makes sure that you do not blink your eyes otherwise you can miss the finest CGI effects done for a monster movie. The noisy roar mixed with emotionless eyes of Godzilla helps establishing Godzilla as the ruthless hunter. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Godzilla. If you are already fan of this monster then you can't afford to miss it. If you are first timer then you would end up being a fan."
"OlieRendch","8","3","7","21 May 2014"," Story, visual effects and all-round feel of the movie have improved drastically since the 1998 version, but still fans aren't happy?
","When I first heard they were remaking Godzilla I thought to myself that the Roland Emmerich one wasn't too bad and that there were better films to be made. Of course I was using memories from my childhood sitting on the sofa watching a huge dinosaur-thing smashing around New York. Come to 2014 though and through various leaks, posters, announcements etc. I'm starting to get into the Zilla mood, and then one day I saw the teaser trailer. The best trailer I've ever sen in my life. That brought me on board for definite. So after seeing the movie and hearing how divided the fans are I was a tad disappointed, not by the movie, just how many didn't like it. To me this new Godzilla was a very atmospheric movie, the feel of it can sometimes send shivers down your spine, the sounds it creates and the music by far make it what it is. The film also grounds itself into realism too, don't go in expecting Pacific Rim, this is very different regarding execution, it doesn't show Godzilla every five minutes, it focuses a lot on the human story, almost as if the giant destructive forces of nature now appearing were like a back-drop. That I think that is where it lost a lot of its fans; I myself thought it was interesting way to go and didn't mind it. Don't get me wrong you do see full shots of Godzilla and what he does which are some of the best scenes in cinema, the CGI is barley worth mentioning as of course it's going to be fantastic. As a film critic though I do have to share my negative points and that was that one or two times there are instances where unrealistic things happen concerning locating a massive creature (or lack of) which do take you out of the movie. Other than that and what I would say quite an abrupt ending Godzilla 2014 was time well spent."
"sesht","Null","3","7","21 May 2014"," Torn - decently disappointing / disappointingly decent
","A mixed baggage, decidedly. Forget about the casting, esp. when there's not much meat there to go around. Everyone around me was criticizing Olsen, Cranston, Watanabe, Strathairn and Binoche for slumming it, but hey, we all need our paychecks. The less said about Taylor-Johnson and Hawkins (and the child actors inhabiting this one), the better.<br/><br/>I myself was curious about how they would try to better the sheer awesomeness that pervaded each and every sequence in 'Pacific Rim'. Well, they didn't. They did do something different, by ensuring that the monster-on-monster action was wholly filmed from a human perspective, and that Gojira himself was more a savior, a figurehead of tragedy, a la King Kong, but this one doesn't have the Beauty and the Beast motif going for it that puts us firmly in the protagonists' corner. <br/><br/>In terms of scale, this one has it in spades. In terms of plot though, its all meh.<br/><br/>There are quite a few action sequences that warrant a mention, and even perhaps a repeat viewing: 1. The train transport sequence, 2. The passenger train sequence, in spite of it being awfully short, 3. The final monster-on-monster action, once again, dramatically short, for a movie that has a 2-hour runtime.<br/><br/>The CGI is fantastic, with not one frame looking out of sorts. No mean achievement, that.<br/><br/>However, it saddened me to note that the reviled director responsible for the atrocity that was the 1998 version, is responsible for works that have way better characterization like (even) 2012, The day after tomorrow, Independence day et al. Incredibly ironic. The big mistake was in following 1 family. Emmerich gave us multiple perspectives in ID, and though that was one dumb B-flick, we'd all find someone to root for, and stuck with them all the way (even friggin' Randy Quaid).<br/><br/>The dumbness. Oh, the plot that serves nothing more than make the movie plod on, clod by clod.......it pervades most frames, right from the time-lines to the sequences set within the quarantine region (floppy diskettes? really?). After a time, I gave up caring. (To be fair, I didn't put my thinking hat on while watching, but typing this, I'm mostly thinking ""huh! huh? HUH????"".)<br/><br/>Unexpected from someone with the pedigree that Gareth Edwards has. I really dug his work in 'Monsters', and feel that he should get back to low budget, Indie filmmaking. This one needed Del Toro.<br/><br/>And the 3D? An absolute waste. People should re-watch 'Avatar' and 'Pacific Rim', make notes, and then at least try to ape those well-worn works on how 3D would make your frames come to life. Given the choice, I'd prefer watching Pacific Rim once again over this, but its not bad for a 1-time watch in 2D. And believe me, I wanted to like this one."
"gibas311","7","3","7","21 May 2014"," Godzilla returns triumphant!!
","First of all, we needed this reboot!! 10 years after the crazy and awesome Japanese flick Godzilla: Final Wars, we have a reboot that has the same urgency feel of the original, released in 1954 and directed by the kaiju master Ishiro Honda (Rodan, Mothra, Space Amoeba).<br/><br/>The drama part feels kinda hurried and unsympathetic - Aaron Taylor- Johnson's fault - but the rest of the movie, counting the King of the Monsters, the new monsters called MUTOs and Bryan Cranston (with a little of Ken Watanabe in the mix), make the 123 minutes pass too fast.<br/><br/>All in all, Godzilla is back and he wants his throne back!!<br/><br/>Thank you Gareth Edwards!!"
"Jonathon_Natsis","7","3","7","21 May 2014"," Is the big guy back with a roar or a whimper?
","It was always going to be a task of kaiju-sized proportions. After Roland Emmerich's (perhaps unfairly) maligned shot at Godzilla in 1998 – his titular lizard reduced to the disparaging title of 'Godzilla-in-name-only' by many fans – it took almost twenty years before an American studio would again have its hands on one of the biggest stars of Eastern cinema. So do Gareth Edwards (Monsters) and his bang-up cast do the monster justice? The answer is a resoundingsort of.<br/><br/>Fifteen years after losing his wife in a freak accident in Japan, engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) enlists the help of his army lieutenant son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to break into the site of the mishap – now designated as a quarantine zone – to learn how she really died. Finding the zone to be completely non-toxic, he stumbles upon a giant cocoon housing a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). When the creature escapes and begins scouring the world to mate with more of its kind, it is up to Godzilla to awake from his ancient slumber and restore balance to the earth.<br/><br/>As far as holiday blockbusters go, this is about as unconventional as they come. Short of seeing giant monsters rumbling in the concrete jungle, forget every other plot point you might expect going in, because chances are things won't pan out that way. The film takes virtually every convention of the typical monster movie and tips it on its head. For instance, Godzilla is neither hero nor villain; his actions are totally selfish; and, in a refreshing change of pace, he has no beef with us humans, even though we give him every reason to squash us into oblivion. We're not bearing witness to an Oscar-winning screenplay in mid-May by any means, but Edwards earns top marks for trying his very best to deliver something truly original.<br/><br/>Speaking of original, this iteration of Godzilla stays infinitely more faithful to his Japanese ancestor than G.I.N.O's go-round. It's out with the lanky arms, lean legs and love of fine seafood, and back in with the humanoid physique, tail whip and atomic breath, the latter of which paves the way for the film's most gleeful fatality. <br/><br/>It's only fair that human characters should take a back seat in a mega movie like this, but even this top-notch cast can't lift the laziness of their characters. Both Cranston and Ken Watanabe's kaiju expert are criminally underused for entirely different reasons, leaving Taylor-Johnson with the impossible task of breathing life into the film's most boring character. <br/><br/>As for the beasties, some may approve of the slow-burn reveal – Godzilla himself chills out for almost two-thirds of the runtime before appearing in full form – harking back to classic cryptids like Jaws, Alien and Predator, but before you know it, the climactic fight is over and the big guy barely even feels like the star of his own movie. It's almost as if they're planning for him show up again sometime soon. Oh wait <br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"

","I have watched all the old Godzilla movies in colour, but the one from 1998 disappointed me a lot. I did not know what to expect from the new one and I have watched the trailer a couple of times, but I will not spoil it for you. If you like action and Sci-Fi a lot, like I do, you will not get disappointed.<br/><br/>Last Friday some friends and I, had an arrangement about watching this new version of Godzilla. We agreed to watch the 3D version of the movie. The 3D really gives the movie that extra WOW! effect and with the THX sound system, I was literally blown away in the cinema! Watch it in 3D and bring your friends or family for an awesome movie watching experience. You will not get disappointed and even though I find the trailer ""boring"", the movie is absolutely NOT boring! Sitting on the edge of your seat or holding your breath, is also a part of the action, and ""oh no, are they going to make it?!"" experience.<br/><br/>Would I consider watching this movie in the cinema again? Heck yes I would! And in fact I have invited my parents to the cinema today, and we are going to watch Godzilla together in 3D. I have also told my friends and colleagues about how awesome the new Godzilla movie is. Godzilla is a, ""you have to watch it in the cinema"", movie. To top it off, I love 3D and Godzilla has changed how movies should be watched in the cinema.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this movie? Indeed I will and what are you waiting for?!

Bryan Cranston performance is great, Aaron Taylor Johnson was good, so Elizabeth Olsen, and Ken Watanbe.<br/><br/>The effects are terrific, Godzilla is awesome, not over done like in the 1998 film, those scenes are will have you on the edge of your seat.

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","6","3","7","20 May 2014"," Dull as dishwater
","There are times when I just feel out of step with the average moviegoer, and watching the latest Godzilla film in a packed movie theater was one of those times. Godzilla was met with constant cheering and clapping from the audience. But I don't think the movie ever built momentum, suspense, or tension, nor did the characters provide a compelling human element. Godzilla was a flat out bore to me.<br/><br/>I can't really express my disappointment with this movie without revealing crucial plot elements; so if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading this now. The film begins with scientist Ishiro Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe), who arrives at a quarry in the Philippines where two ancient, giant fossilized eggs have been found – one appears to have hatched. In the meantime, two nuclear engineers in Japan, Joe Brody (played by Bryan Cranston) and his wife Sandra Brody (played by Juliette Binoche) have detected disturbing seismic readings underneath their power plant. The power plant melts down and Joe Brody is forced to seal a few engineers in the core, including his wife, in one of the most painful scenes of the movie. Cranston suspects that the government is hiding something about the nuclear power plant's melt down, and it's obvious to the audience that it has something to do with the eggs that Ken Watanabe found.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Cranston, fraught with guilt, is obsessed with discovering what exactly happened to cause the meltdown. His son Ford, a military veteran played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, has moved on and has a wife (Elisabeth Olson) and a child of his own. Ford's return from a tour of duty in the Middle East is cut short when his father is arrested in Japan for attempting to trespass on the nuclear power plant site. They discover that a monster that feeds on radiation caused the meltdown - but it is not Godzilla, as you might think. No, the culprit is only referred to as a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism), a giant moth-like creature that destroys everything in its path through brute force and its ability to emit an EMP blast. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is lost in the ensuing destruction. The movie does not really spend much time mourning Cranston as the MUTO quickly calls out to another bigger and badder MUTO that has awoken in California. As Serizawa and Ford work to figure out a way to stop these creatures, the key to their destruction comes from an unlikely source - Godzilla. Godzilla has awoken as well, and he is on the hunt for some MUTO meat. <br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards takes a different approach with this movie than you might expect, focusing on the humans of the story rather than the monsters. I can certainly appreciate his effort. Overexposure of the monsters might make them lose their impact after a while. But none of the characters are well defined or particularly interesting. Aaron-Taylor Johnson's personality is dull as dishwater and the writers did not really give him any compelling traits. The only character that could have had any kind of interesting arc was Cranston considering the enormous guilt he feels about his wife's death, but he dies within the first twenty minutes. The movie loses its most interesting character far too soon. <br/><br/>The film is only partially redeemed by the action. The action scenes have a very dark, apocalyptic feel, epitomizing the 9/11 fears that have crept into American movies for the past thirteen years. The monsters themselves look amazing and there are definitely some cheer worthy moments when Godzilla kicks serious butt. The last thirty minutes are a TON of fun! <br/><br/>Before the end of the movie though, the action scenes are always cut short, which is a surefire way to take me out of a film. There is never any sense that the stakes were getting higher as the film went on. Perhaps if the human stories were more interesting this approach could have worked, but it just resulted in a very boring movie. <br/><br/>The movie's largest problem is that Godzilla is just a supporting character in his own movie, as Christopher Orr pointed out in the Atlantic. The movie isn't really ABOUT Godzilla; it's about the MUTOs. And I just don't care about MUTOs. <br/><br/>It's clear that a lot of people LOVE this movie though, so there's a pretty good chance you will like it too. I'm just glad that I skipped out on IMAX though, that would have been a real waste of money for me."
"Taylor_McCleve","8","3","7","20 May 2014"," An Excellent Return to the Godzilla's Roots
","This is the Godzilla movie I was hoping I would see back in 1998, when Roland Emmerich's entry into the franchise was released. This time around, director Gareth Edwards took all the best aspects of his 2010 indie Monsters and a healthy respect for the original Godzilla films to create what is easily this generation's Jurassic Park. In fact, the first quarter of the film was incredibly reminiscent of the opening of Michael Crichton's book, which focused heavily on several characters trying to figure out where these strange, unidentifiable creatures were coming from.<br/><br/>Unlike Emmerich's ode to Michael Bay-stylized vapidness, Edwards managed to pack a surprising amount of soul into a movie about prehistoric monsters using skyscrapers to beat the crap out of each other. While Emmerich's version had a cast full of talented actors, the writing was so god-awful that there wasn't much for the cast to do but stand there and look surprised as New York was leveled. This time around, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Johnson, Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, and Elizabeth Olsen have a well-crafted script to work off of, which makes the film all that much stronger because the audience has the chance to actually care about the people whose world is literally being rocked.<br/><br/>With an actual plot, fully-realized characters, and a never-ending sense of tension throughout, Godzilla is the best in its genre since 2008's excellent (but polarizing) Cloverfield."

There is only a slight difference of Japan and America, because the People everywhere look American. The American soldiers use laughable guns against Godzilla, thats poor! :) In Germany, Brian Cranston sounds the same as Walter White in Breaking Bad. There is no Special Change in the voice, he always Sounds stressed. ;) No good Synchronisation. Cranston has to less screen time.

However the missing primary plot of the film was a nice surprise!<br/><br/>I found that the acting and characters were all very stiff, cliché and a bit boring. Personally I didn't find myself caring for any of them. <br/><br/>No one really had a prime role in the film apart from the son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) everyone appeared to be a kind of side show with far too much chatter going on and no real feeling. <br/><br/>I didn't really get the feeling of fear, shock or any genuine reaction from anyone when the Monster first appears and starts causing chaos. It was all very underwhelming. <br/><br/>However, when it came to the battles, explosions and CGI work it was quite something. Godzilla really had a darker tone to its design and it was nice to see him shown to have actual intelligence and not just be a mindless Monster bent on destroying everything and eating all the fish.

How much did they pay you?? or you are a dumb punk?? and some other told that this is far more and many times better than 1998 GODZILLA, Again i can see a fool with no idea of what he is talking. I felt 1998 GODZILLA is the best one till date. TRUST ME..<br/><br/>In fact, Godzilla did a cameo appearance in this movie. Thats it!! <br/><br/>WORST MOVIE ever and Don't BELIEVE in trailer. This movie is nice when only those scenes from trailer are seen in the screen. Apart from it is full of *****."
"bobbygyorfi","3","3","7","19 May 2014"," Was Godzilla even in this movie?
","The movie is called ""Godzilla,"" but I think Godzilla was shown for a total of 10 minutes. This version is more of the radioactive, laser-beam shooting Godzilla - the complete opposite of the 1998 version of Godzilla. From the start, you can tell the movie was making Godzilla out to be the good guy (kind of like King Kong - he destroys the city, but then they make you feel bad for him). The acting was very poor, and the movie just didn't seem to flow at all. The characters were doing things that made little to no sense, and nobody seemed to really care that giant radioactive monsters were killing people. It felt like I was watching a poor late-90s / early 2000s movie. Not to mention Bryan Cranston's character dies (in a very anti-climactic way) before the main part of the movie even begins (and nobody even cares, not even his son or daughter-in-law). At one point, there is a scene of the main characters' old house, which was destroyed over 15 years ago. It is completely overgrown, the walls have collapsed and the foundation is torn apart. And yet the ""Happy Birthday"" banner that the father's son made is still hanging up (those are some pretty strong thumb tacks). It was dumb things like this that occur throughout the movie that make you say ""Really?"" and ruin the movie."
"mrjessjess","5","3","7","18 May 2014"," ""The fans wanted Godzilla, but what we got was Saving Private Ryan.""
","Well what do we have here? A super summer movie blockbuster? or A desperate attempt by Hollywood to cash in on a foreign franchise with mainstream appeal? Let's find out, as I go skin deep into this monster of a movie.<br/><br/>-GODZILLA PURISTS BEWARE - Whenever a ""Murican"" attempt at Godzilla is addressed fans automatically get up in arms about the disaster piece that was Godzilla '98, but hope among hope that something more along the lines of Godzilla 2000 is released on a bigger scale. Back then, mistakes were made,and hopefully lessons were learned when it comes to adaptation and homage. Godzilla fans know that TOHO co. is Godzilla & that all the rest are merely imitations but one can't help but admire the attempt to finally get Godzilla right in his journey to an over seas audience. However the fear and of the failure from 98 still looms large.<br/><br/>The Trailers and advertisements for this film gave us such hope and filled our hearts with anticipation, but how did it pay off? Well for all the fancy effects,big budget design, cutting edge state of the art technology,and over paid, super educated film makers that Legendary Films threw at this, you would think it would be a sure fire success, but the devil is in the details, and it's best not to count your chickens before they hatch.<br/><br/>This movie somehow failed to utilize the main ingredient...Freakin Godzilla ! ""Hello Mc Fly !"" Ya know the guy on all the posters?, the name on the ticket?, the whole reason people stopped their busy lives ,drove to the theater, and emptied their wallets? ""Do You understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?"" Yet the developers managed to screw up the single most important aspect. <br/><br/>Certainly the movie had other flaws and favorable features but to value them higher would be like scraping the crust from underneath a pie.<br/><br/>-WHO LEFT SUCH A BIG PLOT HOLE? - The beginning of the movie is a real puzzler. It really fails to establish much of anything & that which is does establish gets erased within 20 mins. It reflects a deprived use of popular actor Bryan Cranston whose character is so detached that it's absurd and quickly gets lost in environmental conspiracy a la ""2012"". The subplot of the need of the son to unite with his father is so quickly swept out from the audiences feet it will leave you looking like actor Ken Watanabe as he stares dazed and confused. This character delivers the awe struck and utterly bewildered look so many times you begin to wonder if you missed something important or if that was his only direction as an actor. Seriously how many times can he appear to be so lost in thought just before muttering a whisper of some half coherent Japanese philosophy. Likewise, the female lead couldn't have been more oblivious.<br/><br/>After a ton of hyperbole, we finally get a vague description of what's been happening. At this point I was almost beginning to wonder if Godzilla was even in this dang movie.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me understand why the director chose to spend so much time on vague., monotonous military Ops. , and pointless filler of , non recognizable characters, with little to no dialog whatsoever.<br/><br/><ul><li>THE GOODS - Aside from all that I will say the movie did manage to get some things right. The few passing moments that did include Godzilla were rightfully epic, thrilling, and inspired. They nailed the look &amp; feel of the King of Monsters, which unfortunately makes it all the more bittersweet that they didn't actually feature him more , but instead chose to beat around the bush, hide the camera behind crowds, and clutter the view with windshields wipers on high. </li></ul><br/><br/>They also felt the need to pull the cam completely away from the incredible giant monsters fighting back towards the empty streets or broken buildings.<br/><br/>Furthermore , Godzilla's adversaries, while impressive in their own right, needlessly stole precious screen time from our main attraction. After what seems like endless minuets of further military run around, the movie shifts focus to the other giant monsters. This becomes the emphasis 3 quarters of the way through this slow moving, misguided movie, while Dr. Japanese (Watanabe) has an astounding epiphany: ""Let them fight."" uhh duhh? How were you going to stop that anyway?<br/><br/>At this point you think they are saving all the Godzilla scenes for the very end, until you inevitably realize all those scenes are going to be spliced and short. However, the brief battles were worth their weight. I truly enjoyed the action. Godzilla was in top form: glorious and awe inspiring. Not only did he look astounding, he fought impressively. The hope and expectations of Godzilla lore were embarrassed and well represented as his dominance became clear from the devastating atomic energy breath, to his un mistake ably recognizable roar. I for 1 was wonderfully thankful for that.<br/><br/>The final moments of this film were basically it's only redemption in an otherwise meandering prelude of emptiness. <br/><br/><ul><li>THE ROARING CONCLUSION - If only they had spent more time &amp; creativity building up to &amp; towards Godzilla, this could have been the epic awesomeness we were all hoping for. ( 2005's King Kong was better) </li></ul><br/><br/>Perhaps next time Godzilla returns from the land of the rising sun, his presence & purpose will be the main focus and biggest priority of the story. Until then we have the dozens of Toho classics & modern movies to fill our hearts with epic roars, tail swipes, and super atomic flame breath!<br/><br/>I'm Jesse, I'm a professional writer, and I love movies."

","No better than the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick but the difference is, at least that film had its elements of camp and fun. This one is just plain dreary.<br/><br/>The first half an hour of the film is great, emotionally intense, dramatic, suspenseful but then the film degenerates in Hollywood CGI porn for the remainder of the films over 2 hour running time. The lead is also way too young, again Hollywood ageism and stupid casting, to have a son of seven or so years old. <br/><br/>The 3D was nothing short of annoying and painfully distracting in fact whilst watching this film I made a mental note to make it the last time that I see a film in 3D, all it does is remove the viewer from the experience not immerse them.<br/><br/>Overall this was not the revelatory existential monster movie I was expecting but was merely more Hollywood popcorn fodder that the teens will love but it'll leave everyone over 25 stone cold. Bitterly disappointed. Well advertised but falsely advertised - do not be fooled by the hype."
"RPMcMurphy42","4","3","7","17 May 2014"," Godzilla was disappointing
","I will try not to have spoilers but this may have a couple. I just didn't care for the movie. This is one movie where the trailers were better than the movie itself. The plot is reasonable but the delivery is lame. Travel between distant locations in seemingly no time by a ponderous beast is as bad as Jack Bauer traveling all over Los Angeles with no traffic no matter what time of day. Just too many things about the movie didn't make sense. When there is an attraction to nuclear energy and a creature travels across the Pacific Ocean, why San Francisco? There is nothing nuclear there that would warrant it as a destination. True, it was science fiction, but even science fiction needs to have some sense of reality to make it believable. Godzilla just didn't have it."
"VongolaXIKakarest","8","3","7","17 May 2014"," Do you have the time to talk about our lord and savior. Godzilla?
","The movie has so much misleading things. Such as the trailers if you see the trailer you would see a hell lot of Bryan Cranston well guess what he dies in the twenty minute mark. Yup he dies. The monsters take awfully long to appear, there is probably at most 30-40 minutes of Godzilla seen and all together there is probably about 15-20 minutes of fights but I have to admit the fights are amazing, it's quality over quantity but it lacks the proper balance between the two. Overall the story is pretty good and sort of realistic if you are not counting the part where Ford pulls off a batman and escapes the nuke in 5 minutes. The movie should have been called ""The Brody family and (in tiny font)Godzilla"" because to be honest that's all it is. Bad things: Heisenberg died Fights were way too short Shown to much of the Brody family Heisenberg died<br/><br/>Good things: Fights were amazing Godzilla is shown as a hero and savior Story was good and realistic Godzilla looked beast and bad-ass<br/><br/>Therefore I believe it should be worth a 8/10 it was okay and entertaining at times, but once again the fights were amazing. Before you ask, Yes Godzilla does have atomic blast but only uses it twice and near the end, it's much much more smaller and he spikes lights up from bottom going to top and when shown it was pretty cool but it is also much much smaller but still pretty cool. And no Godzilla does not die.<br/><br/>Also he is killing the other monsters and all they are trying to do is reproduce and kill a bunch of people (no big deal) but that shows Godzilla is the biggest cock-blocker(literally).<br/><br/>How I believe it should have ended: Godzilla shown on TV saying ""King of monsters. Savior to our city?"" and goes back into the water (yes this does actually happen) He then comes back up and says ""Didn't you motherf*ckers try to nuke me?"" Annnnnd he kills us all. The End"
"Dragonsouls","6","3","7","17 May 2014"," For the fans.
","If you are not into the Godzilla lore, then stay away from this film. You won't like it. If Godzilla mythology isn't your thing, and you simply want to see a good, visual action-flick, then skip this one. It's nothing you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>The thing with Godzilla is that it differs from other monster films, which are mostly all style and no substance. Believe it or not, Godzilla at its core is film with a message--and a film that makes you wonder what scientists are doing behind the scenes...horrible things...that destroy the Earth.<br/><br/>As a Godzilla fan, it's easy to give this film a 7/10 because I'm biased towards it. However, it is far from the best Godzilla film ever made. There was very little philosophy in the script, and only a few lines to provoke thought.<br/><br/>The acting was atrocious...and yes, atrocious is the proper word here. The only exception is the role played by Brian Cranston, who absolutely stole every scene he was in. I was however, highly disappointed in the acting of almost everyone else in the film. There was no proper display of fear coming out of everyone from the main star, Taylor Johnson, to the extras, and to the military personnel. It was bad, really, really bad! Luckily, the film looked beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful. Godzilla fans will cheer in the end. Casual fans may not."

","Godzilla is back and bigger, better and scarier.<br/><br/>Godzilla was just epic in this, he doesn't appear in probably the last hour of the film but the build up to him and hype really makes the wait worth it, and they make it special, hyping him up being the mythical creature who will once again rise up and restore balance and be the savior to our destruction.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston was great in this, he was definitely the best actor in this, the actor who played his son was kinda dull and meh, he was there but whatever.<br/><br/>The CGI was perfect, didn't look bad one bit and the Visuals looked stunning.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me with the film was it would get to a really good bit, for example, Godzilla about to fight a muto and then it would cut to another scenario and by the time that scenario is finished, the god bit is over, they did this a few times, but the final 30 minute fight with Godzilla and the muto was worth the interruptions.<br/><br/>Also I thought there were two different mutos but they were both the same, just being a female and male version which disappointed me a bit.<br/><br/>Godzilla has his fire breath, I fanboyed, and he killed one of the mutos with his tail which also made me fanboy.<br/><br/>Godzilla goes out being the cities savior."
"harsh-kabeer1","7","3","7","16 May 2014"," Stealing Guillermo Del Toro's words for Pacific RIm, Godzilla is a great, great poem to one of the biggest movie icon.
","If you have come looking for characters and development, there is not much to find here, unfortunately. It is kind of bummer when the movie does boast a very decent cast. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame does have his few moments initially, but later he is reduced to conspiracy mumbling scientist. His rather wooden son, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is a military boy who returns home only to find the world under a far greater threat. Elizabeth Olsen plays the loving and caring wife, but don't go looking for emotional epiphany there either. Ken Watanabe is mostly found in one or two positions, either he is spewing deeper philosophical ramifications of Godzilla's presence or he is just stunned with the proceedings. But then the actors are not to be blamed, because the story does not provide much of an area for the actors to make the characters their own and the clunky story telling leaves much to be desired from the humans. Gareth Edwards tries to give a logical coherence to the movie that takes itself seriously, but as monster movies always tend to be, Godzilla is filled with plot holes and logic debridement. The story deliberately uses the human characters to be the vehicles to tell the story of the heroic adventure of Godzilla through their eyes, and also as a scale to measure the enormity of the monsters. Gareth Edwards has worked meticulously to build up an atmosphere with great construct of light and shadow that varies with each of the set pieces. The set pieces are huge and Edwards have tried to bring phenomenal outrageous craziness to these locations so that when the monsters hit, one could shudder at the reality of it if it did ever happen. But that does not work much towards infusing us with terror, since the human emotional context is entirely missing. But it does manage to fill us with awe. When the monsters break out onto the screen or leave mayhem in their path, we find ourselves watching a lyrical celluloid of mayhem, destruction and monstrosity with the realisation of the colossal nature of the beasts and our minute existence. In the last epic battle as the giants fight in the shadow of smokes and darkness in the middle of a city, the fight takes on the form of gigantic proportions on which the fate of the humanity is precariously balanced. Godzilla is not much of a movie with enough emotional resonance, but it is a monster movie through and through. You may lament for mere twenty minutes of Godzilla's presence, but then you would be entirely missing the point of movie if you couldn't find monsters on the screen in their absence. It is one of the few beauties of Godzilla. For many the build up of Godzilla may be intolerable and the brief final battle too short, but if one can look at the amount of technical and visual wizardry and Edwards' vision has gone to create a monster movie that is about atmosphere, build up and visual spectacle, and to what wonderful poetry those are translated on the screen, you would be able to appreciate it."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","3","7","16 May 2014"," Brilliant at some moments and obnoxious at others
","This is one of my most honest reviews because this movie is something I've been waiting for since I was 3. <br/><br/>Godzilla is a movie that has brilliance at one moment and the mediocrity the next. This unevenness made me more mad than I have ever been in a theater. However, the movie is still really well made.<br/><br/>What Godzilla does is it shows the perspective of a ""Godzilla event"" from the eyes of the humans. Everything is to a much more personal degree and the movie will realistically only show as much of the battle as the main cast can see... this is also one of the movie's greatest weaknesses.<br/><br/>What this movie will do is it will intentionally ""tease"" the audience. Rule 1: Never tease the audience unless you have a really good reason. This movie will build-up the stage for a battle for 20 FREAKING MINUTES AND THEN NOT SHOW YOU THE BATTLE! I'm not even joking, there is an action sequence that got both Godzilla and Muto on an island and right as they are roaring... the movie cuts to some humans watching TV. That was a kick in the groin. The movie thinks it is funny to tease the audience but the whole reason we are seeing this movie is for monster vs. monster action. To TAKE AWAY the reason we are watching the movie (just for a joke) makes the movie significantly damaged.<br/><br/>What makes matters worse is that this is done more than once throughout the movie, and the material that it is cut to is significantly less interesting than the fight. I will say that the beginning half of the movie had some great acting and some really good build-up. It is no lie that this movie has ingenious moments of tension. The rising of Muto was one of the coolest things I have seen in awhile. Actually, the design of Muto is just great all around. The problem is that the second half of the movie is lacking that certain ""interesting"" character that the first half had. If the movie had focused around a different character then it would've been a much better film. Unfortunately, the character we get has very little to say or convey.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the movie does know how to do a monster battle right... and when it comes... it is epic. The final battle is hugely satisfying and maybe the director intentionally left out monster battles just to make it all the more satisfying. Regardless, it is great. Some complain that Godzilla looked too fat in this movie, but I thought he looked fine. They were looking for a realistic Hesei era Godzilla (which had huge legs) but his atomic breath is styled off of the Showa Era Godzilla. I can imagine some people getting mad and not realizing what Godzilla's breath looked like during the Showa series, but it is very similar to the original fire.<br/><br/>All in all, Godzilla is better than the 1998 movie in many ways. The movie could've achieved greatness if it had played its cards a little better and if it would've known which character was the most interesting. Go see it if you want to see an awesome finale."
"vilbergsson7","7","3","7","16 May 2014"," Less is more!
","Firstly, Gareth Edwards did a wonderful job on this movie and the characters are a perfect selection, but who I ""blame"" are the story writers. Seems like after a powerful start (aprox. from the beginning to the revisiting of the nuclear zone) they seemed to have simply run out of ideas and the rest of the movie was a cliché. They started to build it up excellently only to see it getting stuck at a low level. For me one monster (Godzilla obviously) would have made the cut. The scenes of the monster fighting where just too long and occasionally boring. The main reason why I give it 7 out of 10 is that after watching the trailer I thought that finally somebody makes a trailer which gives you enough information but doesn't spoil the story but on the other hand gets you super excited about the whole thing. Well, for me the parts of the trailer, which I though would probably be the ""crumbs"" in the movie, ended up being my favorite parts, which is not a good deal. I saw so much in this story, started to imagine cool scenes that could maybe happen in the movie in a similar form, but they just didn't come up with anything good in the second part. The ending: seriously, who does cheer for a monster that kills about 10 thousand people per footstep. I thought it was the worst ending for a movie of this kind. Maybe killing it would have been to simple, or they thought maybe it's not a good thing to put an end to the main character. Maybe they have a Godzilla II plan, but I wouldn't recommend it. That was enough for another 20 years or so. If not for the good beginning and great acting (mostly by Bryan Cranston) then my rating would be similar as the 1998 version, Okay maybe that's a little too harsh, but there was a lack of the scent of fear, you didn't feel the weight of the whole monsters attacking the world thing. All in all, It was like watching two or three movies mixed up. I felt disappointed. <br/><br/>A few things that I wanted to see more of: more Godzilla, more Bryan Cranston, more Godzilla vs men, more buildings getting destroyed by Godzilla.<br/><br/>What I wanted to see less of: The other monsters, the Dr. (who always came up with something new like as if he had only needed a bit time to think it through), the planning (let's blow them up, no let's rather follow Godzilla on the sea, okay, let's wait a bit until he starts too take down the bridge, there are civilians on the bridge don't shoot! okay now - shoot!)"
"petarmatic","7","3","7","16 May 2014"," It is all about Visual Effects!
","This film was all about Visual and Special Effects! Plot was too thin and it seemed to me that I saw all that before. I wish I could say something positive about the plot but I am sorry, I just can not. It was a little bit too much repetitive from the previous films of this type. I liked the scene when the jump from the airplane, that was a little bit unusual and it had some appeal to it.<br/><br/>Acting was something to be desired even for this type of film, no one really jumped out with acting skills. Fair but not fabulous.<br/><br/>All in all it is a very entertaining movie and if you like non stop action with a lot of visual effects this is a film for you. I recommend it. It will be not a waste of your time."
"pick-of-fate","7","3","7","15 May 2014"," Godzilla comes out on top with some minor hiccups! (Minor spoiler)
","First of all the beginning of this film was gripping, emotional and driven by one of the best actors today (Bryan Cranston), however if these moments weren't depicted within all of the trailers then it would of had a bigger impact on me, however I can still appreciate the emotional and gripping performance from Cranston.<br/><br/>Now was it a good idea to hand the leading role over to kick-ass star (Aron Paul Johnson)?? In some ways yes, he gave a solid performance, however I did miss Bryan after a while as he isn't in as much scenes then Aron. The one actor that I hated in this movie and was one of the reasons for bringing my rating down was Ken Watanabe but more on him in a minute.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film is amazing, they couldn't have done a better job with it and Godzilla's intro was just phenomenal. The flight scenes were intense and surprisingly they made you feel for Godzilla more then you would think. He acts as the anti-hero in this action packed blockbuster so you he has elements of a terrifying monster crushing everything in his path but also emotional moments that stood out best for me.<br/><br/>Some of the shots in this movie are just pitch perfect... At one point my jaw dropped... And this isn't because of the intense fight scenes or the scale of the creatures roar, there was a moment (and not to give too much away) when Aron Paul Johnson is standing in the street looking at Godzilla up close (it's silent) and Godzilla simply looks back at him, and then smoke and dust cover the creatures face. It was just perfect. (Trust me that doesn't give away anything)<br/><br/>The bad points of this movie involved the section of the film leading up to the third act. It switched from different places too quickly and everything was happening too fast that it just felt like a bit of a mess, not saying that these scenes were rubbish, but some seemed pointless, and the structure of this section of the film was flimsy. Which put me off and got me a little bored.<br/><br/>One final negative point is Ken Watanabe... At first I was excited to see him in this role however his acting during this film was appalling!! and it put me off every scene he was in. His acting was terribly awkward and it was a shame he had more screen time then Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>Overall the beginning of the film really grips you, the second act got a little too messy for my liking, but the third act was pure gold. If you are a big fan of Godzilla this movie goes back to the original films feel and if you are just a normal movie viewer, you should still watch this movie because it is emotional, intensely gripping and so so cool.<br/><br/>Overall rating of 8/10<br/><br/>Deducted 2 stars due to ken watanabes performance, lack if Bryan Cranston (minor issue) and the unstable structure of the second act.<br/><br/>Hope this helped!<br/><br/><ul><li>Shaun</li></ul>"

","Me and a few mates went to see this film thinking it would be the perfect end to a summer's day. We have never been so wrong in our lives. <br/><br/>This movie had, quite possibly, the worst plot line ever. The main fighting scenes occur between animated characters. The military had hardly any input (a little more would have made it a little more entertaining).<br/><br/>They USED AND ABUSED the star of Breaking Bad, knowing full well that his presence would attract people like us. Unfortunately, he is only in the film for like 20mins!!! Furthermore, he is the only one from the cast with the remotest bit of acting talent. The lead character waltz around with a constant still face. This film categorically destroyed a childhood classic. <br/><br/>This movie was so bad, that this is my first review ever written.

","I could've been kind to give this 2/10. My boyfriend wanted to watch this movie ever since the trailer, but never had the chance to catch it in the theater so we just saw it on DVD. He was very excited to see it, but he end up falling asleep again and again during the movie. I had hard time staying awake and attentive to it as well. It was tedious and every minute of it was tiring, like it was never-ending. I had never been so bored during a movie I had to find entertainment on my phone while it's on. <br/><br/>The first 15-25 minutes of the movie was the probably the best, but it also made the remainder 4/5 of the movie look like crap. Bryan Cranston did an amazing job on doing his part and increased the suspense for the movie. But too bad it didn't continue to elevate to climax after his death. Nothing from the other actors/actress stood out, everyone that was in the movie (besides Cranston) could've been there or NOT and it wouldn't make a difference. <br/><br/>Onto the MAIN guy, Godzilla, the most anticipated creature that only showed his back spike, tail, and shadows for 85% of his screen time. If you want to catch his face and some action, don't take your eyes off the screen for a second, you might miss it during that one second. The whole time I was waiting for some real action, but no, the max time of the actions were probably 5 minutes. And it was not ""wow"" at all. I could watch the Transformers for the 50th time and the reaction I have for Transformers would still be more excited than the reaction I have for Godzilla's.<br/><br/>Bottom line: <br/><br/>1. Very misleading trailer. It's definitely not even as close as being exciting as you'd think. <br/><br/>2. Super misleading movie title, it should be named ""Giant Beetle/Cockroachs"", since they have like 2X the screen time compared to Godzilla. <br/><br/>3. Plot is everywhere (unorganized), and many parts that doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>4.Actors/Actresses didn't make any difference (except Cranston)<br/><br/>5.Please, don't waste your time like we did.

I never write reviews, but this film angered me so much, I had to. Well it seems my review is too short, so I guess I'll complain for two more seconds. Godzilla spent all this time hunting down the Mutos, but apparently only to kill them, not eat them. Wonder what Godzilla eats? And both Godzilla and the Mutos displayed some human like intelligence. After the nest was destroyed, the female heard some glass breaking and noticed the nearby(?) soldier, and eventually went after that soldier later as if it recognized him. Pathetic. And Godzilla seemed to be concerned about all the meat sacks that were following him around and eventually shooting at him, but never got upset about it. What a great monster, a real sport.

The army boys are about to jump out of the plane and loading revolvers. Revolvers? Seriously? A basic principle in forces is to dump any unnecessary crap in an emergency situation. What are you doing loading your revolver man? The navy escorts Godzila for a long way along the sea knowing that it is not on its way to buy some bread, where they could have easily killed it with minimal collateral damage. But when it enters Vegas they shoot at it with thousands of people around. Hiks! I couldn't help it and Laughed and hooted in the hall for that joke. It is the only movie that I have seen in recent times where human's plans go totally wrong all the time. Only thing they manages to do is to send the last nuke away in a boat. (The boat is disabled by radiation. But that funky guy stars it in car robbery style. More Laughs!) In 1945 when US attacked Japan the people who lived in the sight range of the nuke didn't stand a chance. But in 21st century, with more advanced and larger bomb you can trigger it, let it float in a boat and have a nice view of the blast being in a chopper. Hick! Hick! Hikiz! Waste of Money. Expensive but an ideal movie to be shown to lunatics. they will enjoy it. but not for us."

","This movie is so unbearably bad. The only reason why I don't resent the producers for having misguided me into watching it in a theatre, is the fact that my friend and I laughed so much with the absurdity of it.<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes that it is easy to say this movie has no particular plot. Godzilla shows up after the first hour of the film to save humanity(!) from giant moth-like monsters who are the actual villains of the film. The plans humanity makes to fight this monster have no purpose and defy logical explanation. In general, the leaps this movie makes to move on with the story are too far fetched for anyone over the age of 7 years old to believe. And even then, the plot devices are the greatest clichés cinema has to offer. <br/><br/>Furthermore, at some point the movie decides to move the monsters to America for no apparent reason. It seems that Tokyo isn't enough to cause us distress over its destruction. We need to see Americans suffer and run for their lives. And of course American soldiers are the only ones capable of saving our innocent lives. Well that way of thinking did nothing for me. Although I did shed tears of laughter with the unconcerned wife of the main character, whose husband is in the middle of a nuclear event and after a phone call to some office she continues living her life without a care in the world, even though her husband had just returned from being in a war zone for 14 months. With so much love I think I might be moved by this film after all. Especially since all actors lack acting skills and have the inconceivable variety of one facial expression per actor.<br/><br/>Did I mention that Godzilla was actually a secondary character? Or that our protagonist shoots at a giant bug with a shotgun? So many fine points in this film. The only reason why someone should watch it is if they want to have a laugh or play a drinking game. Every time the script is wrong or cliché drink. You'll be wasted halfway through the film."
"Aaron1375","9","4","11","25 May 2014"," Now that is Godzilla!
","As a child, one of my first loves was the old Showa Godzilla films of the 60's and 70's. Along with those old Japanese shows featuring dudes who raised their arms to the heavens and became robots to fight creatures or one with a family of rocket people that fought giant monsters. I loved the Godzilla films where Godzilla fought off the bad monsters and though I liked the ones where Godzilla, himself, was the bad guy I always enjoyed him more as the hero. The Hesei era Godzilla films would come along and reestablish the big G as a bad guy; however, as this series went along once again Godzilla would be more of the monster you pulled for as Space Godzilla and Destroyah would have to be dealt with. Then Millenia Godzilla series would be a mixed bag having one where Godzilla was the ultimate evil in ""Godzilla, Mothra and King Gidorah: All Out Monster Attack"" and another where he is once again a good guy in ""Final Wars"". Though admittedly I did enjoy watching the evil version kick all three of those monsters butts; however, I did root for the humans to ultimately defeat Godzilla cause he was super evil. So I have to say I like Godzilla more as the hero and that is why I got super excited while others were a bit disappointed by the fact Godzilla was the good guy.<br/><br/>The story has a mishap at a nuclear plant leading to the strange birth of a creature that is a threat to all mankind. Another beast is tracking this creature though and its name is Godzilla! The humans devise a plan to kill both these creatures as well as a female version of the strange creature that feeds on radiation as they wish to get rid of all three in one bang. A scientist who knows of Godzilla, though, tries to tell them that Godzilla may be the key to getting rid of the other two as it wants to hunt these other beasts and take them down!<br/><br/>This Godzilla film did not really have all that big a budget, but they did rather well considering. I also understand why Godzilla was not in this film a whole lot, and it is because of the budget. This film is basically a test to see if Godzilla can succeed. However, all those complaining about the lack of Godzilla, I wonder if they watched all that many Godzilla films? A lot of the Japanese films feature a build up till the end where the fight takes place, so to me it is something very true to the Japanese films. Godzilla is territorial in the later Showa films, in Terror of Mecha Godzilla when Titanisaurus is ravaging the city, Godzilla is seen on the enemies' radar and they comment that Godzilla is coming to fight the other monster. It just felt like a Godzilla film, probably one of the Showa era, which is probably why it totally had me psyched! <br/><br/>So this film was way better than 1998 film which was not a Godzilla film. That one should have been titled something else and I would have said it was an okay monster film, but they just had to call it a Godzilla film which is why I hated it. They did it right here as this Godzilla not only was not killed by missiles, he ignored them! I do hope a sequel is made as I would love to see another Godzilla film done in this world. They do need to bring back Wantanabe's character as he can be like Miki was in the Hesei era. Now that they have established Godzilla once again and if this one is considered a success I am sure a bigger budget will be used in the next film meaning more Godzilla and perhaps another Toho monster? Bring on King Gidorah I say!"

The first remake/reboot is great (although they make their own story). FX is decent. Plot is great actually. Very tense and thrilling. This movie?? Yawn... yawn ..yawn.... It's just a ""visual FX"" and destruction-fetish movie with decent casts and nothing more. The pace is too slow. The tension is never going up. The monsters are not scary. The drama is not there. The roles & script are weak. Too many unnecessary things are put in the movie and stretch the duration to long for an uninteresting plot."
"CaptainxBumout","9","4","11","23 May 2014"," Not your typical blockbuster but a true Godzilla movie
","It's been 60 years since Godzilla first appeared on screen and since then, everyone knows his name. Now after over 30 movies and less than half of them being good, we can add another to the positive column.<br/><br/>Godzilla works for multiple reasons. The first being that director Gareth Edwards truly understood the character and knew how to capitalize his time on screen. I've seen a lot of people complaining about there not being enough Godzilla but it's become pretty clear that those people have never seen a Godzilla movie before except maybe the bad 1998 version. Godzilla has and always will be about people. Granted, most of the human stories in the movie aren't very good and this one is no exception. It's decent enough as the pure spectacle is enough to carry the film. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen don't have memorable characters. I'd say Elizabeth Olsen was especially wasted in her role and Aaron Taylor Johnson was just a bland solider. Bryan Cranston was really the only one with a more fleshed out character. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins were interesting but Watanabe had too many scenes where he just stared off for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff, everything else. The movie is beautifully shot. Most of the action is seen from the character's points of view which really brings together the scale of the whole film. Slight spoiler, there is another monster in this film that Godzilla has to fight. For the most part, you don't see that happen until the end and it's that sole reason that a lot of people are let down but what they don't understand is that if they showed them fighting halfway through the movie, the ending fight wouldn't feel as big as it did. The final fight is probably the greatest choreographed Godzilla fight ever on screen. You get the classic tail whip and homage's to past movies. The slow burn fire breath scene is an amazing revelation and I can only imagine a kid's first time reaction to it. The ending kill is also fantastic. You think one things going to happen, and then something else completely different happens and it becomes the best Godzilla kill ever.<br/><br/>The movie isn't as completely grim as the trailers would make you believe. There was a scene where a dog runs away from a tidal wave that reminded me of Independence Day and there's even a scene where Godzilla sighs. Plus you get an old school man in suit style CGI fight that works extremely well. People who don't really watch Godzilla movies probably don't even notice it which shows the adoration Gareth Edwards put into this movie. This wasn't just a simple cash in. This was a fan making a movie about something they loved growing up and knocking it out of the park. This movie is different from the constant ADD action blockbusters that we've grown accustomed to over the years and it's fantastic."
"jake-hagan","1","4","11","22 May 2014"," Just terrible.
","I was always apprehensive going to watch the newest version of Godzilla because I didn't really appreciate the 1998 film. Having said that the thought of Bryan Cranston being the main character within in the film (Well, as the adverts suggested) was enough for me to go and see it. I'm sat here now wishing I hadn't paid to see such an elongated, thin plotted, absolute waste of millions. The film started promising with suggestions of the beast that would eventually rip apart the entire world and looked to have an explanation as how a giant lizard could inhabit the earth. The film starts with Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and Sandra Brody (Juliette Bionche) going to work in their power plant, an 'earthquake' means that Sandra dies so prematurely that to be honest, I couldn't have cared less. The film was then single handed carried by Bryan Cranston until his again premature death and at that point the film died when Bryan did. Aaron Taylor-Johnson took over as the cliché macho lead man and was about as wooden as an oak tree. The film just became increasingly pointless and full of drawn out 'dramatic' moments that just don't go with a film that is essentially about a giant lizard. The writing became lazy and cringe like and Ford (Aaron) seemed to be a terminator the amount of blasts and falls he survives, which I could have been okay with if the film had just settled for what it was supposed to be, an action film not an action-adventure-drama-romantic- fantasy film. But by far the most ridiculous part of the film was the giant moth couple who kiss at one point and having Godzilla be the 'hero' of the film. At one point despite killing thousands of innocent people and destroying three cities Godzilla is announced 'Our saviour.' I honestly would not recommend this film to absolutely anyone! Everything about the film was just awful and I really don't know how I didn't walk out of the cinema."

","Godzilla was a lot better than I originally thought it would be. From the CGI, characters (human and monster) and surprisingly story. Sure there were some bad points like some of seemly wooden acting but the overall of movie more than made up for. And Godzilla was great. The filmmakers managed to capture a perfect image of him. Reminiscence of the earlier Japanese films. I didn't think this movie would be any better than the one that came before but the director had a vision of what and how to create a movie fans of Godzilla have been wanting to see. It basically made me forget about the other film 1996. My only complaint is not enough scene time, but when he was on scene. It was awesome. When comes out on DVD, it's going right in my collection."

"sudeeptranschanda","9","4","11","17 May 2014"," Not One Of The Best Kaiju Movies... But a Legendary One At That
","Im no stranger to the Gojira franchise. I've seen some, if not most, of the devastation Godzilla has caused in the history of cinema. And the '98 disaster did not miss my eyes either. Truthfully, last years Pacific Rim had my raised my expectations, to the point where I was hoping there'd be a boss fight every 20 minutes. That flame inside me was somehow snuffed when the movie turned out to be quite the opposite. The movie is like the canon fodder for its own climax. Despite the movie showing imminent clash of the monsters, there is nothing that intense up till the interval.<br/><br/>But the way it builds up the tensions, the way it presents the iconic kaiju and of course the carnage that ensues, that alone made me confident that the post-interval would be a complete blast. And till the end the movie is guaranteed to entertain even the hard-to-please fans. 'This Godzilla' indeed has a better future, I thought.<br/><br/>Sure, it annoyed every movie-goer to see the first boss-battle as a third-person through a news footage, but that gets compensated post interval. The only reason it gets a deduction is because it truly isn't the protagonist. In His own movie. But isn't that what cliffhanger movies and games have been doing for more than a decade? And further more, since Toho disowned Zilla'98, making this the first American Godzilla, isn't the first of every monster franchise presenting things in a slow and steady way. But thats not saying much, given the fact that Aaron Johnson gets a bigger piece of the pie. We get to see his character right from childhood from the beginning to where he's married with a 5yr old son. This is the part that annoys me in every monster movie (except Pacific Rim), the human guy, actually the supporting actor gets to be the protagonist while the Main guy/protag/antagonist gets demoted. <br/><br/>Despite all these nuances, you still get the visual treat as you witness the largest Gojira to date in all his glory. His war cry, his desperation, his cries of pain, of anger and of victory is completely out of the world, as are also complemented by his facial expression. Clearly it wins over us, gaining lost fans in the way and placing a mark through time. Im all good for sequels and congrats to the team behind its creation."
"randy_orton_fan","Null","4","11","16 May 2014"," Film That Had Potential, But Didn't Live Up To It
","I'm not going to lie, I didn't really have any high hopes going into this movie. I've never been a fan of monster movies, and after the 1998 film, I was definitely not a Godzilla fan. But I first saw the trailers for this and saw Bryan Cranston was in it. I figured, a film with him in it can't be that bad, can it?<br/><br/>I was wrong. The movie started out good. It had a mystery about it, and following Cranston's character as he tries to uncover the mystery had me enjoying the film.<br/><br/>Then (SPOILER ALERT HERE):<br/><br/>They killed Cranston's character fairly early in the film. Leaving us to follow Aaron Johnson's cookie-cutter ""Soldier whose wife worries about constantly"" character. I like Johnson in Kick-Ass, I thought he was a good actor. But he just seems to only be in this for the paycheck. Elizabeth Olsen isn't much better, and her character development goes as far as ""wife of main character, mother of main character's son"".<br/><br/>Now comes the part that really turned me against this movie.<br/><br/>Godzilla, the title character, is barely even in it. When he is in it, it's exciting, don't get me wrong. There is a lot of destruction and we actually get to see him fight other monsters like in some of the classic movies from Japan. But the way the trailers made it out, it made it seem like Godzilla was going to be this film spanning force of nature that would be causing mayhem most of the film. Instead, meh.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if anyone doesn't like my opinion, but I've seen far better movies than this.<br/><br/>The silver lining is, that this film is vastly superior to the 1998 crapfest starring Matthew Broderick. The effects were amazing, and Godzilla has never looked better. But good effects don't make a movie good.<br/><br/>I've got to give it a low score because the movie was just not the way it was hyped. It takes itself way too serious, and I just couldn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>Had Bryan Cranston's character been the character you follow the entire film, it would have been better. Instead of Robo-Johnson.<br/><br/>See it if you want, but you're not missing out on anything if you choose to see something else."

","Following the astronomical failure of the 1998 American Godzilla movie, there was a lot of uneasy feelings surrounding this film. It almost seemed like it was going to make the same mistakes of the 1998 film. It was another American version and Godzilla was CGI again. However this film is, thankfully, dramatically better. One of the biggest reasons for this movies success is in large part due to Gareth Edwards excellent direction. Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of the ""boots on the ground"" type of cinematography. Where the film is shot almost like a documentary. Most of the shots are only from angles that normal humans would be able to get.<br/><br/>Inside of buildings, up from the street, and on top of skyscrapers. Again, I usually am not a fan of this style but for this film is actually works very well. Since the major threats of the film are three gigantic monsters this technique helps to give you a sense of realism. It makes these huge creatures have a sense of presence and scale.<br/><br/>Being able to see how large these creatures are from a human angle really shows how monstrous they are. While Edwards hasn't shown that he can be a great director yet he has shown with the few films he's made that he understands how to give CG a sense of presence.<br/><br/>Filming them mainly at night or in large cities. My favorite part of the film though is it's sound design. Whether it's the thunderous crashes of the creatures footsteps or the intimidating roars they emit, each sound is unique and well designed. Being able to associate noises with the specific monster further helped them feel like they were actually there.<br/><br/>It was clear that the majority of the film makers time and effort was spent here because the story is pretty eh. It was difficult to get into things when our main character could remarkably go any where the monsters were. Sure he was in the military so a few times it made sense how he could be there.<br/><br/>The problem is the entirety of the story revolves around these creatures. It follows them around to each area they go to. They wreck some stuff and then go somewhere else and repeat. Usually this boring, under developed plot would aggravate me a lot more than it did here. <br/><br/>The main reason it didn't was because it never begs you to care about what was going on. It knows what it is and has fun with it. It gives a reason for it being in the place that it was and then showed you some awesome carnage. Because that's what you paid for right? To see these cool beasts throw down.<br/><br/>Many will argue that the creatures didn't have enough screen time but I thought they were used just right. Showing them to much would have hurt the immersion of the film and to little would have made this very boring. But they were used just enough to make them intimating every time you see them. ​ Obviously this isn't a perfect film. It's thin and sometimes a bit uneven but it's strengths far out weigh its weaknesses. It's fun, big, and bold. It creates a great atmosphere and doesn't beg for you get into the story. This makes it very easy to get sucked into the film and have a blast watching it."
"veeremptiness","7","2","4","7 April 2016"," Movie was Good
","Remember 'Jaws'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance – boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago – but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?<br/><br/>As it turns out, it's not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of 'Godzilla' is concerned - but that's probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards' part. The young director ('Monsters') has stated many times that 'Jaws' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in 'Godzilla' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg's masterpiece (they're both called Brody). Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach – and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets).<br/><br/>The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature – is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it's hard to stay invested in the human side of the story. After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it's hard to feel thrilled. Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don't feel too much attached.<br/><br/>Ultimately – despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale – 'Godzilla' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in 'Jaws', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago. Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did – you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We're gonna need a bigger boat!"""

","I must say, I was surprisingly entertained by Godzilla. Even though I don't usually love monster movies, this one kept me hooked even after a somewhat normal 20 minutes. From then on, I really got into it and ended up having a wonderful time. It comes to me as a surprise why so many people disliked it, but I guess to which his own.<br/><br/>While there are some subplots, the main focus of the film is on Aaron Taylor Johnson's character Ford Brody, as he will be brought up against all sorts of chaos stirred up by the monsters. As for the title character itself, he will act more like an anti-hero, serving as an assistance against the true baddies the MUTO's. I personally didn't hate the main story line, even though it wasn't the most interesting thing ever. It was at most okay, not terrible. Getting to the good stuff however, the movie lives up to its summer blockbuster status as it offers great action sequences that don't give you too much at once, but rather a visual treat of destruction.<br/><br/>Maybe it will become a guilty pleasure of mine, but for now I firmly state that this movie was ,quite frankly, awesome. Sure the story isn't the most engaging, yet for me it was a great background for what I wanted to see and that was the spectacular effects and fights.

In 1998, Hollywood tried to get in on the action under the helm of big, dumb blockbuster specialist Roland Emmerich, and while the result is routinely derided by one and all, it made a comfortable profit.<br/><br/>Now, they have tried again, with inexperienced indie director Gareth Edwards. He has enjoyed a remarkable career trajectory since his micro-budget film Monsters won praise from a variety of sources. Before the dust had settled from Godzilla's landing, it was announced that he had been given charge of the first of several new stand-alone Star Wars films which will sit alongside JJ Abrams' main trilogy.<br/><br/>The stars come from the indie world too. Aaron Taylor-Johnson broke through with British drama Nowhere Boy (which I thoroughly recommend), and continued the trend by starring as the unlikely hero Kick-Ass. Elizabeth Olsen's early success was trailer park drama Martha Marcy May Marlene. More recently, both have cemented their status as rising stars by appearing as super-powered brother and sister Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>There is something a bit... cynical, though, about the placement of their characters in Godzilla. ATJ is Ford Brody, a former soldier and war veteran, while Olsen is his wife Elle, a nurse. Both are, I gather, professions that are practically shortcuts to instant sympathy in large parts of the American audience. This is edging on being a problem for me, because in Britain at least, military people have no such rosy glow about them, and especially since what are widely regarded as massively misjudged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyway, to top it all off, they also have photogenic child Sam (Carson Bolde).<br/><br/>I don't know why it bothered me. It's certainly no more egregious than any number of other blockbusters. It doesn't feel any more blatant, either in the moment or looking back. It isn't even that big a problem: throughout most of the film, I was more amused than offended. ""Of course they are,"" I found myself thinking. ""It's almost as if they don't trust a skyscraper-sized lizard monster to cement audience sympathy.""<br/><br/>Godzilla has always been as much a character in his movies as a plot device, though. He has personality, motivations, even emotions of a sort. Taken over the series as a whole, he has friends and allies too.<br/><br/>This makes the character design extremely important, and Edwards and his team did a good job in this aspect. Yes, he is a bit wider around the waist than traditional portrayals, but calling him 'fat' is really a cheap shot, and not that important to the film either. And he looks fantastic. All the special effects work is excellent, in fact. Really top notch. It's not quite up there with Avatar, Gravity or Interstellar, but not far off, and putting such outlandish monsters firmly into an everyday context while still carrying the audience is quite a feat to pull off.<br/><br/>The themes are the thing though. The best Godzilla films I have seen are either ridiculously daft, or deeply allegorical, and not that subtle about it either. This Godzilla film's themes are understated, and slightly troubling: it seems to say that nature can handle itself, and protect us as we heedlessly harm the planet. I wanted metaphors a lot more blatant than this, and preferably better thought out.<br/><br/>By sacrificing the message, they move closer to the silly, spectacular model of Gojira films, but for my money, don't get close enough. It's a halfway house, and not successful enough at blending those two modes to raise it to the next level."

","Compared to the 2000 version this is epically superior, the acting is good and the size and scope of how really large Gorija or Godzilla is kept in perspective at all time; great storyline with all questions answered and very convincing special effects.<br/><br/>You find yourself actually cheering for Godzilla through most of the movie which I think is key in that you draw a connection, I can't think of a way they could have modernized or improved the concept any better than they did; in my eyes it was flawless and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>My only plight with the film was the military insistence that the only way to destroy the monsters was to use nuclear radiation which is what in fact created them to begin with, is our US military really represented to be that stupid even in film?"

","Really quite exciting, Godzilla is interestingly emotional and political in its approach to the generic monster movie genre. The once fresh-faced Aaron Taylor-Johnson is back and hardened to the ways of the world as he attempts to avoid the clutches of a terrifying beast that begins to rampage across the city as the creature attempts to breed. Humanity's last hope rests on Godzilla, who seems to do more damage than good, but nevertheless saves the day...more or less. What I didn't like about the film was that they decided to include the increasingly boring plot of a man attempting to reunite with his family through some kind of pandemic, similar to World War Z."

","At last, we have ourselves a terrifying monster movie that delves deep with a rich human story. After the mediocre 1998 Godzilla theatrical film, I never thought Godzilla would be brought justice on the big screen. But in 2014, this film came out and I am proud to say it is much better than the last Godzilla movie. The story is deeper, and there is more creature action to be had. I liked the design of Godzilla, even if it looks like he was injected with hyper steroids. I also thought the sound and Alexandre Desplat's score were also highlights of the film. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards's film is about this discovery which awakens these two carnivorous predators named ""MUTOS,"" which in turns waken an ancient dinosaur named Godzilla. With millions of lives at stake, Godzilla must hunt down these MUTOS, as long as the United States Army does not get in his way. <br/><br/>The film does boast an impressive cast. Aaron-Taylor Johnson does a good job in shedding his ""Kick-Ass"" mask to play a responsible Marin, Ford up near the front lines fighting these monsters. Bryan Cranston does a great job as Ford's father, but sadly his role is limited. Ken Watanabe is a mixed bag. He is a great actor, but it seems his skills were not as sharp in this film. Also, David Strathairn made for an interesting army colonel, even if his character was clichéd. <br/><br/>Overall, this Godzilla remake is much better than Roland Emmerich's version. This is truly a terrifying monster story that has the added bonus of a human story with is rich and engrossing. It could have been a straightforward disaster film, but luckily the film uses its story to add emotional depth. I had doubts when this movie was released, but those doubts have since vanished. Also worth noting is Godzilla is the main star of the show for a variety of reasons. <br/><br/>My Grade: A"

","Gosh was it as far back as 1998 when an over-hyped Godzilla arrived and underwhelmed everyone in its wake. Sixteen years later and another attempt has been made to relaunch this monster franchise.<br/><br/>Early scenes start promisingly enough with Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston in a bad wig. But Binoche's role is just a few minutes and Cranston while passionate also has limited screen time. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are wasted with almost non characters.<br/><br/>Worse, Godzilla is in effect a cameo character in his own movie. It literally is a walk on part. If there is some monster mayhem action it takes place in the dark. Never mind 3D glasses we should had got night vision goggles.<br/><br/>The plot is about a pair of parasitic giant insects called Muto's who are causing havoc. At the same time Godzilla is also on the rampage and it seems he is set on encountering the insects. On a human level Cranston's son is trying to make his way back to his wife and kid in San Francisco, after finding out the truth about what happened to his family home in Japan 15 years earlier.<br/><br/>The film starts off interestingly enough but gets lost in bland, clichéd characters and plotting. The script never rises above average. Even some of the action scenes such as the destruction of Las Vegas and San Francisco look undercooked. Yet the film does enough to keep you entertained so its not that mediocre."

","Godzilla fans like myself aren't here to watch Masterpiece Theater or a soap opera, but to watch the monsters battle it out. So why did Godzilla have such a small part in this movie? It took so long for the beasts to fight it out. Meanwhile, way too much time is devoted to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's family life. It wasn't acted or scripted badly, but it contributed little to the movie except for length. The film has an openly anti-nuclear power message, which is fine, but that was stated too many times. The result of a nuclear power accident is that it causes the creation of two monsters, which resemble locusts, and if they mate, it'll endanger the human race. As a result, Godzilla awakens and arises from the ocean to protect the earth. The special effects and computer generated imagery are excellent, the best ever in a Godzilla movie, and when the battle finally comes, it's well staged. Problem is there isn't nearly enough of it. The closing scene is quite good, but I still felt cheated."

The last go round we saw Ferris Bueller running through a basketball stadium being chased by tiny Godzillas, so the bar has been set nice and low. The 2014 version, directed by Gareth Edwards, has the giant reptile taking a far more traditional shape and role which should thrill old school fans. The CGI is exceptional and the fights are classic old school knock down kaiju style monster battles. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers didn't think that would be good enough to sell this iteration of the movie. Instead, we're subjected to useless, crammed in melodrama from Brian Cranston, Elizabeth Olson and Aaron Taylor-Johnson of Kick-Ass fame who in this movie should be named ""Lt. Coincidence"" and Ken Wantanabe who takes on the role of trying to futilely explain the ridiculous premise of giant monsters fighting each other to modern audiences which just becomes embarrassing after a while. All in all, Godzilla is a good movie but it gets its priorities mixed up on what it should focus on which just makes it AT BEST an OK movie. Godzilla gets a 2.5...out of 5."

","Flicking the memory of Roland Emmerich's disastrous 1998 Godzilla movie away with it's mighty finger, Gareth Edwards' 2014 re-imagining is an altogether mightier and maturer beast. The biggest question stemming from message boards and critic reviews alike, is whether the colossal lizard is seen, or even glimpsed, enough. Anyone who saw 2013's incredibly dull monster/machine pile-up Pacific Rim will surely be aware that more is not necessarily better, and CGI is soulless without a heart. So my answer to that question would be a yes, as although Edwards teases us perhaps one time too many, when the beast finally roars, it's spine-tingling.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Max Borenstein, based on a story by Dave Callaham, opts not to have the King of the Monsters the result of nuclear testing, but one of many ancient creatures laying low, feeding on the energy from the Earth's core. In 1999, scientists Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) discover the skeleton of a giant creature in a collapsed mine, and two pods. One pod has broken open and left a trail leading into the sea, and the other remains dormant. In Japan, unusual seismic activity causes a nuclear power plant to leak radioactive steam, killing the wife of plant supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston). Fifteen years later, Joe's son, bomb disposal expert Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), returns to Japan to find his father still obsessing over the unexplained events that led to his wife's death.<br/><br/>This sounds like a lot of plot for a movie primarily about giant, rampaging creatures. The director previously made Monsters (2010), a low-budget, very human drama about a world facing an alien invasion, only the focus was on the romantic relationship between it's two leads. Edwards clearly isn't interested in simply blowing s**t up for our amusement, he wants us to care for the people dodging the flying cars and falling skyscrapers. It's an admirable approach, and is careful not to serve up stock chin-stroking villains or supporting characters you are waiting for to croak, but does make the mistake of offering one- dimensional archetypes as our protagonists. We have our square-jawed lead, our brilliant but possibly mad scientist, and even an expository ethnic character to make sure we're keeping up with the plot.<br/><br/>There's also the problem of Taylor-Johnson, who although is a perfectly likable actor, does not have leading-man chops. This combined with his thinly-written character makes it incredibly difficult to get caught up in his long journey back to his loving wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and child (Carson Bolde). But while the film may often move at a snail's pace, it is never boring. Though the titular giant takes his time before popping his head up out of the water, there's two other bat-like creatures causing havoc, usually seen from the ground-up or on news reports, heightening the tension by creating a sense of realism. It's a very modern-day Gojira, developing it's own mythology yet appeasing fans of the beast's many incarnations, and no doubt frustrating those wanting to see an epic CGI smack-down.

They wanted to add a new twist to the story so added two new monsters and made Godzilla a savior. Thankfully they dint propose to start a cult for worshiping it. <br/><br/>Its actually quite funny to watch the Naval carriers cruising alongside the monster and to note that neither the monster gives a heed to them nor navy is slightly worried about the chance of the monster sinking them to the bottom of the ocean. The movie is riddled with such scenes. I sat to watch this movie, actually without doing much research blindly hoping that it would be good and that turned out to be a mistake. Actually some of the initial build up's were good but the movie failed utterly."
"Vivekmaru45","6","2","4","28 August 2014"," In all honesty, the 1998 film was better.
","The 1998 film had a better director, writer, and special effects technician. I am taking about Ronald Emmerich, Dean Devlin and Patrick Tatopolous. This team has worked on hits like Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day. This film had seasoned actors Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno who could carry any film by themselves.<br/><br/>The 2014 film is directed by Gareth Edwards who is not seasoned enough to handle such a big project. The writer Dave Callaham writes a dull story and thus the screenplay written by Max Borenstein is ineffective. Bryan Cranston(of Breaking Bad TV series fame) is the only good actor in the film. But he has a short role in the film.<br/><br/>The film does not continue from the 1997 film, but is a standalone film.<br/><br/>The plot hinges around Project Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate a colossal skeleton in a collapsed mine in the Philippines. They find two egg-shaped pods; one dormant, one broken open. The hatched creature burrows under Janjira Nuclear Power Plant and causes a seismic effect as it feeds on the reactor's radiation. Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), the plant's supervisor, sends his wife Sandra and a team of technicians into the reactor. While the team is inside, the reactor is breached, releasing radioactive steam. Sandra and her team are unable to escape and the plant collapses into ruin.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford is a US Navy explosive ordinance disposal officer, living in San Francisco with his wife Elle and son Sam. After Joe is detained for trespassing in the Janjira quarantine zone, Ford returns to Japan. Convinced of a cover-up of the cause of the disaster, Joe convinces Ford to help him retrieve vital data at their old home.<br/><br/>Watch film to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>The core of this film hinges on the C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) special effects and no attention is given to the unbelievably ridiculous plot, which you have to see to believe. If the trio of Emmerich, Devlin and Tatopoulos had begin given this project, then the result would have been much better.<br/><br/>Verdict: Just watch once and forget about it. This film will be forgotten in years to come among the many trash films produced by the United States film industry.<br/><br/>You may like: Gozilla 1954, Godzilla King Of The Monsters! 1956, Godzilla 1985."

","Good effects, bad acting, bad script, and oh the plot. I'm going to assumed you've watched the film and then go through some of the questions that I had.<br/><br/>So we never see the nuke get disarmed, and I'm assuming it went off, although they don't show this, which in itself is weird. How can what looks like a fairly slow boat have taken what we are told is an extremely powerful nuke far enough out to sea for San Francisco not to be totally fried, especially in the half an hour left on the clock? Even if it escaped the direct blast (which it wouldn't) the radiation would make it uninhabitable. And then how could the helicopter that picks up Brody have made it out of the blast zone in 5 minutes?<br/><br/>Further questions - why would you use planes against creatures that knock out planes? Why not bomb from 10,000 feet? Why would you put troops on a bridge where they are totally vulnerable? Why would you not use thermobaric bombs rather than nukes, and use them straight away, over the sea or desert, rather than waiting for everyone to converge in a residential area. Why give troops useless light arms. Why use a train to carry a bomb not a plane. Why put a nuke only 20 miles from a city, and then let it out of your control. How is there enough time to brief a new mission, fly a plane up there, drop troops, find a bomb and carry it to a boat, then drive that boat out to sea, in an hour and a half. Why set that time at all - why not use an unarmed one as bait, and drop another when the monsters go for it. If Godzilla is supposed to restore 'the natural order' when do we mean? Don't humans upset it? Why does Godzilla care? Are there no nuclear plants in Nevada - why would a MUTO travel to San Francisco, especially from a nuclear waste storage facility - surely they could meet there? Why would you put something you know feeds on radiation in that facility? Why not kill that one?<br/><br/>I get that I'm supposed to just switch off my brain and enjoy my popcorn, but seriously, it isn't that hard to write a story that makes a little bit of sense."

"toqtaqiya2","6","2","4","13 July 2014"," Gareth Edwards fails to do justice to the monster's legacy.
","If you've seen the trailer for this Godzilla film you probably thought that it would be a more faithful yet serious take on Japan's most famous monster. In the trailer Godzilla looked like a real threat. It seemed frightening the way it was portrayed. In the film though this isn't the case. We're yet again in that summer movie territory where the trailer was more inspired than the film itself. Does The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) come to mind? I think that the big reason why many people were disappointed with this Godzilla film is its lack of originality. If you pause and look at what's happening you'll see that it's actually very similar to the 1998 Godzilla film directed by Roland Emmerich. Godzilla is portrayed as a monster with some intelligence. It becomes a sympathetic creature. The American military and navy get involved, something that we've seen many times in Hollywood films recently. And, to top it all off, there's more focus on the human characters than on Godzilla. In fact, much time passes before the Big G even makes an appearance. So, just as in the 1998 film, we're forced to watch a typical human drama before anything exciting happens. But at least the 1998 film was entertaining. And it was a film about Godzilla. This 2014 film is lacking both Godzilla and entertainment. It's a summer movie, so I expected to be entertained. Instead I was left wondering what happened when the film ended. It wasn't just me. Other people in the theater were criticizing it right after it ended. Director Gareth Edwards really didn't have enough experience to make a big budget summer movie. The monster fights lack excitement, the acting is wooden, and the clichéd script lacks intelligence. I don't think that Edwards is a bad filmmaker. I think that he's an inexperienced filmmaker. His 2010 low-budget feature Monsters is a technical triumph that showed some promise. Max Borenstein's lazy script and studio interference are the two things that really ruined this film in my opinion. In a monster movie one would at least expect some exciting action but this film fails even at that. In addition, it's obvious that Edwards took the Jaws (1975) approach of obscuring the creature for much of the film's running time. Jaws, however, features interesting human characters and terrific performances. It keeps on movin' when the big shark isn't around. The human characters and performances in Edwards' Godzilla are flat, resulting in a truly dull middle section. Only Bryan Cranston, playing Joe Brody, stands out. Cranston is definitely one of the best Hollywood actors working now. His performance alone made this film bearable at the beginning, but even then the story's shortcomings were already noticeable. I have to admit that I had doubts about this film. I usually read reviews on a certain website before I go to the cinema. This time I made the mistake of reading the early positive reviews on IMDb, so I didn't wait for the review on that favorite website of mine. As it turned out, that website was right yet again and this Godzilla film made for an unpleasant night at the cinema. Some Godzilla fans might like what Edwards did, but casual moviegoers should definitely not buy a ticket. Remember, as was the case with the 1998 film, there's no hiding that this is a Western production. It has none of the quirks and cultural aspects of the Japanese films."
"Rob_Taylor","6","2","4","13 July 2014"," Is that it? What was the fuss about?
","I mean, it is like they followed some screenplay writer's Bible when they made this.<br/><br/>The plot is horribly simple and boring. The characters are so one-dimensional that I kept expecting them to vanish when they turned sideways and the action? Let's just say it plods along and leave it at that.<br/><br/>The CGI is good, of course, as you'd expect and the scenes of destruction are well done. But since a considerable portion of the movies budget went on them, you'd expect them to be good.<br/><br/>There was also, with this movie, a new pet-hate of mine (to join 3D, found footage movies, laughable physics and so on) in the form of needless explanation.<br/><br/>See, writers fall into two camps, for the most part. Those, like Damon Lindeloff (who gave us Lost, the red matter from Star Trek and the heinous rewriting of the Prometheus script) who explain nothing. Quite often that is because they can't explain it any other way other than to wave their hands and go ""Whoooo! Magic!"".<br/><br/>Then there are those who explain too much. You know what I mean here. George Lucas and his sodding Midichlorians! That never needed explaining George! Well, in Godzilla, we have an example of the last type. Unnecessary explanation.<br/><br/>Hands up who went to watch this movie expecting to find out where Godzilla came from? What? No one? Okay then. So none of us.<br/><br/>Yet here, we are treated to Godzilla and co essentially being explained away as ""Super dinosaurs"" from the dim past. Not only that, but then poor old Ken Watanabe has to repeatedly spout some Gaia nonsense about Godzilla being the one to ""restore balance"". Balance of what, exactly? Nature? These things are about as natural as Cthulhu, for God's sake! And no amount of ""But they're just big dinosaurs!"" will change that.<br/><br/>What is worse, is that Ken then goes on to describe Godzilla as an apex predator. What is it, Ken? Predator or ""one destined to bring balance""? And predator of what, exactly? We learn that all of these monsters feed on radioactivity. What kind of predatory instinct is required to sneak up on a chunk of uranium? As I said, unnecessary explanation that only confuses and confounds the viewer. Much like the force, we don't need Godzilla explained. Just let him fight other monsters and be done with it.<br/><br/>You don't need to explain Godzilla. We know he's on our side. Jibber-jabber about maintaining the balance is just laughable. What balance? He kills any other monster! That's not balance. That's just Godzilla being a shitbag to other monsters!<br/><br/>There is also a real lack of tension at any point in the film. You'll be mentally ticking off the plot points well before they happen and expecting every scene well before it arrives. In addition to this, there is a really annoying tendency to cut away from the monster fighting action at literally every opportunity in order to focus on the ""human drama"".<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a leading man doesn't do very well here. I'd like to blame the director, or writer, but Bryan Cranston manages to shine with his limited screen time and even Gaia-spouting Watanabe manages to be convincing about his gibber. ATJ, on the other hand, has about as much on-screen charisma as a lobotomy victim and as much personality as a paper picnic plate. Awful casting choice!<br/><br/>He's not the only casting dud, however. Elisabeth Olsen is given little to do as the wife who can't think for herself and manages to ""cry"" many times without producing a single tear. Likewise her son, played by Carson Bolde, was clearly told to look sad all the time. This, unfortunately, makes him look like internet meme ""Grumpy Cat"" for most of the scenes he is in.<br/><br/>As for the ending, well, it is a bit anti-climactic, with Godzilla (whom we all feared was dead, right?!) getting up and shambling off into the ocean and swimming away. Oddly enough the ending does fit the movie rather well, because it gives it a kind of ""Oh, Is that it? Best get up and go home then."" feel which sums up my feeling as the credits began to roll.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Not a bad attempt at recapturing the old Godzilla feel. Hampered by a poor script, poor characters and lots of pointless explanatory drivel. No real tension and a somewhat dull ending which sums up the movie in a nutshell. Worth it if there isn't anything better to watch."

","I didn't like my original review for Gareth Edwards' Godzilla, it is too much of a rant for my tastes, so I took the time to watch the film again. It really has been 2014's most divisive film yet and I wanted to be sure of my original opinion (You can't say I'm not fair!) But, despite a bit more forgiveness this time, I still find it to be a poorly executed film.<br/><br/>Doctor Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) has been following an ancient parasitic organism and tracked it down to a nuclear plant explosion in Japan. He finds one of the physicists there to have information he needs on the creature (known as a MUTO) but as the creature hatches and causes global destruction, Serizawa believes the military is not enough... and that an equally ancient creature is their only hope...<br/><br/>Now I'd like to stress, first and foremost this is not a bad film, it is simply very easy and very necessary to view the many problems it has. I like the film's audacity: in a time were big monster/robot movies are light or popcorn munching flicks (Transformers, Pacific Rim etc) this Godzilla attempts to merge what is a very rich legacy of films. On the one hand, we have the original 1954 film, for its time it is an edgy, morose and compelling blockbuster, but on the other hand we have the ridiculous and often laughed at monster battle movies that Toho Studios are famous for. Here, Gareth Edwards appears to be wanting both. An atmospheric, realistic (and almost philosophical) monster battle movie. We don't just get Godzilla, we have other monsters for him to fight, as well as human interests to follow! That is a big ask, for a film just two hours long, and I do respect the attempt.<br/><br/>The film looks great; there are some proper moments that are very cool and give a great sense of awe and enormity (Godzilla is staggeringly huge in this rendition) the marine ""halo jump"" scene is an intense sequence. I like the monsters as well, both traditional and new. The music too, upon the second viewing, is great! Going from low, trembling fear to bombastic chaos in a heartbeat. Ken Watanabe is also good in the film, giving a sense of origin to this otherwise all-American story.<br/><br/>But... (and it is a big, Godzilla-sized but) the storytelling, premise, motivations and character arcs are absolute garbage. I honestly have trouble understanding people saying this has better character motivation and emotion than say the aforementioned Pacific Rim or Transformers. This film is choked with some of the most unnecessary clichés of any typical blockbuster. ""Oh no, mass destruction of a major city, BUT WILL THE DOG SURVIVE!?"" There are some terrible oversights in logic also, making the military depicted appear completely incapable of rational thought, while the characters themselves work off an asinine script (something Gareth Edwards ""claim to fame"" Monsters also suffered from, a terrible script) All of this makes the human subplot, or should I say main plot, appear confused and redundant. Ugh, to stop a rant from developing again I will move on.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad features heavily in the film's trailers, yet his part has almost zero bearing on the film's story. Don't believe me? Watch it again. You could cut him out from the story completely. He should have been the focus of the film; he gave the most impassioned performance, but no, we follow instead his son, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Ford, a cardboard soldier who is forever under the feet of these monsters regardless of which country he's in. I know Aaron Taylor can act, I liked Kick-Ass, but here both the script (and mostly likely the director) gave him nothing to work with. A cynic could say, and I do, that Bryan Cranston's involvement was merely to boost ticket sales.<br/><br/>It is a difficult film to like; I can see a lot of it working (a sequel as a lot of potential for improvement) but it becomes so frustrating over time and two hours starts to stretch on for eternity. The monster fights climax wonderfully, but with literally one hundred minutes of build up, either of teeth-grindingly tedious character fluff, or continuously teasing grand battles with merciless edits and cut-aways (dare I say this is as bad as Cloverfield) the entire experience becomes a frustrating endurance.<br/><br/>I don't see why we needed a first act that is nearly pointless. Cranston's character could have been cut and replaced with more of Ken Watanabe's character giving Godzilla (you know, the titular character!) an actual backstory. We have an audience who believes the Roland Emmerich 1998 Godzilla is ""the original""! That is blasphemous; Japan and Toho actively distance themselves from that film. This was the opportunity to tell western audiences about Godzilla... and the film fails to do that."
"mark-vajd","5","2","4","11 July 2014"," Average when it should be great
","Walking into the movie theater, I was really hoping Godzilla was not going to disappoint. The trailers promised many action-packed scenes and with Bryan Cranston manning the helm, what could go wrong? Well apparently quite a lot. The director decided, very bravely might I add, to show us the human aspect of the natural disaster caused by massive animals fighting for their place under the sun. Did it work in his favor? No, it did not. Instead of drawing up some compelling characters, he decided that the plot of movie is to be propelled forward by the anticipation of the final fight. Everything that happens until the last 20 minutes simply serves as a prequel to the action that ensues. Instead of a well-acted and interesting film, the audience was treated to one hour and a half of delaying any kind of combat. The director was basically teasing the viewer, showing only glimpses of Godzilla and the other couple of creatures that were destroying the earth. Fantastic actors like Cranston, Watanabe and Strathairn were criminally underused; however, when they appeared on screen, they brought some much needed refreshment from the emotionless acting of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and one half of the Olson twins. The film's emotional peek is reached in the first 15 minutes and is of course delivered by Walter White himself. Other than that the film lacks any character development, which is normal for a summer extravaganza of special effects like Pacific Rim; however, when you try to do a monster movie from the human perspective, some layers to the performance are surely needed. The dialog is not worth mentioning. There is not a single line of this movie that I can quote. It lacks depth and comes across as superficial blabbering. The camera-work is fantastic. The use of angle shots that portray the humongous creatures from a human's perspective is breathtaking and really serves to bring out the awesomeness of the visual effects. When the last 20 minutes enfold, you are treated to one of the best fights in movie history. The effects and the camera-work come together for a jaw-dropping finale that you come to expect from a movie of this caliber. However it is not the final 20 minutes that make this movie forgettable, it is the hour and a half of stillness and boredom that precede it. In the end, I am not disappointed by the movie. It features one great emotional scene and one exceptional fight scene. If only the rest of the movie was up to par.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 / 10"
"addietomic","7","2","4","6 July 2014"," It's Gojira!
","In 1997, Roland Emmerich decided, after the colossal success of his ""Independence Day"" of 1996, to repeat the same procedure in spirit and wreck the world with an over the top sci-fi menace, probably hoping for a reprise of the same box office gross. He remade Toho's king of monsters for the US market, ""Godzilla"". Unfortunately, what resulted in the endeavor was a so much sillier and clumsier movie than his former ""War of the Worlds"" spin off. The audiences quickly recognized it as such and pretty much stayed away. The flick about a mutated sea-monster coming to Manhattan to lay its eggs/wreak havoc left a bad taste for everybody due to its goofy actors and completely implausible scenes, even for a brainless popcorn blockbuster. The movie tanked at the grosses, was tarnished by bad reviews and soon forever ended the Dean Devlin-Roland Emmerich writing-producing collaboration. It took many years on for any studio deciding to make a remake on the same plot line. Then, in 2013 a finally decent one emerged and got a green light. Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" of 2014 is an immensely more entertaining and more serious project than the former one. The digital effect sequences are a million times more on the ground, the actors and their screenplay relationships too, which is the winning combo. The spectators loved this version of the prehistoric reptile time around and gave it roughly 200 million on domestic sales alone, which is a fertile ground for the works on a sequel. And it is on it's way too, slowly from the depths, but sure in quality, just like Gojira."
"DmitriySharov","8","2","4","3 July 2014"," Nice movie!
","I went to see this movie like a week ago. I can say that before I was thinking that its gonna be a bad remake, but once I saw actors list and short story which they've used in this film I decided to go and see it. Honestly, I liked it! It's very good remake and nice story which could have part 2 I think. Actors were plying very well and you not gonna be bored and be like ""Oh I've seen it before"". Because you didn't see it before for sure. What can say? - It's a great action movie where you going from Japan to Hawaii, from Hawaii to California and it's all together, you not loosing the main idea, you always know whats going on and why. And it's great. If you have time - go and see it, you won't be bored for sure."
"schaefer95","Null","2","4","3 June 2014"," Overall great movie, but it will leave you with mixed emotions
","Spoiler free: I went in to this movie with high hopes of a visually fantastic movie, with great fights and a strong performance by one of my favorite actors: Bryan Cranston. With this expectation I will say that I left the theater with mixed emotions.<br/><br/>On the upside, the movie is visually stunning, the animations and destruction looks amazing and really shows Godzilla in his pride. Bryan Cranston's performance is breathtaking and makes the movie entertaining in the parts where Godzilla is not present. And that final? F*cking awesome! On the downside, there are not as many fights as I had hoped and Bryan Cranston was not that much in the movie as everyone expected(They really promoted this movie as if he was the lead character). So if you were expecting Heisenberg Vs Godzilla you will not be pleased by this film. The lack of action in a action movie makes the 2 hour runtime feel a bit dragged out(all leading up to the end, which makes it totally worth the wait), especially when Aaron-Taylor Johnsons character isn't that interesting.<br/><br/>Overall I will say this movie is worth watching, even if you aren't the biggest Godzilla fan. But know that this is a movie where the story centers more on the humans and how they react to a threat of this kind and less about the ""Pacific Rim like"" action jizz fest.<br/><br/>7/10"
"cultfilmfan","8","2","4","30 May 2014"," Godzilla
","For me, usually the summer time is a fairly weak time of movies, so during the summer I review few movies and just do not get out to the theatre all that much because of lack of selection. As my usual readers know, I am not one for the usual summer fare that comes out each year. Superhero films, sequels, prequels, big budget action films with a lot of special effects. None of that is in my range of taste whatsoever. I prefer the fall and winter seasons, because then you have all the award worthy films trying to win Oscars coming out and sure not all of them are always great, but it is a much better selection and they are better films quality wise than what we are subjected to during the summer time. That being said, I was not sure whether or not I would like this new version of Godzilla. It was released during the summer time, had the special effects, 3D glasses and big budget and all the things I usually avoid from a summer movie release. The last time I saw the character Godzilla, on the big screen was Roland Emmerich's 1998 version, which I saw when it came out and I thought it was absolutely terrible and for obvious reasons associated with that, I have never seen it since. A few years ago, The Criterion Collection issued a DVD and Blu Ray release of both the original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla, directed by Ishiro Honda and in the same package also included the 1956 American version directed by Ishiro Honda and Terry O. Morse and starring Raymond Burr. I ended up getting that DVD release and I enjoyed both the Japanese and American versions of the film (while I still did like the Japanese version better). With this new version of Godzilla, I have to say that overall I quite liked it. It was better than I thought it would be, not a masterpiece, but for a film of this kind, quite good and it exceeded my expectations for it. I have read online that a lot of viewers were disappointed with this new version, but for the reasons they did not like it, it seemed like those were a lot of the reasons I did like it. The film while it does have scenes of monsters, destruction and mayhem, did not focus exclusively on this and actually built the story up a fair bit before we are actually even introduced to Godzilla. I liked how it showed how these events occurred and sort of setting the tone and mood for what would come later in the film as well as giving a back story both to the human characters in the film as well as the monsters as well. So for that reason alone, I think a lot of people who just wanted non stop action for their two hours were disappointed because the film actually had a lot more to offer than that, by way of a fairly well developed screenplay and characters. I am not usually a fan of 3D, or the glasses, but I did not find that this version used it in an overwhelming, or self indulgent way as to take away from the story. The 3D really did not play all that big a role in this film and focused more on story and characters instead of the monsters themselves, or the explosions and crumbling buildings and I thought that was the right way to go. The film had a good pace and captured my interest from the beginning and continued to hold it to the end. Also while some of the Godzilla sequels over the years (we might even include the 1998 version in here as well) got very campy and silly, this version played it seriously and got rid of the hokey ness and bad effects and acting of some of the other versions in this 60 year long series. While the acting was not really good, or bad in this new version, I did feel that the performances suited the film and the tone they were trying to go for. We have a lot of good actors in this new version and I would not say they were wasted here, but rather they all came out to do a film like this and probably had fun and now they can all go back to the serious and dramatic roles that we are more accustomed to seeing them in. The effects for the film were impressive, but not too flashy, or in your face either and the action was handled just right, so it seemed believable enough without getting too ridiculous, or far fetched with it. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during this film and overall I was entertained which is the job of a film like this. Would I buy it? No. Would, I see it again someday? Maybe. As it stands it works exceedingly well as a summer popcorn film that actually has more to offer on the table than your usual summer blockbusters and has more of a thinking person's mentality to the film and giving it a certain edge of seriousness and taking away all camp and silliness. The film was more about story than explosions, or action and that is one of my main compliments for the film and while it may turn some viewers off I know it will win over more, including people in my camp and stance for these kind of films as well."

","We are facing one of the greatest threats that have been filmed Godzilla. We can appreciate the detailed environment surrounding this colossus as a tiny humanity comes to dealing with their appearance. The inability to control human disasters of this magnitude reminds us how vulnerable we are and the need to survive. <br/><br/>Visually Godzilla meets the expectations of the fans of the kaiju genre. Moreover we will see in its glory this mythical reptile making mischief. However I would add that there is something that ends up not fit in this movie, maybe you can go to see it and realize for yourself. <br/><br/>In conclusion I can say that is a good movie to watch this season and is suitable for the whole family. In addition, management perspectives and proportions will not be disappointed ... even godzilla gives us a pleasant surprise in this, his resurrection."

Tons of good details were missed - this was obviously made by someone who just didn't care. Basically, the art and the science both sucked and the plot and characters were plodding and incidental.<br/><br/>Went to see this with a group of friends, sure it would at least be better than the previous godzilla attempt of the late 90s.

"AaronCapenBanner","7","2","4","28 May 2014"," Godzilla As A Force Of Nature
","Gareth Edwards directed this serious and sober-minded modern remake of the memorable 1954 Japanese original that stars Bryan Cranston as Joe Brody, a former nuclear plant supervisor in Japan who lost his co-worker wife in a near-meltdown, who 15 years later becomes convinced that it was no accident, and after infiltrating the sealed-off area of the plant with his now grown son(played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) discovers to their horror that the situation was worse than they feared, with a gigantic mutated creature on the rampage, searching for an equally mutated mate, but not reckoning on the intervention by a force of nature to restore balance - Godzilla...<br/><br/>Well-made film has outstanding CGI to bring Godzilla to realistic life like never before, with fine acting and an intelligent story balancing the impressive monster fighting and large-scale action scenes. Owes a nod or two to ""Jaws"", which also did not overuse its monster, which this film wisely follows.<br/><br/>First in a series of updated Toho ""monsterverse"" films."
"moviescoundrel","6","2","4","22 May 2014"," Not so Mighty
","The review: I waited a few days to review this hopefully after it set for a bit, it would be better than I remembered. It seemed like it had so much potential. Darker, decent set up, but once the movie hit its so called stride and was supposed to be engaging, climactic, etc.it was not. Monsters were LAME, character performances were most likely given as written. Taylor-Johnson does what he is asked to here which is go from one unlikely scenario to the other, in an obscenely fast way and then goes from one impossible situation to another. People get lost with the odds of never being found again high, and then get found rather easily. My love for this movie however, I'm afraid will never be found. Effects were decent even though I didn't love the CGI monsters.<br/><br/>The Good: Maybe the first half hour or so before the movies get there, when you think the characters and plot are being set up well and you don't know how bad it's going to get.<br/><br/>The Bad: I hated the monsters, the animations, the weak plot, and the many unlikely events. Especially when the film started so gritty and real, it took many turns for the worst."
"tburke85","8","2","4","25 May 2014"," Godzilla is back and better than ever
","Godzilla is back and better than ever. Director Gareth Edwards does a great job of bring this movie to life despite some flaws which I'll get into later. The cast did a good job with what they were given. Aaron Taylor Johnson wasn't as bad as I think some critics made him out to be. His performance isn't Oscar worthy but he's alright as the main character Ford Brody. Ken Wanatabe, Elisabeth Olsen, David Straithan, Juliette Binoche, and Bryan Cranston were believable as their characters. Cranston and Binoche roles however are cut rather short. The special effects are incredible. Godzilla himself and the MUTO's felt very real for a film about giant prehistoric creatures that thrived during a time when the Earth was highly radioactive. I think Godzilla was in it just enough. I'd say he gets maybe 20-25 minutes of screen time mostly during the 2nd half and the climax. The build up to Godzilla's appearance was effective and his atomic fire breath is awesome. So was his roar. He makes his first appearance about 45-50 mins into it. I liked the glimpses we got of him before the full reveal at the Hawaii airport scene. Godzilla's look closely resembled his original one with some differences. The Kaiju fights between him and the MUTO's were cool although there could've been a little more of them. Their fierce final showdown at the end was worth the wait. Some of the characters weren't really developed but it's just a minor criticism. There's action scenes throughout to keep you on the edge and entertained. Overall I really enjoyed it a lot more than the Amazing Spider-man 2 so far this year. I recommend it to any looking for a good monster movie to watch that delivers."
"oscarxp25","8","2","4","25 May 2014"," A return to Scaly Form
","One of the positive things about the new ""Godzilla"" is that it respects the lore of the great big guy. It shows you how off the 1998 version was, even if you liked it. Though this new version is fun to watch and gets a lot right, there still are some bumpy times to be had.<br/><br/>Behind the camera calling the shots this time is Gareth Edwards. Four years ago he was responsible for the the small, but very effecting monster film, ""Monsters"". His skills made that film impressive in the sense that he did it with a very small budget. It was a no brainer to have him make the reboot of Godzilla. Here, his monster is more of a supporting character that gets stuck behind some of the most interesting actors in film today. While some of the story works, other parts fall flat to mediocre story telling and overly dramatic parts. In 1999, an event rocked Tokyo causing a fall out at the Nuclear power plant. One of the victims was the wife of Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston. Any qualms about the other actors are put to rest when Cranston is on screen. Even though he has limited screen time he makes the most of it. His character's motivations are crazy but Cranston makes them sincere and real. While the public was convinced by the government that an earthquake was responsible for the fall out, Joe knows something bigger was at play. One of his escapades lands him in jail. In America, specifically San Francisco, Joe's younger and estranged military son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor Johnson, is home with his own son and beautiful wife, Elle, played by Elizabeth Olsen. He is called to get his father out of jail. After he gets him out he is then whisked away on another one of his father's crazy missions to uncover the conspiracy that began in 1999. We find out that all the radiation from the nuclear tests have created a pair of monster like creatures named, ""MUTO"" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). The more radiation that is present, the more they will grow.<br/><br/>While these MUTOS have been given a scientific reason for existing, Godzilla is given a more mythological one, even though he has been created the same way. According to two scientists, played by Ken Watanbe and Sally Hawkins, Godzilla is nature's way of fighting back against the forces of mankind. ""The ignorance of man is thinking that we are in control of nature and not the other way around"", remarks Watanbe's character. It is a nice set up for why Godzilla exists in this world. It gives the character a bit of mystery. Edwards decisions on the big green guy are ace. The size and weight of him are perfectly captured. You will believe that Godzilla exists and is walking amongst the frightened citizens. The animation of the beast is absolutely breathtaking. Whenever he is on screen he demands your attention and you will give it to him. Edwards teases battles by cutting away from every one outside the final one at the end of the movie. It is a decision that may irritate some but fascinate others. When the final battle does come, it is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie can't rely on the title character to do everything. There has to be some human element to the story. While the story, outside of Godzilla isn't as bad as some might say, it is where the movie does feel a bit wobbly. When Cranston leaves, he actually takes some of the energy with him. All the actors are good, but they are given very little to work with. Scientific evidence comes off as mumble jumble at points. Olsen's character is given nothing more than being the concerned wife who cries a lot. This isn't going to be Shakespearean and she does give it her all. This isn't a knock against Olsen because a lesser actress probably would've destroyed the role and brought the movie down. The ending to the film is very overly dramatic and reminded me of something that should have been stuck in the 90's version of the story. What is a nice touch with the film is that before that ending the movie establishes the fact that Godzilla is just doing his own thing. The movie nicely separated the events of the humans and Godzilla. They were just in his way and he was in theirs. You can't fault the film for this extra cheese final minutes though because outside of that it does do pretty okay. Some of the shots Edwards conceives are a joy to watch, especially in a big theater, because of the epic scope of it all. He films some of the action using the first person technique that adds so much to scene that contributes the danger the characters are in during the monster scenes. One breath taking shot, from the trailer, has one of the paratroopers passing Godzilla on the way down to the ground. The dark clouds quickly fade away and we immediately see Godzilla and a MUTO battling, all in the first person perspective. It really brings home the point of how big and powerful both the MUTOS and Godzilla are and how minuscule the humans are against these things. Edwards establishes the atmosphere quite well through the film. These things are scary and powerful, unlike the walking lizard in the '98 version.<br/><br/>The action movie has evolved with films like ""The Dark Knight"" where the story and acting are as good as the effects. Though sometimes it is nice just to sit back and watch a well made movie that wants to have fun doing its thing. This is what ""Godzilla"" does. It never reaches the lows of some of the brainless movies that crowd our theaters. Edwards stages action with such an amazing eye that makes it both epic and suspenseful."
"saseitz-705-31959","7","2","4","25 May 2014"," Finally, ""Godzilla"" done right.
","It takes special talent to make a satisfying monster movie, and that's what director Gareth Edwards and a talented cast bring to the table in this all-new, very skillful take on Godzilla.<br/><br/>Edwards and Co. take an entirely new approach to the standard Godzilla story: the above-ground atomic weapon tests of the 1950s weren't tests at all, but an attempt to kill Godzilla, whose species had roamed the earth during the time of the dinosaurs, when natural radiation was much stronger than it is now. The tests succeeded only in driving the King of All Monsters back into the ocean.<br/><br/>But Godzilla is not the only one. There are the dangerous MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) who feed on radiation, and who are awakened, ready to breed. And they're hungry.<br/><br/>The acting makes a great difference. If the cast doesn't care, then the audience won't. (That's not always a bad thing. DeForest Kelley trying not to laugh during ""Night of the Lepus"" is one of that movie's best bits.) But Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and David Straithairn, among others, wisely take the approach that what's happening isn't a merry romp through the towers of San Francisco. These events are deadly serious business, and the cast treats the material as though it were Shakespeare. We care about these characters.<br/><br/>Cranston, in particular, gives the film his all. I can truly say that this is the first monster film in which there is a genuinely human and tragic scene, one which could happen in real life and work in a more serious movie. Joe's anguish, agony and loss all come through in closeup, and that moves the audience. The scene does a great deal to erase the silliness of all this film's predecessors, and, more importantly, gives the audience an emotional investment in Joe and his family. <br/><br/>I read one review in which the reviewer called the cast ""overqualified."" That may be, but it is certainly worth it in this case. <br/><br/>The story really gets going 15 years later, when Joe's soldier son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, of the ""Kick-Ass"" films) is summoned to Japan, because Dad's been arrested. It seems as though Joe has become a crank conspiracy theorist, who knows the authorities are covering something up, that the reason for the disaster had to be something other than the official reason. Little do they know.<br/><br/>Once the MUTOs arrive, just hold onto your seats and enjoy the ride. Edwards' adroit use of special effects, his skillful teasing before we see the full Godzilla, and the action scenes move along so well and so swiftly, that the most important problem of monster movies – certain logic holes, for instance – zoom by before anyone can notice them.<br/><br/>At last, Godzilla has become something more than a sumo wrestler in a rubber suit kicking over obvious cardboard models. In the right hands, the King of All Monsters can be entertaining for the right reasons. I can only hope the studio doesn't start chintzing for the next one. It'll be worth spending the money."

","Being born back in the day, I was a fan of the original GODZILLA and looked forward to seeing this version. The Italian car company commercial further added to the hype - Godzilla crashing through a city, wrecking havoc on all who were in his way. GODZILLA (2014) was a let-down. While the basic story line was o.k., the main point of the movie seemed to be mans involvement in the plot, and the two prehistoric - yet alien looking - creatures that Godzilla did battle with. While the CGI work was outstanding, and Godzilla himself never looked better, he was in the movie only a fraction of the time I would have expected for something titled - GODZILLA. Yes, the scenes of his battles were epic in nature and I have to admit I felt like I was 50 years younger as I watched them but, it was too little, too late. Perhaps an edited version with 30 to 45 minutes less of all that was unnecessary and not 'Godzilla' might make this movie more of a classic in future days, but for me, as the movie stands, I was disappointed."

Other than the dad all the other characters are very bland and honestly not important at all. Most of the time your like ' all right hey move out of the way, where is Godzilla?' The opening scene is really the only one that is pretty emotional and you actually care about the characters. One thing I was impressed with was that there were so many scenes where they could have made the movie cheesy but they did, (for example, the main character riding on Godzillas back, throwing some reigns on him, and going forth and destroying the monster.) So overall a good huge monster, one timer. I wouldn't buy it and maybe watch it if a friend wanted to."

","The Godzilla (or, in Japanese, Gojira) franchise features a series of 28 original Japanese Kaiju (""monster"") movies. Inspired by the success of 'King Kong', the first 'Godzilla' was released in 1954 and was extremely influential, and it was adapted by Americans into 'Godzilla, King of the Monsters!'. Godzilla inspired many other movies, video games and comics. Four Godzilla movies have been produced in America and one in Italy (also known as Cozzilla),while North Korea released 'Pulgasari', which was similar to Godzilla. The monster was created as an allegory of the effects and consequences of the hydrogen bomb, and represented the Japanese fear of the Hiroshima disaster happening again. This 'Godzilla' is a reboot of the one from 1954, and not a remake of the badly received 1998 version.<br/><br/>In 1999, a couple of researchers are investigating the finding of a massive skeleton under an excavation site in the Philippines, along with a strange cocoon attached to it, and one that has apparently hatched. In Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is worried that the periodical 'earthquakes' occurring lately may cause damage unless the nuclear power plant he's working in is shut down. As his wife (Juliette Binoche) approaches the reactor to check it for damage, a strong tremor causes a breach in the reactor, Joe's wife's death, and the collapse of the building. Fifteen years later, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) lives in the USA but is called to Japan to bail his father out, who's been trespassing in order to find out what really happened the day his wife died. At the 'abandoned' nuclear plant, that has been turned into a military-protected research center, what happened in 1999 starts happening again.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the two characters that looked like main characters in the trailer – Godzilla and Joe (Bryan Cranston) – are the ones you'll see the least in the movie. I didn't find this characteristic to be that bad, in regards to Godzilla. It manages to build tension and expectation as you wait for the monster to appear, and it also gives you time to appreciate the monsters Godzilla's fighting – the so-called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). But the fact that Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the 'human lead', instead of Bryan Cranston, was just bad. Because Mr Kick-Ass isn't a good actor, has no charisma, and the public doesn't get anything from the script that can help sympathize with him. He has a wife and small child, and I could really care less, because most of the (too many) actors in the movie are just expendable and forgettable. The dialogues don't help, either.<br/><br/>On the bright side, like I said, the movie is tense. Many scenes occur at night, in silence – when all of a sudden a huge monster appears and destroys everything while shrieking maniacally, which is just beautiful. The CGI is great and the cinematography doesn't disappoint, just like the majestic soundtrack. There aren't as many action scenes as one would expect, and the MUTOs and Godzilla are gradually revealed, up until the final big fight. The fact that some serious effort has been put into creating an interesting story – and actually, the mere fact that there is a story, gives this movie an automatic thumbs up. All in all, this 'Godzilla' is an interesting, tense, fun monster movie to watch, that can be appreciated by newbies and long-term fans of the franchise equally.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"jessehammertime","5","2","4","23 May 2014"," Three Dimensional Monsters. One Dimensional Humans
","First off, the ten star reviews are completely out of hand and I would take any of them with a grain of salt. Godzilla a perfect movie? Stop. Just stop.<br/><br/>For all the attention and detail paid to the monsters in this film, (oh, and Godzilla is big, bad and beautiful), the focus on making the humans believable is so dull and blurry it has the effect of making you feel drugged. Unpleasantly, hospitalized drugged. Even the strongest performance in the film, courtesy of Bryan Cranston, of course, is pretty much one emotion, angrily maudlin. And once the semi-relatable anchor of this performance is pulled up, way too early, this ship sinks faster than a tugboat in a MUTO's wake. Our lead is boring and unremarkable and when he puts on a military uniform he blends into the background, indistinguishable from the other soldiers who barely speak. And Ken Watanabe's scientist stumbles, mumbles and stares into space offering up barely there advice that isn't heeded by anyone and who can blame them? He seems drunk.<br/><br/>Director Edwards may have wanted to take his eyes off the storyboards and CGI rendering Macs for just a second to go over the actual script a little more. Clunky dialogue, leaps in logic and plot holes you could pilot an Akula through bring new meaning to incoherent. There are so many head-scratchers in this my scalp was raw. My favorite, being a resident of the Bay Area, is when it's pouring apocalyptic rain in San Francisco, Oakland is somehow bright and sunny. Now, I know we have some micro-climates here but, really? The 5 stars come from the monsters themselves. While the MUTOs are sort of unimaginative, a cross between the Cloverfield monster and the bugs from Starship Troopers, they are damn believable and have weight and presence on screen. Godzilla is incredible and a sight to behold when the cameras aren't constantly cutting away.<br/><br/>This was a real wasted opportunity and I am disheartened to learn that Edwards is helming one of the Star Wars films as I was hoping that series was going to bring back the attention to characters. Sadly, it seems not."
"i-templar","5","2","4","22 May 2014"," Good. Could have been better.
","--- Non-spoiler part --- Good movie, better than previous Godzilla from Hollywood. Could have been better with more focus on certain characters, especially the main feature of the movie.<br/><br/>--- SPOILER PART --- (stop reading now if you don't want the movie to be SPOILED for you) What the hell is with focusing on the son??? And how dare they kill off Heisenberg so early!!! The trailers misled me into believing that Walter White had so much more to do in the movie. Instead, the best shining actor is killed off so early leaving nothing more than a mediocre actor and actress trying so hard to win empathy from the viewers but ultimately failing in the process. <br/><br/>The movie is Godzilla. Instead, you get so much focus on human interactions with each other that Godzilla seemed totally irrelevant to the movie itself. Godzilla's total appearances amount to nothing more than 15 minutes MAX. And these are divided into short glimpses of the actual GODZILLA.<br/><br/>You are thrown left, right, and centre focusing on the Rookie Admiral, the Clueless Doctor, the Irrelevant Son and Daughter-in-law of Walter, and all other extras all trying so hard in their own efforts to do something to look busy and occupied, and hogging screen time away from GODZILLA.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie cannot match up to any of the CG monster fighting movies, or even scenes with monsters in them because of the lack of focus. Pacific Rim makes this movie look amateur; Pacific Rim's trailers promised you monster brawls and followed through with this promise and gave you more than you expected. Godzilla broke its promise to deliver enough of both GODZILLA and Heiseinberg.<br/><br/>I must say they did a good job at weaving together the origins of GODZILLA and the MUTOs, but fail to deliver a satisfying monster battle, and even worse, failing to deliver what the movie is titled after."

","It is too long. Most of the action takes place at night and it appears dark on screen.<br/><br/>You would think the title character would appear early in the movie, even in a pre- title sequence, not this time. The sheriff doesn't ride into town for at least forty five minutes. He dispatches the bad guys and swims off into the sunset.<br/><br/>The people story line is well developed but are we cheering for people? No. Bring on the big guy. It is almost a cameo appearance by the King of Monsters.<br/><br/>The movie should be seen on the big screen with big sound. It is a good time at the movies but you feel short changed Godzilla wise."
"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","7","2","4","22 May 2014"," An uneven, but entertaining film that suffers from lack of Godzilla.
","Godzilla is one of the most well known and recognizable movie characters of all time. His name and image has been ingrained into our pop culture vocabulary for decades. Even people who have never seen a Godzilla film, know the name. That's the definition of an iconic character.<br/><br/>With that being said, I fall into the category of people that has never actually seen a Godzilla film. Although I'm passionate about cinema, I've just never been particularly interested in the story. Sure, I've seen parts of the original 1954 Japanese film, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Despite being an iconic figure, it wasn't a nuclear bomb that almost killed Godzilla, it was Hollywood. In 1998 Roland Emmerich's Godzilla was released starring Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno. The film is now a Hollywood punchline and infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. The 1998 version of Godzilla is also known for possibly killing more careers than its titular star kills civilians.<br/><br/>The good news is, nothing ever truly dies in Hollywood - it's just reborn. Boasting some of the best trailers you will ever see, Godzilla once again took a strong grip on pop culture. The trailer spread like wild fire through social media making Godzilla the must-see movie of the early summer. Godzilla is perfect blockbuster escapist fare and a perfect night out for anybody looking to turn their brain off for two hours. There's not a ton of great dialogue or character development. It's a Godzilla film, this is to be expected.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a quick montage showing us what happened to Godzilla in 1954. We are soon introduced to Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, in an effort to capitalize on his post Heisenberg high. Brody is a scientist working at a Japanese nuclear power plant. The film quickly fast forwards 15 years and Cranston's brilliant scientist has now been disgraced and reduced to a jittery wacko. Or so he seems to everybody else. Like with any disaster film, Cranston isn't crazy; in fact, he knows something is about to go horribly wrong but nobody will listen to him.<br/><br/>As usual, Cranston is on top of his game. You can see the desperation in every wrinkle of his forehead and can hear it in every word he utters. Unfortunately, the focus soon shifts to Brody's son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson really hasn't done much. I enjoyed him in the Kick-Ass films, but he's never struck me as a particularly strong actor. When a gigantic CGI lizard has more facial expressions than your male lead, there's a problem.<br/><br/>The more of the film Taylor-Johnson is asked to carry, the faster it starts to go downhill. Another unfortunate part of the film is how they waste Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Taylor-Johnson's wife. Like many female characters in films like this, Olsen's character is reduced to sitting at home wringing her hands waiting for news about her husband. Elizabeth Olsen is a great actress, but she's not going to break away from the shadow of her famous Full House siblings if she keeps choosing roles like this. Got it, dude?<br/><br/>Maybe the biggest grievance I have with the film is the fact that Godzilla has his own film hijacked from him by two creatures most people have never heard of. While the two massive insect-like creatures are creating havoc, Godzilla is riding the pine. I paid money to watch Godzilla stomp on buildings, not to watch two over grown insects have sex. <br/><br/>I know it sounds like I didn't like the film, but that's not the case. The first half of the film is especially strong. Godzilla also features some of the best music you will hear in a film all year, as well as some truly breathtaking special effects. The film also boasts a satisfying climax. It's so awesome, it made me wish there was more of that throughout the film.<br/><br/>With Godzilla's success at the box office, it's safe to assume that he will stay in our current pop culture landscape for a little longer. I just hope Godzilla gets to flex his muscles more in the next film."
"daniell san","4","2","4","22 May 2014"," was this supposed to be a godzilla movie?
","The movie looked great. Special effects were really well done. The cast was absolutely great, but this didn't feel like it was a monster movie. I came in expecting to see a Godzilla movie. To see monsters fight each other. For some reason the director decided that whenever Godzilla is about to get in a fight it would be better to cut to something else. The first time it happened I was kinda annoyed that they didn't show the fight. The second time it happened it got frustrating. Even the final battle didn't show enough of the monsters fighting. This movie could have been really good had they actually shown the fights. I feel cheated. I came out of the movie not satisfied. If I knew they weren't going to show the fights, then I wouldn't have gone to see the movie in theaters. Too bad really, 'cause the rest of the movie looks great. It's just not a monster movie.<br/><br/>The best comparison I can think of is that when you watch a porn movie and just when things are about to get interesting, they show you news or sports clips instead of the action."

","i'm a huge Godzilla fan just to get that out of the way. i have been since i was a kid and my father would show me the old Toho movies in our basement. i was so excited when i heard they were doing a new Godzilla, and it would be American, and we could FINALLY have a replacement for that terrible piece of junk they made in the 90s. the trailer came out and it looked pretty good so I couldn't wait. then I went to see it opening night and overall I thought it was just so-so. I was a little disappointed because you barely even saw Godzilla really. there was so much time spent talking about it, and almost seeing it, it was just kind of annoying in the end. when you finally did see Godzilla though it looked great. the effects were pretty good and the destruction was perfect. but I didn't like any of the main actors so much because I didn't believe their performances. oh well. I'm sure there will be a sequel and maybe they will finally 100% get it right the next time!!!"
"amit-naor","5","2","4","21 May 2014"," The monster come back and it is bad-ass
","So I was never was to much of Godzilla fan, and I didn't know what to expect with this film. The movie exactly like all of the recent action movies now days try to give as more realistic and serious world, and while I like those type of movies it has the same problem that ""man of steel"" (man of steel is worse than Godzilla though). That problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously but at the same time is dealing with something so silly and unrealistic that it just create a very unfortunate situation when the movie try to grab you, but some very cheap writing and plot holes stop you, but I did enjoy the film and the final climax was one of the most enjoyable action scenes I saw this year (and with movies like captain America the winter soldier), I didn't go with 3D but except of one specific shot it didn't feel missing. I will also say that the movie had some great visual style and some shots were just beautiful to watch. Over all I wanted more but it was enough, the actors were OK for the most part and surprisingly Godzilla actually gets kind if a personality. I recommend going to the film with friends."

Godzilla was Joe Louis. Godzilla was Ali. Godzilla had attitude. Godzilla was cool. Those little kids believed the dragon would come through, and even though Megalon or Ghidora would sometimes get the upper hand, the King of the Monsters found a way to triumph. Watching this film, I was thrown back to those days. While the film was not as spectacular as prior modern versions, it was Godzilla as Tomoyuki Tanaka envisioned him.

","Godzilla is back and he is set to smack down with the great monsters and the big blockbusters 2014 has to offer. Godzilla (2014) washes out the bad taste of Roland Emmerich's very dumb effort as this new version pays respect and homage to the great Japanese series.<br/><br/>In the Pacific Ocean since 1954 a multi-national organisation has been hunting a mysterious creature, using nuclear weapons to kill it. In 1999 a mining company make a discovery and awaken a beast which causes a nuclear meltdown in Janjira, Japan. Flash-forward to the present day Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is an explosives expert for the American military and is called to Japan when his father Joe (Bryan Cranston) is arrested for exploring the quarantine zone, planning to expose the cover-up of the disaster. But this could lead to humanity facing its greatest threat.<br/><br/>Monsters' Gareth Edwards was hired to direct this reboot of the series and it is clear his experience of that film was influential on Godzilla. His sense of world building is shown, particularly the destruction and abandonment of Janjira, the chaos that was caused and large scenes such as a tomb for a mysterious creature. Even small things like the use of TV news in the background as it highlights events internationally. Monsters was a film with impressive special effects for its budget of $500,000 and with Godzilla he has $160 Million: a budget he effectively uses to bring Godzilla to life and showing a global scale. His version of Godzilla plays out a little like what a Monsters prequel could have been.<br/><br/>Edwards and his writing team show that they have a great knowledge and respect for the franchise, knowing what works in the series whilst taking the serious approach and accepts the environmental themes of the original 1954 film. As a monster film you get the fun massive creatures trying to beat the hell out of each other and keeping the human drama as civilians look to survive and the military try and fight creatures that treat humans as nothing more than bugs. Fans of the series will notice little Easter Eggs and homage's.<br/><br/>At times Godzilla plays like a classic disaster film as the monsters are unstoppable force of nature as ordinary people watch on and the military fight helplessly against destructive creatures. The human drama is just as important as the monsters as they sort out family dramas and fight for survival. Yet at times this element comes off as melodramatic and heavy-handed, despite the actors' best efforts. Godzilla is very much a film about the build-up to the fight between the monsters, allowing us to appreciate the battle, but the drawback is the waiting as we only get glimpses. Even when the monsters are fighting, the military are still in play.<br/><br/>Edwards makes a visually impressive film with solid action sequences, particularly at the end and he keeps a brisk pace constantly. The idea of what the monsters feed on makes them an even more potent threat. But other ideas are on the derivative, being used in many other sci-fi films. Examples include the military diving into San Francisco being similar to the wingsuit jump in Transformers: Dark of the Moon and the preventing of monsters having offspring is the same plot point from 1998 version of Godzilla.<br/><br/>Godzilla assumes a great cast of actors, Taylor-Johnson, Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and David Strathaim from The Bourne Ultimatum. This would be a cast that any production would be happy to have. Cranston and Watanabe are the guys whose performance is the best and give the most dialogue porn. But Olsen does not get to show off her obvious talents as Ford's wife. Fun fact, this year Taylor-Johnson and Olsen are husband and wife, next year they will be twins in The Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The excellent composer Alexandre Desplat supplies a truly unique sounding score, a mostly bombastic piece of music that plays for a large portion of the film. With The Grand Budapest Hotel, Desplat has had a very good year.<br/><br/>The 2014 version is respectful to its source material and offers a lot of big monster fun as more major cities get destroyed. It's great to hear that Godzilla roar once again.<br/><br/>Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com"
"StevePulaski","8","2","4","19 May 2014"," An exercise in rousing action and style
","Gareth Edwards' Godzilla is the only Godzilla film I have ever seen, leaving me nothing to compare this new adaptation to whatsoever. My knowledge of Godzilla movies is similar to my knowledge on the Rocky sequels, none of which I've seen; I can tell you a number of the villains and some of the plot-points but nothing so much as a description as to why each film deserves to exist. What I can say is that the latest installment in the hulking monster's filmography is a marginally successful spectacle of special effects and impending doom, featuring a great array of strong actors and slowburn action.<br/><br/>The story opens in Japan by showing two egg-shaped objects, one of which hatched and subsequently entering the sea. Nearby, a nuclear plant starts experiencing rapidly growing seismic activity, with the nuclear plant's supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) running out of options as the plant eventually works its way into an all-out nuclear meltdown. In the midst of the meltdown, Joe's wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) dies inside, and the entire area surrounding the nuclear plant is quarantined and labeled uninhabitable.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, we acquaint with Joe's older son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is an explosive ordinance disposal officer in the Navy, living with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and kid. Ford and Joe reconnect in Japan, where Joe is hellbent on trying to label what caused the earthquake and the nuclear meltdown of Japan. As we know, there can only be one real explanation and that's the presence of a gigantic, lizard monstrosity by the name of Godzilla.<br/><br/>For starters, as a non-Godzilla fan, there is a thought that has been racing through my mind for quite sometime. Traditionally, Godzilla films were characterized by their low budget special effects, cheesy acting, and sometimes hilariously bad plot-points. Isn't cleaning it up to fit the standards of the populous defeating the purpose? Isn't making the film exist on a larger, more polished scale, where action and special effects are all backed up by hundreds of millions of dollars kind of against the film's original blueprints? That's not saying that Godzilla immediately fails, but perhaps it's just the shock of seeing once cheap, rather unremarkable material in terms of aesthetic and look all of a sudden get the extremely expensive upgrade.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film makes sure to at least have us spend some time with the human characters of the picture before Godzilla is even brought into the picture. We see ample amounts of Cranston and Taylor-Johnson - who gives Godzilla a run for his money in terms of how much screen time he is given - and writer Max Borenstein eases his way into introducing the monster. He may ease a bit too much, in fact, seeing as when we do get to see Godzilla, it's still in glimpses fit for teaser trailers rather than the actual, feature-length product. While Borenstein pleasantly avoids overexposure of his titular character, he manages to keep him a tad too humble and limited, preventing larger, more thought-provoking ideas concerning the character to come through.<br/><br/>Aside from the slowburn writing, Gareth Edwards' direction is easy to praise for one particular reason - he keeps things clear and easy to follow in terms of action. Given Godzilla's size and ability, the film could've been a nonstop parade of special effects that captured nothing but the cold tendencies of action filmmaking. Edwards keeps things alive and stylistic, infusing long-shots and large-scale shots that encompass all the action, rather than extreme close-ups that do nothing other than confuse and disorient when edited together.<br/><br/>Godzilla also gets additional points for not immediately feeling like a project that exists for the sole purpose of setting up a sequel or a franchise. Films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Prometheus seem to have a difficult time living in the now and dealing with the present, and instead attempt to setup story lines and characters they're not even sure are going to materialize and how. Godzilla manages to stay fixated on the current issues facing its characters rather than looking to set up its third and fourth sequel on its first run.<br/><br/>The film will likely appeal to the masses as a piece of rousing action and style; I have no idea what hardened Godzilla fans will make of it. There's fun to be had in the form of style and slowburn drama, for one, and the excitement that comes from seeing Godzilla is something to marvel. As I stated, I was hoping for something to have a bit more fun with itself and utilize a more basic aesthetic. Despite being the grandfather of all monsters, there seems to be something rather interchangeable here. I fear that Godzilla is on track to getting the treatment many superheros, beloved movie characters, and cartoon icons are already getting which is ubiquitous marketing and conventional setups in mainstream motion pictures.<br/><br/>Starring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. Directed by: Gareth Edwards."

","I wasn't sure what I was going to think about the new Godzilla movie, but I was pretty interested to see what direction Gareth Edwards would take the film. I really enjoyed his film ""Monsters"", but wouldn't have picked him to direct a high action Monster flick based off of that film. But I ended up very pleased with Edwards' take on Godzilla.<br/><br/>From the look of the trailer I was worried this would end up being a disaster movie instead of a monster movie. By that I mean I felt there was a possibility this would be more ""Day After Tomorrow"" than ""Destroy All Monsters"". But my worries quickly went away once I saw Godzilla in action. The film does a good job of modernizing him but capturing his classic essence at the same time. <br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed ""Godzilla"". It had a interesting enough story and it was packed with monster action. Don't expect a masterpiece, but if you are looking for some monster fun this is perfect. 8/10"

","A nuclear meltdown 15 years ago bears striking resemblance to some current issues with the area now. What secrets are the government hiding away in the quarantined zone? When a freak of nature breaks lose from the cocoon it was encased in, another comes in to restore balance to the nature of things, while we try to get in his way....he is Godzilla.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in Godzilla, so I'll give it credit for trying to bring something to the table that the original Americanized version did not. The size and scope of this entry is bigger and better. Gareth Edwards, the guy behind the independent special effects heavy flick Monsters, has been given a monster size of a budget to direct this decades old creature and possible restart a franchise. His delivery of Godzilla is a mess, but it beautiful mess.<br/><br/>The film is gorgeous to look at. Seeing the destruction of the world while these massive beasts tango is a marvellous achievement. Edwards teases the audience a lot here. Just when we are about to see the showdown, he cuts away and we only get glimpses of it on the television. A neat way to build up our anticipation for the destruction that is sure to ensue in the climax. He does this one too many times though and the teases become irritating. Show us what we want: Destruction, Mayhem, GODZILLA. <br/><br/>The special effects are astounding, that's a given. Edwards fully develops these creatures in a life like environment and the destruction they cause feels real. The size and scope of these creatures are leaps and bounds over what Emmerich gave us in the late 90's. The fighting between the monsters is a little rough, Del Toro has more of a craft to it with Pacific Rim. Here it feels more like a brawl, rightfully so. <br/><br/>Godzilla does the cardinal sin of false advertising. I can't really fault the film for this, but I do feel that it was a mistake creatively to kill off certain characters early in the film. There is no emotional catalyst for our lead hero here. It feels forced to try and make those connections it desperately wants the viewer to see and brings the film to sometimes boring sections. The human characters fill out their clichéd roles fine enough. Cranston is dynamite as the guy who is right about ominous things, but nobody believes him. Johnson is our lead, a good guy with father issues, trying to make it back home to his family and be the dad he never had. David Strathairn does his Jason Bourn military shtick and finally we have two actors who do absolutely nothing in the film. First is Ken Watanabe with very few lines, but serious looks here and there. He's our ""let's explain everything"" guy. The other is Elizabeth Olsen, who has done excellent work, as the wife of our lead. Her job is....I'm still confused here because she isn't even the damsel in distress. She is screen filler. Then last, but not least we have Godzilla, who is barely in the film. <br/><br/>Cardboard characters are to be expected in a monster flick....but aren't monsters expected to be in monster flicks? The guy's name is on the poster and Godzilla has the least amount of screen time here. The other creatures are cool looking as well and I really got into the ""history"" of when they first showed up and stuff, I just wish they explored that a tad bit more. The film is insanely serious. No real moments of brevity. <br/><br/>I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, in the hopes that they take this in some kind of direction and not chug out Godzilla VS whatever creature the fans want now....I have my hopes."

","Let's be fair. It's not the best Science Fiction movie of the year. That honor still belongs to ""Captain America"", but it surpasses the mess of ""Spiderman (2014)"". It's truly a valiant effort to revive the glory of that amazing beast. We don't really understand its origin. There's very little mythology but much to admire and enjoy, and the creature has literally tons of personality to boast.<br/><br/>Let's get the bad out of the way first. Why is it that recent special effect films are so dark and hard to see. It defeats the purpose of having to pay extra for those stupid 3D glasses. If you want to charge a premium, make the best possible film, and change the setting from rainy, cloudy and dark to something that can really give us the best possible experience. Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg can do it. Why is it so difficult for the rest of the directors? Second, get yourself a story editor and check what you have before you put it on film. It's going to be expensive, and it'd better make a little sense when we see the final product. It is a horrible experience to sit through long and boring movies that gives us nothing to savor. ""Godzilla"" has its share of those moments when nothing really happens, and there's so many shots of military equipment we can handle. We went to see the film to see the monsters fight each other and demolish cities. We don't want lovey-dovey stuff, and we chose not to be scientists, so take the overload of technical jargon out of the way. Hope the sequel shows that.<br/><br/>If you are going to hire great actors, give them something to do. Four great performers here stand around, uttering borderline nonsense or just staring at each other in the most painful ways because they are supposed to be feeling frustrated (according to the storyline), and they are probably very upset because it must be hell to be doing this in front of green screens or a very thin script. Binoche's role could have been played by a no-name actress, and what in the world is Watanabe doing here, other than lending some panache to the film? Cranston could be sleepwalking here, and I would hate to say that Taylor-Johnson could win an Oscar for ""Kickass"" in comparison to his role here.<br/><br/>Now the good stuff. ""Godzilla"" himself is a superb creation. Finally a monster that looks scary, and that we can cheer for since he's our savior. He actually moves realistically and makes a hell of a fighting/grunting/battle cry. I love to see him do that, and this is as much fun as watching some combination of Zumo and Wrestling, with a side of debris and atomic waste. I was so into the fight that I forgot the lizard himself could spit atomic fire. That was so cool.<br/><br/>The ""villains"" (bad monsters) are also something worth seeing. It would have been more fun if we could see more of them. We have to strain our eyes through all that smoke, rain, shadows, and a myriad of obstacles blocking the way. Why? We paid to see the animals, not millions of dollars on those other wasteful effects. I might want to see something else in the sequel, and I mean really SEE them. However, these two kick that horrid Electro character from the spidey movie.<br/><br/>The sound was terrific. We were surrounded by the right combination of explosion, noise, screeching howls, booming electro magnetic waves and the works. The visual effects were a bit more disappointing, but I am glad that the film makers went for Honolulu and San Francisco. New York is an awesome place to trash, but we had enough of it, and L.A. could probably look better after it's destroyed.<br/><br/>Anyway, go and root for ""Godzilla"". The audience clapped and cheered. Maybe there will be a director's cut and we'll have less talking and waiting and more of the good old lizard. A winner!!!"

","The movie was quite good. While it started off slow it did picked up towards the end. Won't lie, however, there were flaws when it comes to a strong story and character development, but hey not every single movie can be perfect so people (especially you haters and annoying trolls) should just back off and stop crying over small things because Godzilla did better than a certain movie that came out on May 2nd. Love it or hate it, Godzilla delivered some memorable moments.It might not be one of the best summer movies in 2014 but at least it's better than Godzilla 1998.<br/><br/>Just so you know.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wish Godzilla nothing but the best of luck, and hopefully in the near future a sequel will be made next year."
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","4","18 May 2014"," Godzilla finally gets some justice for 21st century movie fans
","""The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in their control and not the other way around. Let them fight.""<br/><br/>Godzilla is by far the best film of 2014 in the visual department thanks to some stunning special effects and beautiful cinematography. It is different from last year's Pacific Rim in that you get far less action scenes and much more teases. Some people had a problem with this, but I loved this approach from director Gareth Edwards allowing the tension to slowly build and not making this just one giant battle sequence after another. What didn't work for me in Pacific Rim, worked perfectly for me in Godzilla because I got exactly what I wanted. The human drama might have been weak, but it was enough to engage me and make me care for them as destruction was heading their way. Some may argue that a film about Godzilla should focus on the monster and not just have it on screen for a mere 10 minutes, but I disagree because without seeing him, his presence is felt throughout the film. We may not have gotten the full scale monster that we were expecting at the beginning, but the way Edwards teased the audience by showing just small parts of Godzilla or the path of destruction it left behind was enough to engage me and leave me wanting more. By doing so, Edwards kept the audience engaged and slowly built some memorable and gripping climactic scenes towards the end. It is what other great films like Jaws, Jurassic Park, or even Alien have done, and Edwards inspired by them borrowed those elements and directed a remarkable blockbuster film. If you thought that Godzilla should be on screen for almost the entirety of the film in order for it to be the true star, than you were mistaken because even though it isn't on screen much, its psychological presence is felt throughout the film turning it into the real star. This argument reminded me of Hitchcock's Rebecca which was a film that centered on the title character without ever showing her once on screen, but her presence dominated every single scene just like Godzilla does here. Godzilla's presence is felt throughout the entire movie and that is what distinguishes this film from Roland Emmerich's 1998 version which may have had more monster on screen, but with disastrous results.<br/><br/>Ever since Ishiro Honda directed the original 1954 film, Godzilla has remained the king of all monsters in cinema. After an impressive debut in 2010 with his small indie film, Monsters, director Gareth Edwards was given a much bigger monster to work with. With a larger budget and an all-star cast, Edwards had a heavy load on his shoulders, but he delivered. The screenplay co-written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham may be the weakest link in the film, but it works nonetheless. The film opens by introducing us to Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) who is responsible for the security at a Japanese reactor plant. His wife, Sandra (Juliette Binoche) also works at the plant and their young son, Ford (CJ Adams) studies at a nearby school. Joe has been picking up some strange signals after a series of quakes had affected the region, but his officials refuse to allow him to shut down the plant. What appears to be a big earthquake ends up destroying the plant and Joe is forced to shut it down leaving his wife and hundreds of workers underground contaminated by the nuclear reactor's leak. Fifteen years later we see Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) all grown up returning to San Francisco from his military service to his wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and his young son, Sam (Carson Bolde). Elle receives a call from Japan that night, and it's the police who claim to have arrested Joe for invading private property. Ford has to travel to Japan to bail his father out of jail and convince him to come back home with him, but what they end up discovering there will change their lives forever.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the performance from Bryan Cranston (after the success of Breaking Bad, I don't think there is anyone who doesn't like this guy) and I thought he gave the film a powerful dramatic narrative. Aaron Taylor-Johnson may not have what it takes for the lead role, but he delivered. The best dramatic moments took place during the beginning of the film and they were enough to keep me interested in what was going on. I really thought Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche, David Strathairn, and Ken Watanabe were all underused. They are all talented actors and should have been given stronger characters, but they all felt like cardboard cutout characters. Watanabe's character especially didn't seem to serve no other purpose in the film than to inform the audience and explain what was going on. The human drama along with the screenplay didn't work as well, but the spectacular visuals and great action scenes carried this film a long way. The score by Alexandre Desplat is also spectacular and helped set the tone of the film. The final 15 minutes of the film are gripping and there are also several memorable scenes like the one that takes place in Hawaii or the HALO parachute jump scene. I'm not one usually blown away by CGI, but this time I was really impressed with Godzilla. This isn't a perfect film, it has many flaws, but it works way better than other recent disaster or monster related films."

","I just watched this movie today and wow this film is amazing! We finally got a true American Godzilla film! Although this film does have its flaws. The main problem I have with this movie is; it focused too much on his enemies and it didn't feel like Godzilla was the main character. It definitely needed a lot more Godzilla! Also, the story and the character development was a little bland. The trailers make out Bryan Cranston to be the main character but he doesn't even have much screen time which I was a little disappointed with. Apart from it's flaws, this movie had a lot of good things about it. The battle scenes were outstanding! The CGI was very well done. His new enemies were very interesting and unique and there were some really emotional scenes in it. Gareth Edwards did a great job with this movie. He has a huge directing career ahead of him and I thank him for bringing us this film. A solid 8/10."

The plot is kinda shameful honestly, there weren't much interesting characters as I thought there would be but expect for the one character, the father. The father was by far the interesting one and he knows that something wasn't right after the death of his wife, he knew that it wasn't just a mass destruction, it was caused by something bigger. Unfortunately he dies by fallen pieces of buildings and metal scraps, kinda disapointed... but Godzilla is the big role of the movie, the big reptilian monster is back at it again but he instead saved humanity against weird spider things that I forgot what they were called, they probably had a name but kinda forgettable.

This is a very talky film, and that hurts it in my opinion, if i wanted to watch a film with lots of human emotions, I'd rather watch the Green Mile, this is a Godzilla film for hell sakes, not an Academy Award winner. Now the positives, it looks amazing the creature effects are phenomenal, Godzilla is fantastic when he finally appears on screen, more then halfway through the movie, it's kind of upsetting a wasted opportunity, I wanted more chaos and destruction and monsters fighting then we got, instead of listening to the boring humans. Overall I'm being a little to generous with my rating, but as a massive Godzilla fan I enjoyed it for the most part, I just prefer the big rubber suits of the original Toho films, some would agree with me. 6/10."

","I initially viewed this in the theater when the film opened and this review is long overdue. In anticipation, or more accurately hope of the next film being good I revisited this movie this morning. And it was even worse than my first time.<br/><br/>After the utter travesty that Godzilla 1999 was, how is it that a major reboot is handed two writers that have neither a solid history or film under their belt - one much more than the other? And how, or why is it that the director's chair is handed to someone that made a 'monster' film with no monsters in it? Seems on paper it's just as horrid a choice as it was in the end. Want to see a Godzilla film ultimately about a human protagonist being everywhere at the right time with plot armor that would make any major Game of Thrones (HBO) character jealous? Want it topped off with blatantly generic, unpolished writing, complete with bland generic characters? This might be for you then... But it sure irritated me throughout. I grew up watching Godzilla and friends every Saturday, and this my friends, is not what we should have been given. With the exception of Cranston and Watanabe the characters and acting is on par with the 1999 'Godzilla' film. The dialog is equally awful. On Godzilla approaching Hawaii to intercept the generic MUTO a Navy crewman on a carrier reports ""Object incoming from the Pacific."" Most people should realize that the Hawaiian Islands are surrounded by the Pacific... This film is chock full of this sort of thing. Due to the inability to write these writers had to construct ridiculous acts to fill the plot; such as putting nukes on a train for San Francisco when they could have been slung under helos. I really could go on and on, and then some, but you get the point. And the cherry on top? How about constant cuts away from the reason why we watched this film to begin with - Godzilla. These cuts are so frequent that it almost tricks, or rather convinces you, that they were watching their CGI budget. Or how about watching his real appearance through a TV in some kids living room from across the room.<br/><br/>I'm literally dying to know how some of these people get paid to write for screen.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my fears regarding Godzilla: King of Monsters... One of these two writing duds remained on board for it. Thankfully there some fresh minds in there with Dougherty, but looking at his writing history also has me in fear due to his involvement with superhero films and making three versions of the same horror movie.<br/><br/>Godzilla 2014 - 2/10"

","This movie had potential, but in the end it just sucked you know what. The human characters really weren't very compelling. The decision to make Godzilla some kind of monstrous savior smacks of the child-friendly Toho Studio releases of the 1960s-70s. They should have gone for the dark, destructive, nihilistic force instead of the kid-friendly version. There was no need for other monsters in this one. And some of the scenes, like where a character falls over 100 feet into three feet of water and is unscathed, are even less realistic than the monsters. Finally, when will people stop casting members of the Olsen family?"

","Anything you place on the screen, if not by Michael Bay, will be a piece of art compared to that one of 1998; and this one holds it true. Better acting, better plot and better characterization of Godzilla as we expected to see it. There is a problem though; as you see the movie you may see similarities to another movie, 'Cloverfield', and the reason, besides watching big monsters leveling a city, may be because of gimmicks that instead of 'giving personality' to the film, actually end up screwing it. In Cloverfield you get some guy unable to hold steady a camcorder with no image stabilization, and apparently the guy also has seizures and films the whole thing while trying to keep the equilibrium while juggling chainsaws with the other hand; there is no other explanation as to why they moved the camera so much that makes the spectator want kick both the director and the camera men in the teeth, as 'trying to give the impression of an amateur camera man' would not justify it. There is no problem with shaky images here; instead, somebody though that it would be a good idea to show a black screen and every once in a while show a silhouette or a border of something that you may recognize or not; sometimes you may even think that you are watching a shadow puppet show with some radio-drama on the background.

","Did I like the new 'Godzilla' film, the first in 16 years? I really wanted to, but while there's some good aspects, they're counterbalanced by plenty of bad things. First, the ""storyline"" - two MUTO (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"")'s are awakened (why now?) and converge on San Francisco (why there?). Godzilla shows up to fight them (why?).<br/><br/>It sounds like it could be a good version of 'Pacific Rim' - and while it's cool to see the giant CGI monsters, you don't actually get to see enough action/battle scenes. The major failing is the characters - you spend an hour with Taylor-Johnson & his Dad (Cranston) before you even see Godzilla! Despite that, there's still very little character development and you just plain don't care what happens to them or the other human characters. It definitely needed more of Watanabe. Also, there's a ridiculous number of coincidences how Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass keeps showing up in the right/wrong place.<br/><br/>One of the major unexplained situations is where did Godzilla come from, and if they knew he existed, where has he been for 60 years? Hibernating on the ocean floor? And why does he want to battle the MUTO - for food? Apparently not! Therefore, what does he eat to sustain his giant bulk? The other major annoying thing for me was the stupidity of the humans - hey, these MUTO love nuclear energy, so let's try to destroy them with a nuclear weapon! Or they can emit electromagnetic pulses - let's keep flying planes & helicopters near them, surely they won't crash! Anyway, on a positive note, you do see some of Godzilla for the final 30min (but not enough) and he does, thankfully, have flame-breath."

","This movie was very disappointing. I am a fan of Godzilla and will tend to give anything with Godzilla in it more leeway than it deserves, and even still, I have to say this was not a good movie. I don't know what the bug-things were, but I was hoping for a classic character to be the antagonist. Godzilla was not in the movie much, which is sad because he is the main draw. His scenes were all dark and from odd angles, making it harder to enjoy what little screen time he received. I expect this was a artistic decision, but I disagree with it. In a movie like Cloverfield it works, but in a movie named Godzilla where everyone wants to see Godzilla, it does not work as well. This movie gets 4 stars because Godzilla was in it, and I like to see Godzilla. <br/><br/>One final point, which will likely render the rest of my review unreliable by... just about everyone. Bryan Cranston. There are people complaining that he did not get enough screen time, and they are correct, he is not the main focus. But my issue is... All I see is Malcolm's dad. I watched one season of Breaking Bad and stopped because it was so unrealistic for Malcolm's dad to be doing those things. Did no one else watch that show??? How is no one else having this problem???"

The absurdity is when the humans start shooting their machine guns at the monsters. You could use a pellet gun it would be the same. Just put the thing on fire and job's done. About the cast, the only decent actors with a name die within the first twenty minutes. So for the acting you don't have to watch Godzilla. For the story neither.

The action scenes happens mostly in darkness, and you can't discern much detail as to whats going on. It's like AVP 2 in this way. And to hang on it for 2 hours is rather a long ordeal.

","When the trailer for the 2014 'Godzilla' came out everyone was raving about it so I thought I'd better take a look (I don't usually watch trailers if I can help it). Admittedly it was a hell of a trailer but I remember thinking to myself there's no way the full 2 hour film can have this much intensity and excitement so it didn't seem like a true indication that it was going to be a great film. Sure enough I was right. An absolute snoozefest. The best scene in the movie made up most of the trailer and the rest was just filler.<br/><br/>For a movie called 'Godzilla' the titular character really doesn't get a lot of screen time. This would be OK if the characters weren't such a complete bore, not to mention incredibly unlikable. Bryan Cranston was the only character that could have carried this movie from start to finish, but instead we are left with Aaron Taylor-Johnson playing a spoilt, miserable brat. I never once thought to myself ""I hope this character survives the movie"", I simply couldn't have cared less about any of them for that matter. That is never a good thing in any movie of any kind.<br/><br/>The film relies heavily on being visually impressive. At times it is for sure. But is that enough to carry a film? No way. From what I understand 'Godzilla' movie after 'Godzilla' movie turn out to be flops and there's a very simply reason for this - the character is ultimately boring. Once you've had your first glimpse at him and maybe seen him roar once or twice there isn't a lot left to see. I see that two sequels have already been green lit. I bet right now there's a scriptwriter who's been handed the job of those thinking ""why me? It was a stretch making one movie out of this character, let alone two more"".

","I've never been a huge Godzilla fan myself. Just like with the another big cinema monster, King Kong, I can see the appeal, but the ""giant monster"" genre has never really been my cup of tea. So in that extent I have no means to tell if this particular movie is a travesty towards the ol' nuclear lizard.<br/><br/>In this new Godzilla, the lizard king itself is an ancient monster from the more radiated past of the Earth. As the radiation has cooled down Godzilla and its kind went to the deep ocean or in deep slumber inside the Earth. Until the day humans found atomic power. The human meddling with the atom causes parasitic giant creatures to submerge from their slumber and soon the world is suffering in the claws of the monstrous destruction, which goes even further when the ancient enemy of the monsters, King Kong arrives to whoop some ass.<br/><br/>While, just like every other disaster movie, Godzilla is trying to bring a human element to the story in the form of a father Joe (Bryan Cranston) a son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his family and a monster researcher Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), that human element is just as obsolete it is in any other disaster movie. The main course of the movie is the destruction the monsters can cause, the mayhem and the spectacle of it. And boy, does this movie do the spectacle well.<br/><br/>But as the human element is pretty much stock material for a movie like this, I couldn't help but to feel in many places that this Godzilla movie is just way too long. It uses a lot of time in order to convince that we should care about the humans, but just like in almost every disaster movie before this it is pretty hard to care about stock caricatures.<br/><br/>As far disaster movies go, I've seen much worse. But at the same time I can't really say this Godzilla has sparked my interest to go to the Japanese Godzilla's either. But at least it's better than that utterly horrible 1998 movie with Matthew Broderick, so I guess that's something at least."

","Godzilla (2014): Dir: Gareth Edwards / Cast: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche: The umpteenth movie about the classic reptilian monster that emerges from the seas and rampages through Tokyo and apparently San Francisco as well. It begins in 1954 where the disaster originally hit, accompanied with the Japanese version of the film. Then it juts ahead to 1999 where Bryan Cranston works at this facility and witnesses the loss of his wife. Years later his son has grown and has joined the Navy. He receives news that his father has been arrested in Tokyo. Cranston is the one effective casting and he is only in this film for the first twenty minutes or so. He informs his son of a cover-up but cannot quite pin point the issue. The rest of the cast loses the personality contest against the giant lizard. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was much more interesting in Kick-Ass. One could only wish he donned the costume and dashed out to fight the monsters. Elizabeth Olsen plays his nurse wife and her performances collapses faster than the buildings. Ken Watanabe is a decent actor subdued by cardboard writing. Juliette Binoche is seen briefly as Cranston's wife whose departure brings the one emotional front to the film. While the structure is just a series of disasters but the climax where Godzilla clashes with two winged creatures is strong stuff. While a better film than the pathetic 1998 version it is still subdued with idiot children separated from their parents and actors separated from decent material that remain more stable than the cities featured here.

Although the CGI was outstanding and Godzilla was (for most of his screen time) excellent I still felt that the ending was a major kick in the gut.

","The movieÂ… Well I gotta admit there are some really good things about this movie. First of all we have a good background story, which is based on the 1954 original and I applaud that. The filming of the scenes from the 1950's is made very well, and I enjoyed that part a lot.<br/><br/>Beside that we have a very good, albeit short, performance by Bryan Cranston who did a great job in the first 30 minutes. Too bad we didn't get a proper showdown with him and Godzilla as that would've been cool. Why couldn't he stay longer, perhaps shoot a bazooka at them and say : Yippe-Ki-Yay!<br/><br/>Now that would be some proper stuff. Besides Cranston's performance, Watanabe does a very good job also.<br/><br/>Another on my plus list is the Godzilla himself. He is really amazing and the way he roars! Very nice visual effects, I was really impressed! It would be also nice if Godzilla was the main character in his own movie too! More screen time also! Shame.<br/><br/>Okay, let's check out the negatives I've found.<br/><br/>First of all, Cranston's screen-time. Big no no. Also, Godzilla screen-time. I've come to watch Godzilla kick ass and roar. Not to see some MUTOs mate and lay eggs everywhere. If I wanted to watch weird people mating and laying eggs, I'd watch Jersey Shore or Big Brother.<br/><br/>The movie really drags out the showdown between Godzilla and the MUTO's. I was really looking forward to them beating seven shades of **** out of each other but every time they started fighting the scenes changed. Sure they were teasing because the main showdown needed to happen at the end. Was the main showdown any good then? It was mediocre at best, sadly. Sure we got some destruction and tail action but there wasn't enough of it for my taste. At least they brought back the atomic-breath from the original Godzilla. That was good.<br/><br/>I get why there was also so much heart tearing human interaction, but the human story doesn't pay off in the movie at all. I didn't feel connected to any of the actors, they didn't deliver the performance they should. It just felt like a drag, I kept wanting for them to sod off so I could see more of that bad ass Godzilla. At one point even, my friend who brought tuna with broccoli to the cinema (yes , he is weird like that), eating with a silverware fork, was also nagging about how they were boring him to tears. He at least had his broccoli.<br/><br/>Also the mistakes in the movie. Oh my, I must have counted more than 20 of them just at that one sitting. Can't wait for Cinema Sins to scour through this movie for a final count. I mean, seriously, a bus stops because a huge pole fell in front of it and then in the next shot after 3 seconds they just drive forward? The pole disappears? Also the A- bomb is set to explode in one hour during which our main actor runs across the entire San Francisco, jumps from an airplane, fights monsters and takes a stroll on a boat. That's a really long hour!<br/><br/>The ending. Why such an abrupt end? Godzilla just sways away into the sea? <br/><br/>Furthermore, don't bother yourself with the 3D version. Aside from some really nice scenery of the forest and helicopters flying around, I don't remember seeing anything that would stun me in 3D. I kinda even forgot I was looking at a movie made in 3D. Meh.<br/><br/>All in all I was not impressed by this movie at all. But because I really liked Godzilla's visuals, and there were some good things in the movie I'll rate this movie a 6/10."

Huge movie, massive special effects but really, really nothing. Nothing to remember, nothing to look on and say ""I really enjoyed that movie"" It's the new fast food but in entertainment form.<br/><br/>The thing that really disappointed me was that after, when I looked back on the script and the stylization and everything else I realized that I should have enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Script-wise: <br/><br/>A father sends his wife down to check out the reactor they are investigating. There is a melt down. The wife dies. It's his birthday. He spends the rest of his life trying to investigate the ""real"" cause. Their son looses both parents that day. That son grows up, a soldier, comes back from a year and a half duty. Hasn't seen his family that whole time and is instantly called away.<br/><br/>It's tear jerking. the script is fantastic. It's got all the emotional blackmail it needs.<br/><br/>Style:<br/><br/>I love the way they kept Godzilla in the Japanese style. I love the old footage. I love the way that Godzilla was not the ""Monster"" but the Balancing force. I love that look or recognition that the main character and Godzilla gave each other towards the end.<br/><br/>I should have loved this movie. This movie should be in my all time top 10. But I didn't. The script was run through as though it was simply a script. There was no emotion. They felt like they were touching on significant emotional points merely because they had to, because they were in the script. <br/><br/>An example of this is when the mother puts her child on the bus and stays behind. Really should have been a lot more tears between the two, a lot more crying. They may never see each other again. But no, apparently we're like cold heartless insects. (would have helped if the kid was cuter as well)<br/><br/>In the end something that should have been brilliant lacked any depth that it should have. I watched it and just did not care at all.<br/><br/>Also as an afterthought- there are all these scenes with soldiers investigating, searching through rooms. Invariably they come across the room they're searching for, open the door and half the room is gone. A big crater or something outside with helicopters flying around etc. Why the hell are they searching from room to room looking for something that they can quite obviously see before they even enter the building.<br/><br/>I normally would overlook this. But this movie really ticked me off. Something that had so much potential just flushed down the toilet.

","The movie had depth, range, and fight that had context. It was a fantastic job simply because they didn't just throw in monsters randomly killing Tokyo for the 100th time. Bryan Cranston set the tone for the movie for me because if something regarding family happens, you tend not to just forget it. The son being an army guy and having been part of a traumatic event was portrayed correctly psychologically. No he wasn't the most interesting, but they were accurate in his actions and behavior. The monsters were very well done. They didn't need a big name monster for this beginning of a new tale for Godzilla because they made a threat that was worthy of an ass whooping. The pay off was definitely at the end as crowds around the country stood up and cheered. That's a sign that everything before then meant something to lead up to that moment. Great job!"

","LOVED IT!! One of my best childhood memories was watching monster movies with my Dad on his old black and white TV in the back office (Mom did not want to hear it) of our house. It was our special thing-holed up in his dark, masculine office, munching homemade popcorn while being mildly terrified by various creatures and fiends, but Godzilla was my hands down favorite- he wasn't a warm fuzzy dude, but he fought with passion and he was misunderstood. What is great about Godzilla 2014 is that despite the high tech CG arsenal at his disposal, director, Gareth Edwards, with amazing restraint, created a pleasing retro vibe in tune with the original film and capitalized on the pathos and mystery that is the essence of Godzilla. Bryan Cranston is brilliant, as is Ken Watanabe. They are the human soul of this movie. Sentimentalism aside, I took my 14-year-old son to see Godzilla and he loved it too! He is in that Hollywood age demographic that Summer movies are designed for and like most kids his age, he is a tough sell-jaded by the CG, steroid pumped movies that have proliferated in recent years. Godzilla is a win-win- grownups, teens and kids will enjoy it."
"grapplefanmel","9","4","12","17 May 2014"," ""Destroy all Monsters!!"" Except Godzilla
","Being a massive fan of the old Japanese Godzilla films, I always have my heart in my mouth when another director has an attempt at updating everyone's favourite monster but I was very happy with Gareth Edward's slant on the theme. <br/><br/>Losing Cranston and Binoche as the two established actors in the cast, so early in the proceedings, was a bit of a blow, but the stars of the show are the monsters and the cgi is absolutely brilliant. With regard to the monsters, was I the only one to be surprised when the MUTO made their appearance? As in the original black and white films, Godzilla is the hero, there to see to the other monsters, and the fact that a battered and bruised Godzilla swims away at the end, leaves me with the hope that they may follow this with a sequel with new MUTO for Godzilla to fight.<br/><br/>In general terms, the acting isn't brilliant after the 'names' have taken their leave - the son (Taylor-Johnson) and his wife (Olsen) are very blank vessels, but in a way their role isn't to overshadow the monster action, so they fulfil the criteria. And the storyline is full of handy coincidences but it's not a film you need to over-think, it's a suspend the disbelief kind of a film. And have I mentioned how good the cgi is? Lol<br/><br/>Other reviewers have mentioned the film Pacific Rim, and that film quickly became one of my favourites. I even retain some fondness for the last Godzilla film - just don't tell anyone! Who can resist the combination of Jean Reno and Hank Azario? But this Godzilla is a far superior animal, and , even better - his face is incredibly similar to the original Godzilla's, these things matter!"
"yashvardhan","10","4","12","17 May 2014"," Best monster movie since Jurassic Park
","Godzilla So Hollywood tries their hand on Godzilla for second time. Will it be a hit this time unlike last time? Well unlike Ronald Emmerich helmed 1998 remake, which I haven't seen so far, this is the best monster movie made in Hollywood since Jurassic Park. In some parts it is even better and more creative than Jurassic Park. Only thing lacking is the humor and memorable character like Dr. Ian Malcolm or Dr. Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. But enough with the comparison, let 's talk about the film on its own. This movie is non-stop entertaining that's for sure. It is entertaining even when the scene does not involve monster fights and human drama. And main credit for this goes to Bryan Cranston(whom we said goodbye on TV last year as ""Walter White"" on incredible finale of equally incredible ""Breaking Bad"") and Ken Watanabe who steal every scene they are in as scientist due to their incredible acting despite the fact they are in supporting role. As for the leading characters played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen as husband and wife, they are okay in their performance, but are not convincing enough to be a parent of 5 year old, since they themselves look like a teenager. However when they are not together, they do their job decent enough to hold their scenes tight.<br/><br/>Enough about performance, let's talk about the action scenes. The fight scenes are pretty awesome. They would be one of best fight scenes you would see this year. Some of the monster-vs-monster fight can give competition to last year's Pacific Rim. Unlike some monsters in a PG-13 film, here monsters are really scary not only because of their looks (kudos to creature design department) but because the not so experienced director add enough build up, momentum ,unpredictability and thrill without any clichÃ©d jump scares, to make the atmosphere scary.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant technically. And by technically I do not mean just the special effects but the cinematography and sound effect. But most impressive thing is art direction. Here everything is not Grey or dark, which is the case in movie like these, but here each and everything looks beautiful, be it architecture of Japan or close up shots of insects(yes, insects!) which looks like they are from National Geographic Channel."
"spintongues","3","3","8","17 November 2014"," dim as filmmakers' brains
","Why do filmmakers love so much to shoot their new crap in the dark? Do they really think it will give more suspense to their crippled plots and non-existent intrigues? Or is it just to save money on props, make-up and SFX? The usual result, like in the new Godzilla, is totally unwatchable, with bits and pieces of misguided action badly glued together by stretches of some dark matter (probably filmmakers' brains). <br/><br/>The team seems to be proud of the fact that Godzilla is actually shown for only ten minutes in this over-two-hours-long movie, but there's nothing to be proud of. Let's be honest, in monster movies we want to see monsters, not your cardboard characters' contorted faces. They also seem to take some pride in the fact that their monsters are more realistic than the original ones (Â…someone from Toho saw him in the 1950s and ran back to the studio to make a movie about the creature and was trying their best to remember and draw itÂ… - I quote the trivia here). Come on. The man in his ridiculous rubber suit was far more terrifying than your digital creations that move like Lego transformers (and sound like ones, too). You sensed real madness and terror there.<br/><br/>To boot, the music is toxically bad. I really don't know how they still hire notorious M. Desplat to do soundtracks, honestly. <br/><br/>After watching it, my wife and I thought about writing a manual on how to make your own Godzilla movie at home. First, you have to crawl into some dark space with creepy acoustics, like into the cabinet under your kitchen sink. You have to have two graphic novels with you (different, preferably no relation to each other), a flashlight, and a small but resilient dog (or cat). Tie the flashlight to the dog (or cat). Turn it on. Start reading your graphic novels to each other at the top of your voices, showing panels to each other with no regard to their continuity, while kicking your dog (or cat) around the insides of the place with creepy acoustics you're in. It won't let the animal fall asleep and provide you with desired lighting effects. Don't hurt the animal, you'll need it for the sequel or the next franchise reboot.<br/><br/>The result will be the same, the radio show ""Dinosaurs in a Tunnel."""
"TheUltimateDestroyah","10","3","8","14 October 2014"," Best Movie of The Year
","*WARNING! THIS IS A SPOILER REVIEW*<br/><br/>Godzilla was probably the most anticipated film of 2014. I mean, it's been 10 years since the last Godzilla movie and it's Godzilla 60th anniversary.<br/><br/>Now, I'm gonna say this right now. If you love movies filled with action, this movie might not be for you. Godzilla doesn't appear until about 50 minutes into the film. However, that does not stop it from being a great movie. We have a lot of Super Hero movies and Transformer movies filled with action throughout the movie, however, Godzilla actually builds up to the action.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot is good for a monster movie. Joe Brody's wife dies due to a radiation leak in a nuclear power plant. 15 Years Later, their son, Ford Brody, is now an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (E.O.D.) officer. After returning home to his family, he finds out that Joe Brody was arrested for trespassing in the Quarantine Zone. He travels to Japan and bails Joe out of jail. Joe then convinces Ford to come with him to the Q Zone. They are caught and arrested and taken to the power plant. A huge chrysalis is now housed at the Power Plant. The creature, dubbed MUTO(Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) breaks out of the chrysalis, killing Joe Brody. Ford is transferred to Honolulu Hawaii. While Ford is on a train, the MUTO arrives in Honolulu. Godzilla arrives and they briefly fight. Later, a second MUTO is discovered. All 3 monster arrive in San Francisco and they fight. Godzilla kills both Mutos and roars in victory before collapsing. The next day, Godzilla awakens and roars one last time before returning to the ocean.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting was pretty good in this movie. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Elizabeth Olsen, and Bryan Cranston was outstanding as usual, however, he is killed during the first 40 minutes of the film. Aaron Taylor Johnson was alright, he's definitely better than some of the old actors from the Japanese movies. (Ozaki from Final Wars...)<br/><br/>Godzilla: Godzilla looks great! The CGI is excellent. I love his new roar, specifically the Airport Roar, the China Town Roar, and the Victory Roar. Godzilla basically looks like the classic Japanese version but in CGI form(thank god, 1998 was horrible). He has his atomic breath, but rather than the Heisei beam version, his breath is a lot more like the original 1954 film. I loved the part where he kills the female MUTO with his atomic breath, and then drops her head. Overall, this is definitely one of the best Godzilla designs.<br/><br/>MUTO: The MUTOs were pretty cool kaiju. They have a really cool roar. The male Muto has wings while the female one doesn't. The CGI is just as good as Godzilla, and they're great fighters. They have an EMP attack, which is definitely new. Also, they're NOT Mothra or Rodan or the Cloverfield Monster. The only resemblance they have to Mothra or Rodan are the wings, and only the male one has wings. Overall, they're some of the best kaiju in a Godzilla film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I do believe this is the best movie of the year. The movie actually builds up to the action, unlike most movies of today. It's also not a ""Action 24/7"" movie, which is nice because that's exactly what the Super Hero and Transformer movies are. Godzilla is easily one of the best movies of 2014.<br/><br/>Godzilla has been be King of the Monsters for 60 years now, this is definitely a great reboot to the Godzilla series. Gareth Edwards did a great job and so did everyone else who worked on the film. See you in 4 years Godzilla!<br/><br/>""Let Them Fight."""

","Quick synopsis: Bryan Cranston plays an engineer who figures out that the meltdown at the nuclear power plant where he works wasn't a nuclear meltdown. His theory is that the authorities are hiding something, but he doesn't know what.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, his son (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) plays a bomb disposal Navy man and finds out that the authorities were hiding monsters, and now they're awake and ready to attack.<br/><br/>This movie destroys the ideas of the original film, and I found that to be disturbing. The original Godzilla was a warning against nuclear war, but in this film, nuclear war is kind of besides the point.<br/><br/>Mr. Taylor-Johnson and Ms. Olsen don't react well to green screens and to each other. I thought they were both pretty wooden. The special effects were fine, but the story just dragged on without too much action. And the music was bombastic and there was a lot of ""catching"", where the music is aligned to the visuals too much.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this snooze fest."

","I write this review in regards to my opinion on the depth of this film, and the way this film was portrayed. I can say however that I didn't see the 2004 version. so my view is bias towards the other version. 1. Castings, Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), had a great part, but was it a similar role to ""Walt"" in Breaking Bad... hmmm , if you've seen Breaking Bad, you'll know what I mean. The rest of the ""main cast"", I wasn't really over impressed with and to me , seemed a film to kick start the remakes, or ""New angle on previous Titles, in the past 10-20 years. 2. Liked the angle on How Godzilla came about and how they kept you on the edge of your seat for more than 20 mins, but could they have done more? Yes. Was it believable ?, the idea behind Godzilla , yes, but as the film wares on , it gets abit ""been done before"". 3. Am I going to be rushing out to buy this on DVD or Blu ray? , personally no, but I was pleased ish , that I had seen this at the cinema. 4. How they captured a lot of ""action and disaster scenes, was quite impressive"", OK there is CGI but you come to expect that now in these big ""wanna be films"", its no where near to the quality of Jurassic Park, but did they want to be? 5. It was a good story at times , but would I have seen it if Bryan Cranston wasn't in it? Probably not. So on my above insight on this film I give this a 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>I enjoy my films and going to the Cinema for the ""Cinema experience"", but definitely wasn't a big film for me."

"zardoz-13","8","3","8","26 May 2014"," Breathes New Fire Into An Old Franchise
","Believe it or not, although the Japanese made their landmark monster movie ""Godzilla"" in 1954, Hollywood beat them to the punch with ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" Adapted from a Ray Bradbury short story published in ""The Saturday Evening Post"" magazine, ""Beast"" concerned a prodigious prehistoric amphibian awakened from hibernation by atomic bomb blasts. Wasting no time, the scaly leviathan wended its way to New York City where it wrecked havoc on a heretofore unparalleled scale. Even before ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms,"" Hollywood had made a 1925 silent-era movie ""The Lost World"" where a dinosaur on the loose rampaged through London. Anyway, about a year after ""Beast"" came out, the Japanese released ""Gojira,"" and the Toho Company went on to exploit its radioactive creature for every cent it was worth. Godzilla stomped Tokyo to smithereens, and the film proved so profitable that Hollywood reedited it to accommodate American actors and changed the title from ""Gojira"" to ""Godzilla."" Afterward, Hollywood entrusted the gigantic monster genre to the Japanese. Meantime, Toho has churned out at least 28 Godzilla epics over a 60-year period and coined millions at the box office with their man in a rubber suit. Eventually, rival Japanese studios produced Godzilla knock-offs; the chief example was the titanic turtle ""Gamera"" that breathed fire.<br/><br/>In 1998, ""Independence Day"" director Roland Emmerich helmed the first American ""Godzilla,"" but it took too many liberties with the Toho legend. First, Big G lost his incendiary breath. Second, Big G resembled a Komodo dragon. Comparably, ""Godzilla"" (1998) sold only half as many tickets during its opening weekend as ""Monster"" British director Gareth Edwards' ambitious, second American reboot of Big G. Unlike Emmerich's ""Godzilla"" that synthesized spectacle and slapstick, Edwards and ""Seventh Son"" scenarist Max Borenstein have shunned humor in favor of catastrophe. The new ""Godzilla"" doesn't involve lame-brained amateurs, but grim-faced scientific and military types. Indeed, this ""Godzilla"" treats the Toho icon with genuine respect and dignity. This time around Godzilla isn't searching for someplace to lay its eggs. Instead, Big G has embarked on its own crusade to defend mankind and thwart a couple of nuclear-age behemoths that want to lay their eggs in San Francisco. Ironically, Big G wins the battle of the monsters, but he doesn't garner as much stomp time as he did in Emmerich's ""Godzilla."" You'll have to wait patiently about an hour for Big G to show up. Nevertheless, Godzilla makes a dramatic entrance, and he dominates the action for the last half-hour. Edwards' straight-forward version of ""Godzilla"" eclipses Emmerich's comic version.<br/><br/>Most of the amusing ""Godzilla"" movies from the 1960s & 1970s pitted Big G against two enemies, and the new ""Godzilla"" adopts the scenario of the outnumbered hero. The battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are thoroughly invigorating. Unfortunately, the two biggest drawbacks to Edwards' largely entertaining ""Godzilla"" are its dreary, one-dimensional humans who clutter up the action and the bland MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) monsters that resemble gargantuan mosquitoes that walk on their knuckles like gorillas. A cast of familiar faces cannot compensate for their sketchy characters. Mankind isn't half as interesting as Godzilla, especially when he tangles with the MUTOs in a world class smack-down brawl. Ironically, Big G appears to get the short shrift. ""Godzilla"" isn't so much about the monsters as the spectacular collateral damage that Godzilla and two airborne giants wreck on mankind. The destruction, or perhaps urban renewal, matches the wholesale mayhem of the ""Transformers"" trilogy and Marvel's ""The Avengers."" Traditionally, filmmakers have employed Godzilla as allegory for the appalling consequences mankind has paid for tampering with our environment. Essentially, Godzilla has always been the cultural embodiment of global warming.<br/><br/>The action unfolds in 1954 when the military detonates atomic devices at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in a futile effort to destroy Godzilla. We catch a glimpse of Big-G's heavily spiked back emerging from the depths as the explosions erupt. Later, a nuclear power plant in Japan collapses, and the radioactive ruins become the equivalent of Area 51. Janjira Plant Supervisor Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston of ""Drive"") watches in horror as his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche of ""The English Patient"") dies when the reactor blows up. Afterward, the government quarantines the collapsed plant, but Brody suspects the government is orchestrating a cover-up. Meantime, Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Savages"") grows up, joins the Navy, and specializes in explosive ordnance disposal. He marries Elle (Elizabeth Olsen of ""Oldboy"") who works as nurse in San Francisco. Naturally, they have a son Sam (Carson Bolde). Fifteen years after the Janjira disaster, Joe hasn't recanted his crazy theories about a cover-up. The authorities arrest him for trespassing in his old home in the quarantine zone. They escort him to meet two scientists, Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Graham (Sally Hawkins), who have established a secret facility within the Janjira ruins. All hell breaks loose a second time, and a colossal, winged reptile materializes.<br/><br/>The last thing director Gareth Edwards had on his mind for his ""Godzilla"" reboot was levity. Not only does he want us to take Godzilla seriously as a monster, but he also wants us to take the movie ""Godzilla"" seriously. The new ""Godzilla"" shares little in common with the-man-in-a-rubber-suit ""Godzilla"" franchise. If you haven't seen either ""Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla"" (1994) or ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" (1973), you haven't seen some of the best ""Godzilla"" entries that challenge your suspension of disbelief. Edwards draws on Steven Spielberg's movies ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of a Third Kind"" as models for both the presentation and the pacing of his impressive two hour plus CGI monstrosity. The visual effects make everything appear believable. The spectacle of destruction in Japan, Hawaii, Las Vegas and San Francisco is stunning. Altogether, Edward's ""Godzilla"" breathes new fire into a old franchise."

","Remember Pompeii from earlier this year? No one does: Most people didn't see it, and those that did left sorely disappointed. All we wanted was big disaster actionÂ…is that so much to ask?! Fret no longer, Godzilla is here to fill that monster-sized hole at the theatre, roaring past expectations. Possessing impressive and unique action scenes, gorgeous visuals and compelling humanity, it's a conspiracy theory drama that pumps adrenaline, reminding why Godzilla is such a revered creation. The story is nothing new: humans wake up monster(s), monsters destroy civilization, humans must deal with consequences on macro and micro levels. There are the ubiquitous exposition scenes, a handful of one-dimensional characters, some corny dialogue, and a few too many coincidences. Mostly though, there is an enormous amount of care and skill in every shot. The cinematography is the best of the year so far; beautifully dark and meticulously framed. Moreover, I can't remember the last time a movie was so flourishingly consistent in showing its gigantic scope, never leaving the audience behind, and always placing us smack in the middle of the terror. Nonetheless, within the huge scale, the personal stakes of the characters is present and successful Edwards clearly studied the best of Spielberg in his handling of the monsters and their human counterparts, all the while presenting a truly singular auteur vision. The pacing is patient but not boring, the story is familiar but not ordinary, and Godzilla himself is just plain cool. This is creature-feature movie making at its finest, and will wipe away the tainted memory of the 90's Matthew Broderick GodzillaÂ…yikes."
"ChrisChadwick","3","3","8","24 May 2014"," Directed by a 3 yr old
","Gareth Edwards? Who's that? Is what you'll be hearing in two or three years time, hopefully. It's hard to do, but Godzilla is a summer blockbuster that is even worse, and even more of a disappointment than Man of Steel. The direction throughout was that of a man who'd seen other films and 'tried to do THAT'. He failed. As soon as I saw Juliette Binoche put on the radiation suit, I thought to myself 'so this is where the father and son will be getting their motivation for the movie'. Fast forward 15 years and this *was* exactly where Walter White got his motivation... until he was far too prematurely written out of the script. They got rid of the only good thing about the film! But they didn't even give him a memorable death. They just fizzled him out. No pathos. No emotion. All we got was a very indifferent: ""Dad's gone"" on an emotionless voice-mail sign off. And now we come to the worst element in the film: Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who, for some strange reason I'm sure only known to himself, decided to do an acting impersonation of another none-entity actor: 'Milo Ventimiglia'. Compare their acting style. You'll see I'm right. I didn't know that Aaron Taylor-Johnson couldn't act before this film... but now I do. Previously, I'd just seen him turn up for Kick-Ass and do some acting in front of a camera... I think. Here though- and I have no idea why he chose Milo Ventimiglia as his acting inspiration- he manages to go through the whole film without once troubling his emotion chip. He was awful. One tone the whole way through, regardless of the situation. You see your dad- no emotion. You see a gigantic monster- no emotion. Your wife is in peril- NO EMOTION! Speaking of his wife, Elizabeth Olsen was good (for the limited time she was on the screen). The kid was completely superfluous to the script. Bryan Cranston, as brilliant and talented as he is, seemed to come straight from the set of Breaking Bad carrying on his portrayal of Walter White. He's a magnetic screen presence though and as soon as the camera went away from him, you just wanted it to get back as soon as possible (especially when it cut away to scenes of the bulked up Milo Taylor- Johnson). But even he- EVEN HE- was a disappointment. He was just Walter White. Again. Determined, driven and not averse to breaking the rules. The monsters were good (I suppose): The Cloverfields were all right. The Godzilla was okay. It was incredibly frustrating though when we find out that thermonuclear blasts don't kill the life-forms (pretty early on in the film), and yet the soldiers carry on firing guns at them. Why? I mean- why? As for the film, there were more clichÃ©s than a Stephanie Meyer novel, which I found incredibly exasperating. We could see what was coming way before the director did, it seemed. Subway train comes off tracks; splits open at the end; dangles precariously; screaming passengers slide out; Milo Ventimiglia stops himself from falling; but what's this? There's also a lost child he's been protecting somewhere in the carriage? Oh no, there he is- he's sliding down and--- yep, Milo has caught him. Phew! About a minute before this though, one of the Cloverfields turned up causing the carriage full of fleeing citizens to go absolutely nuts. All apart from Aaron Taylor-Miglia. He looks at the gigantic behemoth and, well, just sort of looks at it. ""And cut. Thanks for the great acting... how much did we pay him, again?"" I found it frustrating that as soon as the action started with the monsters, the director cut away to something mundane. No! Don't cut away! We want to see some action! The multi-skydive scene was Reign of Fire accompanied by the eerie, insistent choir song from 2001: A Space Odyssey. So, to sum up: Juliette Binoche- obvious outcome. Bryan Cranston- not enough (but too much Walter White already). Milo Ventimiglia- ""paging Milo Ventimiglia!"" Elizabeth Olsen- not enough. Kid- please return to dressing room. You're not needed. David Strathairn- why did they do that big reveal at the beginning? It's only David Strathairn. Ken Watanabe- Believable. Ken Watanabe's assistant- 'not' believable. Then, at the end, why do they cry about Godzilla? Yes, he killed the Cloverfields, but he still probably crushed hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people. And who's to say he won't be back when he gets a rumble in his tummy? And if I hear the words 'It is man's arrogance...' one more time, I swear I'm going to resort to violence. In conclusion- I was so, so let down. This could've been so much more. But it wasn't. It was just rubbish."

","This film is as realistic as any movie could be when showing the story of enormous monsters battling against each other that threaten human existence. A reboot of the Godzilla film franchise which meets the 'terrifying force of nature' phrase. It stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a calm and collective soldier who is also known for trying to kick ass in the movie Kick Ass, who stars alongside the beautiful Elizabeth Olsen and the wonderful legend Bryan Cranston who portrays a nuclear physicist who is determined to find out the truth behind the nuclear tests in the Pacific so that he can justify the death of his wife.<br/><br/>The film takes on a more serious image than the last version in 1998 directed by Roland Emmerich. The opening credits to the movie of Nuclear tests in the Pacific during the 1950's, give us the stereotypical view on the government which is how secretive they can be and how they can use the excuses of natural disasters like earthquakes when they need to cover up their mess. When the monster is unleashed, the whole world is under the threat and forces must come together to fight as one.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good action packed film but also the malevolent and brilliant special effects especially the legendary king with the loudest roar of all times. It's a pure 123 minutes of good filming and talented acting qualities that bring this movie together to reboot the originals. It's a more realistic approach to the story and it's unquestionably worth a trip to the cinema to watch or to pick up in the store, even if you only take a trip to get a quick glance at our favourite legendary monster, but I guarantee you that it is worth the run"

","Basically take 2 or 3 fight scenes from the Pacific Rim, and add a LOT of family-rescue melodrama - that's it. Godzilla 2014. The scene where actor takes his gas mask off, smells the air and says ""I KNEW! There's no radiation!"" is SO pathetic...you cannot smell radiation or somehow feel it. You will just die after a certain period of time (a week.. a month..). This is the main hazard of it - inability to sense its presence without special hardware. (I guess every schoolboy knows it) I surprised this movie earns so many stars here. For what? Rendered monsters and ruined buildings are nothing new, and there's no mechanic fun that is so profound in the Rim. Resemblance to old Godzilla? Well this could be the only reason."
"numptyur","9","3","8","22 May 2014"," A Godzilla reboot made for Godzilla fans
","I loved this movie. Yes it has some flaws but the positives far out weight the negatives. Without giving away spoilers I'll say the biggest negative and the only one that kept this movie from being a 10 for me is that Bryan Cranston isn't the star of the movie. He has a smaller supporting role and the movie is mainly carried by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Johnson's character has very little emotion, though I believe that was by design as he seems to bury his emotions after suffering through a tragic event. The movie really needed that strong emotional component Cranston brings to the beginning of the film for the entire movie. I liked the Contrast Cranston and Johnson had at the beginning seeing how each has dealt with their shared traumatic event and would have loved to seen that carried through to the end. The other negative that didn't bother me too much was I wanted a little more Godzilla. With that being said, every time he is on screen it's money shot after money shot. Even though Godzilla wasn't on screen for a ton of the movie the Director did a great job of making you still feel his presence and the Muto creatures don't disappoint getting you to Godzilla. You feel throughout the movie that a giant prehistoric beast is lurking out there somewhere. That leads me to what I loved about this movie. The directing was superb. There are so many amazing shots in this movie. The HALO jump was incredible, the bridge scene was brilliantly shot, and the final battle was amazing and contains the best fatality ever on film. I loved where Edwards placed the camera in this movie, it really gave scale to the giant creatures in this movie. With the sequel announced I'm excited to see how this Godzilla universe gets expanded. Great summer blockbuster, go check it out"

","I'm an absolute Godzilla nerd since I've been a child. I never got into much of anything else comic/movie wise so I'm a little bias. I thought the movie was very good. Godzilla looked amazing & I like they took a serious approach to the movie. However, there were a few things that I couldn't overlook that bothered me. I know I'm prob. Being picky but... 1st Godzillas atomic breath wasn't as powerful as it shouldve been. The initial one looked amazing but it hardly hurt the smaller muto, just pushed it back. With the breath building up beautifully the way it did, and him puffing his chest etc. It shouldve blew that muto through a few buildings at least, or killed it/put a hole in it. Also if it weren't for distractions it appeared Godzilla would've been killed. I think he shouldve been stronger VS. The Mutos. I just didn't feel satisfied that he beat them up.. it was more he got lucky. I know it was 2 v 1 but, as a Godzilla nerd he appeared slightly weaker than most Godzilla fans would've liked to see.<br/><br/>Loved the movie overall though. Can't wait for 2nd!!!"

Aaron Taylor Johnson does a great job at showing how a man will do anything to fight for his country and Bryan Cranston with a short role does a lot.. he should've been given more screen time. **SPOILER ALERT** What really moved me was Godzilla's character and it showed that there is such a thing as good monsters.Sound and visual effects were out of this world..

","I just finished watching this, so I'm still reveling in the excitement from it, but I'll say it; Best film of the year, so far! Guillermo del Toro, if you ever want to make a monster film again, take note; This is how you make one! Before seeing this film, I heard a reviewer saying that the monsters scenes were all cut short, and after watching the film I know what they meant, but I don't agree it took away from the excitement or action of the film. I felt it was done on purpose to give you the final payoff of showing the entire final fight at the end, which made it much more special and exciting. Like Spielberg did with JAWS, though it wasn't planned that way at the time, less is more for edge of your seat films such as this.

It looked absolutely amazing and I would definitely go to see it again, especially in IMAX 3D. Absolutely stunning. *SPOILER*. I was a little disappointed by the last 5 minutes because I think it would have been more gripping had Godzilla had died, but that most certainly isn't enough for me to give this movie any less than the 10/10 it deserves.

"japamo","10","3","8","20 May 2014"," Finally, Finally, FINALLY! A Godzilla (and Godzilla Movie) to Be Proud Of!
","As I have written in my Amazon.com review of ""Pacific Rim"", I had always keenly wished for a mega-million, state-of-the-art, blockbuster treatment of the legendary lizard. And boy, is this 2014 spectacular rendition of ""Godzilla"" ever IT! To put it succinctly, I think Gareth Edwards and company succeeded in rescuing Godzilla from the emasculating abyss of chintzy camp and restoring him to his mighty symbolic status as not only a nuclear, near-supernatural, vengeful force of nature, but also, ironically enough, of natural, balanced harmony.<br/><br/>In other words ""Godzilla 2014"" first pays respectful, meticulous homage to the 1954 (cult) classic and then expands the lizard's mythic status. As in the original, to the likely dismay of attention-deficit sufferers, Godzilla wisely doesn't pop onto the screen full-blown right away. At the beginning of the film, we merely get a sepia-toned photographic glimpse of his scaly back towering above the waves as the product of World War II nuclear deployment. We soon move forward to an apparent nuclear accident at the Janjira nuclear plant where nuclear physicist and engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) works. Like in at least some Toho Godzilla productions, Joe assumes the role of the ""Cassandra scientist"", which is a scientist who really knows what's going on, but can't convince other, skeptical scientists, government officials, or anyone else of the truth until it's too late.<br/><br/>Yes, the plant does emit nuclear radiation, enough to claim the lives of several radiation specialists, including Joe's nobly self-sacrificing wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) who fiercely urges the tearful Joe to seal the breach so that the contamination doesn't spread. At first, plant officials seem merely to want to cover-up a run-of-the mill nuclear disaster. But Joe eventually convinces his initially disbelieving son Navy Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that something even more threatening is looming. The power-plant radius has no lethal radiation whatsoever. Also, during the accident, Joe picks up electromagnetic pulses of biological origin, almost as if two creatures are communicating. As the movie ominously and deliberately progresses, the monstrously REAL truth literally comes out. Within the quarantined plant, some weird cocoon has absorbed the ambient nuclear energy. It eventually hatches and a tremendous ""Alien""-like/praying mantis-like insectoid thing goes on its destructive march - and flight (it has wings). With the knowledgeable help of Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), who seems to know a lot about these monster matters, the U.S. military eventually determines that the big bug male is flying toward a rendezvous with its wingless mate, which was incubating thousands of larva at a nuclear waste containment facility in Nevada. She breaks out impressively as well.<br/><br/>Okay, it's time for Godzilla to show up, and when he does, people, honest to goodness, I was just overwhelmed! Magnificent! He intercepts the winged male in Honolulu for a relatively brief but devastating tussle. The winged male escapes somehow and continues toward his rendezvous. The military determines that the three ""things"" will converge in San Francisco where at least a contained nuclear detonation in San Francisco harbor should take care of all three, right. But as Dr. Serizawa reminds them, these creatures thrive on nuclear energy (even though the blast itself MAY kill them). Furthermore, he says that it is just possible that the lizard monster is mankind's only hope for salvation and that it may be better to just ""let them fight."" Oh boy, do they ever fight! The humans somewhat predictably recede a little into the background, although Ford resourcefully and heroically does his best to evacuate San Francisco, discover and destroy the insectoids' brood, help detonate the nuclear missile, and return to his family. We may have had to wade through some exposition, mystery, and set-up to get to the battle royal, but I think it was certainly worth the wait. There's no 1998 ""Zilla"" here. Godzilla's got all the goods, and he'll need them, because the insectoids are both formidable, ferocious enemies. What's the outcome? I heartily suggest you see this for yourself.<br/><br/>""Godzilla 2014"" through its measured, solemn, deliberate pace re-establishes the ""Lizard King"". It's an infinitely satisfying monster mash, to be sure, but it also manages to allude to mankind's destructive tendencies and its presumption to tame nature, rather than realize that it is at nature's whim, as Dr. Serizawa comments. And it even suggests that while Godzilla seems to side with the humans, that could be a tenuous alliance. Toho, Godzilla, ""Pacific Rim"", and monster movie fans should gobble up ""Godzilla 2014"". Others, like my Amazon.com friend and prolific reviewer Andrew Ellington may understandably and reasonably dismiss it as crazy, stupid fun, as he did in his ""Pacific Rim"" review. Nevertheless, for its genre, Godzilla is INTELLIGENT, rational, crazy, stupid fun!"

","When this film was first mentioned a couple of years ago, I was a concerned that the history of this iconic creation would again be sullied as it was in the 1998 travesty. Being a fan of the original Toho films of the fifties and sixties I never thought that any modern version would come close to the enjoyment of those flicks.<br/><br/>How wrong I was. This film is a joy from start to finish. <br/><br/>Now I know that some people have written that there isn't enough Godzilla in this movie. It is fair to say that the MUTO's get more screen time, and much of the film is spent with the human side of what is taking place. I have to say though that this sits fine with me. This is a film which believes in taking its time, setting the scene and delivers with a big payoff at the end. This was a proper film with a beginning, middle and end. You find yourself engrossed in the story, knowing that the big guy will unleash himself when the film is ready for it. To me this works far better than just having some two hours of monsters mashing each other like a Transformers film.<br/><br/>My favourite film of the year so far, and one that will probably take some topping ( though I have a strong inkling that Guardians of the Galaxy will manage that )"
"stopcampingnb","10","3","8","19 May 2014"," A monster movie done right, for monster fans.
","Godzilla's epic retelling of him surfacing to fight is not a new idea. This at least happened 3 times conducted by studios Sony TriStar and Toho Ltd. Co.<br/><br/>This time, it was the most suspenseful one out of the handful. It had great story telling through multiple ways which I cannot spoil. If you like to see a movie with a similar style to the Dark Knight Rises or Contagion, you will love this film. It's pacing was very similar to the first Jaws. But, if you want a Michael Bay Transformers or Guilmere Del Toro's Pacific Rim. You might just be disappointed in the lack of action scenes and missed opportunities for the said, anticipated scenes. <br/><br/>The good: The camera work was amazing. It had a variety of shots and transitions like a James Camero film. The sound of the music, and the FX were spot on. The tone of the movie was serious, and you would feel like you are on an Earth where this is really happening, and you would be sitting at home watching the news report om it 24/7. Unlike then 1998 Godzilla, this one captured your emotions. Something a monster/kaiju movie rarely does. In conclusion,an epic CGI movie with more than CGI.<br/><br/>The ugly and SPOILERS: The Las Vegas and the Hawaii scenes were disappointing, to an extent. You just can't have a shot pulling away from the best parts of the second act. They have teased enough, that was an overdose of teasing. They did cover up to it at an extent with the 3rd act. A long battle between the gargantuan creatures hit one of the best climax's I have seen this year. <br/><br/>The movie is a Godzilla or monster movies fan's dream, but an action movie fan's simply nice (not extravagant) movie.<br/><br/>*This is my first review, I'm pleased to be a part of the IMDb community*"

Indeed, CGI & sound effects are truly amazing, and ""massive"" (that is the good word), and no one will argue on that. Furthermore, all these shots featuring visual and sound effects are very well done by Gareth Edwards, however most of audiences were tired of hearing autobots sound or pacific rim. Yes, some will complain about his screen time, because they expected to see something similar to Godzilla 1, but no, it is never like it! <br/><br/>Edwards had the opportunity to put in place his own directing, and even though some parts of the movie are slowing it down (thinking about classic blockbusters scenes introducing a conventional plot or military quarters scenes), the movie remains original, epic, and boring since humans are not really our heroes on this one."

"paul-heys-im","3","3","8","19 May 2014"," Godzilla, Alpha Predator, or Neutered Puppy?
","Spoilers! <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Godzilla. So you can understand my excitement was at fever pitch for this new American iteration of a beloved monster icon. Undoubtedly, I haven't been this excited to see a Godzilla film since the 1998 version, and undoubtedly, I haven't been as disappointed as I am today having watched Gareth Edwards Godzilla.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the opening montage really does set the scene for this movie, but not in a good way. In the montage, there is a clip of Godzilla, rising up out of the sea, just as you are about to see the money shot, and the camera focuses in on what we paid to see, it cuts away to something far less interesting. The majority of the shots on Godzilla, what you laid out your 20 bucks for, end after 30 seconds, with instant cuts to army guys, army guys running, army guys talking, army guys looking befuddled at how in the hell they ended up getting this dire gig.....<br/><br/>The movie plays like a military propaganda film, with even a martial law scene in the first act. Oh look, the Americans are taking over, God(zilla) bless amurrika!<br/><br/>When the behemoth Godzilla finally does make his first appearance, it's the shot from the trailer, so by now, not a single person who went to see this film will have been tantalised because, well, because, we have all watched the trailer 20 times, a day, at least. so the arrival of Godzilla is the most underwhelming entrance of the big guy in all his cinematic history. I'm not being harsh, just truthful. The build up and reveal of Godzilla in the 1998 film was more satisfactory. And just as you are about to get that final, fleshed out look at Godzilla, what happens? They cut to a shot of a child eating his supper, or some other even more mundane pap. You see Godzilla a maximum of three times, the third time being a sort of extended cameo for the final scenes. The second time you see him, the Mutos is on screen too, and it looks like they are heading towards a showdown, cut to kid eating his supper, ""Look mum, dinosaurs"" Mum looks out of window.....Cut to static image of destroyed city, after the Non Existent Fight 1. That's how the rest of this film plays out. Every time it starts to focus on the interesting characters, the monsters themselves, they cut away to something far less interesting. <br/><br/>But Godzilla looks good, right? He looks like they spent 160 million dollars on him? Well, yes, sort of. And by that I mean, he looks like Godzilla, for the brief time you actually get to see him in daylight. The extended cameo scene takes place at night, obscuring most of what's going on, I know, they spent 160 million on great FX you can't actually see. Go figure. But in my opinion, there is nothing special about the Godzilla on display here. Sure they have captured his likeness, but really, it's just what you'd expect, no more. Godzilla in this film is not your charming, brimming with personality hero dinosaur from the classic films, here, he can be best described as ""generic"". And does he deliver in his scenes? Frankly, no. He is portrayed as a puppy dog, ally to America, wouldn't hurt a fly, never damages a building (at least on screen) the titanic saurian who is indestructible, now gets puffed out after using his mediocre looking, atomic breath. Is the old guy getting on? His iconic roar, in this Americanised Godzilla, sounds weak, by which I mean, Godzilla sounds wounded when he roars, even before any of the (off screen) fights take place. The Broderick Godzilla at least got the mighty battle cry of Godzilla, right. Which leads me to the climax of the film, a much hailed ""work of art"" Godzilla finally getting his hands on the enemy, and destroying the Mutos. <br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer.........You've seen it. Save your money. Re-watch the trailer. The final fight, as mentioned, takes place at night, interspersed with multitudes of camera cuts to Johnson, when you can see what is transpiring on screen, it's OK, but, the fight is dull. Essentially, Mutos lands a few blows, Godzilla goes for the kill shot with the atomic breath, then collapses, resting. The second Mutos rumbles over, cut to Johnson, cut back to Godzilla grabbing the final Mutos and blasting it with his atomic breath. Then cut to Johnson, laying alongside Godzilla, resting. This film is full of moments like that, humanising Godzilla, on the few moments you can actually see him. <br/><br/>But what about the city stomping? Surely there is some??? Well, yes, one island gets flooded, but really, all you see is Godzilla rising up, cut to tidal wave going through city, cut to mum, or army guy looking befuddled. There is hardly any disaster porn in this film, if that's what you were expecting to see. A few shots of the aftermath though, but wonder, where did they spend the 160 million dollars, because it certainly wasn't on the FX. Maybe they spent that much on retaining Bryan Cranston's services. <br/><br/>I think the amount of time Godzilla spends on screen in this new version have been exaggerated. Some sites are saying he's on there for 27 minutes, the same as the original, but I doubt that. It's more like 15 minutes, tops. <br/><br/>Bad film, worse Godzilla film."

Bryan Cranston seemed to be the only one to put a lot of effort into acting in this movie, but he dies 20 minutes into the movie, which is not a good mix. The only positive input in this movie is the graphics are amazing. Very good detail on the monsters. However, my advise would be to go see a different movie besides this disappointment.

"dee.reid","10","3","8","18 May 2014"," ""Godzilla"" (2014) - The King is Definitely Back (and he's definitely still taking names)!
","<ul><li>""...'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds...'"" - J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), in a 1965 television broadcast recalling his witnessing of the Trinity test in Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945</li></ul><br/><br/>First, some perspective.<br/><br/>For years, I've been against yet another attempt of an American ""Godzilla"" film, ever since I first heard that Hollywood was making one. Put simply, the first American attempt at a ""Godzilla"" film, ""Godzilla"" (1998), was a disaster, yet I saw it six times in the theater. Of course, I was but 12 at the time and was just hyped to finally see Godzilla lay waste to the United States.<br/><br/>But then reality (and age) set in and I realized what a god-awful mess that movie was. The Japanese already had their eyes set on reviving the mighty King of the Monsters for a third movie series with ""Godzilla 2000"" (1999), while he lay in a state of disarray here in the United States. During that time, other giant monster features have made a splash here; the first was South Korea's ""The Host"" in 2006, followed by the J.J. Abrams-produced ""Cloverfield"" in 2008, and then Mexican director Guillermo del Toro gosh-wowed (most of) us with ""Pacific Rim"" (2013) - which was, quite frankly, the best of the bunch - last year.<br/><br/>So giant monster movies have seen an increase in popularity (and legitimacy) here in the U.S. over the last seven years. So, what better way to capitalize on that increased popularity and legitimacy than to once again go back to the one giant beast (or ""kaiju"" - the Japanese word for ""strange monster"" or ""beast"") that started it all in the first place, Gojira (Godzilla).<br/><br/>To put it simply, Ishiro Honda's dark & gloomy, black & white ""Gojira"" (1954) is the single greatest monster movie ever made; yes, it's better than ""King Kong"" (1933) - there, I said it. I've been the biggest devotee - that I know of - of Japanese ""kaiju-eiga"" (Japanese giant monster movies) for much of my life; Godzilla, obviously, was the most famous of them all (Hollywood confirmed it themselves by giving him a star on the Walk of Fame 10 years ago to mark his 50th anniversary). Of course, that darkness and gloominess didn't last long, as Godzilla (originally a living manifestation of the atomic bomb and nuclear warfare) was eventually reworked into a superhero throughout the rest of the first-generation Showa-Era films - only returning to his roots as a rampaging menace in 1984 with the second-generation Heisei-Era films, beginning with ""Godzilla 1985"" (1984).<br/><br/>Now, Britain's Gareth Edwards has completely dazzled us with 2014's ""Godzilla."" I knew this movie was working when at a pivotal moment late in the third act when Godzilla (brilliantly motion-captured here by Andy Serkis) - now slightly re-worked here to appear literally as a force of nature - appears to lay waste to human civilization, over half the theater erupted in applause (myself included amongst them). In short, this is the ""Godzilla"" movie we've all been waiting for since the original ""Gojira.""<br/><br/>While this is nowhere near the greatness of ""Gojira,"" it's definitely not the '98 ""Godzilla."" This film contains much of ""Gojira's"" gloominess and growing atmosphere of imminent apocalyptic doom from the beginning, and that's a good thing. The picture begins in 1999 in The Philippines, where Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe, whose character's name is an obvious reference to both the late Ishiro Honda and the doomed scientist from ""Gojira,"" Dr. Serizawa, played there by the late Akihiko Hirata) and his assistant Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) have discovered the remains of an enormous prehistoric creature in an underground cavern. Things then shift to Japan, where American nuclear engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is at war with the corporate owners of a nuclear power plant in Janjira to shut it down over growing safety concerns and soon enough, tragedy strikes, losing his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) in the process.<br/><br/>15 years later, Joe has become a paranoid conspiracy theorist and virtual recluse, convinced that the Japanese government covered up what really happened at the plant and is desperate to get answers. His son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), now a family man himself, has just returned from active military duty overseas to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son Sam (Carlson Borde), and soon joins his father where they make a terrifying discovery.<br/><br/>It turns out that a previously unknown species of large prehistoric creatures (which vaguely resemble the monster from ""Cloverfield,"" crossed with a praying mantis) - called here as MUTOs (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"") - that feeds off radioactive materials has been awakened from an eons-long slumber and is now ready to lay waste to all of human civilization. In turn, the MUTOs are also being hunted by an even larger stone-age monstrosity, and you can pretty much guess who that is, if you haven't figured it out already...<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" has the usual epic destruction, monster-vs.-military firefights, and monster-on-monster smack-downs that have long characterized the monster-on-the-rampage movie genre. The only downside to the experience can be all the 9/11-styled imagery that's present (in addition to scattered references to Chernobyl, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster), which could rub some viewers the wrong way and possibly incite calls of ""bad taste.""<br/><br/>This is one ""Godzilla"" devotee who was once a doubter, went into the theater hyped and came out eagerly a believer, and REALLY eager for an even bigger sequel (and possible future franchise cross-over with ""Pacific Rim,"" which Legendary Pictures also produced)...<br/><br/>10/10"
"Meven_Stoffat","9","3","8","18 May 2014"," History shows again and again how nature points up at the folly of men
","This film is the closest to perfection any Godzilla movie has been since 1954. That's a bold statement, but it's true. It's everything you want in a Godzilla movie, and everything you don't know you want, too. I've seen the movie twice as of writing, and I can tell you it's stayed with me since.<br/><br/>The film is already impressive off the bat with the opening titles. The opening titles are similar to the 1998 movie, with the titles being shown over footage of nuclear tests, but they're done way better here. We're shown old newsreel footage, and every credit is shown in paragraphs, designed to look like they're ripped straight from scientific reports. The non-credit parts are suddenly whited-out to show the ""DIRECTED BY GARETH EDWARDS"" type stuff. Alexandre Desplat's score is just magnificent. In fact, the score is very nostalgic throughout, with some influence taken from classic blockbusters and even Bernard Herrman's Hitchcock scores, with even a dash of Cliff Martinez. <br/><br/>The bulk of the film follows Ford Brody. Much of the first half deals with his complicated relationship with his father Joe (Bryan Cranston)- near the beginning of the film, we see the tragedy that has estranged them both- they lived in Japan in 1999, when Ford 12 years old. At the Janjira power plant in Janjira, something of a large earthquake happens which causes a radiation burst, causing Joe to lose his wife (Juliette Binoche) in the disaster. Fifteen years later, Ford is an EOD in the American military. the very night he arrives home from service, he gets a call from officials, telling him that Joe was arrested. So he heads to Japan to sort things out with his dad, who reveals that he was in the area where their house was, to get floppy discs containing data about the disaster. The conflict: the MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism). A pair of researchers named Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins), notice what he's talking about and realize he is indeed correct. The nest looks about ready to hatch, and officials order the workers to kill it- but they fail, and we get our first glimpse of the MUTO. These things look like a cross between tarantulas and bats- they're absolutely TERRIFYING. After an attack at the plant, the military is ordered to follow the MUTO wherever it goes.<br/><br/>Ford is brought into a room where they show him footage of supposed nuclear tests on 1954 that weren't, in fact, tests. They were attempts to kill the creature they call, ""Gojira"". It is revealed that Gojira is on the move too, but they don't know where. In Hawaii, the MUTO from earlier in the movie and a wing-less MUTO attack. One has knocked a submarine into the rainforest and another is attacking the airport. At the airport is where we see the titular creature. After a tsunami, he appears, and stomps over to the airport in what might be one of the coolest reveals I've ever seen. A full pan up his body to his face revealing a horrifying sinister grin, before he lets out his infamous roar that has made him such a household name.<br/><br/>It's true that Godzilla's screen time is mostly limited to the final act, but the thing is, that is hardly a problem because the rest of the film surrounding his appearance is so good. There's tons of suspense and intrigue. One thing the film really does good is show how substantial the damage is- not by showing the attacks outright but showing the aftermath- the presence of the MUTO attacks is felt through those shots, which only makes the actual attack that much more horrifying. The film does a good job at making us care for the characters too, and you also really hope that Ford will make it home on time too. <br/><br/>The cinematography in the film is just magnificent. Gareth Edwards' direction is magnificent and he has an eye for detail. Whereas most monster/disaster movies show the attacks and what not outright, he chooses to limit your perspective of the attacks and what not to small doses. This is incredibly effective so then you won't feel tired of the film by the time the final battle swings around. It's just a few minutes over two hours, and it goes by very quickly. <br/><br/>By the time Godzilla shows up for the final battle, you've gone for so long without him that you don't even care he's been out of the movie for so long, and that is because the scenes with the MUTOs are satisfying, the drama is satisfying, and the characters work. The final battle is spectacular. We see a whole battle in full when the HALO Jump bit as seen in the trailers begins. The battle itself is just wicked, if you're like me and you took great joy in watching a guy in a ridiculous rubber suit battling another guy in a rubber suit, the battle feels almost like an updated version of that. Gareth's attention to detail also shows here- when we finally see his atomic breath, his spines light up one by one, only making it more exciting. Oh, and the final minute of the movie is amazing too. I won't give it away, but it's chilling. Synced with Desplat's score, it's just beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, I give the film a 9/10. Not since The Avengers has the summer season started off so satisfyingly. If I had one gripe, it's a small one at that, it's that there is a bit too much MUTO screen time, but that doesn't take away too much. I for sure look forward to seeing it a third time, and eventually owning the movie when it comes out on blu-ray!"
"ziga321","3","3","8","18 May 2014"," bored out from this special effects showoff..
","If I would rate this movie on special effects only it would be a perfect 10, but otherwise it's pretty boring. I remember watching Roland Emmerich Godzilla back when I was a kid, and like any other movie in that day, for instance Independence day I loved it, maybe you say, that I was a kid in that time, and I just can't appreciate things or see things as I see thing back then, but the problem is there is nothing even particularly interesting in this new version of Godzilla.<br/><br/>I never understand what's with all the action heroes movie frenzy. In Spiderman(2002) you have two heroes in a swimming suit who are fighting, here you have two monsters that are fighting in the same way that in every other action heroes movies.. and 'oh my god' is it booooring.... Movies like, they are called 'thrillers', they were supposed to make you care for the characters and they were supposed to move you out of your seat and here I didn't move even an inch.. And I doubt if its ever possible for me, to get old like that..<br/><br/>Like I say If I talk about special effects, characters animations and all that its perfect 10, or maybe 9 out of 10, but otherwise this has been boring as hell.. This movie is all about special effects, so much effort is put into, that whats considered atmosphere is just beauty and awe, it's just so shallow.. And I am not against beauty and awe, when its put to good use, but All aside, it's stable to say you would be more moved just running 3dMark with the new computer, then this movie.."
"jaybhoy07","9","3","8","18 May 2014"," My take on this Reboot of the Classic
","My first ever movie review: I absolutely loved this movie and for this particular reason, the great sense of realism tied in with a great character storyline made this not just a ""Transformers"" movie, or ""pacific rim"" in the sense that it was a throw back to the movies such as ""Alien"" or ""Jaws"". The sense of anticipation, tension and creating that theatre moment, that practically has you salivating leading up to the big reveal! And when it hits, boy, it gets it spot on, the shots and cinematography are nothing short of majestic, and a great deal of credit must go to the director. This is a movie that could have failed in so many ways,and yet the simplicity and sense of beauty and realism captured in this film makes you appreciate the art of telling a story and getting emotionally involved in the characters. This film shouldn't be categorized as just another Monster movie, It's a solid story with great scene sequences and above all that it captures personality....A must see!"
"keelan_ruls","10","3","8","17 May 2014"," A Cetinich Review (#6 - Godzilla) A Movie That Needs A Higher Rating Than 10
","As a person who has never had the chance to watch the classic Godzilla's, I'll have to admit that going into this movie I didn't know what to expect. But after sitting in the theatre for 123 minutes, Godzilla blew my mind. <br/><br/>It really was incredible. A movie that really deserves a higher rating than 10 and that's saying something. To me, it was the perfect monster thriller everybody has been wanting to see. Jam-packed with action, a great story and a well-chosen cast(don't listen to the people that say the acting was cheesy), Godzilla will be seen as a one of a kind movie for years to come.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film was the best I've seen in any movie. I've never in my life seen CGI as great as this. Think Pacific Rim, and multiply it by like 10 and that's the CGI to expect in the film. It was a dark and almost realistic movie from start to finish. A large kudos to Gareth Edwards for directing this blockbuster - he has a great eye for detail and story and hopefully will make more great films like this one. <br/><br/>The true King of the Monsters, Godzilla reigns supreme over all monster flicks with its originality and freshness that one expects to see. Why Godzilla has a 7.6 currently on IMDb baffles me - don't listen to the haters. Go in with an open mind and you will sit there on the edge of your seat enjoying what will be a classic in years to come. <br/><br/>GODZILLA!!! The King of the Monsters, and The King of the Monster Genre.<br/><br/>Acting - 10/10.<br/><br/>Writing - 10/10.<br/><br/>Action - 10/10.<br/><br/>Setting - 10/10. <br/><br/>Overall Rating - 10/10."
"SHIELDfox","8","3","8","17 May 2014"," A great film, highly recommended
","Before I saw this movie, I looked up other people's opinions online and was met with some rather mixed feelings. Some thought this was a great film, with the best acting and effects they'd ever seen, while others thought of the 2014 Godzilla as a monstrosity (if you'd pardon the pun)<br/><br/>Personally, my opinion reaches the middle. The movie as a whole, was really good. The CGI was incredible and there was some amazing acting on behalf of Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston. The most common complaint I saw was that there was a lack of Godzilla, with the creature only appearing three times. Whereas actually, this wasn't true - Godzilla does have a fair few scenes through the movie. I found the balance between showing the creature's antics and following the human's reaction to the terror to be quite fair. There wasn't a whole lot of action throughout the movie however, with short bursts of excitement being teased all the way through, leading up to the last 10/15 minutes. But this isn't just a mindless monster movie, this is also an emotional one - for the most part showing Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, attempting to reach his family and ensure their safety.<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert for the next paragraph) My only real complaint was how misleading the trailer was. In the trailers, Bryan Cranston's character Joe Brody was made out to be the protagonist, where this is far from the case - he is essentially only in the film to introduce the audience to Godzilla, and he actually dies near the beginning. I feel like Cranston was only cast to promote and sell the movie, as halfway through it was easy to forget that he was ever on our screen in the first place. <br/><br/>Overall, I do highly recommend Godzilla. While others may not think so, I found this to be a perfect blend of action and emotion, with some all round good acting and astonishing CGI. 8/10"
"FlashCallahan","8","3","8","17 May 2014"," CGI so good, you'd think its a man in a suit.....
","Edwards got this gig on the strength of his very impressive movie 'Monsters' a film that wasn't about monsters you'd expect, but the metaphorical ones that use and abuse their fellow man.<br/><br/>And now comes Godzilla, Emmerich had a shot at it in 98, and missed the target by miles, and its ironic how this film begins in 1999, and Edwards delivers the goods in droves.<br/><br/>Nuclear is the word of the day, from references to Hiroshima, to a reactor being destroyed, then to the literal Nuclear family, Godzilla is a different beast when it comes to spectacle.<br/><br/>After a prologue involving much destruction, we are sent to the present day, where Bryan Cranston is in deep trouble as he has been arrested for being on a restricted area he used to call home, so Johnson goes to help.<br/><br/>And then from there its a blast from beginning to end, Johnson's desperation to get back to his wife and son, but all the while doing the right thing and trying to help others.<br/><br/>Edwards also focuses on the family as a whole, and its evident in several scenes, especially when the young boy gets on the train by mistake, and then later reunited, which is a touching moment in all the chaos.<br/><br/>And then there is the spectacle. The film does bring to mind other blockbusters. It has the feel of 2005's War Of The Worlds, it has an eerie atmosphere throughout, and a strange sense of dread. <br/><br/>And comparisons to Pacific Rim are there, but this film appreciates its characters and makes them involving. Del Toro messed up big time with that movie, and in the end it was just Robot Jox with a big budget. It's as if 2014 is making up for last summer.<br/><br/>And finally we get to the man himself, Godzilla. And he's a marvel to look at. It's as if Edwards has almost made a CG man in a rubber suit. He's not in it much throughout the film, but when he appears, it's truly awe-inspiring, and when he roars, blimey, does he roar.<br/><br/>With some wonderful support from Strathairn, Watanabe, and Hawkins, Godzilla is a wonderful start to what looks set to be a truly wonderful summer.<br/><br/>And even though its a pretty serious summer movie, come the final shot, you know you've seen a good old fashioned summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing, 3D isn't amazing though."
"jaredmartin-464-711711","5","3","8","16 May 2014"," American Godzilla Attempt Number Two
","Godzilla is a part of my childhood, and the 1954 film is a monster movie I hold in pretty high regard. Yes effects wise the film is dated, and the acting is so so, but the overall premise is hauntingly mesmerizing. The idea of a monster being spawned by mankind's arrogance of nuclear weapons, that destroys everything in it's path, and is seemingly unstoppable, is a terrifying premise. This is something the 1954 version captures very well, and what the 2014 version advertised itself as.<br/><br/>What I got was a film that was at times, as silly as the 1998 version. Godzilla 2014 tries desperately hard to create this sense of seriousness, and believability, with a script writer(s) who can't write (fictionalized) reality in a credible way. The script by Callaham, and Borenstein, is so shallow, and lacking any real depth, that even the likes of a great actor like Bryan Cranston, can't save this film. If Cranston can't save it, there's no way Olsen, Johnson, Watanabe, or anyone else can save it either. <br/><br/>I like all these actors, but their talent is wasted, because nothing in the story gives any of their characters real gravitas. Cranston departs from the film FAR too early, and the audience is left with dull (wooden) characters, that sadly aren't ever really developed. If none of this stuff matters to the average movie goer, and people just wan't Godzilla fighting, or destroying things, then the characters are not all that important I suppose. Problem is Godzilla has maybe 13 to 15 mins of actual screen time in a 2 hr. film, which is mostly in the last 30 mins of film. <br/><br/>Now I've read articles, and watched interviews where director Gareth Edwards has said films like Jaws, and Jurassic Park were inspirations for this new Godzilla. Edwards expressed interest in having a slow reveal like Jaws, where the shark is rarely seen until the end, but it's presence is felt throughout the film. I get that approach, but you have to have strong characters, and a well paced plot to use that approach, something this movie doesn't really have. <br/><br/>This film also seems to have a bit of an identity crisis where it doesn't know what it want's to be. Does it wan't to be gritty, and dark, like say the original Godzilla, or Cloverfield, or if it want's to be more fun, and action packed, like last year's Pacific Rim. This was my initial concern with this new Godzilla including other monsters, which for me automatically cheapens Godzilla's original metaphor, from a man made freak of nature, to earth's mightiest antihero. Positive wise the film has some wonderful shots of mayhem/destruction, but I need more from a film than some flashy CGI effects, I need a coherent plot, with fleshed out characters, which in Godzilla 2014 was never fully realized. I will always have the original I guess, I would've liked an updated serious take on Godzilla, what I got was shallow mindless ""so called"" entertainment. <br/><br/>For some this movie will have just enough monster mayhem that will captivate it's audience, but I was hoping for more. I was expecting a good character driven drama, with a compelling story, what I got was a subpar story, with a boring lead, and lifeless characters. Godzilla isn't a terrible film by any means, but it sure isn't the great return of Godzilla I had hoped for, and it's disappointing to say the least."
"DinoMovieFan","10","3","8","16 May 2014"," The KING is Back! Godzilla, King of the Monsters
","I just went into theaters to see ""Godzilla"" with high anticipation that it will bring justice to the titular monster. Sure enough, it did more than just that because at the end of the movie I was proud that the movie had exemplified him as the ultimate force of nature as he originally was.<br/><br/>First of all, the visual effects blew me away. Jim Rygiel did a well-done job in creating a credible and believable world where Godzilla and the M.U.T.O. really existed. The texture and the visuals of the monsters are really the highlight of the film when you can see how detailed Godzilla's scales and fins are. The environments were suitably covered in fog, dangling vegetation, and dust with the low lighting in some scenes to enhance the dark, gritty tone of the movie. Having a veteran visual effects supervisor like Jim Rygiel, who previously worked in the critically acclaimed Lord of The Ring Trilogy, really helped to pull of the realism and grittiness of the Kaiju interacting with the human world magnificently.<br/><br/>Second, the choice of the cast was really well-thought out and their performance on screen was solid. Big credit goes to Bryan Cranston, who plays as Joe Brody, a disillusioned physicist who bore emotional scars of the incident that destroyed his wife and tore his family apart. The way Bryan delved into the emotional performance of his character did more than enough to convince me that what he went through is a HUGE, serious deal. <br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson was a good choice to play Ford Brody. Even though he might seem emotionally bland at times, but those are minor flaws that are far and few in between. He still managed to genuinely show emotions that borderline on fear, anxiety, frustration, care and concern when he had to help his suffering father in Japan or when he had his wife and son's safety to worry about in the midst of the chaos in San Francisco.<br/><br/>The movie's other strong points would be in the pacing of the film. More akin to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" where it shows only glances of Godzilla until halfway through the movie. Then when it comes to the battles, they are not instantly one thing after another that makes the audience tire quickly, but they are cut at certain points for a long time to allow the viewers to catch their breath in between until it reaches to the climax where all that anticipation is released in a satisfying and jaw-dropping moment. Some of the people who like to be gratified with instantaneous shots of action and mayhem may not agree with this, but I thought that it was a smart move on the director's part to do so <br/><br/>Overall, I rank this movie at 9/10 for its brilliant visuals of the monsters,strong story and plot, the solid acting performance of the human cast that signify above average character development, and the excellent choice of the film pacing that echoes Steven Spielberg's style."
"Adam-woolston14","9","3","8","16 May 2014"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I'll be honest, I had low expectations here. This movie was hyped, but I expected another poorly made, badly acted, mindless explosion/destruction/monster fighting/pacific rim nonsense. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe are both awesome in their acting. Godzilla himself is a slow build, but once this movie gets going it really gets going. The final battle is one of the greatest monster movie fight scenes I've ever seen, and they do a good job of giving this movie heart. Well done. The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because some of the explanations of HOW gigantic lizards and bug-things exist aren't really convincing, and much of the Physics and logic is off. But who cares? It's freaking Godzilla! Also, speaking of him, he looks more like the classic monster than the abomination that was the 1998 Matthew Broderick flick. It was a nice nod to his origins while the amazing advances of modern CGI made him a million times as scary. I freaking loved it"
"martin-disobey","9","3","8","16 May 2014"," Yes!!
","I'm actually hoping for a few sequels. A film series with old Godzilla monsters such as King Ghidorah or Mothra might just work out. They kept Godzilla's image just proud as oppose to the 1998 version that made it feel like the monster was pitted at the end. They kept a lot of originality such as his roar, appearance, and radioactive beam. So glad that the movie didn't focus mainly on the humans like most movies nowadays. Good thing that they didn't ruin it by making Godzilla just hunted down, but actually had an opponent(s). I do wish that it would have had high shots like in the originals instead of giving a human perspective. The old movies captured the faces of the monster better and that would have helped out."
"Hellmant","8","3","8","16 May 2014"," Doesn't even come close to the best monster flicks!
","'GODZILLA': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Modern American reboot to the immensely popular Japanese monster flick franchise. It's the first 'Godzilla' film in ten years (following 2004's 'GODZILLA: FINAL WARS', which marked the character's 50th anniversary) and only the second 'Godzilla' movie filmed entirely by an American studio (following director Roland Emmerich's 1998 remake). It was directed by Gareth Edwards (who previously directed and wrote the 2010 ultra-low-budget monster flick 'MONSTERS') and written by Max Borenstein and David Callaham (co-writer of 'THE EXPENDABLES'); three other film writers did rewrites but were uncredited (David S. Goyer, Drew Pearce and Frank Darabont). The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins, Juliette Binoche and David Strathairn. It's another origins tale and it also has Godzilla taking on other gigantic creatures. The visuals are great and the kaiju fight scenes are spectacular but the film as a whole is disappointing and mostly a bore! <br/><br/>The story begins in 1999 when two scientists, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Hawkins), discover two pods in the Philippines (one of which has hatched). We then meet a nuclear physicist, named Joe Brody (Cranston), and his wife Sandra (Binoche), a nuclear regulations consultant, who work at the Janjira Nuclear Plant (near Tokyo). The plant has a meltdown, which kills Sandra, and the disaster is witnessed by their son Ford (CJ Adams) from his school nearby. Everyone in the area is evacuated, while it's quarantined, and fifteen years go by with Joe obsessing over what caused the meltdown. Ford (now played by Taylor-Johnson) is a lieutenant in the United States Navy (and bomb disposal expert). He also now has a wife (Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde) of his own. Joe is constantly being arrested, for investigating his conspiracy theories, and Ford travels to Japan to help him. Once there he reluctantly returns to his old home, with his father, where the two discover a government cover-up (proving Joe was right). They meet Dr. Serizawa and learn that giant monsters (which feed on radiation) have been wrecking havoc all over the world (for many years). A Muto (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) is currently on the loose and Serizawa believes that a monster he's been studying for years, called Godzilla, is the only thing that can stop it.<br/><br/>Monster movie fans often say these movies would be better without any humans in them; I usually disagree but in this case I'd say they're right. None of the people are likable in this film, except for Dr. Serizawa (he has all the best lines and Watanabe gives the only decent performance). Cranston overacts, Taylor-Johnson underacts and everyone else seems almost nonexistent. If you cut all the humans out of the movie it would only be like 25 to 30 minutes long though and having an entire feature length film full of just monsters fighting would be pretty boring as well. The visuals are cool but the tease of never fully showing the fights (or monsters) in their entirety, until the end, really doesn't work. It works in movies like 'MONSTERS' and 'CLOVERFIELD' because in those films the humans are interesting and fun to watch; this is just way too dry, overly long and slowly paced. I think Edwards is a talented director but with all those experienced writers you should be able to expect a much better film than this (a twelve-year-old seriously could have wrote it)! The fight scenes are cool though and the ending is a blast; it's great seeing Godzilla on the big screen and it is better than Emmerich's version. It doesn't even come close to the best monster flicks though (and I'm a huge monster movie fan); Peter Jackson's 'KING KONG' remake and Guillermo del Toro's 'PACIFIC RIM' (from last year) are so much better than this. Del Toro wants to do a crossover though (of this and 'PACIFIC RIM'); now that would be really cool!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PJuAEBeRQ"

","First of all don't expect more by seeing the trailer which was so awesome. Godzilla which is a reboot of Roland Emmerich version released in 1998 which appears more bigger and stronger creatures that its previous version.<br/><br/>The film tells us the history of Godzilla's previous appearance from the past and its rivalry with MUTO (MOBILE UNIDENTIFIED TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS). About the story line its good and will get proper knowledge about the things that happened in past. The main highlight of this film is its VFX. The intro of Godzilla is so cool and awesome with a stunning BGM. The fight between Godzilla and MUTO is so good which gives us goosebumps.<br/><br/>Godzilla's less screen space is one of the negative side that I noticed in the film. In the case of MUTO its vice versa. Another one is about the Human characters. Bryan Cranston is the only one that I find appealing. But sadly he just only for few minutes only. Aaron Taylor is just for covering the screen. 3D effects is another negative in this film. Nowadays 3D is considered as a best way to make more income.<br/><br/>To sum up Godzilla is one the best reboot film compared to the previous version. But don't expect awesome stunts like Pacific Rim and set your expectation level to the bare minimum, you should be able to enjoy the film."

","He is back with the bang, this time bigger and better and breaths sky-fire! but yes, now Godzilla appears fewer and lesser times than in the previous editions because its not all about him for there is introduction of new monsters which would challenge the legacy of Godzilla.<br/><br/>Story is about a scientist and his family which in some way establishes a connection for us to meet these creatures, we know the plot is just woven and not so important, so as the presence of the actors which is nothing much apart of a being a placeholder, and there will always be a scientist which would accurately decode what these creatures are up to, predictable stuff this.<br/><br/>CGI is descent and fight and destruction sequences are on par with the recent Pacific Rim movie. Godzilla is introduced very late in the movie, and we don't get to see him as much one would have liked. little sad, apart from this for the most part these monsters appears in the night, not so great especially when you are watching them 3D glasses , it makes it even darker. <br/><br/>I wont say this movie is mind blowing, but if you are fan of mega creature movies, you for sure wont be disappointed with the scale and might of this lord of creatures!"

Not a bad back story built into this movie. Pretty decent characterization. Down sides- Their science is as horrible as ever. My son says: ""It's Godzilla.

","There is something brilliant about Godzilla that I'm convinced people will complain about, it's what I complained about. ""The military have no effect on the plot, they're useless"". That is the point, their scenes may be pointless and ineffective but that is because they are dealing with Godzilla, the God is in the title. We are never given too much Godzilla because it is bigger than us, all we can do is watch from the sidelines while it wrecks havoc. It's a movie about nature taking back and how little control we have over it, we can send the army in but in the end it doesn't matter. The storytelling choices are perfect because they make us watch through a TV screen or from the soldiers on the ground. Godzilla shows just how irrelevant humans are, one minute we're here and the next minute we're gone and it doesn't really matter. The characters are the way they are because they're not really characters, they're just another group of ants in the colony that is slowly but surely being purged. This is a god damn horror movie and to quote Matt Zoller Seitz, ""it's all about perspective and point-of-view—not just what you're seeing but how much, and under what circumstances."""

","WARNING! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br/><br/>As a person who grew up idolizing Toho's King Of The Monster's, I was ecstatic to hear of, and now see, Gareth Edwards' version of the main man himself. Unfortunately, though it is a film that will satisfy any man child alive today, I can't help feeling a tiny bit let down.<br/><br/>In my opinion , some of the acting was quite good, but some lacked a little. Throughout the film, scenes of extraordinary terrors roll out but the people don't seem to be terrified, at least to a realistic standard. Fortunately there's no terrible acting. The film also has its share of nonsensical moments too. Scenes where something that should be very apparent, are somehow missed by those who have a prime location to notice it. Kinda felt like a filler shot leading up to a reveal. I don't know how I would have preferred the scene to carry out. Certainly not cutting straight to the point, but I do know that blindly ignoring the big stand out thing simply looks silly in hindsight. It is a hard decision that's for sure.<br/><br/>After some teasing scenes of the goodness, shots of G-man being unnecessarily cautious and some plot driving things and stuff, we finally arrive at the showdown. Quite satisfactory I must say. I do however feel that it lacked a punch or two. It felt too broken up or that is wasn't as retina enveloping as I had hoped for. Basically, I feel that the audience was only given a semi-all out death brawl, rather than the suburb crushing, tower toppling, monster mash you expect from this kind of film. It does however have its moments, and trust me, there are shots that'll make the manliest of man children shed a tear due to the overwhelming nostalgia. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, even with its floors. The CGI is truly amazing and the new look to Godzilla impressed me. They kept to the look of the original but made him a more natural looking, bulkier monster. If you are a fan of the King Of The Monsters, I urge you to see it. Those who are more critical of films, You'll still like it. It's giant monsters fighting to the death. Come on.<br/><br/>Nicholas Parry"

","I had high hopes for this Godzilla movie, and it started out very well, but eventually turned to become somewhat a mess. I agree that Bryan Cranston acts very well, but it is not enough to make the movie watchable. I feel like the director is insulting our intelligence by letting the army make the same mistakes over and over again (planes falling out of skies even though they knew it would happen) and soldiers carrying ordinary rifles for no reason, the Americans always resolving to the nuke to solve a problem. There is some bad acting in this movie, and the well made CGI cannot make up for it. I felt like the history should have been explained better and the movie should perhaps have had a little more Pacific Rim over its style"

I was actually looking forward to this flic as I generally love sci- fi/hero/fantasy/action movies, but this was so crap I want to sue someone to get the time spent watching it repaid to my life. I'm sorry to everyone who starred in this film, or produced it, or did anything in it, and the vfx artists involved... It is so rubbish it just isn't funny.

","It made my sick. Stupidest of the stupid. It really insulted my intelligence. I may never watch Hollywood production again.<br/><br/>Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood cliché. Unlike the viewers, the film believes its characters are fascinating enough to merit the laughably corny near- death and family- reunion scenes towards the end. Instead, the audience is left laughing in bemusement at the overly sincere expressions on the protagonist's face as he threatens a giant monster with a handgun. Whenever Godzilla and the insects finally begin to fight, before anything happens there's an instant cut to yet another tedious shot of US soldiers shouting about nothing in particular. The film's sole purpose is to showcase the might of America's armed forces and ability to survive under a crisis; and it doesn't even do that well, given that the navy can't even tell when Godzilla is swimming directly under their ships. Of course, setting the story in Godzilla's homeland of Japan would not interest American viewers, so the monster decides to swim across the Pacific Ocean in order to wreak havoc. No doubt Godzilla will receive acclaim from morons due to its high-tech but utterly unimaginative animation techniques. However, this film's cutting-edge CGI does not justify its lack of plot, excitement and meaningful characters."

","Hollywood's marketing team struck again. They showed us a promising trailer, they gave us hope this movie would finally turn the ship around and show some actual story, character and heart. <br/><br/>They got us, again. This movie starts off well. The first 20 min or so were climbing up the Fujiyama of storytelling. Revealing that the whole mystery about ancient Kaijus was never really a mystery to an elite group of multi-national scientists. That's about all there is to the story, no further investigation here. The movie does not climax on this subplot, nor on any other. The Fujiyama falls apart to a small Diamond Head.<br/><br/>Cranston is taken out after a brief, very well acted intro, then his could-not-care-less son takes over and runs the movie into its own grave. <br/><br/>We have him who is facing his father's fate, leaving behind his wife and promising on the phone he would do anything to get home and save them. He ends up doing all kinds of things but that. <br/><br/>He is transported on a helicopter which magically crosses the Pacific from ""East of Japan"" to, of course, Honolulu. There, he gets trapped in the San Francisco Airport which is, again magic comes into play, now the Honolulu Airport. Weird. <br/><br/>Here comes a badly written substitute, gap filling scene where he ""rescues"" a little Japanese boy who gets separated from his parents. Being maybe reminded of his own son, he then appears in the desert of Nevada to, you expected it: magically become the only living soldier who knows anything about ICBMs. Wow, aren't we all lucky? <br/><br/>In the meantime, his wife sends their son on a suicide mission on a school bus over the Golden Gate bridge while she herself stays back for what reason? Doesn't matter. <br/><br/>The military, which figured out the fastest way to lure the monsters away from the city is to put some nuclear missiles on a 20 mi/h train through the Rockies. Great thinking. Here comes Lt. Ford something again ready for a HALO jump into the city. And because he was the only one who cared, he floods the monster's nest that he accidentally finds, by uncapping a fire hydrant that, magically of course, was apparently there, in this 75"" deep hole in the city. After that, the whole puddle explodes. Talk about less trash in a Hollywood movie. <br/><br/>That is pretty much the movie. But there is also Ken Watanabe who plays a useless Japanese scientist who only speaks in short phrases but has nothing to say, actually. <br/><br/>Also, there is his English assistant who has no job whatsoever. <br/><br/>An Admiral who commands a group of warships that don't fire a single shot at a monster but follow Godzilla all the way through the Pacific until they lose him. He then somehow re-appears in the Oakland command center to take over Air and Ground forces. Wut?!<br/><br/>None of the plots in this movie make any sense. None are resolved and no story is told. It is merely a poorly written scene-by-scene trying to chain events together no matter the fit. It is inconsistent, unrealistic and boring. <br/><br/>The only ray of hope is Godzilla. Yes, you heard right, he is in the movie! He appears for about ten minutes. Fights off the two bugs, then gets himself kicked but then comes back and kills them all off. Luckily, he survives and goes back to his underwater castle. ""A hero to the city"" the news claim. Well, yes, three monsters killing hundreds of thousands of people. People the military does not care about (""They think it's an earthquake. Let's make sure they keep believing that."") and can't protect, anyways. <br/><br/>What is the message of this movie? What is the story of this movie? Who are the people in this movie? They forgot to make a movie!"

","(SPOILERS) - Best to Read if You Have Already Seen It, or Don't Care!<br/><br/>I thought the new ""Godzilla"" was disappointing. The original Toho ""Godzillas"" are so much more fun. Or, should I say, they actually TRY to be fun. This movie is a turgid slog, filled with boring characters that you couldn't possibly care about. Whoever decided on the casting needs to get a new job! Honestly, the dude from ""Kick-Ass?"" An Olson twin? Good heavens!<br/><br/>After the hilariously nuts Emmerich-Devlin ""Godzilla,"" you would think this one HAS to be better! But, it isn't. At least the 1998 ""Godzilla"" was entertaining, in it's own goofy way. Here, it's about as much fun as ""Saving Private Ryan!""<br/><br/>I get it. Director Gareth Edwards was trying to recapture the feeling of the great original Japanese 1952 ""Gojira."" Note that I am not talking about the Americanized 1954 ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"" which was marred by its choppiness.<br/><br/>In the original ""Gojira,"" there is really only about 10 minutes or so of actual Godzilla crushing stuff. The rest is the human drama with the well-drawn characters. But, in that movie, those characters are very well realized. They are fully fleshed out, and the drama that plays throughout carries through to the emotional conclusion.<br/><br/>The problem here is that all the characters, except Bryan Cranston's, are bland and uninteresting. Plus, there isn't a compelling storyline here, as there was in the 1952 ""Gojira."" And, most critically (MAJOR SPOILER) Cranston's character dies early on. He could have been used as that tragic character who has to sacrifice himself. But, unfortunately, he just dies and that's it. (END SPOILER).<br/><br/>I almost titled my review ""Godzilla Without Godzilla,"" since there isn't that much Godzilla in the movie, and when we get to see him, it's mostly in the dark. You would think, 16 years after the 1998 ""Godzilla,"" we'd technologically be at the point where we didn't have to stage the monster action in the dark and/or the rain. But, the $160 million spent here doesn't seem to be enough to make that happen.<br/><br/>Hopefully, since Godzilla lives to fight another day at the end of this movie, we'll get a sequel where we get to see some good old fashioned monster action. In the daytime, please!<br/><br/>***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)"
"darkfury71-290-609164","6","4","13","15 May 2014"," Godzilla blows you out of the water with his atomic fire but his presence is diluted by the lackluster acting of his co-stars and Gareth Edward's long-winded storytelling.
","To put simply, this movie is about 45 minutes too long. I find that it's less about Godzilla and more about the sappy life of Ford Brody(honestly, they couldn't possibly think up a whiter name than that). Of course the writers had to give us a reason to empathise with the protagonist but an hour of long-winded storytelling is just fluff in an otherwise epic journey to take down the monsters. <br/><br/>The saving grace was the CGI for Godzilla himself. The beast was simply amazing and the final kill shot with his atomic fire breath was especially breathtaking. The audience at my theatre were on their feet clapping(although I wasn't sure if it's because it signaled the end of a monstrously long movie or because of the thrill of the kill or perhaps just a little bit of both.) On another note, this particular incarnation of Godzilla is a mere shadow of its original and reverses his role from Japan's crippling fear of all things nuclear post the atrocities of Hiroshima to one of a dubious saviour(Ken's character states that Gojira is feeding but at the end of the film, he doesn't even bother to eat his catch giving the audience the impression that he is in fact an altruistic prehistoric nuclear beast).<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's acting was top notch but I was disappointed that he exited the movie so soon. I was honestly hoping for a father-son duo taking down the prehistoric beasts with a mix of pseudo-science peppered throughout the movie by Bryan and a good olé' shoot-em-up by Aaron. The lead however, played by Aaron Taylor wasn't up to the task. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is just a poor-man's Chris Evans. They look the same, they walk the same, they even kinda talk the same. But Aaron simply lacks the charisma for a leading role here. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was watchable if you ignore the first hour or so. But the ultimate draw here is still Godzilla himself and he does not disappoint. A good way to spend a lazy afternoon but not for much else.<br/><br/>PS Ken Watanabe's ""Gojira"" is absolutely hilarious. I have absolutely no idea if it was intentional. But he sure stuck to it."

","Right, I'll start with killing off Bryan Cranston's character in the first 20 minutes or so. That should really have been the first clue really. I waited for almost an hour for a glimpse of the titular character but I was treated with an hour of boring dialogue by a handful of forgettable characters! There are so many plot holes and awful ""dramatic"" scenes in this movie I couldn't remember them all but here are the ones I remember; Main character amazingly survives a hundred or more foot drop from a railway bridge and wakes up the next morning laid in the middle of hundreds of tons of train wreckage without so much as a scratch - but later ends up with a limp from exploding fuel! The old ""american hero soldier fights to the last and attempts to kill unkillable giant enemy with a pistol"" bit. Failed attempt at making the scenery international but ends up in (what a coincidence) America... again. This isn't the awful 90's version of Godzilla, but it's on par with it. Please don't watch this abomination. If you want special effects instead of plot go watch avatar!"

Bryan's character is dead after less than 15mins screen time and Godzilla probably has even less screen time - including the bits where all you see are the spikes on his back sticking out of the water. I am just so glad I did not pay to watch this - I would have demanded my money back. I feel sorry for those who missed it in the Cinema and decide to spend £15 quid to buy it on BluRay. The story line is just dumb, the monsters look like rejects from Pacific Rim and you only get one half decent monster fight near the end. Even then its too dark to see what is going on half the time.<br/><br/>Total ripoff!"
"paige_dunk","1","3","9","14 September 2014"," Godzilla is Godawful
","I think it would be best if I first establish two things. 1) I am a huge Godzilla fan. 2) Whenever I go to see a movie I go in with a neutral attitude as I don't want to be over-hyped or expecting nothing so I can simply take the movie for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. Having said that, this movie was terrible. For a movie titled Godzilla there is surprisingly little Godzilla in it. I certainly hope that you weren't expecting to see the famous monster in this film at all because there is probably only collectively 5-10 minutes of him in the 123 minute long movie, and no I'm not exaggerating. Beyond that, this movie has no intelligent thought. Any creativity in story, characters, and concept that could have existed is replaced by a cesspool of the most worn-out clichés possible. Starting out at the beginning of the film we have cliché number 1, the work-a-holic father who's never at home but somehow is shockingly sensitive and deeply in love with his wife and is only working hard because he is just so ""driven"" and ""passionate"" and wants to take care of his family; of course. And naturally he has a doting wife who is just as generic and bland as he is, oh but don't fear, she's hard working too but not so independent that she won't readily put herself back into the role of a tamed housewife; someone the ladies can relate to as you can see. And they have a bland and personality-less son who the movie so pretentiously expects you to become invested in within the first ten minutes despite knowing nothing about him and him having no relatable qualities to speak of. After a tragic accident kills our Mary-Sue wife the father evolves from cliché level 1 to cliché level 2: the obsessed truth-seeker. Yes, years after his wife dies in the ""accident"" the husband is trying to discover what caused the destructive earth tremor that killed his wife and so naturally because of his desire for the truth he can have no relationship with his son who is also now at cliché level 2, living in America with a generic wife and child of his own and feasting off of his resentment toward his father while bringing home the bacon as a soldier. Of course this movie staying true to the life of real soldiers, presents that he has an ultra-modern, expensive house with a perfect relationship with his wife and child with absolutely no problems to speak of. After a bunch of bland and clichéd exposition and terrible acting he reunites unhappily with his dad to discover the truth about the earth tremors, two insect-like monsters are freed from the earth, Godzilla is awakened and decides to go after the monsters, and the US army seems to be the only ones doing anything about the problem despite the movie clearly showing that the insect monsters have devastated other countries (I guess the armies of those countries just took a vacation so we could make ours the center of attention; how nice of them). So what is there to hate about this? Everything. The soundtrack is like the leftover scrap music from Transformers. The characters are clichéd, boring, one-dimensional (can they be half dimensional? I think that's a better description), un-relatable, and completely impossible to invest in despite the movie's attempts to make you feel that you should be. From beginning to end the movie is dark and washed out looking and spends too much time on nonsense and not enough time on what really matters. It showcases poor movie writing at its best as the movie has no idea what to focus on or what it is even really about. It is just a mishmash of special effects which you barely get to look at since the action scenes are so sloppily filmed that everything is blurred or can't be focused on, giving you no time to appreciate even that much about the film. The storyline (if you can call it that) has more holes than Hugh Hefner has had girls. The pacing is rushed in some spots and painfully slow in others; most Dora the Explorer episodes are better paced and more exciting than this. Nothing about the mood or presentation of the film says ""Godzilla"" and is a disgrace to the classic legacy of Godzilla. And for those who are Godzilla fans and have seen the dreadful 1998 film, yes, this one is just as bad. And of course the film has almost no Godzilla in it and the ending battle with Godzilla is a poorly filmed, sloppy, rushed, and completely bland and un-creative end to a lifeless movie, so if you were hoping that at least the climax of the film was going to be worth all of your suffering, think again. Do not waste your time. Unless you are a fan of watching a movie devoid of everything except for random action, shouting, American egotism, worn out clichés, and special effects then do not watch this movie."
"Fredrik-Hamper","1","3","9","8 September 2014"," Long and boring
","I'm not quick to label something as boring but this movie was. It was long, dull and just plain boring. I remember the 1998 movie well and it was amazing compared to this. Something it had that this movie didn't was emotion. This movie lacked any emotion. I cared for the monsters though but this is due to the nostalgia I have with the Godzilla franchise.<br/><br/>I feel offended when I see the same cookie-cut characters in movies. Why? They react to events and people in ways that are overly predictable. In a straight out monster movie you can get away with this but this movie was barely a monster movie - it focused on the characters for over three-quarters of the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing - everything was so serious. It seems to be a trend in recent movies to have everything take place in darkness.. or a stagnant gray atmosphere.<br/><br/>The 1998 movie was better. Actually, the director of the current Godzilla, made a better movie a few years back called, ""Monsters""."
"i_am_bryony","1","3","9","29 August 2014"," Unbelievably bad
","As is my habit, I'm going to make a short list of everything I hated about this movie.<br/><br/>1) Everything.<br/><br/>That was too easy, let's try again.<br/><br/>1) Appalling acting. The main 'character' seems to have had his face frozen before filming, so his only expression is one of bemused disinterest.<br/><br/>2) The military can see that guns and bombs have no effect on the monsters, so they continue to attack them with bombs and guns. Once they learn that the Muto has an EMP weapon, they continue to use electrical equipment. In fact...<br/><br/>3) Everything the military did was so half assed and poorly researched that I found myself shouting at the TV screen. Special forces making all that noise, and their torches shining all over the place? A HALO jump without proper preparation? An naval OED luitenant with HALO experienceand training? We don't have time to open the casing of the bomb, sowe'll carry it through the city for a couple of miles and put it on a boat. yeah, that will be much faster and not dangerous or stupid at all. Not with that huge monster that feeds on nuclear bombs searching for it after we killed her entire brood.<br/><br/>4) The bomb, we are told, makes the one that levelled Hiroshima look like a firecracker, goes off about 2 miles offshore and causes absolutely no damage to anything at all. Either it was a dud, or we have to believe that American engineering, and indeed Americans, are impervious to things like blasts, fireballs, concussion or radiation. Not like those Japanese weaklings. USA! USA!<br/><br/>5) When the monsters reach SF, we see Godzilla wade through the water which is just about up to his knees, but then a Muto dives in head first and disappears for a few seconds.<br/><br/>6) EMP would have no effect on a petrol or diesel powered engine. It might stop the ignition, but once its running then it is mechanical rather than electrical.<br/><br/>7) Have you any idea how heavy a nuclear warhead is? You don't just pick it up and carry it around. But hey, one American soldier saves the world, yet again.<br/><br/>8) Godzilla. OK, its hard to make a big monster look real, I understand that, but to make it so flat and unthreatening must take at least as much effort. it remeinded me of the old Chewits advert half the time, the other half I was wondering where he/she was. There is about a minutes worth of Godzilla screen time thats worth watching, the rest he/she is either playing hide and seek with battleships of sneaking through the city, hunting Motus for some reason thats never adequately explained.<br/><br/>9) The bomb. Yes, again. That really angered me. When we first see the Motu nest, its about 150 feet down a crater, but the marines just appear at the bottom and somehow manage to appear back at the top a few minutes later despite carrying a live and armed nuclear missile.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about flimsy plot lines, the cardboard cut out cliché cast and absurd twists etc, but the whole film would fall apart. This int a creature feature, nor is it a thriller or an action movie. it is entirely fraudulent and deserves to be erased from history. 1/10"

","Godzilla is much loved by the Japanese & after watching this movie I can see why. The movie doesn't have a complex plot or any real depth to character development but that's perfectly OK because Godzilla takes center stage & he's not just some giant monster that kills everything in his path either, he actually seems to have a heart & cares for mother nature & the human race. In one scene when the Navy were firing upon him at the Golden Gate Bridge he stumbled & grabbed hold of the bridge but knowing that there were people on the bridge he gently let go (as gently something his size can be) so not to harm anyone. To me he's the majestic guardian; so take the time to look into the heart of the iconic giant & you might like what you see.

","This film involved a bunch of stories about characters that added nothing but boredom to a film that didn't need all that. Bryan Cranston's character seemed to be developing into the brains behind mankind's ability to survive the unthinkable. That disappointingly fizzled into nothingness. The ONE thing he discovered was not something the scientific minds that had been studying the situation for umpteen years could figure out on their own???! What?? Ken Watanabe spent the entire film looking bewildered, shocked, and/or confused. His assistant was even more useless. Then our leading man, the hero...I'm still trying to figure out what he did and what made him worth following around for near two hours. In a Godzilla movie, I mean. He did ONE really cool, smart thing...that had no effect on the overall monster problem. The rest of the time he was just as confused and helpless as everyone else. He was an upstanding serviceman and I would never count a real man of that stature any less than a hero. But in a Godzilla movie what about him made him worth filming more than any of the other military officers fighting to save humanity?? I got sick of watching Godzilla swim! After the first TWO times-dope as it was, they overdid that mess. They didn't even properly insert Godzilla into the story. They talked about him and then he just showed up swimming. We didn't get to the fun until the very end. And the stuff leading up to it was not worth while. NO COMIC RELIEF!! NONE! It was so dry, I started to get cottonmouth! I actually remember a moment in my mind thinking, ""my goodness, I'm bored. Am I...surely there must be something wrong with me. Am I in a bad mood? It can't be the movie's fault. Surely not."" But alas, it was. I had little expectations, but I expected to enjoy myself in some kind of way. This script was so unoriginal and lacking I started fantasizing much better lines and performances characters could have delivered in real time. It's as if they copy and pasted a few Hollywood clichés because they needed to kill time so that they could get away with spending all their resources and efforts on graphics. That might explain the lengthy list of virtually unrecognizable cast members. They even killed of one of their top billers 20 minutes in. Cheaper cast makes way for more expensive graphics I guess. They put no thought at all into this billion dollar prank, while somehow over-thinking it. The story about the monster issue was all they needed and that would have probably produced a better film!!<br/><br/>The good about this film: There was little to no profanity. I can't even recall if there was any. There was no sexual content. Like...none. I was extremely impressed. There was a short moment shared between a husband and wife and, where Hollywood has conditioned me to expect it, the over-indulged sexuality did not follow. Lastly, the graphics were excellent.<br/><br/>All the same, I've never watched a movie with so many anticlimactic sub-stories. It really had some great moments visually, a couple action-oriented sequences were great. But man...oh man...somehow they managed to bore me. And I don't bore easily. They should get some kind of awards for that...boring me in a Godzilla film with Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe takes some actual skill, I think."

The other downside is thee was not enough of the main man Godzilla himself. The film focused more on the life of the navy seal and his wife at home in San Fran. I also found it fascinating how the American army turns up and takes over a Japanese nuclear plant claiming this was now an International incident, what about the rest of the world, UN, British Army/navy, are they not concerned?

In the original Godzilla he was a good guy, but I guess its better to be bad, not all his villains were bad, they just started out that way. Remember Baby Godzilla, that was really funny. Since Jurrasic Park, and Lucasfilm, the computerized graphics are amazing, and also Amblin Entertainment, Im sure that Lucas and Spielberg are still working, and will always live on just as Randy Rhoads will, love Garry Hixon, thank you."

","Godzilla 2 is just like a normal movie with poor graphics and poor camera and a non biological. I am saying non-biological because the Godzilla 1 we had seen has no power of electromagnetic radiation.It only feeds on genetic food.But in this movie there is electromagnetic power to it.This has completely disappointed.And also there is no greatness of man.Since the Godzilla itself has done all the work.Then what is the use of man power?Man has done nothing.Usage of firing by the army is less than the expected.Coming to the graphics it was very disgusting.Godzilla was not shown clearly and of less duration.Even the anti Godzilla called MUTOS were not shown clearly.The movie is full of darkness.No scene to scene relations.The 3/10 rating i have given is for the ""missile concept"",The ""POWER OFF DUE TO RADIATION"",and finally ""a Small sentiment scene in the beginning of the movie""."

","It seemed about halfway through the movie the director knew it was a turd and stopped caring. Loved the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" reference. The black dude hugs his family and you hear James Stewart cry, ""Mary!"" Super cheesy. And what was up with the ""2001"" music scene? You know, the music when Dave sees the crazy colors. It was during the S.F. monster battle. Talk about awkward. Also, how many ""big monster stares down puny human"" scenes did they stuff into this one. That money shot is so overused, one is too many. How about the ships escorting Godzilla to S.F.? ""Hey, that monster could fart and blow us out of the water, so lets cruise next to it at about 50 feet off starboard."" Lol, I could go on and on. Funny for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The most tragic part is that all the main actors could act and they were given nothing to work with. The human element of this movie just got in the way of the eye candy. And it could have used a lot more eye candy. Too much human, not enough monster. As a matter of fact, since the plot for the monsters was actually good, I sat there thinking that it could have been good if there was no human plot at all. It also didn't help that the Cranston family's last name was Brody. If you're gonna draw attention to that monster movie, you'd better deliver."

","I remember seeing the 1998 version of Godzilla as a kid and years later after seeing it again, it was a terrible film. It was more focused on destruction with cheesy acting and terrible CGI and the design of Godzilla was more a dinosaur then what it was back in 1954. This version is better then the 1998 'adaptation'. It has great build up, tense and dramatic moments, a good storyline and back story. The characters are good too, maybe not too memorable though, but the actors did well in the film. <br/><br/>The visuals are fantastic of the monsters (e.g - Godzilla) sticking close to the original design of what the Japanese films were like, in fact this fight scenes in the movie remind me of the old school Godzilla films and makes me want to watch them. I will admit there is a lack of fights between Godzilla and the monster but its all made up by the third act. <br/><br/>It's better then the 1998 version and I've seen that film, as previously mentioned before, and it's terrible. The 2014 version is better."

","There is so much unknown in this Universe. As a civilization, we are capable of observing phenomena light years away yet barely know what's under our feet. With rather peculiar yet impactful trembles of unknown origin near nuclear reactors in Japan, lives are lost, the region is evacuated and people's lives are turned upside down. This is no simple matter. Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) realizes the dismissal of quite disturbing events that are apocalyptic in nature and works extensively to prevent another catastrophe. <br/><br/>Being the only individual privy to sensational information (i.e. immediately ominous futures), it's hard to fully convince others you are sane. With the stage set for a man to challenge society's greatest conflict, Godzilla is sure to impress...but it falls short. <br/><br/>Whether it's the human-helping Godzilla, cliché reunions or poor dialogue, this film starts strong but deteriorates afterwards. What begins as an interesting scientific investigation results in an effort of the world (Americans more specifically) fighting to restore balance. The build-up of an intriguing inquiry of a man who lost everything ends up in a shallow battle.<br/><br/>I must say I was excited watching Godzilla but was sadly disappointed as the movie progressed."
"glakhmed","9","3","9","15 May 2014"," Very good, could have been better.
","Even though I marked this as ""Spoiler,"" I'm going to make it as spoiler free as possible.<br/><br/>First off, I think this was probably more of an 8.5 than a 9, but I think an 8 is probably too low. You have probably already heard, and maybe voiced some, complaints about Godzilla's physique after viewing some trailers and seeing some movie stills. Well, after seeing the movie, yeah, ole boy needs to go on a lil diet. That's a minor thing though. Overall he looks amazing.<br/><br/>What I felt was the biggest drawback to this movie was that there was too much story trying to be told. Yeah, stinkin' humans messin' up Godzilla's flick. The movie jumped around a lot, and it wasn't just that Godzilla was passing through here or a little back story there, it seemed like there were too many major plot lines trying to be played out in too many locations.<br/><br/>Another drawback was that it felt like I was being teased way too often. Build up, build up, build up, switch scenes and another plot line. It's one thing to build up to a crescendo, but when you build for 105 minutes in a 120 minute movie, you kinda feel like the tension is just going to die off again at any moment.<br/><br/>SMALL SPOILER: It was kind of nice to see a return of the blue breath, but to be honest, the one thing that the 1998 Godzilla movie did really well IMO was the clear breath. You knew it was there, you could see the distortion in the air and the resulting destruction, but it seemed more real to not be a blue beam shooting out of his mouth. I have to admit though, when his tail started to light up, I about lost it!<br/><br/>BIGGER SPOILER: On the topic of the breath, isn't it radioactive? Don't these MUTOs feed off radioactive stuff? Wouldn't Godzilla's breath have fed them? Hmm...<br/><br/>OK, so for such a high rating, I know I've had a lot of criticism, but the movie was really good, I think he just tried to put in too much story. The acting was great; Oscar worthy compared to the 1998 one (aside from Jean Reno, he's good). The effects of course were great and the action, when there was action, was heart pounding.<br/><br/>A really solid effort and well worth the money. But next time, maybe remember who the star of the movie is?"

","Godzilla is by far one of the most entertaining films that came out in 2014. The film has its great moments and also is a great way to reboot the 1954 Japanese film, but this time a more visually acceptable experience. The various departments of this film is rated as the follows: <br/><br/>Story/Screenplay: The story of the film is an engaging one and makes the viewer connect to the different characters of the film and also feel their emotions. The screenplay is also good, as the writer was successful in making the audience involved in this gripping tale. Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Cast: Bryan Cranston was a show stealer in this film and those of you who have seen him in the show Breaking Bad know how good of an actor he is. Aaron Taylor Johnson was good in his part, but since his role was that of an army officer, you cant expect much expressions from him. The supporting cast also were good in their roles. Rating: 9/10 <br/><br/>Effects: The CGI of this film was incredible and it technically did blow my mind. Even the sound effects were brilliant, kudos to both the CGI and the sound department. IMAX 3D is recommended. Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Background Score: The background score was also a good supplement in the film as it was appropriate to the scenes and it was composed nicely, based on the situation of the film. Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Direction:Finally, the director had put all the pieces of the puzzle and built a great picture out of it. The film was executed very well, in such a way that the pace builds up from the starting till the end. Rating: 9/10 <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10. It is a good movie for entertainment, and it is also a great visual treat, preferably in IMAX 3D."

The plot revolves around wanting to release ALL kaiju to ""reset"" the earth using, and I kid you not, the ""radiation left behind"" to promote ""growth.""
Just absurd, seeing as how No One can live in radiation dense areas. Would have been better if the protagonists just wanted to wipe humanity off the map. But, of course, it would not have fit the arc of divorce and parents struggling with the loss of a child...
And Godzilla? Well, it does make an appearance, but honestly- Mothra is a more likable and better designed character.

The main character (hero) drives me Nutts. He is present at every single incident in the movie, he is given so much authority as every batch of soldiers took his orders and were asking his opinions, also high rank officials are even looking up to him explaining their plans to him and what not. The worst thing was the main character was the only one who is doing epic stuff in the movie and all the soldiers just got vanished or were getting killed by the giant bugs, also the main actor is always present at every single incident, like he is a superman and can fly in the blink of an eye and, boom!

"guillermobosque","9","2","5","4 December 2014"," Godzilla is a slow-burn film with a huge emphasis on human perspective, and quite similar to Gareth Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"".
","Summary: Godzilla is a slow-burn film with a huge emphasis on human perspective, and quite similar to Gareth Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"". 91/100 (A-)<br/><br/>It makes me happy that Edwards directed this movie. I liked the way he did not show Godzilla throughout the film, that was very clever and suspenseful. This film felt very similar to Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"". I highly recommend you to watch ""Monsters"" before watching this film. I have read a lot of negative comments from the audience, it is sad that people do not appreciate the awesomeness of Gareth's work. Godzilla (2014) is not your average blockbuster, and the best thing about it is that it does not rely on the special effects. It focuses more on the human perspective and cares about its characters.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a pretty good job, but his character was somewhat boring and I would be okay if he died. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, even though I did not feel 100% engaged with her character, I still cared about her. Bryan Cranston was terrific in his role, his performance gave me the chills. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins were excellent too. Also, there were some little roles in the film that were very effective: the bus driver in the bridge sequence, and a little girl in the tsunami scene. This movie has a few flaws and one of them is that spends too much of its running time developing its characters.<br/><br/>It is a film with a huge emphasis on realism and human perspective. It requires a lot of patience, you have to wait an hour to finally see Godzilla, and that is not a bad thing. The movie has a bunch of exciting moments throughout. There are a lot of people saying that there was not enough of Godzilla in the movie. The big guy had 12 minutes of screen time, and that was fine to me. I left the movie theater completely satisfied and happy because the payoff was huge to me. I was on the edge of my seat during the last 20 minutes. The third act was a huge payoff, a mind-blowing spectacle of dazzlingly special effects and an epic battle between the three monsters.<br/><br/>I saw it on 3D and it was an awesome experience. The visual effects and the sound mixing were just breathtaking. Just imagine all the work that was required to make the design of the MUTOs and Godzilla. Gareth Edwards and his team clearly appreciate the monsters. Moving on, the fight sequences were bold, exciting and the CGI looked so neat. These monsters are masterfully designed, and they look scary as hell to me. I am so glad that the trailer did not show too much of the final act. Also, the musical score by Alexandre Desplat was great and fits with the tone of the film. The tsunami scene includes one of my favorite tracks.<br/><br/>Another strength of the movie was the beautiful camera work. Edwards wants you to feel as if you are right there seeing a monster through your eyes, with his camera movements. I felt like I was into the movie. Also, there was a scene that reminded me of the 9/11 attacks. It was very short and many people missed it, but it is one of my favorite moments in the movie. It was just a plane crashing into a building and it looked quite real. Overall, Godzilla is a slow-burn spectacle with a huge emphasis on human perspective and empathy, very similar to Edwards' previous work ""Monsters"". Despite a few dull characters, it delivers exciting action, stunning camera work and a payoff. (A-)"
"pc95","4","2","5","1 November 2014"," Quite Bad
","Do yourself a favor and watch Pacific Rim again or for the first time, whose creators at least know how to focus a story correctly. I haven't watched the 90's Godzilla, but this can't be much better. Godzilla needs to be about Godzilla, and this pod of pond scum movie certainly is not. Filmmakers cop-out in trying to make some sort of human element diluting the watered out movie anyhow. As clichéd and done in dozens of other movies, the characters and scientists are idiots. The battles are sparse, and the finale ones are difficult to see thanks to poor lighting. Godzilla was hardly in the movie too. This is a steamer. A failure and dud devoid of concept or intelligence - a big budget bloated floaty."
"IamJeffHolt","4","2","5","21 October 2014"," Godzilla...I think.
","Well...I think I want to write a review over Godzilla (2014) but I can't be for sure if this is the movie that I saw. This movie received 4 out of 10 the four is strictly for...3 being for affects and 1 for Bryan Cranston. That is all i can give on this movie. I couldn't see the rest. For one I only saw Godzilla himself for about 3 minutes of the movie and that's if some kind of lighting came up for me to see him. Most of the fighting takes place at night and I think they forgot to hire a lighting grip or there was an actual monster that destroyed all the lights and we couldn't see him. I had to watch the movie on my laptop and I kept on turning up the brightness only to keep on seeing that i had it already as bright as it can go. So as far as the fight between Godzilla and the matu's, i didn't get to see most of it because the film was so dark. I only got to enjoy the dorsal fins of Godzilla while it was in the day time when he was swimming, then at the end of the movie when he stood up. (sorry for ruining that for you, I guess). But I wish I could help you further with plot, but there wasn't one. I wish i could tell you the acting was good. Ken Wantanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, and Bryan Crantson, especially Bryan were good. But the main character's best performance was when his face was covered in mud and he had to act through it. Other than that Kristen Stewart had more facial expressions then this guy. I don't fully understand the whole breeding thing. How the deuce hole did it happen actually. They throw a line in there to help out saying ""back when these creatures were made and the world was a lot more radioactive then it is today."" - That is suppose to help us with the breeding. And why are we hiding this thing in a cave somewhere and not no this is what is attacking the rest of the planet. This movie was just a mess. Not much to it. I'm pretty sure if I could of actually seen it I would be happier, but, the lighting was as good as Aliens vs. Predator Requiem. Not good at all."
"BenignPillows","5","2","5","18 October 2014"," Flawed. Very.
","My advice for this movie is: 1. Watch the first half hour, which is when it seems promising. Bryan Cranston being one of the reasons. After that, simply fast forward through all the scenes that have humans only, but watch the monster scenes. <br/><br/>2. Turn off your brain.<br/><br/>The special effects here are GORGEOUS. Godzilla is beautifully brought to life, the Mutos, well, less so, but the monster interaction is actually kind of interesting. So is some of the monster-human scenes. A certain lying-on-train-tracks scene comes to mind. Scene has no logic, sure, but it's memorable (see point 2). <br/><br/>The human interaction, on the other hand, is completely uninteresting. I seriously wonder if the director/screenwriters know the meaning of the word character development?? I mean, no character has any arc. Cranston may be the exception, but sadly leaves the movie early. Him aside, they are all clichés. Good actors, mostly, wasted. As characters, the monsters are more interesting!<br/><br/>The storyline is riddled with plot holes and just...jumbled. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) tells his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) to stay put in the city. A big mistake, apparently. Then she basically has no purpose for the rest of the movie. We get quick glimpses of her now and then, roaming around the city. She doesn't even motivate the hero's actions in any way. He doesn't look for her or anything. She does nothing and nothing is done to her. <br/><br/>The nuclear warhead is put on a.. train. Okay. Then nobody considers the idea that maybe the nuke might serve as bait *before* they reached the ship? And get the MUTOs to attack the train?? <br/><br/>Later Ford Brody comes in as ""the only one who can serve the day"" and disarm the bomb. Aha. So that's why they made him a bomb specialist. But no! Because the lid is jammed! They can't open the bomb! Sorry, Ford, plan B. I get that they wanted to unconventionally make Godzilla the saviour instead of ""one man"", but lets at least have a good reason to leave a plot point like this in a split second.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is miscast. I don't know what happened. He was okay in Kickass. Watching him opposite Bryan Cranston, though, I felt sorry for him. He was left to carry the movie, and couldn't do it in any way, shape or form. Enough said."
"AustinMTorres","9","2","5","14 October 2014"," One of the better monster films in recent years.
","I've seen a majority of the blockbuster films this summer, and I can easily say that Godzilla is one of the best films that came out. I really try to understand why it's receiving lack-luster reviews, and I honestly think that some people are either spoiled by non-stop action films like Pacific Rim and The Avengers, or are too stupid to understand the conventions of a true monster film. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but a lot of criticisms I've read are extremely hypocritical and downright ignorant. For example, the ""There's not enough Godzilla"" complaint. Look at the classic monster films that everyone loves and clearly inspired this film. Jaws, Alien, and Jurassic Park all show less than twenty minutes of screen time for their respective creatures. There are shots in the new Godzilla which obviously try to pay tribute to those films, so it should be clear that would be the direction of the film. And as for the well-crafted trailers, you see even less Godzilla, so it's not surprising at all that we wouldn't see him as much in the film. The scene in Hawaii with the beautiful pan-up of Godzilla which immediately cuts away from the action was one of the funniest gags I've seen in a while, though I can see less patient viewers getting upset there. As for the ""Not enough Bryan Cranston"" complaint, I'm calling some b.s. right there. The incredibly disappointing X-MEN: Days of Future Past was critically acclaimed by almost everyone, yet no one complains of how they wasted the talents of Sir Ian McKellan, Peter Dinklage, Halle Berry, and many others in roles that had less screen-time than Cranston in Godzilla. Even Dawn of the Planet of the Apes had the same problem not having enough Gary Oldman, but Godzilla is the only film being called out for it. Now I'm biased. Godzilla is right up my alley. I love a restrained, almost Spielbergian approach the Godzilla shows. When Godzilla IS on screen, he commands it like he truly is the King of the Monsters. Godzilla also isn't a perfect film despite my love for it. It's clear that it went through massive rewrites. There are tired clichés of military trying to shoot Godzilla with guns, random dog in peril, teapot whistling to signify tension, and so forth. But as many clichés as it has, it also breaks them. No other film make would cut away right before an epic fight. At this moment, I can't think of any film that kills it's strongest supporting character in the first half hour. And that Halo Jump scene is just incredible. The direction is pretty good, especially being Edward's first blockbuster. Desplat's musical score is outstanding with ripping horns, blaring trombones, and shrieking trumpets. Obviously the visual effects are outstanding, though the darkness makes it hard to see a lot of the action. Overall, I would give this film a 7.8 out of 10. However, being a huge fan of Godzilla growing up, I'm bumping my rating to a 9. Like I said, I'm biased. Also, when Godzilla unleashes his atomic breath, well, that made me extremely happy.<br/><br/>Direction- 4 out of 5 Acting- 3 out of 5 Music- 5 out of 5 Screenplay- 3 out of 5 Cinematography- 3 out of 5 Visual Effects- 5 out of 5 Sound Design- 5 out of 5 Art Direction- 4 out of 5 Pacing- 4 out of 5 (I love a slow monster flick) Tone- 3 out of 5 Overall 39 out 50. 39/50= .78*10= 7.8"

","Where was the story? <br/><br/>To be honest I expected an average film with plenty of clichés but what I got surpassed my worst estimation. The characters came straight out of ""my big book of film characters"", the story, or what little plot passed for one, dragged interminably and there were more ""Hollywood moments"" than I could count. By Hollywood moments I mean liberties taken with the plot or with reality. I'll give just two examples.<br/><br/>1. The Japanese civilian authority fails so naturally the American military takes over whilst still in Japan. The Japanese military are not to be seen.<br/><br/>2. Ships follow each other and Godzilla mere yards apart and cross an ocean in hours. <br/><br/>OK, with any Godzilla movie you have to take some liberties with reality to even make a movie at all but this one just sticks it's middle finger up to such cares leaving you looking at the failures rather than the story. That the story is so poorly told only makes that easier. Frankly films that treat me as an idiot only highlight their own shortcomings. To work, an action or sci-fi film must take any liberties with at least a modicum of plausibility to leave the viewer engaged with the plot rather than grasping with the liberties. The last Godzilla movie was a vastly better affair."

","When the Teaser Trailer came out, I've got hyped, it was dark and serious, it was 2 minutes goodness. Then the official trailer came out, it was even better, Bryan did the voice over really well in the trailer. On May 16th 2014, I went to the cinema to see Godzilla, 2 hours later, I felt like it could of been better. My problems with this film is that Godzilla gets 10 minutes and 3 seconds of screen-time in a 2 hour film, the reason for not enough Godzilla because the film focuses on the MUTO monsters too much and Ford Brody, In a film called Godzilla I expected to see Godzilla most of the time then the MUTO creatures, it should be the MUTO that has the less screen-time not Godzilla, it would of been better if the MUTO gets a build up. I would like to point out that when Godzilla arrives it cuts away from Godzilla and goes to a different thing which bothers me a lot, when he roared at the Hawaii airport I was expecting a fight but it cuts to Elizabeth Olsen and her son watching TV, yes we saw a little fight on the TV but it doesn't last that long 12 seconds or more? it doesn't happen once it does it all the time! there's Godzilla *CUTS* it doesn't stop! the first time Godzilla comes around the 55 minute mark we don't see much of him so all this time we've sitting our butts on seats waiting for Godzilla and we don't get a prize for it!?. Arron Tyler Johnson didn't do well as the main character, it would be fine if he was a side character, a main character that is boring and is just there to disarm the nuke. Elizabeth Olsen was the kind of character that is the main character in the city, we follow her instead of a bunch of other people. In fact all characters but Bryan Cranstan didn't do well. The CGI is amazing, there's nothing really wrong about it. I know I'm going on and on about Godzilla but isn't that what we wanted to see? right? I will have to say though that the new Godzilla design is my favorite out of all Godzilla suits. The music is great, it suits the film good. Godzilla's roar was making the speakers in the theater at the max volume, it was making the floor shaking, nice feature there. What I hope for the sequels that Godzilla at least gets 20 minutes of screen time or more and let the other monsters have build ups please? no cutting away from Godzilla, maybe for the other monsters. and better cast. Please please...please respect my opinions and mind yours to, people need to give honest feedback, don't attack the haters just for hating the film, just let them be it please, stop defending the film and put up with it! I also like to point out that you DON'T have to follow the rules of other Godzilla films, its optional choice!!!<br/><br/>4/10 - Barely Godzilla action in a film called Godzilla!!!"

Silly pretext for Godzilla in the first place. The Nuclear reactor setting at the start of the book pointless and lacks any sort of real emotion. <br/><br/>The Japanese/US link never really explained as to why the US army is managing the Godzilla 'eggs'. So many plot holes it's unreal. I think what sinks the film is really a lack of direction. The action scenes are confusing and mostly uninspiring. The monsters themselves are fantastic. Really well imagined, but the fight scenes are mostly boring without any sort of real drama."
"nick-sultana","8","2","5","2 September 2014"," The 'King of the Monsters' Returns to its Roots
","Back in 1954, Japanese filmmakers made a film called Godzilla, it was a move that explores the devastating consequences of nuclear effects on nature and symbolically features a monster figure that would not only bring terror to movie audiences, but it would create an iconic character for the world to love and remember. Being that this year commemorates the 60th anniversary of Godzilla, Hollywood filmmakers thought it was time to bring 'the big guy' back to modern audiences (though it had been done in 1998 with the dreadful and utterly horrible adaptation). It was placed with high expectations that it would be better and closer to its original roots, and filmmaker Gareth Evans (Monsters) delivers the expectations with full quality. <br/><br/>The storyline begins with a flashback, showing how 2 scientists discovering an enormous find in the Philippines before realising that once of its subjects has hatched and fled to sea land. Where else in Janjira a Nuclear Plant suffers an explosion and major radiation leak, causing a massive loss in lives and destruction of Janjira with claims of quarantine and evacuation for the area. This is shown to be a major life-changing event for Joe Brody (Breaking Bad stat Bryan Cranston) and his son Ford (Kick-Ass and Savages star Aaron Taylor –Johnson). Years drift by and both father and son have gone separate ways, Ford is a family man coming hum from his military service and Joe becoming an 'cover-up' investigator, believing that the events in Janjira lead to something much worse to fear and that it was a cover-up. Convincing Ford of this truth, they go to the quarantined Janjira only to discover that scientist Ishiro (Ken Watanabe) is leading a study mission on the found chrysalis that is similar to the opening find but it appears to have awaken and appear destructive. What follows after is an epic race against time that pushes the humans to fight against this and realise the truth of what was found in the Philippines may be the only hope of survival.<br/><br/>What makes this reboot to be so amazing that the fact that it's much much better than the 1998 version that its darker, intense and epic. The storyline for the film was indeed entertaining but some may complain that the character development wasn't strong enough but I personally felt that how the characters developed was fine by me and there was some minor detail in the monster's side. The performances on the other hand were all superb, making them believable and realistic with emotion of the destruction that occurs in the story. Cranston here is still strong just after finishing Breaking Bad and it seems like he wants an Oscar nomination in the future. Themes to the story too are really an eye-opener, one of them being the theme of Man Vs. Nature. Others complain too that Godzilla's appearance is only half but from what I could see it was done excellent. Fans will be waiting for the epic monster fights to appear full on but there are only teases of it in the middle of the plot, but no disappointment will occur when we are given the full fight of the climatic battle of good vs. bad. <br/><br/>The visual effects here are all top-notch and are given state of the art detail. The detailing to Godzilla and the other monsters that appear here as well are so much like the original version from 1954 but in terms of the size of Godzilla, he is REALLY MASSIVE and this has been considered to be the biggest version of the monster in the franchise history. Covered in scars, scales and loud roar (using the original sound wave but re-mixing it to be a big boom) this is definitely proof that Godzilla has the potential to be a strong contender for Visual Effects awards. It is up to the excellence of Pacific Rim, Smaug from The Hobbit trilogy, Transformers and even The Avengers standards.<br/><br/>The Music score here is very impressive, being written and composed by French composer Alexandre Desplat (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 1 and 2, Argo and The King's Speech). Godzilla's theme is so much like the very original tune, where the tone of horror and devastation is much like a fearful sound. <br/><br/>Overall, Godzilla is a sight to behold for the fans and movie audiences. Although a bit of background knowledge of the franchise is essential but being a reboot it will hopefully set a promising franchise that will indeed earn a lot of acclaim and praise. A fun watch as well if you had enjoyed Pacific Rim and King Kong."

","Here i am again, reviewing another title recently watched. I don't review every movie: only the memorable ones and the ones that deserve a critic. This one was a memorable and deserves a critic but...for how disappointed i was. Godzilla 2014 is not what one expects after having seen the 1998 version. Perhaps biased from that movie i must say this one was a surprisingly disappointing story and some acting which i didn't appreciate either.<br/><br/>Sure there was action, cgi effects, and the story which one doesn't expect, but i liked it too little. Giants battling each other? Pacific Rim does justice to that. This godzilla...mmmmh....mhhhh.<br/><br/>Certainly don't watch it on small screen, is the truthful baseline i'll give u, then if you want to spend for theather ticket, well,...i'll be curious to know what u thought after.<br/><br/>Over and out!"

","The acting was terrible for the cast they had, I didn't watch a movie for military, everyone including I who wanted to watched it for Godzilla who was only in it for a total of probably 6-7 minutes of a two hour movie. I will admit I loved the scene when he comes out and you see his feet in the airport (only Cinematography I cared for). The dialog was diarrhea. For the music I think it was done at wrong spots sometimes but it was well done. The ending blew, you find out he's immortal and everyone is happy. Also my biggest thing that made me mad watching it, was pitch black during some of the most important scenes. How am I suppose to even remotely enjoy a movie when I'm trying to see the climax scenes of the movie and they aren't visible? (And I watched it on Blu-Ray) The best thing was the airport scene and that was shown in the trailer..."
"tmf084","7","2","5","29 August 2014"," Inspired by the original ...
","Overall I would say it's a solid movie - not epic or as good as it could be, but enjoyable if you don't dislike disaster movies on principle. The part I liked most was that it leans quite a bit on the early movies by giving Godzilla a character and depicting him as something with purpose. This allowed them also to play a bit with the question of who is in charge, man or nature and use it as a subtle theme that is driven to the obvious conclusion. What I didn't like about it was the overall pacing and the special effects. The first half is really good and had a good mixture of story, Godzilla and top-notch acting. But the 2nd half contains too many elements of the usual disaster movies with a dragged out climax that failed to deliver because of rather poor CGI work. It could be that I'm spoiled from other productions but too much of the scenes were put during night time and you had a hard time to see what's going on, also the CGI during daylight lacked depth in texture and integration into the environment. With a bit more story and utilizing the actors more in the second half, it would have distracted me from the shortcomings and made them less obvious - that's why I think it could have been better but it is still an entertaining movie."
"dmazonakis","3","2","5","28 August 2014"," Not entertained...
","For a movie rated close to 7 out of 10 it was certainly a major let down. Too little Godzilla for a Godzilla movie, overly dramatic protagonists and, what is worse, a ridiculous plot! The story was expected to be simple (let's face it, one would expect good visual effects, at least one fearsome monster, protagonists who would rise up to the challenge, devastation and either a happy - NOT CHEESY! - ending or an apocalypse), but instead it was rather confusing and off-putting. I had a feeling during the entire movie that things happened ""just because"" the movie had to somehow end the way it did. There was no natural flow of events. There is too little explanation about what happens. Hence it is difficult to be part of the experience and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>In a few words, this movie does not qualify as an entertaining action movie about a legendary monster. The real battle will be about yourself trying to watch all 2 hours of it. Good luck with that.<br/><br/>A generous 3/10 from me just because Godzilla looked like the original monster and because I have seen worse."
"bogymel","2","2","5","24 August 2014"," Eye rape
","This movie has everything... It tries to combine some cinematography techniques in a the most uninspired way possible. It seems like it tries to be some sort of The Dark Night (without the awesome Bat-Man and the Villain) with some sort of Cloverfield. The combination is so badly put together that it will make you cringe. <br/><br/>It looks like those in charge of this movie smoked some weed, snorted some coke, sat on the toilet and thought hmm... how do we sabotage this movie? Uh, I know, let's show 5 minutes or so of monster-monster action, let's use as few words as possible, let's create tasteless, odorless and colorless characters and no one would care if they were chewed by Godzilla, spat out for the lack of taste and finally swallowed and digested by those whatever the hell they are monsters and last but not least let's use a lot of military stuff... everybody just loooves military stuff... boom boom here's your movie.<br/><br/>It has so many plot holes it hurts. It's unbelievable that that huge bunch of people that took part in the making of this movie had all the IQ of an empty bucket. <br/><br/>It is an insult to the public. It is an insult to this fine art that is cinematography. It is a waste of money and resources. It is a waste of Bryan Cranston's talent. I believe he begged them to kill him and get him out of the nightmare.<br/><br/>There you have it. Hollywood is getting worse every year and makes a mockery of every movie subject in existence. They should be ashamed of themselves."

Luckily I changed my mind and had these 120 awesome minutes with this movie.<br/><br/>Of course you cannot blame other people's taste but for me Godzilla had almost all that these kinds of movies should contain.

","I love monsters. I love sci-fi. I love horror. I love destruction movie. I love epic movie. And I love Godzilla, the monster itself. In those expectation, Godzilla was supposed to be my epic movie, second only to Superman-Batman.<br/><br/>But, not going into spoiler, this movie is just way too dark. Not in the movie tone. Literally. Dark. Darker than Dark Knight. Darker than almost horror movie, bar The Blair Witch Project.So dark that I almost yelled. While I understand maybe the movie makers wanted it to be fearsome and maybe did not want to show some brutality in it, the movie was too dark for audiences. We almost could not tell what was going on. This is a movie, not a radio show.<br/><br/>Also, when I was expecting an epic monster fight scene, it suddenly zoomed into a TV news showing a glimpse of that fight. Now I came to conclusion that they wanted to save budget in the visual effect department.<br/><br/>This movie has the potential to be a great experience. Just if, the director did not shy in buying some lights or candles. Again, way too dark."
"bennyhagen","5","2","5","17 August 2014"," Very little Godzilla for a movie called Godzilla.
","It's clear why Gareth Edwards was brought on board and his efforts are appreciated. Godzilla wants to be a serious movie but unfortunately the script just doesn't cut it. Dialog is thin, the characters have little to do besides worrying and being startled. Brian Cranston's mini-role is a trap, Godzillas screen time doesn't even match that of the malevolent creatures, making him become a supporting character in his own show, the action movie this promises to be never really happens and the enigmatic shots of tailtips and monster hips are really pointless and annoying 40 minutes after having exposed the creatures in their entirety. I do see a tendency of slow betterment in American cinema, but Hollywood really needs to hire better scriptwriters at this point."
"ILoveFilm1998","8","2","5","5 August 2014"," ""Godzilla"" Movie Review
","""Godzilla"" is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is set in the present day, fifteen years after the unearthing of two chrysalises in a mine in the Philippines. From the pods come two giant radiation-eating creatures, known as ""MUTOs"", which cause great damage in Japan, Hawaii and the western United States. Their awakening also stirs a much larger, destructive, ancient alpha predator known as Godzilla, whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. It stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston.<br/><br/>First off, let's address the elephant in the room. Godzilla lack of screen time, and having more focus on the human characters rather the titular character. Personally, I'm rather fond of this decision. I appreciate that the film wanted to build tension, and have the audience wanting for those glorious monster fights. It's not often that I see from most modern blockbusters, to actually build anticipation and value subtlety over shoving special effects down people's throats.<br/><br/>Now for those that was wanting more, I can understand where you are coming. Would of it be nice if the movie have more awesome monster fights? Of course! However, I think Gareth Edwards made the smart choice of not going all out on the first round. If that was the case, the sequels would have trouble to be able to top themselves without being too silly, and I certainly don't want to see silly in Godzilla again. When compare to ""Pacific Rim"", a movie that embraces and indulges in the fun goofiness potential of giant monster battles, and that is awesome. However, this film was going for a gritty and realistic route. Being restrained with it's monster presentation, and making the climax all the more memorable.<br/><br/>The cast is great, with Byran Cranston, Ken Watanable, and David Strathairn, and Elizabeth Olsen. However, it's time to address the second elephant in the room. Aaron Taylor-Johnson performance. And to be honest again, I actually like his performance and the character of Ford Bordy. It because I'm been starved of noble, brave and just overall good heroes in my movies of late. While not the most compelling character in the film, Taylor-Johnson does show human emotion in his performance, and I was rooting for him to get back to his family. However I agree that Bryan Cranston character is a lot more tragic and interesting, and Ken Watanable role, while interesting, needed more depth. They are great in the film, but they feel a little bit sidelined too much.<br/><br/>From the technical side of ""Godzilla"", they are absolutely fantastic. Not just the CGI, but Gareth Edwards directs the movie extremely well, with shots that are breathtaking. At points, my mouth dropped. Beautiful to say the least. Edwards style of shooting a film was very unique, and he manages to bring a human perspective on these creatures. Doing that makes the monsters feel huge, and their massive destructive capabilities. I also love how these monsters feel like animals. They're not trying to cause chaos, but trying to survive, which adds to the movie's realistic tone. And the score by Alexandre Desplat is intense and added a lot to the action.<br/><br/>Overall, I say ""Godzilla"" was really good. I appreciate the approach to it's monster presentation, which I found refreshing compared to a good number of monster flicks. I like the characters, and the technical aspects were marvelous to say the least. It opens the door to a sequel very well, and I am really looking forward to. I say check it out, but understanding you not going to get ""Pacific Rim"", but a character-driven narrative instead, which is fine with me."
"lloyd_r1993","5","2","5","28 July 2014"," ""I'd pay to see the trailers than the actual film again!""
","When the teasers, trailers and TV spots were first released, I was nothing short of amazed and chomping at the bit to watch this much anticipated summer blockbuster. I'm not exaggerating when I say the previews were absolutely epic! Bryan Cranston and the big man (Godzilla) showcase a promising spectacle and I thought surely this will deliver. <br/><br/>If anything, this type of film is to be enjoyed only in cinemas, but to be honest if I watched it anywhere else I would have disliked it even more than I already do. Gareth Edward's Godzilla doesn't deliver. In fact, I'd pay to see the trailers than the actual film again!<br/><br/>The actual Godzilla monster is impressing. He's frightening and a whole lot bigger and taller than the Godzilla of 1998. His roar was the recognisably iconic roar that we all know and love to hear. Its overwhelmingly heart dropping presence was one thing that kept me watching the film. Visually, he looked really convincing and that's one thing I praise the film for - its visual effects were incredible. The skydive scene was a real apocalyptic spectacle. <br/><br/>However, one thing I noticed straight away from the film, was that there were certain shots and actions featured in the trailers, which I thought were brilliant, were replaced or missing in the actual film. E.g. The general's big speech to his troops before the skydive; ""Gentlemen you are being sent it by a halo jump! Now I realise not all of you have had hands-on experience... frankly none of us have faced a situation quite like this one before. But I would not be asking any one of you to take this leap, if I did not have complete faith in your ability to succeed. Your courage will never be more needed than it is today."" <br/><br/>That is one hell of a speech to give to someone, who is about to put their life on the line against a monster as tall as the Burj Khalifa! Yet it was absent from the final cut. This is just a small portion of what I disliked from the film but it's certainly pivotal to my overall opinion. It wouldn't of hurt to add a little more dramatic tension to the film by including brilliant cinematic features such as this, but hey!<br/><br/>Another thing that frustrated me was how early Bryan Cranston's character was killed off as well as being killed off in the first place! He was the ONLY character worth watching. We have the luxury of enjoying Cranston's brilliant heart felt performance for a short amount of time, approximately 10-20 minutes. That is irritatingly premature. I'd go as far as saying he carried an equally powerful presence in the narrative as Godzilla did, but we never get to witness him and Godzilla on screen simultaneously, which is a real shame. So when he dies, so does a big human portion of the film too. I for one would have loved to have seen him lead the narrative throughout, but instead we were stuck with a lack-luster Aaron Johnson. I was very disappointed with his performance. His character wasn't interesting and hard to engage with, purely because Aaron doesn't give enough raw emotion and conviction as Bryan did to his character. <br/><br/>I kid you not when I say I actually started to fall asleep at some point during the film for a short while. The plot lacks quite a bit of weight to it, which rendered me to have 'heavy eyes' syndrome. I guess you'll be surprised to know that I actually went to see this film TWICE with different people. I suppose I was hoping I'd actually like it if I saw it at a cinema again..."

They needed to show the MUTOs in the process of wrecking cities and millions dying, instead of just the ruined buildings .. even if only for a minute or 2 here and there .. hundreds of thousands dying at least .. This movie needed this kind of horror to drive home the end of the world stakes in this film .. Yes . the atomic breath was awesome .. and the last fight was great .. but that still doesn't excuse the imperfections .. Better than 1998 version 50% to 20% on a percentage scale, but so what?!

","If you are one of the people who say that this film isn't up to par with other blockbusters, then I have serious concerns for the future of Hollywood. First off, many people say this film is bad because they themselves lack patience. I praise this film for that. It brought me right back to the first time I watched Jaws. The anticipation of seeing the creature was just killing me. The constant teasing of the title character throughout the film was perfect. Second, when people say that Godzilla is barely in it, they make it seem like nothing is happening when he's off screen. The MUTOs keep a balance between the humans and Gojira. Speaking of the MUTOs I've also heard the complaint that they have nothing to do with Japanese culture. While I understand that Godzilla originates from Japan and the terrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this is an American interpretation of the character. That is not a requirement for this interpretation. I've also heard that the 98 version is better than this version. While Godzilla isn't on screen for very long, it is better than the 98 which lacked the character entirely. You can argue that the 98 Zilla is an American interpretation of Godzilla. But Zilla lacks certain characteristics of the Japanese version to even be considered the American Godzilla. Now I won't defend the acting of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. Taylor-Johnson was stoic and mostly boring, but what can you expect from a script written for a marine character. And Olsen really didn't contribute much to the film other than the dramatic reunion at the end. Offsetting that would be Bryan Cranston's powerful and driving acting and Ken Wantanabe's Gojira obsessed scientist character. While I will admit that there are some stale and cheesy moments that isn't enough to justify calling it a bad film. The good definitely outweigh the bad, and I hope to see The King of the Monsters again in American theaters."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>The opening credits are absolute perfection, the intense music and the exciting montage using great 50s style footage got me so hyped up that when the actual movie began it fell flat, it simply couldn't keep up that level.<br/><br/>I know everybody loves Bryan Cranston from his role in Breaking Bad (which admittedly I haven't seen) but I didn't find him particularly amazing as Joe Brody. What bothered me, and felt like a let down, was the introduction of his character, shot as a reveal with tension built up for no true purpose, building around a character that has virtually no screen time. Gareth Edwards repeats this mistake with the introduction of Admiral William Stenz (David Strathairn). All the reveal shots should've been left to our anti-hero Godzilla. The shots that introduce the monster are outstanding, it is in these moments that for once a blockbuster shows creativity in it's filmmaking and is not just a series of computer generated images that look like a video game. Just a side note, why is everything so centered in the middle of the frame nowadays, is it for a 3D purpose? It sacrifices a potentially really nice composition for an IMAX/3D effect that everybody won't get to see. But I'm just raging on 3D here, in the case of Godzilla it's really not that bad. The monster itself is a very nice design, close to the 1954 Godzilla monster (maybe his eyes bothered me a little, but hey I'm just being too picky now) however the MUTO cruelly lacked originality, they look like a mix between Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979), Transformers (Michael Bay) and Starship Troopers (1997). The designers could have done more research and asked themselves how their skin would be if they live so deep in the earth, how would the humidity effect them, etc.<br/><br/>The true disappointment in Godzilla though is the hour or so that we lose watching the incoherent US Army interaction that has been done a million times in this type of movie and is absolutely uninteresting, getting one to wonder if they care for the movie much at all. Instead the focus could have been on the main characters, developing their story, relationships and bonds so they could grow in depth before our eyes, the public would then care about their lives and not wonder if they care or not that they are once again watching the end of the world with the army failing to stop it.<br/><br/>This brings us to the tone of the movie: it never committed to the campy B-movie tone and charming cheesiness of its ancestor or to the intense but yet grotesque end of the world movie with it's ""Daddy, will you still be here tomorrow?"" tear jerker lines.<br/><br/>The last act is nonetheless enjoyable, it regains the audience interest and almost gets you to forget the hour of mediocrity you just watched. The filmmaking is imaginative, we are involved in the fate of the protagonists, the battle scenes are breath-taking and our long gone interest is piqued again but it's only to get us exited about Godzilla 2 (when I heard about the upcoming sequels I lost faith in humanity, yet again).<br/><br/>Godzilla wasn't all bad, but it had such a potential to be good that having it be mediocre is very disappointing.<br/><br/>Like my review?

","Godzilla(2014) Starring: Araon Taylor Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston,David Stratham,Ken Watanabe,Juliette Binoche,Richard T. Jones,Carson Bolde, and Sally Hawkins, Directed By:Gareth Edwards Review As a child I always wanted to see a Godzilla movie in theaters but unfortunately when there was one in America I was too young to see it and watched that crappy Zilla film from 1998 and my father said""Hey son it's Godzilla."" I responded ""It doesn't look like him daddy."" After waiting for twelve years I finally got to see a Godzilla film in theaters but does it live up to the predecessor from 1954? You might or might have not seen the original 1954 film,if you haven't I suggest you do it's amazing.But this reboot like all the other reboots and countless sequels to Godzilla it connects because it is his origin. In the opening sequence of the film is what in 1954 between America and Godzilla. Godzilla in this picture is not as silly as Americans have thought in the past. If you want a serious film go see this it will be very worth it. If you have followed my other reviews of Godzilla films you would note that not all of them had interesting characters, only three of them. But this finally has both interesting characters and emotional depth with some of them and this is a Godzilla film were you actually get to feel for Godzilla. Bryan Cranston plays a scientist who in 1999 saw his wife die at the nuclear plant where they work and believes that it's being covered up for a reason. His son on the other hand put it behind him, and he has a loving wife and a kid. But after joining his father to pick up some old discs to prove to him he's not crazy,they get arrested and find a giant ball that has electromagnetic radiated energy. A monster is unleashed from that ball and starts wrecking havoc. The rest is left to be seen. The movie is very dark like the original from 1954 and is very real with it's special effects by having a man in a suit of the new designed Godzilla and with some enhanced CGI is made to look like your actually looking at a monster, just like the Japanese films from the past. (if the new monsters were guys in suits or just CGI,I'm unaware.) It isn't as pix-elated as zilla from 1998,it's fooling into believing that your actually looking at a monster on screen. It will be the best CGI you will ever see in a film this year. A lot of the film centers on the human characters Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor Johnson), Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), Elle Brody(Elizabeth Olsen), Dr. Ishrio Seriwaza(Ken Watanabe) and Sandra Brody(Juliette Binoche). There might be some Godzilla fans who really don't care about that(I never really like those types of Godzilla fans and neither should you). The acting was the best thing about this movie. Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen give the best performances out of the movie. This Godzilla film is the best Godzilla film since the 2001 film(Godzilla,Mothra and King Ghidorah, Giant Monsters All Out Attack)this is a Godzilla film where you feel for the characters and the monster(Godzilla)it's purpose was to bring back the king of the monsters on film well mission accomplished director Gareth Edwards. Godzilla(2014) gets a 10 out of 10."

","From opening credits to last scene, Godzilla 2014 radiates! It's about intensive heat; either with the humans back story, how these creatures originated and survive and the films constant tension and action. Sneaky & unique opening credit sequence immediately has you intrigued. Not a wasted frame or moment with a fast moving storyline. So many of the negative reviews posted concern amounts of time given to characters and action. These people apparently share the same broken watch. The first hour build-up moved lightning quick with suspense turned up high. I was jolted out of my seat at last four times throughout the film and was always excited. Everything positive you've read in prior reviews is spot on. Honestly, I was enthralled with the non monster situations / action sequences as much as the battles and devastation scenarios. I'm back for another visit next week. Best film of 2014..... bar none!"
"meerkatchris","5","2","5","29 May 2014"," It was alright.
","I saw the movie last night with fair expectations and I have to admit that I was disappointed. I didn't dislike the movie, but I also didn't think it was a GOOD movie. It was alright. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The main issues I had with the film were similar to that discussed. I hated the fact that they killed off Bryan Cranston's character. He was the character that kept me fully involved throughout. I understood him and felt sorry for him. His son, however; not so much. Same goes with every single character, INCLUDING Godzilla himself. I noticed that unless you already KNEW that you were supposed to like and feel sympathy for Godzilla and not fear him, you would have no idea on what to think towards him.<br/><br/>I don't think the writing on this film was as good as it could have been to be honest. I do think that the film could have been significantly cut down. Again, going back to Bryan Cranston's character - after his death, it felt like we could have lost most of his running time in the first place since it didn't really seem to actually have much impact on the later film. They should have either kept his character throughout; cut his time down; OR at least make it feel as if his death actually meant something and something clever.<br/><br/>I also felt that there did need to be more fighting from the monsters. I didn't really feel there was much at all (especially not from what I expected). The end fight didn't really have much of a climax; it just kind of ended and then Godzilla swam back into the water. I felt there needed to be more focus on the fight and much more EMOTIONAL focus on Godzilla. <br/><br/>I did, however enjoy the movie. More-so the first half, but yeah. I did kind of like it and it had its moments (my favourite been the scene where the train automatically approaches the female MUTO with passengers on board. A perfect bit of tension.) but I felt there was too many issues to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>I'd give the film a 5/10."
"Thenotreturn","8","2","5","26 May 2014"," A work for the ages!!!
","This movie is spectacular, the graphics were undeniable, unbearable, and perhaps even breathtaking in many parts. I enjoyed the storyline of the movie the most although it may have not shown ""Godzilla"" as much as I'd liked to see him.(Only 20 minutes worth) I thought they played it off pretty well. I'll admit I was thinking Godzilla was not gonna be even worth my time but in the end it was well worth it. Well done to the director, graphics designer, and let's not forget about the actors. I agree Godzilla may not seem to inhibit most, especially the non ""SIFI"" viewers But if you'd give this movie a sure chance you may be embezzled by the effects. I think this movie mainly pertains to the younger audience such as ages 8-18 and to watch this masterpiece first hand on the big screen was a thing of beauty. Proud to have my vote 8-10"
"jokerswild1","7","2","5","26 May 2014"," A great return for the King of the Monsters
","As a huge fan of the Toho Godzilla films, I'm glad to say I really enjoyed this.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Godzilla himself is awesome. He's partially seen immediately after the opening credits, and a scene soon after takes place inside the skeleton of a member of his species. This builds up his first full appearance well, getting us excited to see him. It takes a while to happen, but his arrival is spectacular. The MUTOs are fairly well done, despite not being particularly original (most obvious is their hatching from a cocoon, a classic Mothra trait), but they do pose a threat to humanity effectively and make good enemies for Godzilla, and those are the most important things.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting is just OK, but it's made up for by giving his character a lot to do. For Elizabeth Olsen, it's the opposite, her character doesn't have much to do, but Olsen's acting is very good. Bryan Cranston gives the best performance in the film, the highlight of his acting being when his character shouts in demand to know what's really going on.<br/><br/>I was a little frustrated by the many cutaways just when some monster action was about to begin, but the epic final battle makes up for it. Now that I've seen this movie once and know my issues after being so excited to see it, I think this is the type of film that could very likely get even better with rewatches.<br/><br/>And how can you not love the way Godzilla kills the female MUTO?"

","As a 'monster movie buff' I enjoy all creature features, especially those that have a connection of beast to human emotions. I thought the movie is a bit long (running time 123 minutes), but I was so captivated and glued to my seat that I held off until the rolling credits for my rush to the men's room.<br/><br/>Be sure to go all out for the astonishing effects by viewing Godzilla in 3D on the XL screen at a Cinetopia (or comparable theater) as I did. Hopefully there is one in your area. Bryan Cranston's performance pulled a tear from my eye.<br/><br/>I call this one ""absolutely fabulous!"""
"videodrome1234","8","2","5","24 May 2014"," Godzilla rules
","Godzilla Godzilla was born in 54 in Japan and since then the island country has given the world 28 films. We found out important facts like Godzilla being a dinosaur, that mutated with and atomic explosion and he is a hero too in some of the films plus he's even surprisingly been a zombie too. There has been 9 different Godzilla designs in the films including the US versions too. The last film was directed by Kitamura and was named the Final War, it was nicely done and sent the old monster into retirement with respect. Then Toho announced that it will not be making any Godzilla films for 10 years. Of course the large monster inspired US film makers so Roland Emmerich directed the remake in 1998. I think the film was good in certain ways and in others not so much. In its time the visuals were good but they did some things in that film that I just don't know what to do with for instance Matthew Broderick as a hole and baby Godzillas In 2003 Tristar's license ran out even though they planed a trilogy (despite the fact that it was pretty successful they never made the sequels, most probably because of the criticisms, Final Wars and Toho) So we come now to a time that makes the rehabilitation of the monster possible with another studio. The new monsters parents are now Legendary Pictures and Warner, who not sparing money or talent tried to resurrect the king of monsters. First off they got the talented, young director Gareth Edwards to helm the project, who is not just a fan of the original series but who has already proved his worth with monsters and they left the story and the scrip up to talented people too. Plus mixing all this together was the 160 million dollar budget. And they brought to life the biggest Godzilla so far that still resembles the Japanese one. I for one liked Warner's monster movie so I was expecting a lot from Godzilla. So I'm not going to spoil anything, but I can say that if someone wants to see a Godzilla film they won't be disappointed. If you want more than just that, then you might be. The film isn't just for fans, but it definitely is for people who like huge visual productions. It's a visual orgy and Godzilla looks great too, you could only really criticize that the monster is maybe show a little less than in Pacific Rim. I think this film will be really judged by what expectations are. If you want to be entertained and can be by everything that a film entitled Godzilla can give you then yeah it'll be even better than you imagined. The director did a great job as fan. I could maybe only criticize him about two things the trailer was dark, depressing and the actual film was only that in a few scenes. Plus, he may not have been able to really do a good job with the characters. The actors are okay, they got noteworthy ones, Ken Watanabe of course is the best, maybe beside him Elizabeth Olsen stand out and that's when we get to the second negative criticism of the director. First off let me say the story is pretty set, you can't do much with it so I don't even want to knock that, but that said the script is pppfff rubbish. Almost like Pacific Rim, maybe with the only difference being that while there the story here was just plain insane and you knew it, here it becomes even more embarrassing plus the characters are all simple and one dimensional, they just didn't write it well enough. And the even bigger problem was that this wasn't the fault of the actors. It was really felt like it wasn't the actors who stunk up a few scenes, but the scrip and the director. Of course you can always ask yourself the question is any of this important at all? Its just a monster movie. But this stuff is the difference between an okay, a good film or one of the years best. I think the film was good, but it could have been one of the years best, and really if you don't see yourself enjoying a film about a 350 foot monster wrecking stuff you'll maybe only think the film is okay. I thought it was good, that to me translates to like 9 out of 10, but if I wasn't partial to monster movies maybe only a 6.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"

","Just watched the movie and no. 1 the trailer was very misleading 2nd all the big destruction recently got done in the Specific Rim. The scene will build up and then they will cut the action to the sub plot, which was good in the start but got very annoying towards the end. There were a lot of thing that lacked. Ken had his mouth opened as a sign of surprise in the whole movie. Bryan Cranston was good. There were some very good effects and 3D was even better. Once again the Hollywood style of showing the whole town being destroyed but the good guy has to reunite the missing kid to the family to be legend.

"samturnip1","7","2","5","23 May 2014"," GODZILLA: Is This The Film Everyone Is Making It Out To Be?
","For all the people who haven't seen this film I'll just put it simply for you, Godzilla is made up of 3 parts and 3 main characters, 2/3 of each were amazing, 1/3 of each let the film down massively, let me explain.<br/><br/>THE FIRST 1/3 of this film is set in Japan, it explains the origin of the first monster Godzilla must face, and is lead by the amazing Bryan Cranston, who's character in this film is Joe Brody. Both this 1/3rd of the film and Bryan Cranstons character are incredible, Cranston is a formidable actor whom I'm sure you've heard about in Breaking Bad, straight away you get a real feel for the character as he loses his wife and you he shows his acting talent. You really begin to feel for the character. 15 years pass and we find him in the scene where he is talking behind the glass, and again, his acting is incredible and really makes a movie theater go quiet, and right as he really starts to develop his character, what do they do? Kill him off :) this is where the movie starts to lose its credibility.<br/><br/>THE SECOND 1\3rd of this film is where all the bad reviews are being generated from and also where it honestly became the biggest yawn-fest in cinema history, the director of this movie thought it appropriate to let Aaron Taylor-Johnson then lead the rest of this film, this ""kick-ass"" dead eyed bland actor along with the writer are what made this film bad. Taylor-Johnson's character through a series of very unlikely coincidences just happens to follow each prominent event in the Godzilla time-line. As soon as he becomes the central character in this film, you just lose interest, he simply cannot act. Taylor-Johnson's character's dad dies in front of his eyes, he is lead to believe he has lost his child and wife, he see's these huge monsters up close and is deployed out of a plane right into the middle of a huge monster fight and he does not shed a tear or ever look more than slightly surprised once. So we follow this character through this awful side-line plot filled with random events like a brief relationship with some Asian boy on a train and some army buddy he meets, all so he can get home to his wife and kid, and the director thought that this was way more interesting than the main event, which is the monsters fighting. Every time it looks like something interesting is about to happen the director then cuts back to this stupid actor with his half-assed sideline plot, seriously? come on.<br/><br/>The Final 1/3rd of this film, however, is lead by our main man, GODZILLA! and it is simply awesome! after the director stops teasing us we finally get to see the final battle (which I went to see in imax) and oh my god, it's amazing! a lot of people complain that it's not the same as Pacific Rim but I think that's a good thing, it's a Godzilla movie, and that final battle was way more entertaining than any of the battles in pacific rim (although I love that movie). Apart from the stupid bit where Godzilla gets knocked over from a building, despite tearing through every other building he comes in contact with, it really makes you go silent in the theater and think ""holy Sh*t"".<br/><br/>Now really this film had the potential to be outstanding, but unfortunately it won't get remembered as a great because of the main portion of this film being so boring, there are several things they should have changed. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston could and Should have lead this film, killing him off was a dumb idea. Even dumber was casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the lead, they should have casted Aaron Paul (Jesse from Breaking Bad) as the lead! hey it'd of been tacky but a damn sight better than the current lead. <br/><br/>They also should have included more monsters and more battles like pacific rim, they had several fights that lead to a huge one at the end, this would have been a better idea, fighting a few smaller monsters then leading up to a huge climax battle at the end, also I didn't really like the look of the other two monsters in the film personally, I think they should have chose different monsters from the old Godzilla movies but hey, that's just my opinion. <br/><br/>Now, I get that the director was trying to make this film similar to Jaws or Alien in that you don't see the beast properly until the end, but the reason of that in those films were because of the limited practical effects and it was compensated by flawless acting and an unbeatable storyline, this film however had neither in the middle portion of the film which is where the director has made his mistake. Pacific Rim shows us that the technology to make these huge scale realistic CGI fights exists and so the makers of this film should have damn-well used it more often! <br/><br/>Overall though, this film was entertaining and I did like it, it's just frustrating because it could have been so much better than what it is, this is just my opinion however and I'm sure some of you who are die-hard fans of the old Godzilla films adored this film because it references the original and is more true to the original films unlike the awful 1998 Godzilla.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend going to see this movie though and I am very much looking forward to the sequel!"
"amesmonde","Null","2","5","22 May 2014"," Apt Godzilla for serious fans
","Godzilla comes out of monster retirement to dispose of some unearthed nasty MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms), and an officer in the United States Navy must get to his family after aiding his work obsessed father.<br/><br/>There are no one liners and gags, this appears to have been made for Godzilla fans and fans of film as the tone isn't that of the usual mainstream popcorn flick, with this take on Godzilla being reminiscent of the original films. There are some fantastic visuals on show,the special effects are exceptional and the music and sound design are excellent. Director Gareth Edwards creates some tension and atmosphere and successfully gives the much needed scope and scale to battle scared Godzilla when he is finally revealed midway through.<br/><br/>The MUTO designs appear to unavoidably borrow elements from Starship Troopers; Star Wars Episode 2; Pacific Rim to name a few and the influx of creature films over the years slightly takes the edge off the spectacle. In addition, Godzilla's emotional functional storyline borrows a pivotal plot point from Gareth Edwards' own film Monsters (2010), which is odd considering Dave Callaham wrote this offering.<br/><br/>All the actors are on fine form, Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston are notable. Effects aside the everyday detail is unprecedented, the Las Vegas, tsunami and battleship helm segments to name a few are meticulously created, the film feels very real at times in terms of look and background activity aided by the excellent sets and locations. The designed sequences of movements between the MUTOs and Godzilla in the showdown fights are choreographed and executed finely giving mass and character to the unidentified terrestrial organisms.<br/><br/>Overall, a visual treat and apt Godzilla entertainment."

","(Sorry for my bad English) Wow, finally a new film on Godzilla!! How a film on Godzilla could be a bad film? I don't know. I liked it, but in my personal and modest opinion the film had to be more catastrophic. It's a film on a giant f*****g mysterious monster who shoot his atomic breath down the throat of other monsters. I think that the first part of the film is bad managed, the story is started in a way but with the death of Joe this way changes and in a sentimental and patriotic way that i had not appreciated so much. The protagonist had to be Godzilla, not Ford. Com'on!! A 123 minutes film of a giant lizard razing buildings and shooting atomic breaths everywhere would be more appreciated, to be a film on Godzilla obviously. Check this film out and have fun. To be seen!!"
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","5","19 May 2014"," Highly Entertaining Summer Flick
","This was my first time seeing a Godzilla movie, and I'm glad it was because of how great the special effects are. At this point there's really no need to go back and watch the old movies. This one is good but not great. The scenes with Godzilla are easily the most thrilling scenes all year. I saw it in 3D ETX and when Godzilla roars you can feel it throughout the whole movie theater. But the film suffers at times from focusing too much on other monsters. I think I can say that the two other creatures had more screen time than Godzilla himself.<br/><br/>The human characters are fine but lets face it, weren't we all disappointed when they killed off Bryan Cranston in the first 15 minutes. I was thinking this would be the role after Breaking Bad that would put him with the Gary Oldmans of the world. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is good and I can see some future star power in him and Elizabeth Olsen in the forthcoming Avengers movies and inevitable spin-offs. I liked their chemistry but none of the dialogue got my emotionally moved the way I had hoped. Even though the last 15 minutes are incredibly intense, where was that the rest of the movie. There's just too much time spent on the human characters rather than Godzilla.<br/><br/>I really have no idea what the main storyline of the inevitable sequel will be. I mean I feel like these movies are better off being standalone movies instead of franchises. The sequel could surprise me but there's something to be said about the shock that people have when they first see Godzilla. Im assuming there will be some sort of human character who wants to create huge robots or other monsters much like Transformers 3.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and if your going to see it, see it in theaters. The 3D is useless and you really don't even notice it. This movie is meant to be seen with an audience on a huge screen. A few problems here and there don't diminish the thrill you get while seeing this.<br/><br/>+truly thrilling experience<br/><br/>+Godzilla anti hero?<br/><br/>-not enough Godzilla!<br/><br/>8.0/10"

","**Minor Godzilla Spoilers (Not much to spoil)**<br/><br/>So just walked out of ""Godzilla"". Should have been called ""SOLDIERS, THEIR FAMILY...oh, and godzilla"". I guess they were trying to make it more about humans (or military life). But I paid to watch Godzilla tear stuff up. They literally avoided showing the monster fights; monsters face off, run towards each other and then cut to humans in peril. The movie was mostly giant monsters walking and everyone trying not to get smushed under their big feet (mean girls reference). Altogether there is about 3/4 of a monster fight scene. The movie also started off going in one direction then abruptly and awkwardly switches gears and changes focus. Pretty boring, but maybe Pacific Rim just set the bar higher."

","Do you like character driven old school giant monster movies? A combining the scope of lets say ""World War Z' with correct use of CGI to tell the story of the ""Pacific Rim"". In many ways this version of ""Godzilla"", an old Japanese cult character, story wise is very close to the original Japanese movies from 50's - 70's, Godzilla contra what ever monstrosity writers would come up with. Considering the quality of the movie I was surprised to attend a screening with cinema being half full. Is it because this movie lacks a big name Hollywood star that would be able to hold the pressure of the movie on his popularity. Some might say that Bryan Cranston work is enough, but I beg to differ. Based on the fact that we don't see him enough in the plot, which in itself is the narrative point of the story, the rest of the cast is solid, but without someone truly standing out. Here director Gareth Edwards succeeds in creating a film that even though full of potential references to it's predecessors creates something, maybe less original, but superbly well executed. In moments there are Hitchcock like original story points (without giving to much away, we generally do not expect to get our protagonist killed off in the first act of the movie) at other the main characters and story off the plot seems not well motivated enough to be believable. At first the mission is to send the analog nuclear bomb to destroy the creatures, eventually becoming the danger to the town, so needed to be evacuated on to the sea and detonated there. The good thing about this film is the character driven part of a plot focusing on the characters and their individual stories. The original idea that Godzilla is in fact a ""good"" character protecting us from another creatures which due to the radioactivity gained gigantic size called MUTO. Their confrontation in San Francisco is the culmination point of the movie. Of course there are some episodic narrative personal stories that ad to the drama of overall visual extravaganza. ""Godzilla"" in fact often leaves a lot to our imagination not showing to much, but when you are able to see something it is truly work of CGI excellence. One of the best use of CGI in combination with great sound design. The music is well contracted specially great musical moment when marines are jumping on to a fog, the composer used the same musical shouts like in Stanley Kubbrick's dark sound for the alien monument on the moon in 2001: A Space Odyssey. For some reason this film style wise and in terms of dramatic choices for gathering tension remind me old movies of Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock and J.J Abrams which is not a bad place for a director Gareth Edwards to be artistically associated with. One of the better movies of it's kind in western tradition of the Monster vs. Monster blockbusters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

","I'm going to start off by saying, don't expect to see much of Bryan Cranston (Walter White from breaking bad). He is WAY over advertised in the previews. Now with that being said I'll finish up my review. <br/><br/>To be honest when it started out I was on the edge of my seat begging for more. As it progressed it only got better and more interesting until around 1/3 of the way through the film. After that 1/3 of the way through it becomes painfully apparent that this movie really isn't going to bring much to the table other than snappy visual effects and scary music. With such good storytelling in the beginning and such great acting and action sequences, I was pleasantly surprised only to be let down by the thinning of the plot, the pointlessness of the human actions and the overall focus on the ""all American soldier"" got old pretty fast. The irony is that if the beginning hadn't been so good, the ending wouldn't have seemed so bad. <br/><br/>Conclusion: The action sequences really suck you in, the pure scale of the movie is incredible and the monsters look amazing, but the plot gets worse as time goes on and the American soldier focus gets old REALLY quick. I'm glad I saw it in theatres for the experience, but I'm not sure I'll be suggesting it to anyone, and I certainly won't be buying it."
"MasterOfTheMovieverse","5","2","5","18 May 2014"," FRUSTRATING TO WATCH!!! Godzilla Is All Roar But No Bite!
","This is my first review for IMDb and I feel inclined to write this because this was one of the most frustrating movies I've ever watched!<br/><br/>I didn't mind the pace or the story (you don't go to see a Godzilla film for the story), the first hour was great and the build up to the King of Monsters is spot on. His entrance into the film is grand and spectacular. You see his foot crash down, the camera pans up revealing his body and zones in on his face... Cue the infamous Godzilla Roar (which shook my cinema), it's epic stuff but don't expect anything more than that. Just when you think there's going to be a monstrous throw down the camera cuts away and instead we're forced to watch the fight unfold through a TV broadcast.<br/><br/>WHAT ON EARTH WAS GARETH EDWARDS THINKING??!!!! <br/><br/>This is not what you call ""teasing"" the monster, this is called being a D**K! Especially since you've already waited an hour for his arrival. However he doesn't do this once or twice but three times! Just when you think things are going to get ugly, whether it's with Godzilla vs. the MUTOs or the MUTOs vs. the army we're forced to watch the events through a TV station again and again and again! Why on earth would you do this to a film with $160 million budget? It worked for Monsters because it was a low budget feature, but to do this to a summer blockbuster is idiotic.<br/><br/>The final throw down is not much better either. Yes, we're finally given the fight we've been all been waiting for but you're so angered by the previous events you just don't care anymore. What is even more infuriating is that the final brawl is ruined because we're not given full flowing shots of the devastation. It continuously cuts away to something else, whether it's Aaron Johnson saving the day or some random bystander. Who made these decisions? Was it Max Borenstein (the script writer) or Gareth Edwards? Whoever it was needs a huge smack in the face! <br/><br/>For everything Godzilla gets right it gets two things wrong. I loved the tone, the atmosphere, the MUTOs, Godzilla is perfect and my god his Atomic breath is awesome! The story is fine too. IF they do a sequel please get rid of Edwards and give this to someone who won't shy away from the monster showdowns! <br/><br/>I'm giving this a 6.5 out of 10. This film could have been epic, but instead it's a missed opportunity (especially when they had Bryan Cranston on board). It had all the right ingredients to be the king of monster movies, but that slipped as soon as Edwards started playing games with his ""teasing"" B.S. If you want to watch a great Monster Movie look no further than the classic Jurassic Park at least Spielberg doesn't shy away from his creations."
"TheSeaLion","8","2","5","18 May 2014"," A fun summer blockbuster
","When I was younger, I was a big fan of Godzilla. I watched a lot of the older movies and the Roland Emmerich ""Godzilla"" from 1998. Despite the love I had for these movies when I was younger, I had since lost interest in the films and did not think much about them. When I heard about this movie being released, I was interested in seeing it, but I had some fears that it would be an overblown, dumb monster vs. monster action movie with no time or thought put into it. Thankfully, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Opening up in the Philippines in 1999, the skeletal remains of a large creature are discovered after a mining accident. Inside the skeleton, there are two pods, one closed and one opened. A trail of destruction leads from the opened pod to the ocean. Meanwhile, in Japan, seismic activities start to occur at a power plant. The activity around the power plant costs the lives of many people, including the main character, Ford's (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) mother (Juliette Binoche). The event causes Ford's father (Bryan Cranston) to spend the next fifteen years looking for answers.<br/><br/>Ford is called to Japan fifteen years later when his father is arrested for entering a quarantine zone. Ford decides to help his father reenter the quarantine zone, but they are captured and brought to the old power plant. At the plant, there is more seismic activity and a creature awakens, which ends up mortally wounding Ford's father and escaping out to the ocean. Ford attempts to go home, finding himself in the midst of destruction caused by the creature, and decides to help the military kill it so he can return to his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and his son (Carson Bolde).<br/><br/>What took me by surprise is how the story was told. Godzilla and the other creatures do fight in the movie, but there is barely any of the fight shown. It mostly focuses on Ford and whoever he's with trying to get a mission underway that they believe will kill the creatures. I think many people would probably be underwhelmed with the movie for this fact, but I liked it because barely showing the fights and showing what the characters are doing during the fights is something not a lot of monster movies do.<br/><br/>The characters of the movie are pretty bland and forgettable. Ford is your typical main character who is a husband and father trying to do what's best for his family. His family is just his family, though they did not bother me like a lot of families in movies do. Ford's dad, played by the brilliant Bryan Cranston, is misused as a character who mostly spouts exposition and then dies. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa is just a scientist. There isn't anything interesting about the characters, but that is made up for by the scale of the movie and the amazing effects.<br/><br/>The path of destruction ranges from Japan, to Hawaii, to Las Vegas, to San Francisco, and there is a lot of diversity to the destruction. Sometimes we just see the creature march through the area, we see Godzilla cause a tsunami when he first arrives in Hawaii, and we see naval ships being tossed from the water. With the little bit of monster vs. monster we see in the movie, it is exciting and a blast to watch. My only complaint is that I would have liked to see one of the monsters go through a smaller town, just to see what the destruction would be like in a place that wasn't a big city.<br/><br/>Godzilla has never looked better on the big screen. The towering creature looks like he is actually there, and his laser breath blast looks real. The effects of the film are also really good. The weather effects used during the battle between Godzilla and the other creatures in San Francisco set a very eerie mood and tone.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" is in no way a brilliant movie, but when it comes to summer blockbusters, it is a lot of fun. It does have pretty boring characters like a lot of summer action movies do, but the story is thought out and well paced, you can tell what is happening amid the destruction, and the monsters look amazing."

","I loved this film. If you are looking for a monster movie with Godzilla in it every ten seconds then this movie is not for you. I think they portrayed the main characters very well. I could relate to most of them. I think this movie had a good story, decent acting, decent music but man the CGI is amazing. So if you are looking for the same old Godzilla from the old days then this will not make you happy. If you want something new and exciting then give this a shot. The fact that they have a story and it involves him fighting other monsters is pretty awesome. The only glitch or flaw that I didn't care for was when the male creature delivered the radiation to the female he literally served no purpose. He didn't have to fertilize the eggs and the female could have easily gotten her own radiation to raise her brew. So I'm not sure what that was all about. Even with that irritating me I still loved the movie and the action scenes."

All I could tell you back then, is that it was a new Godzilla movie which might include several other monsters in it. So I didn't really know what I was in for. This film focus a little bit more on human beings and character's back stories, It's not all about monsters and a lot more about humans. Godzilla is in it obviously, but it's not all about him. It's about humans who have to deal with the fact that there are big walking monsters in the world. The point is that we have to feel that those monsters exist and that they are a real threat for humanity. That's why this film is working so well. However I wished they show a little bit more of Godzilla fighting scenes, not those special report news telling us that the monsters are devastating cities etc. Since it's mostly about the characters, they are pretty good. Bryan Cranston for instance is awesome in the movie. He has a couple of really emotional scenes but he's not out there that much though, which is a little bit disappointing as well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is in the movie and he's good enough. Kind of statues as a military force, he just wants to get the job done which make sense in a way. ""Let's get it done!"" I can't help myself but to compare this Godzilla film with Pacific Rim which annoys me as Godzilla is so much more realistic - not that cooler though, but good nonetheless. It's directed extremely well and gives a kind of humans perspective regards to these creatures, it sold them. They're not monsters. Those creatures are animals who are trying to survive on this planet. Finally, the score by Alexandre Desplat is fantastic, I loved how it sounds.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was epic and looked epic. But don't expect Pacific Rim because you will be disappointed. This film is smarter displaying a mankind view of nature."
"Jakestro","7","2","5","18 May 2014"," Mess With Nature And Nature Will Always Mess Back
","Back in 1954, the original Godzilla taught us many things.<br/><br/>Mess with nature and nature will always mess back. Give a monster a motive and the audience is yours. Get the atmosphere right and no one will notice the cracks in your budget. Or at least care.<br/><br/>Created as a vehicle to sustain director Roland Emmerich's blockbusting momentum after Independence Day, the last Hollywood version of Godzilla taught us something else entirely: Special effects can't single-handedly carry a giant monster film and it can't simply rely on big named actors either. Which is why nobody's seen Mr. Emmerich since 1998.<br/><br/>As the creator of 2010's acclaimed sci-fi-on-a-shoestring ""'Monsters""' and now the director of this hopeful franchise-reboot, Gareth Edwards has clearly learned from these lessons – for the most part.<br/><br/>But while the blood of ""Monsters"" runs through it, it's pretty obvious where – or rather who – this 2014 Godzilla's greatest inspiration comes from.<br/><br/>From the ""War of the Worlds"" plotting and inevitable nods to ""Jurassic Park"" to sundry small but ""Close Encounters"" (note the shape of those sonographs), it's got Spielberg's baseball cap all over it. The 2014 reboot of Godzilla is a hugely serious business starting in 1999 with a genuinely wrenching tragedy at a Japanese nuclear facility that leaves scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) torn from his wife (Juliette Binoche) and son Ford.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, army lieutenant Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is on leave with his own son and wife (Elizabeth Olsen) when he is summoned back to Japan to get his now-paranoid dad out of jail.<br/><br/>Convinced that the events of 1999 were part of a massive cover-up, Joe has made a nuisance of himself ever since. But with the truth almost in his grasp, Joe drags Ford back to the abandoned city they once lived to retrieve the last pieces of the puzzle.<br/><br/>They find all the evidence they need. Much more. As do the researchers at the heart of the conspiracy (Ken Watanabe and the spare part-like Sally Hawkins).<br/><br/>And as if one hundred-story, radiation-absorbing, evolution-defying menace wasn't enough for the world to deal with, there are more.<br/><br/>On top of that, like every other recent global threat film that doesn't take place in New York, they're all heading for San Francisco. Where Ford's family happens to live.<br/><br/>Yes, Edwards even throws in the old 'packed schoolbus on a bridge' routine as everything between Hawaii and Vegas is caught in a devastating pincer movement that renders the US Armed Forces as impotent as a basket of neutered puppies.<br/><br/>Like previously mentioned, a blockbuster shouldn't live and die by it's special effects, but in many ways that's often as much as Godzilla has going for it, alongside a number of exquisitely composed and atmospheric shots.<br/><br/>The visuals are astonishing, whether it's the creatures tearing down entire cities or a tsunami devastating Honolulu.<br/><br/>The first big sighting is just about worth the wait and the one thing Edwards certainly manages to get right are the reveals. As Godzilla or the M.U.T.O.'s appear from out of smoke or out of the sky to maul each other or a skyscraper, he's able to deliver a handful of truly jaw- dropping sequences. Godzilla is huge and really quite unsettling as a presence, and in one or two moments the film touches on being a proper intense film, posing genuine danger from these massive beasts.<br/><br/>And how they love it, supplementing their smash-and-trash campaign with bursts of electromagnetic mayhem that leaves cities powerless and – in one eerily impactful scene – causes planes to drop out of the sky.<br/><br/>And yet it's often to be found skimping on the action, cutting out early from the scraps and only showing us the aftermath rather than the main event. As a result the first two-thirds consist of an awful lot of teasing, which, in less capable hands, could have been a blockbusting mistake. <br/><br/>Although it could be argued that an all-out assault would be exhausting in a Transformers or Pacific Rim sort of way.<br/><br/>A little lightness of touch might have worked wonders too. It's an entirely humorless affair, which makes you question the point of having something as silly as two hours of monsters hitting each other when it doesn't try to make you smile once. Enjoy the thrill of the few times when Godzilla lets rip with all his might, but mayhem isn't really enough if you're not having fun with it.<br/><br/>Godzilla, after all, is the reason you're here. But like most bill- topping acts, and with millions of years of pent-up, FX-fuelled frustration to release, he's worth the wait.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review, please don't hesitate to check out my other ones at www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!"

","It has everything you'd expect from a Toho movie, but made by Legendary; Indestructible Nuclear Breathing Godzilla, monster fights, epic roar etc. Aka, way better than the horrible 1998 Zilla.<br/><br/>My only complaints are Ford's (the main character) father's plot line. Felt it was kinda unessecary imo. Felt that the movie wouldn't be much different without it imho. <br/><br/>Props to Legendary for making this movie, hopefully it's successful enough to make sequels, would be a delight for Godzilla and monster fans out there. Godzilla sequels are kinda easy to make with so many monsters available from the Toho movies <br/><br/>All in all, a must watch for Godzilla fans."
"qwasta","7","2","5","18 May 2014"," The trailers and teasers made me think of a different, much darker plot. like the original
","(Not a good review, its just me ranting about how I wished the plot went with a few spoilers so don't take it too seriously; my first time registering and reviewing a movie on IMDb so ignore this in favor of far better reviewers)<br/><br/>After seeing it, I kind of liked it, I must say it was a cool monster movie, but it was just an OK GODZILLA movie. I personally think not for everyone...so if you're a true Godzilla lover of the FIRST movie of its franchise beware. I don't mind the plot and characters too much, but I still wished it was scripted different and how it was executed.<br/><br/>To be honest, when it mentioned that this Godzilla film will returns to ""gritty roots of the original film"" I was hoping it would be much much darker, tragic, somber or foreboding like the original Godzilla film.<br/><br/>The trailers and teasers were what sucked me in, Before watching the movie, they made me think and want for the plot be Godzilla itself/himself as the main problem for humanity by eventually surfacing and destroying cities, cause tsunamis and other destructive things. The government/military seemed to know about since 1954 and prepared MUTO monsters as experiments to fight Godzilla but eventually just got out of control and became cannon fodder Godzilla's wrath along the way. So I expected myself watching a Godzilla film similar to the 1954 original Godzilla movie about humanity's intense emotional, physical and futile struggle trying to kill something GODLIKE like Godzilla off for their survival and safety and while Godzilla keeps bringing grief and terror to humanity in ""a force of nature"" sort of way<br/><br/>And than the meaning ""the arrogance of man thinking nature is in their control...and not the other way around"" would come to fruit when the ending would involve the government/military/people's plan to wait for either Godzilla or Muto to win (Godzilla obviously) then they nuke him. But he survives and would punish and destroy the city out of rage, like nature is punishing them for challenging it and then ends with Godzilla swimming back to the ocean while the camera focuses on the destruction and ruins.<br/><br/>I wanted to see sad scenes of people recovering from Godzilla like a natural disaster kinda like the first Godzilla movie. Scenes like silently pacing around in despair, going to churches and temples to crying, mourning and praying to religion for some kind of miracle/salvation from Godzilla and even the Mutos running around also causing problems instead of just reacting in awe to the monsters presence and destruction. I even wanted to feel sorry for the main character/protagonist (Ford Brody) by having him to losing everything including like his family, friends and his very life during the movie. Halfway through the movie I was really hoping it won't be a nice ""hey, main character/protagonist and wife/son ALL happily united and survived all this disaster while people survivors would broadcast Godzilla as some kind of a hero for killing Muto and uh...something about restoring balance to nature while watching him swim back to the sea!"" ending kind of way. <br/><br/>I glad they represented Godzilla and how he made me,a human, feel small and insignificant compare to him and that he is an animal, (a destructive animal that became nearly godlike from nuclear radiation but an animal nonetheless.)and not exactly portrayed as to be a hero or a savior but also not in a completely senseless evil way as well; just a beast like and primal being of potential destruction, death and mayhem to all and every living thing around it, whether this creature does it on purpose or not like the original film because Godzilla is a force of nature, and just like nature, IT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LITTLE ANTS LIKE YOU, ME OR THE REST OF HUMANITY<br/><br/>Call me ungrateful because I am, For many of you guys will love this movie or not, for me, i didn't want a happy ending, I just wanted a sad, tragic story + ending for the 2014 Godzilla film that'll make me go home thinking about anti nuclear wars, weapons and how small we can be in the face of nature. (although the movie did made me feel that a bit) <br/><br/>I liked it, and I will buy it on Blueray, but what i am saying is that the movie was just not how I hoped it would be because of how the trailers and teasers hyped it to be."
"irrelevantlife","8","2","5","17 May 2014"," A very thorough and modern take on GODZILLA
","Godzilla (2014) is a very competent monster movie, with easy to follow plot and likable characters, containing some of the best CGI ever done in a movie.<br/><br/>The monster action is very well made, and many scenes are foreboding, dark and atmospheric. It does take a while for Godzilla to show up, but the antagonist monster(s) are interesting creatures of their own, and help the movie not to drag.<br/><br/>The best human character is undoubtedly the one played by Bryan Cranston. He shows true depth, conviction and makes us care. It is then a big shame when he leaves the movie, early on. <br/><br/>The other characters, one of them played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson come off very wooden, and lack the display of human emotions in the light of such incredible and dangerous circumstances the movie presents.<br/><br/>Don't walk into this movie expecting action on the level of last year's Man of Steel or Pacific Rim, as much of the action is saved for last.<br/><br/>For monster movie fans, and Godzilla fans this is a must see. They left the ending open for a potential sequel, let's hope we see more of Godzilla on the big screen."
"Incendid","7","2","5","16 May 2014"," A much needed revival.
","Ciaran: I went to my local cinema who had just received 3D and i watched what i though was going to be one of the better movies of the year. I don't know why i got myself hyped up so much because i just fell even further, so here is my review of Godzilla. Let's start with the acting with Johnson as our lead he really doesn't say much..at all, and when he does speak it is literally five words- now this didn't bother me too much just it did get annoying. Wantanabe provided a decent performance and he didn't say much either, heck pretty much nobody said much in this film, i think the only person who said anything more than five words was Cranston who was axed before the 30 minute mark. Now we move onto the CGI, and boy it was impressive, no flaws and actually quite convincing, except for maybe the flood scene, even so i am glad to see that the money went to the department that is needed the most in a film like this. Now onto the writing, what can you expect from a monster film, poor writing and not the greatest explanation for a story, the film itself was so predictable and so stereotypical it wasn't even funny, i just feel the movie could have been better if the writers (who also wrote Doom and The Expendables) could have put some more effort into their work. Now i come to the final and most important component, the action and it really did work, it was perfect, Godzilla's reveal- perfect, the fight scene in Hawaii- awesome and final battle in San Fransisco, well it was a little bit overdone but still i can bypass that and say with confidence that this remake was better than the 1998 version. I highly recommend you watch Godzilla as it is awesome, just not a great film therefore it receives a 6/10.<br/><br/>Jacob's Review: I thoroughly enjoyed Godzilla. I was not expecting anything brilliant but I did want to be thrilled, scared and pumped and it delivered in those areas with only a few areas to improve on for me to call it a great monster movie. The acting was great, especially Bryan Cranston but the human characters could have been developed slightly more. The lead was was not too generic but did not offer much. I thought Cranston was the lead but it turns out that he was a secondary character. The film is ludicrous but not in a Pacific Rim way where everything is childishly stupid but there are some reality bending moments that I was willing to forgive such as people surviving great falls. I feel that if the movie focused more on panic from the human characters (which we spend most of the movie with) then the fear could have been more effective. People panic for sure but in some situations people are doing business as usual. And yes, there are monsters in this movie. A big surprise was two giant rhino beetles and a fat man in a lizard costume. I was surprised at how little of the title character was in this movie, however his reveal, design, roar and monstrous presence make it worthwhile. These creatures are portrayed more as animals and give a few explanations for how they operate. The flying Clover-field monsters feed on radioactive material and just radiation. They even eat radioactive waste from unused nuclear bombs. This movie has an enormous scope and goes as far as making Godzilla an anti-hero which is cheesy and confusing since he kills millions with just one step. A great, fun, modern action monster movie 8/10."
"sonic_guardian","8","2","5","16 May 2014"," Some weird editing decisions, but overall really good!
","I felt quite confused while i was watching this, not because of the plot but because of some of the decisions that was made into the movie, but i can definitively say that when the credits started rolling, i had the biggest smile on my face.<br/><br/>As expected the movie focuses a lot on the humans and military, but instead of focusing on overdone simplistic character driven stories like most disaster movies out there, this one actually focuses on the events of the plot per se, the movie teases that the main character may be characterized by his father issues, but this quickly becomes a device to set him on the plot's course. This has the downside of the characters not being exactly the most interesting people out there and having almost no development, but honestly, when you go to see a movie called Godzilla you don't sign for human drama, but for the monster and the events surrounding him.<br/><br/>With that being said though, the movie does take a little of it's sweet time to get things moving, the first part focuses on the fact that the real cause of a certain disaster was not natural, but because of something that the government is hiding, while it's a huge thing for the characters it feels more like padding for the viewers, since it's obvious to us that the source of the problems is a monster. It's not that bad of a start though, at the very least it's not painful like Peter Jackson's King Kong that definitively could use some cuts here and there, Godzilla may actually take just as long as Kong to appear, but you had stuff with the story going on before, so the wait is not only less painful, it's also more rewarding.<br/><br/>Without giving much away, for most of the movie we are watching the military tracking two giant monsters that are wracking havoc, and Godzilla appears to put an end to this, 'cause that's pretty much his job, but the way the movie handles this is a little... Funny. Every time a monster appear there's this sense of scale and dread, but it focus a lot on revealing the monster and the civilian/military reactions, not much on their doings, most times you won't get to see the destruction of the city and is only shown devastated as a aftermath, and it even goes out of it's way to tease a huge fight about to happen, only to cut it almost entirely, twice, including the first appearance of the titular monster.<br/><br/>I do understand why they decided to cut though, there's just so much you can do with distinct monsters fighting: Bitting and throwing each other, if they did show the first two fights it would become repetitive and would remove a lot from the excitement of the final showdown which was definitively the highlight of the movie, it feels pretty much like the Avengers where the movie throws everything it's got on the last act, we don't get as much military interference and we finally have clear shots of the monsters giving all they got. The amazing CGi, combined with the great sound effects and amazing musical score really sets the mood and we find ourselves really rooting for Godzilla, which is extremely sympathetic and definitively a true hero. The movie would benefit from having less interference though.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Godzilla is a interesting movie that kind of loses itself at some points, but has one of the most blood pumping final act you could ask for in any kind of action, monster or super hero movie. The last act alone would get a 10 out of 10 from me, but overall a 8 out of 10 does it justice, can't wait for the blu-ray release."
"thesar-2","7","2","5","16 May 2014"," NowThey'll Need a Bigger Box
","Shame on anyone who even comes close to comparing this 2014 updated Godzilla movie to the horrid 1998 Matthew Broderick version. It would be like putting Batman & Robin in the same league as The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>So, in other words, forget that tragedy of a mistake 16 years ago. But, do remember Godzilla from the better part of the last century.<br/><br/>This is a movie to absorb and recount your feelings following. Definitely followingbecause all the way through it was I disappointed in this or that and that was probably because this was my movie event of 2014 and one I was looking forward to the second that 1998 movie ended. I wanted them to make a serious Godzilla movie. I knew they had the technology (Jurassic Park was half a decade before the 1998 flop) so I wanted to see a real, honest, big-ass Godzilla flick.<br/><br/>Once this movie was over, I did realize that they actually did immortalize the series and original from sixty years ago. They captured every element (aside from one) and give Japan a very well-made, apology/make-up from the 1998 movie.<br/><br/>What disappointed me during the screening was the lack of SHOW DON'T TELL – the technique I learned as a journalist in school. Consistently, we got the ""Look at what the monster did!"" destruction scene, but we hardly got to see it happening. Or, if we did, we saw it on a sad little TV screen. Um, I paid to see this on the BIG IMAX (Liemax, whatever) screen. This reminded me a bunch of the other huge green monster on screen: Ang Lee's Hulk when a ton of the action I wanted to see big was in tiny little boxes. How cuteNOT.<br/><br/>Yes, I get this is from the director of Monsters, a movie I really liked. But, there, where he showed his giant creatures rarely, as well, I figured it was because they had no budget. Here, he proved it was for some TELL DON'T SHOW opposite effect.<br/><br/>I don't care for this style of filmmaking. I understand there are a bunch of people out there that like their monsters in the shadows, or worse, off-screen, but I do want to see them. Almost always on screen. I could go home to a dark house and pretend there are monsters around every corner and have the same impact. Hell, I'd even save money and time doing so.<br/><br/>So, unfortunately, most of the movie is putting together what everyone in the movie is seeing but we'll never. Mercifully, the end climatic battle – no spoiler there, you knew that was coming and expected, made up for 90% of the vacancies in the movie. <br/><br/>Backtracking here a bit. Godzilla starts with multiple stories in the past which lead up to our cast of a few humans tracking the events in the story and why we would have a giant beast named Godzilla in the first place. It does twist the original story a bit, but for the most part stays faithful to the core of the legend.<br/><br/>Present day arrives and government cover-ups from years/decades past unravel and the situation cannot be contained. Godzilla is on the loose and the world will see his wrath.<br/><br/>Absolutely will I provide no spoilers here in regards to the plot, motivations and surprises. But, suffice to say, when all is said and done, i.e. you get to the climactic battle, it IS ALL WORTH IT. Especially, if you've grown up on the Godzilla lore, like I did.<br/><br/>Actually, I am a HUGE Godzilla fan while growing up. Saturday morning's ""From Beyond"" segment followed the normal cartoon lineups. Heck, even the opening credits to that two-hour TV block was the water waves produced by Godzilla emerging from the depths of the ocean for the very first time.<br/><br/>For the structure (and special effects, score and cinematography) they satisfied my need to get the Godzilla film series back on track in America. Unfortunately, there was one bad side-effect on them trying to be as faithful as possible to the source material: a poor line up of humans. <br/><br/>The actors, God love them, especially Bryan Cranston, his on-screen hunk of a son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the obvious Asian voice of anti-human/pro-nature: Ken Watanabe. They all did what they needed to do on screen. Nothing more. Nothing that made me truly care of any of them lived or died. <br/><br/>One can argue these movies don't need to elevate to Oscar performances and I would argue: it couldn't hurt. <br/><br/>So, with my disappointment of far too many ""Oh, look at what the monster did!five minutes ago"" and lack of depth in the acting, caused just a couple of bumps down in my rating. That said, it's absolutely worth the viewing and I cannot wait to see it again. <br/><br/>Now that I know what to expect and any previous expectations are extinguished, I think I might have an even better time with this production. <br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I am a huge Las Vegas fan. I visit there 3-4x/year and because of this, my friend and I had to laugh when a Las Vegas scene appeared. Not only did they show a devastated Las Vegas Blvd (or ""The Strip"") but the scene begins at the very hotel I booked for a mere week away from me seeing this movie: Caesars Palace! Not only that, of its five-six buildings, the one with the most damage (the building was cut in half) as they pan back, is the very building I am staying in – the Augustus Tower.<br/><br/>I don't care. Luck is on my side. I'm still going. And even if a giant monster did attack the Strip, then I might have most of the place to myself. Viva Las Vegas!"
"mdfaraone","7","2","5","16 May 2014"," an HONEST review by a lifelong Godzilla fan
","As a child of the 70s and 80s I grew up with the TOHO Godzilla movies, as a pre-teen Godzilla movies ( and dinosaurs) were my favorite type of movies, those of you from the east coast may remember the annual tradition of the Thanksgiving (and Friday after) Godzilla marathons on channel 9 in the late 70s early 80s. fast forward to 1998 and Roland Emmerich rapes my childhood memories,...nuff said about that debacle. Now fast forward again to 2014 and the Americans once again take on the legendary Big ""G"", can they finally get it right?.......well sort of. I'm not going to give you a play-by -play of the whole movie,too many other reviewers have already done that,..I'm going to tell you what you really need to know. Let's start with the good : Godzilla LOOKS pretty damn good (though the complaints of looking somewhat ""hefty"" have merit), and equally important they seem to have gotten the NATURE of the beast mostly correct, Godzilla is the anti-hero of the monster world, he is not evil,he is heroic, yet also indifferent to humankind. WHEN (and that's the key issue)you see Godzilla it is truly exhilarating and you really want to just stare in awe of this creature as long as possible. The monster fights are pretty good WHEN they are actually showing them, and let's face it ,that is what most of us really want in a Godzilla movie. This is definitely a ""movie theatre"" movie and should be seen on the biggest, loudest screen possible. Bryan Cranston is great for as long as you get to see him. That's about it for the good, it may not sound like much but it makes up for a lot of the bad and still justifies a ticket purchase.<br/><br/>Now to the bad: Way ,way ,waaaay too much buildup and not nearly enough payoff. Bryan Cranston's character and acting talents are completely squandered. At first you are sympathetic to the human element, but after almost 90 minutes and over 20 ""cutaways"" to the human scenes you start becoming downright bored and even resentful, to the point that you wish the MUTOS and Godzilla would wipe them all out already so we can focus on the monsters. Stupid Military dialogue. Only one species of MUTO. ......and now to biggest gripe of all........ Godzilla, the movies' namesake, the big ""G"", Gojira, King of all Monsters gets a whopping 10 minutes of screen time of an entire 2 hour movie,..and if you think I am exaggerating don't take my word, I want you to bring an actual stopwatch with you, start it when ""G"" is on screen and stop it at each cutaway when he is offscreen ,then check the total time when the movie ends. He gets about 1 minute midway through the movie at his introduction and about 9 minutes at the end (not counting the interspersed cutaways).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: as the saying goes ,you only get one chance to make a first impression, and director Gareth Edwards has somewhat squandered his by taking what could have been a ""Great"" movie and making it into a mere ""good"" one by being waaay too reserved with showing the monsters. It's still worthy of a viewing on the bigscreen, it's miles above the 98 version, it's fertile ground to make a much better sequel, but I really wish they could have gotten it right the first time around by giving us exactly what we came for......GODZILLA !!!!"

","Godzilla, the King of Monsters returns to the silver screen. Surprisingly , he himself didn't had much screen time to woo the audience. Even when he appears they cut to humans and other things leaving the viewers disappointing. This has been done many times in the film and it had an advantage of creating the tense but a regular fan boy might get disappointed of this style. The final battle was good and the film concluded in a good fashion though. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards tried to balance the human aspect and the monster-action but he was partly successful. He had put more efforts on the humans but they didn't have much to perform but only there to felt shocked and panicked. He teased the viewers and created the tension till the Big G's arrival which paid well for the initial half. He should have focused more on a compelling narration but he insisted more on creating the environment. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston performed well as Joe Brody and he carries the first part of the movie on his shoulders. Aaron Taylor-Johnson was good as Naval technician Ford and he performed well. Elizabeth Olsen as Ford's Wife didn't had much screen time. A good actor like Ken Watanabe was there only to stare at the consequences happening let alone performing. It's hard to have compelling characters when the film is based on a Monster but a even in a film like this has to have good characters for the viewers to connect. <br/><br/>The film was good at parts with more tension than action catching some viewers in this aspect but at the same time it leaves others who expect popcorn entertainment. It was good but not as good as we wanted it to be."

","*****SPOILER ALERT!!! As a die-hard fan of the old, exclusively Toho Godzilla, I felt the need to write an honest review which would voice my opinions of this new (and improved) entry into the Godzilla franchise.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying, I was not let down, far from it, however, there were some aspects of the movie which I think fell short. While the visuals were stunning and the fights, (when you got to them) breathtaking, I can't help but feel the plot focused too much on the human aspects of the story and led more to be desired of a Pacific Rim style face off between the monsters. This was a major issue with the slated American attempt at Godzilla in 1998 and I felt the issue beginning to resurface with this movie. I found that I didn't really care much for any of the human characters despite a few sob stories and I constantly wanted to see more of the monsters. I got more emotion out of the two M.U.T.O monsters than any of the human characters. Despite this, the humans hardships were at least somewhat realistic (unlike Pacific Rim) and helped maintain a gritty tone to the movie reminiscent of Gojira (1954).<br/><br/>Luckily, when the action did kick in towards the second half, we got to see the real goods. There were some scenes where I questioned the direction, but after some surprising twists and a riveting final showdown with some unexpected empathy towards Godzilla himself, I became totally immersed. If you're a fan of CGI, please go and see this movie! While the acting overall wasn't bad, there was some awkward dialogue and a distinct lack of Bryan Cranston. It becomes rather apparent, considering his role in a majority of the trailers, that he becomes no more than a reason for a lot of Breaking Bad fans to see the movie. There was an audible sigh/gasp from the audience upon realising our favourite actor won't be with us any longer. Focus then switches to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays Cranston's son. From here on we continue on a slightly bumpy ride featuring a few unnecessary additions to the plot in order to try and develop Johnson's character. Despite this, performances were solid, with some minor exceptions (Ken Watanabe's single facial expression and Cranston's questionable grasp of Japanese to name a couple), though I can't complain overall.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself was perfection. They got his characteristics spot on, even down to his famous atomic breath. If the movie had included or even hinted at a new version of the Gojira (1954) theme I would have died happy, but it was not to be. It is clear that the movie was made by and for Godzilla fans and stays true to a traditional Godzilla classic.

","Those seeking summer action film wham-bam-thank-you-mam blockbuster carnage from start to finish in Godzilla are going to be sorely disappointed with this new king of the monsters, but for those with appreciation for finely paced and well-staged action, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is going to prove highly entertaining and thoughtfully constructed despite not being exactly the hotly anticipated creature feature classic that many perhaps hoped it would be.<br/><br/>Quickly graduating from his debut made-for-under-a-million-dollars feature Monsters to a 160 million dollar large scale reboot of one of the most beloved cinema creations in history, Brit Gareth Edwards had a mighty large task in making a film that not only re-imagined Godzilla for modern audiences but provided heart and soul for the CGI wonderment to take place around and on that front he does a commendable job. Without wishing to spoil much of what occurs throughout the story, the film takes a pretty stock standard approach of distant family members pulling together in time of a world disaster and fills that out with some extremely basic supports from the grizzled military commander through to the token loyal wife and in the form of Ken Watanabe's scientist one of the most glazed over and gawking acting appearances of the year (seriously just count the times he stands around looking at something as though he has just been hit by a bad case of the stares). With a weak and underused support base Edwards does strike gold with the combo of Johnson and in particular Bryan Cranston who seems to be still on an acting high from his 5 season arc in Breaking Bad and here adds much needed gravitas to the human flavour of the piece, but in the end who really needs these humans when Godzilla is on the loose? <br/><br/>With the CGI star of the piece Godzilla a startling and impressive incarnation (even though the big fella seems to have a penchant for the odd lizard cheeseburger) it's safe to say this is where Edwards film comes into its own and becomes a must-see big screen adventure. With the films ample and sparingly used set pieces Edwards has proved that while he can handle the human element he excels at the popcorn munching extravagance even more so. Unwilling to spoil many of the films unique set ups it's safe to say there is enough jaw dropping imagery on display here to safely call Godzilla one of the most visually impressive films your likely to witness this year and while the film's most stunning set piece in the form of a military drop has been seen countless times in the films trailers and adverts there are many other moments of true epic nature to allow us to call this a feast for eyes. In a stage in motion pictures where CGI has reached all new levels of over-saturation it's a real joy to behold a film that seems to use its wizardry to realistic and stunning effects.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a finely crafted and immensely entertaining reboot of a franchise that perhaps many thought would now lay long dormant but thanks to Edwards deft touch you get the feeling once again that us mere mortals will be more than OK to see more of what is on display here and while Godzilla is in itself its own worst enemy, a film held back by a subject that can only take it so far there is little doubt that this big budget effort is about all you could ever want from a giant radiated lizard going about his business.<br/><br/>3 and a half jungle submarines out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"ConsciousConnor","4","32","197","8 May 2014"," Godzilla falls short
","I'm just back from the premiere and this is my initial thought. The film does not seem to get the feeling out of Godzilla. We don't feel for the monster like in King Kong. The movie is a terrible mess (not to say king kong is not). Three monsters fight, Vegas is destroyed, San Fran is destroyed, random trains are destroyed. Bryan Cranston is the father figure and his son (Aaron Johnson) don't have a good presence or connection. I believe Aaron Johnson was not the man for this part. He was to jar-head like and not bomb-diffuser like. And Bryan Cranston, I don't know why you did this movie. Are you just trying to make as much money as possible? Look, this is a typical monster movie. Is it worth a movie ticket? That depends on who you are. There is nothing redeeming with this Godzilla movie. We end up rooting for Godzilla in the end against these other two monsters, but why? Godzilla does not even have fire breath. It's nuclear blue. Why didn't the movie make the presence of Godzilla more of a backstory? Is he protecting Earth? The movie brushed over nature qualities of animals but again, really missed the opportunity to make something great. Many many people can make a movie, but only a few can make good movies. Pacific Rim was surprising to me. I dug that movie. This though, this is like Transformers 3."

","For the first time since seeing Avatar in the cinema, I found myself questioning whether or not to leave my seat half way through a film. <br/><br/>I managed to make it through the entire film for those concerned (only due to the fact that I had coughed up £10 for the 'pleasure' of doing so). <br/><br/>Considering the title of the film is 'Godzilla' you hardly see the terrifying creature. The majority of the movie is clogged up with poor story telling and confusing sub-plots. I found myself questioning whether Godzilla was the hero or the villain? (I think he's meant to be the hero?)<br/><br/>All in all the film is misleading by making us movie goers think that this is all about the 'King of Monsters' Godzilla, it's not. It's centered around Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character and his poor one dimensional acting. <br/><br/>If I had to compare Godzilla to anything else it would be World of the Worlds. Not because War of the Worlds is a poor film, I actually enjoyed it, it's because of the contrasting stories."

They were never dug deeper into a real theme of Godzilla, which is of course, nuclear problems.

","Contains spoilers!!! Was everyone hoping this new take was going to be to the famous Japanese monster, what ""Batman begins"" was to Batman? Because it really isn't! What a rancid disappointment it actually is. How could they have genuinely messed this up again?! I don't even know where to begin? <br/><br/>For starters I should probably ask what the hell is wrong with the ""critics"" that have been praising this disaster for being way better than the 1998 one? Thank God for websites where us normal folk can share our opinions. What exactly about this movie makes up for Ronald Emmerichs widely panned (though it too was bad) 1998 ""Godzilla"" exactly? From all I can see, these new guys have avoided the mistakes that movie made, in favour of ideas that are too obviously bad for even Ronald Emmerich to have made! <br/><br/>""Godzilla 2014"" promised us a Godzilla for the 21st Century. One that would look more like the original, fight other monsters, and even breath his infamously fiery breath! And on top of that a recently rediscovered great actor was hired (Bryan Cranston) to hopefully add some human drama to the proceedings.<br/><br/>So, what is this?!! (The Rest of this review contains unavoidable spoilers, that I have to include because I am THAT annoyed with this movie) Not only is Cranston ""disposed off"" early on. Too focus on the dorky adventures of the Wide eyed Mathew Broderick style kid from ""Kick-ass."" But just when I thought that they were making way for the real (giant lizard) star of the movie. HE BARELY FEATURES!!! Yes, there ARE giant monsters here. But I want Godzilla in a Godzilla movie! and I'm sure the fans and a majority of everyone else wants that too! <br/><br/>What really makes these huge glaring errors unforgivable in my opinion though, is the way in which this flick blatantly teases its audience into thinking our giant lizard is going to appear/fight these other monstrous beasts time and again, without actually doing it until the very end. Though the special effects are amazing I must agree. This doesn't matter when they're amazing in the wrong places! <br/><br/>The one I blame for this Godzilla mess (perhaps too much) is director Gareth Edwards. Hired off the back of the critically praised, though itself, dismally boring ""Monsters."" This guy seems to like leaving what we want from the movie till the last 5 minutes. Well, he's at least done it to me twice now, and I don't wish for him to do it a third time. He's already getting added to my most hated list. Hopefully his success is short lived after this film, and no doubt an M Night Shyamalan style career beckons.<br/><br/>Godzilla meanwhile, will no doubt have further adventures following the frankly depressing success of this one. He gets hailed as a hero at the end of the film for trashing the place, so maybe he'll come back and cause some proper destruction next time eh?"

","I must admit, I'm one of the rare ones who liked America's first attempt in adapting Gojirasan back in 1998. I saw it at the movies and it was awesome. But after seeing the 2014 version, I realize now how much that other one really sucked.<br/><br/>This movie goes further than just paying homage to the originally Giant monster. It's almost works as a reboot or even a sequel to the classic monster franchise. With CGI they manage to make the monster look similar to the guy in the monster suit, but at the same time showed animal movements. They gave us the best of both worlds.<br/><br/>After now 60 years, it's hard for anyone to be frighten of the greatest monster hero ever, yet the filmmakers managed to show how Terrifying being so low on the food chain can be. They did this by exploiting a world post 9/11. It's not hard for any one of us to imagine what it's like for a city to be devastated suddenly by an unknown menace, than your fears to be escalated when you realize what it is. Godzilla was not treated like a cartoon like they did in 98, people died in this flick attempting to battle the forces of nature. Lucky we have the troops to save us.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson really Kicked-Ass (who got that?) as the human protagonist whose story we follow through the movie. Still rippling with the guns he developed playing a super hero, he was a good combination of action and emotions as a soldier more interested with reuniting with his family, after a long stretch in the service, than battling a monster, but a soldier's got to do what a soldier's got to do. The movie has two crazed scientist in Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe who interesting enough, role in the movie was similar to that of Raymond Burr in the American English dub of the original film. I do wish that Elisabeth Olsen's role in the movie as a nurse and soldier's wife was a little better as I've become a fan of hers.<br/><br/>The movie also had an interesting surprise that I was not expecting so I will not be the one to say just in case you don't know, but like I said, the film acts more like a sequel than an adaptation.<br/><br/>First Pacific Rim and now Godzilla. The Giant monster is smashing and bashing it's way back into movie screens with a vengeance. Go see it in IMAX."

","*No spoilers*<br/><br/>OK, to start off I just want to start with the hype this film I felt had. I went to the cinema today expecting a lot more than what the trailers gave, and although the trailers were good I don't think the film was anything that is ground breaking. The CGI is brilliant, I feel the movie was definitely more focused around the visual effects and sound, which is true but I felt there was something that was missing. If you go to see this with the idea like I had that it is going to be great you will feel slightly disappointed. There were quite a few very good scenes in the movie that had you on the edge of your seat but overall I feel that after a hour this became slightly dull; I also thing it wasn't put together as well as it could have been but needless to say it is a very good movie, it just needed a bit of tidying up. The acting isn't too bad, for example everyone's favourite Walter White from Breaking Bad did a good job to try and put across how serious it actually was, but the other characters aren't so great.<br/><br/>Overall the film is entertaining and a good watch, if you are into very well made special effect movies and monster movies then this is for you.<br/><br/>Saw in 3D at the Odeon in Brighton"

","This is definitely a better version in term of everything, except that it is presented in a serious tone from the beginning till the end. It might not as epic as 1954's version, but it has successfully made Emmerich's version back in 1999, which has a silly monster looking like a chicken little running across a city. Director Edwards has implemented the film brilliantly with excellent scientific theories, which requires audiences to pay close attention to conversations, characters development, outstanding CGIs, stunning visual effects which is on par with destruction as per in 2012, as well as powerful scores and cinematography efforts. The film has turned into an entertaining adventure which brings a strong message that human is not intelligent enough to control the nature and creations of God."
"chris-goutzos-cg","8","3","10","17 May 2014"," A great film for fans of Godzilla or of good sci-fi action movies.
","What can I say about this film? On the one hand it has some very strong points but on the other it really lacks. <br/><br/>First of all it is clear for whom this film was written; mostly for Godzilla fans. And it is very successful at that. We all remember that horrendous remake in 1998 and it is great to see Godzilla as we all want to see him, great, massive, destructive and radioactive (yep he is finally laser-breathing again).<br/><br/>However, this movie wasn't just faithful to the original, it was its own story and a surprisingly good one. It is true that the science behind it doesn't make any sense, as many people have complained about, but did anyone expect anything different? Admittedly the plot is at times hard to follow but there only very few potholes or inconsistencies, something rare in such an ambitious movie that wants to take risks but also be taken seriously. Anyway, the storyline is pretty interesting, almost believable and realistic. Another great thing of course is all the visual. We get some great fight scenes, impressive CGI and some simply awesome visual (admit it, you were amazed at the scene where the soldiers were jump out of the plane).<br/><br/>Now some of the bad stuff. The acting is quite forgettable. We get a few talented actors but even they fail to deliver. It is clear that they all are two dimensional and there this little to no character development. However, this shouldn't matter because Godzilla is what the movie focuses on, right? Well, it seems that we all agree that there wasn't enough Godzilla in the movie. Instead we are introduced to two new monsters, which even though are pretty cool, are not and should not be our story's focus. Finally, another thing that many people complained about are the fight scenes. The CGI is of course perfect but many say that the fight scenes, and generally the whole movie, are not action packed. I couldn't agree more. The point is, though, that many people expected to see another Pacific rim, while this movie has a completely different point of view on a similar theme. It is more serious and ambitious and tries not to be a simple B list action flick.<br/><br/>So, in general, is Godzilla worth watching? I think it certainly is. Even though it has some weaknesses it is still a great film, depending of course on what you are watching it for. It gives as an interesting and comprehensive story, some outstanding visual images, suspense and amazing fight scenes. It is the perfect chance to relive the original Godzilla (modernised and improved) or simply be appropriately introduced to the ""Godzilla-world"" (without that awful 1998 version)."

"CinemaClown","Null","3","11","24 May 2014"," Godzilla the Monster Ruled. Godzilla the Movie Didn't.
","After the disaster that was Roland Emmerich's version of Godzilla, for which the son of a bitch isn't even sorry, this 60th anniversary feature is the 2nd coming of the giant monster & is supposedly the reboot of Godzilla film franchise. Set in contemporary timeline, it depicts Godzilla as ""a terrifying force of nature"" who is pitted against malevolent creatures who for years have been feeding on nuclear radiations but now threaten the very existence of humanity. But the bigger question is whether it resurrects the legacy of the King of the Monsters and the answer to it is both yes & no.<br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards uses the same formula that he applied in his debut feature, Monsters, only for it to not work in the end. Too much time is devoted to the human drama which really wouldn't have been a problem if by any means it was interesting or properly executed. Also, he's able to build up the tension but then cuts it just when it's getting more exciting, leading to frustration on the part of viewers. And the humour is absent to give an impression of a serious film but the script adds nothing to that aspired seriousness, thus leaving the drama pretty hollow.<br/><br/>Still, barring one aspect, the technical filmmaking is worthy of all the praise. Art direction meticulously designs, details & renders the creatures on the screen. Cinematography expertly manages to create an aura of impending doom. VFX is as spectacular as the titular character itself while sound is easily the movie's most impressive aspect. Editing, however, isn't up to the mark but the background score by Alexandre Desplat is just the way it should be in this movie; majestic, imposing & grandeur.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Godzilla features an unusual cast in Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins & others. And I've no idea what the hell they signed up for because acting certainly isn't what they do here. For the majority of its runtime, all they do is simply stare with their blank faces & dropped jaws and are completely clueless about what's expected from their characters. The only exception is Bryan Cranston who delivers an energetic performance but then his role is short-lived.<br/><br/>This movie promised to bring the 'King of the Monsters' right from its origins while also keeping its look & style faithful to its depiction in the original Japanese film. And to that, it delivers. Apart from few modifications, the overall appearance of Godzilla is mostly in tune with its iconic look plus its distinctive roar & signature weapon are also in tact. Still, its role is reduced to an extended cameo as the 1st half doesn't tease us with Godzilla's presence but this giant monster is virtually absent from the scene. And when it finally shows up, it happens simply out of nowhere.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Gareth Edwards' Godzilla had the potential to be 'The Movie of the Summer' but thanks to its mediocre direction, uninspired screenplay, terrible characterization, dull performances, messed-up editing & lack of substance, it doesn't live up to its hype. Still, what works ends up working pretty well in here & considering today's mainstream audience's taste in films, most of them are gonna come out pretty satisfied in the end anyway. To summarize the movie in a sentence, Godzilla did rise but it didn't rise enough.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

","The stench of Emmerich's 1998's GODZILLA remake has been permeating in my nostrils for 16 years, so when I heard that Gareth Edwards was going to attempt a serious new 2014 reboot with Godzilla more or less resembling himself, I figured I'd give it a try. Besides, Toho Studios in Japan hasn't made a new Godzilla picture in something like 10 years... so what's the worst that could happen? If this new version flops at the box office, Godzilla remains dormant. If it succeeds, the possibilities are endless - perhaps even for Toho to return to their own series. So I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>The new GODZILLA doesn't suck as hard as the '98 remake did, but it still does nibble quite a bit. The main problem is that it takes forever for Godzilla to appear - something for like one hour into this bloated 123 minute feature. Now, I've always been a viewer who mostly prefers fleshed-out characters and intriguing story development over all-out brainless action ... but this is a Godzilla movie, damn it! I didn't check the time, but I wonder if Godzilla was seen on screen for 10 minutes total; it was like he was giving a cameo appearance in his own movie. And if you're going to attempt a dramatic first act or two with characters in an action-oriented premise, you'd better make them interesting. Unfortunately, the leads here are strictly one-dimensional. As the young lead hero, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is an expressionless cardboard cut-out. His wife (Elizabeth Olsen) does not make much deeper of an impression. The lead Japanese doctor (Ken Watanabe) barely has much to do other than stand around looking seriously constipated. (Of course, they couldn't help naming the token Japanese doctor ""Serizawa"", after a character in the original 1954 GODZILLA; why do these makers of lesser reboots always think they're going to score points by name-checking people and things from older movies?). There were some semi-interesting early sequences featuring Bryan Cranston as the young hero's dad, but even he began to wear on my nerves after awhile.<br/><br/>Twice I seriously considered walking out of the theater. The first time was after squirming too long in waiting for Godzilla to show his face (seemed like an hour, or longer); the second time was, after finally seeing him, getting continuously c**k-teased -- more than once, when it appeared as though an enticing action moment was mercifully about to begin, but the scene abruptly cuts away to something else, as if slamming a door in the audience's faces (and that literally happened during one crucial cutaway moment of excitement!). While I think of it, isn't it quite a coincidence how the main characters always seem to be right there each time a building falls or a monster sticks its head forward? It's also a small world even amongst hundreds of scattered victims, as they still manage to find their missing loved one amidst the hysteria.<br/><br/>Some good things: first, I think it was wise to not make this another ""origin movie""; instead, it's as if Godzilla has always existed, but has been laying low for many years. Which leads me to the second good thing: having Godzilla awaken as a helper to mankind (I've always felt that a typical scenario with a villainous Godzilla angrily smashing the city gets tired really fast after one film). Third: having two other evil monsters for Godzilla to battle with -two gigantic, robot-like, insect-beasties (one male, one female). When these three monsters are ultimately allowed to tussle together, this resembles a true Godzilla movie and the effects are quite spectacular; regrettably, by this time it's too late. It's what we came here for, but there are times in viewing cinema where a plodding movie has over-stepped its welcome and is beyond total redemption. *1/2 out of ****"
"Hyperboievr","10","3","11","17 May 2014"," A grand and worthy addition to Godzilla's longtime legacy.
","Godzilla. I will approach this objectively now. This will be a long review since it's a movie I've anticipated so heavily:<br/><br/>Was it worth all of the anticipation and hype? In short, YES. Is it a perfect movie? NO. I'm not going to sit here and sing its praises as if it there's nothing wrong. So let's get what's wrong out of the way first:<br/><br/>The script (while sometimes smart) REALLY bogs the movie down during its middle act. Some cheesy lines (that were fun but clashed with the overall serious tones) here and there, and don't get me started on the military incompetence clichés that run rampant through the middle act. Yes, I will say it now that it would have been nicer to have more Godzilla. I'll get to that later though. The music was a little dodgy and I would have preferred something moodier. The soundtrack aimed to echo the works of Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube, but unfortunately it fails and doesn't elevate the film (except for some moments). Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance was serviceable at best in my opinion. Some of the incredible talent in the cast is wasted but I can't say much without spoiling. Basically it makes the film feel like it is separated into acts. Overall the biggest drawback here isn't the human characters so much as the script. There's a lot to nitpick about.<br/><br/>As for what's good about it Well, there's much to say here. Bryan Cranston is awesome in the movie. Ken Watanabe was pretty good and probably my favorite character. The cinematography... I'm in love. When I heard they were going to get the same guy who was the DP on The Avengers, I thought this movie would fall into generic visual territory but my goodness was this movie a visual treat. Even the more intimate character moments were enhanced by the camera-work. It's a beautiful marriage of steady wide-shots, POVs, and smart use of hand-held camera-work. The CGI is top-shelf. The monsters move around with a good presence. <br/><br/>There isn't as much Godzilla in this movie as you'd probably expect, and that is the most interesting aspect about this film. There's plenty of screen time for the monsters in general and there is a lot of action, but not so much Godzilla in his full glory. There is a strong human focus. You're introduced to his opponent first, and you see Godzilla when he shows up to set things straight. If this structure doesn't sound familiar to you, then you mustn't have seen many Godzilla movies at all. After seeing the film again, without any bias, I can say that it's much harder for me to relate to the complaints about the title monster not being in the film enough. To me, this slow burn was just a little exaggerated and actually works given how stunning the final climax of the film is. Seriously, probably the greatest monster throw-down I've ever seen. It's a payoff that wouldn't excite audiences as much as it did in both screenings I've attended if it was milked throughout the film (seriously, people were cheering and clapping when Godzilla showed up). When you see Godzilla in this film, he's glorious, and it's because of that slow buildup. Unfortunately now I have a strange assumption that modern audiences get bored too easily. This is what made movies like Jurassic Park and Alien so great.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that they got Godzilla right this time. The movie is a throwback to all the great monster movies of the 70's and 80's, but with some gritty Nolan attitude added in there. Most importantly, this movie was made for the fans, as it feels like a genuine Toho film. Perhaps it caters a bit more to the fans than it should (the script really is poor on multiple levels, bringing to mind B-Movie level cheese and stupid plot points on occasion), but ultimately Godzilla delivers the most exciting spectacle I've seen all year (Halo jump sequence, I'm pointing at you) and I can't be happier with how the film turned out. I'd highly recommend you see it on the biggest screen possible. There's a lot to commend about what Gareth Edwards has pulled off here, despite some shortcomings. 8.5/10"
"Filvies144","3","2","6","21 November 2014"," lame and tedious
","This movie was a huge waste of time! It was really boring in the start of the movie and it goes really off topic of ''Godzilla'' at one point. I was excited for this movie, and it was really disappointing. It was only two hours, but the movie from start to finish felt like 3 hours. Plus,Godzilla only makes an appearance for little time, so this shouldn't be called Godzilla. I would highly recommend Million dollar arm if you want to watch a 2014 movie. That's much better than this piece of junk! For the 2nd Godzilla coming out in 2018, they should hire a new director, a new producer, and some new script writers to change the movie so that it's not so boring and actually has more action. This film should be called ''Borezilla'' <br/><br/>PS: (If you like this movie, please don't be offended;its my opinion)"
"thegene-2","2","2","6","21 October 2014"," Great Godzilla movie - NOT
","I settled in to watch what I expected to be a great movie. AT 71 and a viewer of many Godzilla movies, as I like monster movies and Godzilla is a classic one, I was expecting this one to be even better than the Matthew Broderick one which I like very very much. I have never written a review that I could only find one redeeming thing about it. Until now that is. This movies has but one and only one good thing I can say about it. And that is that it is (a little) better in special effects than the very old Godzilla movies out of Japan. MUSIC–I guess there was music though the movie was so bad that I paid little attention to it as I spent most of my time trying to figure out what was going on. SCENERY–Most of it was showing destroyed major cities. Not all that neat to look at. CONCEPT–My mind kept trying to understand all the totally impossible things that were taking place. I will not spoil the movie for those that want to see it, as there must be some redeeming qualities since it gets over a 6 rating on IMDb, but that sure makes me wonder if maybe there was some built in subliminal messages at the theater showings that told people what they were watching was not all that bad. BASIC STORY–Well, the movie did not explain much of what was going on to help me even to begin to understand the many elements of the story. Without background information and relatable context, much of what went on just seemed like random happenings. ACTING–This was for the most part like reading a line and getting out to go eat. I won't say it is as bad as watching high school kids acting (though some of them are pretty good) but for sure no one is going to win any awards – or even be nominated. To give you an idea of it all, I will just say that one of the main character's spent most of the movie making faces and not talking. He was good at that but I was watching the movie for entertainment and he was not that entertaining. SPECIAL EFFECTS– There was so much wrong here that it almost killed the movie for me. It showed lots of destruction but not the destruction taking place. Thus, the part that made sense was left out, which makes no sense. It looked like in a lot of cases they were trying to put so much into the special effect that it made my mind jumble to the point that if would eventually just shut done when it continued to happen. GODZILLA–This is the main character. Is not the movie called GODZILLA? Maybe the movie should be called MISSING GODZILLA since he was seen very little. It took forever for him to come on scene and when you saw him you almost felt like that they went to the person that designed the original one for the Japanese movies and asked him to do the design. In the rare parts that you could really see him, he looked like a man in a Godzilla suit walking – which is probably what it was. FIGHT SCENES–These were pitiful. I would like to say that they were at least doing a ROPE-A-DOPE, but they would show a few seconds and then cut away to something else and you were not sure what was going on. What they did show was almost pitiful in special effects, and often either too dark to see or too far away or too much background that they blended in and you could not focus on them. I am not against movies that use jumping forward or backward in time (like saying 13 years later or 5 years earlier), but there needs to be a solid tie between the parts. I must have blinked as that sure seemed to be missing for me. There was far too much going on most of the time to be able to understand a lot about what was going on. That destroys a movie for me. Of course I suppose it gets a high rating because there are a lot of people that just like Godzilla . I ended up watching the whole show as I knew I was going to write a review on it and I actually expected it to get better as it went along. It didn't. In all fairness I guess I could watch the movie over and over and probably get more of a sense of what was going on, but that has one glaring problem. And that is that I would have to watch the movie. I gave the movie a 2. One point for being a Godzilla and one point for special effects being better than the original Godzilla. I suppose if this would have been just a monster movie and I had never seen a Godzilla move I would have given it a higher rating, but I don't believe it would be all that much higher. I guess I could compare it to a bunch of the older Godzilla movies and it would get a higher rating as well, but again, I can't see how that be much higher. Maybe that is what they were trying to do. Film one just like in the olden days with the technology available today. Now if that was their goal I would probably give it a lot higher rating, like a 4 maybe. BOTTOM LINE – If you expect to see a modern day Godzilla movie with good modern special effects and a story line that is good, acting that is good, and all the other components that make a movie good, do not waste your time. If you are interested in how not to make a Godzilla move, then your time will not be wasted if you watch it."
"zhoufengrong","3","2","6","1 October 2014"," Just Another Disaster Movie
","This is not a kaiju movie. Despite having giant monsters and scenes of civilization being devastated, these are just the backdrop for the human characters as they struggle to survive. Replace Godzilla with a volcano, tsunami, asteroid, or any other random catastrophic event and the movie would not change. Unacceptable. I went into this movie somewhat hopeful despite having heard the negative criticism because I love Godzilla. I was thoroughly disappointed. To give credit where credit is due: the CG effects were well done. If you have no love for giant monsters and just want to see The Day After Tomorrow or Dante's Peak again, then by all means go for it."
"XweAponX","10","2","6","23 September 2014"," A lot better than the more Neanderthal reviewer's have said
","It is not perfect, but what movie is? Even the Lord of the rings trilogy had a couple of spots that were kind of rough. Speaking of which, special-effects genius Jim Rygiel returns to give us his visual interpretation of Godzilla and Motu.<br/><br/>I'll add this: I really liked in the 1998 version as well, because I believed it was New York City's turn to be smashed into tiny pieces of rubble.<br/><br/>For too many years Tokyo has been the main recipient of Godzilla, Mothra, and all of the rest of the monsters attentions. It is time for new cities to be totally rubble-Ized, and in this film it is Janjira, Japan; Honolulu, Hawaii; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Canada, Er, I mean San Francisco. In this film once again Vancouver, British Columbia becomes the ""virtual"" San Francisco.<br/><br/>Therefore, because most of the action occurs in San Francisco, Er, I mean Canada, this television show, Er I mean movie appears to be a reunion of Stargate-Atlants-SGU-1 Guest actors and actresses including Jill Teed of Wormhole Xtreme. You will see the Russian ""General Chekov"" speaking to Bryan Cranston at the beginning of this film, on the USS Saratoga you will see the girl who played the Comms officer in the Stargate SG-1 episode ""Prometheus"", when they try to take the A-for-Atom-Bomb Train to San Francisco you will see one of the Goa'Uld system lords from Stargate SG-1, in Oakland you will see the actor who played a younger version of a General Hammond from the episode ""1969"", and there are a few more faces dropped in here and there for effect ending with Jill teed as Liz Olson's friend.<br/><br/>That is mostly why I enjoyed this movie, even though it was good enough even without all of my favorite Canadian actors doing cameos.<br/><br/>The imagery is realistic even though the plot line if any does seem to jump around a lot and these monsters, these huge monsters seem to easily get from Japan to California in 60 seconds flat, who cares about any of this? It is a form of nitpicking I do not participate in. I enjoyed it, it was a good movie. And the fact that more and more of these negative reviews are written by people who just happened to join IMDb to write only one review of one movie makes them not valid at all, I don't even read them."

","Godzilla: Worst movie of 2014?! Go (censored)!!! This was the best Godzilla movie ever! No I won't be expecting any Oscars anytime soon. I'm not that far off or delusional, but considering what they had to work with to begin with? They did an insanely good job! I'm a Godzilla freak! Very well acquainted with the genre. This movie is sure as heck 10 times better than that stupid giant iguana Matthew Broderick lizard movie. What you have to understand is this is based on the later Godzilla genre (may be the reason people hate it). In later Japanese films Godzilla, with all his monstrous capability actually became the hero. Almost to the point to where it became really corny and sappy. Heck even back in Godzilla verses the Smog Monster - very creepy and graphic for this kind of movie (gave me nightmares as a kid dead body parts and everything) - at the end I think they have the little boy running after Godzilla thanking him for saving them. This Godzilla 2014 movie is based on THIS genre of Godzilla movie... but without the stupid sappiness. It's sort of this genre fused with Godzilla 'King of the Monsters' - loved that chyron (homage) on the news feed by the way. Anyway, whoever worked on this script, oh holy **** am I impressed. Because of how much they toned it down, yet still kept the essence of this, without ever coming out and flat out saying it. Doesn't mean he doesn't tear crap down and kill people, lots of people... Just realized some of the quotes...Oh holy ****, this movie bloody nailed it Hollywood style! If you're not a Godzilla freak and/or a Hollywood wannabe you're probably just not going to understand. Whoever put this story together... does understand!... Time for me to go check 'the numbers'. Prob. failed like EV on the Snake River... Awesome, the haters are wrong. I'm right. It made money.

Even the 1998 Godzilla was better than this one, at least it was entertaining and had some humor to it. I fell asleep during this train of boredom that never changed tracks...<br/><br/>1. How can you make a Godzilla movie that Godzilla (the title monster!!!) has less screen time than lame (and over-used) cockroaches and bad acting? 2. Then you figure in all the dark lighting, dust, and fog. Just so it's cheaper to pay the CGI companies. Seriously!!! If you put the money and effort into making a great kick-ass Kaiju movie you'd get return fans... Look at Pacific Rim! Great Movie, great action, plenty of huge fight scenes. Goal!!! I wouldn't Watch Godzilla 2014 again unless I was taken prisoner, strapped to a chair, and my eyes were taped open.<br/><br/>Acting = 4 flat. Nobody even cares what happens to them and generally just get ticked that they are taking scene time.<br/><br/>Picture = 4 Would have been better if they put a guy in a big rubber suit and smashed a bunch of cheap miniature buildings (and they would have saved some money).<br/><br/>Bottom line. It would have been better to make a cheapo classic Godzilla movie with 1/4 the budget and they would have made more money.

I get the symbolism of Godzilla with the Hiroshima bombings and I do think that it's quite thoughtful, but as a piece of cinema, it's never come to par. This is no better than the infamous 1998 version, in fact, it might be worse. While that film was tonally all over the place, this one has none. Never have a seen a brilliant cast so utterly wasted. Maybe Gareth Edwards was just intimidated by them but he didn't seem to give them much to do. They just stand there clueless, Ken Watanabe being the biggest sinner of this, or deliver some dry exposition. The only actor given something is Bryan Cranston, but his storyline is so saccharine that it's hard to take seriously, as hard as he may try to make it work. He can't help but feel incredibly insignificant in light of the inevitability of what's to come.<br/><br/>Naturally, something like this will be terribly contrived, but even its optional choices such as the point where it tries to communicate that Aaron Johnson is a good guy by having him babysit a lost child just doesn't work because of the limited exploration of the narrative. If you were in that situation, then you'd get off at the next station and get the next train back. No way does that train go nonstop until nightfall. But that's beside the point, these things feed into character choices that are completely vapid. It's like a committee has decided what things should be and too often came up with a deadlock so they decided nothing will do instead. It has a huge problem with juggling the way humans would actually respond to this. Instead of awe-spiring wonder, it's vague terror at first and then a whole lot of gormlessness. It's eye-rolling, especially when they end up quite casual about what's going on.<br/><br/>However, the biggest problem is that it's void of atmosphere. The smaller scenes don't blend well with the bigger unconvincing CGI and it never has any cinematic texture which could so easily come. Instead, it shrouds us in the dark and our imaginations run distracted and bored. I laughed at the first reveal of Godzilla. And then the film wraps up by calling it a hero, as if we'd jump to such conclusions, and then it struts out of town like it knows it's a stud. Just a total joke that lacks all vision. It just doesn't mean anything or have anything moving or entertaining. At least Desplat's score is quite nice for what it is. Exciting marketing really mislead us with this one because they spent way too much time polishing the posters and the hype than working on this film. I'm sure Gareth Edwards is better than this and I will certainly give his Monsters a chance at some point, but this is a passionless misfire.<br/><br/>4/10"

A prologue set in 1999 sees scientist Dr Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) discovering a vastly huge skeleton in the Philippines, returning to the nuclear power plant he works we are introduced to Joe Brody (Cranston) who witnesses the complete and utter devastation of a nuclear meltdown losing his wife in the event. Fast forward 15 years and we now see his young son (not so young now) Ford Brody (Taylor-Johnson) returning home after a tour with the US Navy.<br/><br/>Joe Brody continues to obsess over the incident 15 years earlier, still living in Japan, the vast differing elements of the lives between Joe and Ford set up the tone for the emotion you're about to experience throughout the film. The film is very emotionally driven and we see this from the get go, Craston delivers some of the beautifully tragic moments we have came to expect from a man of his calibre, however the film is set down a bit in the female department, not by the actresses themselves, just that they are not given nearly enough screen time to act that especially goes for Elizabeth Olsen. Sally Hawkins is given a bit more screen time, however not much acting is needed she is just spouting out scientific jargon.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrays some nicely acted scenes, playing the very convincing Naval commanding role. Leaving the film without any out and out human hero, but the same can be said about having no human villain.<br/><br/>We are made to wait a fair amount of time before we get to see a look at the ""man"" we all came to see, the titular character. There was a wonderful piece I loved, in which it cuts to a TV news report and you see the action on a small screen there buy you feel the destruction still. Some people didn't enjoy this criticising him using this small scale idea with his huge budget, I for one commend it, was a brilliant scene.<br/><br/>Edwards use of the small scale reveals helps build up the tension, which in turn results in seeing the monster and you instantly remember all the small scale stuff and fall in love even more. You see the jagged spikes, peaking the surface of the sea and you know you're mere seconds away from one of the best monster reveals ever. Then for them small brief moments you see him in all his glory you know it's right, he's a pure animalistic beast as you want from Godzilla not a rip off T-Rex.<br/><br/>Overall I was very impressed with the scale of the film and what Edwards was able to do given this was his first cross over into the big budget blockbusters. He does stay true to his POV based work using visors, cameras and even car windscreens to immerse you in the film. However I will say given this was a Godzilla film he does come across as a supporting character to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, this may leave some audience members dismayed, you just have to appreciate climatic moments and feel their significance when they happen.<br/><br/>My MAIN complaint is that hiring an actor like Bryan Cranston, and killing him off before the hour mark was a HUGE let down, that for me took away from the whole film, Cranston is by far the best talent but wasn't given enough time for you to fall in love with. If they were to have given Cranston a bigger role in the film I would have given it a higher rating, but for me it just lacked that."

","Godzilla (2014)is an amazingly fun movie that washes away the bad memories from 1998.<br/><br/>It has a strong start and an awesome ending that respects but surpasses the older Toho classics in my opinion.<br/><br/>The middle 20 minutes period is a bit slow but it gives the movie a good pacing between the action scenes.<br/><br/>Great effects.

","With his first Monsters, Gareth Edwards proved that he is a capable and inventive film-maker, and it was very pleasing to see Hollywood recognise this so quickly and give him a shot at a major motion picture so early in his career. Edwards has rewarded that confidence by bringing all the skills apparent in his guerrilla debut to a very large property indeed, and making a highly accomplished and enjoyable film. Godzilla has, of course, seen numerous interpretations over the years, but Edwards' take is still fresh. He recognises that the human aspect is how the audience relates to the film and its hero, and there is no better actor working today at carrying the audience's empathy than Bryan Cranston, whose presence and performance ensures that the viewer is on board. The relationship conveyed by Cranston and Juliett Binoche in a few short minutes of screen time is immediately convincing and provides an emotional platform for the film. It's a pity that Aaron Taylor-Johnson does not seem capable of taking this emotion forward, and his stock action protagonist and relationship with his doctor wife Elizabeth Olsen is the most disappointing aspect of the film. Thankfully, we need not dwell on this, as the main event is Edwards' highly effective handling of the monsters. Their design is excellent, clearly the subject of careful consideration, but Edward's peerless talent is in his recognition that these creatures are governed by the same biological imperatives as humans - eat, reproduce and compete. The Mutos' laying waste to human cities is just a by-product of this,. It is the key to the film's success, and the reason Godzilla deserves to be seen, as much for the monstrous performances as the human ones."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","6","28 June 2014"," Some baffling storytelling decisions in this one
","A Godzilla movie that only shows Godzilla in brief establishing shots and then veers away when the action is really starting, only to cut back to the aftermath of the said action. It's like the film makers were trying to emulate the old Godzilla movies without realizing that the film makers back then would have liked to show more Godzilla, they just didn't have the budget for it. Hence the cuts.<br/><br/>So yeah, the film doesn't exactly deliver like it's supposed to with this kind of budget and expertise. I wouldn't even mind, but we just saw Pacific Rim last summer, a far superior monster film by far. This film spends way too much time following around these soldiers opposing Godzilla and the other monsters, than it does showing us these monsters. I literally had to pick up my jaw a couple of times. So baffling were these focus choices.<br/><br/>And yet, it does work, kind of. Because the film starts out phenomenally well. The suspense builds up slowly, the mood and the atmosphere are both bleak, intense and dark, the setting is introduced with care and we actually get some really good characters and character moments. Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody is a great character and I'd have loved for this movie to be solely about him, and perhaps Ken Watanabe. But then we start to focus more on Brody's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Godzilla shows up, turns out to be a big disappointment and it all spirals downhill from there.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film. A disappointing one, yes, but it has enough bang for your buck. The first act is great and whenever the actual monsters are on screen, the film immediately picks up in quality. If only they had had the sense to not shy away from the monster, this could have been an excellent movie. Now it's merely average."

","To say I was excited for the new Godzilla reboot would be an understatement. No film has brought out the inner-child in me for quite a long time, and well, this one succeeded on all levels. Not only is it a fantastic reboot of a 60-year-old franchise, but it is an astounding piece of filmmaking that is surely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time. <br/><br/>Throughout the film we mostly the Brody family, comprising of Joe (Bryan Cranston), Sandra (Juliette Binoche), Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and Elle (Elizabeth Olson) as they each struggle with their own dilemmas in the fight against Godzilla and the other monsters. On the other hand we have Ken Watanabe playing Dr. Serizawa, an ode to the character in the original 1954 film, and Sally Hawkins as his partner Vivienne.<br/><br/>The film essentially follows the narrative structure of Jaws, as well as the original Gojira, which means that we get teases and tastes of Godzilla and the other monsters throughout the film without showing us too much of what will inevitably come. The monsters in this movie look menacing and awe-inspiring; there were multiple times where my jaw actually dropped. Godzilla is bigger than ever, supposedly reaching 350 ft, the largest incarnation ever, and he also features a terrifying new look. The first time we see the full stature and we hear that classic roar, I got chills. It was magnificent in the way they built up the anticipation, and much like the marketing campaign, it really pays off in the final battle scenes.The CGI and sound effects in this film are top-notch, and seeing it in IMAX truly amplifies these to an even higher level. Much of this can be owed to director Gareth Edwards, who prefers to direct smart instead of explosive, that is until the absolutely destructive finale.<br/><br/>While there is a lot of focus on these monsters in attempts to make them interesting, the human characters feel rather bland. Ford is a soldier who simply cannot find his way home, and a lot of his material is not anything new or exciting. Most of the time I was focusing on Godzilla fighting in the background of the scene instead of caring what he was up to. His wife, Elle, is really an unimportant character in the film. She only serves as something for Ford to get back to instead of carrying any weight. Most of her scenes comprise of her running in fear and crying about her missing husband.<br/><br/>Dr. Serizawa however is one who sees good in Godzilla. While many were trying to kill him, he sees a sort of anti-hero in him. He also utters the best line in the movie, but I won't ruin that for you.<br/><br/>Now, most summer blockbusters feature a lot of explosions and action and whatnot. Godzilla does not disappoint in that. It does however contain some of the best acting thanks to some early scenes involving Bryan Cranston who surely steals the spotlight until Godzilla shows up. His performance is so powerful and heartbreaking, you almost forget that this is a Godzilla movie. It is a testament to his abilities of an actor to create a truly interesting and heartbreaking character based simply on his performance in a movie that does not focus heavily on human characters.<br/><br/>In the end, Godzilla is a phenomenal film. While the human characters may be poorly written at times, let me ask you this: are you really going to a Godzilla movie because you truly care about what the humans are doing? With its immense destruction, totally awesome monsters, and a couple scenes of heart-wrenching acting, it stands out as one of the best blockbusters this year, as well as a stellar reboot to a franchise that has seen its fair share of ups and downs.

"NickMullins","4","2","6","13 June 2014"," Want a good monster movie? Stick with Pacific Rim
","First of all I should say that in general I am not a ""monster movie' fan. I watched Pacific Rim and thought it was just ""O.K"". However when I heard who was directing Godzilla I got excited. I have great respect for Gareth Edwards and thought that if anyone could make a good American version of Godzilla; he could. And my excitement only grew after reading the awesome reviews for it. Unfortunately after seeing it in theaters with a few friends I have to say that honestly this is the biggest disappointment in theaters of 2014. Now don't misunderstand me, this movie does have its good parts, but they are out-weighed by the negative parts. I'll go through both the positive and negative parts, but in the end you'll just have to decide for yourself. <br/><br/>1. Story 7/10 OK so I want to be clear that the story is not where this movie goes wrong. Without spoiling, the movie has an enjoyable plot. As far as monster movies go this one isn't particularly stupid. It's not exactly ""Inception"" but its not as basic and straight forward as ""Pacific Rim"". But what made Pacific Rim good was that it didn't take its self seriously, so it was really enjoyable and could be stupid without pretending to be serious and smart. Even though Godzilla isn't completely stupid it takes itself way to seriously. <br/><br/>2. Visuals 7/10 There's nothing really that wrong with the visual effects in this movieI mean they aren't exactly super original, everyone already knows what Godzilla looks like. All the CGI is pretty decent, the monsters attacking Godzilla aren't exactly exciting, but they are passable. The main thing this movie has going for it in the visuals department is the lighting, the lighting, although pretty unrealistic is very cool looking and stylish, so as far as visuals gono big complaints. <br/><br/>3.Acting/Characters 5/10 This is were I start having problems with the movieThe acting and characters. Now Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a good actor, but the character he portrays is your average good looking muscled but rather bland main character. I really wish that the movie had put some effort to having original and enjoyable characters instead of the cliché lead that they chose. The rest of the characters are just as clichéd as the lead the smart scientistthe doctor for a wife the cute kidnone of them particularly good actors, EXCEPT for Bryan Cranston. I expected his character to be forced in just to sell tickets, but I found that he was the strongest both in acting and in character. In the short time that he is on screen you really feel sympathy for him. Another enjoyable character is that of his Bryan Cranston's character's wife, played by Juliette Binoche. Like Cranston, the short time she is on screen she shows a great performance. Unfortunately aside from the two strong performances, the rest of the characters are cliché and disappointing. <br/><br/>4. Directing/Pacing 3/10 Ahh yes, here we go. This is where this movie really falls apart. Its also the most disappointing part of this movie, as I said before, I really liked Gareth Edwards. <br/><br/>This movie does start off pretty well, Cranston and Binoche really draw you in. But as soon as the first 20 minutes are up the movie completely falls apart. I think that the main problem is it acts as if no one in the audience knows who Godzilla is or what he looks like. So they seem to be building up to make Godzilla's appearance startling and shocking. If I didn't know anything about Godzilla that would have been fine, but even though I have never seen any of the older original Japanese Godzilla's I still know the story of Godzilla and honestly was rather bored by the constant teasing of the monster for the first two acts. When Godzilla finally does fully appear at the last act I snuggled down into my seat ready for some awesome monster on monster battling. But instead of focusing on the monsters, it focused on the things that the lead character was doing around them. This was definitely the most aggravating thing about the movieas soon as the monsters really started throwing punches the camera would cut away. At one point there seemed to finally be an awesome showdownGodzilla and one of the monsters were running toward each otherGodzilla was about to monster punch it in the face when it CUT TO THE MAIN CHARACTER RUNNING ON THE SIDE WALK. As soon as that happened the whole theater let out a groan, a few jears, and several ""C'mon man!""'s. The ending is just your average action movie endingpredictable and not really interesting at all. <br/><br/>5. Final Evaluation 5/10<br/><br/>This movie will definitely make some people happy I'm sure. But it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, so I would suggest just stick with Pacific Rim and don't waste your money."

","First off, I went into seeing this being a fan of the ultra-campy Japanese Godzilla films. I don't really know what I expected from this new movie. What I found, however, was extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>There were plot holes bigger than Godzilla himself, who, by the by, has a minuscule amount of screen-time and is presented as almost a good-natured ""hero"". Furthermore, they kill off the only two characters with any shred of substance within the first-half hour. The other leads are pretty faces with no personality. The effects weren't nearly as good as I anticipated-and I'm sure rubber-suiting it would have been an alternative that would have made me considerably happier.<br/><br/>The only nods to the original film and its Japanese folklore roots are blink-and-you-miss-it. There's flash of the word ""Mothra"" (which I hoped meant that Mothra would be Gozilla's foe in the film, but alas, no.). Then there's Ken Wantanabe muttering ""Gojira"" with a painfully worried look on his face that does not change the entire film.<br/><br/>Adding further insult to injury, I FELL ASLEEP. I have never, ever, fallen asleep at a movie theater before. It was dark and chilly, the seats were comfy, and the movie was boring, so hey, who can blame me?<br/><br/>All in all, I found it to be a total waste of time and money. Hate on me all you choose."

I actually wanted to leave the theater a little before one hour.<br/><br/>Well, the death of the Breaking Bad guy was the moment from where on the movie was terrible.

","**Spoilers Ahead**<br/><br/>Being a monster movie newbie, I did fully know what to expect with the new adaptation of Godzilla. Judging by the previews, I predicted possibly an ""end of the world"" time film where the movie's hero would somehow find a way to defeat said monster villain before the world was destroyed. I was in for a shock. When the movie began I had high hopes; a very moving scene came within the first 15 minutes or so, and I was sure I was in for an enjoyable experience. Boy was I ever wrong! I don't fancy myself a cinematic genius, but I believe I have seen enough movies to tell when one is a complete flop. ""Flop"" is not accurate enough to describe the utter debacle that is ""Godzilla."" The only actor in the film that actually had any depth of character was killed off in the first hour of the movie and we were left with the character ""Ford"" to walk us through the rest of this over-wrought adventure. Side note-- it took me at least an hour to figure out Ford's name was in fact Ford. Could this be for the sheer ridiculousness of the name or the fact that I was fighting a nap in the movie... I cannot tell. In these types of movies, I believe the goal is for the audience to care about the characters we are watching; cheer for them-- want them to survive. I'm sad to say, but these characters inspired none of that. The acting and characters-- however bad they were-- was not the worst part of the film. My biggest gripe would have to be that the main character did almost nothing to advance the plot; and even worse -- the monster just sort of seemed to follow our ""hero"" around. Ford has a layover in Hawaii? Monster sighting! Ford is headed to Vegas? That's just where monster number 2 happens to be! Ford's family lives in San Francisco? One guess on where the big culminating battle will take place! I think if Ford would have decided to take a day trip to Disneyland, Godzilla & Co. would have been right there ready to destroy Space Mountain. In the movies (slight) defense, Godzilla looked pretty epic and .. yeah, that's all I have in the pro category.<br/><br/>I hate to be negative Nancy, but this movie was bad. Seriously awful. Not the worst I've ever seen, but the worst I've seen this year. The scariest part about this film is that Godzilla lived and the studio may try to make a sequel.<br/><br/>I give it a 3/10 only for the well done CGI and my own (admitted) ignorance of the monster movie genre."

","I saw this in a theater in 2D and found it enjoyable. 3D should make it better, a little (if you like this sort of thing; otherwise, stay away). Has everything a proper Godzilla movie should have. Yet another origin myth is provided, but it isn't too bad and does not take too much time to explain. The actor in charge of this does a nice job and this little bit of exposition ended with applause from the audience. The rest of the exposition is gotten out of the way so fast it is almost comic. No problem. A kid wearing a red baseball cap has a ringside seat for some of the giant monster battle. Most of the Godzilla movie homage is not so obvious, unless you count the entire plot. Massive destructive action is exciting and dramatic but not too harsh. Most kids don't give a darn when people are getting killed in a movie unless they don't realize it is only a movie, so let them know. Humans are portrayed as noble and heroic and doing the best they can in a difficult situation. Some of the human elements of the plot kind of threw me like they did not make sense and it goes by pretty quick. Repeated viewing should not hurt this movie much. Worth seeing once."
"filmfan1991","Null","2","6","22 May 2014"," Solid reboot for one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time
","I just recently got out of the movie theaters seeing ""Godzilla"" and for the most part, I thought it was good. It managed to bring another dead franchise back to life after the 1998 ""Godzilla"" supposedly killed it.<br/><br/>Its got great action and really detailed special effects (the ones we expect from high budget CG movies nowadays) on the monsters especially Godzilla himself even though his screen time is limited and overshadowed by the human characters in the film and the main monster villains: the MUTOs . But when he does appear on screen, the whole thing becomes really intense and heart pounding. The way that everything is shot builds up the suspense to reveal the monsters much like ""Jaws"" did in 1975 and Gareth Edwards understands this.<br/><br/>The movie has some nice touches that pay homage to the original 1954 classic. One of the characters is named Serizawa after the original one who played an important role in the original film. Godzilla is portrayed as a destructive force of nature although he becomes ambiguously heroic by the end of the film. The tone is very dark much like the original film with very little camp. <br/><br/>The cast is okay; Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a good performance as the main protagonist but his character is bland compared with Bryan Cranston who plays his dad(who unfortunately is killed off not even halfway through the movie). Ken Watanabe adds a nice touch as Dr. Serizawa and he's always great in a lot of the roles he plays.<br/><br/>""Godzilla"" is a solid franchise reboot that modernizes one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time for newer audiences. It has its problems but the good outweighs the negative and it manages to be an entertaining monster flick."
"jacobclark512","6","2","6","22 May 2014"," Fun to Watch, Even with the Flat Characters and Plot
","Have you ever expected something totally different than what you got when seeing a movie? I have on several occasions, the most recent being Godzilla. The first trailer I saw for it was very involving and well- done and made me want to see the film until I saw the title. I know next to nothing about the legendary monster and was not very eager to learn anything about him either. However, after noting the goals for the tone and feel of the film, I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>I could not have been more surprised with what I got. I expected the military to be hunting Godzilla, trying to destroy him before he destroyed the entire eastern seaboard. Instead the plot almost acknowledges Godzilla with the reverence of a god. Ken Watanabe's character, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, has been searching for him for quite some time and constantly urges the military to let Godzilla be the hero (spoiler: they do) and kill the two MUTOs, or massive unidentified terrestrial organisms, that have been terrorizing various cities in their search for radioactive material to feed on. He also believes that Godzilla is a balancing force of nature, not a destroyer. This is shown when he is on his way to San Francisco to confront the MUTOs. The military practically escorts Godzilla in an effort to control him; in return he never attempts to antagonize the military and always tries to not take human life. This antihero presentation of the monster is in stark contrast to the little knowledge I had of him; however, I greatly prefer this story treatment to the classic man versus monster plot. It allows for some epic monster versus monster battle scenes that destroy most of Honolulu and San Francisco that allow the audience to almost sympathize with Godzilla.<br/><br/>However, the story does fit many of the stereotypical characteristics of monster movies, particularly in the characters. Nearly all of the characters and their respective actions are two-dimensional and incredibly predictable, with only two notable exceptions. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, who has been previously discussed, is one exception. Ken Watanabe's acting is appropriately mysterious and complex and is easily the standout performance of the film. The other exception is Bryan Cranston's performance as Joe Brody, a nuclear physicist and conspiracy theorist. His suspicions about the incident at the nuclear power plant he managed are confirmed, and Cranston adds enough emotion and depth to make a standard character enjoyable. However, he is not in the film long enough to correct the poor acting of the rest of the cast. Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, in particular, are far too flat to be enjoyable. The fact that they are the two predominant actors on screen does not help their mediocrity at all. The story shares these same sentiments on the whole, remaining slightly interesting while never really jumping out as anything more than mediocre. <br/><br/>The visual effects are, as expected, the best seen in any Godzilla film thus far. The monster himself seems akin to the original Toho version in design rather than Roland Emmerich's version from the late 1990s bomb. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the various scenes showing how large Godzilla really is, particularly while the military is monitoring him on the ocean. He is massive and quite impressive to view. The MUTOs are very original and resemble something out of Jurassic Park. Overall, the creatures are very intricate in design and fun to watch, even if they do tear down most of downtown San Francisco. The rest of the film's visual appeal is high and retains a realistic and serious tone throughout. It differs from the original Toho films almost as much as Batman Begins differs from the 1960s Batman TV series, adding a heaping of grit and really helping the story along. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed Godzilla. Though it feels extremely flat in the story and character departments, the new take on the legendary monster and the impressive visual effects make him come roaring back to life. This film is definitely not all it could be, but it feels exactly like what it should be. A couple story flaws don't completely tear it down and set the stage for a future franchise. I just hope that it does not turn into the monster versus military conflict that so often occurs in the older Toho films."
"s195121","8","2","6","22 May 2014"," Godzilla is the king of the monsters
","My judgment is 8, a vote that I think to be very high. But it isn't a 8 of those you leave the cinema and run for the streets screaming masterpiece. It' a thoughtful 8.<br/><br/>The movie worth this high vote for different reasons.<br/><br/>The photography. Edwards continues to demonstrate, after Monsters, that he has an excellent eye. Firtst appearance of Godzilla is a bomb. Images that escapes, details of parts of the body, all seen in a human perspective, that is the normal way to make this kind of movie, and all involves, linearly, in some static total shots of many seconds, with an incredible calm for a monster movies, in which are shown the monsters to fight. As it was the reality. With attention to the details and one of the most incredible CGI of ever. ""400 calci"", one of the best Italian sites which speak about cinema, says that this is the future. I agree. The use of the music. Magic. The courage not to follow the the trend of the moment of the monster movies, giving to Godzilla a deserved drammatic atmosphere. The end. Godzilla doesn't die - maybe doesn't matter, but this made me happy, after the '98 Godzilla, in this one I was already resigned to see he die – but it's and end, not an open end. Yeah, there can be sequels, but you don't go home having that impression, like other movies in which you immediately understand that they have left space to another movie. The idea to put other monsters in the movie, cause humans are too small to impress Godzilla. Moreover, there are different scenes that are spectacular. The launch of the paratroopers from an absurd height, so video game style. The scenes in which Godzilla appears from the smoke, especially the one in which you see the blue light and only after you understand what is happening. The slam with the tail to kill the male muto. And the blue flame thrower straight into the guts of the female muto. And, more in general, all the fight scenes in San Francisco, are well done. I like to see skyscrapers go down like sand.<br/><br/>However, there are details that made me suffer to decide if I really liked the movie or not.<br/><br/>The ""human"" plot. It's true that have to be only a boundary, necessary to understand how much big is Godzilla compared to us humans but it works well until the appearance of the first muto, than decreases attractiveness. Characters are poorly characterized and highly stereotyped. They became unnecessary and pedantic to the story. Absurdly they were better characterized in the '98. I understand that the ""tone"" of the story is completely different this time, and I like it, but it was possible to work more to make less flat some character. The change of perspective, or even of scene, that there is more than one time during the fights, contribute to relate the human vision with the monster world, and, maybe, to make more dramatic the story, but I hated it. Godzilla isn't a film like Pacific Rim, okay, and also if I would have liked more fightings, I can understand the choice to make to put a few, but, damn, at least when they are fighting let me enjoy the show. The military ""butwhaat"". They are a lot, one for all. You have a train which is transporting a nuclear warhead. The only thing that you have to verify is that a monster big like a city and not so fast as to escape from your drones won't intercept the train. What's happen, obviously? True that in the action there are always some ""butwhaat"", but here they are really big, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>At the end, however, I appreciated the movie, and if I didn't go out from the cinema singing for joy, probably is because the dark and dramatic atmosphere worked well. Sincerely, I expected a typical American movie, with jokes and all the rest. It wasn't so. It was something more deep and less commercial. Probably, knowing the director, I would have expected something like that. It isn't a masterpiece, it could be better under different points of view, but has a reason for being. And deserves its 8. Pershaps."

I would've gone like: ""get the hell outta there, RIGHT NOW"".<br/><br/>Godzilla after taking a beating so severe, only then he unleashed his fire breath.<br/><br/>A creature that can fly, choose to meet his mate in California, instead of Nevada. Forcing his mate to walk on foot from Nevada to California.<br/><br/>Stupid script writer."
"thefilmguy7","6","2","6","21 May 2014"," ""Where is Godzilla?"" I was wondering the same thing Watanabe
","I was a bit unimpressed with the movie. They spent almost an hour totally devoted to setting up the Muto's. That entire time I just assumed that they were setting up Godzilla because why would you devote so much time to anything else that isn't Godzilla in a movie titled Godzilla? Then finally around the halfway point they introduce the title monster, except with much less build up and mystery as the Muto's. They rush through Godzilla's set up with a spoon fed exposition that lasts all but a few minutes in comparison to all of that time spent on the Muto's? Just baffling how misguided the focus was. Then finally we get these two misters to face off and ... oh wait ... instead we are going to cut away to some totally forgettable moment with what ever lame thing Aaron Johnson is doing. It's like having Superman versus Doomsday and instead of showing them fight, we watch Jimmy Olsen running to the roof of a building to get a good picture. True we finally get a pretty good fight at the very end but by that time, it's too little too late.<br/><br/>Passed these issues, of course there's the incredibly boring and one dimensional characters populating this world. Ken Watanabe appeared to be bored and counting the seconds until he could return to his trailer to sleep his entire performance. I wonder if the writers made it a game to think of ridiculous and convenient ways to include Aaron Johnson in every major scene of the movie. I spent the entire time wondering why the hell Elizabeth Olsen was involved at all. The only actor and character to bring any real weight to the movie was Bryan Cranston and he's definitely not as major of a player as the deceiving trailers would have you believe. Now I don't blame the cast for the lame characters. That blame clearly falls on the writing and direction.<br/><br/>There's good effects and a few cool action beats but over all this update felt very misguided. I understand wanting to withhold Godzilla to build the anticipation of his arrival but they mishandled that. Focusing on the Muto's as much as they did just made Godzilla feel less important. Having a balance would have worked but instead the scale was tipped way more towards the Muto's and Aaron Johnson in terms of focus. Godzilla was reduced to a few steps above being a cameo. The first act should have built up Godzilla and finished with his reveal, then have him be perceived as the main threat, only to realize that the real threat are the Muto's. Also Cranston should have been the main character as he easily would have carried the film. The way the film was handled, I just didn't feel much investment and I was bored in general."

","well here my review of Godzilla my 21st review my love of film never dies seeing how this they done this movie with the special effects laden movie I was going to see either X men or Godzilla I decided on Godzilla as the 3d looked amazingly done this is a film they should have done instead of Roland Emmerich movie his movie was good but this but disasters movies to shame the characters the first hour build up nicely the human story and the reason for Godzilla awaking up are well done the pacing is great in the movie the nod to the Japanese is great to keep it originality of the story~ Brian Cranston and Aaron Johnston do a good job as the hero of this film the fright scenes scare you as Godzilla is fighting his way around the pacific ocean the film feels like a play Station game call of duty in 3d you think you are join the fight to help save America from a disaster and make you want to join the marines army or navy great film totally different I cant give away the story to much because Godzilla is totally different and plot has a twist in a total opposite away that you would not expect I give it 9 out of ten for have a disaster movie for a change totally great by the way how would a sequel work I don't know. the director that done monster on 800000 budget brought tension and great story to that film .he brought his personality to this story of 160 million budget and he handles this direction well with haunting score and Godzilla and his enemies he doesn't like handles this film very well with loads of tension built up cities ruined its a great popcorn flick to watch for 2hrs highly recommended to all lovers of 3d disaster flicks on a truly epic scale"
"andyreynolds-1","7","2","6","21 May 2014"," Pretty Good
","The wonderful thing about taking a chance is sometimes you get lucky.<br/><br/>Thanks to the Godzillas franchises dubious history I didn't really expect much but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film makers supplied ample tension and (for sci-fi) a decent story to explain the huge monsters wandering around the pacific rim. The real genius was taking a leaf from Speilbergs ""Jaws"" and taking their time to reveal the real star of the film. Even the early battle scenes are intermittent and out of focus to tease and keep waiting for the ultimate confrontation in San Francisco.<br/><br/>If I have a complaint its with the portrayal by Ken Watanabe as he pursues Godzilla with the aid of the US Navy. Ken must be looking for a role in the next installment of a teen vampire/werewolf melodrama as he spends most of the time staring off into the distance. The rest of the actors play their part as capably as anyone asked to fill the gaps between rounds 1,2 & 3 of the heavyweight combatants. Brian Cranston more so than others.<br/><br/>This film is what the Godzilla movies of the 50's aspired to but as then special effects amounted to a bloke in a lizard suit traipsing around a collection of cardboard box skyscrapers with a smoke machine they were a bemusing Japanese fascination. Thanks to modern special effects those film makers could finally see their creation in all its glory.<br/><br/>It was a fun couple of hours (which as always could have been 15 minutes tighter) and worthwhile experiencing on the big screen."

","I want to start off by saying that I really underestimated this film, i thought it was going to be one wasted on crappy CGI with the boring old Godzilla story line where he tramples over the city, killing everything in his path blah blah. But this, i must say: was absolutely astonishing! From start to finish, great effects and brilliantly executed. Love the new twist in the plot as well with the clash between Godzilla and the two creatures. The first time you see Godzilla's face, you can't help but smile that cheeky grin of sheer awesomeness! I don't want to make this long, so i'm just going to say my favourite thing about the whole film... The ending - the fight scene between Godzilla and the two creatures. Watching Godzilla chokeslam one, get stabbed, smack it into the highrise with its tail breathe fire into the male's head and RIP IT OFF! Have a building land on it then come back to kill the mother creature at the end! Got to be the most action-packed, eventful, exciting ending i have ever seen to a film, GREAT FILM!"

","After 2 years of waiting and a huge amount of trailers and commercials, Godzilla 2014 is finally here, but is it worth seeing? I'm very happy to say that this movie more than delivers as a Godzilla movie and it is a great movie in general.<br/><br/>Let me get this out of the way, this movie looks gorgeous. Gareth Edwards really nailed the visual spectacles and managed to show Godzilla in a way audiences have never seen before, providing plenty of amazing scenes of scenery, destruction, and monster action to keep you satisfied. Godzilla and the MUTO monsters look amazing and steal the show in every scene they're in, and the destruction level is cranked up to the max as one would want from a Godzilla movie.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of Godzilla movies, this one actually gives you human characters you care about. Brian Cranston gives a great performance in his role, but he isn't in the movie as much as you might expect, which could be a little disappointing, but Aron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen also give good performances and do a good job at carrying the human element of the film. Most of the supporting cast do a good job as well, but some of them are almost wasted and don't have much to do, but this is only a minor flaw in the film.<br/><br/>Of course the main reason people would see this movie is because of the big G himself. Godzilla was handled with great taste. He has all of his trademarks, from his atomic breath to his incredible toughness to handle anything, and his roar sounds amazing, especially in the theater with surround sound. This might possibly be the best he's ever looked and sounded. The MUTO monsters are also cool looking and provide good monster villains and great opponents for Godzilla.<br/><br/>With this movie, it seems like they did it in the style of the first Godzilla film with a slow build up to Godzilla's reveal, which is done well and has a great pay off, I never felt cheated, but I feel at some points they cut away from the monster action too soon when it could have gone longer, but this is only applying to 2 or 3 moments in the film and again is only a minor flaw. Don't worry. Godzilla and the MUTOs have a pretty good amount of screen time, which is enough to satisfy audiences. <br/><br/>Godzilla 2014 is one heck of a ride and a much welcome return to the King of the Monsters. It's a great movie in general. Whether you're a fan of Godzilla or not, go see it. You will enjoy it."
"NCHaskew","9","2","6","19 May 2014"," King of the Monster Movies
","Let me just start out by saying my taste in movies, since my mindset may be drastically different from people interested in this movie. I'll just say, I love the old Godzilla movies. They were silly, cheesy, and a lot of fun, yet they still were able to add weight and a strong connection at the end of the day. At the same time, I really appreciate the art of film-making and story-telling in general. I love movies like Memento, Pulp Fiction, and the like. A film that shows the maker's genuine interest in the subject and the process of creating. That being said, I absolutely loved this film. It is true, like many people said, this movie is a bit slow, with Godzilla not making an appearance until about halfway through. So if you were wanting a film that is constantly strutting him in all his monstery glory, I would say you may not enjoy that film (though I would recommend Godzilla: Final Wars, if that's what you're looking for.) <br/><br/>So, what does a Godzilla movie focus on, if not Godzilla? Well, the people surrounding him of course--characters we can actually connect to. This movie is superbly cast with Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. And in that first hour, you truly grow to bond with these characters. You like them, and you feel their fear, and sincerely hope that all turns out well in the end. Which really helps to set the stage when we get to Godzilla's appearance. After establishing the world, the threat (two ancient leviathans awakened by radiation to wreak havoc), we have Godzilla emerging to confront them. And his emergence is absolutely biblical. His very appearance onto land creates a tsunami, and when he roars, you can feel Ken Watanabe's words, describing him as a god, nature's power personified. When you hear that war, you can feel the past, present, and future of Godzilla's awesome might. <br/><br/>What makes this monster movie so spectacular is how the film-makers let the creatures speak for themselves. It doesn't jerk itself off, showing characters constantly running in terror or standing awe-struck for minutes on end. Which is not to say they don't show fear or awe, but they take the time to regain their composure and focus on their missions. One of the greatest moments is when Elizabeth Olsen, portraying a soldier's wife, finally breaks down and confesses her fear to her husband, after standing as a rock for most of the movie, showing her son how to be brave. It moved me to tears. These characters are smart, strong, and determined. They face an insurmountable challenge, and they find solace in each other. I won't go into details on the story, but once it comes to that third act, that climax with Godzilla facing his opponents and the humans striving for survival, you will be on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a bunch of monster-fighting and lots of explosions, this isn't the movie for you. All of that stuff is there, but not as much as you would expect in a monster movie. I would stick with Pacific Rim and the like, if that's your fancy. But if you want good story, great performances, mind-blowing effects, and a atmosphere so tense it's nearly tangible, then head straight for the theaters while Godzilla is still around."
"kevinxirau","8","2","6","18 May 2014"," All hail the return of the King!
","Next to King Kong, Godzilla is arguably the most iconic monster of all time, spawning entire generations of kaiju films from Mothra to Rodan. My history (and love) with this franchise dates all the way back to my childhood, becoming something of a passion, and since I have grown I have come to appreciate what Godzilla and his fellow kaiju stood for, as forces of nature meant to remind humans that we are not as superior a species as we like to think of ourselves. At the same time, the kaiju themselves have demonstrated what it means to be human, showing emotions and character not typically seen in general American monsters. In 1998, Roland Emmerich failed miserably at his attempt to make his creature Zilla pass as the King of the Monsters. For sixteen years we have had to live with this outrage, but now newcomer director Gareth Edwards takes center stage with his re-imagining of Godzilla. It was worth the wait! <br/><br/>Plot: In 1999, nuclear physicist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) saw the death of his wife due to a strange tremor in the nuclear plant they worked in. Fifteen years later, Joe realizes that this was no natural disaster and goes looking for answers. He and his distant son Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) soon discover that man's arrogance has unleashed ancient, malevolent beasts called Mutos just as it had decades ago. With everyone's lives at stake, including Ford's wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), the military attempts to contain and eliminate the threat, but Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) believes only one thing can stop the malevolent Mutos, something just as ancient and equally terrifying. Nature has a power to restore balance and that power is in the form of the giant reptilian monster known as Godzilla. But, is Godzilla a friend or foe to humanity? Who will survive in the war of the monsters? <br/><br/>Since ""Godzilla 2000"", I have waited fourteen years to see another Godzilla movie in the theatres and my wish was granted, fan-boy joy and all. Gareth Edwards made sure not only to deliver great kaiju action and special effects, but also a well-written story with compelling human characters and good themes just as the original film ""Gojira"" had done.<br/><br/>The human element of this reboot is exceptionally well-done, with notable performances done by Bryan Cranston brilliantly delivering the tragic nature Joe Brody and Ken Watanabe bringing the insightful wisdom of Dr. Serizawa (a fitting reinterpretation of the original character). Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen do alright in their parts as a married couple trying to pull through in helping others at a time of crisis. A few other characters play there parts well enough at different points of the story. I like how some of the humans don't just sit by and do nothing, they really do their best to play their part, particularly Ford Brody.<br/><br/>There's some darn good kaiju here as well. Godzilla is presented as he should be, like an angry god who will stop at nothing until his enemies are destroyed and balance restored. There was a great deal of build-up to his grand reveal and when he shows up, it's all worth it. His design was awesome, sticking close to the classic look but updating it for today's standards (take note of this, Emmerich!). Some may question a few design choices here and there, but when one thinks about it they all make biological sense, bringing some realism to a gigantic radioactive dinosaur. Big G's roar was a nice sound effect, loud and pretty scary. Granted, Godzilla should have had more screen-time in the film, but I was at least satisfied. In the other corner, we have the Mutos, who are great additions to Godzilla's rogues gallery. They have a unique design that makes them look quite alien but still having traits that make them seem like real-life animals. Both kaiju are terrifying monsters, but Gareth Edwards made sure that they all have a sense of emotion and character, to which he succeeds, making us fear them but also empathize with them.<br/><br/>There are other elements that also make this film great. The suspense in the first half of the film is done almost perfectly, leaving you in anticipation for the arrival of the kaiju and the action in the second half. The music befits the dark tone of the movie, especially the surprisingly-catchy main theme which has a truly foreboding mood. The action scenes are excellent, shot with superb cinematography giving the sense of scale (important for creatures as big as these) and bringing increasingly great thrills. The battles between Godzilla and the Mutos are especially awesome to watch, smashing everything in their path as they brutally tear each other apart like savage animals. All of this is achieved with special effects that would impress even the greatest of filmmakers.<br/><br/>With a stellar cast, impressive special effects, spectacular kaiju, ominous music, impressive action scenes, and a few nice themes, Gareth Edwards has created an American reboot that is worthy of the license. Godzilla's creator, Tomoyuki Tanaka, would be so proud. Pacific Rim may have brought back people's interest in the genre, but Godzilla has officially cemented the fact that giant monsters are making a comeback (heck, Gamera is said to be coming back next year). It is SO GREAT to see the King of the Monsters grace the big screen once again and I look forward to seeing him in more. Sure, this movie does have a few flaws, but I would strongly recommend you check this action out."

I really, really did.<br/><br/>Most times I come here and read these reviews and think people are insane but, to be honest, I guess I'll just have to be one of ""those people"" this time.<br/><br/>I left the theater with a LOT of questions. There were things I just flat out didn't understand. I really didn't connect with the characters as well as I wanted to, because the chemistry just wasn't there. Also, why didn't we get more Godzilla? The huge fight scene at the end was amazing, yes, but the first two fights in the movie that could have been awesome were over WAY too fast. I was really bummed about that.<br/><br/>Also, I felt there were a couple of really cheesy moments in the movie. Most times I don't care about those but....just the way he announces that they named the beast ""Godzilla"".....with that long pause.....there were tons of people laughing in the theater at how silly that was. I actually felt embarrassed for the film. I never hear people laugh at something was supposed to me a more serious part of the film.<br/><br/>To be honest, there was quite a bit of laughing. :\<br/><br/>I am glad that I went to see it because it WAS enjoyable, but sadly as much as people hate it, I enjoyed the Godzilla with Matthew Broderick much more."

","Everything about the trailer were so misleading. I am sure that they cast Bryan Cranston just so they can mislead you in the trailer that he is going to be a big part of the movie. His character died 20 mins in the movie. Same can be said about Godzilla himself his screen time is also about 20 mins and 10 mins of it is his back and feet teasing you. The rest of the movie is a compilation of mediocre acting and character decision that make you want to tear your hair out of its root. ""Oh the monster absorb radiation as a source of power you say, lets bomb them with a bomb full of radiation."" <br/><br/>Here is the movie outline: 1.

One of the only things that niggled me was near the end when Ford Brody is on the bought with the bomb going out to see, there's 5 minutes left on the bought, just out of San Francisco barely, he passes out, gets picked up by a chopper and out of there, and somehow the boat gets the 20 or so miles away it needs to be for a safe detonation distance?

It also must be said that the CGI in this film is astonishing and there are definitely frames which I would use as a desktop background.<br/><br/>I feel the cast in the film are decent and do the movie justice.

","""Awesome!"" was my reaction to the Godzilla (2014) trailer; unfortunately I couldn't say the same for the film it's self. Despite being well cast, the story was rather thin. The characters were not ones I became drawn to, which really just left a film that showcases special effects and action sequences. The actors did their best with an ordinary script and deserve credit for keeping the audiences in their seats. I've not seen Elizabeth Olsen in a film before, but was actually surprisingly impressed with the quality of her acting. The effects were exceptional, though 3D was not a great choice as most of the action scenes were quite dark visually. Ultimately, the amazing effects and good acting could not save a film with an unoriginal story that appears to be from a predictable Hollywood action template. In fact, I think the writer gave up on the story half way through.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Special effects: 9 / 10 Story: 3 / 10 Acting: 7 / 10"
"OllieSuave-007","6","2","6","17 May 2014"," They put part of the ""God"" back in ""zilla.""
","I have been a devoted Godzilla fan for years and have always been intrigued and entertained by the overall quality and fun (albeit sometimes campy) the original Japanese Godzilla film and its over-two-dozen sequels bring. They have a special charm to them and are definitely treasured classics. This second American version of the monster classic, I believe, somewhat does the monster justice but is better than the 1998 American version with Matthew Broderick.<br/><br/>The trailer gives people the impression that this is a very dark film where Godzilla begins a spree of terror in the U.S. and throughout the world. However, it is really about Godzilla and two other malevolent creatures called MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) being awaken and unleashed by the events of the nuclear bombing at Bikini Atoll in the 1940s. This leads to a battle between the monsters, with American cities caught in the middle.<br/><br/>The film starts off with some intrigue, showing scientists Joe and Sandra Brody (Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche) getting caught in an accident at the Janjira Nuclear Plant near Tokyo, where an explosion and radiation leak lead to causalities, already giving the audience the impression that monsters are involved, since radiation is a trademark element in bringing Godzilla to life. However, the movie drags on a bit after that when we are taken 15 years later after the incident, to a lot of uninteresting human drama involving the character leads. The movie picks up again almost toward the middle of the movie when we see some action involving the MUTOs, military and citizen evacuations - all leading to a pretty spectacular monster battle.<br/><br/>Writers Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham wrote a pretty interesting story. Director Gareth Edwards did a decent job directing the film, inserting enough drama, carnage, tension and thrills to make the film more believable and serious than the 1998 version. And, composer Alexandre Desplat wrote a very catchy and haunting music score, giving it a monster flavor and I thought the few first strands of his themes will remind you of Godzilla's classic theme from his original Japanese movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't blown away by the acting, which I found to be pretty awful - Cranston was mediocre and a little overzealous; British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody was bland, boring and emotionless with a bad American accent; Elizabeth Olsen as Elle Brody was OK; and Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ichiro Serizawa looked too confused. However, Serizawa did bring the connection between radiation and the monsters, and seemed to be one of a very few in the movie who has sympathy for them (echoing elements from the original Japanese series). Therefore, I felt Serizawa contributed the most to the plot. <br/><br/>Lastly, the visual and special effects were pretty awesome. I'm not a big fan of CGI, however, the effects team did capture the somberness and carnage of fallen cities, and the mayhem and terror of the monsters' presence.<br/><br/>Although Godzilla himself is given limited screen time, the monster is the real star of the movie as the drama and talks concentrate on him and his presence is felt throughout the movie. It's a pretty good way to celebrate Godzilla's 60th anniversary and, as the audience in the theater was left applauding after the credits started to role, this is actually a pretty satisfying film that somewhat puts the ""God"" back in ""zilla."" I just wished that there was more monster action and wished the acting was better; I wouldn't mind if the producers had selected an entire new crop of actors over the ones employed.<br/><br/>Grade C+"

","First off when you go in you have to understand that Godzilla has not graced our presence for sixteen years. You have to understand that they have to tell a story to the new generation and upcoming Godzilla fans. When I left the theater I did feel a little dis-appointed, but the more I thought about it the more the plot and screen time of our favorite giant lizard made sense. The movie has to have a good foundation to build off of for hopefully a sequel and new fans to the franchise. The first part was great in my opinion a very nice steady build up, almost an urgency to what we have been anticipating for a while now. I liked the pace and the acting was great. The second act was kind of slow, but the build was worth the wait when Godzilla finally makes his appearance, I was leaning on the edge of my seat staring at awe at the masterpiece of Godzilla, his presence was anything but non-effective. In my opinion the CGI on Godzilla and the MUTOs were spectacular, the pure wake of disaster was what I expected.<br/><br/>The characters to me were okay but not enough to inflict emotion, just out of reach of really caring what happened to them but yet still interested in the outcome. I don't expect a masterpiece of a love story in a Godzilla movie but if you are going to put it in, you need to be able to sell it. As a long time fan I would have been fine with two hours of monster to monster fighting, but I understand the reasoning.<br/><br/>The last half was by far my favorite of the entire movie, you get great action scenes and of course the last ten minutes are of epic proportions. I say this as I took a fellow non-fan and they thought it ""pretty f'ing epic"", words of theirs not mine.<br/><br/>All I can say is give it a chance and go see it, very great look and my hat is off to Edwards, I think he did a splendid job at giving our favorite lizard a great debut in this reboot."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","6","17 May 2014"," A giant improvement on the last outing
","Clearly one cannot keep down a monster the size of Godzilla (the name is a combination of two Japanese words meaning 'gorilla' and 'whale'). Since his first appearance in a Japanese movie in 1954, there have been no less than 28 offerings from Toho Studios, while there have now been four American productions: two (1956 and 1985) re-packagings of a Japanese film, the ill-fated 1998 version (which was supposed to have been the first of a trilogy), and now this Legendary/Warner Brothers outing.<br/><br/>Let it be said immediately that British director Gareth Edwards has produced a superior film to the mess than we had in 1998 - a well-paced and entertaining thriller. He is helped by advances in technology (the end credits name a vast army of special effects artists) and the co-operation of the US military (the same end credits acknowledge the use of an arsenal of ships and weaponry), but also we have a vaguely understandable plot this time, as San Franscisco rather than New York City is pummelled into the ground. Godzilla looks the part (congratulations to the casting director), but the two MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) look as if they were rejects from the 1997 movie ""Starship Troopers"".<br/><br/>As two of those in charge of the monster hunt, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn fit their roles well; and, as a romantic couple in peril, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are pretty enough; but Sally Hawkins is miscast for a blockbuster movie (and I mean that as a compliment) and there is a criminal under use of the wonderful French actress Juliette Binoche (as with Jean Reno in the 1998 film, it seems that the producers just wanted to pull in a Gallic audience).

This is coming from a guy who finds that cgi leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Godzilla itself resembles the beast that we can remember from yesteryear, thankfully!<br/><br/>As far as acting and character development goes, well there just isn't any. Cranston delivers a fine performance, though his appearance in the film is all to brief, and that frustrated me. The majority of the characters were painfully dull, and some... why are the even there??.. I don't know.<br/><br/>For a no brainer, visual extravaganza go and see it, there were fist pumps galore during the battles, and some clever little details to get you excited. Though don't go in feeling like you will be getting an insight into anything you don't already know about the beast.. it is ambiguous at best. I can smell a franchise coming, starring the worlds greatest anti hero."
"chubbalubbadingdong","7","2","6","16 May 2014"," I like it... But don't love it.
","I ended up in existential crisis after viewing this movie. To begin, I love Godzilla. I've been a fan since I was three and for seventeen years now I have amassed a collection of Godzilla VHS' and DVD's (well, as many as I can with the availability of them in the UK). I loved the Big-G, even films like 'Godzilla's Revenge'! I've spent a long time of my life devoted to this franchise, so I went into this movie expecting to love it. Yet I didn't... Why? Why don't I love this film? After a few stiff whiskys and talking to my mates who I saw it with at the cinema, I feel I can produce a fair review. <br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston: What a guy! I liked him in this movie, he portrays a tortured man well, unbalanced yet reserved when necessary. I felt for his Joe Brody character, he truly was the embodiment of Us vs Them, the man against the government, the good old conspiracy nut. <br/><br/>The MUTO's: A cross between, Gigan; Battra and the Cloverfield monster, these things where really frightening! From their strange; half metallic, whispering, creaking roars to their spindly arms attached to massive hulking mass these things where freaky! They fit well into the Godzilla universe and are a perfect edition to the team. <br/><br/>Godzilla: Well, the films about him! My jaw dropped every time he appeared or he was teased, the 8 year old me wailing in joy. The time he's on screen your eyes are drawn to him and him only. His features and traits are like that of a bear and human, his face rippling and nostrils flaring like the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, his eyes looking like a humans. It's quite an unsettling image but you feel emotions towards the big guy and I felt Gareth Edwards handled him well...<br/><br/>To an extent... <br/><br/>The Not so Good to Meh:<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston: Star Powers a blessing and a curse. The first half hour/forty minutes are great because Cranston is driving this thing. He's our main focus and Ford is along for the ride. Seeing as Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't that charismatic in his film, when Cranston bites it we're left with this bland pallet of necessary emoting when is needed to drive the plot along. <br/><br/>Ken Wantanabe: Was the whole point of his role to stand around looking thoughtful and confused in dark places and sprout philosophical nonsense and be the forced metaphor against nuclear power because, you know, he's Japanese? I wanted to like this character, but when haphazardly he forces his fathers watch out in the Col. face that's stopped at the exact point the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, we all cringed! It's so, forced and made to drill home a message. It didn't need that.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast for that matter: Everyones so bland and by the numbers. I can't really mention much about their performances because they where just standard. <br/><br/>The Monsters Handling: Big airport reveal! Cuts to black after Godzilla roars... Fight shown on TV in snippets Godzilla destroys GGB... literally disappears from the scene and turns up in the city for another short smack down. The films called Godzilla... The MUTO's do more than Godzilla in all senses. Godzilla is just there to sort stuff out for us then go back again.<br/><br/>The trailers spoilt all the buildups: I love the trailers for this movie, but if you told me a few months ago that these were some major points of buildup for scenes that didn't last that long or important scenes, I would have probably... still gone seen the movie because it's Godzilla! But still, being a blind fan boy can't help me not notice that so many shots of Godzilla that where used are part of the main actions sequences. I had seen these scene's so many times I knew what was coming and was excited, but then disappointed by the outcome. <br/><br/>And now for my biggest pet hate....<br/><br/>DUES EX MACHINA! My goodness Ford Brody's a lucky so-and-so isn't he? They said that the HALO jump would be a no return mission, just so happens that a helicopter picks him up before the nuke drops. The army happen to be moving towards San Fran and just happen to let Ford into their ranks because... Oooh-rah Marines? I don't really know the ins and outs of the military, but there's no mention of conscription and then Ford just kinda ends up where the action happens. <br/><br/>Now a lot of die-hard Godzilla fans are probably preparing their typing fingers to pull me apart; say I don't get it or say I'm not a true fan because I didn't like this movie. They'll probably blast me saying 'Oh, but Jurassic Park had 15 minutes total of dinosaur action!', 'What about Jaws?!"", 'Too many monsters fighting all the time would be boring!' As many people have pointed out on the boards, 'less is more' works because we see the creature DO something in full view or very well suggested shots. I wanted to see more Godzilla. The shot where they fight in the city in the rain, it started, then finished! Dragged out over the whole night inter cut with ATJ being boring and moody soldier. It felt like missing reel stuff or it had be cut shorter. <br/><br/>Overall, this wasn't the 1954 or even 1984 style remake/reboot I wanted.I enjoyed it, it gave me some thrills and enough action. But with everything flitting around at break neck speed and the action coming in sporadic splashes across the movie, it felt very muddled.<br/><br/>7 - 10"
"3xHCCH","7","2","6","15 May 2014"," Slow Burn to Explosion
","I know about Godzilla, but I am not by any means a die-hard fan of this Japanese nuclear monster. I did not even get to watch the much-maligned 1998 Hollywood Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick. But definitely the pulse-pounding and very intriguing trailer made really want to catch this present-day homage to the classic film monster.<br/><br/>From vintage-style scenes showing nuclear experiments in the 1950s, the story jumps to 1999 in the Philippines, where a big earthquake unearths evidence of a giant fossilized monster. Following this, another massive but unnatural tremor occurs in Japan causing the destruction of a nuclear facility where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) loses his wife and destroying the once good life he lived.<br/><br/>The story jumps 15 years to the future when Joe's son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) returns home after years his military service. An emergency call brings him back to Tokyo to help his dad who seemed to have never moved on since the tragedy of 1999. Unusual seismic activity similar to 1999 are happening again, but this time it unleashes three destructive monsters, two huge flying mantis-like creatures, and one gigantic dinosaur-like beast, whom they called Godzilla. They wreak havoc not only in Japan, but across the globe, reaching a climactic battle-royale in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is really a very sensitive actor. I know him because of his award-winning performances on the TV show ""Breaking Bad"", though I have not really watched that show beyond the first episode. He is the true human heart of this film. <br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson has really evolved from the nerdy pseudo-hero Kick- Ass to how he looks in this film. I did not recognize him. Oddly, he feels generic here, little star presence, giving a serviceable but ultimately forgettable lead performance. <br/><br/>Ken Watanabe is really the go-to Japanese lead actor. In this film he plays the Japanese scientist who was studying these monsters. Mr. Watanabe was very good in conveying distress with his intense face. However, I felt he sounded very garbled when he talked. I think I lost a lot of details because of his unclear pronunciation of words.<br/><br/>Technically, the sound was so massive. It reverberated through the whole theater causing us to shake. The computer-generated visual effects were similarly top-notch, especially the monsters and the destruction they were causing. We watched this in 3D which for me while nice to see, did not really add much to the enjoyment of the film. The film had a rather dark and muddy color palette, I believe the 3D made it even more murky-looking.<br/><br/>I felt the build up to the last hour when Godzilla was finally being revealed was very slow. It was only Bryan Cranston's presence that kept these scenes from being boring. The story-telling felt turgid, and repetitive. However, whenever the titular character Godzilla was on screen, up to his very last scene, it was truly awesome indeed. The final battle in San Francisco was epic and emotional, the best parts of the film as a whole, particularly that moment when he first unleashes his nuclear laser-like breath. <br/><br/>Director Gareth Edwards, in his desire to remain faithful to the story's Japanese roots, took a very slow burn approach indeed. But hang on, and the film culminates in one glorious explosion of action and heart toward the end."

"daniewhite-1","3","1","2","15 November 2019"," Muto's are boring
","'Godzilla' is mainly Muto's and their defining feature is boringnes. Even their sex lives. Graphic depictions of reproduction by gigantic, ancient, supernatural, monster, insects. Even that's boring. They can't carry this film. In part because their supposed capacity to be a parasite to Godzilla is oddly bypassed..... That's gotta be the real story angle with this set up surely!? But no. No. It isn't. Possibly designing them to resemble the beast from 20000 fathoms would have injected some non-boringness into them by being a kudus gaining reference for monster movie fans?! But no. No. They didn't.<br/><br/>As many people have said this film is structured as a slow burn story, mainly availing the audience of snippets of Godzilla until he is unleashed in the climactic engagement with the Muto's. Snippets eventually have skirmishes added to them until the big kaboom fight.<br/><br/>It's nice to know that the monsters in this film have read their fair share of film scripts. So that they know how to behave. Entirely the opposite of the monsters in the director Edwards' breakout film.<br/><br/>By contrast the madness and of the Japanese Godzilla is gone. Why make Godzilla films if they're not mad? It's the main crazy enjoyment that I get from them! Sometimes watching Japanese Godzilla films I'm not sure if I have any sense of any sense at all and that's utterly absent in this film. The film makes rigid sense.<br/><br/>Also Godzilla himself is surely a direct agent acting on humanity within Japanese film traditions: either as our enemy/destroyer/agent of judgement or as our odd/mad protector. From space alien giant robots and other denizens of ""Monster Island"" and such like.<br/><br/>Here Godzilla seems remote to humanity as a whole. Apart that is, from one American family possessed of truly prodigious ""right place right time"" capacity. It's good to see that they read film scripts too!<br/><br/>As another attempt to make an American version of a Godzilla film this is to my mind a failure.<br/><br/>For me the actual artistic design of Godzilla has some good in it and his smashing sky scrapers with impacts from his prone body is actually quite cool in it's solid way. The skydiving military sequence is a proper piece of blockbuster filmmaking in my opinion.<br/><br/>Therefore personally I rate this film 3/10; a notch above barely dismal level because one or two sequences of good visuals, one scene outstanding, are included."
"tvhost-44369","8","1","2","28 October 2019"," A great disaster flick
","One of the biggest reasons why I love ""Gojira"", amongst a bevy of other things, is that it felt like a disaster movie just as much as a monster movie. It's a style only the original possessed, until 2014 when Gareth Edwards got ahold of the product. That's why one of the main reasons Godzilla 2014 worked for me, it pays more tribute to the Original 1954 piece more than the others. It could have easily been a Pacific Rim-style beat em up, but it took the risk to not go with that style. (Instead it waited for ""King of the Monsters"" to do that) A G-fan may watch this movie and complain about the lack of action and more anthesis on the characters, and to that I say the original 1954 one had more anthesis on the characters too and, once again, this film is paying tribute to more of that then all the other ones where the action and entertainment is higher. When the monsters fight in this movie though, it is one of the best brawls of all time. It is extremely satisfying and that's why I don't mind the rest of the movie having slow buildup. This film is not only a good monster movie, it is also a great disaster flick."

"RhapsodyReviews","7","1","2","16 September 2019"," Entertaining; One-Dimensional Characters
","Review:
'Godzilla' is an American monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is a reboot of Toho's Godzilla franchise and is the first film in Legendary's MonsterVerse. Most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion, it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The action in this this movie is really well done, and they don't over do it with explosions or unnecessary violence, which is shocking.
In the film, a soldier (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) attempts to return to his family while caught in the crossfire of an ancient rivalry between Godzilla and two monsters known as MUTOs.
Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are all one-dimensional, and nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspiring dialogue. They can't create good chemistry between them either, because the only have two scenes together and are apart for the rest of the film. I didn't like that the story is still very Americanised in the fact that it is a very white cast even though the bulk of the film is in Japan.
Say what you will about the shake cam, or the fact that you don't see the God of Monsters that much. This film is balls to the wall entertaining as it should be being a Summer Blockbuster. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is kidding themselves.
Overall, this movie has a good story with very entertaining action scenes. The characters are unfortunately not fleshed out enough to care about what happens to them. The only character in the movie you are rooting for is Godzilla himself.
3.5/5"

"jackson_ro","5","1","2","15 June 2019"," Godzilla
","A pure and simple action thriller, Godzilla does not get into the nitty gritty science and lores, which in a sense is a tribute to the original Godzilla movies. The film is thrilling with some very memorable scenes involving Godzilla and the MUTOs. It's use of CGI and monster designs are on a scale that is fitting to the stature of Godzilla. However, the human element of the film really drags the entire movie down. The lines are too cheesy, characters aren't introduced properly nor do they have significant motive or character development, leaving me to wonder at times a whole lot of ""why"" and ""how"". From Bryan Cranston to Elizabeth Olsen, everyone feels a little awkward and forced in the film."
"cardsrock","6","1","2","6 June 2019"," Slow burn to a fault
","Gareth Edwards' version of Godzilla is known for taking the unique approach of waiting long into the movie until showing the titular monster and then showing very little of him the rest of the film. It's bold and different, but ultimately it doesn't result in an appealing showcase for the character we all want to see. I don't really care about the uninteresting human characters that take up most of the screen time, I want to see GODZILLA."

"putrescent_stench","7","1","2","17 February 2019"," Fun if Flawed Hollywood Take on the Japanese Icon
","Being a huge fan of Godzilla movies, I was highly anticipating the release of Gareth Edwards' 2014 American Legendary Films reimagining. I'd heard that Toho was involved more with the production, I thought Edwards' Monsters (2010) was an intriguing take on a giant monster movie, and Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame was in it, promising strong performances and drama to support the monster action. Leaning back in my theater chair with a tub of popcorn, a big smile on my face, and surrounded by friends, I was so ready for this to be amazing. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed, and a friend's constant complaining about every possible nitpick tarnished my experience even further. Forward to 2019, when I finally decided I wanted to revisit it, feeling hyped again for the sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, coming out in May this year. Got the Blu Ray to add to my growing Godzilla collection-I've got most of them, though there are so many! It's loaded with extras that I'll have to get to at some point before May.<br/><br/>My appreciation for it has slightly increased, and I think it's enjoyable as a ""dumb action/sci-fi movie,"" which is what most of the Godzilla films are, aside from the 1954 original and a few later gems like Godzilla vs. Mothra (1964) and Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant All-Out Monsters Attack (2001), which actually have good acting, human storylines, and capture some of the social heft of the original. So it's a bit unfair to judge this movie for what it isn't, though it's hard to judge the film on its own terms since it seemed like it was trying to meld suspenseful/fun creature rampage flick with a serious human survival/family action/melodrama story.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect is how the monsters are handled. Despite the short amount of screentime Godzilla gets, the restraint does build up anticipation for the reveals. And the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) do get shown off a lot destroying stuff early on. The first half hour does a solid job of setting up the threat, so we understand how dangerous they are when they start wreaking havoc. Their appearance is sinister and unique; describing them as ""insect-like"" is probably the easiest comparison. Godzilla thankfully looks akin to the original Toho designs, a lumbering, spiky giant rather than the sleek giant iguana of the 1999 Tri-Star incarnation. There's great carnage action of city destruction and monster fights with the MUTOs, and the news footage of the monsters' conflict played casually on television sets adds a bit of campy levity to an otherwise too-serious tone. Finally, there's that one scene of Godzilla using his radioactive beam in an ""oh yes!"" moment that every decent Godzilla movie has.<br/><br/>As for the mix of monster and human stories, the problem is that these elements are uneven, the human drama pushed to the forefront, focusing on Cranston's character, Joe Brodie (an engineer at a nuclear power plant) and later his son, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an army bomb disposal expert. This isn't inherently bad, as I thought it was what made Monsters unique, leaving me with the impression of a giant monster movie ""elevated"" to dramatic heights. What's unfulfilling is that it lacks emotional weight, suspense, or originality. We spend so much time with Ford yet learn little about or see little emotion from him (it's hard to decide whether this is due to Taylor-Johnson's limitations or the writing or a combination). And a soldier, we are meant to see him as a kind of military hero, and also as a loving family man, searching for his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and son (Carson Bolde). It's all a bit cliché.<br/><br/>The role of MONARCH, the secret government agency studying giant creatures, which also plays a role in Kong: Skull Island (2017) and will feature in the next installments in the Legendary ""Monsterverse,"" adds a bit of intrigue, with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) a clear nod to director Ishiro Honda (who helmed the original as well as several sequels) and the tragic Dr. Serizawa from the first film, and Dr. Vivenne Graham (Sally Hawkins, now famous as the protagonist of The Shape of Water). While neither have much to do during the film, they are strong actors who bring a presence and a gravitas to the situation-understanding that all they can really do is study the monsters, because the military is not equipped to defeat them.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch for even a casual kaiju (giant monster) fan, as long as you have tempered expectations. Despite its flaws, it's entertaining enough as a set up the Monsterverse and to see Hollywood put forward a more respectful take on Godzilla than the 1999 movie. While the Tri-Star Godzilla, I would argue, is actually not a bad giant monster movie, it fails miserably as a Godzilla movie, with few similarities to the Japanese franchise and the military winning the day. Legendary's take resembles the original series in that humans are struggling for survival rather than triumphing over creatures who are clearly beyond human power to control. Kong: Skull Island was more fun than this film in terms of campiness and more monster action, and the trailers for Godzilla: King of the Monsters look amazing, so I am exciting for the future of this franchise."

"JakeBrinkman","5","1","2","31 January 2019"," Not a monster-action movie, great as a monster thriller
","Godzilla was an excellent Godzilla movie that was marketed extremely poorly. Classic Godzilla films all have an hour or more of buildup and anticipation for the massive monster that is about to appear, followed by 30 minutes or less of epic monster battles.<br/><br/>Godzilla (2014) was able to capture that feel and anticipation perfectly, updated for the modern film industry, and should be remembered as one of the best Godzilla movies. However, the movie was marketed as if it were filled with scenes of either Cranston or Godzilla, both of whom are actually in the movie for 20 minutes or less. That coupled with the fact that everyone was still high on Pacific Rim served to be a disaster for Godzilla (2014) because the majority of the audience was expecting to see an extremely different type of movie.<br/><br/>With that said, the acting was unremarkable and the classic style of Godzilla films can seem boring for modern audiences or out of place beside modern films."

The build-up and anticipation in this film is some of the best I have ever seen in any movie ever, period. The cinematography is extremely good, particularly when the camera is being shown from the humans perspective, as this shows just how huge the monsters really are. Bryan Cranston in this movie is fantastic, too bad he's only in it for the first 40 minutes. And the final battle between Godzilla and the M.U.T.O's brought back fond childhood memories.<br/><br/>In short, if you are going into this movie expecting a typical monster movie where the monster destroys everything for the entirety of the movie, expect to be disappointed. However, if, like me, you love movies that create a great sense of anticipation and world building, you'll love this movie, regardless of whether you are a Godzilla fan or not."
"timmybalga85","8","1","2","4 April 2017"," Very Solid Godzilla Movie
","I appreciated this movie greatly mostly for the fact that it follows more along the lines of the 1954 classic. It's a much darker Godzilla story then what has been shown in the previous 1960-1990's Godzilla movies. I will agree that Godzilla was shown for not much time and they definitely should have found a way for him to come in earlier. There were also a few scenes that didn't happen that definitely should have happened. I think we all know what scenes they are *cough cough* airport *cough*. There were some things I was disappointed in, but it did so much right for Godzilla. Every bit of Godzilla you see in this movie is the real Godzilla. He is back and ready as ever to kick monster ass. He is NOTHING like 1998's travesty of a monster. The MUTO's were also very well designed and interesting monsters. The fight scenes are excellent and well choreographed. Overall I thought it was a great Godzilla movie with a lot of homage to the original 1954 Gojira. It was also a great way to set up the monster universe. I'm very excited for the upcoming movies and really hope that they don't pull a lot of these mistakes a second time. It works effectively this time, but a second movie like this would kill it."

Most of it was filmed in the dark using extreme close ups so there was NO idea of what the hell was going on. A train comes out of the silent dark in flames. How? Why? The beasts are battling. Now they're not. They're over here. Now they're over there. What the F##*? No narrative to help the viewer either. It was like trying to watch the film in the dark through a keyhole. Absolutely frustrating. Pure crap. The review requires 10 lines of text in order to be accepted. But ten lines is more than this movie deserves and certainly more than is needed to express how dreadfully boring and annoying it is. I'd rather watch any movie where you can actually see what's going on instead of some blurred dark images that passes for art in the mind of some self-centerd filmmaker."

","I'm always wary when 5 to 10 minutes into a film, the screen goes almost black, however, I thought I'd watch this film regardless of the bad reviews as I like a good monster flick and haven't seen one since the Japanese 'The Host' It would've been OK if it hadn't have been so dark. Why they cant set them during the day is beyond me. The Host was in daylight all the way through and never once did it spoil the atmosphere, in fact it did exactly the opposite. When are these film people gonna learn, folk are bored with peering at a gloomy screen for 2 hours. One of the best TV series ever, 'Breaking Bad' hardly had a dark scene in it so come on movie people, get your act together, any more DARK films and I'm out of there or if its on the TV it will be switched off."

","Lots of noise no pay off. The story had promise, but it was disjointed and boring. The director substituted noise for action and his the creatures in dark disjointed scenes. To be honest the bad Godzilla movie starring Matthew Broderick was better than this poor attempt. They give you this rehashed footage at the start of the atop nuclear test that we see in all these movies. The movie introduces characters only to have them disappear from the story. The main human character is never made likable. And Godzilla is reduced to some overgrown dinosaur. We see his weak breath weapon have no effect on the bad creature. And the story jumps location so fast you have to believe the army has faster than light travel abilities. In a couple hours you go from Japan tho Hawaii to Las Vagas to San Francisco. Total waste of a great monster."

Also, it was a typical hero celebration with a tearful reunion at the end which, of course, had to be carried through the whole film with dialogue setups.<br/><br/>You just have to wonder why go to the trouble . ."

","My hubby and I like watching old Godzilla movies -- the cheese is just wonderful and the monsters so silly. I can't say whether or not this movie is very cheesy or the monsters silly because at least half the movie is in darkness! What few glimpses of the monsters we had seemed in line with the old films, silly and huge. The attempt to make an interesting human story underneath the entire monster fight scenes felt contrived; the humans could have been removed from the movie and it would have only made a shorter film. The acting wasn't bad but it was pointless because in all honesty, there isn't anything a mere human or human military could do against such creatures if they aren't making a personal connection with them. I have never checked my clock as often with any other Godzilla movie. Bored out of our minds."

","This is not a good movie.<br/><br/>I wanted it to be, too. It has Bryan Cranston in it! But he doesn't have enough screen time to make a difference. (1) (Big spoilers are footnoted)<br/><br/>After sixty years, the scientific level of the original Godzilla movie has not improved - it has deteriorated. (2)<br/><br/>Having designed several giant monsters of unprecedented size, the producer has decided to have them always fight in the middle of the night so nobody can see what is actually happening. (3)<br/><br/>It has every monster movie cliché ever, including:<br/><br/><ul><li>The family whose members are always at ground zero wherever and whenever the monsters show up, even if the monsters have to cross the Pacific to track them down.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>People who try to outrun not only blast waves, but also the gamma rays emanating from the material in the blast waves.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Generals who make the worst decisions ever (4), overruling Japanese men with mystical wisdom.</li></ul><br/><br/>You might think they are just doing these things as ""hommage"" to the quirks of the lovable low-budget films of sixty years ago. That's not what comes across. Then of course there is the huge death toll, which is not so fun to watch as you might think.<br/><br/>The effect of all this is to make the whole thing just a tedious business. I watched the whole thing on PPV mainly out of a sense of stubbornness, because I had not only paid money for it but struggled through a host of network problems to make it play. Wife: ""Is it over?"" Me: ""No. Thirty-five minutes left.""

But they might use electromagnetic pulses against you. So you attach the bomb to a (spring-wound??) clockwork timer that will set it off in an hour and a half. What can go wrong? Other that the monster has plenty of time either to eat the bomb or even steal it and carry it into the middle of the populated city so you have to send a suicide team to disconnect the detonator again."

","OK, let me begin, this is by far one of the stupidest movies I've seen in years; even some of the poorly made b-movies I've seen in the intervening time are more interesting.<br/><br/>While I try to watch this movie because I'm a fan of Godzilla, this is just a joke, the so called ""king"" of the monsters gets less screen time than average ad break on television - instead we focus on a bunch of pointless characters running around trying to figure out what Godzilla and those creepy Pokémon hybrid things are doing, while Godzilla is supposedly the 'saviour' of humanity he fails horribly only defeating the hybrids by mere luck.<br/><br/>While the hybrid things seem less concerned with Godzilla or humanity and more concerned with finding nuclear material to rub up against so they can reproduce, the idea that these things are from an ancient time when the earth was a dozen times more radioactive barely fills the plot hole of how they survived in eons past, the problem is the earth has never been that radioactive at any point in it's geological history.<br/><br/>It simply serves to make the Americans and Japanese look like complete idiots, it makes the 1998 American reboot a pleasure to watch as well - it worries me that whoever commissioned this 'thing' to be produced wants to make a trilogy of it. (Who knows, at least it might drive them to bankruptcy so they can never create such an abomination again...)<br/><br/>As a final note, this is one of the only movies I have ever been so disgusted with that I have actually tossed it into the trash, mainly to save space and so I won't be watching it, ever again..."
"UsernameHype","7","1","2","28 July 2015"," This is the Godzilla movie we should have gotten in 1998
","Though this is in no way a really good movie, I enjoyed it. Godzilla 14' entertained me until the end. I have seen every single Godzilla movie and this isn't even close to the worst ones.<br/><br/>The story is kinda bad. This movie focuses more on the humans than Godzilla, which I don't have a problem with, since they have done it in past Godzilla movies that were good. The problem with it focusing on the humans though it that the characters are plain and generic. They never fleshed out the humans enough for me to care about them and they made stupid choices turn after turn. Not to mention dialogue have continuity errors. Again they have done this in past Godzilla movies.<br/><br/>The acting was meh. Bryan Cranston gave the best performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was not that great, he just kinda stared and said things that furthered the plot. Elizabeth Olsen was just there as a plot device, she didn't have many lines. Ken Watanabe was just there to stare, talk about Godzilla, and correctly pronounce Gojira. Sally Hawkins was there for like 5 scenes and in every one she was annoying.<br/><br/>The camera work was good though. There were some nice shots that showed chaos throughout the city, the soldiers, the monsters, and hat HALO jump. One thing is for sure, it didn't look bad at all.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great too. The music makes you feel like you're in every situation and lends great to the Godzilla theme.<br/><br/>Godzilla 14' was OK, but the dark and gritty feel won me over to give it a 7/10. The movie wasn't horrible like people say it is, but it isn't a masterpiece. It is just a cool monster movie that is entertaining. If we would have gotten this in 98' no one would have complained. I really hope they improve upon this to make a great sequel, I can't wait to see Ghidorah in action again."

","In a lot of ways the Roland Emmerich Godzilla is an exhibit of '90s popular cinema, for better and for worse, and I think we'll feel the same about this one in about ten years' time. It's dark, gritty and menacing, often to a fault. The screen is awash with grays and browns. The important CG moments are impressive and generally perform well, but they're still quite obviously digital set pieces and feel unnatural. I did find a lot more to appreciate in the tone of this one than in its 1998 cousin, which wears a strong admiration of the Toho source material on its sleeve. In terms of focus, this could've passed for one of Japan's own: the screen spends far more time hovering around the human components than the monster himself, who's largely relegated to a cameo role. Those civilians are universal retreads, though, only vaguely interesting at their best moments. For the most part it's a very bland movie, slogging through a repetitive plot that had me checking my watch on the regular. The monster fisticuffs are cool, even if the impact of familiar skylines being toppled has lost some edge in the wake of Man of Steel, Pacific Rim and The Avengers, but even those are often tossed aside as afterthoughts. I lost count of how many times the screen cut away just as the king of monsters got his paws on an equally-oversized freak. Clearly it was a conscious decision to keep our perspective with the huddled masses, but that makes for a tough contradiction; artistic, yes; rewarding, no. The HALO jump seen in an early teaser trailer is probably the only thing I'll remember in a few months. Much less enthusiastic a revival than I was hoping for."

I waited for its DVD release then I bought it. I was so excited that I immediately put the disc on my DVD player. After I watched it then I said to myself, ""Good thing I didn't see this on the big screen."" I mean the movie was 2 hours long then Godzilla's screen time is only 10-11 minutes? It really disappointed me.<br/><br/>Well about the movie, the story is kinda flat but it had great cast. Too bad Bryan Cranston's character died early in the movie. The only scenes that I liked in the movie was the final fight where Godzilla fights the MUTO. Well at least it was better than the Godzilla 1998.

"snmeesala101","7","1","2","24 December 2014"," Not a total waste of time.
","There are some spoilers. Don't read unless you have seen the movie. <br/><br/>I don't understand why most people hated it. Although it wasn't the best action/sci-fi movie compared to the other options available, Godzilla wasn't too terrible as reviewed. <br/><br/>1. Godzilla's appearance. Yes, Godzilla got a little screen time as hoped but it was for a valid reason. The movie portray Godzilla as nature's weapon against enormous creature. Its a basic logic of food chain. There can only be one predator who can be dominant. Godzilla, who had stayed dominant for years, needs to establish his power. Thus, he acts like a predator, tracking his prey and coming in for the sneak attack. Of course he is not going to get a lot of screen time! He being late for the party makes him adds more to his bad-ass character. <br/><br/>2. As for the characters, I felt that it was imperative that they kill off the scientist. In most sci-fi movies, it is the crazy maniac that drives the plot and the search for the solution to the conflict. The father dying was important for the son to gain closure and understanding of the truth of the creatures. Plus, because of his death, the story line became more original. It became a story of a soldier trying to get home to his family in midst of a crisis. He was willing to do whatever it takes to do so. Everyone else were simply bystanders to nature's course. <br/><br/>3. Military's failure to learn their lesson. The Japanese scientist mentioned that man's arrogance is that they think they can control/dominate nature. This movie depicts that very arrogance. They don't trust what they don't know. They use whatever they have at their disposal to take care of a threat. They think they are powerful enough to take care of any threat. Thus, they continue to do stupid mistakes because they are incapable of thinking beyond their ego and understanding that their power is limited compared nature. Their mistakes and put into positions where they are powerless was to show how little we are compared to the forces of nature. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie did an okay job of displaying the theme- humans are not as powerful as they seem to be. Nature can take care of itself and should not be tampered with. Switching the perspective from a scientist searching for answers to a soldier. It made the movie original. A soldier trying to get to his family added a more human element to the mix which made it all the more enjoyable. The action sequences were intense and never a let down. The ending where Godzilla collapses out of exhaustion was realistic and I'm glad they added it. The movie was not a complete letdown as made out to be."
"feelingchimpy","5","1","2","29 September 2014"," Fell Short of My Expectations
","I grew up with the Gojira films. There was a monumental amount of hype surrounding Godzilla (2014) throughout the fanbase, and it was contagious. I went into the theaters excited beyond belief for what I would be presented with, but the film didn't have the impact I had hoped for. <br/><br/>While the movie looked AMAZING down to every last detail, the story fell short. There was too much emphasis on the human characters with how uninteresting they were. I wouldn't have been disappointed by this if the main character (Ford, even though the trailers left me believing his father - the only interesting character in the movie - would be taking us through the story) had been interesting and engaging, but he just wasn't. I don't believe it was the fault of the actor, the character was just lackluster and more suited for a side character or a background character than the lead, in my opinion. His father would have made for a much more interesting lead character and the film would have been much more enjoyable if he had taken us through the story.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself didn't get much screen time, and up until the ending, the majority of his shots were quick cutaways, teasing glimpses, or obscured by darkness or smoke. He looked amazing in what shots he was clearly visible, but there weren't enough of them to keep me satisfied. It was frustrating to watch this film and get teased with almost being able to see him clearly, or to almost see him fight the MUTOS, only to be cut away just as the action was beginning. With how incredible the ending fight was (especially the atomic breath!), it just didn't make up for the rest of the film. The film seemed to focus more around the MUTOS than Godzilla himself, which would have worked out fine if it were a sequel and Godzilla had already had his introduction. As it was, this version of Godzilla hadn't been introduced to the audience before this film, and having this Godzilla treated as a side character in his debut film just didn't satisfy me. <br/><br/>Despite my complaints, I don't necessarily dislike this movie. Its fine... but only fine. I have seen it multiple times and did purchase the DVD, but I wont be watching it very often. Of the American Godzilla films, my DVD of Godzilla (1998) will be seeing much more use than Godzilla (2014). This just didn't live up to the hype and I was left overall disappointed. I might have enjoyed it more had I not been so hyped up and excited going into the theater with such high expectations."

"BecauseIAmBATMAN","6","1","2","24 August 2014"," A collection of epic moments, but not an epic movie it could have been
","There are some really incredible sequences in this film like A Halo Jump sequence and all the scenes with Godzilla in it. Whenever Godzilla shows his epic face or give out a roar, you might feel like cheering or clapping at his magnificence. The problem is that Godzilla is only in it for 10 minutes or so.<br/><br/>The director Gareth Edwards tries to focus on the human element, which is not a bad thing as the human element is necessary in any story. The main problem is the human characters are heavily clichéd and the lead protagonist is extremely bland. The only interesting human character I found in this film was Bryan Cranston's but sadly he doesn't have much screen time.<br/><br/>This film is about Godzilla fighting two other monsters called MUTO's who wreck destruction. All the destruction scenes are particularly well done. There might be an epic instance where we see two monsters face each other. But they cut the scene immediately to a more mundane scene, this happens a couple of times. The Buildup extremely well done but we don't get much payoff. Although we do get to see a fight at the end. The pretty great buildup at the start of the film become mere teases after an hour or so which is kind of frustrating and off putting. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite entertaining although has a bunch of flaws in the writing department. Watch it the for Godzilla and some incredibly epic moments which will make you cheer. <br/><br/>6.5/10"

","So, from when I was little I have been watching godzilla movies. But when I started to grow up, I could see the bad costumes and effects in the movies. Then came the 1998 godzilla. This wasn't godzilla in my opinion, but it actually was a good movie all in all. The zilla wasn't powerful enough and didn't look bad ass. But the agility and creativity was great!<br/><br/>So the new trailer for the 2014 godzilla arrived and it looked awesome! No more childish costumes and a bad ass looking godzilla! It looked like a horror / action monster movie!<br/><br/>Then I finally watched it. Naah. It was a movie worth seeing and thats it. The horror wasn't there at all, there was bad acting, the storyline was thin and worst of all.. Godzilla looked like a mix between a turtle and a fat grandmother.. The head and the spikes were awesome, but the rest of the creature.. sigh. Why FAT? Why the small arms and tiny head for that body? Watch the ending of the movie and you will see the belly of an fat old lady. The roar didn't make me smile like the old movies, even the 1998 zilla got that right!<br/><br/>But I am giving it a 6 because of the animations and the fights that are shown. The battles between godzilla and the monsters is 5 points alone! Godzilla is Fugly as hell, but it can fight! And then I would give it 1 point for a better story in the beginning at the movie. It lives near the core of the planet and they tried nuke it before. That was gold! But living on radiation alone would mean they suck radiation from the core, not eating it like the movie. Eat radiation? I don't think so. <br/><br/>It is worth watching, but a huge letdown compared to the trailer. I am still waiting for a real godzilla movie. Power, storyline, acting and a hardcore looking godzilla! All these have never been found in a godzilla movie, but it comes closer and I will watch them all to find it!"
"swellframe17","6","1","2","23 July 2014"," Godzilla looks great, but the films has its faults.
","I don't know a lot about the Godzilla films. I've only watched the disappointing Roland Emmerich 1998 film and only small bits of the old ones. I watched the trailer for Gareth Edward's ""Godzilla"" and became very interested in this adaptation. From the trailer, it looked visually stunning and intense. I have to say, though, I was a let down by this film.<br/><br/>The story is mostly about Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his encounters with Godzilla. They conveniently meet from Japan to Hawaii to California as Godzilla tries to find and destroy two new monsters who were released (the trailer made no mention of these two creatures). There is another storyline with Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who gives us background information about the new Godzilla.<br/><br/>Godzilla looks great in this film. He is huge and looks very realistic. Every time he comes on the screen it's really good. However, Edwards makes this film like Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" so we don't get to see Godzilla as much. The film decides to follow the humans more and tries to be a character drama. I don't think this worked out though. <br/><br/>I felt like the characters were thinly scripted. We've seen these kind of characters before. The performances aren't bad, but I never felt emotionally engaged with any of them. The cast is great with Oscar winner Juliette Binoche and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. It even has Bryan Cranston who seems to have won everything except an Oscar, but I just didn't feel connected to them. I didn't really care for them.<br/><br/>The story is forced and has a few plot holes. Many people just happen to be in the right place at the right time. It can be kind of repetitive. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography really saves this film. It looks great and really captures the grand scale of Godzilla. He makes great use of blacks and reds throughout the film. <br/><br/>Edward's ""Godzilla"" is a blockbuster reboot that looks great, but has a weak story. The film is at its best when Godzilla holds the screen. It'll wow you."
"huggiebearthedestroyer","5","1","2","20 July 2014"," It's a mixed bag.
","First off, I'd like to say that despite Godzilla being a complete bad ass and having amazing CGI, it's just a normal every day ""Soldier needs to get back home to his family"" love story cliché. *Spoilers beyond this point, so if you haven't seen the movie, please do not read ahead* Godzilla, himself, was amazing. Welcome back Big G, and the CGI was phenomenal. But, that does NOT make a movie good. I knew I wasn't going to see Godzilla too much. After all, it was supposed to pay homage to the classic. I knew it was going to be more of a human story, but that's where this fails. Most of the characters are unlikable and the ones that are likable do top notch performances. But even then, you're still stuck with Aaron Taylor Johnson as a bland soldier. Now I like A.T.J. but this is not the best performance I've seen from him. Elizabeth Olsen was sort of likable, but all you really remembered her as was a nurse. Cranston, Watanabe, and Binoche are easily the best characters, but they're not even there for too long. Cranston and Binoche both die in the first 20 minutes. While I knew Binoche was going to die, the way how they just killed off Cranston was unforgivable. There are little to no monster fights, end even so, they cut away from it. ""It's just paying homage!"" Bullshit. The classic didn't cut away from ANYTHING. Watanabe was great too, but even then, he wasn't even shown too much. And the Muto, while I thought were pretty terrifying and unique from the pictures I've seen, were just knock off Cloverfields and Starship Trooper bugs. And what sucks even more is that the story is focusing on them instead of Godzilla. I payed to see Godzilla, not these pussies. Plus what's with this whole ""Change everything"" Re-Make stuff. The classic was fine as it was. It's like having a spider man re-make and changing 90% of the characters and changing the storyline. However, the first 20 minutes are perfect, same with the ending fight (The ending scene was just cringe worthy, as in ""Hail Godzilla, king of the monsters"" cheesiness). It's definitely not the best, it's not the worst (Although it isn't far) and it's over all, just boring and bland with the stupidest army I've seen, with very little (But great) pay off, and is wonderfully shot and again, has 5 star CGI. I'm totally fine if you like it. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. But with me, I'm going to settle with Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah as my top favorite."

Still, this isn't bad, it just seems like a big disappointment (although it also could have been way worse). The acting is good, for the most part. Cranston is aces, as is Elizabeth Olsen. Aaron Taylor Johnson, though, once again remains completely charmless and has no screen presence. Why keep casting him? Because he's hot, right? The character development in this really needed work, as did the screenplay. It's very ho-hum. The directing is adequate though, and the action scenes do hold up well.

","This Godzilla movie while a refreshing call back to the old Japanese movies, still failed to deliver a good Godzilla movie. While not nearly as bad as the Broderick movie, this Godzilla movie was still poorly done.<br/><br/>When one goes to see a giant monster movie, do we really need to see the actions of one or two humans? They had giant monsters fighting in cities, but where they went wrong is the constantly refocusing onto the human actors. The monsters were enough. There was no reason to focus on the humans, and quite frankly they annoyed the heck out of me. If it had just been Godzilla invading a city, then it would have been fine to have some focus dedicated to the human defenders. But this movie would have been so much better if they had kept the focus on Godzilla and the giant monster fight.<br/><br/>The other thing that confused me at least was the ending. What was with the attempt to make Godzilla out to be the world's white blood cell? He's a giant monster. We don't need to think of him as some giant Superman. It was pointless and seemed just to be there to create some kind of touchy-feely ending which was unneeded."

","When you have movie named ""Godzilla"" you expect to see a movie in which Godzilla would be prominent throughout the adventure. Instead, we get a 2-hour movie in which we get 15-20 minutes of Godzilla and 2 hours of filler.<br/><br/>Won't bore you with the script, only to say it's a bit sappy and hackneyed. The parts with Godzilla are understated, fleeting and uninspired. No epic or memorable moments. No exciting battles.<br/><br/>The production value of the film was good and the graphics were fairly well done. Parts of the storyline were also well written. So, overall I will give this mercy rating of a 6. This will not be added to my Blu-ray collection until it reaches the sub $3 range. It had such great promise, but failed to deliver."

","I was excited to see Godzilla. I'm a fan of the films since I was a kid. What I did like was the adult approach they took with the material, there were some things that were fun and others were very disjointed. I felt like maybe they had cut out 30 mins out of the film. While some of the story was done well, for god sakes they made a movie about a giant monster semi-believable the big problem is the cast, the film felt as if they they really missed the make with the cast, maybe if there are missing scenes that will fill in why everything felt so flat. <br/><br/>Fun popcorn movie but not much more, might want to wait for it to hit DVD or catch a daytime show for cheap."
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","6","1","2","11 June 2014"," A Mixed-Bag
","Godzilla is a 2014 American science fiction monster film directed by Gareth Edwards. The film is the second attempt at a Hollywood reboot of the Godzilla film franchise, following the disastrous attempt by Roland Emmerich in 1998. The film stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston, alongside Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. <br/><br/>Mostly identifiable from his successful low budget film 'Monsters', Edwards attempts to take some of the concentrated interior conflicts from the characters in this previous film, and apply them to this film, set to the backdrop of the destruction of America at the hands of the King of the Monsters. Whilst an initial lengthy and thorough exploration into the characters themselves does provide the basis for the following chaos and destruction to have some substance behind it, it results in an opening act which feels sluggish. Additionally, whether it is through his roaring screech or enormous shadow, Godzilla is consistently teased to the audience in an attempt to increase anticipation for his first appearance. The persistent and over-implementation of this technique however simply builds frustration rather than excitement. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Godzilla's initial appearance is undoubtedly powerful. Never has his vast scaly body looked so beautiful, and never has his ear-piercing roar sounded so authentic and frightening. The CGI as a matter of fact is almost faultlessly immersive throughout the entirety of the film, as is the sound design and hypnotic soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. Greatly to the director's credit, the film from this point does manage to maintain a feeling of panic and horror, and does manage to hit many of the emotional beats that felt lacking during the film's first half. <br/><br/>Fascinatingly, this is both the film's greatest asset yet also its biggest hindrance. The film excels so marvelously in its final acts that it leaves its opening feeling dry and even somewhat mechanical. All things considered, the film is clearly a mixed-bag, but a worthwhile watch nonetheless."

","Excellent special effects! The guys that worked on the monsters and city models...Kudos for all your excellent work!!!. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the writers and director :( Brody is in the Navy yes? Lucky him as a Lieutenant, he had free reign throughout this movie during this event. The writers seemed to be reaching for touchy feelings but too quickly in all the scenes I saw. The Director...I'm sorry, I was disappointed. If the scene does not work right, don't just give up and send to print...do it over..get it right. wtf was that. Do you know how to pull talent from these guys? Almost like you squeezed a 3 hour movie into 30 min...things moved too fast. Navy ships sailing alongside Godzilla as though you were long time buddies only to blast him the first chance you get. wtf ...again. Sad..I have only walked out on one movie in my life...quarantine. I was falling asleep during this one and when it was coming to an end, I was getting out of my chair heading for the exit much sooner than I normally do. Again, special effects were great..for that I give a 10+. For the writers and directors...2 and that is stretching it. Poor Watenabe...a Tremendous and awe-inspiring actor with more talent in his pinky than the writers and directors had in their entire staff. I hope this does not mar his career."

","I'm going to give this a 5 because it's Godzilla. He is the greatest monster in movies of all time. I love how he states this in the movie. It' a like he does a most muscular pose in making his point. <br/><br/>The main problem, and there were many, was that there just wasn't enough of him. We don't want to see sappy family reunions, we want to see the baddest monster of all time. He is the god of monsters and it's him we want to see. Ken Watanabe stands around the whole movie looking stunned and amazed. He was never proactive yet he has the most info on the monsters of anyone in the film. And the whole thing about the military firing guns. It's like they have no idea what they're up against, as if guns will help. That's just a leap of logic in 2014. If you know a weapon has no use, the military in that context is impotent, so more intelligent and creative methods should have been shown to initiate military operations.The whole family sappy film stuff is just too much. When did I feel the most emotion, not when the family got reunited I'll tell you that. I teared up a little at the other moment. If you like Godzilla you'll know when. The movie was 30 minutes too long."

"humansbreakfest-10-873424","3","1","2","1 June 2014"," Extraordinary Action Sequences, Mediocre Plot and Acting
","If you are a fan of Godzilla, chances are that you'll love the reboot. I left the theater loving it myself, but it didn't take long for me to realize that there are several somewhat crippling flaws to the movie. However, the reason they don't much make a difference is simple; very few of them have to do with Godzilla himself. <br/><br/>To put it briefly, the primary problem with Godzilla (The movie, not the monster) can be summed up in three words. Aaron Taylor Johnson. I'm not trying to be too hard on the guy, because I do like him, but he is the pinnacle of mediocrity in this movie. His character could win the Oscar for Most Generic Protagonist. The plot rests so heavily on him as a character, and while Johnson is a good actor, his character is given so little personality and Johnson does so little with the personality he HAS been given. He just can't hold up the weight of the leading character.<br/><br/>That role should have been given to Bryan Cranston or Ken Watanabe, as both have better parts in the movie and both are better actors than Johnson (No offense Kick-Ass). It's bizarre just how little screen time the two are given despite the fact that they both have interesting, flawed personalities. The issue of the terrible lead is only exacerbated by the movie's attempt to hold off unleashing Godzilla until the final moments. Yes, this decision, one made for the purpose of inducing suspense, is one that I can admire, but it is executed somewhat poorly. We see Godzilla first after about 1/3rd of the movie, and so holding him off at that point is strange given that we've already see him in his true form. <br/><br/>However, keeping Godzilla from chewing up the scenery (Figuratively and literally) does work out well in the final moments. The last twenty minutes of Godzilla (Again, the movie) are spectacular. We get to see Godzilla battle with two other giant monsters in an extraordinary and grand fashion. It's simply stellar, and everyone in the theater drew aback in awe of the size and scope of the finale. However, because the the first 3/4ths of the movie focus more on the characters and the aforementioned two other creatures, neither of whom are as cool or interesting as 'Zilla himself, the film suffers. <br/><br/>But as I said, Godzilla fans will love this installment, because it brings to the table a reboot of the King of the Monsters with style and panache greater than any other film in the franchise. Plus, the series was never known for incredible acting: it's known for having giant lizards kicking each other around a whole bunch. And for those of us who LOVE to see giant lizards kicking each other around, Godzilla 2014 ultimately delivers there. But as for the plot and characters, two aspects of the film that were given much time and attention but not a whole lot of talent, they suck. <br/><br/>But let's face it, you already know if you want to see a Godzilla movie before you even see it."
"globalzjay","5","1","2","28 May 2014"," About Godzilla
","Now I agree with a previous reviewer actually having seen the movie that for a movie with the title Godzilla, Godzilla features about 10% of the movie. The other prehistoric creatures feature more than Godzilla. With that being said however, Godzilla was actually believable, well portrayed and not cheesy. Just didn't feature him enough.<br/><br/>The story line was well thought out, it wasn't cheesy or overly predictable for this type of feature or franchise. For the mere fact though that Godzilla was featured so in frequently in the movie I gave it a five out of ten. For me it was underdeveloped."
"cwalk38","5","1","2","28 May 2014"," Same beat formula, no payoff
","The movie starts out by piling on unexplained phenomena. All this mystery never really leaves to any payoff. You don't go into a Godzilla movie expecting any deep level of realism, but the attempts of this movie to develop a plot or offer any kind of buyable explanation fall terribly short. As the same old ""giant ancient monsters"" formula went into effect, I hoped for some redeeming epic battle scenes...but nope, just the same plot plateauing for almost two hours. After the first 20-30 minutes, I may as well have been watching the same scene over and over until the end which was a slightly more exciting version of the same scene."
"tariq-hossenbux","Null","1","2","27 May 2014"," CGI Combines WIth a 50s Feel
","Godzilla boasts some very impressive CGI effects and panoramic views. But to really enjoy this film it requires that you sit back, suspend your disbelief totally, immerse yourself in a mindset that people in the 50s had. Have some popcorn and imagine you are there. And the film sports some first person perspectives that really get there. Atomic science was a new and mysterious thing and the film tries to portray that with a foggy atmosphere in the opening stages. And those opening stages are slow to develop building suspense. As the nature of Godzilla and his purposes are revealed the film also becomes brighter in lighting. Imagine the fear of an audience afraid of what might become of the world in the nuclear age, and Godzilla will seem all that much more fearsome for it. It is very much in the style of 50s monster movies too and as such it is much of a time warp as an impressive display of modern CGI technology."

"TheBarleyGuy","6","1","2","26 May 2014"," Not bad, but not what I hoped for.
","You've all seen the trailers, you've all heard of the giant lizard monster, and you guys all know the deal. So, here's the plot just for the sake of tradition. The world's most famous monster is pitted against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity's scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence.<br/><br/>Alright, so that's aside now, and you guys know I'm probably going to be throwing in some spoilers here, so I'm going to tell you guys what I thought. <br/><br/>I'm going to start with the positive first, because the movie is not without it's definite positives.First off, Godzilla looks f**king fantastic. The old monster design is back, and it is so satisfying to see ol' chubby legs stomping around again. Especially after his abhorrent makeover in the 90s flick we all hated. The effects are great, and you get a pretty good sense of the enormity of this huge monster. <br/><br/>On top of that, the monster fights are absolutely fantastic. The devastation and mayhem they cause is really fun to watch and really does bring out what you want in a monster movie. <br/><br/>I'll be totally honest, there's a moment in the movie when Godzilla's tail lights up in blue, and he just blasts the Coverfield monster with super awesome electric blasts. So wildly satisfying. <br/><br/>Speaking of Cloverfield monsters, the two creatures Godzilla does battle with are basically that monster. One has wings, one doesn't, both are serious s**t-stompers and again, just such great effects in the monster department. <br/><br/>Alright, now it's time to talk about the negative. I wish I could say that this movie was the cinematic event of the summer, and I think everyone should go out and see it, and it's the greatest monster movie in the history of time. <br/><br/>The thing is you guys, I was genuinely disappointed. The trailers for this movie kept the suspense at just the right level, we got an idea of what was coming, and it got people wildly excited. Myself included. I was on board the hype-train in the biggest way. <br/><br/>This is where the first problem arrives. The movie tries to build suspense and build up to the arrival of Godzilla, for way too long. As far as I'm concerned, Godzilla should have been on screen right after his name came up on the screen with epic music behind it. Needless to say, he isn't. <br/><br/>This movie runs at just over 2 hours, and Godzilla is probably on screen for around 40 minutes. So we have a Godzilla movie with very little Godzilla, and we spend a good majority of the movie following around Bryan Cranston's son as he tries to help the military and make his way back to his wife. I mean, maybe it's just me, but I don't really give a s**t what the military is doing, or the human drama around a soldier and his wife and kid in a GODZILLA MOVIE! I'm there to see God-f**king-zilla smash cities and fight monsters. It just didn't really fit the spirit of what I know Godzilla movies to be. Or even really what monster movies should be. <br/><br/>Another big problem, that is kind of related to the last one, is that the monster battles seem to happen in the back ground of the movie almost. <br/><br/>Remember Cloverfield? The monster and its rampage took place in the background because of the perspective that found-footage movies have. It made sense then, and whether you loved or hated that movie, you can probably agree to that much. Well, this movie has a similar feel even though it is told in a traditional way, you could have incredible monster battles or rampages and not need to worry about the justification. Instead we follow people, on the ground instead of showing the devastation of what is going on. <br/><br/>Alright, I'm going to stop there so that this review doesn't go on forever. so lets get down to what I thought overall. So, in general, the movie is fun and does have some hugely satisfying moments. However, it just doesn't deliver what I wanted in a GODZILLA reboot. The performances are relatively bland from the main characters, but we do get some awesome performances from Ken Watanabe (Inception), and Bryan Cranston of course does deliver, however I have to say, this movie does pull a ""Place Beyond The Pines"" where he's concerned. That's a pretty major spoiler if you've seen The Place Beyond the Pines, but yeah. He really isn't in it as long as you expect him to be. <br/><br/>Aaron Tyler Johnson (Kick-A*s) is bland, and forgettable and Elizabeth Olsen hasn't really got anything to do except be sad that her husband isn't around. The movie honestly focuses way too much on these characters, and that is a real part of the reason the movie doesn't do what I wanted it to. <br/><br/>I'm not going to tell you it's a BAD movie, because it really isn't. It just wasn't what I had hoped for from a Godzilla movie. I had personally hoped for something a little more like Pacific Rim, straight into the action and watching our dear old friend Godzilla stomp around. I just didn't get that. It felt like it was in the wrong spirit, and that was really the issue that disappointed me. <br/><br/>Is it good? Sure. Is it what it was built up to be? No. It just isn't."
"matic-boh1","6","1","2","26 May 2014"," Nowhere near its potential, yet enjoyable
","Perhaps the most highly anticipated film of the 2014 summer season that masterfully built up suspense in the trailers leading up to it, Godzilla adds new life and excitement to the long-lasting franchise, yet one is left feeling slightly dissatisfied with the finished product. Surprisingly enough, the film places humans in the forefront, mainly focusing on character development rather than the exploits of the notorious monster. Although this approach is successfully executed, with Bryan Cranston being particularly deserving of praise and Aaron-Tyler Johnson also giving a solid performance, it does result in Godzilla becoming a character driven film, which ultimately hurts its essence. However, despite the fact that it presents the audience with an unexpected and uncharacteristic framework, the film does manage to maintain its trademark thrilling style. Godzilla is undoubtedly an enjoyable cinematic experience, and even though it offers far less action than one would anticipate, it is worth watching for the gripping visual and sound effects alone."
"jdr041091","6","1","2","26 May 2014"," Went in with expectations, Left still expecting.
","After watching the trailer and TV commercials for Godzilla, My first reactions were 'i have to see this', so i did and if I'm 100% honest, i was left expecting a lot more. Now as you may see in any of my other reviews I'm short and sweet so i will conduct my review of Godzilla in the same manner, The first 50 minutes i was glued to the screen, just waiting for that glimpse of Godzilla in his remastered beauty, now believe me its worth the wait. The special effects and CGI are impeccable Godzilla is scary in his own right but sad to say this was where i lost interest as after seeing Godzilla the story line was bland and predictable, i hoped Bryan Cranston would have a much larger role as he has produced some amazing work as of late and i hoped this would follow suit. Basically keeping it short the longer i got into the movie the more my interest declined and it basically became an 'hurry up and end' affair for me as i had already predicted outcome and i wasn't wrong. In a nutshell the visual and audio aspects of the movie are 10/10 but the story lets it down massively leaving me giving the film a 6/10 with the old saying 'great potential but could have done better'."
"agmoldham","5","1","2","26 May 2014"," Much better than last Godzilla!
","I couldn't really remember a lot about the 1998 Godzilla except for bit where Godzilla's eye opened. Come to think of it I've been on here that long I probably have a review of the film on here!<br/><br/>Anyway got to say that I thought the 2014 Godzilla was pretty entertaining. The story revolves around the reawakening of 2 monsters which causes Godzilla to also wake from his slumber. The good thing about this is that there is good acting in the movie as well as the monster destruction! You do have an interest in the characters and care whether they live or die and the same applies to Godzilla! A pretty entertaining summer blockbuster!"
"chowdhurytuhin","6","1","2","20 May 2014"," Could have been one of the greatest monster movies but....
","Godzilla means jaw dropping humongous monster which has an attitude as big as his body. This movie tries to be different. Quiet similar to the treatment in the movie Cloverfield (one of the best monster movies). If both were videogames. Cloverfield was a first person shooter and Godzilla is ""mostly"" a third person shooter but...both follow a protagonist. Interestingly, the second monster is very very similar to the monster of Cloverfield. Suspense is the key to a monster movie...Godzilla 2014 over-killed it. The first half drags but the second half makes up for that. I am 32 and i grewup on Godzilla, King-Kong B-Grade VHS tapes and Godzilla toys and am a fan of Godzilla 1998. When i watch these new movies of King- Kong or Godzilla i relive that child within me. This movie did just that but only in the second half. One time watch."
"gengar843","6","1","2","20 May 2014"," Fair Vote for a Fair Movie
","Let's begin with my biography, which appears to be mandatory for rating any Godzilla movie. Love Godzilla. Now I have cred.<br/><br/>(1) The opening buildup was fantastic, and the death scene of scientists trapped beneath the crumbling nuclear facility was crushing. So... why all of a sudden am I 15 years in the future when I have invested so much emotion into that little family from 1999? I now have to begin all over again getting to know new characters. Within 5 minutes I hate them. Young Ford was worthwhile, adult Ford is a chiseled dummy. His wife is so damn cute and that is a problem, because I know where this is leading, that she is the bestest in the whooooole world. And she is. And that is not the world we live in. And I am not willing to suspend disbelief and invest myself into that single-dimension female, just so I can be manipulated by her perfect nose! <br/><br/>(2) Godzilla comes to our attention in this movie with too much fake mystery. There is a false sense of wonder about a creature we obviously know and love for 60 years. OK, the ""reveal"" is important. But this one is not spectacular. This Godzilla is somewhere between a big fat oaf and a steroid-filled athlete, like Mark McGwire's forearms. He's formidable, don't get me wrong, just overstuffed.<br/><br/>There is also an issue with Godzilla's origin, which seems far too fluffy, to the point where Hiroshima is but a sidebar. Let's face it, it's 2014, and today's audience does not have the same perspective on 1945 that audiences did in 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984, and so forth. More exposition was necessary.<br/><br/>(3) As one reviewer pointed out, there are umpteen plot holes, stupid plot devices, inconsistencies, scientific protocol errors, film continuity misses, and so forth. Where does one begin? Let's take the bridge scene. Really? Firing towards monsters while the bridge is filled with military personnel and civilians? Really? A bus driver maniacally running down cops and soldiers without being shot at? Really? The bus is blocked by a giant piece of bridge which is magically gone the next shot? <br/><br/>(4) These MUTO's are straight from Cloverfield, with a bit more characterization, mostly boring. Most Godzilla monsters are cool, these are sterile. The EMP-causing gimmick wore thin, was unbelievable, was badly carried out by the director of the film, and was circumvented by errors in continuity. My biggest issue was the egg-sac being dragged around on the female's rear end. In one scene, the egg-sac was displayed so that Ford could've simply shot it out and ended that menace. But I guess we needed to save the eggs for the ""suspenseful"" sequence where Ford ""heroically"" sets fire to the eggs with a ""convenient"" gasoline source. Cut-rate Aliens.<br/><br/>(5) I liked the Godzilla fight scenes but, honestly, they lacked depth. The 1990's Godzilla movies are famous for entire-city miniature sets being destroyed by rubber-suited Godzilla vs. cool nemesis. Those scenes rock, even though you can tell they're fake. This movie aspired to realism, in some degree, yet was ultimately stymied on how to improve on the rubber suit, even with CGI. It's a close call but I don't agree that this Godzilla was particularly amazing. He was fairly clumsy, pretty lucky, and not a good fighter. His laser breath was good, but, as with most Godzilla movies, why didn't he just use that breath earlier and end it? The CGI was, honestly, not THAT impressive, and Godzilla's roar was not authentic, nor particularly stimulating or scary, just typically hysterical for our age of imitation.<br/><br/>(6) I think Ford's son was so much dead weight, almost a mental cripple. I don't think he said one word in the film, because even his ""mommy"" was yelled off-camera. Maybe I'm wrong about that one detail but wow, I really hated that kid.<br/><br/>Speaking of kids, what was the purpose of the separated Japanese child in the subway? To show Ford's bravery? And that grabbing scene is straight out of Aliens.<br/><br/>(7) I've seen Prometheus several times, mostly because I like it as a train wreck of acting, plot, dialogue, and etc. This film is not even half as bad as Prometheus, and therefore must impress me otherwise. In that respect, I would watch this Godzilla because it's Godzilla, and for Elizabeth Olsen's pert nose. Maybe on TV it will translate better.<br/><br/>Cloverfield and Pacific Rim were sold 8-9 in my book. This film is a 6, maybe even a 7 if you are very forgiving of senselessness and illogical situations."
"TheNineOrders","6","1","2","19 May 2014"," Godzilla is just a supporting cast!
","I would like to start by answering the question is it worth watching. Yes, Godzilla is worth watching but not in theaters. The experience does not bring any excitement on the big screen. Sound is subdued and chaotic and the CGI is not that high quality. Darkness, smoke and debris take too much of the effects details away and are there clearly to hide the imperfections of the creatures. Wait for it to premiere on your premium movie channels.<br/><br/>Now the plot. Creatures called MUTOs exist on the world and feed on radiation. Radiation levels on the planet decreased forcing the creatures to burrow deeper into the crust of the Earth to feed on the radiation from the core. First big problem here is that the creatures seemed to be dormant just beneath the surface since one is found in a cave system at about 3 hundred feet deep and the other was hibernating inside a military complex for nuclear waste disposal. That does not seem to be deep enough to feed on the planets' core. The male calls for the female MUTO for breeding yet the females' eggs appear to be embryos before meeting her male counterpart, what was the mating call for? The creatures feed on radiation yet Godzilla shoots radiation from its mouth and it hurts the MUTOs. What?<br/><br/>Acting is boring and uninteresting and the thought I shouldn't be alive comes to mind about plenty of the characters. Verdict: Entertaining, not the greatest movie everybody claims it to be."
"xelalex73","5","1","2","19 May 2014"," Disappointing
","Went to see it with awfully high expectations and ended up being terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's as bad as the 1998 Roland Emmerich crap fest, but still this Godzilla has no soul.<br/><br/>I'm aware monster movies are supposed to be campy entertainment, and that's what I wanted to see!, I have no friggin' idea what Gareth Edwards intentions were!, the film is bland, boring, badly paced, the human characters are stupid and non sensical, and the monsters lack any real punch, even Gojira himself seemed overweight and weak, and the idea to make him a sort of antihero didn't work at all!<br/><br/>I grew up on all the Japanese movies from the 50's 60's and 70's and I can honestly say, as ""bad"" and corny and cheap as they may seem, they had more heart and authenticity than this version, still cannot fathom how this one has so many positive reviews!, half the audience at the theater was bored as hell halfway across the movie, and the worst part is they gave the lamest explanation for Gojira's genesis, in other words, I'm as ignorant as its origins as I was before going in to see the film."
"nikkimorningstar","6","1","2","17 May 2014"," Conflicted
","My disclaimer is that I saw the film once, and did not take any notes. Usually, I view a film a few times before drawing any sort of conclusion.<br/><br/>The film opens with a methodically paced family scene that works mostly because of the audience's expectation of an impending disaster, as well as Bryan Cranston's solid portrayal of an engineer agonized by the death of his wife. During these scenes, small details are played up (the fact that the disaster happens on his birthday, attention to small objects) and these details prove to be largely irrelevant to the overall film.<br/><br/>The inclusion of so much information seems to be a shortcoming of the film makers and/or writers, as this information goes nowhere and comments on nothing.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe was excellent choice, though his character has very few lines. He is able to sell the glaring-into-the-distance-with-a-look-that-says-more-than-words Godzilla stare. So he and Cranston, at first, appear as though they will be the solid leads to carry the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the Cranston character dies we realize that the lead is his Blandy McBlandness naval officer of a son. A Naval Officer who diffuses bombs...and...oh my god, there is a bomb to diffuse! Though he...doesn't have to actually ever do that, but he's along for the ride anyway to save his family or input-plot-point-here. <br/><br/>Therein lies my biggest problem with the film, Blandy McBlandness, his wife Ms McBlandness and their son Sam McBlandness. Their family struggle is supposed to be a central element, and not only does it not matter, but their plight is a useless contrivance aimed at coercing the average viewer into caring. <br/><br/>SOUND: The sound in the film is exceptional, though it should be noted that it is ever-present. Even in the most tense moments, the music remains constant, so much so that I was left with the impression that there was a 123 minute orchestral score to accompany the film. I'm not commenting on whether or not this is a good or bad thing, but rather just commenting on its presence.<br/><br/>I believe the score is there mostly to convey the sense that what the viewer is experiencing is ""epic"" and tied together in an ""epic"" fashion. Epic, as a style, has been the new norm in Hollywood cinema, so much so that those who do not abide by the expectations of ""epic"" create the films that currently stand out.<br/><br/>Honestly, I have conflicting opinions regarding the sound.<br/><br/>VISUALS: Visually this is one of the most beautiful films that has ever been. Good God, all of the scenes look great. There are so many moments of beautiful destruction, of well-choreographed camera work and of just mind-numbing eye candy that you just give up in considering how great it looks and just accept that it's damn-near perfect in that regard. <br/><br/>One thing I will comment on, that isn't so much a matter of the visuals themselves, but rather a choice on how to implement those visuals, is the portrayal of massive destruction and raw torquing forces. This choice falls into the bullshitty category of ""Transformers physics."" What I mean by what I have designated ""Transformers physics"" is the portrayal of forces capable of ripping apart buildings, of causing earthquakes, of creating a wake of civilization-ending-destruction in its path—that sort of force—and all the while, little people are running safely away from it—just barely making it, barley surviving every...single...time. So much so that you are embedded with the sense that the lead characters are in no danger, no matter what forces are involved. Such a knowledge of ""safe violence"" sucks the power out of the visuals.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>The family nonsense simply did not work. Short from Bryan Cranston selling the f***ing hell out of average writing, it was just a waste of time. The humans in the story are %100 percent irrelevant. Had they sat at home and ate Hot Pockets, the result would have been identical. They were dealing with forces far beyond themselves, and the story should have reflected such a powerlessness.<br/><br/>The soldiers in the film suit up Call of Duty style solely for aesthetic purposes. There is no point to their tactical awareness (taking cover behind cars, aiming in with their fingers off the trigger or even them having rifles). There is zero point in so much of what they do—other than for the sake of looking the part on film.<br/><br/>From a purely scientifically objective and critical viewpoint, every bit of monstery goodness was motherf***ing awesome. There should have been more of it. That may be the mindless meathead in me that wants to see Godzilla destroy stuff, but honestly, he was in very little of the film. Godzilla received the entrances and fight scenes he deserved but at very limited screen time in a very lengthy movie. <br/><br/>The classic Godzilla film elements were mirrored in the film: <br/><br/>Godzilla is somehow the underdog, and yet the alpha.<br/><br/>Godzilla is the peoples champion.<br/><br/>He has to be losing a large fight for an extended time.<br/><br/>He has to go down Hulk-Hogan style, only to pull out of it <br/><br/>and claim victory.<br/><br/>Finally, Jesus-style, he has to appear to have died, only to rise again. Ken Watanabe sells the Godzilla-Jesus amazingly well, as by his longing stare one can see how devastated he is by the loss of Godzilla—as if the limitlessness of nature were somehow quantified and mitigated by Godzilla's death. Then Watanabe brings it home with another stare—the awe-stricken relief and reverence at Godzilla's resurrection, as though his boyish faith in the king of monsters was always warranted. <br/><br/>I am with Watanabe and his thousand-yard stare. I have a childhood reverence for the king of monsters but am conflicted by the modern seriousness that seems to demand that such a film be taken seriously."

"dvc5159","6","1","2","16 May 2014"," Return of the King
","There is a scene in Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" that made my skin crawl. It is the HALO jump sequence, promoted heavily in the teaser trailer, accompanied by György Ligeti's hair-curling orchestral piece ""Requiem"", made famous in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" when Dave Bowman entered that portal. The sight of minuscule soldiers falling down into apocalyptic clouds as they see destruction all around them with gigantic, moving shadows is a work of terrifying, spectacular beauty; one of the best recent film sequences I've seen and heard. To experience it in IMAX 3D adds to the nightmare fuel.<br/><br/>Some other startling bits involve numerous disaster sequences that so closely echoes various natural disasters of the past decade. Viewers may be reminded of terrible events like the tsunamis and earthquakes of 2004 and 2011 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Scenes like these will definitely strike a chord in those who fear mother nature's wrath, but of course they play second fiddle to the real star of the show, who like Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"", doesn't show up until the latter half of the film, but one can definitely sense its brooding, commanding presence.<br/><br/>Yes, 60 Years since it laid waste to Tokyo, the King of the Monsters triumphantly returns to the big screen after a 10-year sabbatical in this mammoth-sized entertainment that shifts the Big G into summer blockbuster territory, obliterating Roland Emmerich's turkey into smithereens.<br/><br/>Like last summer's ""Pacific Rim"", ""Godzilla"" features gigantic-scale action set-pieces and crowd-pleasing moments, though in large part due to Edwards' skillful and intelligent direction, it entirely eclipses the latter film. Edwards (in only his second directorial feature following the 2010 microbudget ""Monster"") probably felt the same thing a lot of people did in ""Pacific Rim"" - too much action sequences that were dragged out for the purpose of pleasing its core audience. He is wise to limit Godzilla's appearance until the second half of the film, and even so limit his presence until the explosively entertaining climax, taking a page or two from Hitchcock and Spielberg's ""Jaws"" about restraint. The film was made with a ""spectator"" point of view - the audience sees Godzilla as if they were really seeing him, be it the TV screen or while avoiding the unrelenting chaos around them. Edwards didn't just learn from Spielberg as much as he pays a glowing tribute ala J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"". See if you can spot the references to ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"" in this review. There's even references to ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", among other movies. <br/><br/>Not that it isn't a real film. Whilst ""Pacific Rim"" is a film tailor-made for fans of the kaiju/mecha genre, in the same mold that most Marvel superhero films and 'Expendables' films cater to their target audiences, ""Godzilla"" is made like an old-fashioned blockbuster, down from its gripping, foreboding opening to its doom-shrouded action-packed climax that provides a well-earned catharsis to the ominous buildup from the previous 90-minutes. The action sequences are a combination of the classic kaiju franchise with the ominous Biblical paintings of Gustave Doré, especially in the final 30 minutes. Seamus McGarvey's tactful cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's brooding, wildly unleashing orchestral score complement some truly awesome visual effects perfectly to make for the most visually stunning outing of the King yet.<br/><br/>Not that there isn't a plot. Max Borenstein's screenplay details something too spoiler that even the mere mention of the basic plot will give away too much, so I won't But the trailers do a damn good job about hiding the true plot of the film, which I must say is formulaic on the human characters' side, but pretty well-written and frenetic for the most part.<br/><br/>Oh right, there are other cast members in the film too, all A-listers, ranging from a brief Bryan Cranston giving a combination of Roy Neary and Walter White, Ken Watanabe looking as wise and mournful as the great Takashi Shimura in the original, and a military David Strathairn giving heavy-duty exposition as usual. Add Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins and Elizabeth Olsen as obligatory female characters and we have ourselves a heck of a cast that is severely underused. But we didn't come to see a Godzilla movie for a cast surely deserving of an Oscar Bait film. Pretty much the only human who takes center stage is tough, stoic military vet Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Kick-Ass"" fame), who defiantly holds his own against all odds and comes off as a character who demands attention as to what his next plan of action is as chaos rumbles all around him.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, I liked what I saw, and Edwards has done a truly bang-up job resurrecting the King of the Monsters from cult fascination. If possible, watch it in IMAX 3D to savor the visual effects and sheer scale, and to hear that famous, mighty roar in terrifying rumbles. It's been a long time coming, but the King is back, and the monster movie is replenished with a vengeance. Would Toho/Legendary mind if I request a future outing?"
"shawneofthedead","5","1","2","19 May 2014"," An adequate monster movie that feels curiously characterless - a shame considering its impressive pedigree where director and cast are concerned.
","In all likelihood, this brand-new incarnation of Godzilla would have been met with far fewer expectations if director Gareth Edwards had never made Monsters. Edwards' ultra-indie, incredibly well-crafted creature feature - in which he magicked up creepy monsters and special effects on his own computer - served as so impressive a calling card that he was drafted in to breathe new life into this giant monster who hails from Japan. So great was Monsters that Edwards managed to amass a stunningly credible cast as well, from Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston through to indie darlings Sally Hawkins and David Straithairn. Alas, Edwards' Godzilla falls quite far short of the mark. Ultimately, there's neither enough story nor enough monster to keep the film going for as long as it does.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, the plot intends to focus on its human elements, and that works well enough at the beginning. We follow Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his assistant Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) into a cavern propped up by the age-worn bones of an ancient creature. So we know that something else is at work when the Japanese nuclear power plant overseen by Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) suffers a catastrophic meltdown. Joe loses his beloved wife (Juliette Binoche) in the accident, and effectively loses his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) as well.<br/><br/>Flash-forward fifteen years, and Ford is now an explosive ordinance officer - he detonates bombs - with a wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and son of his own. He's healed from the loss of his mom, or so you think, when he's forced to return to Japan to bail Joe out of prison. His father, you see, has remained obsessed for years with figuring out the real cause of the nuclear meltdown. And, as it turns out, the secret to that mystery is about to burst forth from the seas...<br/><br/>It's evident with every frame what Edwards is trying to do: develop real, believable human stakes that can lend weight to the monstrous carnage to be wrought by Godzilla and the Mutos - giant, bug-like creatures that first emerge to lay waste upon Earth. Serizawa and Graham search for motivation and make appeals on Godzilla's behalf; Ford must reconcile himself with the loss that transformed his father and his own life; Godzilla is the solution and not the problem. So on and so forth.<br/><br/>But the resulting movie frequently gets lost within its uneven, uninspiring script. The humans to whom we're introduced barely have any depth to speak of, the most egregious offender being Elle - she seems to exist merely to look devastated and/or scream helplessly in the tumultous streets of San Diego. Cranston does some pretty incredible work with what little he's given, but his screen-time is, unfortunately, limited. Taylor-Johnson looks good and occasionally elevates his material, but - especially in the second half of the film - is forced to lumber from action sequence to action sequence, barely registering as a fully-realised entity once the monsters have taken centre stage.<br/><br/>Just as unfortunate is the rendering of the monsters in Godzilla: not in a visual effects sense, but as characters. The titular beast barely gets a look-in. Even when all form of monster mayhem is unleashed in the second half of the movie, he's quite literally the supporting player in his own starring vehicle - and we're not just talking about playing second fiddle to the human cast. Godzilla stalks broodily in the wake of the Mutos, who effectively sideline the monster whose very name is in the title of the film. He looks great and moves well, but it's hard to care all that much when his appearances are as relatively fleeting as they are.<br/><br/>It's not that Godzilla is a complete mess; it isn't. It's perfectly watchable, there are some super-cool action sequences, and Edwards - as befitting his own not-so-secret past as a Godzilla junkie - laces the film with in-jokes and references that will please those well-schooled in the giant monster's lore and backstory. But that can't quite salvage the film from what it turns out to be: a competent if not particularly compelling monster movie, one which occasionally demonstrates but largely lacks the bite, energy and charisma of Edwards' debut feature film."
"drottin","5","1","2","19 May 2014"," Great effects, mediocre screenplay and acting
","First off, yes this movie is entertaining, but only the animated monster- fighting and the collapsing of buildings. The screenplay and acting seemed to me like they used 90% of the time making the Godzilla scenes and at the end remembered the scenes with actors and didn't have enough time to pull if off. Around me in the cinema I could hear laughing when emotional scenes were played, and I understood because it seemed parodic.<br/><br/>The actors seemed to have one or two facial expressions throughout the movie, monotone acting and just non-believable characters.<br/><br/>Made me wanna go home and watch cloverfield instead."
"rcolgan","6","1","2","19 May 2014"," Impressive effects and a cool monster, but not enough of them
","Once again Godzilla roars his way on to our screens, with a big epic path of destruction lying in his wake. Obviously after the failure of the 90's Godzilla, then the director Gareth Edwards had a lot to make up for. Unlike the 90's Godzilla, the film is far more loyal to the original films. For example, it's the military's mistakes that awake an ancient monster who has been dormant for years. As they awaken, mankind's only hope lies in Godzilla to protect them. In one of several nice callbacks in the film, Godzilla and the other monsters are influenced by the use of nuclear warfare, demonstrating the film does have respect for it's roots. <br/><br/>But obviously whilst the story remains like the original, the effects have improved vastly over the past 60 years. The monsters definitely look epic and just like the monkeys in Planet of the Apes, Godzilla has been brought to the modern age and gone from a guy in a suit to brilliant special effects. Obviously the effects go towards not only making the epic scale of monsters real, but also their vast destruction with the sight of entire buildings falling as we get to witness our monster pretty much obliterate entire cities. <br/><br/>Though, it has to be said the special effects alone are not the only thing that make this film impressive. Whilst the effects are probably the main selling point of the film, the director is not afraid to build up the monster over time, for a large part of the film showing glimpses of the monsters before their ultimate reveal. This is far more effective at emphasising the scale of the beasts in the film and also building up anticipation to get a full view of the monster. He also often shows the camera at the perspective of the citizens looking up at these monsters, placing us in the position of the victim of these attacks.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, just like Pacific Rim last year, a majority of the characters in the film feel either redundant or underdeveloped. For example, Brody's family are probably in the film for about 15 minutes and have little character and absolutely no impact on the plot other than being a reason for him to get home. They're an incredibly weak plot device and the film would have been much more successful had they simply been removed from the film to allow for more time towards stronger elements in the film. Similarly, Sally Hawkins character does nothing in the entire 2 hours of the film apart from possibly some exposition that could have easily been done by Ken Watanabe's character. Then there's the lead Brody, who is a very bland hero. This isn't due to the acting, but because we never learn anything about him as a character after the first 20 minutes of the film. It becomes harder to invest in the film because of this due to a lack of empathy towards the character and less tension when he is placed in danger. <br/><br/>It's also strange because they were effective at creating a great character in Bryan Cranston who would've been far better as the lead for the film, but instead gets barely any screen time overall. His character actually gets a lot of emotional investment in the first act of the film, becoming obsessed with finding out what had been hidden from him and becoming a crazed conspiracy theorist. But then the focus of the film shifts to his son who was less built up than Cranston was and didn't get any development over the rest of the film. It was also Cranston's great acting as well, being that great mixture of emotional agony and sheer awesomeness, making it a real shame we couldn't see more of him in the film. <br/><br/>There's also one other great character that the film has. Godzilla himself. Yes, finally instead of Hollywood treating him as some mindless monster, Godzilla has a personality! He's awesome with the best cheers in the cinema coming from his tail whips and atomic breath making him into one heck of a bad-ass. Along with this also comes his epic roar that remains as timeless now as it ever was. But Godzilla does have one disadvantage. Whilst the character of Godzilla dominates everything when he is on screen and has a very impressive build up, just like Cranston's character he doesn't get enough screen time with a feeling that there were some missed scenes of destruction in the film. <br/><br/>This can be said to partly being focused to build up suspense of character, but it's also because the film spends far too much time focused on the other monsters called the MUTO's. This is a shame, seeing as they are not particularly impressive and are fairly generic monsters that you can never really get particularly interested in. What I don't get is why not just use one of the many already existing monsters for the film like Mothra or King Ghidorah who would have made more interesting enemies? Though I guess we can hope to see them in the sequels. <br/><br/>Besides, Godzilla is still a good film. It's not as great as it could be, but still has some good elements such as the fights and the character of Godzilla. It's just a shame the film is let down by weaker elements such as spending too much time on characters who serve no purpose. But the film is certain to be a hit at the box office, largely due to the special effects and the name Godzilla which is something of an icon. Also I do feel that in some part the star power of Bryan Cranston will also play a role in it's box office glory due to his strong presence in the trailer and riding off his success from Breaking Bad."
"persibiz","5","1","2","19 May 2014"," Very atmospheric, but dull
","There are plenty of very atmospheric scenes in this movie doing a hard job to create a picture of modern-day apocalypse. The accident at nuclear power plant? Awesome. Jump through the clouds? Breathtaking. Rail road encounter? Intriguing enough to forget that you actually want all these dull characters to die, because the script is so bad that it makes you laugh every time someone says another stupid line with shocked or bitter face. There's absolutely no reason - and no excuse - for adding so many flat human characters: most of them don't even influence the story, making their presence nothing else but irritating. Fortunately the monsters are compelling enough to save the title; they seem not to care about other creatures in the move - and so should we."

","It's slow at first, but then Godzilla meets expectations with a huge roar spectacular visual effects , a design that wraps the dark production. I have two complaints - the obtuse argument is hard to follow and there is no impenetrable lack of seriousness and humor, which imparts a heaviness that could have been avoided . What happened to the old B- movie? Edwards teases out its work Ynos heroic worth waiting for Godzilla to fight the climactic battle with the monstrous enemy in the midst of a chaotic world devastated with skyscrapers shattered After the opening credits where the nuclear origin of the story follows the main characters are introduced along with inexplicable frequency patterns , tremors and a family tragedy.

Olsen has a charming presence with her big eyes and friendly personality . The tsunami devastated scene where Honolulu is effective and terror in Las Vegas , prompts laughter when we hear a recording of Elvis singing Devil in Disguise as Nevada is crumbling . But in the final act when the film comes into its own as the fire-breathing Godzilla and meet MUTO a formidable match. With his mega - budget , it is far from the original 1954 Japanese film and definitely a leap above 1998 Roland Emmerich version of Hollywood."
"ferguson-6","6","1","2","18 May 2014"," Our Hero?
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sixty years after Godzilla made his initial screen appearance, we get a full blown Hollywood special effects blockbuster version that will eclipse the $100 million mark in its first weekend. This is director Gareth Edwards second feature film (Monsters, 2010) and he juggles the modern day re-imagining with the Japanese roots and a hand full of other tributes throughout.<br/><br/>The cast seems impressive: Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins and David Strathairn. Unfortunately, most of these fine actors have little to do, and instead the dominant human presence (most every scene) is Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass) who somehow keeps getting gigs despite lacking even a dollop of screen presence or acting ability. Of course, this movie is supposed to belong to Godzilla, and even he is usurped on screen time by two nuclear-feasting praying mantis creatures that share some attributes with the classic Alien. These screen hogs are called MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are quite substantial ... crushing skyscrapers by landing.<br/><br/>The 1954 original film was an anti-nuclear statement, though the re-edited U.S. version replaced the political statement with Raymond Burr. Mr. Burr also appeared in the 1984 sequel which included a storyline of feeding off a nuclear plant (borrowed in this year's version). This film's prologue featuring Bryan Cranston working at a 1999 nuclear plant is an unmistakable nod to the recent Fukushima disaster, and sets the stage for the collision of science (Watanabe) and military (Strathairn). Director Edwards clearly enjoys his Jaws-like teasing of Godzilla, who finally shows up after almost an hour. And despite the Jurassic Park roar by our titular monster, this doesn't hold a candle to Spielberg's 1993 classic. We do get the quite familiar shots of bystanders running down the street, glancing back in fear - a must for any monster movie.<br/><br/>Having seen this one in 3D, I'll mention again that the enhanced effects offered by this technology do not offset the darkened, dulled look. Add that to the almost total lack of color - it's borderline Black and White - and there are simply too few breathtaking visual moments to consider this a monster classic."

","I don't mean dark as in figuratively but physically. I watched it on the Sky Movies website which compresses the hell out of films normally (and is generally awful) but since so much of the screen is black or near to black for most of the film the pixelation was terrible. Even without Sky's ridiculous compression the film is just so dark that I could barely make out half of what was going on without maxing out my screen's brightness, contrast and gamma settings to the point where explosions were blinding. It seems like the majority of the film is set at night which kind of makes the huge FX budget redundant. Black monsters fighting against a black sky backdrop in a black city with black planes firing black missiles at them. Then again half way into the film when I gave up Godzilla hadn't had more than about a minute of screen time anyway.<br/><br/>Then there was the audio. I had to have a finger hovering over the volume control for most of the film. Several times it goes from someone whispering to something exploding in a heartbeat which means you're either left straining to hear or blowing up your speakers. I'd have been better off watching it with subtitles (if Sky Movies wasn't such a dreadful website and actually had that option).<br/><br/>Eventually I had to give up watching it because it was like a simulation of being both blind and deaf. The plot didn't seem exactly engaging anyway but perhaps I'll give it another try when it comes to Netflix (a website that doesn't use stone age compression and streaming technology). Without having a nuclear powered monitor though I doubt I'll be able to make out much more. I'm not saying it's a bad film. I'm saying that it's more of a shouty black rectangle than it is a film.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Sky is a joke of a company."

(It's funny how the supposed sonograms didn't even show functions of time, but relations {to the mathematician}, being multi-valued per instant of time.) Suddenly, it's fifteen years later and we're in San Francisco. Some military jock (with a drop-dead gorgeous wife and two you-wanna-squeeze-them-to-death-adorable little boys) gets a call about his father having been arrested in Japan. It seems dad--the eccentric who hung around after the nuclear station was destroyed--likes to climb around old ruins and look for ""cover-ups"" and ""secret projects"" and such, although we are given ZERO CLUE what these cover-ups might cover or what secrets these secret projects might hold. Dad goes fishing for his collection of ZIP drives and, of course, police are Johnny-on-the-spot (in an abandoned city, where wood lice climb all over the place and feral dogs roam the streets in packs) to pick up Daddy-San and Sonny Boy. Oh, did I forget to mention, Dad is an expert in all things scientific, because (a) he lives in a what looks like Samuel T. Cogley's (of ST:TOS fame) library and (b) has books scattered here and there with impressive-to-the-layman titles on their spines such as ""Chemistry,"" ""Physics,"" and ""Echolocation."" (Funny, but I studied a great deal of both chemistry and physics, and I've yet to encounter a professional text named either of those.) Before long, Dad and son are transported under heavy guard to some secret site where some I'm-not-sure-what-it-is is being subjected to electric pulses but someone ""comes alive,"" putting out sonograms that ""look exactly like"" what was seen in the '50s and again in '99. Suddenly, after the order, ""kill it"" (excuse me, but, kill WHAT?), some goofy-looking creature that looks like it was borrowed from Cloverfield but suffered some shipping accidents en route appears, and we are confronted with blackouts and frenetic people running to and fro.<br/><br/>After a bit more pseudoscience and psychobabble, I lost my remaining patience and stalked out of the theater. Oh, well, it only cost me $1 at my community theater in my lovely south Florida retirement community . . ."

"pfang100","10","2","7","18 May 2014"," Great build-up to a great Godzilla movie.
","Overall I think the movie is well balanced and followed a great, slow burn build-up to a final battle. Some of the characters in the movie seemed not fleshed out. Most baffling for me is the character Dr. Ichiro, played by the famous Ken Watanabe. The character looked confused throughout the movie and I never fully understand why he was there other than just an adviser. My least favorable character was Vivienne Graham (played by Sally Hawkins). The character seemed marginal and no one will really miss her character if it was not in the movie. Aaron Johnson-Taylor's character was mediocre, and I only wish Brian Cranston could give him 20% more of his character's emotion in the movie.<br/><br/>The monsters animation was one of the best to grace the screen and I believe they did a great job on Godzilla. Glad now the official reviews are in and its favorable; therefore a sequel is in the plan. If done right, this reboot will create a good franchise for all the Godzilla fans.<br/><br/>All criticisms aside, I still give this move 10 out of 10, because I think this movie is good and deserves more sequels. There is just so much material we can build on this franchise. <br/><br/>Great job."

"benz2830","7","2","7","17 May 2014"," It is not really sure what it wants to be, but several good moments save the film as a whole
","I went into this film expecting to see a kaiju film that has the grittiness of recent superhero films like Nolan's Batman trilogy as well as realistic human drama. While the film does have bits and pieces of these elements, they do not blend well and the end result is a film with abrupt tonal shifts and without any clear focus. You can essentially divide the film into 3 parts: the first 30 minutes being packed with intense drama and well fleshed-out character backstory, the second being a filler without any clear direction, and the last focusing on cool epic monster fight. With that being said, the acting in the first part is exceptional. Bryan Cranston does a really great job portraying a scientist whose loss leads to self-destructing obsession. In fact, his acting is so realistic and intense that it sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to the rest of the cast. It is a disappointing to see the best actors-Cranston, Binoch, and Hawkins- in this movie being very underused (having less than 15 minutes of the screen time). Instead, the majority of human story is left to Aaron Taylor Johnson, who is not bad per se, but is nothing compared to the older cast. While a lot of people have complained about Godzilla not having enough fights, I don't find this an issue. One thing new audience do not understand about Godzilla is that he never has that much screen time even in the original Japanese versions. He would come out near the end, carry out the epic fight, and then go back into the ocean. This is a great formula because it makes each of Godzilla's appearances meaningful. Edwards' version closely follows this tradition. As a result, the final battle with MUTO (which happens to be the only fight the film shows to the audience, while the remaining minor battles are skipped) is downright awesome. In all, I personally think that if the non-Godzilla moments are done better and more fleshed out , this would be a great godzilla film."

","The fight scenes between Godzilla and the two MUTO's are brilliant and totally breathtaking and the CGI was amazing,there is nothing cheesy about these monsters, the MUYO's reminded me of the ""cloverfield monster"" & Bryan Cranston chews more scenery than the lizard..my biggest problem is that we didn't get to see nearly enough of him. The bulk of the 2-plus hour running time is leading up to a final showdown, and most of the shots we get are mere teases of the hulking lizard strutting around cities as he battles other monsters. Until the climax, ""Godzilla"" is an average movie that under-utilizes Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen, and stars a surprisingly wooden Aaron Taylor-Johnson. His character just doesn't show much emotion at all, and it echoes the slow pace of the film. The main thing keeping is interested is the hope that we'll eventually get to see Godzilla be himself, and when that does finally happenwow. WOW. It's an epic display of amazing effects and inventive fight staging that will no doubt have fans cheering in the theatre wanting more. And that's just itas great as the ending of ""Godzilla"" is, I just can't help but think that I wanted more.<br/><br/>Over all it's ""A good movie, just not the great one that fans of the mutant monster were hoping for"" I'll give it 7.5/10.."
"brennojohn1","7","2","7","16 May 2014"," Disappointing but still a good time
","***I highlight negatives rather than positives*** SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br/><br/>First and foremost then film was entertaining; it followed the Godzilla narrative, opened well and was not lacking in action. However the character development was poor and some concepts were silly. <br/><br/>There are 3 creatures and two sides, Godzilla on one and the mating pair on the other. The viewer is suppose to be in favour of Godzilla, this part i struggled with. I don't see how one threat is greater than the other, both sides just run rampant in the cities stomping on people and knocking over things. Okay, one side was reproducing but these things feed off radiation and they get most of their radiation from the earths core, hence why they burrow. My criticism is not to change the story, but spend more time or better techniques discerning the opposing sides. There was no where near enough differentiation to justify the dubbing of Godzilla as ""Savior"". Cringe cringe cringe.<br/><br/>Silly things: -When the soldiers visit the Nevada nuclear waste storage facility, they walk through a hallway and check the doors, one has been broken into. There is a massive hole on the side of the hill that would have been recognized before entry. -In the beginning they are at a mine site, they explore this cavern then find a tunnel where a creature has escaped and there is a long line of destruction indicating the path it took. The characters act surprised, like come on how didn't you already know about that... -Again in the mine site, there are hundreds of people just climbing ladders. Literally, not carrying anything just climbing ladders in and out of the pit. Im an engineer, this isn't how things work, painful to watch. I could create a longer list, but this applies to just about any movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, the character development was really disappointing. It introduces Bryan Cranston(Joe)and his family, he is a senior engineer working at a nuclear power plan in Japan.(Fast forward 15 years)He gets cut out of the story ~45min in, you are then passed on to his son a US soldier. You see bit of his family too, similar environment to his upbringing. I did not connect with any of the characters, i could not sympathise or hate them. This includes the creatures. Ultimately there is a very anticlimactic reunion between him and his family. Left with a feeling of ""huh, i guess its over"".<br/><br/>For me I need films where i can connect to the characters, I need to care about what happens to them. Get an insight into their personality, guess what their thinking etc. I know Godzilla isn't this kind of film and if it didn't have the cultural significance I would give it a 5/10."

I am so glad that I did not see this movie in the theaters and only wasted a Netflix viewing on it. I highly recommend that you do not waste your time watching this movie, because it would be a waste of time. The movie is called Godzilla and you almost never see him.

The Godzilla Story fails to deliver that joy and excitement, it fails to capture the attention of family audience, too many talk scenes and no action! Story is really crap to be honest, no logic. Two giant bugs looked like they came straight from Starship Troopers movie, Godzilla is actually hero here restoring order.

That's unfortunate in itself because the human story was absolutely lifeless and boring.<br/><br/>Second, I hated the fact that once again the producers took major liberties with the appearance of Godzilla. I thought the 1998 version was bad enough where they made him look more like a lizard. This one looks like they combined the head of a turtle or something with who knows what. It just doesn't work. I can't understand why producers continue to take classic icons like this and change them completely just to suit a new generation. It isn't necessary.<br/><br/>Third, after a long wait for the monsters, when you do finally see Godzilla and his nemesis, the majority of the action happens in pitch dark making it very difficult to see.<br/><br/>I saw this movie on DVD and I'm glad I waited because even the expense of the DVD was more than this film is worth.

If the movie industry is using IMDb user ratings to determine what people want to see, that explains why Hollywood is making so many awful movies nowadays. <br/><br/>I'm something of a military buff and a technogeek. The technical flaws in this movie are outstandingly BAD! They must have hired Dianne Feinstein as their technical director. Why did they put smoke flares on the boots of HALO jumpers? Why did they transport nuclear tipped MISSILES by train and boat instead of simply firing the MISSILES? Why did they haul the entire missile instead of just the warhead? Since when did Minuteman Missiles use mechanical detonators the size of a dorm room refrigerator? Military aircraft are shielded against electromagnetic pulses so they can operate near in a nuclear war zone. If a magnetic pulse was strong enough to knock out all of a fighter aircraft's electronics, its highly likely it would have knocked out the ejection seat electronics too! Yet pilots ejected from stricken aircraft.<br/><br/>There was nothing SPECIAL about this movie's special effects.

It is a cheesy Americanised plot about a marine torn from his family who is reunited with them at the end, oh and something about a giant lizard and a 'MUTO' fighting. It is pretty much a bad Cloverfield sequel.

"BinyaminB","6","2","8","17 May 2014"," A film more man than monster
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>An exciting return for Godzilla, which hopefully ushers in a new franchise for the king of monsters - the film plays out at a respectable pace, not too fast and not too slow. With the help of Cranston's riveting acting, the premise sets the scene for what you expect will be a great monster movie with an emotion-driven human element. With frequent teases of Godzilla traversing the seas for a good hour, it's Cranston's powerful display of tragedy that keeps the viewer interested in the human aspect. It's this performance that keeps you content with the film regardless of the fact that you've only been given tiny snippets of the huge beast. This tone sets the viewer up for huge optimism (at least it did me) when you know that surely Godzilla is going to make more frequent appearances in all his glory, and together with Cranston's brilliance you feel this is going to be a film more than just the king of beasts bashing heads but also a powerfully emotive picture of one human's search for truth and redemption.<br/><br/>However, that is unfortunately as far as it gets. The feeling of the film setting you up for such but not delivering. This is all ushered in by the death of Cranston's character roughly 40 minutes into the film. And taking the lead role is now Aaron Taylor Johnson who plays a military bomb expert and the son of Cranston's character. From the moment of Cranston's exit to Johnson's taking lead point you notice a shift from passion to passive. Johnson is unfortunately completely dull and boring. And suddenly in every sense I am reminded of the death of Nicholas Cage's character in Kick Ass leaving Johnson to pilot the rest of the film as lead character. I suddenly didn't care for the human element of the film anymore and was ready to see Godzilla kick some ass! But to my dismay the Godzilla tease continued on for another 40 minutes as Johnson continually gets caught in the fray of illogical coincidences despite his initial intention of returning home to his wife and child. All the while Watanabe serving purely as a plot device to explain the meaning and purpose of Godzilla. <br/><br/>Finally 80 minutes in and we get to see the king in action as he battles other monsters to claim his title as god of monsters. Unfortunately for the remaining 40 minutes of the movie, the battle scenes are way too short with only a couple of really kick ass moments for Godzilla and way too much of Johnson's dull acting (Can directors please stop giving this kid lead roles?!). Overall by the end of the film you don't get the feeling that you've seen Godzilla but rather military bomb man constantly stealing the spotlight. As a personal preference, I feel that Cranston should have survived (why kill off your best actor and the character you spent 20 minutes giving a backstory?) and he and Watanabe strive to defeat Godzilla using science but in the end Cranston is redeemed and moves on from his wife's death as he realises the folly of trying to defeat or control a force of nature (the analogy given to Godzilla by Watanabe). And as it was Godzilla rides off back into sea after defeating the other monsters. Or something along those lines at least!<br/><br/>As a whole, the film is set up strongly but falls incredibly flat with the death of Cranston's character, which as a consequence is not replaced by Godzilla leading the remainder of the film but the boring, uninteresting and sleep-inducing acting of Aaron Taylor Johnson."

"Troy_Campbell","6","2","8","15 May 2014"," A mixed bag of good and bad that ultimately lands somewhere in the middle.
","If ever a movie could be labelled a bag of liquorice allsorts, this is it. With nonsensical plot points, lifeless acting and a tone so earnest it makes Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy look like a Disney series, there's plenty to gripe about. Winning the directing gig solely on the back of his phenomenal debut film Monsters, Gareth Edwards appeared to be a rock solid choice for the job, but his approach is so heavy handed it all but drains the film of it's energy in the first hour. He also has a tendency to sideline logic or narrative cohesiveness – which is expected in a film that asks to be taken so seriously – in the name of crafting a visually splendid shot. Not helping is a ridiculously wooden central turn from Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is boring and unconvincing as the Navy EOD technician who inexplicably becomes the key to fighting the monsters. Also disappointing is the short shrift given to the extremely talented Elizabeth Olsen (see Martha Marcy May Marlene) with a one-dimensional role as Taylor-Johnson's wife and the overcooked performance from the otherwise amazing Bryan 'Breaking Bad' Cranston. Yet for all of its downfalls, when the final hour hits and Edwards lets loose with some cracking sequences all is almost forgiven. From a tense scene atop a railway bridge to a thrilling special ops HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jump and finally to the concluding beasty showdown in metropolitan Oakland, Edwards demonstrates just how memorable this picture could have been had he got it right from the opening credits instead of halfway through. Pacific Rim without the tongue-in-cheek vibe, Godzilla is at first a tough slog but finishes strong to place this squarely in the middle of the road."
"jordanqstrate","5","2","8","15 May 2014"," Godzilla was a disappointing but satisfying film
","After seeing all of the promotional videos and trailers for this movie me and my friends were as predicted pretty exited for this remake of this immortal classic monster film. After what seemed like endless months I finally got up and went and watched this movie on opening day. After exiting the movie I was absolutely disappointed about the outcome of this mega hyped film. The highlight of the film was Bryan Cranston and the cgi. After Bryan's half an hour cameo in my opinion the film declined into utter chaos. IT seemed like the makers had AD/HD constantly jumping from location to location it started to hurt my head after a while. After another hour of dull and boring acting by the main cast we get introduced to the two main antagonists... not Godzilla like I expected he becomes the anti-hero and eventually saves the day and wades back into the water whence he came. If the movie is named Godzilla I expect to see more than 30 minutes of the actual monster. Over all this movie was decent with its cgi and Bryan Cranston the movie was over all not at all what i expected. The city destruction rivals Man of Steel but ramped up 10 000 times. After this movie it solidifies that King Kong will always be my favourite movie monster of all time."
"junglebright","7","2","8","14 May 2014"," Weak story, iffy acting, but awesome action!
","All in all, Godzilla is not a bad movie. It is certainly entertaining. I consider it worth the price of an admission ticket.<br/><br/>The plot is not very strong, even though quite a significant portion of the film is dedicated to trying to create a story. For quite a while at the beginning, I was wondering why on earth we were focusing on titanic parasites rather than Godzilla; indeed, the entire movie seemed to be focused around them rather than on Godzilla.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing special, either.<br/><br/>However, this movie does not really need to have a good story or great acting in order to rock- it is about monsters and destruction, after all! The anticipation and excitement is nearly unbearable as the viewer watches and wonders when they'll get their first look at Godzilla, and what will happen when Godzilla finally clashes with this completely irrelevant enemy.<br/><br/>And boy, when you finally do see Godzilla, it will take your breath away. The CGI in this film is absolutely stunning; the monsters are more expressive and better actors than the humans. From the first moment I saw Godzilla I was quite literally trembling in my boots, and that lasted until half an hour after the movie was over.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are both epic and beautiful, and the sound of this film will both pulverize and awe you.<br/><br/>In short: Godzilla is an exquisitely-composed piece with tasteful action and terror, but a weak story and poor acting."

","Would have been better if it was on the radio. They didn't need to spend a lot on special effects, as half the movie was in the dark and you couldn't see anything. If you don't want to see anything every time the creatures are on screen, this is the movie for you. Couldn't even tell what happened to the creatures( I think Godzilla killed them), or what happened that Godzilla was seemingly dead at the end(not!!!). Did not seem to have a plot either. The people responsible for making this movie should be banned from ever making movies again.

","The trailer made me think this is a movie half-between Cloverfield and King Kong pushed to the limits to meet the known giant, the king of Monsters. The biggest creature ever in a movie.<br/><br/>Well... while Godzilla is incredibly amazing when HE is in action, it lacks something that Cloverfield had. That feeling of being afraid of being ripped in a second, no matter how much you're trying to escape. The suspense is lacking somehow except in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The scenes of people being in panic are close compared to Transformers 1, 2012 or World War Z. It's a replay of chaos in the streets that nowadays gets a bit un- touching.<br/><br/>The scenario? The ""Clichés"" are there. So if you dislike the American blockbusters, don't take it bad.<br/><br/>Despite these negative feelings, Kudos to the FX team who made Godzilla proud of its name. When he is on the screen, you're blown up by the immensity of the GOD- like reptile being a fearless beast.<br/><br/>But the creature is not so present on the screen. Poor Godzilla, he will eventually get an award for the best supporting role in a movie that bears his name. 6/10"
"stjohnzack","6","2","9","16 May 2014"," See it in theaters if you are going to see it, otherwise, just miss it.
","Just got out of a pre-screening in Seattle and I'm not fact checking anything. Just going to review from memory.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was okay. I'd say see it in a theater because trying to watch the action (when there is any) on any smaller screen is pointless. Yes, the main reason to see Godzilla at all is because it looks great, sounds great, and needs to be seen at a large scale to enjoy your old, big, friendly-neighborhood Godzilla.<br/><br/>Now for the downside. Bryan Cranston dies within the first half of the movie (via falling?). I honestly believe that they only cast him in this movie for the sake of having another big name actor. Aaron Taylor Johnson does a decent enough good at pulling the human aspect of the film by himself, but I probably just think that because the other characters are forgettable. Ken Watanabe is just there to be the first to say ""Godzilla"" out loud (which received a round of applause from the audience) but otherwise is just there to look confused and tell David Strathairn (arbitrary military dude) to not nuke the monsters. Elizabeth Olsen is no more than a damsel in distress. Everyone else is just there to fill in the voids and move the plot along. I did enjoy seeing Sally Hawkins, since I liked Blue Jasmine, but, as I said, just there to move the plot along.<br/><br/>Now for the Godzilla and company. There are two enemies, the male and female Mota (not going to try to pluralize that). The male Mota flies and is small, while the female plows through various high population areas and is large (as you can image). As I said, the monsters look great...when you see them. I understand cutting back on the action as to make you wait in anticipation of the big fight, but most of that lead up just feels like blue ballsing and disappointment when the big fight scene finally comes. I'm not saying the big fight isn't cool and all and makes sense with the plot, but exactly what you expect to happen happens. Yes, there are points when you are actually concerned about whether Godzilla is going to live or not (though the editor makes this concern hard to place when the movie keeps cutting back to screaming and scared civilians). In the end, Godzilla remember he has laser beam powers and a giant, whipping tail and uses them to defeat the Mota(s?). The final attack on the female Mota was pretty awesome. I even liked the idea that the Mota were attracted to radiation and the military to lure the creatures around using nukes (though why they decide to bring the nuke to San Francisco is still beyond me)."

The giants move in slow-motion because as we all know, the bigger something gets, the slower it moves. The wife and son, among many others, serve zero purpose in the movie. The CGI may have been good, but you can barely tell because of how dark everything was.

","Godzilla (Gojira) wakes from his slumber to do battle with two over-sized insect-like monsters that have been causing trouble in Japan, and which are now headed for San Francisco.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that I am in the minority for liking Roland Emmerich's Godzilla (1998), but dammit, I find it entertaining despite all of its silliness. In contrast, Gareth Edward's Godzilla is one hell of a bore for most of its running time, with way to much of the two hours plus spent on dull drama, and the action scenes, when they happen, simply too dark to be enjoyable. This is probably the reason why this year's Kong: Skull Island was so devoid of a plot, comprising of endless action set-pieces occurring in broad daylight: the makers were trying extra hard to ensure that it came nowhere near to the abject dreariness of Edward's film.<br/><br/>When giant radioactive lizard and mighty ape finally meet up in Godzilla vs. Kong (scheduled for 2020), I sure hope that they take extra special care to get the balance of plot and action right: I don't think I can handle another monster-sized disappointment."
"jamesrupert2014","9","1","3","7 March 2017"," Great revisioning of classic Godzilla
","An admission: I love Godzilla films (and kaiju eiga in general), so my starting point with any Godzilla film is 'great' (Godzilla's Revenge being a sad exception). This one, the 30th Godzilla film (countijng Japanese and US versions) is extra-great. The plot is typical late-Showa ""Godzilla as hero"" era: evil monsters appear, puny men cannot stop them, Godzilla appears, things look dire as he struggles to defeat the new monster, he prevails, and he heads back out to sea. This film explains this behaviour as Godzilla being some kind of balancing force of nature (OK - he's been that before, as well as having been the spirit of Japanese war dead, or in simpler times, just a nice-guy monster). Wisely, the film cuts back on the actual monster wrestling scenes (always kind of goofy) and focuses on the collateral destruction (the Golden Gate Bridge gets trashed again - if you need to escape monsters or aliens in San Francisco, definitely take the Bay Bridge). There are a few plot holes (mostly around the monsters' plot-selective predilection for radiation sources). The incidentals (story- line, script, acting etc.) are fine but, as always are secondary to the main attraction, which is excellent. The big guy lighting up his radioactive breath is a highlight and, although I kinda miss the quaint 'suitmation' of the classics, the flexibility allowed by CGI shows in the evil monster design ('evil' being subjective in this context, mostly they were just some guy wanting to score and a girl looking to settle down and have some kids, mostly). Turn down the fore-brain, turn up the hind-brain, and enjoy."
"spikenard222","7","1","3","14 May 2016"," Just wanted more, that's all
","Reading some of the reviews, you would think this was the worst movie ever made. Exactly what expectations did people have of a Godzilla movie anyway? Contrary to some, I thought the story line was interesting enough: they give the background of the monsters, and I found the characters and acting good enough to create some tension and interest. And they don't just throw the monsters at you in the first twenty minutes - they build up to the reveal gradually and with good pace, and what you think you are going to see at first isn't what you see (nice move there, movie makers, you got me). <br/><br/>My only complaint is that the filmmakers didn't do enough with the setup and foundation that they laid. They do spend a little too much time watching the monsters walk and fly around. The acting is wooden sometimes because the human characters aren't given enough to do, and some of their missions are kind of moot in the end. But hey, ultimately you came to see the monster, right? And as the film progressed, I got excited that I would get to see a real knock-down, drag-out monster fight. And I did!...sort of. The fight just doesn't go on long enough, for one thing. But worse, it is literally hard to see the fight. You often see the monsters from over someone's shoulder as they are running away, or out the window of some car, but rarely just a straight on camera view of Monster UFC. And the fight scenes are dark...literally dark with smoke and clouds. OK, I get it, if monsters tore up a city while venting themselves, that's probably what it would look like, but that makes for a poor cinematic viewing experience. BUT, Godzilla ultimately delivers the goods.<br/><br/>So, I thought the film would be horrible, given all that I had heard about it, but I found it an enjoyable popcorn film that just visually comes up a bit wanting. (Far better than that Star Wars: Farce Awakens debacle. That was gratuitous, I know.)"
"elitevaran","6","1","3","27 April 2016"," Mediocre
","Being a Godzilla fan a large portion of my life, i looked forward to this immensely. I thought to myself ""Godzilla is finally in good hands.."" But.. that is somewhat not true now. <br/><br/>The main issue of this film is how little they pay attention to Godzilla. How many scenes, you might wonder. Well he is on screen 8 minutes. And this is a two hour long movie. They didn't need to ""introduce"" him. He was well introduced for 60 years. In the trailers, they teased him. Which i can see, But they continue to tease him even in the film. Which is flat out ridiculous.<br/><br/>The enemy monster is brand new, freshly created. And this begins with the films second issue. They spend a HUGE majority of the movie talking about these things. We all came to see Godzilla, not MUTO'S vs Godzilla.<br/><br/>The film would have worked 80% percent better if it was JUST Godzilla. And if it actually fitted the dark and cold atmosphere of the Trailers. Which the Trailers displayed a dark and depressing tone, which should of been the entire film on its own. That would work perfect.. and it would might of been Oscar winning.<br/><br/>On the bright side, The times when Godzilla does show up, Its amazing. This Godzilla is the biggest one yet (stands at 108 meters). And is spectacular to see in theaters.<br/><br/>Godzilla has his atomic breath, too. Thank god.<br/><br/>The only good actor in the film is Bryan Cranston. You really feel the pain he is going through and he expresses his emotions in such a realistic way. Everybody else's acting is lacking.<br/><br/>The last flaw i have is Godzilla's nature. He ends up in this film to be the ""balance of nature"" But Godzilla should be the enemy. Having Godzilla a hero is just awkward. Sure he has saved Japan a number of times, But here he is pure Hero.<br/><br/>quick recap:<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>-Godzilla lacks a massive amount of screen time<br/><br/>-Acting is bland<br/><br/>-Too much attention to the MUTO <br/><br/>-Godzilla is a pure Hero <br/><br/>-Constant teasing<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>-Godzilla looks better than ever <br/><br/>-He has his Atomic Breath <br/><br/>-Soundtrack is awesome<br/><br/>-Bryan Cranston <br/><br/>-Director has respect to original designs/films/concepts<br/><br/>Pretty much, this was a film worth seeing in theaters. Okay to some fans, but most critics won't like it. Hopefully the 2018 sequel with Mothra/Rodan/Ghidorah will be good because they are done ""introducing"" him."

","I just finally watched the new Godzilla, and I was disappointed in it. I never gave a 4 to any movie but this one. First off they showed him an hour in to the movie for a second. It was more of a disaster movie, then a monster movie. It started off with this kid who's family worked for a radiation building and his mom dies because of this company. They covered it up saying it was a earthquake. But really this company was hiding what looks like to me a gigantic winged Preying Mantis. Now fifteen years later he's a army bomb tech, Lt Brody and he has a family, and his father knows what's going on but they didn't want his help, and this Japanese guy knows Godzilla is good. Then the gigantic preying mantis escaped, what they didn't say or show how they captured it. But I'm guessing when his mom died they found a egg and they did tests. When the Preying Mantis escaped, it killed his father. Lt Brody wife is a nurse in California. I liked his character, he saved a little boy in Japan from a train that he was on. His son puts on a bus and Godzilla popped up again, the army shot at him. I'm amazed how many states they showed the preying mantis in Japan, Nevada and California. Then they introduced a female preying mantis. <br/><br/>The first half was boring to me. I think they shouldn't even called it Godzilla! I think they should of called it preying mantis. After the radiation preying mantis almost destroyed the whole states, Godzilla came to save the day, he breath fire at them, that was the best part. I was happy that Lt Brody and his family is safe at the end of the movie. I think they showed Godzilla three times, I wasn't counting. I was hoping, they would show more of Godzilla then the people and Lt. Brody. I would recommend it but don't get your hopes up."

My only complaint is that Godzilla, King of the Monsters is only in it for 20 minutes. A simple 20 minutes. If there are more Godzilla movies, please make Godzilla appear more. The new creatures Godzilla faces are called MUTO's. They look ugly as anything and what i think is a bit dumb is that the Male MUTO is Smaller than the Female MUTO that is as big as the Chrysler Building.

Oh and for those excited to see Bryan Cranston in the movie enjoy it while it lasts because he isn't in it long. Everything about this movie is the reason why I don't watch trailers anymore because there was as much action in the 2 minute trailer as there was until the last 10 min of the film.

","How do bring Godzilla to American audience, without going to Toho (Godzilla 2000) or Tristar (That Monster Movie from 1998)? You don't try to mimic, you do something original. Godzilla 2014 was one of those movies that most fans simply hated, but they're reasons were invalid. Everything they did in this film followed how Toho would have made it. In fact, I bet Toho's 2016 movie will have a similar thing that we did, but now everyone will love it because it's Toho. People don't want to admit we did a good job.<br/><br/>The film has good characters, but had any Godzilla movie had huge character development, nope!<br/><br/>Godzilla fights other monsters, but have we ever had an uninterrupted final fight? Nope<br/><br/>Have we had a Godzilla movie with small screen times? Yes, all of them!<br/><br/>OK, OK, they killed Byran Cranston, but that was because I think he didn't want to do more movies,? Or maybe they need motivation for his son? Either way, they had a good reason to do it? And yes, it angered me but I got over it. <br/><br/>The cutaways, there was only one cutaways that got me angry and that was Godzilla's first appearance. The other one towards the end was fine because right after that the final battle began. This one we don't get to see a battle. There was a simple solution Gareth Edwards couldn't done, give I'd a mini battle. All the Godzilla movies have a small fight before the final battle, so a quick snip maybe even just a few minutes long, it didn't have to be crazy. The reception of this movie would have a changed like that, I hope Godzilla 2 will have G fight Rodan, Ghidorah and Mothra on his own first, than all of them in the final battle. That would fix the problems.<br/><br/>Also has there even been a Godzilla film where is the center focus? NOT ONE! NOT EVEN THE Original! It's always the humans and/or the other monsters. The MUTOS get more screen time than Godzilla and that's normal.<br/><br/>Also, the most important thing, is that they got the most important part about Godzilla right. Yes he breathes fire, yes he's indestructible, yes he's this and that. Not of that matters unless you get his purpose right. They did. He is natures power to restore balance. Without that, he's just a monster. Every monster has to have a reason, and they got it right. They didn't in 1998 or 2008 or 2013 with any of the big monster movies. This one did.<br/><br/>The main problem Godzilla 2014 suffers is his audience. His audience has never seen another Godzilla movie besides the one from 2000, or maybe some saw none at all. It also had the unfortunate time of being release after Pacific Rim which gave no purpose to monsters besides making them look awesome. People were expecting that over Godzilla. that is what sad, I hope that Godzilla gets better years, he's already rising to fame. New video game this year, TOHOS film next year and a sequel in 2018<br/><br/>Godzilla, I believe you will get appreciated again.<br/><br/>GodIlla 2014 is dam good movie, a excellent monster movie and a spectacular Godzilla movie"

","To start off with this film, I would like to say that the special effects are absolutely stunning. That is the only real great thing about such a movie. From watching the trailer I had such high expectations, but I was let down. This movie has a budget of $160 million. They put most of that into the special effects and not into the acting, story, etc. The only actor worth mentioning for another great performance but rather brief is from one of the best actors of today, Bryan Cranston. This film is awful and I would not go out of my way to watch it again.

","If I were to judge the monster movie or just the human story (though I'd have to divide the first part, more like an intro to the movie and the rest of the ""human"" sob-story - pun intended) it would get two different ratings. Now the old Godzilla movies might not have cared too much about the humans themselves it was more about the monster. And in a way the movie pay tribute to that. Actually, anything involving the ""monsters"" is done with the utmost respect to the history of the ""franchise"" (not sure if that's what they'd call it in Japan, but let's stick with that, why don't we).<br/><br/>But when it comes to the human story, especially anything absent Bryan Cranston (who does ramp it up a bit, but never truly fails to convey and convince in his role) and maybe our Japanese go-to guy (though he does have some lines that might make you cringe), the rest is absolute nonsense ... and not in a good way. Too many clichés, too many lightweight and not fleshed out characters, that kind of take the wind out of the movie. Fortunately not entirely, because you can rely on the action and CG to ramp it up a notch.<br/><br/>For some it's a case of too little too late, when it comes to the actual ""star"" of the movie, but I liked it just the way it was.

I LOVED Godzilla as a kid, but NOT because it was a story-telling masterpiece that was thought and emotion provoking. I liked it because a giant lizard destroyed cities and sometimes fought a big moth that for some reason felt a particular rage towards the island of Japan. If you're looking for more than that then this is not a movie for you.<br/><br/>Would more fight scenes have been cool? Of course. Could about 30-40 minutes have been shaved off? Probably. Was it a coherent, logical plot? Of course not. If you actually tried to follow the story would u have been left missing the movie for what it really is? Absolutely.<br/><br/>It wasn't awful and it certainly wasn't ""good"" by any means....consistent with every film ever based on Godzilla."

","In my head I was CONSTANTLY thinking of Jaegers and Kaijus from Pacific Rim... Cmon, where's Gypsy Danger at? BLOW THIS .... UP<br/><br/>To anyone who at least knows the previous Godzilla, it was just that one berserk lizard roaming around, and the government has to killer her, similar to Cloverfield, without the amateur recording with a shoe. Godzilla is more than just ""blowing up a rampant, giant monster"", but I will not explain why that is, as that would ruin your excitement firsthand if not already spoiled. There is a small plot twist that makes the movie more clear for people trying to understand what has happened.<br/><br/>This movie actually has a main character, who is a Lieutenant... He doesn't have a giant megazord or robot to battle Godzilla, he doesn't heat-ray vision or super-strength. His father has just studied Godzilla and any related events after her first appearance, and that is the only reason why this soldier is important. Otherwise, he is just any other soldier who must survive to get back to his family. Then again, I don't really know how well you can focus on an average person with a plot like this if he isn't really important to begin after the story unravels anyway.<br/><br/>If you're into giant monsters and Michael Bay Bewms, then watch this modern version of Godzilla"
"royalef","7","1","3","2 September 2014"," Moving in the right direction
","This movie was actually made by someone who understood why someone of us enjoyed these movies as kids. This is a popcorn flick above all else. So logic is thin. There are all sorts of little messes.<br/><br/>The plot could definitely been improved. A crater of a former nuclear power plant is holding a giant cocoon for 15 years and no one notices. Right there, reality snaps. BUt this *IS* a movie about giant radioactive monsters, right? So are we really expecting real world logic to last long? WHen father yells out for his son being hit, when his son can't be seen and is in a covered and locked truck which he never saw before, you think, wow,talk about bad editing and continuity. There are more. The army stops all vehicles on a bridge, stranding them, then you hear, ""don't fire there are civilians on the bridge,"" well yeah, you trapped them there then rolled a tank onto the bridge because a bridge is a great offensive line to a creature that is longer than the bridge itself.<br/><br/>The main characters are somewhat uninteresting. They try and put them all in harm's way, but really it is all very orchestrated and false feeling.<br/><br/>So why do I like this.<br/><br/>Because Godzilla was the good monster. Granted, Godzilla probably needed a little more screen time. He wasn't just destroying things like a dinosaur running wild. I loved the description of G as an alpha predator, a force of nature.<br/><br/>And he was given a cool looking monster to fight against. I really liked the MUTOS. They were like atomic gnats. People loved those old movies because they loved the monsters. Recreating the outdated monsters of the 60s will not work. The monster need to be monsters that people would find cool today. I wish they didn't feel the need to drag the fight to the U.S. to make it ""interesting"" to Americans.<br/><br/>This is what the old movies were about. ""Let them fight."" It is exactly what the audience wants. They got those elements right this time. Hopefully the sequel will invest in better plots and characters."
"Jacobmaycry","7","1","3","28 August 2014"," Let them fight! Just without the humans... Please...
","Let me start with apologizing for I will be comparing this new entry with the 1998 Godzilla. I know! They are two very different movies but I'm 21 so Godzilla has been a big piece of my childhood. Therefore I have my expectations.<br/><br/>So now that's that: This years entry is probably the best Godzilla movie I've seen hands down! Although I do have my share of complaints, which I will get to later. 2014 Godzilla gets the most important aspect RIGHT. And that's, well... GODZILLA. This isn't some 1998 re-imagining, which is basically a giant dinosaur just bumping into buildings and eating fish. This is classic Godzilla. The ultimate king (or God) of all monsters. The Godzilla who actually has character. The Godzilla who isn't afraid of any creature whether it be a giant monstrous butterfly or (my personal favorite) a giant flying robotic space turtle! and of course the Godzilla who is truly brutal and terrifying, because he doesn't act like just some giant dumb reptile, I mean you can tell he has a conscious which only makes him more dangerous. <br/><br/>They were so spot on with Godzilla. Unfortunately though, the movie is quickly thrown off balance do to a paper thin plot and uninteresting characters. I personally like Aaron Taylor- Johnson, I always felt like he's only a few paces away of joining the list of the highly talented modern day actors. So when I found out he was the primary protagonist for the new Godzilla, I was STOKED. And I thought for sure this would give him the recognition he deserves but unfortunately, even he himself fell flat with this feature. As for all the other supporting characters, you can just forget about them, because your going to end up up doing so naturally. The only actual GOOD STAND OUT characters in this film is Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) and Dr. Ishiro (Ken Watanabe). Even then, your not going to see much of them because the camera tends to focus mostly on Ford Brody (our boy Johnson) since this is primarily his story.<br/><br/>The story is always four steps behind this character as we watch him travel from china to New York to try and be with his family after being caught in the midst of monster uprising moving globally around the world. If the story doesn't sound interesting it's because it really isn't. The only times it will catch your attention is when it actually includes Godzilla. That was the biggest problem, too often it strayed away from everyone's favorite iconic monster to try and tell this bland story with bland characters. In honesty, there's not even a reason for these characters to be in the movie AT ALL. Simply because they just don't make an impact on the anything that's going on in the monster pandemic. Ford is simply just THERE, always acting as a witness even though the movie try's to portray him as the hero of the day. I just really wished to see a better story coming from the human area. Or at least manage to have more depth to those characters. This is why I couldn't help but to like the 1998 version a tad bit more when it came to this aspect simply because they did a great job balancing out characters, story, drama, and the great monster action. And I was simply led to basically believe this movie would conquer that objective just as well. <br/><br/>Than at times, the the structure of movie just feels off, making you ask questions. In the entire US military is Ford seriously the only explosive expert? Why attack the monsters in a particular way if you have already learned 2 times before hand that it doesn't work? All the story structure problems just simply feels like a desperate attempt to keep Ford on fire and in middle of the action. Which is the problem with focusing in on one character in the entire movie!!! As appose to having multiple characters who all bring in a different take in each scenario, like the 1998 film. Like I said earlier, don't even mind the side characters because they are just pushed too far out of sight, it's too easy to forget they are in the movie. Not even the high rolling actors/actresses can make up for the practically invisible roles, and really it's just a waste of great talent. <br/><br/>But fortunately! The movie is still not a disaster. The visual effects are jaw dropping, the fights are tense. And there were many complaints thrown around about how Godzilla had little screen time. While that could have helped distract audience more from the weak story and straight from the line characters, it built a lot of suspense making every fight we do see even more worth while and a real treat. Especially at the final score where everything just comes together for a real adrenaline rush, and even the story gets better at that point!<br/><br/>So what do we have? The plot is a bit too simple for a movie about such a complex creature(s). Good characters are something to be desired, and I don't even blame it on the acting I just believe it's poor character builds. But visually it's fun and does justice for everyone's favorite little monster.<br/><br/>Despite many of its problems. I walked away satisfied a pumped with pure excitement! Only wanting to see a sequel to be announced. There's quite a few things that could have been done better. But the 2014 reboot still gets a lot of things right. For that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone ESPECIALLY a real Godzilla fan! So if you're craving a great monster action movie, watch this ASAP! If your a fan who wants to see Godzilla, just be sure to watch it with someone more calm to hold your popcorn for you. You kids enjoy now!"

","Obviously the people that give this show bad ratings have never watched the old Godzilla movies.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie adds a modern twist to Godzilla but still stays true to most of it's origins. Godzilla has always been about the battles between large monsters and against man, with Godzilla usually coming out the reigning king. I think it was well written, however I believe they went a bit over board with building character report and did not spend enough time on monster scenes. They also didn't introduce Godzilla in the movie until later than I would have liked. This was a more dramatically written movie than the one with Matthew Broderick. It didn't seem to have much humor, but it didn't really seem to need it either. I have always been a Godzilla fan, and appreciate the contexts from which the story has grown. This movie was done well and I know I will enjoy watching it again in the future."

","Review is a bit late because I never got a chance to see it on the big screen but I want to give my opinion anyway. <br/><br/>First of let me start by saying that Godzilla is not a bad movie but, its not a great one either, depends on how you look at it. The movie blows out of the water any other Hollywood Godzilla movie and that is great but it has some problems:<br/><br/>Lead character is pretty stale and boring.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston delivers a great emotional performance but has very little screen time. Compared to him everyone else was cliché and average.<br/><br/>From trailers I expected a much darker movie and more tension but it failed to deliver in my opinion. This is mainly due to Bryan Cranston being in all promos/teasers but then dies in anticlimactic way 30 minutes into the film. Without him movie lost tension and emotional depth.<br/><br/>The good stuff: I liked this ""Cloverfieldish"" approach to the movie. Where you are teased trough the movie expecting the big battle, and focusing on the human part of the movie. But if you are going to do that you need strong leads. Both character and actor. CGI was great, and the mood of the movie was grandiose. With some breathtaking scenes. Too bad there was not much tension, that would change the movie a lot.<br/><br/>Godzilla was great. In his prime and full power with roar he looked like a real alpha predator. BUT the final battle was kind of underwhelming. Yes the CGI looked great but battle animations of the monsters were kind of ""meh"". Maybe its just me but it could have been better.<br/><br/>First time Godzilla showed up in full scale and was like: ""I am the alpha predator here"" I got goosebumps and I don't remember the last time I got goosebumps in a monster movie.<br/><br/>Overall Godzilla movie is a good monster movie. It had memorable moments which is important for the first movie. Some breathtaking scenes with grandiose scenery. It is dragged down by false marketing, stale lead human characters and stupid military plans. It failed to deliver darkness, mystery and tension."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","6","1","3","20 August 2014"," Massive terrestrials battle big across the world
","Going into Godzilla the expectation level is ""I hope it doesn't suck."" Because, statistically speaking, it has a high probability for suck-age: <br/><br/>A universe where a monstrous prehistoric reptile destroys a city is pretty far-fetched. Coupled with creating believable circumstances for its existence and a fairly realistic looking but conceptually modern monster is a challenge.<br/><br/>In the 2014 version of Godzilla, Godzilla is a monster well known and researched by the government but kept secret from mankind. It exists cloaked in the water, dormant from destruction. That is, until other massive unidentified terrestrial organisms (MUTO) threaten civilization and the only way to save the world is pitting MUTO against Godzilla.<br/><br/>Scientist Joe Brody, played by Bryan Cranston, and his son Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson are caught in the middle of the combat in Japan while Ford's wife Elle, Elizabeth Olsen, and their son try to survive the devastation created by the MUTO in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche are not nearly as prevalent in the film as the trailer allows you to believe. The trailer is an old bait and switch, which at some level acknowledges and admits that the movie can not hold its own and needs to capitalize on some star-power. Olsen and Johnson do their job but aren't compelling enough to keep you engaged.<br/><br/>All in all, the premise is a little thin and you don't really care about the characters. Godzilla wants to feel like a monster match-up to rival all other adversary crossover battles. The problem? The MUTO is new and you don't really get why Godzilla is the only one who can take them down. Ken Watanabe says it has something to do with the light and the dark, the balance, or some kind of dubious explanation.<br/><br/>As a movie it isn't great and there are better summer blockbusters to keep you entertained. As a Godzilla film it is a lot of fun. Watanabe says ""Got-zirra"" a few times; there are a lot of action scenes with military battle scenes at several iconic locations and the Godzilla monster looks super cool.

"DonaldDooD","6","1","3","26 July 2014"," Still One of The Best Godzilla Films
","Seeing the original trailers for the film, I was convinced it was going to be the best movie this year. They emphasized not on the colossal action of Godzilla vs other monsters, but on the pure devastation such a creature would leave in its wake. Like the 1954 one, but using the latest technology to fully enhance its vision.<br/><br/>Sadly, we got a monster vs monster film. Not a bad one, necessarily. But instead of the scourge of humanity, Godzilla's our uncontrollable hero. I'd preferred a darker Godzilla film, to bring some fresh air to Hollywood blockbusters and the franchise.<br/><br/>Some people complain about the pacing of the film. On paper, I think it's done perfectly. There's a lot of buildup, yet things are always happening. The damage by these creatures is devastating, yet controlled enough so you aren't desensitized. Some shots are done very well, truly emphasizing the creatures' titanic size. The CGI blows the costumed men out of the water, and even does a good job on the destruction. The final battle is climactic, and earned cheers in our theater.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the characters are pretty weak. Godzilla films aren't know for their personalities, but by this era, we should have some relateable characters. I literally cannot say a single defining trait about our main character. He's just a typical, handsome action lead who isn't even particularly handsome. More is known about the surface of Mars than his relationship between his wife and kid. They're obviously included as a cheap attempt to pull heartstrings. Bryan Cranston's and Ken Watanabe's characters are better, but ultimately have too little time and too little depth. The weakness of the characters makes the Jaws-esq pacing a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>I still had a good time. The ending fight scene was totally worth it, and the action and destruction beforehand impressed me. It should have been better, though. Hopefully the sequel will correct its problems and tread new ground while pleasing fans."

Byran Cranston was the greatest Performance ever then Aaron Taylor Johnson no Performance for that guy i say he was just boring no acting his acting is not very series in movie he's acting is more like kick ass Byran Cranston was a fan of Godzilla he has been fan of Godzilla in His Childhood but why could Byran could been Main Role if he was main it could been better like Breaking Bad. it was always hes favorite monster movie That f**king pisses me off how they killed off the best actor within the first 30 minutes! I always liked Bryan Cranston as an actor because of Breaking Bad, Drive but i know this is clichéd but after Breaking Bad he became one of my favorite actors because he can make you sympathize, fear and laugh with a character and he is always believable in every role no matter how shitty a movie is! he is usually the best part. f**k why couldn't he have been the lead! oh here's why because hes a 58 year old man not a 22 year old straight out of the CW actor. well that's bull crap! when did men stop being the leads in movies and boys became it! f**k if i was a movie director which i really want to be and i had Bryan Cranston in my cast i would make him the f**king lead because he has the most talent. F**king hell give the older guys a chance instead of these untalented CW/Abercrombe runway model types! ﻿<br/><br/>there is good shots in movie when Aaron Jumps off the plane with the red flares flying around jumping down wow Godzilla there is good CGI but to much, This movie was awesome, this ending was funny too. But people complaining about it so much were expecting the whole movie to be literally nothing but action and a bunch of cgi. Most people don't even know what they want in movies anymore. But this movie stayed true to the old Godzilla movies, and the other monsters being on screen more than Godzilla has happened plenty of times in movies like Godzilla vs Destroy. The build up for Godzilla is what made it so epic, and the atomic breath really made the movie there is less Godzilla just more Characters not really slow burn but there is not many great characters i enjoy this movie but i give it 6/10 it could done better because it is 2 hour movie 5 or 7 minutes Godzilla was in it he less in it he needs to be more in movie Main Role wasn't great or good just lame it would better if Byran Cranston as main role it doesn't matter if he is old or not old give it shot they could got Josh Brolin or Aaron Paul it doesn't matter if character is got to be 22 year old it is the performance of acting Aaron Taylor is more Comedy not in Series movies he didn't suit in role very well Byran Cranston will suit better for main role this movie needs more Godzilla"

","Godzilla(2014) was a surprise for me-a pleasant one,if nothing else. I do not usually go in for monster movies as I felt they all had the same basic formula- the world isn't ready for the monster, it comes out of nowhere, terrorizes a city or two,etc. But Gareth Edwards took that formula and changed it and made it his own,for the better,I think. The special effects are amazing and when Godzilla made his grand entrance it took my breath away. It also helped that I saw The King of the Monsters in all his glory, in 3D.(Trust me,it's worth it.)<br/><br/>This new reboot certainly has it's flaws,however, with an underwhelming performance from Aaron Taylor Johnson,and a misused performance from the phenomenal Bryan Cranston.I also felt that this version did not show enough of the big green guy, and focused too much on characters whose names you probably won't remember after coming out of the theatre. <br/><br/>But Godzilla (2014) is quite an enjoyable summer blockbuster that puts it's own spin on the monster movie formula.<br/><br/>7/10"

Fifteen years later, when the same patterns recur, Ford Brody returns to the plant to seek answers, only to discover the authorities are keeping a terrible secret ...<br/><br/>I love old monster movies and Toho Studios' classic Gojira is one of my favourites. This new blockbuster version is a terrific modern-day retelling but with a cool old-fashioned sensibility; heroic good guys, non-stop action, terrific story, family friendly, serious but fun entertainment. Even better, it doesn't make the mistake so many blockbusters do and play dumb - the drama and the tragedy are played straight, without detracting from the epic or crazy aspects of the story. Edwards creates moments of horror, tension, spectacle and relief within the fantasy context, reminiscent of Spielberg's early work, with a keen eye for atmosphere. He also brings out the themes exceptionally well - the tragic disaster scenes have real bite and recall the all too recent catastrophes of the Indonesian Tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown. Dr Serizawa (Watanabe) sums it up perfectly when he says, ""The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in their control, and not the other way around."". Godzilla has always been a metaphor for natural justice and the movie exploits it to the hilt, all the while bombarding us with dogfights, nuclear bombs, tidal waves, helicopters, exploding trains, mass panic, not forgetting of course the super-scary Mutos (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). Technically it's equally fabulous, with great photography by Irish cameraman Seamus McGarvey, superb visual effects by Jim Rygiel and wonderful sound effects by Erik Aadahl - if ever there's a film to see (or rather hear) in a cinema, it's this; only a full-on sound system can do justice to Godzilla's roar. Best of all is the stomping, menacing score by Alexandre DeSplat, which rampages along with the story and leaves us gasping with intensity just as much as the visuals - there's an amazing, almost ethereal sequence, where Ford parachutes into the smoking hell of San Francisco to the eerie chorale from Gyorgy Ligeti's Requiem which is like nothing I've ever seen before. The cast are good, particularly Watanabe (Tampopo, The Last Samurai), Cranston and Strathairn; youthful beefcake lead Taylor-Johnson does well too but flounders occasionally at the scale of events. The movie is not without some flaws - the last half-hour particularly is needlessly dark and dingy, and the script takes a few lurches in continuity which could have been smoothed out. These quibbles aside, this is a cracking great monster flick, beautifully crafted, with thrills aplenty, a perfect movie for a ten-year-old boy or anyone (like me) who has never really grown up much beyond that. Hail to the King Of The Monsters."

","1st watched 5/31/2014 – 8 out of 10(Dir-Gareth Edwards): Amazing adventure monster movie where the main attraction is the monsters and the humans are just along for the ride. I'm not saying the movie doesn't have a good human story that keeps you interested – it does, but we understand who's in control when the movie is over and I think that was the original intention of the Godzilla legend when it was created in 1956. This 2014 version is visually almost perfect and has a storyline that keeps you interested with a twist making Godzilla not necessarily the enemy of mankind. Early in the movie some other monsters are discovered hatching in a couple of areas of the world being disguised as seismic activity, and they start feeding off the energy sources around them. Some of the Japanese folk are aware of Godzilla's existence and these occurrences happening before – so they are called in for assistance. An American who used to work for a company that originally discovered the first monster believes this 2nd occurrence is a cover-up and him and his son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, become involved. Godzilla is then awakened basically because these creatures can upset the order of nature including destroying mankind but also being higher on the food chain then the before mentioned Godly, King of the Monsters. The creators of this film, with Director Gareth Edwards, have now re-awakened the classic monster movie and upgraded it for this generation not necessarily because of the special effects, but because of the great storytelling. The monsters are not really that unique conceptually for this age(I even wondered if Godzilla was partially played by a man in a suit like some of the early films but don't believe it was), but a lot of care was taken in making the story unique and quick-paced. I don't believe those connected with the genre will be disappointed and neither will newbies.

","Pros: Epic, well-paced fight scenes; Moments of suspense; Fantastic scale of setting; GODZILLA!!!<br/><br/>Cons: All of the human characters except Dr. Serizawa; Some stilted dialogue<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Gareth Evans' take on the Godzilla franchise seems to strike a chord with fans of Stephen Spielberg, sometimes a little too much so. This movie shouldn't be called ""Godzilla"" so much as it should be called ""Godzilla meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Independence Day"", but it does do the eponymous king of the monsters some justice. A few of the rest of us may cry foul, but his die-hard subjects are sure to applaud his continued undisputed rule."
"Halorz","6","1","3","2 June 2014"," Godzilla! Doesn't Quite Get There...
","First of all let me say I am a huge fan of Godzilla! Always was and always will be. When I heard about the stellar cast involved like Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche and most of all Bryan Cranston, I was excited. Actors at the pinnacle of their performing powers. <br/><br/>Godzilla started of so well. Full of interesting characters, plot points and the premise was very good. However what let this movie down was killing of the best actor in the film too early... Bryan Cranston. Just when you begin to understand and feel for the character, they go and kill him off! Aaron Paul Johnson is a good actor and improving but in my view he was not ready to take control and lead this huge blockbuster film. <br/><br/>At some points I lost interest. Towards the end it felt like it was dragging on. I just wanted Godzilla to fight it out already. It took a good while for Godzilla and his enemy to be introduced which I didn't mind. I loved the way the movie tried to focus on character development rather than unnecessary all out cgi action but again if you kill off the best actors than what are you left with?...<br/><br/>The good things about Godzilla are the effects were really good. The beginning was thrilling. The performances were believable. <br/><br/>Overall it was a good popcorn flick, good action but it is not the film I will watch again. Didn't leave a lasting impression unfortunately but glad they tried to reboot it and hey... at least it's better than the last Godzilla film. :)"
"TanoPagme","5","1","3","2 June 2014"," Big budget effects do not a blockbuster story make
","When I went into the theater to see this film, I was already worried. People had already been making comments before the release about how it would be so much better than the '98 version Roland Emmerich made. To which I reply... Were you guys doped or something when you wrote that stuff? Sure the new Gojira looked awesome, but you only got to see all of him during the fight in Frisco, and even then it was mostly snippets of him punching or tail-whacking the monster bugs - he should've had a full-body shot by the time he'd gotten to Hawaii, in my opinion. Also, if the father died because of the military's idiotic attempts to cover things up, shouldn't the son be angry with them over it? I think there's a lot more they could've done, which either for reasons unfathomable to me, they didn't attempt - Me personally, I would've loved to see the son give the big lizard an angry talking to to get him motivated again after he got knocked out by the big bugs, but then he probably wouldn't have understood him anyways. All in all, I'm thinking this new Godzilla doesn't have any reason to say its any better than the 98 Godzilla, because I don't think they give you a real glimpse into the big guy's true soul - all you get is a much of monsters smacking each other around while humans run around like ants trying not to get squished."
"fullheadofsteam","5","1","3","1 June 2014"," Ignore the Ratings above 5 stars and those below 5 stars!
","5 stars out of 10 is the fairest rating this movie should be given. Here's why: Godzilla the ""monster"" is magnificent -- great CG and Godzilla has more character than any of the actors. The physical swimming and fighting scenes with Godzilla are spectacular. That rates by itself at least 9 stars, but everything else in this movie rates no more than 1 star. The talent of the best actors in this movie is totally wasted: Juliette Binoche dies early in the movie, and Alan Cranston soon after. Ken Wantanabe is a token Japanese, and his skinny female sidekick is...worthless -- no roles were fully fleshed out or very well written, and the lead actor is wooden and one-dimensional, portraying a Navy explosives expert who miraculously is a lone survivor of absolutely every skirmish he's involved in, and is not only given a perfectly fitting Army uniform but Army firearms as well simply because he meets up with the Army, and suddenly becomes a trained paratrooper capable of sky-diving from 30,000 feet and landing perfectly in a clear area of a physically demolished San Francisco. Should I next mention the molded plastic monsters that Godzilla fights, one of which flies and one of which, the intended mate, cannot? Or the female's egg sack that no one shoots? Or, once the egg sacs are laid, a rip-off from the movie ""Aliens"" takes place? And the ending of this movie could not be any more contrived and hokey. Please, people who ripped the previous Godzilla flick with Matthew Broderick have no business rating this movie any higher. If you want to see a truly original, modern take on the idea of the original Godzilla, but with engaging human characters, then stick with ""Cloverfield""."
"info-11400","7","1","3","1 June 2014"," Godzilla is back
","This American Godzilla is true to its heritage. They added Hollywood budget, changed the location but kept the spirit. <br/><br/>There are some who complain about the story. A Godzilla movie and a logical script? Sure, one would definitely expect that. Main characters and psychological depth? Absolutely necessary? <br/><br/>The story is - of course - full of plot holes big enough to let Godzilla pass. The human characters are more or less one dimensional. But what do you expect. This is a silly monster movie. <br/><br/>And it is really fantastic in showing the thread. For example the bridge scene, where one gets a good idea of the helplessness of man. <br/><br/>And the film excels in showing the size of what is happening. In the last year's I have seen a lot of movies depicting the destruction of cities on a fabulous technical level. Transforers, Man of Steel, just to name a few. <br/><br/>But never I felt the sheer size as in Godzilla. The scene where he gets on land for the first time is a masterpiece in this sense. He doesn't simply leave the sea, oh no. He evokes a tsunami first before wrecking a whole city.<br/><br/>And as in most Toho films Godzilla is the good guy, sort of. While human efforts are futile he saves the world from monstrous muto. The director proved in ""monsters "" that he can bring alien ecosystems to life and create an eerie atmosphere. He succeeds with the muto. However they look too much like Cloverfield and too little like Japanese Toho monsters. <br/><br/>The human storyline fortunately doesn't interfere too much with the action. Still I would have liked to see more of Godzilla. <br/><br/>A good Godzilla movie and a must for.fans."
"FilmAlicia","6","1","3","1 June 2014"," Best Godzilla movie I've seen, so-so movie
","SPOILERY Review ahead: As a child in the 60's, I watched my share of Japanese monster movies, including the Americanized version of ""Godzilla"" with Raymond Burr, and sequels pitting ""Godzilla"" or his ilk (remember ""Gammera"" the flying, spinning, jet-propelled tortoise?) against other monsters. I must admit, I am not a fan of the genre except as mild amusement, as most ""Godzilla"" movies I've seen are in the ""so bad they are funny"" category. <br/><br/>Gareth Edwards' summer blockbuster shows his fondness for the ""Godzilla"" genre, and it also shows that he has learned a great deal from watching Spielberg films.<br/><br/>While not quite as entertaining as ""Jurassic Park,"" or ""Close Encounters,"" ""Godzilla,"" is still a good deal less dumb than most Japanese monster movies I've seen, and the pacing is good.<br/><br/>But, the movie contains huge improbabilities, especially the fortuitous way that the hero, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor Johnson) manages to be everywhere that the monsters are throughout the movie, from Japan, to Hawaii, to somewhere in the American West between Las Vegas and San Francisco, to San Francisco itself. <br/><br/>And, because I belong to that demographic of middle-aged women who think Bryan Cranston is one of the best American actors working today, I was disappointed that he is only in the movie's first act, and then only for about 10 minutes, in spite of previews that make his role seem much larger.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor Johnson, who plays Cranston's son, is the movie's hero, and he's a likable but bland presence. The monster showdown isn't bad, and it's much better that Godzilla is fighting other monsters instead of just stomping on buildings, cars, and people. But, I felt the filmmakers didn't get the correct mix between the human story and the blockbuster elements. The human story felt like it was about 10% of the movie when it should have been 25 or 30%. Godzilla is no monster movie classic, it's no ""King Kong"" or ""Jurassic Park."" But, for a ""Godzilla"" movie, you could do a lot worse."
"gorilazed","7","1","3","28 May 2014"," Expected some more
","I haven't been to the movies often due to work but because of it's extremely appealing trailer I made an effort and decided to go watch this film although, plot wise, I would probably have preferred the new X-MEN or Edge of Tomorrow. I expected Godzilla to focus itself mostly on action and CGI.<br/><br/>CONTAINS SPOILERS The opening credits are a montage of Monarch documents and 1950s videos. This immediately brought to mind the 1998 Godzilla which kind of started the same way. But fear not, this Godzilla is nothing like the one from 1998.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston steals the first part of the show. His performance is amazing however he's not in the movie much. And the same can be said for Godzilla, and this is the big problem of the film. We actually only get to ""really"" see the King of Monsters in the last 20 min of the movie.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the characters from this story have absolutely no development. After that intro scene during 1999, one would expect that some of the plot would revolve around the relationship between Ford(Taylor Johnson) and his father(Cranston). But that doesn't happen. The same goes with Ford's new family. Elle (Olsen) has absolutely no importance to this story whatsoever. Overall, this movie had a lot of capable actors but doesn't make the most of them. Juliette Binoche dies right in the beginning; Elizabeth Olsen just runs from everything; Ken Watanabe's scenes only required for him to be kept in awe during most of the time; Aaron Taylor-Johnson was just required to act cool which he already looks by nature; Cranston the only one from which acting was really required died too early.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is very appealing to the eye with beautiful CGI (those blue flames are so cool) and awesome fighting scenes between the beasts. But the whole film was really just a huge build up for the final fight scene between the monsters which makes it a little boring during that time, having no character development and all."
"RockoutGlockout117","7","1","3","28 May 2014"," A Mixed Bag Of Awesome And Average
","Let me start this off by saying, I'm a huge Sci-Fi guy, when I heard a few years ago that they were releasing a new Godzilla after the Ten Year gap in the series, I was overjoyed and had spasms of happiness uncontrollably. I have very fond memories of growing up watching the original Toho films, with Rubber Suit Godzilla, his shaking spikes, and his interesting grasp of martial arts, however as silly as those films were I loved them as a kid and would watch them on repeat. There was a sense of awe and greatness when the world(or at least Japan) seemed on the brink of destruction only to have the big G come kick all the assorted monsters asses.<br/><br/>So I had high expectations for this film, that being said those other movies, as noted previously were made with rubber suits and miniatures, certainly a well looked upon director with 160 Million bucks could make quite a Godzilla film right? Well the answer is interestingly in the middle. The movie most definitely has its share of awesome moments, notable Godzilla's first full appearance almost an hour in, and his fleeting few minutes of fighting towards the end these moments truly capture what makes Godzilla great, but you see that's the problem Godzilla is only in the movie for like 20 minutes, and only like 5-7 of those minutes is he actually doing things we want to see. Now I totally understand the idea of holding something of till close to the end, and then having it Burst out in sheer epic style, the Star Wars movies with there Light Saber fights handle this well, now imagine if there was a Star Wars light Saber fight, built up to the entire film, and when it finally happened the two fought for like 30 seconds and then one epically beheaded or chopped the other in half, sure it'd be cool, it'd be fun, but it wouldn't have the power of Luke's fight with Vader in return of the jedi, or Obi-Wan and Anakin on Mustafar in Revenge Of The Sith, your left with what is more or less a cool opening fight, great for the beginning but a bit disappointing if that were the end.That is essentially the Achilles heal of this Godzilla the film holds everything back until the last possible moment, and then when we get it, its not as good as we were hoping it'd be, its awesome sure, its pretty cool, I have to admit I even had a bit of a spasm when a certain BLUE something made an appearance. And the various finishing moves were badass and very big G, but that doesn't quite account for having to wait 2 hours to see them.<br/><br/>For the majority of this film we what is essentially your typical disaster film with folks running around trying not to get stepped on buildings being destroyed and all that, and the military trying to nuke the creatures just as you'd expect. I think my biggest complaint is the amount of shots of the other creatures who Godzilla fights, wondering through cities causing mass destruction, WHY ARE WE SEEING THESE? Couldn't this have been communicated via news report? Like they did with Godzilla's first actual fight turning it into a punchline? Couldn't we have saved the budget for more Monster fighting? If I had gotten a solid Ten Minutes of Godzilla punching these tag teaming monsters in the face and then finishing them off, I would've probably given this thing a 9 or 10. But the movie doesn't give us that, it wants to make us comfortable with just enough to get by, and that was something I never felt like was happening in the old films. I'm not saying every movie has to be ""Man Of Steel"" with 45 minutes of it devoted to things getting blown to shi* but it would be at least nice to feel like one got what they payed for in spades, instead of maybe the film just barely passing the ""Alright"" line.<br/><br/>In summary Godzilla is an enjoyable if flawed film, and if you like the old films you'll probably enjoy this just for the little greatness it does have, that being said, lets hope the announced Godzilla 2 and 3 have a lot more monster fighting. GODZILLA FOREVER!"

","This film should be a blockbuster.<br/><br/>With the advancement of computer animation and the refinement of the special effect/make up skill, no sci-fi tales would be too far or too complicated to present on screen.<br/><br/>Godzilla was an old film originated from japan. The Japanese at the time could only utilize man-in-monster-custom and lots of small scale sized city model to do film making, together with their traditional value in respecting nature and haunted by the shadow of atomic bombing in WWII. the result of those films were terrible; poor plot , slow progress, loose ends. The whole sequel stopped for about 10 years and Hollywood have tried to take over with the older one in 1998 but ending up in a comedy film. BUT THIS TIME , THINGS ARE DIFFERENT ! This time ,the Hollywood is much more prepared after making a series of disaster genre films. They got a much firmer grasp in the feeling of the people in the zone. The presentation was much more realistic. The plot of the film is well designed , merge up flawlessly. The producer knew truly about what film he/she is making and he/she did a great job in making a disaster movie, a disaster caused by 3 radioactive monsters. The monsters are now real monsters compared with the old one who could hear the cheering up of the citizen, the fight is brutal, devastating and full of collateral damage. They were assigned with their own purpose and they ""acted"" very well compared with their predecessor. I am waiting to watch Godzilla 2 in the coming future if possible."
"TheLonelyPillow","7","1","3","25 May 2014"," Godzilla is a good movie, but it suffers from a lack of action.
","I've seen Godzilla twice now, and I have to say that its a pretty good movie. Lets start with the things I liked. I really liked the CGI in this movie. The monsters looked excellent, and its honestly the best CGI I have ever seen. I also liked the fighting scene near the end, especially Godzilla's final kill, it was awesome! I also liked the cinematography in this movie. It was excellent! I found Bryan Cranston to be really good, and the other actors to be alright. The plot was good too, but nothing special. Now here is what I didn't like, and its honestly my only complaint. There weren't many action scenes. I was a little disappointed upon leaving the theater because I wanted to see the monsters fight more than once. They fight about three times in the movie, but we only see the final one. Had there been more fighting scenes I would have probably given this move an eight or nine out of ten. So if you are a casual movie goer, you can probably wait to see this on demand, or on Netflix, but if you are a Godzilla fan like me, watching it in a theater is the way to go, just know that the lack of action in this movie might disappoint you."
"noprisoners66","7","1","3","25 May 2014"," Just my humble opinion
","My wife and I decided to check this out last night and we enjoyed it a lot. It is definitely very well made and not a cheesy movie. That was a big plus. Godzilla himself is awesome! It took awhile before he appeared at the expense of more military/warfare-state glorification that did not, IMHO, add to the storyline but, he is awesome when he does appear! <br/><br/>This military/warfare-state glorification was a part of the reason I dinged the film somewhat in my rating. The other reason is that Brian Cranston's character was killed off too early and his characters son then became the lead human character and I don't believe this young actor was leading-man material for this film.<br/><br/>I did like the fact that the dialogue did not rely on any comedic elements and I don't recall any cursing/swearing or more than one gratuitous sex scene. I will watch it again. <br/><br/>Did I mention Godzilla was awesome?!"
"Anurag-Shetty","7","1","3","25 May 2014"," No significant story to speak of but, entertaining nevertheless.
","Godzilla is a reboot of the 1954 Japanese Godzilla movie. Ford Brody(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a bomb disarming expert, living a domesticated life in San Francisco, with his wife, Elle Brody(Elizabeth Olsen) & son, Sam Brody(Carson Bolde). After a tragedy occurred in his childhood, Ford's dad, Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston), just can't let go of the past & still believes that whatever happened was not a natural disaster. Meanwhile, after a horrific accident the MUTO(Massive Unknown Terrestrial Organism) monsters are born. This also makes way for Godzilla, an ancient radioactive monster, who faces off against the MUTOs. Now, it is up to the US army which includes Ford, to stop the three monsters from wreaking havoc and destroying the human race. <br/><br/>Godzilla is an extremely entertaining movie from start to finish. The special effects are outstanding & the face off between Godzilla & the MUTOs is worth the ticket price alone. Godzilla and the other creatures look menacing. The 3D is effective. However, in the midst of all this there is no coherent story to speak of. Sure, there is a basic plot. However, with so many talented actors in the mix, they could have made Godzilla an emotionally engaging movie, apart from it being a monster movie. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is great as Ford Brody. Ken Watanabe is impressive as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. Bryan Cranston is outstanding as Joe Brody. Cranston was barely given any screen time. I really wish he had a bigger role. Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant as Elle Brody. Carson Bolde is adorable as Sam Brody. Sally Hawkins is effective as Vivienne Graham. Juliette Binoche is amazing as Sandra Brody. Last but not the least, David Strathairn is spectacular as Admiral William Stenz. Godzilla is not a must watch. However, watch it for some monstrous entertainment!"
"SpaceRain","7","1","3","24 May 2014"," 5% disappointing, 95% awesome
","Granted this was my most anticipated movie this year. I honestly didn't mind the amount of screen time Godzilla had, sure they had opportunities to show him more (and earlier on) but I still think he was in it as much as he needed to be. <br/><br/>What did slightly disappoint me was that it got a little slow in the middle before the big monster showdown began and they seemed to show the other monsters more than they showed Godzilla, which is pretty ironic considering the title. But once the brawl went down that immediately went away for me. <br/><br/>Another thing, I know the human characters don't matter much in a Godzilla movie but they could've been much more engaging. I hate to say this but I just couldn't connect to Aaron Johnson's character at all...as the lead actor he should've shown far more emotion especially considering a lot of the dramatic stuff that happens to him and his family. <br/><br/>This disappointed me the most (Spoiler alert): <br/><br/>I know that looks like a lot for it to be just 5% disappointing but the movie itself almost completely made up for its flaws. The monster fights and moves are actually very creative, and I was a huge Godzilla fan ever since I was a kid so I've seen a lot of these. They never fail to surprise. <br/><br/>It was a brilliant idea to make Godzilla into an art-house-style disaster movie, at least the way I saw it. It didn't have pointless mayhem or monsters always slamming into each other so they could get entangled and indistinguishable. This movie takes its time, and when G finally shows up you don't even mind it that he arrives so late. I literally wanted to cheer in my theater in his fight scenes and every time he roared...brought me chills every time. <br/><br/>At least this time they show more of the disaster from the perspective of the citizens experiencing it, unlike almost every Roland Emmerich/Michael Bay disaster movie. They could learn a ton from Edwards' approach."

SO many actors , all a bit scattered. then the focus goes round and round with the military which end up looking a bit disorganized and somewhat inefficient and then we are to focus on the quiet , emotionally scared son of our resident loony scientist who is suppose to be sort of our hero figure but doesn't really make that work because well he's just a bit too how do we say ""stiff"". Godzilla should always be the real focus and he almost gets lost here . You want to watch , the last half hour 45 mins are the best.

"sean-devitt","6","1","3","24 May 2014"," A forty minute movie with padding
","I gave this a 6 out of 10 because the effects were great and Bryan Cranston gave a decent performance that kept me interested.<br/><br/>In the end it looked like they made a good forty minute movie and then thought ""Oh no, this movie needs to be at least 2 hours, what can we do to pad it out?"" As others have pointed out the movie goes downhill after Cranston's character ends up in a body bag after 30 odd minutes. The moment they zipped him up I felt that any chances the movie had of being great got zipped up with him.<br/><br/>The military characters were a complete waste of screen time. Perhaps they were there because the armed forces gave some assistance to the production of the movie. Maybe the military sponsored parts of it to boost recruitment or maybe they needed to pad things out before they reveal Godzilla. I have no idea what they thought they were doing but every time the movie cut to the soldiers I felt the movie deflate. I don't wish to single out actors but Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character was so flat it almost killed the movie stone dead. I am not sure what was wrong but something was definitely missing there. Maybe he was told to play it flat in contrast to Cranston who played his father but I think that I may be giving him too much credit.<br/><br/>You could almost tell where the studio executives stepped in and messed with the movie. ""Hey, we need a wife and kid, the dog has to escape and the 'lead' character has to save another kid (to show he cares and he is a good father figure). Delete the scene with Akira Takarada (no one knows who he is anyway) and show Elizabeth Olsen working in a hospital (she is a caring female character so please care about her)). Don't spend time with the monsters show a halo jump that leads to nothing. Don't show the monsters but have a ticking clock on a nuke that goes nowhere. Hire Ken Watanabe and have him do nothing too"" The movie was very frustrating. They had fantastic special effects and could have showcased Godzilla as never before but they simply teased the audience and wasted a golden opportunity because of the Hollywood desire to push family values, pets and the American military."

","Readers beware, MAJOR SPOILERS.<br/><br/>So, I went to watch Godzilla some days ago and what I expected was not what I saw. First of all, let me tell you that the trailer was really misleading and Bryan Cranston who I wanted to see more didn't even get 20 minutes of screen time. Also, Watanabe is someone else that I like and he didn't appear for more than 20 minutes either with little to no scenario.<br/><br/>But that should be great because Godzilla is about Godzilla fighting other monsters that feed on radiation and kick ass right? Wrong. The rest of the movie should have been like that but it was not. Seriously, they sent the Monsters to the US and showed the American army taking over the case to fight the monsters and such, failing at every level since Godzilla did everything in the end, but still were there. For 1 hour all you saw were stupid plans that you knew wouldn't work, the forgettable main actor that did nothing but watch and the two MUTOs along with Godzilla trying to reach their destination. Of course, near the end, we got what we wanted with Godzilla literally destroying the female and male MUTOs only to be acknowledged as a hero and go back to the sea for sleeping after his goal of natural balance is finished. <br/><br/>I would give this movie an 8 at best since I didn't really dislike it but I really hated the way they tried showing American nationalism and how the Americans kick ass or tried to kick ass. Just like the Transformers movies.<br/><br/>Other than that, if you want to see Bryan Cranston, don't watch it. If you want to see Ken Watanabe, don't watch it. If you want to see Godzilla being awesome for more than 40 minutes, don't watch it. If you hate Japan and believe that having this Godzilla movie take part in the U.S. will make it great and you want to see 'Murica, go ahead and watch it.<br/><br/>The overall movie was OK but no more than just OK. Forgettable and useless characters where the monsters were cameos in their own movies. Too bad that no sequel with match the original Godzilla. That would be because the original came out for a reason at that time and not just for money."

They really should have kept Bryan Cranston as the main character; this would have been a much better received film if they had done that (then kept Aaron T-J as a supporting character). Also, I would say there definitely could have been more Godzilla featured (and I'm hoping for an extended cut with more of the big guy), but in all fairness, it means that when you do see him you're literally thinking ""HOLY F***"". Lastly, I will say the ending was a little too happy and uplifting if I'm totally honest. It takes away from Godzilla being the huge terrifying monster.<br/><br/>Right, good points: Firstly, while it takes a little while for him to finally show up (a little under an hour if I remember right), it's rather incredible when he finally does. The big reveal with the tsunami is just phenomenal, and possibly the best scene in the film. It teases him throughout, then finally pans up to reveal him and you get that iconic roar, and it just...wow! There's another few sequences with the MUTOs (specifically the train bridge scene) which also really make you feel like you're right there. Finally, the last 30 minutes or so is exactly what you'd want. While it's not over the top, it is an awesome spectacle to see and plays out incredibly (the HALO jump sequence is just spectacular).<br/><br/>To round off, I'd say if you're looking for a deep, thought provoking story, look elsewhere. While this is a more intelligent flick than Pacific Rim (and certainly more grounded in reality). It's the spectacle the really pays off. Don't get too caught up with the frustration of waiting for Godzilla to show up, it's a slow burner, just sit back and enjoy the build up and it'll pay off magnificently."

","I'll get straight to the complaint I've heard most about this new reboot of ""Godzilla""...that complaint is ""he's not in it enough"" and maybe so. For the first hour or so he isn't on screen. The story takes the spotlight about a father who lost his wife in an apparent accident and his son who's been trying his best to forget about it. But the father, played by Bryan Cranston insists it wasn't an accident. He believes something else happened and has spent the last 15 years of his life trying to figure it out.<br/><br/>Anyway, I personally enjoyed the fact that this wasn't your typical monster movie where the monster or monsters wreak havoc on earth and everyone runs and screams, buildings and monuments are destroyed and so on. Here, it was almost as if the camera was angled so that we see these monsters from the an actual human's point of view. And lets face it, if something like this would be actually happening in the real world people would be running for their lives. Sure, there would be pictures and videos but how many people would really risk their lives for a video or picture.<br/><br/>When we finally get our final battle between Godzilla and the 2 two ""MUTO's"", you won't be disappointed. It's a fantastic final fight between them and you end up rooting for Godzilla to come out on top. This might not be to everyone's liking, but for me it hit the spot. A solid 7/10 for me."

","19 May 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Godzilla. I went to see this with an open mind. Historically these films have been pretty bad but it's kind of expected. Tonight I went purely to see how the modern CGI dealt with the old old story of the big scary dinosaur, and it wasn't bad, once you finally got there. This film was so slow getting going, it was almost an hour into the action before there was any kind of action. I know films need to provide back stories and build you up to the main juicy content but this was painful to behold, and I found myself fidgeting in my seat just to stay awake.......however......once the plot took and the main guts of the film got underway the action wasn't half bad. Godzilla himself was quite a personable character and even the bad guys had a moment of tenderness. It's always fun to see a place you know trashed in a disaster film and boy did they trash San Francisco. No real chance for actors to shine is this movie but the CGI boys did good!!!"
"sanjidparvez","8","1","3","19 May 2014"," For His Glimpse Only...
","THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!!! The story centered more around on the MUTO monsters than the big G and though it deliberately tried to follow JAWS steps regarding building up the anticipation & but as a whole couldn't able to become as masterclass of modern celluloid art like the way JAWS (1975) succeeded & become such classic. They were excessively too conscious about showing off the King. And needless to say, the weak character development with a wrong choice of/on lead. It was frustrating to see Bryan Cranston's character's such early departure from the story, he should have take the lead on confronting the monsters or they should have give that lead to a more mature young actor. A.T-Johnson as Ford Brody looked totally blunt throughout the film. CGI was top notch but it was kinda failed to provide any sort of ""3D feel"" at most of the part. BUT...after of this drawbacks, still I can't say I didn't enjoy Gareth Edwards' GODZILLA. Probably my love for this monster & huge anticipation about this movie were the reasons but I must admit it did satisfied me on many level. Though at times looked kinda mechanical but MUTOs are now amazing new additions to the franchise, looking forward to see them more in coming sequels along side with other legendary friends & foes of Godzilla. And about Godzilla...all I can say is...HAIL TO THE KING! Loved & cherished each & every moment he appeared on the screen & even in the 'TV' news broadcasting sequence! Though the director's JAWS-theory of showing less & building the anticipation for the final pay-off at the end weren't up to the mark but still it kinda worked 'finely' overall & glad he at least put an effort for it which is appreciating from a new filmmaker these days. I'll definitely won't mind to spend excessively higher ticket price for Godzilla again & even to see more of his actions (with freaking astonishing atomic Breath!) in whatever the sequels they're going to make in the future. Perhaps as I was so desperately waiting for a Godzilla movie & my excitement to see him once again after all these years was so on top of my expectation level that I'm now happily ready to forgive & overlook all those negative aspects of this movie. So at the end, it was indeed a visually stunning & satisfying experience for me as a Godzilla fan."
"siddsen95","7","1","3","19 May 2014"," Rewards patient viewers with a ROARING climax.
","Let's start off by saying that I, a part-time kaiju lover, was excited for this movie. Like reaaaallllyyy excited. Mr. Emmerich's 1998 MortalZilla was...disappointing. And, as such I had very high hopes for this one. Maybe a little too high. In all fairness, Gareth Edwards is still learning the ropes, so we can excuse him for not making a masterpiece.<br/><br/>So, is the much awaited film worth watching? <br/><br/>MOST DEFINITELY.<br/><br/>Now, let's hear why.<br/><br/>*warning* as this is my first review, inadvertent(minor) spoilers may follow. Sorry people*/warning*<br/><br/>The movie begins pretty much exactly the same way as the 1998 version, with Nuclear tests in Bikini Islands accompanying the opening credit sequences. But the little twist provided is....interesting.<br/><br/>Movie proper begins with introduction to Dr.Joe Brody(Bryan Cranston). A geo-analyst working for the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant, Japan. What follows is a tense sequence as some mysterious force causes earthquakes to erupt and the plant suffers a reactor meltdown.<br/><br/>If anything, the sequence only serves to show just how dark and embedded in realism the movie wants to be. Cranston, unsurprisingly, brings out the best in, what would normally be a bland character. To say his acting is convincing, his fears, relatable; would be a vary large understatement. <br/><br/>The next hour or so is dedicated to the events which happen in retrospect, following that one fatal day. The movie takes its time introducing, and bonding us to its other cast members. Aaron Taylor Johnson's character, Ford Brody(Joe's son), a US Marine and a bomb- disposal specialist and his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen). And rest assured, Johnson has really put up his best for this movie.<br/><br/>The pace is deliberately slow here, surreptitiously exposing the various conspiracies and cover-ups enacted by the Authorities to hide uncomfortable truth. As it is, such a slogging pace may disinterest some. Even after the first major monster fills the screen, it takes a good half-hour before we get to see the titular character in full form. <br/><br/>Again, the slackened pace is for the better. As it creates a palpable sense of dread, suspense and tension. Borenstien's clever screenplay mean you only get a few, sparse and dreadful glimpses of the King of Monsters, before a spectacular reveal. This makes Godzilla all the more of the frightful beast he ought to be.<br/><br/>Those(like me), who came for the monster fights...will have to wait till after the interval. After, the motivations of all those involved becomes known. The battles that follow surely rivals Pacific Rim's monster- cuffs. With destruction aplenty, ROARS and surround sound booms and bangs to get your heart racing.<br/><br/>About the sound. Its impressive. This may not be(technically speaking), a horror movie..but the sound design(The menacing monster grunts, accentuated during quite moments) certainly keeps you at the edge of your seat. Fantastic.<br/><br/>That's not to say the visuals aren't impressive as well. This is one movie, where the 3-D has been used well. There is nothing quite like gaping at the approaching bulk of the gigantic dorsal scales of Godzilla, as it powers through the sea. Also, as I said earlier, the climactic battle,(with the HALO jump sequence, you might have seen in the trailer) is truly 'see to believe'. Good news for longtime Gojira fans, the battle sequence features some very clever(and plentiful) references to their favorite films. Prepare to be Amazed!<br/><br/>So, where are the flaws, then? As great as the last 30 mins were, I can't help but feel that Edwards could have sped up the opening a little. Yes Cranston owns the scene's he is in, but, he makes every other non-Cranston, non-monster scene pale by comparison.So expect to be bored a little as the details take their time to emerge. Also, try as it might to be realistic, the film falls right into the cliché of the military making stupid decisions in the face of an unprecedented threat and ignoring the advice of the 'intelligent' specialist/scientist, Dr. Serizawa(Ken Watanabe).<br/><br/>Speaking of Ken Watanabe. I felt his character was merely a support role, dishing out story details and acting as the default exposition man. He has only one memorable line in the movie. He ought to have had a bigger role than the guy who knows where the monsters are going next. The same goes for plenty of other, top-billed cast members who have a very insignificant roles.<br/><br/>And, ardent fans/observant viewers will notice plenty of other inconsistencies. Really, they are forgivable. Scriptwriter, Dave Callaham wrote a pretty competent monster story. There's only so much realistic a goddamn monster movie can be. But flaws nonetheless...I'll spare you the details; plot holes will only matter to you, after you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>And that's all. No other bad news. [:-p]<br/><br/>Godzilla is described as an apex predator. A force of nature. An agent of Balance. The nail biting climactic sequence did nothing but reinforce those notions. What I experienced in the last half hour of the movie, raised my expectations of, and the standard of what monster/disaster movies should be capable of. And that more than made up for the sophomoric pace of the first hour. Congratulations, Mr. Edwards, for a job well done.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading...And go watch the damn movie already!"
"timbrunofelix","6","1","3","19 May 2014"," A Great Monster Movie
","To get straight to the point, the weak link of this movie is the script. The plot is mediocre, the characters one dimensional and it offers some heavy Hollywood clichés. The frightened wife who has nothing to do but worrying about her husband, kids in poorly constructed dangerous situations who get rescued (3 times in total), the dog who escapes from a tsunami, the army guy holding his bible praying before the battle and of course the happy ending where the protagonist and his wife falling into each others arms. So far so bad right?But aside from these scenes you get a really awesome movie and that is due to the great directing by Gareth Edwards. There is great cinematography, imagery, suspense, action, cgi and on top of that a really well done soundtrack which supports the mood of the movie perfectly. Even though the protagonists are not quite complex the actors make the best out of it and deliver some really convincing and touching scenes (Bryan Cranston!). And while Aaron Johnson is bland in comparison to Cranston he is likable and never annoys. He serves as the person through which eyes the audience encounters the monstrous events and because of the first 20 minutes of family build up we can also empathize with him. Summarized the human element in this movie varies from decent to sometimes great, but it never gets goofy or unreliable and that is completely sufficient for a monster movie. Cause when it comes to the main attraction, this movie really shines. The Buildup scenes for Godzilla are just absolutely well made and the fact of not seeing him that much, enriches this movie a lot. The increasing tension regarding Godzillas appearance culminates in an battle of unrivaled epicness. This scene alone is great by itself but gets even more exciting thanks to the well constructed buildup. Talking about goosebumps moments, well there are a lot of them. For example the first outburst of the muto, the bridge scene, the halo-jump or godzillas approach to Hawaii or San Francisco. All these scenes are so intense and atmospheric because of the superb shots which are done in interesting and authentic ways and don't give away to much, leaving room for imagination but simultaneously create a perfect sense for the scale of these creatures. In conclusion this movie has flaws but compensate these with great direction and its unique approach portraying giant creatures, which makes it in my opinion a great movie standing out from the usual Einheitsbrei (german word for mishmash)."
"rjvanderwerf","7","1","3","19 May 2014"," Do not expect Pacific Rim...
","Let me begin by saying that this film handled Godzilla with respect to the old films very well. Fans of Godzilla will be very happy. They handled the tone and development of the film fairly well. And of course Godzilla acted and looked as we all expected.<br/><br/>However, I think Pacific Rim has raised the bar in terms of what American audiences expect from a Kaiju film (or at least what I want). I want epic monster battles seasoned with interesting stories of people dealing with these apocalyptic scenarios. Pacific Rim gave us both of those. Godzilla came close...but didn't.<br/><br/>The monster battles were chopped up into tiny bits and strewn along the plot. The human stories were bland at best. The characters were one dimensional and the monsters we didn't care about had more screen time then the star of the film.<br/><br/>Pacific Rim has Hannibal Chow, and the two quirky doctors. Godzilla had a cliché family with a jar head who's only interesting detail was that he worked on bombs. The father played by Brian Cranston was the most interesting character and he's not in most of the film.<br/><br/>Knowing that this film was directed by the same guy who gave us 'Monsters' makes sense to me now. He applied the same formula for Monsters to Godzilla. And this resulted in a kind of tension building, hide and go seek with history's greatest monster. Which would have worked if only...if only they gave us MORE GODZILLA! The movie had too little Godzilla and too much boring actors and stupid other monsters. Now maybe I am tainted by Pacific Rim. But I really think this movie should have taken a few more notes from that film.<br/><br/>But people love Godzilla and don't want to talk bad about it in case they kill any hopes for a sequel. But announcements were made recently for a sequel..so thats good. However I fear the director and studio will only see the money (which I think most sales will be made because it's Godzilla and not on the inherent merits of the film itself) and not consider its flaws. I fear the sequel will repeat itself.<br/><br/>For the sequel...Please give us MORE Godzilla...or at the very least...more interesting human characters....Thank you."

","It's the first monster movie of the summer, and the main character's last name is Brody. Now it's not Jaw it's Godzilla. You remember Godzilla don't youa people in rubber monster suits, miniature city sets, and Asian people with lip-synced English. Remember? Remember those Monster fights that looked like they were choreographed by the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Remember? This film is nothing like that. While this film was more like Cloverfield to me, vesting most of the story to the human side, rather than spending lots of time showcasing creatures. I guess after spending. The weekend re-watching old Godzilla movies on one of the Cable movie channels, I was left kinda disappointed. While this movie isn't anything like the 1998 version and does paint Godzilla as the hero like he was an many of the movies, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't enough fight scenes. At least not like the old WWE Monster smack downs of the old Godzilla movies. And I'm drawing a blank..but what happened to the last bomb? All in All..it's an OK film..but I guess for now when I need a Godzilla fix, I'll stick to the campy ones of the 70's"
"maryyy-4-446840","7","1","3","19 May 2014"," Godzilla is the king.
","Godzilla had positives aspects for me, but matched against many negative aspects, actor Bryan Cranston once again had a spectacular performance, which in my opinion should have been this one of the reasons why his character was killed in a part in which the their participation would be crucial, the fact that he is being so spectacular was to downgrade further the provision of other actors who unfortunately even with the death of Joe Brody (Bryan Crasnston), the other characters haven't had some relevance. in technical terms moths like Godzilla were very well prepared, and the struggle between these three monsters was fantastic. In general, the film Godzilla has a great reputation to the king of all monsters, managed to raise my expectations."

","After I watched the original from 1954 I wanted to watch this one in the cinema. Such amazing CGI effects and fights between Godzilla and his enemies. I really enjoyed to see Bryan Cranston and the first appearance from Godzilla with his amazing roar. But I was sag that he died too early. The story was satisfying and not bad. I thought Godzilla would not use his beam but then you will be surprised. The movie feels more like an American Godzilla movie even tough the location is japan. I was really happy that Warner Bros. announced a sequel. The question is who is the next enemy of Godzilla? I think you'll enjoy Godzilla 2014 even if you are not a fan of Godzilla!"
"zubingarda","6","1","3","19 May 2014"," Good. Not Great
","I did not know what to expect.<br/><br/>Before watching the movie yesterday, I was constantly reading the reviews here which generally praised it to the skies. Did this really work? Was the last fight really worth gushing about? How did it feel? Read on...<br/><br/>Instead of preaching awesomeness or uselessness, I will provide some observations. These observations are by my standards so remember your mileage may vary. Let's go! <br/><br/>GOOD THINGS: <br/><br/>1. I am middle aged. I've seen LOTS of monster movies, and I mean LOTS! But NOTHING prepares you for the sheer SIZE of Godzilla. Think he's as big as the Empire State Building? Well, Think again! I could *NOT* believe I was actually WHISTLING and SHOUTING.<br/><br/>2. No other monster has ever made a grander entry! Godzilla's entry is preceded by a Tsunami, out of control winds and darkened skies! Mind Blowing! <br/><br/>3. When the monsters fight, damn they REALLY fight. This is not Japanese Godzilla where he uses Kung-Fu (if you think I'm joking, one Japanese Godzilla movie even had him doing a break dance!). Not so here. Fight of the Titans? Nope, the titans look positively diminutive here. And there is lots of clawing around (love it when the MUTO shoves it's claw up Godzilla's mouth and drags him around like a ragged doll!)<br/><br/>4. Atmosphere - When San Fransisco is transformed from city to a prehistoric rubble (with radioactive lightning and clouds!) the sight is a jaw-dropper.<br/><br/>5. Atomic Breath - Well, we've seen atomic breaths on Godzilla before, but not like THIS! See as his scales glow, and chest Balloons to incredible proportions, before he let's one loose! I feel sorry for the MUTOs.<br/><br/>6. A first in a monster movie. A real first! --- NO CRINGE WORTHY MOMENTS! NONE!! You do NOT go... aw... come on man, move on or find a room or 'what an idiotic kid'. Nope. Zilch. Nada! Nothing! <br/><br/>7. Another first in a monster movie. A real first! --- SUPER INTELLIGENT MILITARY!! Oh yes! From the Captain to the soldier to the Admiral! All of them super smart AND pragmatic! None of the 'destroy the monster!' nope. Fantastic idea to pull back and let them fight out each other. And instead, focus on evacuating the citizens. BRILLIANT! <br/><br/>8. And YET ANOTHER FIRST in a monster movie. A real first! --- No 'NEWBIE' SOLDIER, who points gun at Godzilla then sweats, then gets nervous and fires. Nope. EACH soldier has nerves of steel. REALISTIC portrayal.<br/><br/>So very good. Now here are the baddies: <br/><br/>1. You feel like you are playing DOOM and wish you can up the GAMMA a bit. Every fight, EVERY FIGHT is in darkness, doom and gloom. The Japanese versions of Godzilla are ridiculous, laughable and campy. But ALL of them have fights in broad daylight. here Godzilla and MUTOS fight and fight and fight... in the dark.<br/><br/>2. Think fighting in the dark is BAD enough? Well, in order to make a... ahem, realistic portrayal, there is a lot of dust that comes up when they knock over building during their Wrestling bouts. Dark. Can't see. AND DUSTY on top of that? Not *my* idea of a fight. Heck, even DARK KNIGHT had a climax during the day.<br/><br/>3. How does this sound? A movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger AND Sly Stallone? Hot? Awesome? Sure. Then you watch the movie. And wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... (all in the name of 'suspense' and 'build up' and 'character development et all)... and wait... and wait...and THEN....still wait.... before Godzilla shows up. You get the idea! <br/><br/>4. Also, in the same movie, how about having Arnold and Sly.... for a total of only 10 minutes? WHAT????!!!!!! Yes, the 2h 3m movie has ONLY 10 minutes of Godzilla time! that is if you include audio and rumbles. IF you want only the bad boy, sorry, that about 7 minutes in ALL! <br/><br/>5. Imagine watching a BATMAN movie. Not from Point of view of Batman, but of an outsider who sees batman and Joker fighting. THAT thing. So we have a movie about people, with Godzilla being incidental.<br/><br/>Overall, I came out... disappointed.<br/><br/>The fights were great. Godzilla Godly. But still, the impact of Godzilla's time, and the dark, cloudy ""heck if I do this, dumb cine goers will ooh and ah as they really won't be able to understand this trash"" fights were... well, like diluted.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's like sitting for a meal, getting a salad, glimpsing at the prime steak, smelling it, even cutting it to pieces with your knife --- but then pushing the plate back, knife, steak and all.<br/><br/>An excellent movie, that I found disappointing."
"cartoonscomics1","8","1","3","19 May 2014"," Good, but not gold
","Overall it is good, with absolutely awesome monsters batter scenes, the design of Godzilla is also nice apart from the elephant feet which make me question how Godzilla walk on two legs at times. There are quite a bit of logic flaws, but to not ruin the movie for those who like it, I won't say what they are. It is definitely worth watching in the cinema rather than on the TV, biggest reason and possibly the reason that make this a must watch in the cinema is the majestic roar that you are always ready for but never grew tired of. And the final kill, there is no better description then to call it BADASS! And to have those altered documents and the early credit scene done in the confidential documents style is just icing on the cake."
"brent_or","8","1","3","19 May 2014"," Fantastic Atmosphere, Breathtaking Scale, Serious Tone
","I am not generally a fan of Godzilla films. The sort of popcorn entertainment that most of them have been just does not appeal much to me. I went to see this film on a bit of a whim. And I do not regret it. I'll get to the point -- the monster(s) in this film are incredible in execution. Incredible.<br/><br/>This Godzilla has fantastic atmosphere. It's played very seriously and with great restraint, so that when crazy things do start happening, they are playing on significant built-up tension. That's the way that I like films, and in a lot of ways, this one shares qualities with horror and/or psychological thrillers, more than 'monster' movies.<br/><br/>Do the human characters seem a bit one-dimensional? Sure, but although this story is told from their points of view, it is clearly not about them. For me, Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and so forth work fine as supporting players, because they do not distract, and indeed feed into, the 'bigger' picture, if you will.<br/><br/>It bears remembering that this story is based on highly-improbable, sensationalized fantasy. If you break it down that way, no, it's not realistic. However, and in this case it is a huge however, the scale, sense of size and realism in this film is breathtaking. I can't imagine that the visual/visceral execution could have been any better, given the subject matter. Things get insane, but never in a cheap way.<br/><br/>Overall, you should see this version of Godzilla if you appreciate foreboding and less-is-more cinematography in your monster movies. This is not a free-for-all action onslaught, although it does have incredible action. Nor is it really 'fun.' But it is serious, skillful and awe- inspiring, the latter to a degree that I have rarely experienced before."

It might help if you are familiar with the old Japanese Godzilla movies, but the new Godzilla was so like the originals; he comes to the rescue of mankind in it's hour of need, and just when you think he is out for the count up he comes again stronger then ever! <br/><br/>Great special effects, and good acting from a largely unknown cast. I actually prefer this to the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick, this is much darker and doesn't have the humour of the earlier version.<br/><br/>A movie I will definitely watch again!<br/><br/>Fingers crossed they will make another, there are lots of other monsters to fight!"
"jgutierrez81","8","1","3","19 May 2014"," gojira! the king of monsters is back
","just finished watching the movie and i have to say, i honestly expected much more but...this was still a pretty awesome movie. so first off the good. 1. Godzilla looks awesome the MOTO's were really cool looking although they have nothing to do with the original MOTO's these were original monsters. 2. the CGI was just amazing in every sense of the word. 3. the origin story was well thought out and leaves open the possibility of other future monsters. essentially the moto's are gargantuan prehistoric monsters that feed off primordial earths radioactivity and as the radioactivity died out they went underground and to the deep of the oceans to feed off the radioactivity in the subsurface. 4. the story for the most part was pretty serious focusing on the human side amidst the chaos. 5. the fight scenes were really cool and well, they basically flatten everything in sight. now the bad... 1. although serious the story was rather bland with very uninteresting characters. also the use of children to bring drama to the story was a little too obvious.i mean seriously you get to see the innocent faces of children in danger like 6 times throughout the movie. 2. cheese factor...the ending was extremely cheesy but i think it was meant as an homage to the original movies. the children again, just over the top. we get it they're in danger. Kevin Watanabe although an amazing actor in his own right was just bland and one dimensional. he basically played the nervous worried scientist that somehow knows what Godzilla wants and knows how to stop the monster invasion by simply letting them fight it out...seriously his most memorable line is ""let them fight"". which sounds cool until you actually watch him say it. 4. fight scenes although spectacular could have been much better if we actually saw them fight. we know they fight because we see it through windows and television sets and the eyes of the people who are far enough away so as to not get hurt. we only really see the last 15 minutes of the last fight. 5. the sound editing was weird. moments when it feels like you need dramatic music or sounds are mute for some reason. i'm assuming the director felt that the silence was more dramatic then adding an actual dramatic musical tone. 6. Bryan Cranston's role, the best one by the way, was cut way to short to the point of false advertising. they basically advertised a much bigger role for Cranston's character and he was really only in the movie like 15 minutes. the best acted 15 minutes of the movie. <br/><br/>so with all this it sound like the movie was bad...but it really wasn't. all in all it was still a really good movie. it just felt like they wanted to go into a more serious direction while bringing on the cheese in order to give an homage to the original films. essentially this felt like an introductory movie and thanks to the origin story, they leave the door open for more monsters (maybe some of the original monsters), which i'm fine with because i can see this becoming a very successful franchise. i say watch it for yourself, most people will love this movie. and i have renewed my Godzilla fandom. i'm happy i saw this movie, it was entertaining and fun to watch and i cant wait for the sequel. ooh yes one more thing Godzillas atomic breath was so freaking cool."
"thisjustinsherman","7","1","3","18 May 2014"," More Godzilla in Godzilla, please!
","I liked this movie. It gave me everything I wanted out of a Godzilla movie, if not nearly enough of it. Godzilla was every bit the badass he should be, not some 'little lizard in the big city' ala the horrible 98 picture, but the Earth's bull-in-a-china-shop Sheriff that he's supposed to be. While certainly not a dude in a suit, his design is highly reminiscent of the original, and having grown up loving Godzilla movies, it was fantastic nostalgia to watch him bust out old favourite moves in high-budget 3-D.<br/><br/>That all said, there were some things about the movie which grated. First off, while Brian Cranston does a great job, the story which the movie follows becomes rather redundant, and really actually kind of irritating, after about the first half-hour to forty-five minutes.<br/><br/>In the build-up it's a solid story, nothing 'Oscar for screenplay' worthy certainly, but the sort of decent drama and character establishment which the closest modern comparison, Pacific Rim, completely failed to muster. It got you emotionally invested in Cranston's character, and by extension the characters around him.<br/><br/>The problem is that long after the build-up, those characters remain the irksomely central focus of the movie, quite literally obstructing our view of the action. Several times the movie has these ""Oh..! Oh...! AWWW, Come onn..!"" moments, where some really cool monster-battling is -just- getting started, only to cut away abruptly to one of the characters answering a phone/riding a train, with perhaps brief and tiny flashes of the awesome battle you wish you were watching on a TV in the background.<br/><br/>There comes a point in the movie where the story of the supporting characters should really move out of centre-stage for the main character, the titular Godzilla... but it never happens. Instead, the story finds ways of carrying the supporting characters through each situation to the end, even getting one personally involved with the monsters in a really weird, goofy way.<br/><br/>All in all though, my review boils down to this: NEEDS MORE MONSTER BRAWLS!"

","7.5 out of 10<br/><br/>IMDb should really invest in programming half-stars into their site (just saying guys, it isn't a bad idea) because I feel 7 is squeaking by with a passing score and an 8 is too generous. Now at the time of exiting the theater, I tend to give movies a higher score (riding on that popcorn high, what can I say). But now that the smoke has cleared, I can peer into the film and see things I normally would not have noticed at the time of viewing.<br/><br/>Let's begin by saying that this movie is a VAST improvement over the hot mess that was Roland Emmerich's attempt to choke the life out of the king of monsters by making him a her and her an overly glorified iguana laying ALIEN eggs. What should have been a match made in heaven (the guy makes apocalypse porn, what could've gone wrong?) ended in a complete and total disaster, and not the good kind (if there is such a thing)! Instead of GODZILLA, you got Roland Emmerich's Day Off.<br/><br/>This movie is GODZILLA, and a very fun one at that. I laughed at a commercial for this film when one of the critic's quotes was ""original"". Uh huh. Someone must of missed 60 years of cinema history...<br/><br/>The BAD<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston's too soon and anticlimactic death<br/><br/>I felt a bit cheated on this one. Here you hire one of the most talented modern dramatic actors who gives stunning performance after stunning performance. He takes ownership of each scene he is in, because you know what? He lives there, on the silver screen, and at long last Cranston moves from television to film and takes a part in a movie that could've easily redefined, SERIOUSLY redefined human drama in a disreputable movie genre. But nope, we get an unfulfilled story arc that would have been SO much more interesting than my number two...<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character and performance<br/><br/>So boring. That's it.<br/><br/>That's all that can really be said of this dismal, cardboard cutout of a character that is so over done, so uninspired, so clichéd that when Cranston's character just gets zipped up and the camera pans up and focuses on Johnson, the movie is literally telling you: remember when you were excited that Walter White and not Ferris Bueller was going to star in this film? Yeah well, you'll have to make do with this guy. At that point, I slowly uttered the word: $h!+. <br/><br/>The GOOD<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's Score<br/><br/>I love Desplat and his often overlooked scores (especially for Wes Anderson films, the man needs a shiny golden idol to worship). Brassy, boisterous, and bound for greatness, this music sets the tone for the film pitch perfect (pardon the pun). It also captures a feeling of not only dinosaurs roaming the Earth, but other creatures that defy classification. Catchy. <br/><br/>THE SOUND<br/><br/>Yes. Yes. Yes. Hell yes. A thousand times yes. THIS is how a science-fiction monster movie should sound. When I went to the seven o'clock premiere in IMAX, little could've prepared my body and ears for what was about to occur. Upon Godzilla's first ascension from the sea to the coast of Hawaii and uttered his roar, the theater cheered, clapped, and screamed, ""HELL YEAH!"" at the screen. Chills. <br/><br/>The Direction and Fan Service <br/><br/>Yes sir, Gareth Edwards has proved whether it be the setting sun in Japan, the falling of soldiers through the sky, a quarantine zone in Tokyo, or the battling of titans through this sophomore effort that his mind can give birth to some fantastic and often jaw dropping and gorgeous visuals. More importantly, this man respects the source material. Note: that the first time we mention Godzilla is through a character callback of an original Godzilla character: Dr. Serizawa. Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the brilliant and mysterious Dr. Ichiro Serizawa is small, understated, corny, but great. They first discover the creature in 1954 (the original release date of the first film) and he utters the word *dramatic pause* Gojira. Awesome.<br/><br/>The M.U.T.O.'s <br/><br/>Very intriguing monster designs. A hybrid of insect and gorilla, these two create some of the more interesting scenes such as the sweet husband giving his big lady a kiss and a nuke and the mother crying out in agony after discovering that her children were set ablaze. I was strangely conflicted after that last one: on the one hand they're the last of their species trying to survive and continue their legacy and on the other we would all die. Powerful. <br/><br/>The Build<br/><br/>A lot of the time, movies jump the gun and blow their payload too soon. With Godzilla, you're teased and teased until the final climatic battle when you, at last, finally see the radioactive lizard in all of his glory. While this immensely frustrated a lot of viewers, we live in a time of instant gratification where we need things, and we need them NOW. Well I'm here to tell those people: You don't understand how Godzilla movies work, and yet you're going to one anyway. Good things take time, great things take even longer. It's the way of all things, ESPECIALLY spectacle and storytelling. While Jaws did it best, this movie is no push over in that regard. <br/><br/>This movie has flaws, big ones at that. Still, like the monsters it depicts, scars can make things more interesting. It shows times of weakness and humility. Godzilla is far from a God, but avid fans say otherwise. Regardless, he shall continue his reign as King of the Monsters."

","Okay, so I've rated a six. Let me explain: The sound editing, CGI work, graphics, and cinematography were pretty good. I enjoyed it. My biggest turn off was its poor screenplay.<br/><br/>For one, I thought Godzilla is an evil overly-grown monster that causes destruction and harm to the human race. There's a great Wikipedia page to further inform you in case you're interested. Of course Hollywood had to screw up the storyline. I'm not going to insert any spoilers here, but let's just say that if Godzilla would've started taking pictures with the human race I wouldn't have been shocked. Gareth Edwards made Godzilla seem like the nicest, most harmless creature ever. Needless to mention that Edwards xeroxed an epic Saving Private Ryan moment (When Tom Hanks' character 'eradicated' a tank with his hang gun""), that really bothered me. <br/><br/>The elaborate fighting scenes were compelling only because of the great CGI and sound work. Otherwise, the movie was filled with cheesy lines, a story line that was simply false, and a poor screenplay."
"metalrage666","8","1","3","18 May 2014"," Finally a modern Godzilla that's worth watching!
","I had some serious misgivings about this going in, but I was determined not to read any negative reviews and make up my own mind and I can say that this recent outing on the legendary Japanese monster was unbelievable.<br/><br/>Remember all those early 50's pacific nuclear ""tests"" we were told about? Well it turns out they they were actually attempts to try and destroy Godzilla, but in fact all we did was make him stronger as he fed off the radiation.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the late 90's and we have an American family living in Japan. The father played by Bryan Cranston works at a nuclear power plant and identifies regular sound waves and, in realising that they are not earthquakes, tries to shut the reactor down as they become stronger and potentially damaging. All too late however as the reactor is breached resulting in the death of his wife who also works there. The facility ends up being destroyed by something unseen and the whole coastal city is evacuated and declared a quarantine zone.<br/><br/>Turns out that the quarantine zone is no such thing and they have re-built the facility to perform tests on a giant cocoon that was found previously in the Philippines. The cocoon hatches and a large monster called a MUTO - Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism, emerges. After destroying the facility and killing Bryan Cranston, among many others, it flies off. Too me this looked like an updated version of Rodan from the old Godzilla movies.<br/><br/>A second and much larger MUTO that was ""contained"" in the nuclear waste dump deep in the Yucca Mountains wakes up, breaks free of the mountain and devastates downtown Las Vegas. It is believed that the 2 MUTO's will link up by way of echo-location and that the larger one is a female, making the other a winged male. So the race is on to try and stop these monsters before they get together and reproduce.<br/><br/>It is assumed by some that Godzilla is actually meant to restore balance on the Earth and a Japanese scientist pleads with the military to let Godzilla and the MUTO's just fight it out. The movie audience was wishing the exact same thing. After the military fails to do what it thinks it can, just like every other Godzilla movie, (except the awful 1998 version), and after flattening San Francisco for their battle ground, Godzilla reigns supreme once again and is regarded ""King of Monsters"" in the newspapers. It's too bad that he uses his death ray only twice. <br/><br/>This movie for me was a welcome addition to the long running Godzilla franchise. After the 1998 movie threatened to kill off such a legendary monster with bad acting, bad effects, bad dialogue and a Godzilla that didn't even look like Godzilla, this was a blast of pure energy that only a proper Godzilla can produce. The only thing that ruined it for me is the one constant that all disaster movies want to have and that is a soppy human element that tries to make the audience feel something for the characters. I'm sorry but this just doesn't work and I wish they'd stop doing it as no one really cares. In Godzilla, all you want to see is monsters fighting, and buildings being reduced to rubble, not constant flashbacks to how the rest of the family was coping. This is however a great monster flick and one that will be worth seeing multiple times."

","I'm a fan of Gozilla movies. And this was way better than the Matthew Broderick one. But being a fan this is a straight forward Godzilla movie with better CGI. It wasn't mind blowing so it's no as 10, but it was satisfying. And I'm not going to include any spoilers but seriously it's impossible to spoil a Godziila movie. Giant lizard + mankind. Shake and watch stuff get destroyed. Some issues: I thought they took to long setting up the movie. And a slight issue with the creature design. And as I said the story was straight forward. And we didn't get enough of Godzilla's fire breathe because when they did show it, it was great. The movie feature some talented actors and actresses but this movie really didn't need THAT much acting. Fun to see the dude from Kick A in another movie. But regardless of who is in it, it is entertaining and that's all that counts with this type of movie. I say a must see on the big screen."

","Warner Bros.' new Godzilla is a fat load all right, not just because of the fuller figure the sea beast flaunts on screen.

You wish there was more of it coming.<br/><br/>The film's script has an interesting spin which, if discussed in detail, would be a spoiler and rob all the magic. much better than 1998 because it has much character included in this film than just massive destruction all over the place.

","I have problems with this movie. I wish I could love it, given that we've all heard so much about it finally happening back in 2010. One hour before I went to see it, I watched a 12-minute behind the scenes featurette to see all the talent and effort that went into literally bringing Godzilla to life, only to see him appear roughly 20 minutes throughout a 2 hour movie. Even the villain MUTO (A new American monster) gets a little more screen time in a film that can be summed up thusly: <br/><br/>Act 1. was Fantastic. Arguably the flick feels it was made for those uninitiated to the monster or franchise, and everything you need to know is brought up to scratch in those superb opening credits. Characters are established swiftly, plus a very engaging performance from Bryan Cranston (Who should have also gotten more screen time) and the main villain is established. Act 2. is sadly dull. The military prove futile (In a Godzilla movie who knew?) as we are following lone soldier Ford (Aaron Taylor Johnson) in undoubtedly very atmospheric set pieces, yet boring exposition that kills pacing and skips over the monsters fighting in Hawaii. Also another MUTO arrives, who is larger and is a female planning to reproduce (I would have thought they would like to have strayed as far away from the 1998 film as possible). Act 3. we see monsters finally fighting, and IT IS A SPECTACLE TO BEHOLD. In a day and age where disaster movies like ""Transformers"" happen, stuff is obviously going to be heavily destroyed without much regard to peoples safety. The amount of debris and smoke rising around these monsters give such a weight to the scope and image, it definitely exceeds what your expectations were. Unfortunately by the end you just wished the movie focused more on these monsters instead of the cut and paste characters.<br/><br/>This is where a level of bias may come into the review, but hear me out. The 1954 movie featured only Godzilla, and small scenes of people's reactions to the devastation he commits. All of this eventually leads to a solution that while simple continues to provide a very strong anti War message. All following sequels eventually had him fighting all manner of creative monsters, and that became everything those movies were built around. Personal preference, but if you're going to have three gorgeously rendered monsters in a movie with such a fantastic climax, chances are that's what people want to see more than the human side of the story. Albeit one that was OK, but got very lost midway.<br/><br/>Aside from the horrible things I've said, this movie has some wonderful acting especially from Cranston & Ken Watanabe. The camera shots were superb, and I'd still say Gareth Edwards was the best choice for this movie. However, it strangely just doesn't feature Godzilla as much as a ""Godzilla"" movie should, and it all feels more like a sequel to Edwards 2010 flick ""Monsters"". They'd also probably been better off including another monster, rather than just a larger, female MUTO.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done the story was okay, the set pieces are stunning and when Godzilla showed up, HE SHOWED UP. After a decades absence, the ""King of the Monsters"" can still bring me back to the joys I had watching it as a child. Hopefully with the success it's having, it will demand a more solid follow up in the future. 7/10."

"alexrabbitte_1","7","1","3","18 May 2014"," A solid Monster-Mash!!!
","Going into watching Godzilla not at all watching any of the trailers and not anticipating it to live up to the expectation,Godzilla does a lot to address the faults within this genre type such as elongated scenes and insignificant scenes. Godzilla manages to balance a lot of the key factors such as the many minutes we see both the monsters and people and not stray off on a tangent but there are some subtle faults that maybe could of been addressed.<br/><br/>The narrative and this whole idea of Nuclear anxiety(relating back to the original film in 1954)which is an occurring theme that drives the majority of the film is built up at the very start of the film rather well as it does create this great expectation that we do get. The archived footage helps us see this as it blends in with glimpses of this reptile creature which obviously symbolises that something catastrophic will happen.What I personally liked about this film knowing that I didn't watch any of the trailers to spoil my self and how I really don't know much in depth about other Godzilla stories was the sequence near the start where we see scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham (Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) exploring a cave in the Philippines of not just a skeleton, but two egg pods which honestly surprised me in a good way.Even though this idea of having Godzilla and the M.U.T.O (Massive unidentified terrestrial organism) may have been a risky move by Director Gareth Edwards and how it could of been a huge mess of just pure fighting an unbalance in terms of the number of times they appear on screen (which mainly is probably one of the main reasons why some people detest this film), he at least has made this bold but successful move of adding more monsters and quite frankly, Edwards has done a good job of balancing out the colossal fighting sequences with the human perspectives and how they are handling and struggling with these behemoths. Although Godzilla does make his full appearance known around the one hour mark which again has had many people being critical of the pacing and momentum of the film, the first time we see the all powerful figure and hear this god-like roar it certainly delivers shivers down the spine. Personally I find the pacing of the film reasonable; the first hour leading up to the immense scenes feel natural and doesn't really drag at all. While it can argued that the human perspective of the story near towards the end doesn't engage you to sympathise with the characters that we get to know throughout, the opening sequences make up for that with the character of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston).<br/><br/>Out of all the acting performances, no one can really go against how good Bryan Cranston is in terms of what sought of character he has to adapt. The character of Joe Brody (a nuclear physicist at Janjira nuclear plant) who is quickly accustomed living a life filled with grief,tragedy,anger and sadness is a character that does seem to be difficult to manage to which Cranston does very well when we see him diverge himself in a life full of conspiracy and agonising mystery trying to find out what really happened at the plant. Although his performance can be seen as insignificant and could of perhaps been situated around another person, Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays Lieutenant Ford Brody (son of Joe Brody)and is profoundly the main person we follow does a stable job of well.. showing us the human perspective of the struggle against the beasts and that's all there is to his character really. The only positive that I got from his performance was his on-screen chemistry with Elizabeth Olsen's character Elle Brody and how they bounced off each other really well as a married couple. It is a bit of a shame however for Olsen who doesn't really get a stagnant and more of a engaging role to really connect with her character. There are glimpses of her where she is nursing people around the hospital where I feel they could of perhaps focused more on her story as well and what it was like for her when Godzilla and the Male/female M.U.T.O were bashing at each other rather than seeing Ford Brody's perspective for the majority of the time. As for Ken Watanabe.. he is certainly the character with the stereotypical lines. Although his role is supposed to be vital to the narrative, the lines and the way he delivers them will be the only thing remembered about his character.. trust me. One last thing to inform all of you for those who want to watch this film.... DON'T WATCH IT IN 3-D. Iv'e always said that 3-D is a cheap gimmick which is supposed to 'ENTICE' the film-goer and Godzilla in 3-D is a good example of WHY YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH IT IN 3-D!!! it seriously adds nothing and at times the foreground of the images that appear aren't really focused properly which is annoying so PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br/><br/>Having said this however, Godzilla is in my book a good piece for the monster/disaster genre. Again the bold but successful inclusion of different monsters including obviously Godzilla genuinely surprised me and adds another dimension to this genre of films. The time you see Bran Cranston on screen is really pleasing to see but doesn't really get appreciated due to how the other human perspectives play out throughout the film. It's hard to say whether Godzilla will be one of the best films to be released this year in 2014 due to other major films yet to be released. However if it doesn't get to be one of the top rated films of this year (which i'm sure it will be),overall it's stable entry for the action genre as well making a SOLID MONSTER-MASH!!<br/><br/>I give Godzilla 7/10<br/><br/>Alex Rabbitte"

","it's not really surprising to me that most of the reviews here are polarizing. godzilla movies typically follow two paths; godzilla goes to a city and destroys stuff, or the movies more focused on a rival that godzilla has to defeat. this is the latter, which may deter some people expecting a straight up godzilla movie. that said, it does nothing new. like godzilla 1998, this is a movie is for parents to bring their kids. unlike 1998 it's dedicated to honoring the franchises style for better or worse. for example, the protagonists are flat and uninteresting. the film fails to connect the audience with the human characters, as a result everyones favorite character is godzilla, the only one to get applause for it's actions. but for what its worth, it's loaded with destruction. sure it's all cgi, but i have to admit there's creativity on display. it's just a overbudgeted homage, more mindless summer action. i thought it was better than stuff like the iron man sequels, avengers, dark knight rises. it's not a schizophrenic mess of source material, it's just another straight forward godzilla movie. i give it like a 6.5 or 7."

","I had a nice experience watching Godzilla. The casting was alright and the CGI was awesome. However I thought not everything about this movie was well done. First of all I want to mention the fact that a lot of movies today (2014) are in need of a good, well written story if they want to be good. Although in a movie like Godzilla, the story is not very well. I think the story was very cheesy and cliché. I mean it's kind of obvious what is going to happen when you are introduces to the Brody-family. You know that the family is going to be separated and that in the end everything is going to be all right. The fact that this story is so predictable is a large concern for me to this movie. When I go to the theater and watch a movie like Godzilla, I will go there for the action and not for a good story. While watching this movie the term ''MUTO'' came by very often. I was asking myself what kind of name that is for a gigantic beast who is treating the existence of mankind. Not very well chosen IMO. Godzilla itself however was stunning. The growl of Godzilla is awesome and gives a satisfying feeling when watching this movie. <br/><br/>In conclusion I must say that I enjoyed Godzilla very much, but there were a lot of cons that made the movie slightly less good. It's definitely worth seeing in the cinema!"

","Godzilla is a bit of mixed bag; there's plenty of good and bad to go around here. In terms action, visual and sound effects, it's definitely worth the price of admission. There's some great monster battle scenes and a few ""that was amazing!"" moments; make no mistake, the little kid in you will be entertained. The special effects on Godzilla himself are very good, easily the best I've seen to date (though overall the special effects are not as good as Pacific Rim, surprisingly). The depth of 3D really brings him to life on the screen, so seeing it in IMAX 3D is a must. The sound effects however, are outstanding! Some of the best I've ever heard in the theatre and the highlight of the movie for me. There were a few notable occasions where Godzilla roared and the theatre shook! It was very impressive and makes this worth a high end theatre experience. There's also a fantastic sky dive sequence that is beautifully shot with a 2001 A Space Odyssey vibe that will blow your mind (it made the trailer look fantastic), unfortunately it felt slightly out of place as the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to it.<br/><br/>The main characters are clearly miscast and are just not ready for prime time as their love story fees hallow and forced. This wouldn't be such of a big deal, except that film spends too much time trying to make you care about them (and ultimately fails). Heisenberg, err... I mean Bryan Cranston is serviceable in his role if not very good, unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time. Ken Watanabe is so bad I have to assume it was intentionally so and was a humorous homage to cheesy scientist characters from past Gozilla movies. He also has way too many ""stares off into nothing"" moments that are really funny. The dialogue was really cheesy and forgettable but I kind of expected that; this is a Godzilla movie after all. The story is nothing more than a formality and it's just used to conveniently put the characters at the right place and time, just as another monster appearance is imminent. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie I wasn't quite satisfied as I wish there was more of Godzilla himself and given that's the whole point of this movie, I have to say I'm slightly disappointed (unlike how I feel after Pacific Rim). Go in with low expectations and you'll have a good time. Am I expecting too much from a giant monster movie? Possibly.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","10","16 May 2014"," The King of the Monsters undone by utter-seriousness . . .
","The most tickling moment in Godzilla comes when we first see the creature. He's revealed slowly; first a shot of his foot, then his hip, then his hands, and then his world-famous dino-mug. What's tickling is that he almost seems to be smiling - or possibly sneering. The fact that, at that moment, he is nose to nose with another giant monster makes it seem as if he's silently saying ""Bring it on!"" Unfortunately, moments like that are few and far between in the new Godzilla, which teeters uneasily between campy-ness and utter seriousness. The serious parts are nearly fatal to the movie because they drag real-life weight into a movie that doesn't need it. Who wants real life in movie about a dinosaur battling a bug? The concept works well, seeing what The King of The Monsters looks like goosed up with a $160 million budget. It's definitely a sign of the times. Yesteryear's B-pictures are today's A-pictures. That's what director Gareth Edwards has to work with. He's a former visual effects artist who knows how to build suspense visually, with all the signs and portents that something beneath the earth is stirring. He has all the standard scenes of scientists looking at charts and screens of seismic activity that yield nothing but bad news. Then we get those expositions of everything about Godzilla that the government has kept secret for the past half-century. You have to smile when Kan Watanabe informs the assembled group that ""We call him . . . . Godzilla."" The story kicks off in 1999 when some miners in the Philippines unleash something from beneath the earth. Whatever it is, it's causing heavy seismic activity. Naturally only one man really knows what's going on. He's a nervous Nelly named Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston, who gives a much better performance than the movie really deserves) who suffers a personal tragedy when one of the earthquakes causes an explosion at a nuclear plant in Tokyo.<br/><br/>Fast-Forward 15 years, and Joe has become one of those exiled nut jobs who lives in a box-sized apartment that is wallpapered with news articles about the seismic problems in the Far East. That's where his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) comes in. He's a level-headed, explosive ordinance disposal technician for the U.S. Navy who doesn't connect with the old man. Naturally, he also has a wife and child at home.<br/><br/>Credit must be given for the attempt to organize a human relationship. They're obvious and perfunctory, but you admire the effort. You admire the cast too. There's David Strathairn, Juliet Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen and Sally Hawkins. They're all more-or-less filler. We're really interested in seeing the monsters locked in mortal combat. Unfortunately, the movie cuts the fights short for scenes dealing with the humans, and that kills the fantasy element. Nowadays, with our readily available 24 hour news, scenes in which planes crash into buildings and tsunamis wash away populations take us out of the fantasy and remind us of events in real life. Yes, this is only fantasy, but how well you respond to those scenes depends on how your mind is wired to connect it with real events. It alters uneasily with the fantasy. When we see a giant dinosaur stomping through Las Vegas on a mission to beat up radioactive bugs, the movie's realism hits with a thud.<br/><br/>Godzilla makes his way from Japan to the United States to battle subterranean bugs, officially known as M.U.T.O.'s, or Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms – Oh, please tell me that's an official term. Yet, somehow the monster fights seem all too brief. We see the typical monster hug-fights, but then the movie cuts away from those scenes just as they're getting interesting. Much of Godzilla is given to humans milling around and setting up large weapons. It's all done well, but the resulting climax is cut short, as the filmmakers cut away from the monsters and back to the boring humans and their problems.<br/><br/>The technical credits are good but for every good decision here, there's a bad one that follows. Godzilla doesn't show up until at least an hour into the picture (good call), and when he does his scenes seem brief and clouded by behind smoke and darkness (bad call). This is the same issue that plagued last year's Pacific Rim. Why spend millions of dollars to create amazing CGI monsters and then hide them behind darkness and rain? Still, you have to give credit where credit is due, this is a well-made film visually, and it is certainly better than Roland Emmerich's 1998 fiasco. Godzilla isn't a bad movie but you feel as if the focus is in the wrong place."

","Certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Hammy, over the top acting (Bryan Cranston being the worst offender), silly story with so many plot holes that you feel like you've fallen into an illogical abyss. Godzilla only on screen for about 10 minutes and most of the time the monster looked like it was some guy in a suit. Just total, absolute drivel and not even very interesting drivel--I kept falling asleep even with all the explosions and Godzilla occasionally roaring. At least four Oscar-nominated actors in this movie---Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Juliette Binoche. They must've really needed a paycheck to stoop to this. Bryan Cranston's performance I thought was so amateurish I had to wonder, is this the guy everyone's talked about for being such a great actor in ""Breaking Bad""?"
"mitch-nissen","6","2","11","16 May 2014"," A Review From a True Kaiju Film Fan.
","Okay, If you don't want any spoilers I'd advise to tread carefully through this review. I'm going to try to avoid spoilers but some things will be impossible to avoid.<br/><br/>This isn't your father's Godzilla. This new Godzilla is the biggest he's ever been but it's also the lightest he's ever been, meaning that the allegories and the pathos are either gone or diluted to the point in which you don't really care. The fear of nuclear war and the blame on human kind for their destruction of the Earth is virtually gone.<br/><br/>What is here is a monster you want to see win. A monster you want to root for! In this movie Godzilla is the Guardian of Earth! The movie goes the route of the 1970's Godzilla movies in which he is a hero but it isn't as ridiculous as those films. It is the first Godzilla movie to play him as a realistic (as real as a kaiju film can be) good guy and not some Ultra Man wrestling match (not that there is anything wrong with that).<br/><br/>The grim horror and futility of the situation that was so clearly portrayed in the trailers is also gone. Gone are the scenes of crushed trains and dead bodies littering the countryside. The movie takes a considerably more palatable approach and aims for the largest possible audience it can get. From the get go you like Godzilla and your love for him grows as the movie goes on. By the end you're cheering for him. The final monster throwdown is EPIC! The only question really worth asking is: Is it better than the 1998 film of the same title? My answer is a resounding YES!!! Just be prepared for it to not be the movie you think it is. The trailers were misleading and it is nothing like any previous Godzilla film. All the actors do a very good job and the plot is solid.<br/><br/>The film takes a big page from the GAMERA TRILOGY. If you have no idea what I'm referring to then read on. The Gamera Trilogy ( a trio of Japanese Kaiju films made in the mid 1990's) is highly regarded as the best giant monster films ever made. They are the best model for as crazy a concept as Kaiju being successful and overall blow your socks off AWESOMENESS!! I LOVE THE GAMERA TRILOGY!!!! This movie is pound for pound a remake of the Gamera Trilogy. You could swap Godzilla for Gamera in this new Godzilla film, change nothing else about it, and the film would function perfectly as GAMERA 4.<br/><br/>When you watch this movie you'll come out loving Godzilla... albeit for different reason than those you loved about him before. Overall, not the movie I was expecting but definitely a good kaiju film. Will it do well at the box office? I hope so. Should you all go see it? For the reasons I said above, I think you all will like it.<br/><br/>Just know that this is not the Japanese Godzilla. This is the NEW American Godzilla. A hero, not a symbol of the mistakes of mankind and the punishment we all deserve, which is what Godzilla REALLY is.<br/><br/>Essentially Gareth Edwards did to Godzilla what J.J. Abrams did to Star Trek: Made it accessible to all audiences."

","Clearly the studio made a HUGE mistake by casting the always weak Taylor Johnson. That dude can barely act. His unbelievable expression just ruined the movie in its entirety. This, in addition to weak script, uninspired performances by other actor like Olsen, Watanabe and extremely short Godzilla screen time had just cost me 2 hours of my life."
"nmholland","8","1","4","26 January 2016"," Better Than Expected
","Walking into Godzilla, I expected crap. I literally expected to hate the movie, like the last Godzilla movie. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that it was pretty good. Of course it has problems, but they are pretty easily outweighed by the positives. First off, many people will complain about the lack of Godzilla himself in the film. Yes, I wanted him to have a bit more screen time, but the absence was not too obvious. Second, (spoiler alert) Bryan Cranston's character dies. He was by far the most interesting character in the whole film, yet he dies 30 minutes or so into the movie. I'm fine with him dying, it really draws emotion out of his son, played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson, but he dies so early in the film, it washes out both of their characters. This also leads me into the third and biggest problem. I truly didn't care about any (besides Bryan Cranston) of the characters at all. I actually was waiting for one of them to die so we would actually care somewhat the next time watching it, but it didn't happen. This really threw me off on how I felt about the movie. After seeing it, I went home and thought about it a lot. I really did enjoy it overall, but these problems really weigh it down. The CGI was absolutely amazing, with breathtaking shots of Godzilla fighting the Muto, and I really enjoyed the cinematography. Overall, I think Godzilla should get a B+, or an 8 out of 10."

","Some reviewers said they do not know why some people hate this movie?! I have the answer for them: Those who do not like this movie are looking for a small piece of logic and intellectuality in the plot! And believe me, there is (close to) none!<br/><br/>I liked reviews from the users ""Critomaton"" and ""babyvett-3-890268"". So, I just refer you to those ones as they mostly covered all semantic and technical problems of this movie. I just want to ask some questions from the writers:<br/><br/><ul><li>How come in some parts of the movie, US army shoots the Godzilla and in some parts they ignore him and put their ships beside him?! (before knowing that he is going to help them)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does the US army sends troops into the jungle or atomic repositories when one helicopter can do the job and they have so many of them?! In the part that they want to figure out the MUTO in the atomic waste repository, they send soldiers to check. In the next shot we see a whole as big as the Egyptian pyramids in the mountain and a helicopter is flying over it!! Isn't this stupid? Could not they just send a helicopter?! Or should not the helicopter saw and reported the whole or the Giant Mantis (MUTO) before the soldiers?!!! JUST STUPID!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The MUTOs strangely have an ability to turn off all electronic devices! OK... I have no problem with MUTOs figuring out how to deactivate the electric devices. However, they have been evolved and extincted long before the discovery of electronic devices and electricity and scientifically they won't be able to evolve this way! But,... OK! Fine! We accept this! What I cannot accept is how come an army is that stupid that despite seeing MUTOs can destroy helicopters and jets in a second, still send plenty of them close to the MUTOs!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why most of authorities controlling Japanese facilities are Americans?! There is just one Japanese scientist!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How come the US troops let a soldier just ride with them without any type of background check or even knowing him?! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How come an old man and his son (the lieutenant) suddenly become so important that all 15 year old secrets are shared with them?!</li></ul>"
"maximumcool","3","1","4","12 February 2015"," My hopes were shattered
","I only got around to watching this movie in Feb of 2015 so I'd heard some friends cheer for it and others criticize it. I loved the movie ""Monsters"" so I was really hoping that this movie would be as good and be a solid step forward for the director. But this movie sucks. I mean the CGI was very impressive but other than that there wasn't a shred of logic to it, the characters were boring, I hate to say it but Bryan Cranston was overacting like crazy for pretty much his entire role, and the government and military were just stupid stupid stupid the entire movie long. There were dozens of good choices they could have made to fight these monsters but they clung to doing what had already failed them because it was convenient to the plot. Their complete inability to keep track of the movements of a giant monster despite having satellites and super-sonic aircraft at their disposal was not believable in the slightest. The science was a complete joke and the movie would have been much better off with them just saying ""Yeah, we're not really sure what's going on... something with radiation we think"" and just leaving it at that. Overall it felt like a movie where the writer or director came up with a bunch of ""cool scenes"" (like Godzilla swimming under an aircraft carrier) and then tried to just string them all together into a story.<br/><br/>Just a complete waste of everyone's time and money and another failure to produce a decent Gozilla movie. I give it a 3/10 for the pretty CGI and the visually impressive sequence of them dropping into the city in the final act of the movie (y'know, the sequence they showed in the trailers for it)."
"dmann135","4","1","4","9 February 2015"," Stop trying to make Godzilla movies, already!
","If you would have told me in the 1970's that the Godzilla franchise would only get worse, I would have told you that you were crazy. Well, here we are, and it did. Okay, maybe I'm slightly exaggerating. The 2014 Godzilla movie had great potential in the early part of the film, by mid-way through, though, I had lost interest. I'll be honest, I didn't even watch the final 1/4 of the movie. Pros: It hearkened back to its roots by beginning in Japan. It had a very plausible story line, considering the subject matter. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche helped to give the film credibility with excellent performances. MUTO was very well designed and the true monster star of the movie, getting much more screen time than Godzilla. Cons: The storyline relocated to the United States. The performances and chemistry of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were terrible. The portrayal of a bumbling, inept U.S. military. Godzilla, he got very little screen time and the design was a bit of a let down, although, that's a personal preference since I prefer my Godzilla with a little bit of a neck."
"eboley99-984-39724","9","1","4","10 January 2015"," I'm BAFFLED this has such a low score. Really????
","The main complaint I've heard from people was ""Godzilla isn't even in it until the final 20 minutes!"".... ummmm, have you ever heard of anticipation? Building the tension? If they would have thrown Godzilla in your face the entire movie the final battle wouldn't have felt nearly as impactful or epic. It's a lot like horror movies that insist on throwing blood and gore in your face. They aren't scary or suspenseful. The scariest horror films are the ones that DON'T show you everything all at once. It's a simple, but effective storytelling tool that goes back to Alfred Hitchock. Overall, I loved this movie. It was one of the most exhilarating movie theater experiences I've had in a long time. My only real complaint was that Bryan Cranstons' character died too early. The human part of the story could have used him in the final act. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend going with the expectations that you won't see a lot of Godzilla in the first half of the movie. Allow the suspense to build. Immerse yourself in the story. Then you'll feel very satisfied by the end of it."

","This is a spin-off and is NOT directly related to the original Godzilla movie ... that aside ... The movie by itself wasn't very interesting or tightly woven ...

The movie was dominated by the flying, so-called scary but funny looking large mosquito or grasshopper like creatures! Except for the graphics .. nothing watchable and poor acting makes the movie a sloppy tale. There's no concrete storyline, loosely written storyline and while they predict the monsters are meeting for breeding, looked like it was already having eggs ... NOT sure how! Not sure why those monsters would die with Godzilla's atomic breadth, when it is feeding on nuclear energy all along!

"Sherazade","5","1","4","23 October 2014"," If its intent was not insult the intelligence of the viewer...
","it could have been better but either the screenwriter or the film's director was just hellbent on treating the film's audience like we all have intellectual disabilities. The acting by the film's woefully underused albeit supremely talented cast (Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Elizabeth Olsen, Sally Hawkins) was solid and superb but unfortunately the moderately talented ones who were thrown to the forefront just did not measure up to what could have been. You already have a legendary main villain/monster(i.e. Godzilla) now throw in one or two other veritable sidekicks and the premise just sweetens on the page but the result is gross over-ambition rather cinematographic excellence. The simple premise of a monster laying dormant for many years feeding off of nuclear energy underground/underwater and finally emerging to terrorise the populous is made complex with unnecessary twists and turns and the pointless need to show off technology that is neither revolutionary nor spectacular. We have seen it all before and done better might I add (the Jurassic Park films, Pacifim Rim, Cloverfield) just to mention a few. When asked in an interview if she enjoyed her brief but dramatic presence in the film, Juliette Binoche said this: ""I don't know how much fun you can have when you have to die in two seconds, and you're the one real woman character and you're dead in three minutes and 45 seconds."" I rest my case."

"spaceways","3","1","4","16 September 2014"," Fundamental lack of storytelling -- big disappointment.
","I'm a hard core Godzilla and kaiju fan. I had hoped this movie would be at least passable. And it isn't, due to a basic lack of storytelling. It's boring. You don't care about the characters. The ""Muto"" monsters are insipid -- who has ever heard of these before? What do they have to do with anything, anyway?! The computer special effects you've seen before, over and over. Half the movie takes place at night and it's difficult to see anything, really. That gets plain old annoying after a while. Fancier and fancier special effects DO NOT ADD ANYTHING to a movie.<br/><br/>There's a lack of suspense from start to finish. The movie drags. I wish they'd take all the money they waste on special effects and hire a couple of decent writers, you know. I'm fine with old-school special effects and guys in monster suits crushing models. But TELL A DECENT STORY. It's as if they tried to make a cake out of just frosting and fluff and there's no cake underneath it. <br/><br/>It just is not that difficult to tell a basic story. This is like shooting darts and somebody makes such a bad shot it misses the dartboard entirely. I would have loved for this movie to be even halfway decent, I was looking forward to it so much. <br/><br/>I did very, VERY much like Elizabeth Olsen, who is a real babe. Just gorgeous. Strong screen presence. She can act.<br/><br/>How do you blow something like this? The details of the production don't matter, but how could you manage to not deliver the basic elements of a story. Watch some old Ultraman episodes from the 1960s. Zero budget, but they told a story and had characters you cared about. This version of Godzilla just doesn't get it. Very unfortunate. <br/><br/>Learn how to tell a story! I'm not asking for the Moon."

","""This is not an electrical malfunction."" After a nuclear meltdown in Japan Joe Brody (Cranston) is forced to flee his home. Nothing ever set well with him about with the whole accident. When he is caught trying to sneak back into the city he is caught and his son Ford (Taylor-Johnson) must go get him. When a similar event happens Joe and his son are enlisted to help figure out what is wrong. It turns out that Joe's instincts were right. I will open by saying that I have never really been a big fan of Godzilla. I have only watched one of the original series and the 90's one with Matthew Broderick. Going into this one my only real expectation was that it will be better than that one. I was not wrong. That said the movie I think tried to do too much. The first half of the movie was watching the scientists try to figure out what was going on. When you sit down to watch a monster movie you really want to get right to the action. This is a movie I will review in two aspects. When the monsters were not on the screen the movie was a little slow moving and hard to stay interested in. The entire time you are just thinking blah, blah, blah lets see action. On the other hand when the monsters are on screen and fighting the movie is entertaining and I could have watched a movie of just that. Once again not being a fan of the Godzilla movies I do have to say this was better than I expected I just wish there was more of the monster aspect. Overall, better then expected and worth seeing but be prepared for the movie to drag a little when the action isn't happening. I give this a low B+."

","Very very very very very very very bad film, seriously. heading it to it i was full of expectation, and honestly thought i was in for a 'decent' movie considering the generous rating some of the faithful IMDb fans had given. However i was extremely disappointed with the film and some of the sub-par acting performances. I really think there was some deep rooted environmental-nature-god like bullshit trying to be portrayed by the movie and it just didn't work, the headline 'king of the creatures' at the end, while fans were cheering the triumphant creature (Godzilla) really put the icing on the cake. I mean come on. how lame do you want to be?. Like seriously. On a more positive note though, i thought Bryan Cranston delivered a good performance in the time he was in it, but the film died when his character died out, and may i say i thought it was way to early for his character to meet his untimely demise. I can only assume he reviewed the rest of the script and knew it would be best to call it a night when he did. Overall i think the four is generous score, but then again i have watched the film 'Mega shark vs Meca shark' so it would be pretty harsh to score lower then that."

Unfortunately it is far from it it's not as dark,gloomy and scary as Cloverfield. Main focus is on people and their actions while monsters are shown only sometimes and very briefly. The camera work is great when they are showing monsters, it really makes huge impact and you can feel the seriousness of situation. I actually had to check if it's not the same director who made Cloverfield, as I was seeing lots of similarities, which of course is great.

It was an unwise decision to kill off the best actor in the movie, Bryan Cranston. He acts good as he usually does, before he killed off for no reason, and replaced with a young, mediocre actor, for the rest of the movie.

Because why would they take down the cardboard insert, even years after the actual DVD disappeared?<br/><br/>I borrowed the subtitled original instead.<br/><br/>Never watch Gojira. Ever.

Unfortunately, the paratrooper sequence is underwhelming as a result.<br/><br/>Thus continues the search for any redeeming quality in the general practice of trailer viewing.<br/><br/>Sally Hawkins can be put to much better use. Although she delivers a more than proficient performance, it's not a strong role. Which is similar to the part she plays in another great movie, The Double, released a week previous. But she's outstanding in Blue Jasmine, even receiving the Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.<br/><br/>Hopefully we see more of Sally in the future.<br/><br/>Other than Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche, the acting's only okay.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen is pretty good.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson isn't bad, but he completely lacks charisma.<br/><br/>All in all, Godzilla is great enough for what it is.<br/><br/>I'm sure the sequel's going to give us, at the very least, a peak at King Kong.<br/><br/>Consider this a challenge to the filmmakers: Be original and release an 'R' rated sequel.<br/><br/>You may not make the same haul domestically (which is debatable), but it'd be a way better movie. Folks would applaud the creativity and ambition.<br/><br/>Plus, you could ratchet up the horror.<br/><br/>And who doesn't love a good scare?"

","I went to the theater with no expectations because after all it's a Godzilla flick. I was pleasantly surprised to actually find myself in a moderately suspenseful film even though I already know what the monster is going to be. And the story seems plausible enough to make it interesting to sit through. Sound effects, darkness and good use of silence at some points helped create tension. Kudos to the director for finding original avenues of visual interest. <br/><br/>There have been comments by some that Godzilla looks fat or his head is undersized, but I think the movie does a good job making him original and bad ass looking. He could be a hero or a villain. With an American audience that is essentially brain numbed by CGI vomit every summer, Godzilla holds it's own pretty well without the overly noisy and nauseating visual bombast of Bay. Again I love the use of darkness and the pauses of sound in the film. <br/><br/>The movie made about $500mil worldwide and even did well in Japan. In the future they will have to decide what opponents Godzilla will face. And since they can't hide him again they will have to find new ways to create suspense and build characters. I hope they add more science and paleontology because it gives the movie depth. Showing visual comparisons to dinosaurs or whales that we all already know. And I hope they keep the same filming style.<br/><br/>The sequel is scheduled for 2016. Can't wait."

","I have been waiting for this movie for so long. Bringing back the almighty king of destruction, Godzilla, seemed to be a thrilling experience. But deception thrilled me instead. I was expecting Godzilla to destroy entire cities without any difficulty and smashing through the defences that cocky humans would have set. After all, he's the king of destruction... RIGHT? Well, looks like the director didn't agree with me. He preferred to bring 2 evil MUTOs (which were the ""good guys"" who got rid of Godzilla in the original film), to make them breed and to have Godzilla, who was supposed to be the king of destruction not some ""bringing balance"" stuff, stop them. Neither Godzilla, nor the MUTOs seem to have the direct desire to destroy any city at all. In the end, it's just a fight between giant creatures, so basically Pacific Rim without a long intro. The movie is still enjoyable, and the blue flame coming out of Godzilla's mouth is brilliant. But as I said, I already saw Pacific Rim, thank you.<br/><br/>Slayer \m/"

","I read several user reviews and the first one I read was right on the money. This is a monster movie that tips it's hat to the Godzilla of the 1950's. If you loved the cheesy dialog and campy fun of those then you will love this movie. Of course, the CGI adds a lot that the early movie couldn't, then again you also lose the laughs of an obvious toy stomping around on thousands of fleeing Japanese. Outside of that though the similarities are endless, the dialog is wooden, the lines in some places are laughable. The plot could be predicated by any cinema knowledgeable 6 year old. and please don't go to see it for the acting, I promise you will leave disappointed.<br/><br/>The long and short of it is, if you loved the old Godzilla(as I do), you will love this one even more, otherwise stay home.

","I have been a Godzilla Fan since the late 60's/early 70's. I was looking forward to see this movie, but I was very disappointed! First of all, why was this movie called Godzilla when he was shown towards the end of the movie for less than 20 minutes? The alien creature had more time. And why did it become a drama movie instead of a science fiction/horror movie? A solider trying to avenge his parents. Also when in all the Godzilla movies when did he defeated a monster with one hit with his tail and one atomic breath? It take him half the movie to fight in the other movies. After he defeated the monster creatures, why didn't he just go back to the ocean? Godzilla never gets tired! He's radioactive! If the US Military transporting a weapon, where was the air support? OK cause of the E.M.I. They could used drones, when they fail would be a warning sign. But how did the train go across the bridge was it a steam engine? Let me know if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>In summary: What part of this movie supposed the be near being realistic? US film Godzilla (1998) was more realistic. Sorry. I understand some people liked it (younger viewers). I suggest to watch the 1954 original Godzilla movie again.<br/><br/>That is just my view on this movie! Thanks for reading!"

Having said that, Godzilla isn't in the film all that much. But he looks realistic and is the Godzilla we know and love. This is one of the few films that actually lives up to the expectations set up by the trailer. There are two other creatures in the film, as well as a few human characters.

","I get this is blockbuster, designed to put bums on seats to watch a spectacle. And boy is it spectacular. The problem is that the characters are basically one dimensional and the script is a thin series of clichés designed to fit between the epic CGI set pieces. Where the '98 Godzilla trumps this one, you actually care about the fate of the characters, their motivations are clear and make sense, which renders the final battle more interesting. This Godzilla has all the elements, the giant creatures, the embattled humans, the ""son of dead scientist"" fighting for his life and the lives of countless others. Him randomly meeting a lost child in the subway, an incredibly clumsy device, the child's parents surviving the attack of the mutos, without apparently messing up their clothes or hair... and then we have the deal breaker (at least for me), this IED expert whose job is to defuse bombs gets on an aircraft and becomes an instant expert in the HALO jump? Pardon me? The biggest problem is that the bits of humanity that happen in the gaps between CGI are not long enough for us to get much of a handle on the characters, and the general level of unfocused-ness about the plot makes it very hard to care about their ultimate fate. The actors do their best, but ultimately, when I got up to leave at the end, I didn't feel invested in the outcome. Big, noisy, but curiously detached and despite the huge set pieces not actually that thrilling. Disappointed."

"BRoz123","10","1","4","9 June 2014"," Godzilla(2014) Movie Review
","Godzilla(2014) is directed by Gareth Edwards, starring Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Bryan Cranston, and Ken Watanabe. In this film, Godzilla is matched up against other dangerous creatures that threaten the existence of mankind. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Bryan Cranston play father and son who try to get to the bottom of what happened at a power plant roughly 15 years earlier. They uncover something much bigger and deadlier than they imagined. I was incredibly hyped for this movie when I first saw the trailers. The movie looked absolutely incredible and I am sad to say it is not incredible, but it is still a good movie. First, the positives: The tone of the movie was great, very dark, gritty and realistic(for a monster movie). Bryan Cranston was fantastic in the movie and the only character I truly cared about. He displayed his true acting talent and made me actually feel bad for everything that happened to him. Godzilla and the other monsters looked fantastic and incredibly real and menacing. Many people complain that Godzilla is too stocky but I do not believe so. The ending was also very well done and I enjoyed it. The visuals of course were the most impressive part of the movie. Now the negatives: Almost all of the characters displayed no emotion so even when they were in grave danger, I did not really care. If you are going to include 80 minutes of plot on humans in a monster movie, it better keep my attention. But, ""Godzilla"" did not. Also, there was not enough Godzilla in this movie. I understand they did not want to show too much until the epic climax but even five to ten more minutes of fighting would have kept this movie more interesting. So, aside from the poor characters, a somewhat weak script,and hardly any Godzilla, this movie was good and I recommend seeing it,even though it is not perfect. But what movie is?"
"JPfanatic93","7","1","4","8 June 2014"," The Big G returns with a vengeance
","You can't keep a classic monster down. And so it is with Godzilla. Toho hasn't released a new Gojira flick of its own ever since his big 50th anniversary showdown Final Wars in 2004. As the Big G is turning 60 this year, it seemed about time to revamp him once more. This time, the director's chair was given to somebody who had experience balancing human drama and monster action, Gareth Edwards. His take on the giant behemoth makes for one of the finest Godzilla movies yet, but it also frustratingly illustrates just how little you can do with the character.<br/><br/>Thematically, Godzilla has always been an obvious case of 'man versus nature' and this time proves no different. Man's folly playing with powers (usually atomic) beyond his control that end up wrecking civilization has been a prime franchise message since day one, but as it has been a decade since it was last sent to audiences, this is as good a time as any to reapply it to Godzilla's latest origin story. However, Edwards opts to focus most of the plot's attention not on examining Godzilla's existence, but his foe's instead. This story thread is interwoven with the fate of the Brody family. Living in Japan in 1999, Joe and his wife work at a Japanese nuclear power plant, where things soon go awry, leading to the plant's destruction and Sandra's dramatic death. The area is soon declared a quarantine zone, but Joe can't stop investigating the events of that fateful day for the next 15 years, alienating him from his son Ford, bland and forgetful Aaron Taylor-Johnson.<br/><br/>When his father causes trouble with his illegal excursions into the forbidden zone, the now adult Ford indulges him to present his case. Their father-son bonding trip into the zone makes for a haunting return to their old house in a now rundown city. News imagery of the Fukushima area in the wake of the tsunami and the nuclear disaster that followed is successfully evoked by the ruined town set to give this Godzilla movie a 21st century update that accordingly makes it feel sufficiently current and underscores Godzilla's themes still claim merit. The Fords are confronted with the 'MUTO', a giant insectoid creature, that has laid dormant for countless ages, but is now waking up. And all the military might in the world is not gonna stop it from following its natural instincts to feed on atomic energy and procreate. To the latter end, it has signaled a wake-up call to its mate and the two beasties proceed to hook up, likely to humanity's demise.<br/><br/>Edwards spends quite some time setting up the MUTO's motivations and the plight of the Ford family, soon making you ask a pertinent question: where is Godzilla? There is surprisingly little scenes of the actual Godzilla in this movie, but when he finally does appear, he does so with a vengeance. The giant reptile is the MUTO's natural enemy of ages past and as one big bug called the other, so too their predator woke up to find its prey, as expert Dr. Serizawa (Hollywood's obligatory Japanese actor, Ken Watanabe) explains, while donning a foreboding look of concern that irritatingly stays for the entire film. The name Serizawa will sound familiar to Godzilla aficionados, and is just one of many tidbits Edwards has lovingly thrown in as an homage to the Japanese movies. The MUTO's, however, are a new invention specifically for this film, but they serve their purpose adequately for resurrecting Godzilla and providing a good old-fashioned Kaiju brawl. Just like the Godzilla themes of old have hardly changed, so too does the audience's taste for monster battles remain, as Edwards all too clearly understands. It just takes quite a while to arrive at that point in the film where the fight finally goes down. We have to sit through many a scene of human character drama that ultimately doesn't make us really care about their plight before we get what we want. Though patience is required, it cannot be denied that the introduction of both Godzilla and his adversaries is slowly but surely built to a crescendo. When he finally does appear for the first time, it will be hard for fans to repress a chill at this reunion with their old friend.<br/><br/>It's clear Edwards sees no point in redefining Godzilla's look, as this new incarnation of Godzilla stays rather true to the recognizable Japanese forms. Of course, this being a big blockbuster movie, the beast has grown in size considerably to accommodate the humongous budget. Edwards' respect for the classic Kaiju movie approach of men in suits playing the monsters shows, as you'd almost be inclined to think Godzilla is brought to life again in just that manner. Even the MUTO's motions seem human at times, but make no mistake: all three monsters are fully digital creations. Nevertheless, Edwards' ode to sixty years of 'suitmation' is appreciated. Still, the notable differences in Godzilla's appearance compared to his predecessors, particularly his obese bodily features, are bound to tick off some fans.<br/><br/>Unjustly so, as this Godzilla, both the execution of the titular character and the movie as a whole, form a vast improvement over the previous American capitalization of the Japanese property. In terms of story Edwards adds little novelty to the previous fifty years of Gojira. The message remains the same, as does the usual tendency towards flat human character development interspersed between delightful monster battles. There's only so much you can do with a giant monster. However, as this movie demonstrates, times haven't changed enough for the cautions against man's tampering with nature to subside, nor has the audience changed enough they can't appreciate a good ol' monster clash on the big screen. Even if the upcoming sequels fail to deliver new directions for the franchise, Godzilla has enough of a fight left in him for another fifty years."
"pryan065","4","1","4","2 June 2014"," I Recommend Another Show
","The movie was disappointing. I was looking forward to the film and I thought it would be good, especially with Bryan Cranston. The beginning credits interested me as I soon discovered that they were the best part of the movie. Bryan Cranston can only be seen as Walter in Breaking Bad as his purpose in this movie was to ruin it. He ended up dying within the first 20 minutes and his son, along with the other bad actors, continued the movie. The best actor was the kid on the train who said nothing. The movie should have involved Godzilla and Godzilla only. The Muto's made the movie stupid especially with their EMP powers. One of them was seen eating a nuclear bomb. It simply broke it in half and began to swallow it whole. It would have exploded,but maybe he EMPed it? Personally I think that anything within a ten mile radius of Godzilla or either of the Muto's should die from the amount of radiation they eat. Again I am disappointed by the poor acting and plot. The movie just used a lot of money on CGI. I was not a big fan of Pacific Rim, but I strongly recommend it instead of Godzilla."
"crowley-4","4","1","4","31 May 2014"," What a waste of time and talent
","I should say at the outset that I am 43 years old so not exactly the target market for this film.<br/><br/>I felt sorry for Ken Watanabe whose scenes involved furrowing his brow and mumbling nonsense about the power of nature. I also felt sorry for David Strathairn - a good actor who had nothing to do in his scenes as an admiral.<br/><br/>Well done to all those involved in the making of this film who earned money from it, and congratulations to the special effect wizards who brought the creatures to life. I love seeing 'believable' massive creatures on screen, having grown up in the era of 'men in suit' and stop-motion monsters.<br/><br/>But I don't enjoy watching films that glorify the (usually American) military machine, and those that make a mockery of science (Prometheus, Independence Day, etc.). This film does both, while the script is the worst I have heard since 'Predators'. I didn't care about the characters or feel there was much excitement, and left the cinema feeling that no one has really done a scary monster story properly since Alien."

","So, yesterday I went to see this and X-Men. Good times, I rarely get to indulge my inner critic like that. I've reviewed a few movies on this site now, so I think it's fair to let everyone in on how I come up with my star ratings. I assign 5 stars to story and 5 stars to production value. The original Die Hard would get at least a 9 star rating from me using that criteria, for example. Now, on to the main event!<br/><br/>A lot of work went into the making of this film and it shows. When the monsters show up, you truly need surround sound to appreciate the cacophony that goes along with it. You've got the screaming of terrified onlookers, gunfire, explosions, the heavy footsteps of creatures that weigh thousands of tons, crumbling buildings, even rushing water. Godzilla himself looks like he has been eating at McDonald's for a few years, but it was satisfying to see him realized in such detail. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, that takes a back seat to the human element and that's where I had to knock off some stars. I'll give an example of what I mean. The very first time the audience gets a clear look at Godzilla, he looks inconceivably irate at this other monster, roars at it and...smash cut to a little boy watching the fight on television without any of that concussive noise the audience had grown to appreciate. By the way, that kid was awful. He seemed more like a stage prop, especially in that scene where his mother tells him repeatedly to turn off the TV until he goes: 'Look, mom! Dinosaurs!' No. Let's try that again with an actual kid who would probably pull their mom's arm off (to say nothing of her poor ear drums) trying to drag her over to see this miraculous news coverage.<br/><br/>Remember how heavily featured Bryan Cranston was in the trailers? Well, he has about 20 minutes of screen time. Sorry! The story, if you can call it that, is about his son who I'm going to call Breaking Bad Jr. because I don't remember his name. He's trying to get home to his wife and plank of wood son. That's about it. I wouldn't complain, except this is the focus of the movie. Godzilla himself is more like a background event and--uh-oh. It's time to play my favorite game! Wtf, Movie?!<br/><br/>The male and female cockroach creatures supposedly evolved to feed on radiation, so why do they have teeth? Wtf, Movie?!<br/><br/>Godzilla is said to hunt these things, but he never eats them after killing them. Wtf, Movie?!<br/><br/>Godzilla is the title character of the movie, but he has less screen time than Breaking Bad Jr. who I personally found it hard to care about because he and his family are extremely bland. Wtf, Movie?!<br/><br/>They study the male cockroach by feeding it radiation while it's gestating, then they are positively SHOCKED that this could cause trouble even though they could have killed it at any point before then with electricity. Do they not know how an autopsy works? Wtf, Movie?!<br/><br/>Godzilla should have been the focus of this movie, is all I'm saying. When he killed the male cockroach with a swipe of his tail, I (who had been utterly silent up until this point of the movie) abruptly stood up and shouted in the middle of a crowded theater: 'Hell yeah! Hit em again!' 6 out of 10 and 6 of those stars come from Godzilla vomiting atomic fire down the female cockroach's throat. On to X-Men!"
"lucasnochez","2","1","4","27 May 2014"," Film Review: Godzilla/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","In 2010, director Gareth Edwards made his way to the festival scene by ways of Monsters, a eco- centric, sci-fi hit that introduced audiences to the wonders of large scale destruction and monsters mixed with the small scale effects of the individual characters as well as making a name for the extremely talented Scoot McNairy (12 Years A Slave, Non-Stop). Think District 9 with monsters instead of aliens. Fast forward four years later, thanks to the critical success of his first full length indie feature, and Edwards, who has been given the keys to the commercial kingdom, is front and centre in adapting the King of Monsters in only the second Americanized version since the abysmal yet highly popcorn-crunchingly entertaining Godzilla remake from Roland Emmerich from 1998. Entrusted with a massive $160 million dollar budget from Warner Bros. Pictures, after acquiring the rights of the iconic beast from Toho in 2010, Edwards proves that Godzilla reigns at destroying one thing, and one thing only, the promise of young filmmakers career's. <br/><br/>Godzilla is a large beast to discuss in one review or twenty-seven for that matter (since there has been about twenty-seven film adaptations of the beast) since his birth back in 1954. For his sixtieth birthday, Godzilla has been given the royal treatment, having its largest budget to date, a strong international cast, and the biggest presence on screen thanks to a belief that bigger is better. That belief is shot down with the help of this film. With screens growing in size (IMAX, AVX, etc.), ticket prices getting a radioactive hike and the God of Monsters terrorizing cities solely based on its sheer size, something's gotta give, but never does.<br/><br/>For the first time in the creature's existence, Godzilla is not the centre of attention. In fact, the monster itself only makes up for mere minutes of the film. Adopting a very Nolan-esque, if not J.J Abrams approach to minimizing the beast's reveal before the film's premiere and within the film, Edwards focuses less on the destruction of Godzilla, and more on the presence monsters have on a small group of people on earth. Basically, a rehashing of Edwards' Monsters, with a much bigger budget.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Edwards, instead of keeping his vision and artistic integrity intact, he decides to allow Hollywood, and the symbol of Godzilla himself, to consume him, into something I like to call, the symptoms of a Hollywood film. Edwards succumbs to; foggy glass shots where characters wipe their windows for a big reveal at the monster; children noticing things before adults, monsters and rain (lots of it) and my favourite, crazy guy who proves us all that he wasn't crazy. Godzilla is one big 'told ya so', when the summer blockbuster season is a large example of so many times we go into a film, hoping to be surprised, but being delivered exactly what we expected instead.<br/><br/>Like any other huge blockbuster film recently (see: The Watchmen, X: Men First Class, The Wolverine), the film begins to explain the origins of the giant lizard, this time dating it back to radioactive testings done in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the 1940′s. Deep rooted in one of the most tragic time's in our world's history, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Wantanabe) explains how the radioactive bombs were done less as a test, and more of a means to destroy the unexplained and mysterious creature found deep in the ocean. Unknown to scientists then, but the monstrosity fed off the radiation being used, making it stronger as opposing to killing it. Since his disappearance, the God of Creatures has since been absent from the world. Until, in 1999, when engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston in his most annoying role yet) experiences the devastation of electrical shocks taking out the power at his radioactive plant, that leads to chaos and causes him to lose his wife Sandra Brody (Juliette Binoche) and many of his co-workers. Left to raise his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) alone, Ford grows up becoming a bomb specialist for the United States Army (how appropriate), distancing his father from his family due to his obsession with the mysteries of the events the day his wife was taken from him. Fifteen years later and after returning after fourteen months on tour, Ford returns to San Francisco to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and his son Sam (Carson Bolde), only to be summoned by his father for some unfinished business that might lead the end of the world as we know it.<br/><br/>The summer movie season has recently been infamous for spewing out relentless amounts of superhero films and unexpected heroes. Godzilla is no different than any of these films, finding an unlikely hero in the process of ripping the essence of the ferocity and symbolic destructive nature that is Godzilla. One of the biggest problems of this adaptation of Godzilla lies in the dubious marketing tactics for the film. In an early Comic Con trailer, the narration of the trailer suggests the creature's odious nature and pleasure with destruction. Based on earlier interpretations of the monster, these hints of originality and authenticity of the creature are not kept or upheld with any dignity at all for the iconic cinematic figure, instead thrown on its head and butchered."
"YetAnotherMovieReviewer","4","1","4","26 May 2014"," Not Worth the Praise
","Why Godzilla (2014) Sucks There are several elements to why this movie was terrible and to see why we'll begin with some of the major problems. Okay so you've decided to hold back the creature till the last half an hour of the movie where we finally see it fight and you want to showcase the human drama behind the movie. Aside from the fact this disappointed me as a sucker of monster movies and you primarily came here for the monster (which is a preference admittedly although your trailer advertises it specifically as that type of movie) that approach will only work if the human drama is worth giving a s**t for and in this film it isn't. Comparing this to Jaws which held back the creature to the very end, the reason why that worked and you weren't angry is because you actually gave a s**t about this very likable characters that had meaningful issues and development behind them. The only likable character here is Bryan Cranston's who plays it phenomenally and again shows why he is a great actor. When you kill off such a character early in the film and leave the film to depend on a character who's undeveloped and flat, the audience no longer is invested into the film and that's what happened here. If you're going to kill off such a character in a twist the audience might not expect, which we didn't, you need to have supporting characters to fill in that void and this film didn't have those. Looking at sally Hawkins, after seeing her in Blue Jasmine you know she's a fantastic actress but now you have here being reduced down to purely an ex-positional character, she has no character arc whatsoever or any personality. You have Ken Watanabe again who's there as an ex-positional character who has a slighter more developed side. You can see he gives a little s**t about Godzilla but when you have him for the whole movie doing the same dumb founded confused expression it's hard for the audience to see any character within him.literally. Now moving on to the main supporting lead in Aaron Taylor-Johnson, he does not have the likability or personality to hold up the audiences invested because he does not have the character arc to do so. There's no real emotion in what he's doing, OK so he won't be emotional after his father's death because 15 years ago he experienced the same tragedy with his mum. Fine, reasonable to assume since he knows how to distance himself. But then what other emotion is he going to show? He seems to care for his family but the movie doesn't provide enough investment to it. He makes a phone call to his wife and that's it. Like really. Why do you give a s**t about stopping Godzilla and how are we meant to give a s**t if you don't. I'm using a basic clichéd example of some emotional investment but at least it's something.<br/><br/>Now moving on from the characters the things in the movie that distract you or remove you from being within the moment on what's on screen. Having Godzilla pop up for the first time and then cutting to a TV screen of the news showing the fight with s**tty dialog placed over it. And doing this once is bad enough but twice, really. What it does is instead of firstly showing the fights in the trailer and most audiences expected come to see, secondly removes the god like aspect of the film. You instead see these figures of giants reduced down into a TV screen when you could be panning the camera to see the fight in all its glory. Secondly, so Joe is arrested for trespassing in the quarantined area and his son who's in San Francisco is the only one who can travel to japan to assist him? Thirdly, Joe gets arrested inside the quarantined zone and this time for whatever reason the guards accept his request to see the secret facility that holds one of the creatures? Like what happened to last time and locking him up in prison. Forget about cause he said he used to work here? Fourth, you send Joe to Hawaii for some reason? Fifth, so you found out that your plan to keep the mu-to under control with radiation that you're feeding but realized this didn't work out and then instead it grew and fed off the radiation for which you realized was its power. So why didn't you communicate this with the other scientists who were looking after the second mu-to baby that was supposedly dormant inside a f**king radiation hot spot. Really you don't think it's important to note that? And why was sally Hawkins so surprised it woke up because the scientist said it was dormant? Um hello, I'm not even a scientist but dormant doesn't mean f**king dead why this such a surprise is. Sixth, so you've invested a massive mega ton nuclear warhead that you claim to say has not been seen before and nothing will withstand its force. Obviously we know this won't work against monsters as the film wants u to see that we need to rely on Godzilla as the hero. But when it detonates right next to a city (which conveniently happens to be where Ford's wife and son live) there's no f**king way any person could of survived that. Yet the cliché return of reuniting Ford and his wife happens and its bull$hit.<br/><br/>Things like this hold back the movie that has such great special effects behind it. The creature design is amazingly good looking and the sound of it is fantastic (though they may have milked it a bit too much).

","I've been a Godzilla fan since 1975. I've been waiting for a good modern Godzilla remake. This is not it. The number one complaint is what everyone else is saying... Godzilla has NO screen time. This director is terrible. Everyone says his earlier movie ""Monsters"" is amazing, but in that movie you barely even see any monsters, and the director continues the tradition with this movie. Well, you do get to see monsters, they're just not Godzilla... the name of the movie is GODZILLA, not GODZILLA'S ENEMIES. You can tell this was totally intentional. You just keep waiting for a monster fight and they tease you twice throughout the movie (once by showing you brief moments of a fight on news footage, the next when they start fighting and the doors are literally closed on the view). It's absolutely stupid. The director thinks he's being all clever by teasing the audience. I just kept thinking they BETTER pay off at the end. There is a fight at the end but it's fairly brief and not very epic. Godzilla is ALL about the fights. They really blew it here. Also, this movie is SO poorly written. There are so many logical issues I was distracted by them. All I kept thinking was how does a story with so many problems get green-lit? I can't remember seeing a movie in recent times that was so lazily written. The budget was spent on the CGI, which is top notch, but the story suffers. So if you like beefcakes or blondes, this movie may be for you. All beauty and no brains. True Godzilla fans will be sorely disappointed in his lack of screen time, lack of battle scenes, and the absolutely terrible writing."
"newsfop","6","1","4","24 May 2014"," Exceeded My Low Expectations
","I qualify this review as someone who enjoys movies and critiques them on a case-by-case basis. I have a working knowledge of the original films by Toho mostly through other reviewers like James Rolfe. I never grew up with the originals, so my understanding for the phenomena of kaiju was limited. <br/><br/>Coming into this movie though I was anxious to see what would come of the work and devotion to the past, and I was for the most part pleased with what I saw. The portrayals of the main family in their efforts to stay in contact were well done. That storyline often carried some emotional weight that I don't often see in a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>I liked the creature design on Godzilla and the M.U.T.O.s. I thought they showed true menace and were quite threatening. I only wish that I could have seen more discussion and portrayal of the titular character. Godzilla showing up halfway through a two-and-a-half-hour movie creates a bit of anxiety. And for a film that's supposed to be kicking off a new series, it really does very little to attempt to talk about the where and why of the giant lizard.<br/><br/>When I did get to see Godzilla though, I wasn't disappointed. All the elements that made him an intense fighting force were there made even better by grounded motion capture performance and trademark radioactive breath put to good use.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling good, and that's better than I could have hoped for."
"gonzo1207","3","1","4","23 May 2014"," Not what i hoped...
","My initial gut reaction after seeing the first trailer for Godzilla was one of skepticism and cynicism. Especially after seeing the part showing a bunch of troops getting ready to HALO jump right into monster's location. For me, that was the big warning sign to avoid this movie. Why? Because the last thing you do when there is a giant monster below you destroying a city, is parachute down into the area with nothing but a rifle. To me, this screamed ""cheesy excuse to film a dramatic parachute jump into the mouth of madness."" In reality, it's lazy writing and as a result, has no impact whatsoever. All I could think is ""what an idiotic and suicidal thing to do."" Showing a scene like this in the trailer also seems desperate. Seeing it happen in the movie just reinforced this. <br/><br/>For some reason or other (great marketing? Bryan Cranston?) I went against my gut feeling and decided to check this movie out and judge it for myself. I'd read a couple reviews beforehand and many seemed pretty positive. Some critics complained but what movie doesn't have a million critics complaining about something these days? Well... Unfortunately I'm now one of those critics. <br/><br/>It seemed like 2 different movies to me. The first half was actually interesting and did a decent job of building up excitement and providing a back story of where the giant monsters came from and what they wanted. I think one of the major problems with the film was the tempo. It really takes its time in the beginning which is good, but then it stays at that slow pace all the way through to the end and unfortunately the monster action isn't really all that exciting once you see it. Most of the fight scenes are very dark and the MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms) look like cheap kids toys from a happy meal. Godzilla is cool but has no personality. He's just a big lumbering cgi lizard with no point to his existence. In the end i had major buyer's remorse. The movie becomes very cliché and predictable and ends up making me yawn and regret the fact that I paid good money and took 2.5 hours of my life to actually watch it. In the end I was very disappointed in the movie and should have watched XMEN instead. I will avoid the inevitable trilogy like the plague. Goes to show sometimes the negative reviews are true..."

Cant compare with the classic dinosaur movies of earlier times. <br/><br/>Dr. Ishiro Serizawa had hardly any role. Ford Brody's role was quite satisfying . Over all the movie is pretty mediocre .

","Godzilla should be one of my top movies in my list yet the trailer looks dark and getting deeper which I lost interest at some point. <br/><br/>I did watch it and it was good. It's kind of the movie that i will not gonna watch again. I'm a fan of Godzilla in animated series. Lots of giant monsters and stuffs. The version of this Godzilla is mixed of that cartoon and the new one. The monsters are feeding radiation and nuclear components which based on my point of view were gaining them these special talents. As far as I remember, Godzilla has sonic scream that cause explosions but in here, he can blast blue fire or energy flame.<br/><br/>The appearance isn't that fascinating. He is bulky like the original Godzilla. I prefer the looks of the previous Godzilla movie. What I like was there is not just one monster in the film. There are three of them and it's a rumble every time they met.<br/><br/>I can say its 80% conversation and 20% action. That's how boring it was for me. But still most people love it, but not me. I still like the first version of Godzilla, this version has only an awesome effects, but not entertaining."
"Seraphion","6","1","4","20 May 2014"," A good movie, but it should work more on the monster department.
","The story follows the Bordy family. Joe Brody lost his wife in a radiation accident in a nuclear plant in Japan. Years later his son Ford, an army bomb specialist, joins him in Japan to uncover the truth about that accident. It's revealed that a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism (MUTO) that eats out radiation caused that accident and cocooned there the past years. Now the MUTO then spring out of its cocoon causing another accident wounding Joe. The researcher Serizawa brings Joe and Ford to get more data. Joe doesn't survive and Ford goes to Hawaii to head home to San Francisco. The MUTO snapped a Russian submarine and placed it there. Godzilla emerged to fight the MUTO but it escaped. The monsters are no more secrets.<br/><br/>The MUTO is tracked to be going to US soil. Serizawa informs the army there is another MUTO in Nevada, that turns out to be the female. The female MUTO then springs out of its dormancy, obliterating Las Vegas. The army goes with a plan of luring the MUTOs and Godzilla with nuclear bombs. The plan botched because the female MUTO chomped on the train carrying them and snacked on one bomb. Ford and the other bomb is scooped by the army. The army then sets up the remaining bomb time to lure the monsters somewhere near the SF coast. But the MUTO again snapped it and bring it to their nest, in downtown SF. Godzilla emerges right beside Golden Gate being and the soldiers attacked it. The bridge is damaged because of the incident. Soon the two MUTOs have a showdown with Godzilla. The army sends a team HALO jumping to disarm or move them bomb away from people.<br/><br/>Ford and the team finds the nest. Seeing the eggs they rigged to blow the nest. The explosion panicked the female MUTO, giving a second take for the losing Godzilla, that eventually kills the MUTOs. Gdzilla then drops down as if its dead, but as the day breaks, it awakens and heads back to the ocean.<br/><br/>The base story is better from the last Godzilla adaptation back in 1998. The quite complex story forces the pace to be more of a jog than a walk on the earlier parts. Unfortunately there is no pace variation and the ending doesn't fell as epic as it should.<br/><br/>There's much controversy about the movie's overall quality. Many comment on Godzilla's new look. I personally agree to the unsatisfied comments. Godzilla looks strange, if not stupid, in this movie. The character design gives back Godzilla's more original shaping from the Japanese origin with a much bigger posture. Guess it's not only currencies that get inflated.<br/><br/>The fact that some scenes show the iconic monster from not so alluring angles just do worse to the look. The leg shot, now that Godzilla has pretty much scaly elephant legs, is just awful. The bridge scene looks like Godzilla clumsily tangled it's hand onto the cables.<br/><br/>Godzilla's foes the MUTOs are well planned and executed. The design doesn't stray much from the original monsters but not specifically too Japanese. On the early promotions, some media even mistakenly wrote the MUTO as Mutou, presuming them as some Japanese monster name.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the monster fight scenes are stupid, if not suck. The daytime face-off is all too same to other monsters or mecha battle scenes with airborne entities. One flying foe will go and perch on one building, obliterating some parts of it, and taunts. There is not new thing offered here.<br/><br/>The real monster fight is just stupid because it's done in night time. It's just like the movie's crew didn't even try to give a better fight scene on daytime. Also the fights are not well documented because there is insufficient environmental lighting to cover the fight like for example in Pacific Rim (2013).<br/><br/>The acting is overall a so-so. Bryan Cranston acts well although sometimes he gets a bit overacting. Elizabeth Olsen doesn't really shine compared to her last take on Oldboy (2013). Juliette Binoche did quite a good job playing her so-so role while Ken Watanabe doesn't really shine due to his role that is not so much challenging<br/><br/>On the other hand Aaron Taylor Johnson did a great adaptation since his last Kick-Ass role. Besides managing to get his body buffed up well, he also manages to land a safe performance on his role, although in my opinion he must use his facial expressions better.<br/><br/>For me, The movie is indeed a recommendable watch. But for the score, it's a 6 out of 10 from me, due to the critical disappointments on the monster department."

","After months of nonstop hype, the newest Godzilla movie has finally hit theaters. As a big fan of the original film, I was willing to give them a chance, which was hard after the 1998 American reboot. While that film was a giant mess, this film was amazing.<br/><br/>Directed by Gareth Edwards, director of Monsters, and one of my favorite documentaries In the Shadow of the Moon, delivers an amazing action film. If you are expecting a perfectly developed film with a perfect story, you simply are not going to get it. Frankly the original film didn't delivery in that department either. It had a simple idea and ran with it. Same thing in this film. Of course Godzilla was going to be CGIed in the film, can't use those puppets anymore, and Godzilla still looks amazing. Much better than the last attempt at creating Godzilla. The action scenes are amazing. Top notch, and best of all, the final battle is at least ten minutes I would say. The actors generally work and fit well together, and I would say the acting was top notch. Bryan Cranston was amazing. A little hard to get use to him again with hair after Breaking Bad, but his acting was amazing. Elizabeth Olsen was a gem to watch. She is one of the top actresses today. Ken Watanabe, a legendary actor, was fabulous to watch in this film, a real treat. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is probably the only actor I would give a barely above average rating to.<br/><br/>The film was written by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham. Dave Callaham is known for his writing of the Expendable franchise. Much like that franchise the action was big in the film, especially towards the end, and he deserves credit for bringing in those ideas to the film. The overall story of the film is fairly basic. These gentlemen aren't going to win an Oscar, but they do stick together the film nicely overall.<br/><br/>The film was composed by Alexandre Desplat, and I must say as a huge fan of movie scores, this was very good. Not perfect, and likely won't win any awards, but top shelf no doubt about it.<br/><br/>Overall this is without a doubt a must see film of Summer 2014. Big epic action, that is worth it in every aspect, and watching this film in IMAX is even better. The thunderous surround sound of the IMAX really shows off how amazing the film really is. As for the 3D, it was not anything to write home about. It adds some depth to the images, and a few things come out towards the screen here and there, but the 3D itself could have been left out. So once again, go out and watch this film, it is well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>8/10"

It is a modern movie that tries to stay true to the nature of what Godzilla is and means, even though it is an Americanization of the franchise and that shows through at times.<br/><br/>This movie, like most Godzilla classics, starts out rather slow, throwing barely probable science at the watcher until the action starts. And to be fair, if I was looking at what they were looking at I'd probably chuck my science manuals out the window too. <br/><br/>Overall the monster fight scenes were just okay, but there were a few shining moments of awesome in there.

","As a long time Godzilla fan, the 98' movie was like an ice pick stabbed in my heart - horrible. Big G was reduced to a scared, gigantic iguana that ran around the city and got killed by a few missiles... yikes! Naturally when I heard about this one and watched the first trailers I was stunned, and my expectations were high - especially after just finishing the Breaking Bad series and expecting similar performance from Bryan Cranston ( Who, to my surprise, was not actually the main character of the movie - something that I thought after watching the trailers). Although the director himself is still quite inexperienced and I hated his latest ''Monsters'' movie, I thought he may be able to pull this off properly.<br/><br/>However, unlike the awesome trailers, the movie doesn't really deliver the same ''feeling'', and too much of the runtime focuses on the human characters, very little on big G himself. There are several scenes where my inner fanboy took the better of me, and my heart literally started pounding in my chest ( the first full reveal of the G himself - truly stunning), and the CGI effects and design of the various beasts were commendable, however the movie is seriously lacking in most other areas. The movie is thus watchable, but ( apart from a few really stunning Godzilla scenes), unfortunately doesn't quite live up to it's name, or hype."

","No Spoilers - I watched the movie yesterday and boy was I disappointed. I am not sure if I am the only one out there but I just had to speak my mind. <br/><br/>To be honest, I went to watch the movie with high expectations (above 7 rating on IMDb does mean something) but I was utterly disappointed. To start with, It is a Godzilla Movie, where, you will not see the beast enough. I mean out of 2 Hours in the cinema we witnessed the beast on the screen for around 20 minutes max...... I mean come on.... I remember looking at my watch in the middle of the movie, may be after 1.5 hours thinking Is it really going to end this way? I mean its about to end and still we didn't see enough of Godzilla?????? The story line was okay, but to witness the action and as it was the most anticipated movie, I just feel rating it above 5.5 will be unfair for the fans who would like to see the massive creature on their cinema screens. I don't want to compare but I remembered Peter Jackson's King Kong that came out in 2005, while I was sitting there, I would like to add that, that movie was something, the details, the clarity was astonishing. I came home placed my Blu-ray in the drive and watched King Kong, while the details flew out of my screen and filled my hunger with its powerful and strong presence. <br/><br/>It is really up to you if you still want to go and see it for yourself, I just felt that if I had read something like this before I went to see this movie, I would've saved my money and would've stayed home. I would not recommend it, even if you have nothing playing in your local cinemas, I would ask you to save your money. Rest - this is what I felt. The story too was unsatisfying for me. Take care guys and if I interpreted the movie wrong or if I missed something then I apologize. Take care you all and Happy movie watching :)"

At least the Americans did not follow 1998 mistakes...sort of. As a film company I guess they would be happy - it is sort of better than the real Godzilla movies...but come on, this does not really work as well as the real Godzilla movies, as hard as it is to be honest.<br/><br/>Humans and screen time for the star are going to be a problem, and what one person thinks is a monster another could disagree - bankers need solid agreement for the money needed, I can see that - but well really kinda missed on monsters - MUTO...? Eyes, mouth/face? Loving parents? Parasitic insects could look more like insects and I would be happier. Not just saying this to ruin the movie. The kids will want more screen time for Godzilla, shoot it looks like many reviewers do also...but then there won't be any talking lol. (who would say 2 hours of monsters only battles would be a bad thing?) I really was not emotionally connected to the humans, probably because I came to watch Godzilla. But there was enough emotion to go around.<br/><br/>The SF Chronicle reviewer could not understand watching stuff being stepped on or crushed as they walked or fought - but well it was so well done!

"infernalaffairs1980","7","1","4","17 May 2014"," Is Godzilla still the King?
","Directed - Gareth Edwards Starring - Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Ken Watanabe In 1954 the Toho Film Company made a picture about a huge dinosaur-like monster that rampaged through Tokyo. It was only 93 minutes long but it spawned a legend that has lasted 60 years and 28 (Japanese) films. I am, of course, referring to the colossus that is Godzilla.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2014 and the newest incarnation of the world's most famous kaiju. Godzilla is an icon and the director, Gareth Edwards, had a mammoth task to overcome; how to bring the monster into the 21st Century without angering the fans.<br/><br/>The film begins with some original opening credits; words are redacted before the viewers' eyes, leaving only the names of the cast. This plays out over footage, supposedly from the 1950s, showing radars, military personnel and, finally, a large nuclear explosion at Bikini Atoll (the first of many references to actual events and /or classic Godzilla movies ).<br/><br/>We jump to 1999 and meet Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) who is investigating the skeleton of a large, prehistoric creature found in the Philippines. Then we zoom over to Japan where Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is concerned about the nuclear plant where he works. Disaster obviously ensues and what follows is a sequence reminiscent of the Fukushima disaster which occurred only a few years ago.<br/><br/>And now we are up to date. Joe's son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is happily living in San Francisco with his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and young son.<br/><br/>At this point I would like to say that I was slightly disturbed at watching these two young actors playing lovers as, in my head, they are the Maximoff siblings (I know, I know, it's not real but I can still have my opinion).<br/><br/>Father and son are eventually reunited and that's where the action really begins.<br/><br/>Cranston is brilliant as a father who feels like he has lost it all; both traumatised and unhinged in equal measure. Watanabe is the yin to Cranston's yang; calm and collected to a point where some of his dialogue is barely above a whisper.<br/><br/>The younger actors; Taylor-Johnson and Olsen, are not as strong in their roles. Olsen is not given much to do except cry and run. In fact, one downside of this movie is that there is a distinct lack of strong female characters.<br/><br/>Taylor-Johnson has a larger part to play but he doesn't quite fulfil the leading man role. He isn't entirely convincing as an action star but neither plausible as desperate family man. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a good actor but he wasn't given enough to work with. The script is basic with Cranston's impassioned ranting (heard in the trailer) as the only stand out part.<br/><br/>But to most, it isn't the human cast that people care about. Does the 2014 version of Godzilla make the grade? In short, yes. He bears a resemblance to the original creature but without the look of a rubber suit. You could believe that there is a dinosaur-like monster out there. As you have probably gathered from the many trailers, Godzilla isn't the only kaiju in the movie but I will leave what they are, and why they are there, as a surprise.<br/><br/>And then there is THAT roar. Spine tingling with a bass deep enough to turn your internal organs to mush, perfect.<br/><br/>At several points in the film, just as the audience thinks it might be treated to a monster smackdown, the focus is always pulled back to the less interesting human story. However, the final battle is worth waiting for, if not a little short. Gareth Edwards has held enough back for the inevitable sequel (pending box office results).<br/><br/>There are small niggles here and there but I was always a fan of the King of Monsters (another classic reference) and there is enough here to remind us of the creature we fell in love with.<br/><br/>Bonus points if you spot the reference to another kaiju which appears in the first half of the film.<br/><br/>Rating - 7/10 www.silverscreensnob.blogspot.com"

","SPOILERS!!! Now, I have nothing wrong with an action film, in fact, I love them! But, with these big name actors that are known for their acting, I expected a little more drama to this film, rather than seeing a giant lizard try and fight a huge pregnant bat and its hubby for 2/3rds of the film. The acting from Cranston was brilliant though, from what it was anyway before he died pretty suddenly in a not so heroic way. In a way the story made a lot of sense and was clearly put in a lot of effort from the whole cast and crew, and many props to them for not actually killing off the big man himself, Godzilla of course not Taylor-Johnson. Overall, in a film where there was a lot of drama and not much acting, the money was well spent (all $160 million of it)And, well, if anyone deserves an award its Godzilla, that's all I'm gonna say on the matter."

","Well in my opinion this movie is being over rated, a 10? It wasn't terrible, but come on a 10? The subliminal messages for September 11th and other disasters puts it lower than that off the bat. I didn't know what to expect going into Godzilla. I was trying to be open minded. The roar from the trailer was the first thing I worried about, because it just doesn't sound quite right. That's a little detail, icing on the cake. Important but not the core of the movie's problems. The core of the movie's problem is that as a Godzilla film... it doesn't really have Godzilla. I didn't really expect that . Godzilla has about 20 -30 seconds in this 3 hour movie... literally. If you do a slow count, I think that is about right.<br/><br/>Count as slow as you want, it's a 3 hour movie. The movie itself isn't so bad, but because of the lack of Godzilla I give it a 7, as a movie that doesn't really have Godzilla... I didn't care for the other monsters either, it's just a weird plot , the two other monsters are male and female and getting jiggy with it... and do a head rub.... It was just weird, didn't work naturally for me. I would preferred if they had mothara and Gamera or something. But no they had two Cloverfield type monsters and showed them far more than they did Godzilla. Godzilla was barely in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie also focuses way too much on the military, most the film is the military defeating the monsters and fighting the monsters, trying to defeat the monsters and not Godzilla... at the end when Godzilla apparently gets tried of fighting he just grabs the monsters by the throat shoots his atomic breathe down their throat and rips their head off... The other one I think he just beats to death with a building and it's dead... that's pretty damn lame. Tag on that seeing the military more than we see Godzilla and September 11th subliminal messages... and you got a winner.What some people don't realize yet is that by watching a movie they are basically watching the news, whether it's about war, being a patriot or a politician's lying feel good speech or September 11th... it's all the same BS and now the subliminal messages are becoming appalling obvious in film. <br/><br/>Godzilla actually has no problem killing these monsters... there's no real fighting... The Japanese won't be taking any notes and we should have been taking many when writing the fight scenes for this turkey of a script. ( Not a terrible movie again, a 7 is being fair...) It's still too American, not Japanese enough. Stay away from Ultraman, USA please. ( I am American.) Also there is no Godzilla music, and the music they have is a cheesy hero theme that made me feel like they were making Godzilla like the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>It really feels like this movie was just to set things up for an possible American sequel film. Godzilla is barely in this movie.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible film, it's not as bad as the 1998 film, but it's still a miss from Japanese culture film and as Americans we really screwed up the fight scenes... The Japanese know how to make monster fight scenes like the Americans know how to make Rocky fight scenes.<br/><br/>We didn't do it justice, but it's not a horrible film. I rather watch Godzilla 2000, which was in American theaters when released. I give this movie a 7."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","4","16 May 2014"," Size matters
","It's not that there aren't other things in this movie worth talking about, but the most talked-about aspect must be the size of this latest rendition of the world's (here I venture a speculation) best known ""monster"" at its 60th birthday (or thereabout).<br/><br/>What Hollywood had done 15 years ago bastardizing this iconic Japanese folk hero is redeemed today. Godzilla is restored to the stature of a force of nature that, while formidable and potentially devastatingly destructive, provides a balance in savior-of-the-world proportions, in a titanic battle against a pair of fiendishly hideous-looking spider-based monsters.<br/><br/>As devastations of all kinds imaginable (and unimaginable) successively turn into rubbles Manila, Tokyo and Honolulu, our explosive-expert hero played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems to be caught in each and every one of these disasters while his lovely wife (Elizabeth Olsen) with their little kid awaits in San Francisco where the three creatures will eventually converge. From the Pacific, with small skirmishes along the way, come Godzilla and the male spider-like evil that can spread out wings like a pterodactyl. Emerging from the bowels of Nevada is his mate, the female with no wings but larger (almost as large as Godzilla). I'll leave you to guess what this pair is up to. I suppose one could fault Godzilla for this mischief of trying to spoil a good romance.<br/><br/>Filling roles that do not require their level of acting are four Oscar–caliber actors, three nominees and one award recipient, as listed below in chronological order. Juliette Binoche took home a supporting Oscar in 1997 for ""The English Patient"". In 2004, Ken Watanabe got a best supporting nomination for ""The last samurai"". Next came David Strathairn's best supporting nomination in 2006 for ""Good night, and good luck"". For this year's best supporting, Sally Hawkins got a nomination for ""Blue Jasmine"". But then, she made her mark in 2009, taking home best acting Golden Globe (comedy or musical) for ""Happy-go-lucky"".<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, it is the superb cinematography and special effect that make this movie worth seeing. And, of course, size."

","Since 1954 the King of the Monsters has appeared in many guises, with sequels good and bad from Japan and Hollwyood following, the only one I had seen previously was the rubbish 1998 Roland Emmerich version, I was most excited to see a new blockbuster movie to try and reignite the franchise, from director Gareth Edwards (Monsters). Basically the film opens with Bikini Atoll nuclear bomb test in 1954, before forwarding to 1999, where in a quarry in the Philippines scientists Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Inception's Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Blue Jasmine's Sally Hawkins) are called, there a colossal skeleton and two egg- shaped pods have been discovered, one of the eggs has hatched and whatever what was inside it has escaped to the sea. In Japan, seismic activity happens at the Janjira nuclear plant, supervisor Joe Brody (Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston) sends a team, including his wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche), into the core to inspect for damage, while this is going on an explosion occurs, radiation threatens the outside if released, Sandra and the team are unable to escape, the plant collapses, and an earthquake is caused after the disaster which results in the Janjira area being quarantined. Fifteen years later Joe is arrested trespassing in the quarantined area, his son Ford Brody (Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor-Johnson), an explosive ordnance disposal officer in the United States Navy, travels to Japan to sort his father out, but he is convinced to join his father into the closed off place, which is not radioactive at all, to return to their old home, to retrieve floppy disks containing vital information. They are captured after finding the disks they are taken a secret facility not far from the ruins of the power plant, Serizawa and Graham are there investigating a discovered chrysalis, a colossal butterfly like egg, and it soon hatches releasing a gigantic winged creature, later identified as a MUTO (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) that feeds off of radiation, it devastates the facility before flying off, Joe is mortally wounded and eventually dies. The creature is being tracked by the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CVN-88), commanded by US Navy Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn), but there is another creature that is hunting the MUTO, a much larger prehistoric monster named ""Godzilla"" that was awakened in 1954 by a deep sea expedition, it has been continually covered up during it's existence, with numerous failed attempts to kill it with nuclear weapons, and after information given by Ford about his father's information the scientists believe the MUTO was communicating with something else. The wreckage of a Russian nuclear submarine is found in a Hawaiin forest by a Special Forces team, and there the MUTO is feeding on it's reactor, a battle ensues at Honolulu International Airport, and Godzilla arrives and creates a devastating tsunami that hits Waikiki, but the MUTO flies, and meanwhile the second creature pod in the Phillipines hatches at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, and a much larger female MUTO escapes and destroys Las Vegas, Serizawa and Graham know that the two MUTO creatures will meet to breed. Stentz sees the only way to destroy all three monsters is to launch a powerful nuclear weapon on them when they reach San Francisco Bay, but the scientists have faith that Godzilla can destroy the MUTOs, a train with two warheads heads to the city, but the female monster stops it, and consumes one of the weapons, the other weapon is airlifted and armed on a boat in San Francisco, but this too is stolen by the male monster and given to the female to construct a nest. At the Golden Gate Bridge the military is defeated confronting Godzilla, so Stentz agrees to allow Godzilla to fight the MUTOs, and meanwhile Ford and and a team of soldiers must disarm the weapon in the nest, but is has been damaged and cannot be stopped, so instead the boat is moved out to sea, the next is destroyed by Ford, the male MUTO is killed by Godzilla being smashed into a skyscraper, and Godzilla appears to be crushed by the collapsing building. The female MUTO kills most of the team at the boat, but Godzilla returns and attacks it, firing his atomic breath down it's throat, decapitating her, and then Godzilla collapses, Ford sends the boar out to sea and is rescued before the weapon detonates, he is finally reunited with his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) and son Sam (Carson Bolde), Godzilla is praised by the media as ""King of the Monsters"" and the ""The City's Savior"", the monster unexpectedly awakens, lets out one last roar, before returning to the sea. Also starring Richard T. Jones as Captain Russell Hampton, Victor Rasuk as Sergeant Tre Morales, Patrick Sabongui as Lieutenant Commander Marcus Waltz and CJ Adams as Young Ford. The cast is certainly full of well known stars, Taylor-Johnson is alright as the one trying to save the day, Cranston indeed makes an impression as the mad but correct theorist, Strathairn plays the strategist well, Watanabe gets his moments knowing all about the monsters, and Binoche should have been on for longer, but I will agree the human characters are not what draws you. The stars of the picture are indeed the monsters, the reptilian Godzilla and the scary winged MUTO creatures, this is a definite return to classic routes, not just seeing the super-sized monster destroying cities, but where he battles with other monsters, so the fantastic special effects come thick and fast, I look forward to a possible follow up for this dramatic come back, a reasonably fun and smashing science-fiction monster movie. Worth watching!"

","I really like Godzilla and under normal circumstances I would have purchased this movie before I watched it. After seeing the previews something told me to rent it first. I am so glad I did. My biggest complaint with this movie is the darkness and dust clouds. It seemed to me that, except for scenes with people talking, like on a boat, the whole thing was shot at night or in a big cloud of dust and debris. The makers of the movie must have the idea that shooting a movie in the dark makes it scarier or more intense or who knows what. As far as I am concerned shooting in the dark allows them to use cheap effects, with hokey monsters fights. You don't even need a story, just turn out all the lights except for a candle, dust some dust around and flash some cheap images of monsters rolling around playing patty cake. I was totally disappointed. Rent it first, before considering a purchase."

","I usually enjoy these science fiction offerings, not necessarily for the story line, but for the quality of the special effects. I realized twenty minutes into this film that I most likely would be disappointed, and I was. The story line makes sense but because of the plodding pace of the movie I was hard pit to pay attention. The night scenes were particularly aggravating because I had a hard time following the action. I watched in HD and just could not make out what was happening. It made me feel as though the director was trying to save money on effects. By the time the film was coming to an end I was frustrated and upset that I had actually spent money on this mess. The Godzilla creature was good and his size very believable . The other creatures just didn't make the cut in their portrayal. This film is so forgettable that I am having trouble remembering it as I write. And the human characters are so forgettable as to be laughable."
"homuncluz","2","1","5","11 October 2014"," What was all that about?
","We have the 1998 Emerich Movie for reference - but in the wake of all recent Ocean Trench Monster blockbusters one would have expected something of a higher caliber than what was on offer. The final half hour was so tedious that I actually nodded off. You say that 192 thousand people have so far given that movie an average rating of 6.7? I'm completely astounded, or was that the average age of the voter? We, the genuine, easy-to-please movie buffs do not really care who stars in these adventure movies as long as they have been well cast, scripted and acted, also provided the plot is gripping with plenty of dazzling special effects and suspense. I settled down in the evening to be entertained for two hours, but my first look at the Monsters was a jaw-dropping, unqualified disappointment. They resembled rather ""Gismo-y"" modern architects' knock-ups of new, low-rise office buildings that somehow - wait for it - had sprouted a pair of wings! They did not have a patch on the blood-curdling, Japanese inspired Godzilloids. One more thing: the creatures seemed to exist in a completely separate dimension to the Humans, with death and collateral damage the result of an intersection of two planes, with civilization the unintended victim. The Human/Monster interchange was a bit like trying to explain emotions by radio to person with severe autism trapped in a tunnel. Environmentalists, as you know will always have their ten-penny-worth, here with our human race being taken to task over insecure nuclear installations, and very reluctantly, it must be said their futile deployment of nukes against an invincible foe. If you wanna get conscience don't bother looking for it beneath a white skin, right? There were also the obligatory moments of intensely annoying, Fabian references worked into the plot, i.e. that humans will never win against Nature, with Human artifices, together with their religion irrelevant in the ""bigger political future"". Will we ever get tired of Lefty's philosophies in film-scripts? When the producers ask for the money to finance new movies they presumably do not go to Communist Cuba. All in all then, un-entertaining, unconvincing and without a drop of ""je ne sais quoi"" or charisma. I was really bowled over by ""Commissar"" Emerich's ""2012"", so perhaps that was a difficult act to follow. This one, must have run out of gas."

On the other hand (except for usual running between cars on a clogged street and screaming and a lot of crashed buildings, but no Al Quaeda this time), people involved in this ""project"" did a fairly good job, but nothing exceptional. This movie also attempts to send some ecological message, but fails. All in all, forget about it. If you are nuts for monsters, watch previous version. Or don't.

You really want to like this Godzilla movie. Anyone would that grew up on the classic ""kaiju"" films. Pacific Rim, for all its flaws, was actually fun to watch, and it had all the same elements of this film, just put together in a way that not only meshed as a whole, but also showed Guillermo del Toro's affection for the genre.Hollywood had all the tools to make this a really good film, great directors, amazing effects houses, and yet they chose not to. It just saddens me."
"sladethedirector","10","1","5","27 June 2014"," Lived up to Hype
","This film was awesome. I don't understand why some people troll on this. Godzilla isn't a hero. He saves humans from the MUTOs and kills hundreds at the same time. He doesn't give a crap about humans. He's an anti-hero like he usually is. Godzilla was awesome in the movie even if he doesn't have enough screen time, but he has the amount of screen time as jaws and the t-Rex from Jurassic Park. This movie is very dark, serious, and atmospheric as the trailers promised, but it wasn't as scary as the trailers looked. I didn't like Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character too much, he was bland and you didn't connect with him. I like it when you connect with the protagonist more than the supporting characters. I also didn't like it when they cut back to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character in the third act then cut to the monster fight. I don't know why people say the characters are boring, Ford Brody was the only boring character. Dr.Serizawa and Elizabeth Olsen's character are the best characters because you connect with them more. Bryan Cranston was awesome in the first 30 minutes even if he was killed off early. Overall, Godzilla is an awesome summer blockbuster. Even if there aren't enough monster fights, the third act made up for it. This movie goes back to the gritty roots of the original, making Godzilla a force of nature and restoring balance."

Intense and heartfelt acting by Bryan Cranston and Juliet Binoche. Elizabeth Olsen played her part very well as a wife and mother who stayed strong, working and caring for her son and keeping him safe. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins were very believable as the scientists and worked well together. Godzilla, well, he was wonderful! I loved the way he was slowly introduced, the way we got just enough glimpses of him that kept us wanting more. And when we got it, we got it good. The roar, appearance and action was great! The design, actions of the M.U.T.O's were great and scary. I hope to see more of them in future movies. Alexandre Desplat's score was breathtaking and fit every moment perfectly."

I couldn't get into the fighting between Godzilla and those bird like creatures. I know Godzilla has those little arms but to get beat down by some Flying bird?

"theblackscythe","4","1","5","29 May 2014"," A Highly Mixed and Overall Disappointing Reboot of the Classic Franchise
","This film was easily my most anticipated release of the year, as a huge fan of the classic Toho franchise. My anticipation was amplified by the release of the excellent Pacific Rim last year, showing that the Kaiju genre can survive with modern special effect techniques. Sadly I was disappointed and I found this reboot to be a jumbled mess that failed to satisfy. As the film is highly inconsistent, I will evaluate both the positives and negatives of this production.<br/><br/>The Good: -Bryan Cranston offers a fantastic performance, helped by the fact that he is given the only developed character with an arc. -The effects on the Kaiju are great, particularly Godzilla who himself looks fantastic. -Perfect Sound design with a top-notch soundtrack. Particular praise must be given to Godzilla's iconic roar which is lovingly recreated, yet slightly modernised. -Finally the cinematography, set design, lighting and overall mise-en- scene is strong here.<br/><br/>The Bad: -The majority of the cast is awful (The only notable omissions are Cranston and a child featured during a sequence on a public train). They either fail to emote or have nothing to do. Particularly awful is Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who's expression almost never changes and has no emotional range at all. A truly terrible lead. -Bryan Cranston's character dies within the first 15-20 minutes. He then leaves a hole that the film totally fails to fill. -There is barely any actual monster action in this. Every time a fight begins, the film haphazardly cuts to the human characters, usually one of the many children heavily featured in the film. Compared to Pacific Rim, which featured satisfying action from start to finish, there is only one, short fight scene in the entire film. -There are far to many child actors in this film and most are terrible and cannot emote. The worst offenders are a little girl featured in the Hawaii sequence, and the main characters young son. This little boy is easily the worst part of the film due his unbelievably wooden delivery. -The films pacing is awkward. Slow for the majority, and then hyper- accelerated towards the end. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the film is a mess that fails to deliver. It doesn't offer anything unique and proved to lack any satisfying Godzilla action. The staring human characters are vastly terrible and the film devolves into a crappy melodrama."

","Now admittedly my only taste of Godzilla was the 1998 version that co-starred Simba and plenty of fish.'98 Godzilla both terrified and enthralled me during my almost-twenty-years on this planet. So, it was nostalgia, not fangirlism, that led me to see this film.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the fact that there are these two alien type winged creatures, dubbed MUTO, one a he and one a she (you see where this is going), who feed off radiation and will destroy whatever's in their way to chow down on their carcinogenic dinner. Mr and Ms MUTO are being hunted down by none other than ... GODJIRA! A giant dinosauresque type creature whose purpose in the movie, according to the Asian professor, is to restore order by kicking the butts of the two MUTOs.<br/><br/>The movie in a whole, is pretty damn good. Just don't go in expecting a fantastic human story, because there is none. The acting is grand, you feel the emotion and you want the human characters that you embark on the journey with to turn out OK. There's three problems with the human co-stars; one is that they serve no purpose only to run and flee (and would you blame them?!), two, you know what's going to happen to them, and three, they have as much dimension as a playing card. Is the acting bad? Not nesicarily. But the characters themselves could've been so much better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>What about our scaly hero? He's AWESOME. He keeps with the original design, his roar is chilling, and he kicks some serious ass. Not only that, but he has character! There's this little moment after he kills the first MUTO where he puts his forearm on his leg and leans forward, as if to say ""thank God, one job done!"" Not only that, but Godzilla is kind of a hero by association; he doesn't set out to kill humans, only to destroy the MUTOs, which he does, and then he just leaves to go home. Anyone he crushed was simply due to his size and clumsiness. The only thing with Godzilla is that he could've been shown more. I like the suspense that was building up to whenever he appeared, and, despite what I'd heard about him supposinlgy being barely in the film, he appeared a good bit - but not nearly enough! It was a clever cinematic technique, leaving me wanting more, but Jesus, I paid to see GODZILLA, not that thing that looks like something out of a Meatloaf music album... Jesus, talk about a bat outta hell! Speaking of the MUTOs, I liked them too! Not as much as Reptar over there, but they were alright. I felt feelings when they nuzzled each other, and when Momma MUTO mourns over her BBQ'd babies - damn, I felt sorry for her! BUT, yes, there's a but - there was simply too much MUTO and not enough Godzilla! Whenever they turned up I was like, oh, well at least they're bad ass, but where's GODJIRA?! I want what I paid for, damn it! I guess I did get what I paid for: I paid for Godzilla to destroy things and cause mayhem. I was really happy that he was hailed the hero, and was pleased with the ending. Aaron Johnson and Bryan Cranston were compelling enough to be likable, and Godzilla was awesome. The only real let downs for me were the humans and their story, and not enough Godzilla.<br/><br/>I do have a feeling that it won't be the last we'll see of him, though .... ;)"

A movie should always be a story of a human .. unless you are into monsters.. ( your 12 year old kid might be but adults should not..) So about 3/4 in I had yawning about 4 times already.. Then comes the --not so exiting ending-- and now huge plot holes surfaced . Unfortunately these are at critical to the whole outcome of the movie, not going to write spoilers.<br/><br/>So 8 (for a perfect entertaining movie but nothing too novel) +1 for CGI +1 for slightly original story on the theme. -3 the story needs to involve humans more or intelligent beings or we need to know what the hell they are thinking..! -1 no real characters to follow that are entertaining. -2 for major plot holes<br/><br/>So cannot give it more than 4."

","If you are going to see this movie, you probably want to be aware of a few issues.<br/><br/>First: If you decided to watch the movie because of the great actors listed in the cast, you may want to know that their role is only symbolic. They go away as soon as the arrive.<br/><br/>Second: If you want to see how 3D technology can be used to unleash a whole new way of portraying large scale tragedies, you may want to know that Godzilla was actually shot in 2D. The 3D version was made up afterward, in a way that resembles those children books that unfold in layers when they are opened. Some scenes end up really weird, like helicopters looking like models hold by puppeteers.<br/><br/>Third: A lot has happened since the first Godzilla from 1954. Katrina, Chernobyl, Fukushima, global warming, the Indonesia tsunami, the attack to the World Trade Center towers, they all shed new light on how societies deal with tragedies. If you anticipate anything that changed in our perception of major issues to have any influence in Godzilla's script, do not hold your breath. It's just a mixture of recycled plots you have seen too may times to count, including the guy that happens to be in the center of everything despite all odds and the girl waiting for him while doing caring work."
"jherrenor","6","1","5","22 May 2014"," Not bad but could have been so much better.
","I so wanted to love this movie, but I can only 'like' it. I liked the way Godzilla looked; I'm relieved they included his Atomic Breath, I like the other monsters, including Walter White.<br/><br/>The problem wasn't Godzilla didn't have enough screen time, or that there was only one fight. The problem was Godzilla has no character. He shows up, he fights. His job done, he leaves. And that's it! I know the scientist tries to explain it with 'the balance' theory but I'd rather see that fact on screen than have it explained in a sentence. And why doesn't Godzilla destroy cities? Didn't they drop the bomb on him? He should be at least a bit angry. Instead he's like 'so you tried to kill me? Okay I guess I should save mankind to restore the balance then.' really? Sounds like a rant for a movie I supposedly liked so what saved it overall? The Flying M.U.T.O. From discovery to hatching, escaping then terrorising, even courting, this creature stole the show completely. This thing had motive and character that Godzilla should have had in his own film.<br/><br/>For a reboot, it should be making the audience get to know what Godzilla is about. This movie unfortunately didn't do that. Godzilla was just side-lined too many times. A sense of disappointment does hang about though I still enjoyed the movie, mostly not because of Godzilla. Another opportunity missed methinks. ﻿"
"BadAids","6","1","5","22 May 2014"," ""He picks up a bus and he throws it back down...""
","From the offset, Gareth Edward's Godzilla sets forth to distance itself from the perpetual laughing stock that was Roland Emmerich's previous attempt at bringing the Japanese icon to life on the big screen. This is successfully achieved as the film proposes a darker, grittier and more authentic feel than its predecessor. Godzilla is sleek ,beautifully crafted and it's obvious that the studio spared no expense in rendering a Hollywood monster that would leave audiences wanting more. Unfortunately this is to the detriment of the film itself as the title character is more often than not overshadowed by both it's Kaiju and human opposition. Edward's attempt at blending both monster porn and a compelling story of human courage ultimately misfires as he fails to strike the mean between both approaches. These two primary concepts are underdeveloped and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's bland clichéd performance highlights the lack of attention given to characters who show less life than there primordial counterparts. However Edwards does step up to the mainstream with confidence and his Spielbergian influences add some degree of quality to an altogether under-whelming experience. The slow tease introduction of the showpiece à-la Spielberg's Jaws is certainly a step in the right direction but the lack of a payoff ultimately negates the positive intentions. This along with the never thoroughly explored 'Man versus Nature' angle only aids in emphasizing how much more this film could and should have been. Although sandwiched between some heavy hitting summer blockbusters, such as X-men, Godzilla is sure to attract significant audience numbers but with the final product delivering less Jurassic Park and more Lost World, it is undecided as to whether or not this is the film that will resurrect a franchise already dead in the water."
"mmn11-746-589296","6","1","5","22 May 2014"," Almost enough to be great
","This incarnation of Godzilla has many amazing and original aspects to it. Unfortunately, there are enough silly aspects to undermine its greatness. The sound of the movie probably best exemplifies the unevenness of the movie. At times the sound truly enhances the feel of the film submerging you into its reality. While at other times it removes you from this submergence with the question ""why is this sound a part of this movie now?"". Many of the visuals of the film are astonishing. While others simply make you wonder what am I looking at and make you want to tilt your head to try and get a better view. Perhaps the worst aspect of the movie is the lack of smart choices made by its characters. Almost every character in the movie with speaking parts of more than a couple lines does something to make me think ""That is pretty stupid"". Despite these shortcomings, Godzilla is worth watching for most movie goers. There is enough originality and interesting choices to make most viewers feel they did not waste their time."
"Scarletto39","4","1","5","21 May 2014"," What movie did everyone else see?
","I do not know why so many people liked this movie. I think my four stars is a rather generous rating. <br/><br/>To preface my review, I went in with zero expectations. I love monster movies and grew up watching the various iterations of Godzilla. But I was not following this movie closely. I just knew that it released and decided to check it out. <br/><br/>Here's what I liked: Godzilla looked cool and the fights were pretty awesome. I actually didn't mind that Godzilla had limited screen time. He owned it when he was on. <br/><br/>The plot was okay. The acting was okay. No one is winning an Oscar for those two things. <br/><br/>What ruined this movie for me were all the little, but very dumb, decisions the film makers made. For example, when the monster passes beneath the railroad bridge, it doesn't even sway. (And let's be honest here. None of the monsters were being careful about where they stomped so the fact it didn't even touch the bridge is ridiculous.) When theses giant monsters emerged from the ocean, it barely even moved the ships. People are the size of ants to these creatures, and yet they seem to hear and notice a single guy. That is not the Honolulu airport, and they filmed in Oahu. <br/><br/>I can suspend disbelief for any movie, but I cannot leave my common sense at the door. This movie either needed to embrace the campy or at least TRY to be a good movie. Instead, this was neither."
"elliebartlett303","10","1","5","19 May 2014"," Fantastic, and great theater experience!!!!! Two thumbs up
","I remember when I first saw the trailer to this movie. When I saw Ken Watanabe, I knew something was up, then I heard the beautiful roar that belonged to the king. Godzilla. As you can see, my expectations were very high for this flick, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards directed one of my favorite Indie films, Monsters, which a lot of folks didn't like because it was more character-driven, than monster-driven. In my opinion, that's what made the movie, and it was beautiful. A lot of people didn't like Godzilla for the same reason: Lots of character, not much monster. I do see where they are coming from, being they wanted to see Godzilla, and got more Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen, but I like when the director gets into the character. <br/><br/>The acting was great in this. Bryan Cranston mostly. He is really moving up on my list of favorite actors. He is so intense and slips into his roles with passion and authentic. I do wish they would have killed him off later in the movie, instead of the first 30 minutes. But hey, the parts he was in were phenomenal. Elizabeth Olsen was surprisingly good. It's not that I expected her to be bad, I just thought she would be one of those girls that is just there for appearance and to cheer the leading men on. But, she shockingly showed emotion well and seemed very dedicated to the role. Ken Watanabe, a Japanese scientist who knows most about the creatures, was alright. He did what the role called for (which wasn't much.) Even though all he really did was talk science and look off in the distance, he says Godzilla better than anyone! I really don't know why they got a big star like Sally Hawkins to play a character that maybe has 5 lines. I mean, this woman was nominated for an Oscar this year, give her some lines! And finally, Aaron Taylor Johnson: Okay, I honestly do not think he ruined the movie....unlike other people. Like Ken Watanabe's character, the role did not call for much. Johnson did what he needed and looked great in a uniform. What else could you want? Sure, there was some boring dialogue in the movie, but is that his fault? No, its the writer's fault. <br/><br/>The monsters weren't in the movie much, but when they were, they were friggin awesome! When Godzilla breathed friggin fire.....I DIED!!!!!!!!! I do think that they should have showed Godzilla more than the Muto monsters, but they were a good addition to the film. But, I could have gone without the Muto monsters cuddling. They are monsters. They have no feeling.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was fantastic. Was it the Dark Knight of Godzilla movies? No. Could it have been as good as the Dark Knight? Probably not, The Dark Knight was groundbreaking and classic. There were only slim problems with this movie, and it really didn't let me down. And if you didn't like the characters, wouldn't you rather more character, than just monster and no character development whatsoever?"

","I went into this movie running through all of the other reviews gathered up. Some of it might be a repeat of what you've either seen or read, but this movie felt large. Never before have I felt such a presence overwhelm the screen. The sheer presence the king of monsters brought to the screen came in powerful and left the same way. You just don't mess with this big lizard.<br/><br/>He came in commanding. There have been movies that display enormity of a creature, but this captures these colossal titans. Even the ""Muto"" was able to leave its mark. There were actors notable of course...especially Brian Kransten (Sorry if misspelled).

","... I would have loved to have seen more of the monsters fighting than anything else. Besides that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was very well cast. Bryan Cranston (most famous for Breaking Bad) put on a very good performance. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass 1 & 2) did a pretty good job. Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins) is an incredible actor that never disappoints. Elizabeth Olsen (who went uncredited in Captain America: The Winter Soldier) literally takes over the screen as the main female character. You have for the most part a very good ensemble cast. <br/><br/>The CGI was pretty decent. It didn't completely saturate the entire flick, unless you are catching it in 3D. Nonetheless, it blended pretty well with the live action shots.<br/><br/>It is the action that I could have seen a lot more of than telling the story. A Godzilla fan would rather want to see the creature tearing apart towns and pouncing alien monsters. There was, to me, just not enough of it.<br/><br/>My rating is more of an 8 1/2 than an 8."

It was a great throw back to the Godzilla movies of old but at the same time, it had a fresh new feel. This is a good thing. It breaks the mold that was set countless times. Was it perfect? no of course not. It has its flaws. But what it does really good is REALLY good. I really enjoy Gareth Edwards' way of story telling. It might seem slow to most people, but what do you expect? This isn't a high octane adrenaline rush. It has a touch of reality even with it's giant stars. My favorite part about it is NO SHAKY CAM.

First, the movie did a extremely good job at telling the character stories. The way they told the story of Ford Brody trying to see his wife was excellent. (Possible """" spoiler) ""The big fight in the movie was spectacular to watch, they were crashing into building, swinging tail and arms at each other, Godzilla's laser beam was beautiful and blue."" The only issues I had with this movie, were Bryan Cranston was only in the first 15 minutes of the film, and you don't actually see Godzilla until about the hour mark.

","When the news first broke last year that Godzilla was being brought back to the big screen, let me just say I was hardly thrilled. After having seen the fantastic Pacific Rim, I didn't know how Godzilla would ever match up. Well, allow me to extend my most humble apologies to the filmmakers. This new film's director, Mr. Gareth Edwards, created a ""monster movie"" with heart. But, this is not merely a monster movie. This is a movie about ordinary everyday people having to deal with the consequences of toying with nature. The cast here is well put together from Bryan Cranston as a determined scientist to David Strathairn as a no-nonsense Navy admiral. What really makes this film shine is the script and director's sense of realism. The musical score works very well here, particularly in the film's creepier moments. My only complaint here would be the film's running time. I wouldn't have minded 10 more minutes! lol. Finally, the monsters. Just one word to describe them: AWESOME."
"roneeld","9","1","5","18 May 2014"," A classic monster movie for 2014
","One of the pitfalls of making a movie like this - attempted relaunch of a classic franchise with decades of built in familiarity and expectation - is that you end up trying to please everybody. The result can be a bloated, contrived spectacle with no heart, meaningless plot, or worse still, disappointed audiences and a broken brand. Cinema is littered with example upon example.<br/><br/>This isn't that. It's a different beast altogether. It's a spectacle, agreed, but in the most agreeable, exciting, and entertaining way possible. A film that knows what it is, what it wants, and how to get it. Much like the protagonist itself. There is enough heart through the human story delivered by very capable actors to draw audiences in and commit to the world it portrays. And by staying close to believable scenarios set in real locations, it keeps the viewer connected and interested throughout the incredible scenes that unfold.<br/><br/>And incredible they are, with benchmark-setting CGI and visual effects, sound that would shake stadiums, and design and rendering of the monstrous creatures and their environments is of the highest order. Coupled with an overall tone that maintains the ominousness of the plot whilst staying true to the origins of Godzilla, you've got a package that speaks on the passion and genuineness of the filmmakers who will no doubt be recognised for this achievement in due time.<br/><br/>Gasp, squeal, wonder, then clap.

"dearbornvendetta","7","1","5","18 May 2014"," Aaron Taylor Johnson with a small side of Godzilla
","There is a fantastic Godzilla movie here....Unfortunately its mostly left in the background and you only get glimpses of it. For the rest of the time you're focused on Ford played by Aaron Taylor Johnson aka Kickass. His character is a army bomb diffuser or disposer I cant recall which one for sure. He has been separated from his wife after going on a risky trip with his estranged father played by Bryan Cranston. Now he is trying to get home but he's stuck in between 3 giant monsters all duking it out. I failed to take much enjoyment from the humans in this movie and the star of the show was present so little I couldn't get much enjoyment from him either. I felt like the movie kept teasing me and teasing me, showing you brief glimpses of Godzilla and showing you a few seconds of a fight here and there. The method would've been fine if the final battle was epic enough to justify all the teasing. Unfortunately the true finale of the movie didn't reward my patience the way I would've hoped. The special effects here are amazing and Godzilla looks so awesome. And you need to watch this in IMAX to truly get submerged into the sheer scope of this movie. There are defiantly hints at a sequel and a possible reference to the next monster to show up but ultimately this movie left me feeling like I had a boring orgasm after 2 hours of foreplay. I came home and wanted to watch Cloverfield which in my opinion is a superior monster movie. In Cloverfield even with the lack of the monster I cared enough about the humans thanks to the filming style to still really enjoy it. Godzilla didn't give me enough monster and it gave me a so so human story. I cant help but feel a little underwhelmed but this is still a great movie and there is a lot of fun to be had."
"Lukebob-Spongepants","7","1","5","18 May 2014"," Probably worth a watch, just...
","It gets a 7 quite generously as I believe is incredibly hard to make any sort or storyline whatsoever in a cataclysmic monster battle film. Firstly, Bryan Cranston. Wonderful actor, very realistic and moving tones of voice. That being said he is almost completely under-used. He's killed off by a rather sudden and unjust death. He doesn't even have the justice of seeing Godzilla with his own eyes. Secondly, there is no character development at all. Johnstone is a good actor and I like him in his Kickass films. His story is built on losing his parents to these muto monsters and spends the film making sure his own family doesn't perish with them. Not sure if it's tension they're trying to create with the nuclear warhead or extra drama, but it didn't change anything for me. The actual monsters we're pretty cool, nicely designed, but perhaps a little too invincible, everything seemed bullet resistant. The Godzilla blue flame breath was just a little too unbelievable for me. He already has what seems like eternal life and huge size, now he's part dragon. Special effects, brilliant as expected. The films main character(s) only change one thing in the whole film which is Johnstone Killing the muto offspring and in turn saving Godzilla. May I say the fuel truck was very conveniently placed... Only Godzilla films will never get tens because tens belong to films which can hit multiple genres. They've done as much as they can and definitely the best Godzilla film out there."
"RuiD","6","1","5","18 May 2014"," Not bad, not amazing either...
","Thought I'd leave a short review of this for everyone.<br/><br/>Just watched the movie in 3D and have the following observations to share. The story is changed from the previous editions and is a fresh take on the tale. Please keep in mind that my reference for that is having watched the 1998 edition of Godzilla which had Godzilla attacking Manhattan.<br/><br/>The pros include great CGI, a fresh story-line and a whole lot of *new* I did leave the theater a little underwhelmed though. Despite the story being a new take, it tended to get confused with two separate story-lines - the human interest angle and the actual Godzilla portion. Both those portions, to me, seemed a little half baked and I wished for more.<br/><br/>I just left thinking that there wasn't enough of Godzilla in the tale, and as I don't want to spoil the plot, I do believe many of you will take away the same feeling after leaving the theater. I believe great special effects isn't always enough, and though the whole tale is a work of fiction, certain plot movements are beyond plausibility even considering that...<br/><br/>But is a fairly entertaining tale, meant for the big screen. Lots of popcorn and you may leave satiated, but not necessarily fulfilled.<br/><br/>Thats just my two cents though ;)"
"badajoz-1","7","1","5","18 May 2014"," Good attempt but tries too hard
","This is a valiant attempt by Gareth Edwards to make a significant westernised 'Godzilla' movie. Much of it is good, but it is let down by trying too hard to be significant (too much of American humans saving the world as usual) and lets itself down badly by delaying the entry in full scope of the King of the Monsters himself. The bad guys - Mutos - are too derivative, less interesting to look at and wonder about, and never given a proper description of their destructive powers, and given too much screen time compared to Godzilla. The story takes a long time to wind up - the much underused Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins just have to look frighteningly surprised as creatures begin to emerge into reality. Trashing Las Vegas comes not a moment too soon, and the sub plots with the young soldier and his father play out in far too familiar ways. There are tropes from too many other movies, including US army platoons fighting aliens/monsters almost alone. Worst move of the film, Gareth, almost as bad as the Halo jump copied from 'Starship Troopers 3!' But let's get onto the good. Spectacle, some excellent CGI (especially the wreck of Janjiro power station), a very good Godzilla who moves properly, a great deal of tension and build up, and a grandstand finish (perhaps too much destruction - also a fault of 'Man of Steel'). You get swept up in it, but the faults start as soon as you start thinking about it afterwards. But it does deliver a lot of the time."

","Barely jumped off my seat. I had anticipated a greater 3D Climax, however, the movie was good. The movie was cheated from opulent 3D effects, you know the ones that make you shriek and spill your favorite beverage. Those missing effects could have made this movie the best (necessary) 3D movie of the decade, thus far. Definitely not predictable (Ford's mom dies right at the beginning and then it's suddenly ""15 Years later, in San Francisco""). No ""post credit additions"", I was expecting it to end with one egg that ""survived"" the explosion, but gladly, that was not the case. I watched the first Godzilla when I was a kid (I barely remember what happened, but I remember I didn't get bored) and this ""remake"" did the original film justice. Definitely a movie to watch in 3D and on the big screen. If you do not watch this movie in 3D and at the cinemas (the big screen), you will spend a lifetime wondering what it would have been like to see the terror in enhanced visuals.

","The charm of all the human characters put together doesn't match up to the sheer scale of Godzilla. There is a wafer-thin story here that barely holds together, but let's be honest, no one goes to a Godzilla movie expecting to watch a great story unfold; one just wants to see as much of this huge creature as possible. Having said that, Gareth Edwards tries to maintain a balance between the monster scenes and those that are devoid of monsters.<br/><br/>Starring in Godzilla are Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Elizabeth Olsen, Juliette Binoche, Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn, and Bryan Cranston. This highly reputed international cast doesn't have much to offer as their roles are pretty one-dimensional. The spectacle belongs to the monsters. Godzilla chases huge insect-like creatures called MUTOs. The finale of the movie takes place in San Francisco, where we see the two MUTOs battle it out with Godzilla. Humans have no other choice but to be mere spectators to this showdown.<br/><br/>And what a showdown it is! Godzilla spews radioactive flares and tramples anything that comes in its way. Its massive body nearly sweeps down San Francisco. Some of the scenes leave you awestruck. There isn't much of Godzilla in the first half of the movie with only a few glimpses of this Japanese sea monster. However, the introduction of Godzilla in the movie is quite spectacular. There is a mighty roar that he lets out that reverberates throughout the auditorium.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that depict sweeping destruction in this movie. The story takes a backseat at many points during the movie and it is Godzilla fighting it out with the MUTOs that one witnesses. This is a far better deal than having a story that leaves the monsters out in the cold.<br/><br/>If monster movies are your cup of tea then you will not be disappointed by Godzilla. Some may feel that the movie lacks a proper story and the characters seem one-dimensional. However, in a movie of this nature, that is expected to some extent. In the end, it is Godzilla who is the real star of the movie and it truly is his movie."

","Okay, let's start out immediately on an objective view about Godzille 2014. Let's say this is the first time I saw Godzilla, I would assume the other series was about humans talking and making exposition, and frankly, not very good exposition either. I would assume that the other movies in the series made in Japan would be nothing but cities destroyed and just hints about what happened.<br/><br/>Here's what really a Godzilla movie is, I will write a plot that would be an authentic Godzilla movie now. It is not a hard thing to do, it's meant to be a b-movie. If for some reason it WOULD take place in the USA, then make the birthplace be inside the volcano at Yellowstone or the nuclear test site in New Mexico. The plot would be that the monster Godzilla, born out of the residue of radiation, awoke to teach humankind a lesson for misusing our resources. There would be preparations of Gojira coming by measuring the seismic activity around the coastline, then when Godzilla showed up, people would scream and fight, but they would seem unable to fight back, the monster would return to the deep and then the next time he or she came up, they would try to kill it, somehow succeeding, it would end on a bittersweet note that unless humans change, then Godzilla comes back. Wow, that is actually a Godzilla movie I would like to see, and I just made it up instead of this bullsh*t. Of course, when going to see a movie named ""Godzilla"" you expect the monster to have more than 11 minutes screen time, but this movie even manages to screw that up. I would give it half a star if I could, that's how bad it is. To end the review with a tip to the producers: America, do not make these movies, have Toho make them, OR make them under Toho's supervision, but for crying out loud, not another bullsh*t title of Godzilla. fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you."

She and the son add absolutely nothing to this movie. Her husband is in a country where there is an earthquake, she can't be bothered. This movie is a Big waste of time. The monsters are boring, they look like plastic bugs. They are not scary or menacing at all. You don't care about anyone in this movie. A Godzilla movie with no Godzilla, not interesting just plain stupid."

","First off, this movie is by no means greater than Zilla himself. It's not a bad movie either, if you just watch it with your brains turned off and take it for what it is: A Michael Bay style blockbuster. The effects are pretty impressive, and it's obvious this is in the heavy-weight class when it comes to it. Godzilla couldn't, in my opinion, be better realized than here. You really feel like he's a real monster, and not just a CGI mess like in the 1998 version. I haven't yet seen the movie, just because i haven't had the time nor the interest since i've heard a lot of bad stuff about it, and honestly i can't imagine Matthew Broderick in an action flick, let alone a disaster/monster movie. Anyways, i've seen the monster and i've seen what the original looked like, and this one stayed true to the original, and is from what i've heard, the biggest Godzilla in the movieverse yet, to ever come to the big screen. The plot is a little stiff i'll admit and it's obvious you aren't meant to think a lot about it. After the characters and storyline have been established it's quick to kill off my favorite actor Bryan Cranston, which i thought was a bit disappointing because i thought he was supposed to be our deuteragonist alongside Aaron Taylor Johnson. Aside from that, when we finally see what we thought was Godzilla being unleashed in that abandoned Japanese nuclear power plant, we instead get what looks like the monster from Cloverfield? These are referred to as M.U.T.O's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object). Yes correctly, these because moments later another one appears on the screen only this one is a huge motherf*cker, the female. Apparently they're supposed to mate (the other one being a male and has wings, which the female don't) and they go on a rampage together through San Francisco. And finally we see the king himself, as he attempts to bring order to nature by going Battle Royale with these bastards. In the meantime Ford the protagonist (Aaron T.) tries to get an atom missile of some sort close to the beasts so they can anihilate them, and bla bla. The fight is impressive by all means, though i feel like it should've been longer and more detailed. It felt like it lacked some serious soul, like it was the ginger kid of battles. When he used his Zilla blast, i couldn't help but think ""why the f*** didn't he use it to begin with?"" I hate that they made it like some sort of video game, where he has to power up before he can use his special move, as if it was a Dragon Ball game of some sort, jeez? I love that they made him like this sort of misunderstood monster, the protector of mankind that men just were too afraid to realize, so they ""killed"" the poor bastard. Almost like King Kong. But unlike the king of the apes, Zilla saved the day and redeemed himself and man finally left the poor king alone. My favorite attack was when he grabbed the female by her jaw appearing to wanting to rip it open like Kong did with the T-Rex's in the 2005 remake, but instead he breathed fire into the bitches mouth, totally overkill, totally cool!!! But as i said, it's an okay popcorn flick when you have nothing else to do, or have movie night with friends or whatever. Just don't watch it, expecting to see a whole lot of Bryan Cranstons amazing acting abilities."

","Firstly, let me say i am EASILY pleased when it comes to a good movie... <br/><br/>If a bad story is saved by cool action im happy, if a good story saves poor action then fine... i even found the first Godzilla remake entertaining...<br/><br/>So first what does it do good... Godzilla CGI and building destruction - i liked it. I was almost impressed. The monster noises - cool homage to the originals...<br/><br/>What does it do bad<br/><br/>Well... the story line is VERY VERY poor. The acting pretty much sucks, leaving you with no emotional connection with any character in the movie... Brian Cranston isn't really a headline actor in the movie and even he struggles to carry the movie. <br/><br/>The effects of the other monsters (not Godzilla) are AWFUL... <br/><br/>There are too many loopholes and unanswered questions...<br/><br/>The best way to describe this is like a ""between the lines"" movie... so imagine Godzilla came out, then they brought out a special edition feature which was a movie made that shoots all the in between bits you weren't bothered about... that pretty much sums it up.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I felt emotionally dead to the Godzilla franchise... I just hope that the new JP fills the void that this never did."

The only reason I gave this title 3 instead of 1 star is that music is great. To sum it all up, before the movie started I said that I didn't quite like the 1998 Godzilla and that it is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen..well I stand corrected, the 2014 version is actually going to be on my ""I don't recommend it, but if you want to waste 2 hours of your life then what the hell"" list."

","I liked this one better than the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick, simply because it reverts to making Godzilla the ""good guy"" monster again and shows him battling the ""bad guy"" monsters in the vein of the classic Godzilla films. You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange ""goings-on"" in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.<br/><br/>I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done. It could have used some character development, though. I still liked it a lot. You will love it! *** out of ****"

","I went into the cinema with high expectations for this film, i was severely disappointed.<br/><br/>The writers attempts to insert a human story into a film about huge monsters was cringe-worthy, and as soon as Godzilla is introduced staggeringly late into the overlong film, the human story is forgotten completely and gives way to simple meaningless violence, which although visually quite impressive, lacks the power to make me interested in it at all, there was simply not a single 'wow' moment in the whole film. Trying not to spoil anything, the whole first hour of the film could have been cut out without too much impact to the overall experience.<br/><br/>Whats more, the film is riddled by immense plot holes and laughable scenes where the humans are simply too stupid to notice the 70 story tall monsters walking right past them. I have to say the monsters in this film were incredible stealthy for their size, managing to sneak past pretty much the whole US military. It is almost worth a watch just as an example on how not to make a film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is riddled with plot holes, has bad action scenes, is boring and the introduction of Bryan Cranston is just a simple gimmick.

","It was a horrible experience having to go through with watching the movie. I absolutely loathed it. I went into the cinema with high expectations and came out with a frown. There was no character development, no real plot, except for the U.S government (more so the navy/army) attempting to stop a malevolent creature. Godzilla is portrayed as a hero in this movie, and I have to say, I greatly disliked that. I actually hated the fact that they added more creatures. I deemed it to be completely unnecessary and a pathetic attempt to change things up from the original plot. I couldn't wait until the movie would be over. It had no theme either, which is amongst the most important elements of a movie. The acting was below average, and Bryan Cranston's role in the movie was over-exaggerated in the trailers. I thought he would have been the star, but instead, Aaron Taylor - Johnson appeared as the star. It's extremely predictable, and is nothing better than a bad action movie made only for the shock in the viewer. They didn't even do a good job with that."

In fact, all the main characters act to a pretty good standard - no complaints at all.<br/><br/>The look of the movie is great.

He is a huge, intimidating presence.<br/><br/>The action sequences are good, you care enough about the characters and story is as good as it gets for monster movies. Why only a 5?

","I am going to start of with saying, I grew up a GIGANTIC fan of Godzilla. The original 1954 film is one of my most favorite movies ever. And I feel this movie pays a nice homage to that. I don't really understand why there are so many people who feel this movie was boring and that they felt the acting was terrible. I was hooked right from the beginning of this film, right when I heard that classic score(composed excellently by Alexandre Desplat). Although Godzilla isn't in your face for a good portion of the movie, I didn't mind it. For one, he wasn't really in the original movie all that much, so I didn't mind that at all. Two, less is more, I'd rather leave the movie wanting more, than I would leave with a headache(a la Transformers 4). The only thing I really would change about this movie is that fact that Bryon Cranston's character dies fairly early in the movie, which was disappointing because we had just gotten attached to him, why not kill him off in the end? It would have been that much more emotional. Also, just because Godzilla is not on screen a whole lot, doesn't mean we don't get any monster action when he isn't there. For example, I found the scene on the train tracks with the MUTO to be very suspenseful, and somewhat reminded me of Jurassic Park. Overall I feel people are a little too hard on this movie, I am looking forward to a sequel, and am definitely buying the score to this movie as well."

"cristikivu","6","1","7","17 May 2014"," Another chapter in the trend of dark, gloomy and shallow reboots and movies
","Before jumping in ""Godzilla 2014"", I would like to go through what I believe the ""curent trend of dark, gloomy and shallow reboots"" is. It's a post 9/11 age, a time in which Americans seem to have lost their confidence and their optimistic perspective on life. 9/11 proved Americans could no longer be in control of their fate or even the World's.<br/><br/>During the 1990s era (which includes mid 1980s and early 2000s in my opinion) some of the best movies of all time were released (Back to the Future, Terminator, Home Alone, Shawshank Redemption, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Gladiator, Titanic and many more). The 1990s style of movie-making is full of concepts revolving around: feel-good, happy end, good is good and bad is bad, clichés (today regarded as such), family fun, quite appropriate for all audiences, natural humor, Americans always saved the day and were always right, expressive acting which the audience relates to - establishing that golden connection between the characters of the movie and the viewers.<br/><br/>The post 9/11 movie-making era trend is dark, gloomy and shallow. Reboots like the Dark Knight series, Man of Steel and other movies like Noah best fit this current tendency. It's a trend which tries to lower the tone and atmosphere of the movie to a dark and gloomy reality. The Americans destroyed New York so many times in movies, but when this actually happened, it shattered their overly-optimistic view on life, sobering them up and opening their eyes to a world and a reality which does not have a happy ending, and it is not still there when they exit the theater. Shallow - due to the poor and many times distant style of acting today. The relationship between the viewer and the characters is ignored, being replaced with a self-centered, wooden and evocative theatrical performance. The emotions of the actors are unnatural, forced and many times altogether missing.<br/><br/>Comparing Godzilla 1998 with Godzilla 2014 we see just that. Before the release of this reboot, people generally considered the 1990s remake a bad movie or at least dated or poorly executed. I did not regard it as such, nor did I believe it was a great movie. After having seen Godzilla 2014 today, I can honestly say that I would rather see the 1990s version again rather than this ""updated one"". Firstly, Godzilla 2014 strengthens my previously mentioned idea that Man or more precisely America is just another part of the world and not it's leader or Saviour. Americans did nothing or better said were not able to do nothing to stop the MUTOs or Godzilla. What the Japanese doctor said was very relevant: just ""Let them fight"" (reffering to the MUTOs and Godzilla). The Americans did not save the day, Godzilla did. All the Americans did was to arm a nuclear bomb which the MUTOs feasted from and after which the same Americans failed to disarm. The Americans just watched and attended a battle of monsters. Their contribution was the destruction of the MUTO nest - and this only done last-minute, by one guy.<br/><br/>Second, the performances of the actors is just horrible, with one huge exception: Bryan Cranston. This actor is brilliant in any role he takes, from the iconic performances in Malcom in the Middle and recently in Breaking Bad (he can do more than comedy), Bryan takes up all the focus. Sadly, he was cut off halfway through the movie, killed inexplicably. Why start a movie with a professional lead performance and in the middle decide to switch the main character with a plank of wood? At the end of the movie, it actually seemed like I watched two films: one in which Bryan Cranston was the lead and the other where there was no main character.<br/><br/>Next, going in a reverse logic, the title of the movie is wrong. It should be called MUTO or The rise and fall of MUTO. Much like in the recent King Kong or even worse, Godzilla is a supporting character and at times an extra. Most of the monsters scenes were focused on the MUTOs. I went to the theater dying to see Godzilla (keeping in mind that we barely saw it in the trailer) and instead I only got an extended trailer. From an evolutionary point of view, Godzilla from 1998 is much closer to a dinosaur or reptile or at least has a somewhat logical anatomy whereas Godzilla 2014 (trying to evoke the 1950s and traditional Godzilla) struggles and, in my opinion, fails to convince you that such an anatomy makes any sense whatsoever. It does, if you want to dress up a guy in a dinosaur costume. Only then does it hold up, but wait a minute, isn't Godzilla 2014 a CGI monster? <br/><br/>The score was good, but unfortunately unoriginal and evocative. It reminded me of the 1950s style of scores for disaster movies. <br/><br/>I understand I am watching a reboot but why can't it be altogether new? Just take the concept and rewrite it. Why evoke some much of the past? Why not bring a new design for Godzilla, why not create an unique and memorable theme song (again, like many 1990s movies which have fantastic soundtracks, easily recognizable). This direction is similar to the one in the recent Star Trek movies. So much evocation. Why? Why bring the old 1960s theme song back in a remixed version, why bring a lead actor which physically evokes the older iconic one, but lacks charm or personality? Why not just create something new from scratch?<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really wish the movie industry would try to come up with an original contribution to old concepts and generally try to work harder and create something new to leave behind as a distinctive mark. Regarding Godzilla 2014, I wanted to see more of the fire-breathing dinosaur and Bryan Cranston. Winner: Godzilla 1998 or future reboots."

","The name Godzilla brings to mind the epic, and whilst the new Godzilla is epic, the movie certainly is not. The movie is alright don't get me wrong, but the monsters were the only thing that kept me in the cinema. The plot and vapid one dimensional characters had me bored out of my mind. Bryan Canston delivered a good performance in the first part of the film that I felt Taylor-Johnson was unable to match, this led to a decline in my interest in his characters story. In my opinion Ford's wife and child were unnecessary and clichéd they had little to no use and only served to waste screen time, whilst Wantanabe's character Dr Serizawa was grievously underutilized. Godzilla however was brilliant to watch on a scope like nothing we've seen before and truly an awesome sight. I loved every second he was on the screen. I feel this movie has been let down by poor writing, sacrificing a good plot and distracting us with a lot of bone rattling sound and god like destruction. I feel as though I was treated a bit like an idiot with little of my questions answered and instead glossed over with quick answers/excuses that made little to no sense. The film is worth watching at the cinema though as what little makes it good will be lost when it is transferred to the small screen."

","Its a meh. I actually fell asleep in the 2nd act. I actually went to  see this because 'Heisenberg' from 'Breaking Bad' is in it but they  kill him off early. Bad move there because he is the best actor in the  film. Very much a let down because I enjoyed Bryan Cranston's  performance immensely.  As far as the Godzilla design is concerned, my kids say he looks 'fat'  as compared to the original Japanese versions and the classic Godzilla  roar is noticeably off. What is curious is how in the trailers they  conveniently use the original/traditional roar and then they pull the  carpet out from under you in the actual film. Note to Hollywood  producers: Don't fix something that isn't broken! One has to expect  they will change the look of the Keiju to make it fitting in these CGI  times. However, the roar of Godzilla is not negotiable. It would be  like if they changed the sound of the light saber. It just wouldn't be  the same. That is how I felt with this. In fact, the first time  Godzilla roars, I felt confused. Like perhaps my hearing was off. I was  reminded of similar feelings when I saw Godzilla 1998. Not good.   It is what it is. Hope to have better luck next week with X-Men: Days  of Future Past!"
"sohansurag","7","1","8","17 May 2014"," A Remarkable Reboot from Gareth Edwards
","Godzilla, a legend that rhymes with the celebrated monsters of all time, the likes of King Kong and Frankenstein. Of all the summer blockbusters, Gareth Edward's Godzilla would undoubtedly be among the top. The previews were haunting and thrilling enough to build hype. The anticipation it'd built is understandable, considering Roland Emmerich's very mediocre Godzilla. Almost 15 years after, this years iteration had loads of promises to keep and going in for the movie I had my hopes way too high like any other Godzilla fan. And without further ado, I'd like to say I was satiated.<br/><br/>I was welcome to a customized IMAX intro which served as a great node to the monster in question and then to a scene where Ken Watanabe's character, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate a mysterious incident, the shots constantly reminded me of a movie from the past decade, from the aerial views of a copter to Ichiro's hat. Had John William's score been playing in the background I would have mistaken it for Jurassic Park. Shortly after, we are introduced to Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody working in an Atomic plant in Tokyo and there on it served a heavy dose of the grim things that was about to come. While the characters are well written, it takes a long long time to get to the juicy bits. But believe me, your first glimpse of Godzilla will be well worth the slow burn and the tension thus built and works very much in favor of the over all tone of the movie. The humongous beast himself is a sight to behold when he makes his appearance, hulking over buildings like a true god. The monster's design stays true to its roots, albeit with all intricate details, as opposed to its redesign in Emmerich's Godzilla which seemed like a giant Iguana. I'll leave the details for you to experience it for yourself.<br/><br/>Gareth Edwards was a brilliant choice as the director and Godzilla shares a similar style with his previous movie, Monsters. He has done what Christopher Nolan did with Batman. Rooting the characters in a believable world that we could all relate to. He was able to achieve the tension and dread as well as the impending fate of humanity and then leading to an amazing, jaw-dropping monster scuffle finale.<br/><br/>A charismatic Bryan Cranston plays Joe Brody, a grief torn husband who won't stop at anything to find the mysterious atomic plant calamity that killed his wife. I was surprised as there was no applause seeing Cranston on screen, after all he was our favorite Walter White. His performance was awe inspiring and demanded nothing less than a standing ovation. Later on we are introduced to Aaron Johnson, Brody's son, and initially felt fine for the role though later on it seemed like he was in no hurry and felt a bit bland for the role. The world, his wife and kid's lives are at stake and this guy is acting all super cool. Elizabeth Olsen played Aaron's wife and while she had a good presence her absence wouldn't have made much difference either. Ken Watanabe displayed a good performance, but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>Let's get onto the bad bits now. There were these sequences where the monsters would be on a full on collision course and guess what? It'd be shown on a teeny TV screen in snippets .What?! I mean saving the best for the finale always seems like a good idea, but only on paper. It might work well for an indie/TV movie like Monsters but for a movie with a gargantuan budget like this, it was a tad bit disappointing. I understand Gareth was focusing on all the drama but being a fanboy I would have loved to see more Godzilla and MUTO going head to head. It takes over a whopping 60 minutes to have a glimpse of Godzilla and till then we had to sit through the human drama. It was so severely trying not to be Pacific Rim by injecting more drama and less monster brawl. This is where Pacific Rim won, it was all about the Robots vs Giant Monsters, yes it was pure style over substance but yes it was also what I had asked and paid for. Alexandre Desplat's score was well synced with the visuals capturing tension and haste in equal proportions, but at times, felt a bit subtle as well.<br/><br/>1998′s Godzilla was in no means an intolerable movie, it had loads of monster action topped with another ton of cheese and my own 5th grade self had loved it at the time. But being a grown up I found way too many flaws to love it as much as I had back then. Gareth's Godzilla is much more dark in tone and leaves no room for cheese or humor and instead its a huge step up from its predecessor. Huge credits should go for the visual effects team making the monsters believably enthralling. This is almost a perfect reboot for the franchise which has some much needed heart and drama."

","Godzilla (2014, 2:03, PG-13, Imax, 3-D) — SF, biggie, remake<br/><br/>It's everything you expect in a Godzilla movie and nothing you don't. Special effects are bigger and better than ever before. I saw it in Imax (worth it for the big screen and big sound, not so much for the retrofitted 3-D, which is nothing special).<br/><br/>If you were expecting meaty roles for top-notch actors Bryan Cranston, Julette Binoche, and Ken Watanabe, too bad. The first 2 are killed off early, and Watanabe mainly just stands around with his mouth open (tho he and sidekick nuclear engineer Victoria Graham do get a couple of minutes to unload the only exposition the screenwriters figured the audience would sit still for). At no point does anyone question why creatures that feed on electromagnetic energy need such huge mouths and so many teeth.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen is utterly wasted in a throw-away fretting-mom role, and the nominal hero of the whole shebang, Aaron Taylor-Johnson (much buffed up since regularly getting his ass kicked in the title role in Kick-Ass) stoicizes as a Marine lieutenant thru a series of disasters that he just happens to be in time to witness as he follows nature-balancing Gojira and its 2 new nemeses, a male and female mating pair of MUTOs, across the Pacific where they will jointly devastate San Francisco for a change, after warming up with Honolulu and Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Blessedly, the movie-makers let us see the creatures fairly early (instead of teasing us with obscure distance shots and partial glimpses for much of the movie) and at full size. Unlike the Transformer movies and Pacific Rim, you can actually see who's doing what to whom else at reasonable distances, and at speeds resembling real time. Good shot composition and no soft-pedaling of the destruction involved, tho the PG-13 rating is preserved by showing us essentially none of what had to be a gargantuanly massive toll of deaths and injuries.<br/><br/>Godzilla gets bigger with every incarnation, and this one is no exception, making it perfectly believable that some forces of nature (like Antarctic glaciers, sunspots, and giant radioactive Japanese lizards) are so powerful that humanity is helpless before them. Really, with CGI technology as advanced as it's gotten, there's no upper limit on creature size, certainly not the frequently and cheerfully ignored square-cube rule. I expect that soon we'll be seeing Galactus gracing the big screen.<br/><br/>Of more substantial interest, the opening trailers included one for Christopher Nolan's latest mind-blower, Interstellar, due out Nov. 7. It's not the case that the trailer alone is worth the price of admission, but it's value added."
"Vondaz","6","1","8","16 May 2014"," Darker than previous 1998 version - but in more ways than one
","The plus point is that this film had more dramatic development than the previous 1998 version. <br/><br/>But then again other re-re-booted movies have also adopted this approach - Man Of Steel, Amazing Spiderman, Incredible Hulk. The problem they all have is that it is just a pre-amble to the inevitable over the top action sequences. <br/><br/>And in the case of Godzilla, action sequences that are done in darkness so you can barely see what is happening. It might have been the 3D glasses making it darker than it would be in 2D, but the detail just wasn't there. Godzilla and the MUTOs were apparently going hammer and tongs at each other, but I couldn't sense the extent to which they were injuring each other (until the final atomic breath climax). <br/><br/>We've all grown up with the original impact of the jaw dropping moment we saw dinosaurs come to life in Jurassic Park. This movie added nothing more in terms of impact of the last 21 years of development since Jurassic Park (Godzilla even sounded like T-Rex). <br/><br/>The human peril element is handled in 2 ways (i) intimate focus (on the train or in the rubble) where those who do perish are mere unknowns, so long as our heroes survive or (ii) detached focus (buildings being knocked down as the monsters fight) where you assume all occupants are dead (or conveniently trapped safely under the previously mentioned rubble). And as for our heroes - there was no acting. No development of character. They just provided the human forefront to the monsters back drop.<br/><br/>What I also found confusing was that Godzilla was hailed a hero for destroying the MUTOs and applauded as he walked back indiscriminately through the rubble and dead bodies that he had helped create. <br/><br/>The end was the usual cliché - family reunion that you could predict a mile off. Did the director really think ""people will want to know that the family are re-united, so I'll draw it out"". Oh come on, I found my empty popcorn box more appealing at that point. <br/><br/>Can this please please please be the last of these movies? Please please do not feel the need to develop a sequel."
"Ryan_Lev","7","1","8","16 May 2014"," Where's Godzilla?
","Since America's original attempt to make a movie adaption of Godzilla, we have all been eager for Hollywood to try again, only actually make it good. I'm not saying this movie is terrible, but I am saying it needed some work. Here's something I loved about the movie: The opening montage. The montage was perfect. It got us into the feel of the movie and made us understand what to expect. After that, we have exposition in 1999 that shows our protagonist (Not Godzilla) lose his parents in a nuclear eruption. Then, we get to the present day where we get exposition on the same material, only in the background instead of the foreground. Eliminate the 1999 exposition might have actually made the story somewhat better and better for the producer because watching from present day on, the story still makes sense, and the producer doesn't have to spent all this cash on extra locations and actors. My biggest concern is the lack of Godzilla in a movie title ""Godzilla."" 25 minutes into the film, we are introduced to Muto, a giant bat that can stop sound with its sonar. My initial thought at this time was ""Where's Godzilla?"" We don't see Godzilla until 20 more minutes later only for a brief 2 minutes. Then, we don't see him again until he fights Muto for the climax with 30 minutes left of screen-time. Though the epic battle between Godzilla and Muto was cool, it was not enough satisfaction. Most of the movie focus on Brody, a soldier, conveniently always not being attacked by Muto, when everyone next to him is being attacked by Muto. The movie focuses too much on side- characters we don't care about and not enough on Godzilla. It focuses on Muto so much that the movie might as well be called ""Muto vs. Godzilla."" So, should you see it? I may be slamming this movie, but Godzilla is an icon as big as Mickey Mouse. Just because this adaption did not have enough to offer to me, does not mean it will not satisfy you."
"ClaytonDavis","6","1","8","15 May 2014"," Godzilla FINALLY Enters the 21st Century With Style
","When there's smoke, there's fire and the screen is ablaze in Gareth Edward's reboot Godzilla. From a technical and aesthetic level, the film is unmatched by anything seen in 2014 thus far. Exhibiting such creative styles of directing, Edwards hones in on all of Godzilla's personality traits that have made him such an icon to the cinematic universe. Everything from his choices of screen shots, brilliantly set up by Oscar-nominated Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, and his approval of Alexandre Desplat's haunting score, Edwards successfully brings Godzilla in to the new century with admiration and respect. This is one of the most entertaining summer blockbusters of its kind since Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>There's nothing that can benefit any person seeking to see the film if I reveal any plot points. I did an admirable job of steering clear of any plot spoilers that could have ruined the experience. I implore all movie goers to exercise the same discipline for any future franchises or films they are anxiously awaiting. What I will speak about is the at times, uneven script by Max Borenstein and Dave Callaham. Borenstein's most notable credit is Swordswallowers and Thin Men (2003) and Callaham has had a hand in The Expendables franchise and Doom. The first third of the film is succinctly riveting, and full of rich and layered characters that lay an incredible foundation for the story. After a key character is disposed of forty minutes in, the story takes clichéd approaches to action heroes that both feel unnatural and unrealistic. Understanding that this is science fiction, I need a strong level of believability for a film to succeed. There are several instances that eye-rolling occurred and annoyance set in.<br/><br/>From an acting stand point, there are many great things that are being displayed. Bryan Cranston is a true highlight, full of ferocity and emotion that settles the viewer as much as he creates nervous tension. I'll fully admit to gushing over the reality that now, Academy Award nominated actress Sally Hawkins, is now in a summer blockbuster franchise and slowly becoming a mainstream entity. As the lead, Aaron Taylor-Johnson executes when appropriate and challenges his own abilities as we've come to miss in films like Savages and Kick-Ass. In this franchise, Taylor-Johnson illuminates as a more confident, detailed version of ""Jake Sully"" (Sam Worthington) from Avatar. Another true highlight is Elizabeth Olsen, who continues to be one of my favorite actresses working without THE role yet. Though she's minimized to cheap crying and terrified screams, Olsen stands out.<br/><br/>The rest of the all-star cast: David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe, Juliette Binoche, and Victor Rasuk are all solid performers in otherwise, underwritten and/or misfired roles.<br/><br/>Production Designer Owen Paterson builds an apocalyptic world to an outstanding degree, especially in one that takes place in present day. He's excelled in things like this before with past efforts in The Matrix and V for Vendetta. The Visual Effects team is simply astonishing. Godzilla looks superb. Every detail, nuance, and mannerism is marvelously captured. It's the strongest visual medium that the year has offered. If there's one thing that you can take to the Oscar bank, it's the Visual Effects team. I am also completely enamored by the Sound Mixing and Sound Editing that was audibly enticing to the ears.<br/><br/>Godzilla is pure fun and pure entertainment, no matter how you slice it. If you're looking for something to offer up some great laughs, visuals, and thrills, you have it all right here. There's more depth to the film, something that many will find and latch onto however, it's not a complete home run like one would have hoped. It's still vastly superior to the garbage that was the 1998 film. This Godzilla is just fine. By the way, if you can, IMAX 3D is just what the doctor ordered on this film. Do yourself a favor, and fill the prescription."

","The movie isn't bad but it isn't Godzilla. I am willing to bet the director and writer never saw single episode of original Godzilla. Previous attempt at Godzilla was miserable and this was a bit better but still failed to capture the beast. Godzilla isn't just some giant destructive monster. The movie have failed to capture the original character which Hollywood often likes to do. They should have just named it something else and would've been a good movie. Acting was above average and special effect was excellent. But it is sad that the movies now days put more emphasis on effects than story. And there was nothing revolutionary regarding effects however. Overall, just a good movie."

"quincytheodore","6","1","9","15 May 2014"," Regardless of the flaws, Godzilla serves as a colossus carnage leaving destruction on its wake but not on the original material.
","Returning to his original fire hazard gigantic form, Godzilla delivers roaring monster mayhem despite some uneven pace and thin script. In a polar opposite of the lighthearted rendition 16 years ago, Godzilla is now radioactively gloomy, bringing a more nuclear oriented plot. It opens well with good human interaction for first half, but sadly the momentum dies down in lieu of gargantuan fight, which is somewhat acceptable and expected just by looking at the title.<br/><br/>The cast looks a bit stumbled with the sparse dialogue and repetitive scenes. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ford Brody does look the part of a marine with ancient history with unnatural disaster. He carries himself decently until the last act where he stares into the ruins or eyes of behemoth far too often. Ken Watanabe is utterly underutilized, channeling Mark Wahlberg from The Happening. He seems so confused the entire time, even at ordinary moments, and at rare scenes where he's given script, his role is reduced to giving catchphrases.<br/><br/>Bryan Cranston as Ford's father does a fine performance setting the somber tone at first half. His part is by far the most emotional one; it's a good set-up for the reveal and sells the menace of the creature. The movie works by building the anticipation and not prematurely showcasing the giant, although in some scenes the story progress is told by exposition, either by news or reports. It makes the encounters feel rather cut short, it could've used more visual delight before switching gear to next sequence.<br/><br/>Graphic has more somber atmosphere, at later parts the movie even embraces horror vibe, completely with eerie humming. The drab color palette adds more terror, there's little quizzical tone to be had here. While it's not as colorful as the recent monster movie Pacific Rim, the theme holds consistently. Effects are put to good use; unworldly battles are done with powerful impact. Camera angles often tease the massive beast, occasionally focusing on its scale or eye to enhance the size. Contrasting color, with each passing setting, delivers the solemn ambiance.<br/><br/>There is discrepancy while the story moves forward, human interaction is increasingly reduced towards the end. The movie could've maintained the relationship, but it is certainly lacking at last act. No amount of child actors put in dire situations, and one dog, can bait more sympathy from audience. Script itself is lacking, often leaving the characters glaring emotionless to the screen. A bit coincidence or plot luck is also at played to fit Ford Brody to the scenes, which understandable in disaster movie. Regardless of the flaws, Godzilla serves as a colossus carnage leaving destruction on its wake but not on the original material."
"cameraslie","6","1","9","15 May 2014"," Good character movie, tense, but would have liked more threat!
","The 2014 Godzilla movie presents a story about an attempt at covering up a monster causing chaos with lies about a natural disaster. Scientist Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is not convinced, and determined to discover the truth. <br/><br/>The characters are very well developed, the viewer certainly sides with them and their motivations. The plot is very different from previous Godzilla films, and recommended for an alternative Godzilla story.<br/><br/>The creature is given an unexpected additional weapon in its arsenal that is used to great effect and well explained. <br/><br/>However, what the film had in character and plot, it lacked in violence and threat. The effort they went to with CGI for the creature while swimming, or being generally observed, clearly didn't extend to CGI fight scenes. The fight scenes were slow and unexciting. The overall damage caused was below the expected scale, and unintentional. To say that recent Spiderman movies were more violent than this Godzilla movie would be entirely accurate. <br/><br/>Tension was well created, but the resulting scene was often underwhelming.<br/><br/>Watch for a different take on Godzilla, with new monster abilities!<br/><br/>Michael Newton<br/><br/>Cameras Lie"

","I'm going to be very honest with my review on Godzilla (2014). Is it better then the 1998 film with the same name...........YES, hands down it better then that film. Is it a good film sadly for me no. I won't lie there were some bits i did enjoy but not a lot f it. If you enjoy watching The America military prove how dumb they are by trying to blow things up with out thinking, even after someone said it's a bad idea............This movie is for you. If you enjoy watching every America movie Cliché.......... This Film is for you. If you enjoy giant monsters causing mass amounts of damage........... The last 20-30 minutes are for you. I don't mind slow build up but you have to have a strong cast and characters to keep you interested. Apart from Bryan Cranston the cast was well boring. I have never been to a movie where i was sighing and groaning even rolled my eyes waiting for something to happen. When stuff did happen to begin with it was in small dose teasing the monster which was enjoyable. Sadly thought you see most of the movie through Aaron Taylor-Johnson eyes so you miss most of the monster action and focus of the what the Military is doing. The Visual are stunning and Godzilla was beautiful. The other creature on the other hand thew visual impress was very generic looking, even willing to say it was from Pacific Rim. I really wanted to enjoy this film but sadly i felt a little angry after leaving the cinema. There are some good moment in this film and i know some people that will enjoy it. Sadly thought it not for me. I'd rather watch the Original Godzilla. Also there know bonus scene after the credit so don't stay till the end.<br/><br/>My Honest score 6.5/10."
"alex_howells92","6","1","10","16 May 2014"," Enjoyable, but expected more.
","When i first saw the trailer for this last year i was stupidly excited, I was expecting to see some really cool fight scenes with Godzilla against another monster or laying waste to some famous landmarks, the trailer had me believe it was going to be a lot darker themed than it actually was. Don't get me wrong its not bad film, its just not the Godzilla film i hoped for or expected. <br/><br/>There was a few things i didn't really like about Godzilla, main thing was that Godzilla only had like 5 or 6 minutes on screen and half of that was just his spikes on his back sticking out of the sea. Seemed rather pointless even calling the film 'Godzilla'.<br/><br/>I personally wasn't a fan of the way the Muto looked. they just didn't look menacing enough to what i was expecting. In my opinion Godzilla looked like a better bad guy than they did.<br/><br/>No actual Monsters actually seen in the film for the first half of the film also it felt like their was little to none explanation to when Godzilla appears half way through the film. <br/><br/>It seemed like Godzilla and the Muto where invisible to any soldiers looking for them like when they are in Nevada Dessert and the one Muto has gone missing. Its literally in eye viewing distance making its way to Las Vegas to mess the place up! <br/><br/>Every time Godzilla was getting into a fight with the Muto's the scene would change to Aaron Taylor Johnson doing more army stuff. I didn't mind the army stuff, it just seemed like a wasted opportunity to see a cool fight scene with Godzilla.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen really didn't do much in this film, she didn't bring anything to the film all she really did was just look upset or frightened through the whole film and not really doing anything. <br/><br/>The ending was pure cheese! The way Godzilla stands up and the news station labels him 'The Savior of our City' and he just swims off and the film suddenly ends. such a disappointing ending, i would of liked to seen a cliff-hanger or so subtle reference to some other monster for another film but nope, just a cheesy ending making me feel kinda cheated.<br/><br/>The film did have its good parts though,that Godzilla Roar! even though i didn't enjoy the film as much as expecting i still loved that roar!<br/><br/>I know a lot of people are saying Aaron Taylor Johnson was a bad lead role in this film but i personally enjoyed him. I haven't seen him in much i only really know him from 'Kick Ass' but i felt he fit the role quite well. I also thought Bryan Cranston was a interesting character in this film, he certainly breaks away from his Walter White character and near the beginning of the film the scene with his wife in the nuclear power plant is pretty intense. <br/><br/>The special effects were pretty good, I did love the way Godzilla actually looked.During the final fight he shoots this laser ray thing from his mouth and that's pretty epic! and when he does it again at the end when he forces open the Muto's mouth and shoots it down his throat was a cool way to end the fight.<br/><br/>Overall, yeah its an alright film but if your hoping for a cool looking monster fighting film like i was i would recommend watching 'Pacific Rim' over 'Godzilla' instead."

","Godzilla final wars was supposed be to be the grand finale to the legendary king of the monsters . But there was talks about a 40 minute godzilla movie directed by the guy who directed godzilla vs hedorah but nothing very came out of that . But then legendary studio picked up at and then it was announced that we were going to be another American Godzilla movie . Fans where excited to see godzilla coming back and a little nervous because of the last America made a godzilla movie . On may 15 the movie came out well is very split among fans . So people praising it because Bryan Cranston and other people hated it because godzilla was it to much so what do i think about it . Well I really liked the movie it definitely has problems but its was a welcome return to franchise that had been dormant for way to long . Bryan Cranston is amazing in the films and it sucks that he's not in the movie all that much. Brody was fine just your typical hero character .his wife was fine she just worried a lot and that was really it. Dr ishrio serizawa is the second best character in the movie . All the other characters are pretty forgettable .some of the shots in this movie are freaking fantastic they shoot. The monster from low angle which make them fell bigger and powerful . Very similar do what they did in the original film . The music is meh i do wished they used the classic Godzilla theme but they did in Godzilla king of the monsters . The MUTOS are ok they are very similar to the cloverfield monster and they weren't all. That original but it was nice to get some new monsters instead of using the old. Is pretty unfortunate that the MUTOS are the main focus of the film and not godzilla but yet again this isn't the first godzilla movie to do this . Now onto the king of the monster himself GODZILLA he was amazing and easily the best part of the film . This godzilla felt huge and powerful and yes why is was disappointing that it wasn't a guy in suit still was pretty damn awesome . Now people had complained that Godzilla wasn't in the film all that much and that didn't bother me . Invasion of Astro monsters is one of the best godzilla movie and he's in that movie for 5 minutes . The one thing i really hated was the cutting away from godzilla. Whenever godzilla was going to do something awesome they cut away. Despite it's flaws i think this is a good movie and welcome return for the best movie monster of all time hail to the king baby."

Last year's Pacific Rim was a fun entertaining experience, and this is no different. Something very rare happened at my screening. Everyone was cheering. The only other time that's happened was at the ""Doctor Who"" 50th anniversary movie. The beginning is slow, but by the end of the film, so much awesome stuff has happened that it's forgivable. This film is not cheesy like the originals. It's incredibly well done and I wouldn't be surprised if we got a Pacific Rim/Godzilla crossover. (Make it happen Warner Brothers!) This is a very exciting, fun movie. There are a couple of jump scares however, so if that's not your thing, rent it. For the rest of you however, I highly recommend seeing it in the theater. Just like Pacific Rim, it's a BIG movie, that you have to see on a giant screen. The acting in the movie is somewhat flat, but if you're in it for the monster mayhem, it's easy to forget about the average acting. There are a few unneccessary conversations that drag the plot out, but by the time Godzilla appears, all is forgiven. It's a big monster showdown movie that's incredibly awesome. In summary, Godzilla is a fun time at the movies.

"5MinuteMovieGuy","4","0","2","17 September 2019"," A blunderous reboot that's barely better than the '98 Godzilla.
","This year marks the 60th anniversary of the original Godzilla film, when the King of the Monsters first emerged from the Pacific and terrorized Tokyo, Japan. Roughly 10 years after America dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II, Godzilla was artistically created to be a physical, living representation of the destructive force of those bombs. Even the texture of his skin is modelled after keloid scars, which were found on survivors as a result of the radiation. Godzilla's arrival and subsequent attacks were spurred by the use of nuclear weapons, and he as a character wholly embodies the consequences of nuclear warfare.<br/><br/>60 years later, Godzilla remains a global icon, having spawned dozens of movie sequels, while introducing several other enormous monsters to battle with. Then 16 years ago, he was reimagined as he first came to America in Roland Emmerich's lackluster 1998 film Godzilla, leaving many fans severely disappointed with not only the film, but also the new rendition of the famous monster. While Godzilla is visually depicted much more accurately in Gareth Edward's new 2014 Godzilla than he was in '98, his entire presence is surprisingly different than usual. This isn't the angry, vengeful Godzilla of the past. He actually now seems almost entirely indifferent to humans. Unfortunately, as promising as this new Godzilla movie may appear to be, it falls far short of expectations, and dare I say, it isn't even much better than the 1998 Godzilla.<br/><br/>Godzilla (2014) starts off pretty well, strengthened by the performance of Bryan Cranston, who plays Joe Brody, a nuclear power plant engineer living in Japan. Brody is present when an unknown disaster occurs at the plant, costing many innocent lives. Despite what the trailers suggest, Cranston's Brody is not the main character of the film. Nor is it fellow all-star actor Ken Watanabe. The main character is actually only seen for about 4 seconds of the film's original 2 and a half minute trailer. It's Joe Brody's son, Ford, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, in a performance that is decent but far from engaging. The protagonist Ford Brody is a character that is largely uninteresting, and who just casually wants to get back to his family after the monster invasion. He fails to convey any genuine sense of urgency amidst the chaos, although the same can be said for the entire cast, with the exception of Cranston's Brody. Cranston's performance is the only one that has any emotional weight to it, but he can't carry the film alone. Meanwhile, Ken Watanabe is essentially reduced to being the quiet, ever-present voice of reason that no one wants to listen to. The film has a solid cast of actors, but they're not given enough to work with in this convoluted mess of a movie.<br/><br/>For a movie that has so much death and destruction, the people in the film never seem all that concerned. You get no sense of global panic and hysteria. You have a 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities, with millions of people dying, and yet nobody seems all that freaked out by it. It's almost like the situation isn't treated as a serious threat, and there's a major lack of suspense altogether. There's rarely any edge-of-your-seat terror or excitement, and the lack of emotion just makes the action come off as sort of flat and dull. Not only that, the majority of the destruction that's taking place isn't even seen, with the movie instead opting to show you the aftermath. Throughout the first two-thirds of the movie, the camera continuously cuts away from the action you've been waiting for. Rather than showing you what you want to see in full-glory, the movie frequently will take you to a different location where you'll briefly see a few seconds of the catastrophe being watched by someone on television. It feels like a cheap trick to build up to some amazing climax, but it's incredibly frustrating. It's like when watching a reality TV show and then the show cuts to a commercial break before revealing the winner. Perhaps it would be more forgivable if the end was enjoyable, but even though it does give you a full display of the showdown, it's bogged down by a tiresome human story and still lacks any real emotional punch. Despite the fact that the movie tries to convey a serious tone, it's also incredibly cheesy. To the extent that the big finale that this movie has been trying so hard to build up to ends up being almost laughable. Ultimately the movie ends up just being unsatisfying, disappointing, and overly long.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ways in which Godzilla goes wrong, despite the film's great potential. One of my issues is with the musical score, which ends up coming off like a bad punchline. Music is supposed to accentuate the action and drama of a film, yet the film feels emotionless and boring. The only time the music really stood out to me was when it was being used to heighten the suspense of the climactic battle, and essentially narrate who was winning. It was done so ineffectively that it was both kind of comical and embarrassing. I also have an issue with all of the special effects, which are being touted as absolutely amazing. They're not. However, I will say that the use of special effects in the movie is quite ambitious, but it works to the film's detriment. There's simply too much of them, and this excessive nature of the film is, I think, its biggest mistake. Godzilla (2014) is ridiculously CGI-heavy, and while their scope is admirable, I really think the quality would have been substantially improved if they didn't overdo it so much. I think a less-is-more approach would have benefitted the film in many ways. It's excessive to the point of making good things turn bad. Everything is way too over the top, causing the action to lose its impact. It's evident the filmmakers were trying so hard to make this big-budget movie as epic as possible, but this enormous scale ends up backfiring. The rampage covers two continents, multiple cities, and even traverses the length of the Pacific Ocean. I can appreciate their attempt, but the movie is trying to do too much. In other words, Godzilla (2014) bites off more than it can chew.<br/><br/>I also have some problems with the film's treatment of the titular character, Godzilla. First of all, for a movie named after him, he sure doesn't appear much in it. He's the reason why we want to see the movie, but he's absent for the majority of the film. Even when he's around, he's largely obscured by CGI smoke and storm clouds, up until the final moments of the movie. I'm also not particularly fond of his appearance. He just doesn't quite look like Godzilla to me. It's like looking at a T-Rex head on Godzilla's body. I'm aware that Godzilla's facial appearance has changed many times over 60 years, but something just doesn't look quite right here. Additionally, I feel that Godzilla's face is actually too expressive in this new film. I wonder if this was done to cause viewers to feel more sympathetic to him, because in the film, Godzilla is actually depicted as something of a tragic hero, rather than a colossal beast. This is my biggest concern with the movie's handling of his character. Godzilla's destruction in the film is treated like it's all unintentional, and just a result of his massive size. Even though humans attack him, he's not angry about it or anything. Never mind the movie's claim that all of America's nuclear bomb tests after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were actually secretive but unsuccessful attempts to kill Godzilla. He doesn't mind. He's just a poor gentle giant that's misunderstood. Really, Hollywood? Give me a break!<br/><br/>To say that Godzilla (2014) is almost as bad of a film as Godzilla (1998) is a statement that I don't take lightly. It's a bold and controversial thing to say, and it may seem a bit absurd considering that this film goes in the right direction, whereas the previous film was all wrong from the beginning. Yet while the new movie has all the right pieces for greatness, it extends its reach too far and attempts to do too much, while never managing to make any of it very good. In all seriousness, I was more entertained with the '98 film than I was with this one. I can hardly comprehend how a movie with a giant 300-foot-tall monster destroying cities can be so boring. Godzilla (2014) focuses so much on trying to build up to an epic conclusion that it forgets to worry about making the audience care, or even about keeping them entertained, and it just gets worse as it goes on. It repeatedly tries to raise the stakes, as well as our expectations, while attempting to delay gratification until the end. It's a risky move, and unsurprisingly, it certainly doesn't pay off. On the bright side, Godzilla (2014) is probably a pretty sweet movie if you're a 12-year-old. There's plenty of action, some cool special effects, and he's still a pretty awesome monster. However, for me, I was totally pumped up for this movie, but an hour and a half into it, I had endured enough and wanted to walk out. Godzilla (2014) disappointed me on so many levels. It's a movie without a beating heart. It's predictable, overly long, has uninspired characters and a weak story, and the action just never hits the right note. A little more emotion and a little less CGI could have a gone a long way in making this movie better. As a fan of Godzilla, I felt frustrated, detached, and perplexed with how they were able to do so much wrong when they had the groundwork for something great. You know, perhaps I'm wrong in claiming it's comparably bad as Godzilla (1998). After all, the last time I saw that movie was in the theaters when I was 12."

The movie is so jampacked with awesome moments that you're find it hard to decide which is your favorite moment though my favorite part was the sky dive from the HALO. The designs of the monsters were amazing and their concept was brilliant. However, the movie does have flaws the human characters from the movie isn't satisfying or engaging enough for you to connect with them to feel for them and they're and it's plot narrative is based more on the MUTOs the archenemy of Godzilla than Godzilla himself which makes you feel like Godzilla as a secondary character rather than the titular character plus in a movie named after Godzilla he hadn't had much screen time."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a 2014 monster movie that is directed by Gareth Edwards. The movie's screenplay is by Max Borenstein, and the story is written by David Callaham. The movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen. A nuclear power plant suffers a catastrophic failure leading to several deaths in the power plant staff. A father and his son investigate and discover evidence of titanic monsters.<br/><br/>Godzilla is a movie that one watches for the spectacle. The spectacle here is impressive to watch with every scene having an epic feeling. The movie is shot incredibly well. The only disadvantage to the movie is it may appear too dark. This was not a problem for me as the movie wanted to have an apocalyptic feeling. The CGI and effects still hold up even in the overly dark cinematography of the movie. Godzilla and the MUTOs are impressive to watch and they cause many grand scenes to appear. Even the introduction of the military in observing the creatures is incredibly well done.<br/><br/>What separates this Godzilla movie from the 1998 Godzilla movie that was directed by Roland Emmerich is that this one focuses more on the human characters. The human characters have more important roles in this movie as they serve as gateways to the monsters and the audience's connection to them. Surprisingly they even help Godzilla deal with the threat of the MUTOs. It was important for the human characters to exist and they offer good characterization. Bryan Cranston delivers a great performance in this movie along with Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. The characters do not have deep characterization but they have enough to make the movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>The sound in this movie is awe-inspiring. Every military vehicle has a great distinct sound. The monsters are also impressive to hear. This movie is best enjoyed with a grand sound system as the movie wants to immerse the audience in a great auditory experience.<br/><br/>I would recommend Godzilla.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","British Director Gareth Edwards (veteran of the SUPERB 2010 film ""Monsters"") steps in for this umpteenth Godzilla reboot, which offers an interesting mix of grand-scale (pretty realistic-looking and flag-waving) military involvement and at times rather surreal or impressionist-looking monster scenes. Given that Godzilla is (in line with tradition) a guy in a monster suit (that's TJ Storm), that seems wise.<br/><br/>Godzilla's enemy is the radiation-loving MUTO creature (in fact two of them, with babies set to hatch at any moment), and here we presumably resort to other techniques to screen these flying-swimming-walking and on-fire creatures never fully identifiable at any point in the two hours, but looking a tad like a more robotised version of the arachnids in ""Starship Troopers"".<br/><br/>Anyway, Godzilla is a hero figure (breathing blue fire), who - true to the original concept - (eventually) rids the world of those pesky bugs. Crediting him with ""saving San Francsico"" seems to be going a bit far, since he destroyed almost as much Frisco infrastructure as his enemies during the course of their fight!<br/><br/>While the detonation of a nuclear bomb just a few miles offshore is ridiculously under-emphasised in terms of its effects, the story is mostly followed logically otherwise (to the extent that the main concept can ever be logical), and deftness of directoral touch is to be witnessed at many moments in the film.
Perhaps unfairly - but also in the interests of authenticity - every reference is made here to real-life destructive events like Chernobyl, the tsunami in Japan, Fukushima, and 9/11; and this stokes up the impact considerably. This also means eccentric moments and weird juxtapositions of the intact and non-intact that such scenarios really do denote.<br/><br/>Perhaps rightly, actors are not too important to this story, though the most familiar faces are Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche (sacrificing husband and wife in the context of the movie's leeeeeeeengthy scene-setting phase), as well as Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins; and all do what they have to do well enough. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is rather there but not there...<br/><br/>But mostly this is a disaster+monster movie handled well, taking its time to a surprising (and mostly telling) degree, with a lot happening out in the dark and in the depths or in the distance, and assuming the necessary creepiness that that entails.<br/><br/>Scary it aint, but atmospheric certainly yes..."

","Even if you've never seen any of the films, you know the name. With it comes memories of nuclear destruction, giant monsters, and that godawful 1998 travesty of a movie. This is the first Godzilla film (American or otherwise) in ten years. And now, with a colossal hype train behind it, the king of the monsters is finally back. Was it worth the wait? Alright, maybe it's not REALLY worth a decade, but the new Godzilla is a damn god film nonetheless. The only major flaw is its slow start. And when I say slow, I mean very, very slow. Sure, a nuclear power plant collapses and the presence of the to-be-revealed creatures is hinted at, but just be prepared for some long stretches of dialogue before anything really picks up. But once it does, it becomes abundantly clear that Godzilla is arguably the best monster movie of the new millennium. The visual effects are spectacular, and the sound design is sufficient to shake the seats in the theater. It's an experience like nothing else."

","Don't know what happened the first time i watched this. i hated it. possibly preconceived notion of an action packed transformers-style movie. this is more of a suspense thriller with action. i think it would have helped if i had the mindset that i've evolved to, being open to all possibilities when i start a movie instead of expecting something and being disappointed. i kept my original review at the end for reference lol.<br/><br/>this movie was pretty awesome. i thought about going all the way from 1.5 to 3.5 but i hesitated, maybe on third viewing. it was suspenseful, the music was awesome, and the monster scenes were epic. i still think godzilla himself was a little slow and clunky and there were a few tease moments where i wish they would have just stayed on the fight instead of cutting away, but this was a very enjoyable experience the second time around. (2 viewings)<br/><br/>original review 1.5: just didn't like it. wasn't my style. most of the movie was a tease, not being able to see what's happening or having an obstructed view. got bored during it. didn't feel for the monster like they wanted me to. and I know they were trying to be like the original but Godzilla just looks fat, ugly, and stupid. liked how he looked more zalama in the 1998 version better"

","Although I can't watch all of Godzilla series, I watched even a previous movie for preparing for new one at least. Maybe I watched some of them in my childhood but I've forgotten. So I enjoyed the setting and the concept purely.<br/><br/>Hollywood version Godzilla had a thick neck! I guessed its design made sense more in physically than the original one like animations. I felt like I would be traumatized on the aliens similar to large insects. But it was kind for me because it didn't burst like MIB. It was doubt whether it had much of a presence though.
I know a famous episode of ""Shin Godzilla"" that Godzilla's skin was based on bitter melons. How about Hollywood version's? Don't tell me that it was based on the same!<br/><br/>In some scenes, I couldn't see in detail because of the darkness, but the story was simple and clear. I felt a good thing was the story without a twist."

","The audio!!! It's worth it just for this experience alone, especially when the MUTO is near the railway bridge. They did an incredible job of making the monsters sound massive and loud. But when Godzilla finally appears (definitely an intentional tease for half the film and worth it) the realism is astounding.<br/><br/>The story, well it's alright I guess. There's clearly a hint towards our obscene misuse of nuclear power and the waste it produces. But it's still better than a lot of monster movies. I'm not how the protagonist survives though. That's probably the most unlikely part of it all.<br/><br/>This is, in my opinion, the Pinacle of all gigantic monster movies and absolutely the best Godzilla movie so far. Hopefully the new one doesn't stray from this format and gives us the same suspense. I haven't seen King of Monsters yet so I'll wait to review that.<br/><br/>But this. Oh my!

"minabasejderha","7","0","2","4 June 2019"," Been on a Kaiju kick lately (1 of 3)
","[7/10] - ""Met expectations""<br/><br/>I admittedly don't have as much to say about this one as I do it's two sequels.
This is mostly because I've heard most of my thoughts voiced better by other people. For example, I agree with Bob Chipman that the movie would have been better if it had focused on Ken Watanabe's character rather than the rather generic main family. While Godzilla is strangely absent from the movie, this wouldn't have been an issue had the main cast been more interesting.<br/><br/>I will say, the movie is an example of really solid filmcraft. The cinematography, while dark, is also (usually) adequately clear. Godzilla almost always looks fantastic on screen (I actually think he looks better here than in the sequel).<br/><br/>And there is one sequence I want to shower with praise, when the bomb-team is skydiving into the Kaiju battle. I've always felt that a Kaiju series would be best if its creatures were portrayed as Cosmic Horror, much like the Great Old Ones in Lovecraft. While this would have created an excessively delicate racial subtext in the Kong film, with Godzilla, I think it is appropriate. The skydiving scene, more than any other, captures the Lovecraftian angle. Not only is Ligeti's ""Requiem"" a suitable callback to the Cosmic Horror in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, but the cinematography has an amazing way of creating scale. The broad skyline shots, where they skydivers are mere specs and trails of red smoke, are interspersed with POV shots by the skydivers. Their POV is limited by their goggles, and we only see the monsters fighting in brief flashes of light. When we drift close to Godzilla, we get the first proper sense of his might and our own insignificance in his presence. The goggles too serve as an excellent visual metaphor for the ways in which our human perspective limit what we can see and understand. By constraining the sight of the audience, they communicate the constraints of our comprehension.<br/><br/>It was just a magnificent sequence. I can't say enough in its favor.<br/><br/>{MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE FORWARD}
One of my general criticisms is only in the light of seeing its two sequels, in that it seems like the Godzilla movie's are a little trigger happy with the nukes. ...Like... I get it. Godzilla is almost always about nuclear weapons on some level or another, but their overuse makes them feel a bit anti-climactic. Not to mention, I feel like their destructive power is ultimately underwhelming considering how few people they actually kill. The sequel's use of such WMDs would have been more satisfying if the nuke in this film had been successfully deactivated and if everyone had sighed with relief. Then the actual use of them in the sequel would have more weight."
"windshieldwipers","6","0","1","2 June 2019"," The MUTO Movie, featuring Godzilla
","I saw this movie opening night in 2014 and boy did I love it. Until I let it sit in and the more and more I think about it, it's kinda boring and underwhelming in some aspects.<br/><br/>The positives:
Gareth Edwards's direction is absolutely amazing. He shoots Godzilla low and from human perspective which gives Godzilla a grand scale. The last 10 minutes are also really good and some of the best in Godzilla history.<br/><br/>The negatives:
The human characters are really boring, besides Bryan Cranston. Everyone else just seems either bored or uninterested. It's like they were only there for their paycheck and could care less how they acted. And it's weird because the cast is full of really talented actors and actresses. While I praise Edwards for his direction, unfortunately, he doesn't know how to direct actors. The movie is also very dark but not like dark-toned but dark like where are the colors? You can't see the monsters fight at the end and you can barely see what the humans are doing at night.<br/><br/>Edwards is very ambitious for teasing Godzilla. He doesn't come onto screen until nearly an hour in. I like the teasing but what kills it, is that the human characters are boring and when Godzilla is not on the screen, they are and it can be tough to sit through. This isn't a traditional Godzilla movie. This one tries to be more grounded and focus more on the humans, which I'm all on board for, but the characters are just terrible. But at least you know their motives and stuff.<br/><br/>The movie also focuses more on the MUTOs than Godzilla. When you really look at it, it's more of the MUTO's movie than Godzilla's. It's not how much screen time Godzilla has is the problem, it's how it is used. They pretty much use all of it at the end and like I said, when Godzilla is not on the screen the boring human characters are. I don't have a problem with the movie being more character-based than action-packed but as I said, what kills the movie are the characters and since they have about 80% screen time, it can be rough.<br/><br/>To sum things up: Ambitious but at times boring. Not the worst Godzilla movie."

","So did I enjoy this movie? Well I kind of did. It wasn't the worst but could have been so much better. The main issue unbelievably was the lack of Godzilla. Without giving spoilers away some other monsters pitch up and this tempts Godzilla to rise out of the ocean and do battle, almost like a turf war of sorts. He doesn't like them hanging around his hood. So whilst the others cause carnage we see glimpses of the big dog. A bit of a tail, a spikey back. It's only the final quarter of the movie he does his thing. I quite liked it when he did, I wanted more. The CGI was fine and I liked the way he looked although at times my wife did say he was a big chubby and really cute. The movie had a really good Japanese Manga feel to it, sticking to its roots, which I liked. I also liked the nuclear back story. What I didn't like were the humans involved. The young guy playing the lead was annoying and there were just so many plot holes where he was involved. Way to many coincidences happening just to make the lame human sub plot work. I also didn't like the way Gods was treated like a hero when in fact he added to the carnage and death that followed. I will watch the next one but my take on it is less humans please and more Godzilla, that's what I say."

","Godzilla (2014) is a great movie all around. I don't understand why this movie gets the hate it does, other than the obvious misleading advertising. But a 1/10? This movie has a great score, great cinematography, and great visual effects. Regardless of what you think of the actual movie, you have to give credit to the sound and visual departments. So why not a 10/10? Well, my only complaint with the movie is that they kill off Bryan Cranston. While I do think that Aaron Taylor-Johnson gets a lot more crap than he deserves for his performance, Bryan was just a much more interesting character and to kill him so early was very disappointing. The teasing isn't a problem with me, since when we do see the monsters they make it worth while and show us very cool shots. It does get a little aggravating by the end, but I understand why they did it. They nailed the Godzilla roar, and the 2 new creatures had very cool roars as well. I also like all of their designs, putting the 1998 Godzilla to shame with how cool and samurai like this new Godzilla is. You can really tell by the visuals that he is old, and is just doing what he needs to to get back to the ocean. This movie was a great forgiveness message to the disaster of 1998."
"mattkratz","9","0","1","5 May 2019"," outstanding
","I liked this one better than the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick, simply because it reverts to making Godzilla the ""good guy"" monster again and shows him battling the ""bad guy"" monsters in the vein of the classic Godzilla films. You might prefer the originals because the cheesy special effects were what made them fun (or because of nostalgia), but this was a good entry in the series. It starts off with a scientist having to shut the door to cut off a nuclear cloud at the expense of his family while investigating some strange ""goings-on"" in the Philipines. 15 years later, his son is in the Navy with a family of his own, and is called to Japan because his father has been arrested, and monsters are being investigated. Of course one of them is Godzilla. Nuclear explosions are to blame, they reach San Fransisco, and epic battles ensue as our hero's family is in danger.<br/><br/>I think the monsters' battle scenes are a main highlight, and the vast majority of this film was well done. It could have used some character development, though. I still liked it a lot. You will love it!<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","In the past pretty much all the films have had about Godzilla have had him as our enemy so it was nice to have a change for once. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who was cast as the lead role did a decent job and wasn't made to be a Prince Charming character and his wife played by Elizabeth Olsen wasn't made to be some princess waiting to be swept off of her feet as she was seen to be pretty much the same as everyone else of the support cast in terms of emotion. Ken Watanabe who was cast as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa again did a decent job of playing his role in the film but his assistant was incredibly over emotional at times in the film at times which it was not needed.<br/><br/>When the action happened the cities it happened in the cities were pretty much destroyed (as you would expect) so you would see how powerful the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Object) and Godzilla were, not to the point where you were on the edge of your seat not wanting to distracted but to be fair the CGI in the film of them fighting was pretty decent in total.<br/><br/>Overall a solid Godzilla film with a nice change of direction of how Godzilla was made not to be the enemy but as an ally."

","I have to preface this review by fessing up that I've never really been a Godzilla fan, though I don't mind occasionally watching out of curiosity some of the 50's Japanese incarnations of the big guy.<br/><br/>What I really don't get about this movie though is that it had a $160 million budget and yet we don't really get to see much of the big set action pieces, because they're all set at night and happen in near darkness. Have a look at the Godzilla poster. That'll give you an idea of what to expect. If your idea of fun is peering into a dark screen and imagining you can make out what is happening with the monster mash occurring, then you'll probably love it. I couldn't help myself from glancing at my watch.<br/><br/>BTW there are some human characters. It's almost fraud to say the movie features Juliette Binoche. She is criminally underused and only has a brief few scenes and in most of those she wears a radiation protection suit. Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the perfunctory happily married couple with a cute kid, who are separated by the unfolding narrative and spend much of the remainder of the movie trying to reunite, in between dodging crashing skyscrapers. In truth they had far better back stories and stronger chemistry playing the sibling super heroes in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Ken Watanabe is on hand as a token Japanese character who has a perpetual worried look on his face.<br/><br/>In case anyone was wondering, for the umpteenth time in an SF film the Golden Gate Bridge cops a flogging again. And the odd tsunami (which has become THE go-to disaster vehicle of the 2010's) pops up to add extra havoc to the general goings on.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious I was unimpressed with Godzilla. But I have to admit the big guy still has his rabid following around the world, especially in the Asian markets, which helped the film make a marginal profit.All I can say, is that these audiences are very easily satisfied by a very ordinary film."
"brandon_foore","9","0","1","9 December 2018"," Return of the King
","Ive long been a Godzilla fan, Ive seen almost every movie and the original one from 1954 still hails as a classic in my opinion and while there was some things that could have been done better in this movie, I still feel like this movie was/is one of the best movies of 2014 and marked a successful return for the King to America. Yeah, some could say that holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too ""human centered"" movie. Taylor-Johnson is passable and Olsen is also enjoyable but other than Cranston, Hawkins, Strathairn and Watanabe the movie could have benefited from a better lead actor who could take command of the screen while not feeling like such an emotionless rock someone like Chris Pratt, Matt Damon (doubt he would do it) or even a Tom Hardy would have been much better suited for the role than Aaron Johnson. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title character around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning) which is why I didn't have an issue with it. But on the flip side, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done alot better then the simple ""lets nuke em"" approach. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done. Say what you want about Godzilla's screen time but you can definitely feel his presence being felt as they cleverly took a page out of classic movies like ""Jaws,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" at holding their biggest and baddest monster back, allowing you to feel his presence off screen before unleashing him onscreen."

If a Godzilla fan walks up to you and tells you it sucks, because Godzilla isn't in the movie that much and the human story is boring, they're not worth listening to. That's how it goes in almost all of the Japanese movies and no one ever complains about that, so they're just being biased...and they won't admit it. Granted the movie is a little slow, but I've never felt this much suspense in a Godzilla movie since I watched the 1954 movie...and I've seen every Godzilla movie that's come out so far!

"darth-tobe","3","0","1","24 March 2018"," Not much Godzilla for your money
","Visually this version of Godzilla is pretty impressive. And most of the last 25 minutes or so are quite cool. There, that's all I can see that the movie has going for it. Hollywood took 18 years to try again and remake the Japanese classic. Let me say they are still struggling.<br/><br/>It's as if studios were criticized once too often that blockbusters lack characters so now they cram sad excuses for characters into every movie and forget what it was supposed to be about. Think of Transformers which fed viewers the personal life of Sam Witwicky instead of fighting robots (or their characters). Think of Iron Man 3 which was about the personal struggles of Tony Stark instead of, well, Iron Man. This Godzilla is about an American soldier and bomb expert and his relationship with his beautiful wife and little son who miss him a lot because he's away a lot. It's also about his relationship with his father who went a bit cooky after loosing his wife. The movie is also about the US military who are mainly there to look cool and fail heroically. It's furthermore about the Japanese scientist who has been studying Godzilla, has some unexplained motivation and is mainly there to look concerned. Do you realize which character I've been leaving out so far? Yes, it is, of course, Godzilla, the literal father of all ""dai kaiju"". I am sorry to report that he doesn't appear very much in what's supposed to be his own movie. In fact, you could probably skip to the 90 minute mark and not miss much of him. There is a new kaiju, which vaguely reminds me of Mothra, and it seems to get more screen time than Godzilla.<br/><br/>Another reviewer compares this to old horror films, like Jaws, that (driven also by technical limitations of the time) would tease the viewer with glimpses of the monster until the climatic reveal. I disagree. In Jaws you would not see the shark but it would always make its presence felt - it would kill people. Actually, think of Cloverfield as a kaiju movie in which, I think, both the focus on the people and the monster-teasing worked pretty well. You get some backstory of the characters but from then on the monster's presence drives everything they do.<br/><br/>I'd recommend Shin Gojira instead of this one."

","Hard to believe that a Godzilla movie could be dull, but this is dull. 
The production team makes the mistake of modern movie making. They try to confuse the audience with a bunch of special effects that make you feel the headache of an annoying arcade or a goofy casino full of those annoying lights flashing over and over.
Pretty much everything is contrived for the sake of what little the writer and director have in mind. We never feel we're there. We only feel we're in the presence of people making a movie, and that's a poor sign.
If you can stay awake for the first two hundred years of this movie (it will seem like two hundred years), you'll finally see a monster. 
The biggest problem is we just get the same characters over and over. Hollywood thinks all men have to be married with families, or they're worthless garbage. Again and again, we are alienated by Hollywood ""superiority"" complexes.
Not pathetic, but this movie is tedious and annoying."

I really do not like this Godzilla.<br/><br/>First of all the monsters are all implausibly big. I get how fun is derived from giant monsters, but not only do these monsters have their heads in the clouds, the tone of the film is incredibly serious. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield a lot of the time.

It has been treated as an art film that explores the non-exhaustive facets of society. Is this because the original Godzilla was about nuclear weapons and how terrible they are? So therefore this film must have some serious message to get across?<br/><br/>It doesn't. If anything it seems to be for everything the original film was against.<br/><br/>I'm tired of darkly-lit, implausible, thick-headed, dim-witted, CGI-ridden, factory-produced let-downs like this.

","Being that most reviews here are negative and written by fans who want things to be done by the book, I feel like there are also different points of view from people who don't care about the original story and are just looking for entertainment.<br/><br/>This Godzilla movie is not bad at all. I don't think any Godzilla movie is a masterpiece, far from that, but this 2014 is a good pop corn disaster colossal yelling monsters hard to put down with conventional weapon artillery. The monsters are well done, the buildings are as solid as tree leaves and crumble in slow motion as it should due to the inertia momentum of heavy materials and there are OK fights between Godzilla and his natural opponents. This 'another scale' fights could have been more dramatic and gory but we feel at all moments that the movie director wanted to preserve the most highrise buildings in the city so perhaps this is the reason why he shortened a little the fights. Plus, how would they manage to clean the streets if there were several artificial lakes of monster blood spilled all over the place. So keep it realistic. Still when Godzilla or some other nuclearily zoomed cockroach sneezes there is little in the way to save in matters of high-rise buildings glasses or some trendy penthouse terraces. Plus, these rather clumsy entities don't care much about keeping moving along the sidewalk like any educated 20th century individual so a certain level of collateral damages similar to those produced by a 9.5 magnitude degree earthquake is naturally to be expected.<br/><br/>Finally, we can now easily blame the US army generals, and for a good reason. These guys joggle with nuclear heads like I do with two oranges (when I manage not to drop both of them on the floor). Seriously, trowing in the middle of the city some cracker capable of wiping an area covering several phone area codes then having a soldiers team going to rescue the ticking bomb? Why didn't they just put the toy in a UPS truck just passing by. But even then, Godzilla is still not far away from there, acting around and checking the situation with a more or less attentive eye. He's the real hero, and no, he doesn't drink Coca-Cola when the job is done, nor does he eat at perhaps the only remaining McDonald's in the city. He just takes a dip in the pool, sorry ocean, and swims away like any regular guy in a hot torrid Sunday afternoon. Minus the swimming gear."

If it costs you nothing and you are at home just watching it because it's there than maybe. But do NOT waste any money buying a DVD or on AMAZON or anything like that because you will be a very angry Joe if you have to pay ANY money for this trash.<br/><br/>The sound affects and the make up effects for GZ are good. They generally scared me at some points of the movie. But if i'm being honest that's the only thing going for the entire film. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting is quite good especially for the emotional parts of the movie and so is Cranston's acting but you can tell it's made up. <br/><br/>The story line was just plain stupid. Blah, blah, blah three monsters, blah blah blah. You probably understand. The worst thing for me was that the film BASICALLY isn't even ABOUT GODZILLA. GZ only appears like half way to three quarters of the movie. It's more about the other creatures that appear in the first half. <br/><br/>Now the ending isn't too bad, and I won't say too much for you folks that haven't seen this but it's just terrible. The normal happy ending blah blah blah. The film ends with GZ, and you can't even really tell whats going on. Also, the film doesn't even finish with a 'the end' nothing happens for like 3 seconds then BAM! with the dramatic music and credits then that's it.<br/><br/>To conclude, unless you like wasting money or time, don't watch this film. And if you do end up watching this film, be prepared to be annoyed."

","I saw this movie last year and really liked it. Quite different than any Godzilla movies I watched as a kid. There's much more of a story told from the character's viewpoint and the final battle scene was worth watching the entire movie. I found Elizabeth Olson's character and that of her son's character to be essential worthless. That's not a knock on the actors, just a knock on their roles. They don't really add anything except a love/family angle to the story. That's been overdone in blockbuster movies and less of that, more of the scientists interacting and discussing Godzilla's origin/nature would have been better. Taylor's soldier/son/husband character could have used a bit more depth as well. He's just kind of running in place with his role throughout. Overall, it's a fun movie and the giant monster battle scenes are good. I give it a 6 out of 10. Not a great movie but a good one."

In this film when you see Godzilla, however rare it might be is awe inspiring, the shots of him really make you think, ""Oh god that is absolutely huge"" and its always epic when he is on screen. The acting was mostly great although at times Aaron Taylor Johnson was a bit dull, he portrayed a soldier fairly well, easily the best performance was by Brian Cranston who was so entertaining to watch, in the first few minutes we watch him In a nuclear meltdown in a power plant in Japan.

","The 1998 film was a rehash of the original 1954 film whereas this 2014 film gets its inspiration from the later Godzilla vs X films of the 70s by which time the monster had become a good guy.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good and the special effects are nice though it could have done with double the $160m budget. The story of the main characters does nicely develop over the course of the two hours.<br/><br/>There is a nice plot build up and lots of action and adventure. The cast is huge. There are lots of little nods to events in other Godzilla stories.<br/><br/>The bad stuff: No humour. It's mostly filmed in the dark (possibly to make the SFX cheaper) and on a small screen you will often struggle to see what's going on.

","I didn't watch this as a godzilla movie, but rather the new movie from the director of Monsters. Monsters was one of the best movies to come out in a long time for me. Perfect mixture of drama, visuals, sci-fi and great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Godzilla started well, interesting plot, good visuals, intriguing. The atmosphere was great. Only it kind of lost the charm half way through. I can see what the director was going for, but the problem is that the drama and human factor fell flat. Yes, sounds quite weird for a monster movie, but big part of the directors Monsters charm was the chemistry between the leads and the fact that there wasn't that much of the monsters, but rather it was about the characters and their story.<br/><br/>It's quite fair to say that the turning point is when the dad dies. The plot was interesting up until that point, but after that nothing interesting really happens plot wise. It goes into action genre, although it's kind of slowish action.<br/><br/>Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't very interesting as the lead and clearly did not have that much to build on either. You might say he doesn't even have that much of a purpose in the whole movie, even the scientists - who also were seriously under- developed - were more interesting. Elizabeth Olsen is a good actress, but she also had quite little to work on. The director went for a low key action drama, which works up to a point, but the script is a bit weak towards the end.<br/><br/>Atmosphere and style very good, drama and human factor not too good.<br/><br/>Still looking forward to seeing Gareth Edwards' Star Wars entry Rogue One."

","Alright kids, this time around I am going toe to toe with the King of all Monsters himself, Godzilla. Now I'll wait for that slight pause as you wonder if it's the shiny new reboot or the Matthew Broderick iguana movie from the 90's if you're still not sure then you didn't read the year at the top of the screen before you began this journey, shame on you Oh, I'm sorry. I just can't stay mad at you. Now back to our movie.<br/><br/>This is a difficult film to review without giving away a slew of spoiler info but I'll do my damnedest to not ruin it. Here goes, a massive accident at a Japanese nuclear power plant causes the quarantine of both the plant and the neighboring community. Joe Brody (played by verbosely well by Bryan Cranston), a supervisor at the plant, loses his wife when the reactor blows (It's in the trailer so I'm going to call 'no spoiler' on this one). Obsessed with this possibly being more than a mere meltdown, he spends the next fifteen years uncovering what he can about the quarantine zone and what the government is hiding there.<br/><br/>After being arrested for trespassing in the quarantine zone, he is bailed out by his son Ford, a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Fed up with his father's quest for the truth he decides to head back home to San Francisco to be with his wife (Elizabeth Olen) and son. During a layover in Hawaii, Ford comes face to face with what his father feared most now see, a spoiler would be great right about now but I'm not going to do it. Let's just say the ball starts rolling and this movie introduces the Godzilla element we all remember from the rubber-suited monster flicks of yester year"
"michael-3204","7","0","2","16 January 2016"," A worthy update
","There is a lot to criticize about the most recent reboot of one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history. The basic premise concerning ancient giant creatures that feed on radiation is preposterous, the human characters are thin and behave in ways that don't make sense, the coincidences the story asks us to swallow are almost as big as the title creature, and the tonality of the performances is all over the map. Bryan Cranston cranks himself to 11 (his scenes with a natural talent like Juliette Binoche demonstrate how outclassed he is as an actor), Ken Watanable spends a lot of time staring wistfully and forlornly into space, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems set on sucking the life out of any scene he's in. Even the score by the usually reliable Alexander Desplat is forgettable. Yet despite all the flaws, this film has one awesome quiver in its bow and it knows how to use it, making it eminently watchable and entertaining. This is a super-sized Godzilla largely indifferent to humans and humanity, and as such is perfect update to the anxieties explored and exploited in the Toho original. In place of fears about unleashing the destructive power of the atom, now we quiver in the shadow of natural forces we monkey with but don't completely understand, forces capable of wiping us out while barely noticing us. Director Gareth Edwards and his army of visual effects and sound design gurus make sure that Godzilla lives up to his name and legacy. Yes, it could be a better film if the humans had more depth and the story wasn't so contrived, but it wouldn't be worth anything if that thrilling roar wasn't so convincing, the blast of hot breath so exciting, and the earth-shaking power not so awesome. The film delivers in a big way on the one character that really matters."
"skyminster","5","0","2","27 November 2015"," An alright film, and that's all.
","Godzilla, eh? Oh yeah, that film, the one that wasn't that great and everyone sort of forgot about, right? Yeah, sort of – though it did get some serious slating from a certain someone. Nonetheless, I got it on Blu-ray at, I think, last Christmas, and I hadn't watched it, and decided to watch it the other day — over a year since I last watched it, in the cinema. Ah those were good times. Wait, what? Oh yeah, the review! Here goes<br/><br/>For a disappointing film, it certainly starts very well; with a great setting and introductions to seemingly great characters, one being acted by the now famous Bryan Cranston (as of Breaking Bad, although he was obviously his best in Malcolm in the Middle). He was fantastic, and acted a great character (Joe Brody), who in dramatic scenes at the start of the film blossomed. However, as the film introduces you to its slow pace, boring military guys and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as the relatively uninteresting, older kid who was in the start of the film (Lieutenant Ford): it suddenly goes from great to mediocre, if not a little bad. And, (sorry, but this has to be included in the review), after about 35 minutes or so of screen time, Bryan Cranston goes and dies, a very anticlimactic death, which gives his slightly boring son the undeserved limelight. And that does make me a bit angry.<br/><br/>As the film goes on, suspense it built, and it is built pretty well. But where's Godzilla? Yes, I understanding they were trying to save the best till last, but, seriously, it's named after him, and the few and far between parts of the film he stars in are fantastic — so why isn't he in it more? Instead, the Mutos grab most of the attention, which are cool, and do some cool stuff, and are the result of fantastic special effects; but there is not enough of them or Godzilla, instead there is too much of military guys talking about them and people watching news videos of them crashing down the Eiffel Tower – which was a particularly uninventive scene.<br/><br/>Furthermore, most of the film's set in America, which is certainly a bit boring, and lazy, I think; but most importantly it doesn't stick to Godzilla's heritage, bar a few Japanese little things here and there and about 20 minutes set there. Godzilla's a Japanese thing. Come on. But that isn't so big a flaw as the film's length, which is unacceptably long for the amount of content actually in it.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film has a great score, there are cool bits here and there, and there is a great climax towards the end, Pacific Rim style – if a bit less ridiculously cool — and the start of the film is great.<br/><br/>But no one can argue that it's a flawed film. It is too long, with too little Bryan Cranston, Japan, and Godzilla, and too much random military guys who do nothing and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.<br/><br/>It's not a glowing endorsement of Gareth Edwards, but I don't understand some of the slating it's got. However disappointing it is, Godzilla is an alright film.<br/><br/>So I give it: 60/100."

The power plant was destroyed because of a radiation leak and nobody was allowed there for 15 years.The radiation leak killed the wife, but the husband and son survived. The boy grew up and joined the army, and the husband stayed behind in Japan to investigate the cause of the accident. It turned out that the cause was M.U.T.O.

The ending was very spectacular, there is a fight between the monsters which was really cool. And after watching Pacific Rim which had ""hundreds"" of monster fights. I was actually happy that Godzilla didn't have that many fights, because I felt that there was to many fights in Pacific Rim, which made them really boring. So the fight in Godzilla made a much bigger impact on me than any of the fights in Pacific Rim. End of Spoiler!!!<br/><br/>The movie was way to long, and most of the characters were really poorly written. It wasn't the worst movie I've watched this year, but I was really disappointed. Im not sure of what I was expecting, but I was pretty annoyed when the movie was over. This was a very mediocre movie 5.5/10<br/><br/>http://stiannielsfilm.blogspot.no/"
"jephtha","7","0","2","28 August 2015"," Well made and shows great promise for the future, but suffers from curious defects
","Watching Godzilla (2014) for the fifth time, I was surprised by how consistent the trend of new observations has been with each repeat viewing. I don't say this to uphold the movie as a particularly deep piece of work; even I wouldn't go that far. It's simply to observe that, for a summer blockbuster, the nuclear menace's modern update boasts a surprising amount of re-watch value.<br/><br/>If there's anything I've had to ask myself for the last year, it's WHY did it have to be THIS film that suffered from universally recognized missteps? I was never too driven to discuss them at length because many, MANY others had already done that dirty work. The lamentation from this latest viewing has changed that, the operative word being ""lamentation"", not frustration. Much of the basis for this resides in the first half-hour, before the uncalled for death of the most interesting character. Yes, killing off Bryan Cranston's character was a mistake, because not only did he churn out the best performance; he was also personally affected by the existence of these giant monsters, a trait that bolsters many of the better entries in this genre. Yet, lost opportunities within this first segment of the movie extend beyond that, such that I would argue that the movie wasn't necessarily lost without him.<br/><br/>Consider the scenes with Ford and Elle Brody. They're certainly conventional as far as portraying the affection within a marriage, but it works, and it's the kind of stuff that the Godzilla series has been devoid of from the start. Had these two been allowed to interact more, this could have been an interesting illustration of spouses strengthening each other during a time of crisis. In fact, other notable relationships are established in the first half-hour. The scenes with Joe and Ford demonstrate a convincing father/son dynamic, within the context of great personal loss. Heck, with that loss we already have a motivation for Ford, who was effectively robbed of BOTH parents by these creatures. There's so much to be admired in this part of the movie, and so much to lament because so little of it carried over to the rest. That first half-hour is such a good basis for a monster movie that, even without Cranston's character, had there been follow-through ""Godzilla (2014)"" would have approached the upper echelons of the genre.<br/><br/>The middle act is choppy in comparison. It doesn't concern itself with any central character and often scrambles about trying to explain everything. That being said, the exposition is interesting, especially since the monster threat is constant. More concern is evident for simply making these people vanilla flavored good guys, which teeters between uninteresting and annoying. The military is particularly groan-inducing; I guess it's an unspoken rule in these movies that members of the military are incompetent or pompous. Admiral Stenz has presence, though, and Serizawa seems genuinely fascinated by the situation. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them in the sequels.<br/><br/>All that aside, the ultimate triumph of the movie are the monsters themselves. From a technical standpoint, these are perhaps the best portrayals of giant monsters to date, and the one thing that carries over from the first act. The sense of scale is undeniable. Even the male MUTO, a shrimp by giant monster standards, feels bigger than most of the kaiju from ""Pacific Rim"". On top of that, just about every scene that these things appear in is atmospheric and tense. Consider the scene on the railroad bridge, where the female MUTO easily towers over the man made structure. Say what you will about Gareth Edwards' slow burn approach, but the guy knows how to give the impression of actually encountering one of these things.<br/><br/>As for the main attraction himself, it would feel redundant to affirm the sheer magnificence Godzilla is infused with. His presence is lacking for the first 40 minutes or so, but it does steadily increase. We first glimpse him in the (very good) opening credits, later learn more about him from the researchers, see his first full-fledged appearance that is excellently built up to, and finally he shows up for the climax. Echoing practically the rest of the world, I would have preferred for the movie to focus more on him, but every second he is on screen is nothing short of astounding. The increased bulk and longer tail complement each other well, while the mouth grants a more reptilian, almost snake-like appearance. Other welcome tweaks include the spines glowing in segments, which is a marvelous sight, and hints of intelligence, evident from his avoidance of the aircraft carriers and the innovative finishing strike. Perhaps most notable is the reinvention of Godzilla's image as the force of nature that maintains balance. It has a relative reverence that allows him to be a hero without becoming cheesy, and may prove fruitful for later exploration regarding humanity's opinions of him.<br/><br/>Allow me a second to comment on one of the more understated technical aspects: the sound design. As all six of the Star Wars films have demonstrated, visuals are at their best when complemented by the right sound, and that is consistently done here. Godzilla's classic roar has received a fittingly teeth-shaking update, while the MUTO are both given a unique and versatile roar that is their best feature. One might say that these help give the monsters distinct ""personalities"". Other sounds, such as the EMP attack and the whirring that accompanies the glowing spines, are also effective.<br/><br/>This is a good new start for the King of the Monsters, and one of the better blockbusters of the previous summer (second to ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes""). The doors are open for such developments as a more complex relationship between monster and human or the capacity that crisis has to divide individuals or unite them. That is what I hope the next film will be about."
"Zeta-One","9","0","3","19 August 2015"," Godzilla 2014: An Exciting Ride
","I was quite impressed by Godzilla (2014), as it surpassed my expectations and was an exciting ride from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>Godzilla (2014) is mostly placed in the modern day, where a creature, known as Godzilla, is hidden from the public eye by the government since 1954. However, fifteen years after the discovery of the Godzilla, two more creatures, known as MUTO's, wreck havoc in the city, along with Godzilla. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), is a Navy officer who works alongside the Navy to stop these monsters. However, when the monsters head to San Francisco, he must face the responsibility of defeating these monsters and protecting his wife, Elle Brody (Elizabeth Olsen), his son, Sam Brody (Carson Bolde), and the whole world from the danger these creatures can bring.<br/><br/>To start off, Godzilla himself was not seen in the first half of the film, besides in short glimpses at his basic design. However, it adds suspense to the film, and makes you wonder how he looks like. The design on Godzilla was well done, and believable for the most part. The old lizard look is still there, but there is a modern feel to the character as well. I believe the way the made Godzilla on the screen was spectacular, and it couldn't be done any better.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was pretty good, and the actors/actresses seemed to fit in their roles. The actors managed to let their acting go with the flow, making the film more enjoyable and easier to watch. The CGI in this film was also impressive, especially in the design for Godzilla (stated above). The other two monsters looked realistic as well. This film perhaps has one of the best CGI I've seen so far, in 2014 and 2015 films combined. <br/><br/>There was excellent character development in the film, and you really got to connect to them. Characters such as Ford had a long backstory since the beginning of the film, and that helped make you understand his character more than you would without. The only problem about this film was that action was okay to good. It was pretty ordinary, and nothing was surprising or very impressive. Godzilla didn't really have an action scene until near the middle of the movie, which was a disappointing factor for me. When he finally does appear in the film, however, he is given mediocre actions scenes against both the humans and the MUTO's. Although there is room for improvement, the action scenes were at the very least, satisfying, and added an interesting touch to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this film easily surpassed the standards for a Godzilla movie. It was fun, thrilling, and was an exciting ride from start to finish. Although the action scenes were mediocre, the acting, character development, and storyline makes up for it. If you want to watch an interesting and well made monster film, do yourself a favor and watch this. This is the Godzilla film all the Godzilla fans have been looking for."
"bryank-04844","8","0","3","17 August 2015"," 'Godzilla' is definitely back in a big way,
","And that is what Edwards focused on here with his $160 million dollar version of Godzilla. There are virtually no comedic lines or quips in the two-hour run time of this reboot, which I think this 'Godzilla' remake could have used maybe just a hint of instead of being somber the entire time. I almost wanted Batman's arch nemesis The Joker to show up at some point and say ""Why so serious?""<br/><br/>We start out with some vintage footage of nuclear bomb ""tests"" and head straight into a similar opening to 'Jurassic Park', where we meet Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), a scientist and his cohort Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) as they land via helicopter on an island in the middle of a major dig to discover the bone remains of something the size of a skyscraper. Meanwhile in Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a nuclear physicist and engineer at the Janjira nuclear plant and his wife Sandy (Juliette Binoche), another engineer at the plant discover strange seismic extractions and noises getting stronger and louder every hour. Most people think it's an earthquake, but Joe thinks its something worse that ""will send us back to the stone age.""<br/><br/>We cut fifteen years later where Joe and Sandy's kid, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has a family of his own and is called to retrieve his father from Japan who has become reclusive and some sort of nutcase whose apartment walls are riddled with articles, images, and memos of what he's been working on for the past twenty or more years and still trying to prove what caused the Janjira plant to fall to ashes fifteen years ago. Once Ford and Joe are reunited, Joe's theories become true as we see a M.U.T.O., short for a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism escape from an underground bunker and fly off in the sky, but not before causing tons of destruction.<br/><br/>This M.U.T.O. has long insect like legs, red evil eyes, and one bad attitude. Unfortunately, this giant creature looks part robot and part insect and has no character definition whatsoever other than roaring sometimes. This is when more seismic activity comes up on everybody's computer as Godzilla has awakened and has headed towards this M.U.T.O. This M.U.T.O. has two things on its mind. It needs to feed and lay eggs. It's source of food is nuclear and senses out every nuclear warhead, missile and base that it can to eat. It also finds the male version to itself so it can breed along the way, which leads into a giant 2-on-1 steel cage match between the two M.U.T.O.'s and Godzilla himself in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Edwards is an expert with his camera and captures the carnage brilliantly as fighter jets crash into buildings and men in parachutes try to dodge the chaos on the ground, all while three giant monsters are battling it out. It's quite spectacular. However, we don't fully see Godzilla until maybe halfway through the film, which is unfortunate since this is 'Godzilla'. But when he's on camera, does he own every aspect of that screen. He's a little big bigger and a little bit beefier than before, and is a beautiful creature not to be messed with. Even Godzilla's eyes speak in volume to what he is feeling. I only hope that if future films are to come of this franchise, they show more of Godzilla in action.<br/><br/>In addition to the very serious tone with this is the inability to connect with any of the characters besides Cranston's Joe who turns in a great performance. I can't say the same for anyone else though. Johnson could have been played by any hot male action star and had no direction or depth at all as he tried to diffuse bombs for the navy and help people along the way during the monster attacks. And Watanabe can only be seen in long distant glares at the chaos that was unfolding and uttering lines like ""Let them fight"", which was an homage to the sillier sequels from the past. And Ford's wife who is played by Elizabeth Olsen is good, but is not given much to work with and plays a frantic mother and wife for short spurts.<br/><br/>But luckily, Edwards keeps the pace moving despite these things with great and beautiful action sequences in Hawaii and Las Vegas, before the ultimate San Francisco showdown. I just wish it took some of the characters a little while longer to accomplish certain tasks or be in a certain place rather than it happening on the first try every time. It took the realness out of the whole equation as odd as that may seem with this movie.<br/><br/>All that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this 'Godzilla' and has no resemblance to the 1998 reboot from director Roland Emmerich that starred Matthew Broderick. In fact, it's okay to completely forget that film was ever made. Evan's 'Godzilla' is a visual masterpiece and one of the finest monster and action films of all time. Nobody can make this amount of destruction look so beautiful and magnificent like Edwards. And even though we don't get tons of time with Godzilla, the time we do is insanely fun and epic, which composer Alexandre Desplat's score adds a lot of suspense and fun to the entire film.<br/><br/>We have to see how well this one does first at the box office, which I hope scores big for weeks to come, because 'Godzilla' is definitely back and BADASS!"

"beej44","1","0","2","27 July 2015"," By the numbers, tepid tosh
","If only Seth McFarlane or the Zucker brothers would have a go at a movie like this. At least there'd be a giggle or two.<br/><br/>So much wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start so I'll make an orderly list.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>1) The two Muto creatures looked more metallic than flesh and blood. whoever designed the creatures needs to take a course in basic entomology as I assume they were supposed to be insect based. A 5 year old with some plasticine and a crocodile clip could have created a more convincing monster. Godzilla too was farcical, I mean a gigantic dinosaur with the head the size of a pea.<br/><br/>2) Towards the end Godzilla was losing the fight against the two Muto's but they were distracted by the burning of their egg chamber (nice steal from Aliens) and they left Godzilla alive. A little later a recovered Godzilla suddenly remembers that he can breathe fire and so quite easily kills his two monstrous enemies in their next encounters. Why not use the fire breathing weapon in the earlier fight?<br/><br/>3) People are sat in homes and bars watching 24/7 news coverage of these three enormous monsters rampaging over their cities but then seem shocked and horrified when the roof of their building collapses under the weight of a Mutu. How did they not know that the monster was just down the road? They were watching it all on live TV for god's sake.<br/><br/>4) Our hero is left in charge of a little Japanese boy who gets separated from his parents in the panic. Later they arrive at an area full of tens of thousands of displaced people and the little boy wanders off and finds his parents straight away. Yeah right.<br/><br/>5) People walk around unprotected in areas that would be so highly radioactive your skin would melt from your skin (and I'm not talking about the earlier scene where Brian Cranstone returned to where his wife had died).<br/><br/>I could say so much more. Suffice to say this version of Godzilla was a witless, artless, clueless insult to the intelligence. If it had included any wit at all or adopted a tongue-in-cheek attitude it might have been an OK popcorn movie. However it is so po-faced and earnest in the handling of this preposterous nonsense that you just end up laughing all the way through it anyway.<br/><br/>I can only imagine that Brian Cranstone and Juliet Binoche begged to be killed off early so they could escape the stigma of being too closely connected to this dogs breakfast of a movie. The great David Strathhairn too should've known better."
"oconnerrev","4","0","1","23 July 2015"," Problems with the plot
","The movie has three large animals, two radiation absorbing organism and one big godzilla. In the whole movie I didn't understand why godzilla was regarded as the hero. The only problem with all of these organism is their size which causes a lot of damage to the life and property when they move about. Except for that neither have any in born enmity for the humans and one of the benefit of the two MUTO (radiation absorbing organism) is that they can absorb radiations. Think of them being genetically re-engineered to be small and left to feed on radiation of old power plants and leakage sites.<br/><br/>Anyway the godzilla still seems to be the hero by killing the two monsters and destroying more city in the process than those MUTOs ever did."
"highmesa","1","0","2","19 July 2015"," Lost opportunity
","Initially in this story we were presented with husband and wife scientists played by the great actors Bryan Cranston and Julliette Binoche. This movie might have continued the tradition of scientist as hero, dating from It Came From Outer Space and Creature from the Black Lagoon, and continuing through Jurassic Park. This would have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these two characters were phased out early in the story, and their son turned out to be the main character. Instead of a smart scientist, he's a dumb warrior. Instead of Sam Neill and Laura Dern, we got Rocky Balboa.<br/><br/>I blame James Cameron. Working class people are the heroes in his Terminator movies and Aliens and The Abyss and Avatar. The theme of his movie Titanic was that working class people are better in every way than upper class people.<br/><br/>For a key sequence in Godzilla, the high altitude drop, the film makers chose as background music the same piece by Ligeti that Stanley Kurbrick used when Heywood Floyd was shown the monolith on the Moon in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Godzilla film makers seemed to say, we have no imagination of our own so we're stealing from a better film maker. If you don't agree, please point to anything at all in Godzilla that shows that the film makers had an imagination.<br/><br/>(Was this music choice another unfortunate Cameron influence? The music in the opening salvage scene in Aliens was the same Khachaturian music that Kubrick used brilliantly when introducing the Jupiter mission spacecraft in Space Odyssey. These music choices were brilliant in Space Odyssey; not so in Godzilla or Aliens.)<br/><br/>This movie is top-heavy with special effects. It lacks imagination and intelligence and characters we care about or even like."

There are beyond doubt some amazing sequences of Godzilla and the other two monsters battling it out and destroying countless building on the way, but it ins't what the movie focuses on. Godzilla seems to be sidelined in his own movie.<br/><br/>Godzilla focuses on Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen's characters and their relationship. There is plenty of family drama when Bryan Cranston's character's wife dies and when Bryan Cranston's character dies himself.<br/><br/>Over all Godzilla is a great movie definitely worth watching and buying on Blu-Ray.

Bryan Cranston saves his career by only appearing in the decently appealing first 30 minutes or so. <br/><br/>Plot: well, I must say it makes the 1998 movie look really good.

","Really looking forward to a far superior version than the underrated Matthew Broderick Godzilla. More modern and edgier with a far greater fear of peril. However I was very very disappointed. Started promisingly with Bryan Cranston's character and his apparent paranoia over the death of his wife and a cover up involved. Whilst the story centred around him it was an interesting slow burner. However when it shifts to Johnson as the main character that is where the film starts to die a death. He was great in KickAss as an underdog but simply awful and wooden as the main hero of the plot. His range of emotions and expressions are simply not there. A raised eyebrow here and an attempt at angst or fear was just unbelievable. But this wasn't the only gripe about the last hour or so. The main one is the film is just too dark to follow. You cannot really see the special effects and as a result it is confusing and lacks care. A lot of promises but sadly like finding a coffee cream in your box of chocolates. Looked good and promising enough to begin but goes sour and unsatisfying."

With the CGI today we don't need to hide the big monsters that could seem fake away, because they are really realistic, in the way they look, in the way they move and how they affect their surroundings. I think this has been done very well and even though their is a lot of dark places, it is only to help the imagination kick into overdrive, when these big giants fight :)<br/><br/>I was entertained, the entire build up was very elaborate and believable, it was a good introduction to the film and the genre and how it was tried to cover things up with events that actually have happened.

"ohashmawi","Null","0","4","24 January 2015"," Pretty cool the first time, gets worse as you watch it more. Also, too much teasing.
","Holy crap. Godzilla, it's finally here! Since the beginning of 2013 I had been waiting, one of the films that I've anticipated the most, and when I finally watched it, I was blown away, it was incredible. I got something a bit different than what I expected (as in the focus of it) but I still loved it. And then when the excitement died down, I realized that the movie isn't a perfect ten like I thought.<br/><br/>The acting in Godzilla is really good, but more as a whole, because there is only 1 person who gave an absolutely spectacular performance, and that person is the always amazing, Bryan Cranston. That man is one of the best actors in the business. The scene at the beginning in the nuclear plant, where he has to make a very hard decision, that was the most heartfelt moment I've seen this year. I really wish he had more screen time, he was pretty much the only character I actually cared about. His wife, Juliette Binoche is really good as well, like Bryan, she doesn't appear much on the screen, but she's great when she's on it. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is decent in the movie, he plays that generic badass lucky-as-hell military guy. He doesn't emote much, but he plays his part well. Elizabeth Olsen, his wife, is talented for sure, but she doesn't have that much to do. The rest of the supporting cast is good as well, they just play the generic monster movie characters. What I really liked here is that there's not a false note anywhere in the acting, you could tell that every single person took it seriously.<br/><br/>The script for this movie is good, they made an interesting and compelling story, they even managed to make it coherent to the 1954 original, I thought that was really cool. Also, this movie may be called ""Godzilla"" but it's not really about him, it's more about the human drama, the people dealing with the fact that there are monsters who are destroying everything. I had a love-hate relationship with all the teasing in this movie, all the suspense was cool, so was Godzilla's fearsome off-screen presence, but I was still really frustrated when they didn't show some of the fights. The first time it was okay, but twice? Seriously? It's just like, why the hell do you think people came to see this movie? Anyway, the film is very realistic, it all looks devastating, and you have to give the director credit for it. Godzilla doesn't grab a boat and uses it as a baseball bat, but what he does instead is WAY cooler. Speaking of the big guy, the movie holds him back for quite a bit, for the first hour it mainly just teases him, but when he first appears, that shot that travels from his legs all the way to his head, and then he lets out that awesome roar! Man, I was clapping and cheering so much, seriously, I just couldn't contain myself. I think they should have teased him less, we only see him fight in the final act, and he has 2 other confrontations which they don't show (total BS), it probably won't please people who prefers fast story-telling , but it pays off in the third act, when the monster fight begins, it is really, really awesome. <br/><br/>The director, Gareth Edwards, deserves a lot of praise for this movie, which I hope he gets (he will from me at least). Everything looks beautiful, and not just the visual effects, every shot is done really well, it really shows the devastating consequences a monster attack would have, you feel the desolation Godzilla and the MUTOs leave in their wake with every image. He made it very eerie and suspenseful, and that worked really well for the movie's tone. And don't get me started on the CGI and visual effects, they are amazing, the sound is also really great, the monster roars just seemed to shake the theater. All technical aspects of this movie are incredible. The soundtrack is amazing! Alexandre Desplat and the editing crew deserve an Oscar for the opening credits alone! Hearing that track again made me feel the excitement all over again. I loved what they did with Godzilla the character, they made him very intimidating, vicious, badass and kind of scary.<br/><br/>I had few complaints with this movie, but they were kind of big, the first one is that the movie could have had a bit less teasing, they could have showed us more of the second act. The second complaint is that Bryan Cranston was the only interesting character, he was the only one who really emoted, the rest of the cast is great too, but they could have been a bit more emotional. <br/><br/>This movie is pretty cool, I simply loved it (the first time of course). With repeated viewings though, it loses its spark, much like The Avengers, an awesome movie that was amazing the first time you saw it, then less when you watch it more. If you liked Pacific Rim, and you're looking for something similar, then you might be disappointed, it's a lot more realistic, the monster fight is glorious, even more so than Pacific Rim, but it has a lot less awesome battles, it focuses more on the human drama, kind of like The Walking Dead, it has zombies, but it doesn't focus on them, it shows humans having to survive in a world with zombies. The story is very interesting, the script is good, the acting is very good, no false notes anywhere, the visual effects are spectacular. If you want a human drama which has freaking Godzilla in it, then watch this movie, just remember, don't expect Godzilla to fight a lot, which is likely to disappoint you. Still, Godzilla is overall a good movie."

The main character, Ford, was poorly written and acted and his wife, played by Elizabeth Olsen, was such a lame character. Even their kid was used poorly and gave nothing to the story.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, the darkness of the film was too much and Godzilla did not get enough screen time. I thought the special effects were good, but Godzilla should have been shown in longer than 90 second clips.

And that's the case in this 2014 version as well, but that's okay because he's on our side, I think.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Godzilla taking on a couple of like-size monsters called MUTOs (""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms"") and the destruction of one city after another in Japan, Hawaii and mainland America. While these fights don't occur until the second half of the movie, the CGI is great, as is the all-around filmmaking. There's nothing wrong on this front.<br/><br/>It's the human characters and their story where the film is mediocre. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the main protagonist, Elizabeth Olsen his wife, and Bryan Cranston his father. Also on hand are Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Richard T. Jones and Sally Hawkins. These actors are all perfectly competent, but the story-as-written never makes 'em click as interesting characters. As such, they're bland. And, since the first half of the movie is focused on the build-up to the monsters, it's more boring than compelling.<br/><br/>Still, it is Godzilla and there are some memorable disaster-oriented moments.<br/><br/>The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Honolulu, British Columbia and Nevada.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"

","I watched this movie for 2 reasons: 1.) It's Godzilla, 2.) it received a good rating on IMDb. Whilst 1.) is non-negotiable, 2.) was an absolute farce.<br/><br/>I'd like to point out some every very bad areas of this movie.<br/><br/>The acting was horrid, I've seen better acting on TV Shows and Soap Operas, hell Jerry Springer hosts seemed more legit. Ice-Ts acting on CSI is even better The protagonist lacked any sense of emotion like he was a last decision on this set and forced into it by some cash incentive, most of the actors and actresses hardly showed any fear in a major mutant wrecking havoc in their city. Just look closely at the scenes where they're running away from the disaster and looking back and they just casually do so like someone's just yelled their name and told them they forgot their coffee on the sidewalk.<br/><br/>There was a scene where the Tsunami was approaching fast and a father had his girl on his shoulders fleeing, whilst facing the tsunami behind, she looks casually on while her father scurries. I've seen girls her age scream their lungs out when splashed with some waves on the beach! Godzilla looked like he was created from a human template complete with boxing arms and a narrow buff chest ready to box. As many people pointed out, neither we (the viewers) nor the actors really knew which side Godzilla was supposed to be on, it was all over the place.<br/><br/>I usually never comment on Sci-Fi movie facts as they're Sci-Fi, but common eating a Submarine and Missiles is very stupid...at least make it that they were hunting for raw uranium not a submarine hanging off a tree.<br/><br/>Last of my vent is the the audio engineers need to be sacked and forced to work at Dunkin Donuts for the rest of their lives. Godzilla sounded like a string of (damaged) Electric Guitar being prolonged with the occasional lion/elephant morph, whilst the stupid insects sounded like gunfire in the background with an old car-horn. Needless to say it was stupid as insects don't have vocal chords.<br/><br/>The first 20mins was the only decent run of this movie and the father was the only decent actor."
"wigglytoes","7","0","1","28 September 2014"," So very bad that it's good (as a comedy)
","Sure it's a really really bad movie. In the vain of just a bunch of action sequences strung together without much thought given to continuity or logic. But when the starting premise is that there exists a gigantic super powered monster that just popped into existence, then you have to give them some slack.<br/><br/>The truth is that I loved it. I think the trick was to walk into the viewing expecting absolutely crazy stuff. Anything goes. Kind of like a dream. Just random firing of brain synapses. Nothing made sense, but it was fun watching what was thrown on the screen next. It was so absurd, you have to laugh.<br/><br/>I don't think this gives away anything. But if you like to yell at the screen here's a line that I came up with half way through the movie. ""Look out Godzilla - they have machine guns"". Every time that you see someone with a machine gun - shout that. It'll have you rolling in the aisle."

","I wish I had read the reviews before I plunked down $20 for the purchase of this film. I was influenced by the trailer, and I did not think that this would be a terrible movie. I was wrong to think that, and I hope not to make that mistake again. It is true that most of the people who reviewed this movie note that there is no original storyline here, the monster Godzilla has approximately 20 minutes of screen time, near the end of the movie. I cannot recommend this movie as purchase or a rental. If you are going to wait for it until it is on cable or broadcast TV, that is OK, but even there I would warn you that you could spend your time better watching a better movie. <br/><br/>There are some major stars in this movie, all are wasted on a script that has nothing new to say or advance the legend of Godzilla, to put is simply this is a terrible script. Two of the major stars of the movie are killed off early on. Stars that I was hoping I would get to see throughout the movie. This movie was a major disappointment."

","I loved the 1998 version and was looking forward to this one. Boy was I disappointed. Very little of the actual monster and I found that many scenes were too dark to see or obstructed by smoke and dust to make out what was really happening. Definitely an anti-nuclear spin to it. I found that it was all over the map, literally and figuratively. I found it difficult to follow at times and it didn't help that visually it was hard to make out due to the darkness/little lighting. I am a fan of monster movies but this one left me feeling cheated. The acting was OK, and it was great seeing Bryan Cranston perform. The scenery in the south pacific was nice (during the daytime), but that's really all I can say in a positive light."

","I went into this expecting it to be Godzilla terrorizing a city until he is ultimately defeated. It was not what I expected, but that isn't a bad thing. However...<br/><br/>The Bad: The humans get way too much screen time for being largely inconsequential. Most of the characters are incredibly flat, which wouldn't be a problem if they were actually doing something. Flat characters + mindless action = entertainment. However, if they aren't doing a whole lot of action, it bogs the movie down.<br/><br/>The military is largely inept in this movie. They are pretty much a red herring. They make a lot of bad calls, and for some reason don't seem to understand the effect an EMP will have on aircraft. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the humans in this movie.<br/><br/>The star of the movie saw very little screen time.<br/><br/>The Good: The characters played by Brian Canston and Ken Watanabe were incredible, even if one died early and the other saw very little screen time.<br/><br/>The cinematography was excellent.<br/><br/>The final battle between Godzilla and the MUTOs was incredible. For a monster movie, it was realistic in how they moved (slow, lumbering movements) and you could really feel the weight of the creatures in how they acted.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie would have been better not with more action, but with less of the other stuff. It felt like a 90 minute movie stretched to 2 hours. Because I liked 75% of it, I'm giving it a 7/10."
"rayrodgpa","7","0","2","20 September 2014"," The king of the monsters has returned at the top of his game.
","2014's Godzilla is not directed by Roland Emmerich. That statement alone can swell up the heart of any Godzilla fan with utter joy. Gareth Edwards, director of the under-the-radar Sci-fi drama Monsters, takes a shot at reviving the radioactive monster; and revive him he did, in spectacular fashion. Before I ""Fan-boy"" all over this movie or something to that effect, let me begin with the things that were not so great. First thing coming to mind- the characters. With the exceptions of Godzilla and Bryan Cranston's character, who we don't see a lot on both accounts, no character in this movie is extremely interesting. Bryan Cranston, playing paranoid scientist and father to our lead Aaron Taylor Johnson, was great. He brought a powerful sense of desperation and emotion that let the audience invest in the story. Unfortunately, he doesn't stick around for long. Even more unfortunate, the film changes focus to young Ford Brody, Cranston's character's son and played by Kick-Ass himself Aaron Taylor Johnson. Ford Brody is an extremely bland and boring character, no real way to sugar-coat it. It's likely due to a screenplay more detailed about spectacle than characters, not necessarily due to poor acting by Johnson, but the character lacks any sort of...well, character. While that is a bad thing, it's still preferable to the over-acted and over- written characters in Godzilla '98. While the characters were this movie's biggest drawback, it more than makes up for it with amazing visuals and superb pacing. As contemporary audiences of cinema, we have become too accustomed to in-your-face, loud, blunt, and excessive violence brought on by the Michael Bay's, and the Roland Emmerich's, and the Man of Steel's. We are now used to that final amazing action scene taking place in act 1, 2, and 3. Gareth Edwards has made a film that alludes back to the glory days of cinema; movies like Jurassic Park, Jaws, Aliens. With a story structure that allows time to build suspense, to build tension. We have all already seen Pacific Rim (or according to it's disappointing box office, some of us have), we have all seen Transformers. We have all seen how amazing special effects can be, how far they have come. So how can you make your special effect extravaganza memorable? You tell it in a way that was lost somehow during this style over substance era of film. That's what Godzilla does. It doesn't have it's action scenes in the beginning. It teases and teases until the end, until the payoff, and boy does this movie payoff! The fighting scenes between the MUTO and Godzilla were awe-inspiring, both due to it's visual effects and it's realism. Edwards utilizes action to his advantage, using it as frosting on his big scaly, atomic-breathing cake. In the end, the film does have it's flaws, like any movie. The human characters are bland for the most part, there are a few dry spots here and there, and there are a few moments that were a little TOO convenient. But overall, Godzilla is a movie that is a long set up and pay-off. There is a moment near the end in which Godzilla utilizes his most iconic atomic breath, and I can guarantee you, if he were to have done that in the first act, it would not have had the same impact. If you walk in expected Man of Steel, you are in for a disappointment. If you walk in expecting something more than that, more than mindless action designed to distract people from a lack of an interesting story, then you are in for a treat."

","The movie is great, one of the rarely faithful productions to old classics. It is not a block buster action movie with monsters smashing every 30 seconds and sexy blond ladies running behind a mediocre guy. Movie builds up and is well forged upon old rubber monster Godzilla movies. There are bad people, good people, bad Godzilla, somewhat good Godzilla and evil monster for him to fight with. Is this movie about Godzilla, or is it more about what is important? There is no superhuman that saves the day and no body knows what to truly thing of Godzilla. Movie is solid in many ways, opening credits kept me with my eyes open which I miss for so many other movies, story development is not to deep but yet gives you this feeling that there is something going to happen, soon. Everybody knows Godzilla right? There is no need to go deep into genetics and make 2 hours story line how everybody is surprised about this monster, not even military is represented by typical bad guy in command. Movie develops and focuses on choices and does happen to be mostly wrong. If you are a Godzilla fan this is a good movie for you. If you like to flip thinking switch off and get flushed with Hollywood 2 hours long devastation movie then well you will be disappointed big time."
"iamelte","8","0","2","19 September 2014"," A competent version of Godzilla
","Well drawn out and detailed, this version of the iconic Godzilla is complimented by neat special effects,broad character development and a strong build up of suspense. While many may object to the brief screen time granted to the title character, the scenes that involve Godzilla and the Muto's are visually striking. The film makes the most of it's main character without overusing him which allows a steady flow of tension to build up between the characters and the overbearing powers of the monsters. In terms of plot development the details surrounding Godzilla's nature and significance is explored as well as size and stature which doesn't become fully expressed till a later part of the movie. The Film sells itself as both an action thriller and a monster movie, though both sometimes seem anachronistic when placed together. The action scenes operate very well in terms of developing a sense of dread and destruction, but this doesn't swallow up the film's other more subtle qualities"
"bora_mustafa","6","0","1","18 September 2014"," Do Not be fooled by the Epic Trailers – This is one big disappointment of a movie!!!,
","As an avid Godzilla Fan, I was so looking forward to this film and when I finally got to watch it in the cinema, I left the theatre very unhappy and angry. First of all, if you're expecting this to be anywhere near the original 1954 Godzilla movie where Godzilla causes chaos and destroys everything then you will be very disappointed. As mentioned the trailers made it look like Godzilla would be on a rampage but as it so happens Godzilla becomes the antihero and saves humanity by defeating two Mutos (Mutant Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) one that looks like a poor man's Mothra, the other larger Muto looks like one of those gigantic insects you saw back in Starship Troopers.<br/><br/>However the most disappointing issue is the fact that Godzilla is hardly in the movie itself, about 15 minutes max which is seriously false advertising. As soon as you get to see the big fella the film cuts back to the boring dialogue. The human characters aren't any better with Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe being the only decent actors but Cranston is only in the film for about 20 minutes and Watanabe is sadly wasted in his role of Dr Serizawa. The main lead Aaron Taylor-Johnson spends most of the movie with the same expression on his face and literally keeps travelling from San Francisco to Japan taking the entire army with him. In fact the film almost seems more like a disaster movie than a monster movie.<br/><br/>Having said all the negatives, I really liked the new design of Godzilla and his nuclear atomic breath looked awesome and this is the most faithful version of the king of monsters when comparing to the classic Toho Godzilla. I also enjoyed the battle between Godzilla and the Mutos and it's obvious with the way the film ended that a possible sequel could be in the works. But please Mr Gareth Edwards if you intend to make a sequel let's see more of the big fella this time round and less of the human characters.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy compared to the 1998 catastrophe, but not perfect by any stretch."
"iconic-sr","5","0","2","17 September 2014"," Hollywood: Hopes to Resurrect Godzilla
","Initial Review: Godzilla has seen the big screen numerous times (mostly in countries outside of America), but has only had two major Hollywood depictions. The 1998 Godzilla was considered by many not only a poor film, but also a poor depiction of the legendary monster. Godzilla would lay dormant until 16 years later when another Godzilla film (no relation to the first in 1998) would be released in 2014. In many ways, 2014 Godzilla brings back the monster from the old Japanese films that made him/her (whatever it is) so popular, but there are some flaws to its monstrous interpretation.<br/><br/>The Positives: One issue I had with the original film is the opposition Godzilla had to face (which was really none at all, it was more Godzilla tearing up the city). In the 2014 version, Godzilla faces off against two monsters of god-like size and power. I must say it was fun watching the ending battle scene. The movie has a decent story line that works for this movie, even better than the '98 version. I am also going to list Godzilla's appearance as a positive, but it's mostly a matter of opinion. Godzilla's look has returned to the original appearance Japanese Godzilla films.<br/><br/>The Negatives: 2014 Godzilla is flawed for mainly one factor (and a major one at that). In my opinion, the film fails to keep active attention from the audience viewing it until the end of the movie. The first 3/4 of the movie is a total bore and really is not worth watching except for the necessary background for the end. Godzilla gets a total of maybe 25 minutes of screen time, and the rest of the movie teases you with glimpse sightings. The movie is also filled with boring chatter that interests just about no one except the people in the movie.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: In many ways, 2014 Godzilla is the superior Hollywood movie. However, this doesn't make for a good film in general. The only part worth watching is the last 40 minutes of the movie, in which you will have to wait a while to see. I cannot recommend this movie to general audiences, but for fans of the larger than life monster, this may be a good movie to watch."

","After a decade, Godzilla has returned to the big screen. This time, the mutant dinosaur fights 2 monstrous creatures who threaten the world. EOD Ford Brody must get back to his family during this chaos.<br/><br/>I was psyched to hear that a Godzilla reboot was in the works. After seeing a couple trailers and commercials, I got even more excited. However I didn't set my expectations too high; I was thinking it was going to be good, not awesome, fantastic, etc. My uncle and I went and saw it on the first day it came out. Basically, this movie takes the 98' remake and crushes it.<br/><br/>The special effects were, in a way, incredible. I love the new Godzilla design, the M.U.T.O design was quite ominous looking and of course the destruction was cool. The acting was overall pretty good. For a movie like this, the characters were actually pretty nice. I've only seen Bryan Cranston and Ken Wantanbe in one or two other movies/shows, but they both did awesome performances. It was nice that they brought back the name Serizawa (doctor of the same name from the original film). Yes, they could've had Joe (Cranston) live a little while longer, but he did his job.<br/><br/>While the monster fight scenes were good, the way they were shown was interesting. Either the monsters took up the whole screen, you saw them in the background while the characters were doing something, or you might see them on a TV. While they could've done more of the monster action taking up the whole frame, this way was kind of unique. And yes, they probably could've done a little more monster screen time, but you can't have everything.<br/><br/>The concept of the nuclear testing in the Pacific being a cover-up to try and kill Godzilla was a genius idea (I thought so anyway). I was kind of disappointed that we didn't see Admiral Stenz's ""HALO Jump"" speech that was shown in the trailers. I liked how this Godzilla was the anti-hero, not the hero nor the villain. Director Gareth Edwards described him as ""a force of nature, he's the punishment we deserve."" If you ask me, that's pretty deep stuff.<br/><br/>There you have it, ""Godzilla"" is (I think) a great, satisfying film. I was quite impressed with how they handled this movie and I place it behind ""Captain America the Winter Soldier"" as one of the best movies of the year. The 1998 remake has officially been blown out of the water and I give it a B+. I hope the sequel will be just as good if not better."
"drawlife","6","0","2","4 September 2014"," He's back, and it's pretty good, but it could have been better.
","What this film tries to do, is combining both a human element and Godzilla action all together. <br/><br/>There are some, actually rather a lot of slow moments here and there, but I commend director Gareth Edwards for trying to be something more, and at least trying to bring human elements into the film. This easily could have been a just a monster movie you go for just violence and action, but I give credit to Gareth Edwards for still maintaining that element, but trying to put together a coherent story. <br/><br/>Aaron Johnson is good at portraying Ford Brody, a military man who deeply cares for his child and wife Elle Brody played by Elizabeth Olsen and his father Joe Brody played by Bryan Cranston, but understands his duty as a soldier. Again, there are slow moments, but it kept me intrigued for the most part, despite Johnson playing it straight-forward. I felt that the character development of this film is as good as it gets when it comes to disaster, giant monster films, with the exception of Bryan Cranston who in particular stole mostly every scene he was in despite him getting killed off so quickly. However, a major character I was disappointed in was Ken Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa, who only serves in the film as exposition and explanation for the story to progress.<br/><br/>Now I loved every monster moments. I loved every single Godzilla shots and every single fight. Now our favorite green giant lizard does appear sporadically, which can cause some irritation. I get what Edwards was trying to do, build up anticipation and excitement, but it's over done and can get annoying, but the last 20 minutes is what makes everything worthwhile. This is where the whole film pays out and worth the price of admission, Godzilla is unleashed in his full potential and glory. I could have used just a bit more Godzilla here and there, but again I applaud Gareth Edwards holding off showing Godzilla to develop tension and anticipation, I just wish he didn't do it almost three or four times in a row. <br/><br/>As for Godzilla, well he looks great, sure he's a tad bit fat, but he looks so much better than a man in a rubber suit. <br/><br/>Very fun in the last 20-30 minutes or so. <br/><br/>6.2/10"

","""Nature has an order. A power to restore balance. I believe he is that power.""<br/><br/>Now this was a movie I was looking forward for so long already.This should have been a mega-movie that would beat the 1998 version in every way with one's hand tied behind one's back.The 1998 ""Godzilla"" was for me a bit of a setback with a cardboard monster, terrible humorless acting and a ""Jurassic Park"" type of ending.With current technology,it should be possible to create a grandiose visual spectacle.But what a terrible disappointment it was eventually.<br/><br/>The first thing that flashed through my mind was that they could just as well have used the title. ""A tiny bit of Godzilla"".You'll see the monster of monsters approximately 15 minutes.I have read here and there some arguments from Godzilla-hardcore enthusiasts that the movie remained faithful to the original Godzilla films and that the absence of the monster contributes to the build-up of tension.I hope they won't generalize this technique in future films.Imagine the new ""Tarzan"" movie where you stare for half an hour at the adventures of Cheetah and finally Tarzan shows up the last 10 minutes to save the day. Or imagine ""Jaws"" made like this! After one and a half hour looking at a fin cutting through the seawater, the shark finally appears at the end and gets blown into smithereens.Exciting? Not exactly.It's more a ""Santa-Clause"" excitement that children experience.For them it's also just waiting until that imaginary figure finally reappears in their country.<br/><br/>I admit,""Godzilla"" is a film icon with a very rich history that I know little about.I didn't know that this was already the 30th official movie.Godzilla has been around since 1954.A creature from the ocean that got such monstrous dimensions because of radioactive radiations. It was a resounding success and the ""Showa"",""Heisei"" and ""Millenium"" series were produced between 1954 and 2004 by Toho.The two American versions were both made under the watchful eye of Toho making sure that the rules of a Godzilla film were properly applied:part of the film must take place in Japan,Godzilla never kills people and it won't die.<br/><br/>However,""Godzilla"" better had followed a diet before showing itself. It looks ponderous and fat.Admittedly,it's a lot better than the version in which a person plays it in a latex suit.But apparently the iconic monster really feasted on fat whales since his last appearance. Perhaps that's the reason of his meager 15 minutes appearance.The burden of obesity,perhaps.That is the first frustration.The short screenplay that Godzilla gets. And that for the star player the movie is named after.And the moment it comes in the picture,it doesn't get the full attention and has to share the spotlight with two other prehistoric giants.And there is annoyance number two.Those two look terribly bad.Almost like two metal monstrosities.But the sound they produce is seriously frightening and imaginative.This could be a personal touch by Gareth Edwards who gave in ""Monsters"" (as far as I can remember) the aliens also such a unique sound. <br/><br/>But my biggest frustration was that the entire film was covered in complete darkness and shades.I suppose the prehistoric monsters aren't fond of sunshine (probably they are afraid to get extinct again) and therefore act when the sun goes down,and preferably when the rain is pouring down from the sky (The 1998 film had the same phenomenon).The entire film is shrouded in fog, dust and smoke. It's sometimes really hard to distinguish something.The only bright moments were during human interactions. And that part of the movie was the most positive. The human aspect was of an acceptable level and proves the emphasis is on this and not on the creatures fighting each other.<br/><br/>Both Bryan Cranston(Joe Brody) as Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Ford Brody)did some brilliant acting.Joe is the desperate engineer who lost his wife in the past during a disaster at the nuclear power plant in Janjira.After enigmatic seismic activity the plant collapsed completely.15 Years later Joe is still looking for the cause of this catastrophe.His son Ford, however, has put this behind him,lives in San Francisco and is an explosive expert in the U.S.army.His relationship with his father is at a low ebb.The father-son story with the known mutual blaming,is not really soggy and over-dramatized,but shown in a convincing way.Also Ken Watanabe(Dr. Serizawa Ishiro) was the right man for the role of expert in the field of these prehistoric monsters.David Strathairn had to do the ungrateful part of the commanding Admiral.There's always such a character in these kinds of movies:a pedantic military who always does what he thinks is best, regardless of the recommendations of the experts,until things really go wrong and then crawls back with his tail between his legs,begging for help.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad.The action part was sufficiently present.And the special effects looked really splendid at times (if they were visible through the smoke and clouds).The main thing missing was the tension"" (not the ""Santa-Claus"" tension).And what was too much present in here? Nonsensical actions and decisions.Why didn't Joe empty his automatic rifle on the soft part of the MUTO?I would have done it. Twice there was an unlikely reunion amidst an immense crowd.And the fragment of the enormous bunker where nuclear waste was stored,was completely ridiculous!Of course nobody saw the huge crater behind the metal door ...<br/><br/>For moviegoers who expect a movie with a gang of monsters bashing each other brains,with clear images and nerve-racking tension,it'll be a real setback.The Godzilla fans,who applause the ""delayed appearing"" and interpret it as tension,will surely enjoy it.I'm a little bit in between and still very disappointed.This new version is not what I expected,namely better than the 1998 version.Ultimately, it is just the same.Fortunately,Godzilla is not that vengeful after all those nuclear bombs that they used against him in the past.He left San Francisco as a bull in a china shop and was kind enough not to damage Frisco more.Respect!<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"

","7.5/ for Entertainment / Monsterousity 2/10 for story / substance<br/><br/>First, let me start by saying I really liked it. It was cool, entertaining and, for the most part, very involved. I hadn't read the plot, only watched that popular teaser trailer, so the MUTO's were a big surprise for me - and that was pretty cool - if very reminiscent of the Cloverfield monster. (MUTO's being other Kaiju monsters)<br/><br/>In fact, I think Cloverfield, Pacific Rim and 2014's Godzilla, really come together as a whole and compliment each other. Perhaps in the same Kaiju universe but at different points in time - taking us from Cloverfield's first public outing of the Kaiju, through the current period of Godzilla and on to the future battlefield featured in Pacific Rim<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes - everyone did a convincing job. Bryan Cranston's acting was superb and his character development was great - but then it stopped. There was no character development or any other solid characters really at all. The Japanese scientist was in the film throughout but he had a total of about 3 lines, all delivered after he spent 10 minutes watching whatever TV show was on the back of his own retina's.<br/><br/>Cranston's son was the big protagonist in the film and yet we could have been watching anyone, he just happened to be the guy the camera followed. There was no character development at all there, we knew he had a son and with and worked with the Navy as a bomb disposal guy - that is, quite literally, the extent of his character development, unless someone noticed he had a specific College tshirt on during his 2 minute return home after 14 months in the Middle East before heading off around the world again - I know I didn't.<br/><br/>The story - pretty flimsy, again, we just kind of watched things as they happen, it didn't really seem to go anywhere. The was a basic premise; weird activity, monsters emerge, then Godzilla appears to eat them. He does the classic monster movie look into the eyes of ""the good guy"" instead of eating him, and then leaves.<br/><br/>The spin on the concept (assuming it wasn't covered back in the 1950's) was good. The Kaiju ruled the earth before the dinosaurs, feeding on the radioactivity of the new planet (Earth) before being forced underground and into extinction.<br/><br/>The CGI during the first half of the film was pretty weak, I wouldn't be surprised if the first and second acts had different CG Companies running them. Towards the start the CGI was very hazy, the luminance of the CGI didn't seem to match the real effects, almost as if they had the exposure slightly off while rendering it. In the second half. everything looked pretty sweet, Godzilla was considerably more detailed than the other Kaiju.<br/><br/>Godzilla himself was exactly like the originals, but he came across like a cuddly toy with a face like my cat when she looks like a little bear. But I guess when you're modelling your monster on a guy in a fluffy suit, that's to be expected. I was torn here, because I hate remakes, they ruin everything and show a complete lack of originality, but then the Godzilla design was faithful to the originals - which was the right choice but nearly didn't work because he was too toy like. That said, by the end I really did like him. The Japanese complained that he was overweight, the Americans, obsessed with weight and political correctness, brought about a tirade of ""it's OK to be fat"". But when you watch it, it's something you do notice, he is very over weight.<br/><br/>Oh and the monster attacks - fantastic. If I read that on paper, I would have whinged my head off, but that was really really good and echo'd the Kaiju from (the badly acted) Pacific Rim, with the EMP's and the plasma breath. It really added a great dimension to the film, the creatures and the genre itself. I don't follow comics etc, but I'm believe the Godzilla of the 1950's breathed fire etc. It sounds cheesy, monsters firing off EMP's and blue plasma breath, but the execution was spot on.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film. The monsters stole the show - perhaps the goal of the director, but, unfortunately at the expense of neglecting the human characters.<br/><br/>Worth a cinema ticket, probably wouldn't buy it."
"ryanhayes224","7","0","2","28 July 2014"," Is it really about Godzilla?
","So I watched the movie this evening and I got to say that I am amazed. This movie looks and feels like an old Godzilla movie, classic design,classic roar and I appreciate it. But the movie fall just short for one reason.<br/><br/>The Characters: Godzilla movies are suppose to be about well Godzilla right? But in this movie we are introduced and tagged along with Ford and guy who does bomb stuff in the military for a living. The problem here is as the movie goes on it seems like the movie is just about him and his struggle to get back to his wife and son, and we forget what this movie is about sometimes. Let me remind everyone that the movie should be about Godzilla kicking monster ass, but instead we have character development about some family who experienced Godzilla. Don't get me wrong this is good but not when.the whole movie is about this. What this movie really needs to be is Godzilla's development as a character overcoming the challenge of defeating the monster and saving the human race (because as we know Godzilla has ambition to save the human race) with a small perspective of what people experienced not a whole plot. If Godzilla's fight and conflict was the center-point it would make a better movie. Well in my opinion."

","This movie is a lot better than I expected. The cinematography is absolutely amazing, probably the best I've ever seen. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and the rest of the cast did a great job at acting. The special effects and CGI were very realistic. The score didn't flow very well with the movie, but it was still great.<br/><br/>A lot of people complained that this movie has a horrible plot. They are right, to some extent. The story isn't very advanced, but you can expect that from a movie that was made for the action. This brings me to another point. Many people were also disappointed that Godzilla didn't get much screen time, which is also true. I too am disappointed by that fact. I feel like he didn't get much screen time so that the plot could progress, but the plot didn't progress very well. That is why I am rating this movie 8, instead of 9 or 10.<br/><br/>Overall, Godzilla was an entertaining movie that had great camera work, special, effects, etc. I will definitely see it again. I don't know why it is rated 7.1. Maybe hardcore Godzilla fans were expecting a better movie? Whatever it may be, I think that this movie should be rated at least 7.5. I obviously can't change that, so I can least make my opinion known.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!<br/><br/>~Micah Knowles"

","I feel like (spoilers) the movie would have been a heck of a lot more fun if Bryan Cranston had stared in the entire movie. But NOPE! Instead we get Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays the most bland character out of every character in this movie (I felt more emotions from the MONSTERS instead of him!) Speaking of the monsters, they were SO COOL! Even if the part with Godzilla breathing fire was ridiculously convenient, let's face it, that scene was AWESOME! That's what the film has going for it. What it doesn't have going for it is that although I haven't seen too many monster movies in my life, the film does have a ""been there, done that"" sort of feel to it. What I mean by that is that the film had a lot of scenes involving kids in peril (who were HORRIBLE actors by the way) and involved the monsters attacking EVERY SINGLE MAJOR CITY! It was pretty much what Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs was parodying. But overall, I liked this movie. The director knew what he wanted to do and achieved it, but at the same time didn't go above and beyond what was expected. Good job remaking Godzilla though!"

","I came to watch this movie with a quite high expectation based on the trailer that I saw before and expect it to be an apocalyptic movie with an intense plot on the human side. The damn trailer also gives an impression that godzilla is gonna kill the human race and some how we must fight it back.<br/><br/>And the worst part about the movie came when the main character's father (Bryan Cranston) dies. I was like WTF?? If that guy is still alive he can probably carry and improves the plot and make it more sophisticated. But what i got is a dumb-retarded-lame plot acted by an uninspired-expressionless actor and actress. I can bet that Sylvester Stallone or Arnold can make better expression than this bunch of retards(except Bryan Cranston).<br/><br/>And it include Ken Watanabe as well, who to me just a lame excuse to relate this movie to Japan or Japanese people. He and Bryan Cranston can be a good duo in this movie, but instead this dumbass director and the scriptwriter decide that Bryan Cranston character must die and Ken Watanabe keep spouting stupid and lame dialogue written by an idiotic scriptwriter! What a bunch of stupid-fukin assholes! <br/><br/>The only saving grace for this movie is the Godzilla himself and the CGI & audio team, other than that its full of BS. But i must comment on the Godzilla movement that resemble a gorilla which is a mammal(maybe godzilla is raised by a group of gorilla i don't know) rather than a reptile (ie:lizard, comodo dragon etc). Other than that, Godzilla is totally bad-ass and the moment where he fires the plasma from his mouth is the awesomest moment in the movie ever!<br/><br/>p/s: an exciting movie to watch only if you can ignore the horrible acting and the idiotically retardedly lame plot development"

"laurenbrigittepool","7","0","1","7 July 2014"," Unfortunately not enough for a ten
","I enjoyed this movie, but the first part spent too much time worrying about who killed a man's wife or how safe a woman's husband was. Watching the trailer, I had high expectations. Godzilla looked awesome, and I was really looking forward for a Godzilla battle when I was going to see it. The trailer was also a big liar. It hid about 90% of the movie, including the two extra dinosaurs and making it seem that it was actually about Godzilla. Unfortunately, most of this movie wasn't even about Godzilla, which I was why I don't think it deserves a high rating as it is already rated. Wasn't this movie called Godzilla? Yes, but how long was Godzilla seen in this movie? About 5% of it. You see the other random dinosaurs in it more than the main purpose of the movie. Instead of having more stories with the human association, how about making Godzilla the main point of the movie, making him the big evil enemy to people and make him the only problem. I didn't buy a ticket to see a movie called ""Godzilla"" to see a man's wife get killed and then seeing that most of the movie is just about that. Besides all the negatives, this movie was okay. The action was the only bearable part. The part I was looking forward to. It was the part that saved the movie and it might also be the reason I want to purchase this on DVD when released. It is expected that there will be a second one, which I am looking forward to that and also expecting some improvements, with more action and exciting scenes."
"lukemcn1995","7","0","3","2 July 2014"," Godzilla - he's back, but I wish we saw more of him!!
","so, for any die hard Godzilla fan who starts off by saying that all Godzilla movies only have a limited space of time where Godzilla is on screen - I completely agree. I have seen around 20 Godzilla movies, and I have to say, on the whole, I LIKED this movie. <br/><br/>Bryan Cranston is awesome in this movie, his dominance of the first act of the film makes the human drama very compelling and emotional, and I really buy into it and am entertained by it. I completely disagree with the move to kill him off as he was a great character, and could have carried this movie on his own. Having seen it for a second time, I'm not as critical of the other actors as I originally was, and I appreciate that whilst they have done much better work, the guys were up to scratch, and I feel maybe that the slightly one dimensional element to the characters is almost like a homage to the older Godzilla movies, which is what i felt like this movie essentially was. The movie does well to capture all the elements of Godzilla's character - the antagonist, the anti-hero, and the protagonist - where he goes through all these stages in that order, and the final scene where he lets off that roar, with the eyes of the world on him, being labelled the king of the monsters, is very satisfying. He looks completely amazing, the effects on Godzilla are second to none, and it is almost like he is actually there. The soundtrack for the movie is great and executed very well, to fit the movies tone, and I was quite happy with the suspenseful build up to the 3rd act, if the the 2nd act involving the destruction of the cities wasn't almost entirely OFF SCREEN I would have been even happier. <br/><br/>I WANTED TO SEE MORE OF GODZILLA. YES, THE ORIGINAL HAS HIM IN IT FOR 20 MINUTES OR SO, BUT THAT MOVIE WAS ALSO 96 MINUTES LONG, THIS MOVIE WAS 123. Godzilla has about the same screen time as he did in the original, and it simply is not enough for you to feel 100% satisfied with the film, I would have been much happier to see him fighting the MUTO's leading up to the grand finale, and I don't think it would have taken away from the final battle at all. Furthermore, the MUTO's are not very original, and their sole purpose in the movie are to be Godzilla's sparring partners, and nothing more. Their design is very boring, and although I appreciate Legendary did not have the rights to any other Toho monsters, I feel as though they could have come up with something better than what they did, the kaiju of pacific rim were even better than this pair of parasites. <br/><br/>In this movie there are 2 instances where they give you Mothra easter eggs, so I would be really happy if for the sequels they manage to get Mothra in there, that would be awesome. I also feel like there is no need in the sequel to hide Godzilla from us for so long, so perhaps Edwards will steer away from that move. There's so many angles they could take the sequel in, so I'm very excited to see what they do. I'd be happy to see Ken Watanabe return, but with better lines, and I am not fussed either way if Aaron Taylor-Johnson appears, but if he does, make him more interesting. The overall representation of Godzilla is definitely this movies highlight, he starts off as this ''god'' of pure destruction, only to become the de-facto answer to the problem of the MUTO's, and to be hailed as a Saviour in the closing minutes - a great evolution that tributes well to the original series in one movie, whilst making him look stunning and more realistic at the same time. <br/><br/>Overall, the great things about this movie are Cranston, Godzilla's look, feel, as well as action, the soundtrack, and the apocalyptic tone, and the potential for a really awesome sequel. It's downfall are its continuous teasing, killing Cranston off, and the design of the MUTO's."
"LeDentalPlaque","6","0","2","28 June 2014"," Not Living Up To Monstrous Expectations
","Godzilla may very well be the most anticipated of the film, because, hey...who doesn't like remakes of the famous monster? We've been watching Godzilla for decades!<br/><br/>Before going to see the movie, I watched several trailers and I was excited that the creators of this version were taking a new approach to the film. The trailers didn't show much, but it showed a good cast with Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe. So, I had my hopes up for an awesome movie with tons of fighting and CGI.<br/><br/>The day before I went to see Godzilla, I saw on IMDb that the rating for Godzilla was 9.3/10, making me think ""Wow, this movie must have been over-the-top amazing!"", so I bought my tickets to go see it right away. But...as the movie progressed, I got increasingly disappointed with the entire movie.<br/><br/>**SPOILER ALERT**<br/><br/>It was to my great surprise that Bryan Cranston did not play a huge role in the film! He appeared a little bit, and then was gone. Ken Watanabe fell into the same boat, with him just being silent and staring off into space most of the time. <br/><br/>But most annoying was Godzilla himself and these weird bug-like creatures. There was minimal fighting throughout the movie (just some in the end), but most of the movie focused on waiting for the monsters to fight and humans not being able to do anything about it. In other words, the movie pretty much waited for Godzilla to act as our saviour.<br/><br/>Overall, although I still enjoyed the film because it's Godzilla, I was highly disappointed with this remake. More effort should have been put in to make the storyline better and to incorporate more action-packed and epic moments in the film, because if you're going to watch Godzilla, you really don't want to spend money watching drama and suspense. You want Godzilla to be the star! Not remain hidden for most of the movie."

This is the ""highbrow"" version, with A-list actors (What is Juliette Binoche doing here?) a hunky hero, adorable children in peril, and of course, great CGI, which these days is a substitute for an original script. Who needs a new idea when you've got so many cool special effects? The ""new"" idea here is that Godzilla turns out to be – sort of like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Two. Get it? But the twist is actually pretty mundane, and there are few surprises otherwise. It's always fun to see Bryan Cranston scurrying around like a lunatic, though once he's out of the picture this movie is just waiting around for the inevitable end.

This and the timer lose all validity. It was started in the day time for 1 1/2 hours. and at night still had time left, I do not think that the producers watch is a Timex, because he has no clue of time.

","I personally thought Godzilla didn't go too well with the source material, nor was the main monster Godzilla. I feel that the main monster was really whatever the hell those two things were in the movie. They get the most attention, and Godzilla is mostly being used to kill them. Sure, the monster gets a lot of attention, but he is just a side-character, while most of the attention is on the other monsters. They are the main threat, and Godzilla helps the people of San Francisco. There's another thing as well. Godzilla is turned good in this movie, which is not what he is about. Godzilla is a monster that shoots a blue laser beam, and terrorizes cities. He doesn't just help people by killing monsters. Okay, maybe he did that a few dozen times, but he's not just about helping people. He destroys cities like Tokyo, Japan and not San Francisco. One more problem I had was the ending. This movie had a chance to go on an hour and a half more to get a good resolution, whereas in this movie, it had a very short resolution with the credits coming in to disappoint the audience. That's my nitpicking review."

","Godzilla 2014 is a vast improvement over the quite terrible 1998 film. The film started well and I enjoyed the mix of Science and Geography thrown in there especially about the nuclear reactor. It kept the film motivating and purposeful. Sadly this all faded leaving Godzilla and two other large creatures roaming around the world destroying various things. From here on end the film had a very poor plot (Kill Godzilla) and the acting was only mediocre. The US army were both good and at the same time pathetic. Trying to shoot the beast quite obviously didn't help at all. So what did they try doing... Blow up Godzilla! This just reminded me how lame the creativity of this film really was. In saying this the effects were brilliant and watching the film in 3D IMAX made things even better. The sound effects and music is to be commended too.

"svanlijnden","7","0","2","15 June 2014"," Godzilla Rocks It, Shame about the Humans
","Does Godzilla need a motivation? Don't we just want to see him mindlessly wreck cities, preferably while fighting other monsters? In this new movie, if I understood things correctly, he is trying to 'restore balance' according to a scientist. Get this – Godzilla goes New Age! In any case, during the high points, the movie simply shows him doing what he does best. I haven't seen any of the original Japanese Godzilla (Gojira) movies in full, just the not very memorable US version from 1998. But it seems like large parts of the 2014 version are respectful of the source material. Only instead of a guy in a suit, we get grade A special effects simulating massive property damage and countless deaths. I liked the nods to Japan, acknowledging Gojira's roots, even if the movie cant resist dragging the climax over to US shores.<br/><br/>Some viewers have complained that you don't get to clearly see Godzilla enough, but I don't know what they are talking about. It takes the movie quite a while to work up to showing him in full, but once the movie gets to it, you can take good, long looks at him. But then, some people have also complained that Godzilla looks too fat here. Seriously? We're fat- shaming Godzilla now? So sometimes opinions are suspect.<br/><br/>The people in this movie are pretty ineffectual when you look back on it. The biggest direct, positive impact they have on how events play out, is just a lucky happenstance of something that was – admittedly – a smart longterm play by one person. I can't be more specific without getting too spoilery, alas. But the human part of the cast is mostly around to observe, offer explanations about motive and to either get killed or narrowly escape. The main guy is one of those magic everymans who is both just-a-dude and someone who constantly happens to find himself in the thick of things. The family drama part of the movie is fairly by-the-numbers and the script doesn't actually follow through on its 'you must do everything to save your family' (paraphrased) plot- thread. By the way, no matter what the trailers promised you, the lead is not the oft-worshipped Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame. Instead, we get the fine-but-no-Bryan-Cranston Aaron Taylor-Johnson.<br/><br/>I was glad to see that the movie didn't feel the need for an after- credits tease or one of those annoying last scenes that open the door wide for a sequel. Instead, we get a surprise ending in that the final shot doesn't seem like it will be the final shot, but then the credits start to roll. Ah well, goodbye for now Godzilla, when it's sequel time, I doubt you will have trouble busting through the door.<br/><br/>More reviews at: PopCultJunk.com / Twitter: @PopCultJunk"
"allies_vs_axis","7","0","2","12 June 2014"," Decent monster action flick as long as you know what to expect
","I should start by saying that I have not seen many of the original Godzilla films, but I have seen some. That being said, this movie definitely seems to aspire to the feel of the originals: Godzilla goes into town and fights monster of the day, causing property damage and untold number of casualties before swimming off into the sunset. If that is what you expect, that is what you'll get. The ""villain"" monsters cause plenty enough destruction on their own, too. Like Battle: L.A. this movie will give you plenty of action and flash the U.S. military's muscle, but doesn't spend a whole lot of time on developing 3 dimensional characters and their motivations. This is in part due to the focus on the monsters, but the two dimensional characters get a lot more screen time than the Kaiju doing battle.<br/><br/>The big name actors advertised, as said before, seem downplayed in comparison. Bryan Cranston (in his short screen time) seems to again fit into the role of a brilliant scientist caught up in an obsession that destroys his personal life and relationship with his family. It was hard not to see him as Walter White, but that's a role that's going to stick with him for a long time. Ken Wantanabe was quiet for much of the film, internalizing much that might have been beneficial for us to hear, such as how he started to revere the creature known as ""Gojira"". Being a recent returning veteran I can identify somewhat with the protagonist, but I concede that his character wasn't much beyond that ""hat"". <br/><br/>The main complaint I have with the film is its tone. The movie was very serious for a throwback to campy giant monster movies. There wasn't a remotely funny or ""light"" scene to balance the drama and destruction until the end of the final showdown. Additionally, the imagery of certain scenes borrowed from several real life disasters. The attack at the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant was evocative of the Japanese quake and Fukushima disaster (with a touch of Chernobyl for the aftermath years later). The attack on Hawaii borrows a very specific tale from the Indonesia tsunami, namely when a young girl noticed receding water and knew it meant a tsunami would follow, giving the people around her enough time to flee to high ground. Lastly, the aftermath of the final fight. You can't tell me the firefighters tearing through the grey rubble wasn't inspired by the rescue efforts after 9/11. <br/><br/>Lastly, I have some minor technical and plot complaints. For many of the questions I had, the movie made an effort to answer them in some way. The excuse plot devices may have been weak, but at least they addressed it. What I didn't care for was some of the science behind the radiation. For one, radioactivity isn't some juice canned up in missiles and reactors that can be ""sucked out"". The monsters would either have to feed on the solid metal plutonium, or ingest the rays emitted by the fuel source, simultaneously bathing any humans near by in lethal doses (people took off their protective equipment far too frequently in the movie without checking local readings). The one time we see a dosimeter in the Japanese exclusion zone, it reads zero. Radiation is never zero. It may be minuscule and perfectly safe, but never absent, although I understand they probably did it for simplicity's sake since the average moviegoer probably doesn't understand that bananas, granite counter-tops, and being a frequent flier increase your annual radiation dosage. Regarding the creatures' affinity for radiation, radiotrophs are a real thing, as discovered in fungi growing in the Chernobyl reactor room. The question is then what role do Godzilla and the Mutos' predatory functions play in their evolutionary path? Godzilla is never seen eating the MUTOs, just fighting them. Does the radiation sustain him, their meat, or both? What do the MUTOs eat? At one point they are called parasites, but we never see them doing anything parasitic other than eating our radiation. A final minor issue: Yucca Mountain is West of Las Vegas. Why would the female break out of Yucca, swing East to cause havoc, then turn back west to reunite with her mate? <br/><br/>Despite these flaws, a decent film as long as all you're going in to see is Godzilla and friends wrecking stuff while mankind feebly tries to intervene. I enjoyed it, and if you don't know much about nuclear physics or have a decent suspension of disbelief, this movie can entertain you. Just don't expect huge plot twists, deep characters, or Walter White using science to kill giant monsters."
"yoodadude","7","0","1","12 June 2014"," (I don't wanna write a summary)
","Godzilla review *SPOILERS* I guess, but the plot is obvious already.<br/><br/>Godzilla was an ""okay"" movie. Not that great, but not that bad. 7.1/10<br/><br/>There were a lot of things that I liked about it. I like the look, definitely. He looks like something that would actually exist and I like how they stick close to the original Gojira. The movie special effects and the action were also flawless. When you watch it, sit at the bottom part of the theater. You won't feel how ""massive"" he is when you sit far from the screen (also, this might not be as enjoyable if you watched it on your phone). Also Heisenberg is always fun to watch. He delivers REAAALLY well.<br/><br/>The thing with the movie is, the trailers and the build-up for the movie are all misleading. The trailers make you think that Heisenberg was warning us all about Gojira; that the whole movie is about how the humans try to fight him off and get him back to the ocean, but it's not. Heisenberg was warning us about the other monsters, the Muto (I just don't get why they didn't just get Mothra... or Gamera... or that 3 headed dragon Ghidora). Heisenberg doesn't even have a clue about Gojira's existence. All his really creepy warnings in the trailer are not about him. Also Heisenberg dies?? He was in all the trailers and doing most of the narration, and he gets killed before the first quarter of the movie? Walter White deserves more screen time (at least more than Kick-ass. He was boring as hell).<br/><br/>Also, the fight scenes! There was barely any more than one major fight! It was awesome, but it only happens in the end. Gojira and the Yuto(Muto? whatever) clash several times throughout the movie, but the moment the fight begins, we cut straight to the humans! I don't wanna watch Kick-ass and fake Ra's Al Ghul be all sad about the sh*t that's happening. I wanna watch Gojira kick monster ass... repeatedly! I know the director did it all for the build-up, but people already KNOW what to expect. We have Power Rangers to thank for that (and standards set by Pacific Rim). No use building up something that isn't even a mystery.<br/><br/>I also get how they wanted everything to be scientifically accurate/believable, but Gojira appears just for the sole purpose to ""put nature into balance""? Trouble appears and Gojira comes out, beats the sh*t out of it, then leaves? That's far too mythical to be put in a movie that wants to be as ""accurate"" as possible. I do like how he's a good guy here. I just wanted it to make sense. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie was alright. Just add the action of Pacific Rim with the story of this movie and the film might've turned out better. Let's hope X-men doesn't disappoint."

","Bryan Cranston, Juliette Binoche, Ken Watanabe--> great veteran actors.

Unfortunately, Aaron has one face throughout most of the movie. Maybe it was the writing, maybe it was the directing, but the emotions and character development aren't there.

The story is then puked on by a lame nurse (maggie gyllenhaal) who is in love with a lame military dude (Kicka**). The story between the lame nurse and the lame military dude is very typical and is boring as crap, it's as if Micheal Bay and Bruckheimer wrote part of it.<br/><br/>Before I watched it I read the reviews that said there is not enough of Godzilla, I disagree. Godzilla could of had more screen time sure but the amount he was in it doesn't hurt the movie.<br/><br/>What did need to be in the movie more is Brain Cranston and Ken Watwawbabwaawbwbab?. Those two could've made this movie so much better if their parts were bigger.<br/><br/>The most disappointing part of the movie is to my own fault(kind of). I imagined this movie was going to be really morbid really terrifying more thought provoking more realistic. Radiation, nuclear Bombs, entire cities being destroyed. I wanted to see the real destruction and horror of what Godzilla can cause. The beginning had me believe I wasn't going to be let down, but then it turned into a typical blockbuster pg-13 movie that shows no blood or death and has a happy ending.<br/><br/>I give this movie a low rating because I wanted a lot more out of it. I've been excited about this movie since day one and it let me down. It's a generic movie for a generic audience."
"bobbysing","4","0","3","2 June 2014"," Despite having three instead of one, it still fails to deliver the thrills.
","Having loved its 1998 version with few sequences resembling the JURRASIC PARK series, I was pretty much excited to see this new upgraded version of the giant after more than a decade and so were the kids eager to see the monster on the screen in 3D. But sadly the experience turned out to be quite weird, since the film was completely different from the expectations raised and went on a surprisingly contrasting path dealing with nuclear plants, radiations, scientific researches and heavy gadgets instead of the monster.<br/><br/>In fact the most amusing news is that this time we don't have one but two distinctive varieties of Godzillas (3 in numbers) who fight with each other as rivals. The original monster we saw in the 1998 version plays the 'Good hearted Godzilla"" coming out as a savior killing the other two, only to return back into the sea probably for a long rest before the next sequel. Interestingly this second type here is called MUTO which means""Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism"" looking like some giant grasshoppers with thin legs. However what hurts the most is that despite having 3 instead of 1, there is no creature to be seen in a major part of the film, especially in the initial hour talking all about the radiations and nuclear energy.<br/><br/>Beginning well with some stunning 3D visuals and a brilliant emotional sequence between the couple in the nuclear plant (well enacted), the film goes on and on without introducing the hero (i.e. the Godzilla) for an hour or so. Plus it doesn't offer many exciting or entertaining moments later too, even in the giant fights painfully designed by the exceptional graphics team. As a result GODZILLA remains a major disappointment for most of its time with only occasional good sequences coming at intervals.<br/><br/>In short, after AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 this is another high on technique and low on content much awaited project delivering quite less than what was being expected. It has some amazing 3D graphics but remains a non- performer on the entertainment level right till the end, unfortunately. On a lighter note, even the kids said that they wished to see GODZILLA much more than just in a small guest role.<br/><br/>And as one of my friends said, the film can easily be summed up as, ""250 Ki Ticket Mein, Bas 35 Rupaye Ka Godzilla!"""

","I had already decided that I wont watch Godzilla coz I knew its gonna be awfully predictable and boring and gone are the days of such films. What changed my mind is the initial user reviews on IMDb. It was rated 9.2 just 2 days before the release and some even compared it with Nolan Movies. The CGI and 3D was good but as always all major scenes happen at night and you don't wanna watch that in 3D its awful. So now these beasts feed themselves soaking in radioactivity generated by nuclear power reactors and various other radioactive stuff. They remain underground and do not die is quite a Bizarre premise. just to make it different then the previous Godzilla movie they added few elements like beasts generating electromagnetic pulses, they feed by soaking in radioactivity and Godzilla has a super power and he saves the mankind from the beasts which is OK if it had a gripping story line. The story was very simple. Bryan Cranston was wasted he died even b4 the movie was half over. my rating 6/10 give it a miss"

It turned out a disappointment.<br/><br/>My comments on the movie are as follow: The plot twist is weak and gaps are there. The way things develop drives you to ask the question: ""seriously??"" Starting with Why would Ford go all the way to Japan in the 1st place? to get his dad out??. How did the agency capture the creature in the 1st place, after the destruction of the nuclear station 15 years back?? Fine fine.<br/><br/>Dr. Serizawa looks lost all the movie, stressed and has no clue about what is going on with that taking a dump look on his face if you know what I mean. He failed to understand the creatures after studying them for 15 years, but suddenly trusts in Godzilla and asks the people around him to trust him.<br/><br/>The combination between prime predator, nature balance and human nuclear is all mixed and messed up.<br/><br/>So suddenly Godzilla is the ultimate fighter to preserve the human civilization, and our super-hero. <br/><br/>The 2 creatures feed on radiations. But you know? let's nuke them? also the male and female run half the planet to meet of course on US soil! what a surprise,,, why? Why? just for the male to give her the nuclear missile to feed the unborn babies?? Frankly I dunno if they mate and the scene was cut in UAE! Lol! <br/><br/>So the creature is about to eat Ford but he gathers his grip and raise his gun!! <br/><br/>The last scene when Ford & Elle found each other is weak acting and injuries makeup are bad. <br/><br/>This movie is closer to Pacific Rim than Godzilla. It's all about giant creatures fights and destruction of cities."
"gizmomogwai","5","0","1","28 May 2014"," Godzilla, featuring a cameo by Godzilla
","The US just hasn't had much luck adapting the Godzilla legend; the latest attempt is better than Godzilla '98 and possibly King of the Monsters, but that's not saying much. Godzilla (2014) pits the title monster against two other giant creatures, Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms, which feed off radiation and pose a threat to humans once unleashed. The story is told from the perspective of an American family, a guy who lost his wife to a mysterious explosion and his son, in the Navy, who just wants to be with his own family.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat misnamed, as, indeed, Godzilla is barely in it at all. I've heard the director was influenced by Spielberg's Jaws (1975), in which the shark was kept hidden for much of the movie. Except, while we didn't see the shark, the film was certainly about the shark- we very much feel the shark's presence and see what it does to the community. This movie seems to take a while to get to the point, focusing on this family whose characters weren't particularly deep, with nothing particularly endearing. By the time the monsters do show up, it's mainly the MUTOs we see and hear about. And even then, we see far more of the human characters, mainly military characters and scientists outside the core characters we were following earlier, debating how to kill them. The whole point, the billed battle between Godzilla and the monsters, is confined to the climax and feels very brief. <br/><br/>Roger Ebert had a favourite story that comes to mind, about a reporter covering a flood who wrote ""God stood on a mountain top here today, and surveyed the damage that His floodwaters had wrought."" The editor replied, ""Forget flood. Interview God."" Forget all this, interview Godzilla."

","How many GODZILLA movies has there been? I for one have no clue. Never have I watched one either to draw comparison. What did I feel about this beast unleashed on the wide screen? It's plain and simple; it's entertaining but it's nothing out of the ordinary apart from the fact of the Monsters. It will be forgotten by the end of the summer but while you watch it, it's not that bad.<br/><br/>There is nothing insane in this movie. Frankly to begin with I was quite disappointed when I saw the first monster on screen. Although not having ever watched any of the predecessors I did have an idea of what GODZILLA would look like and that monster most certainly was not it. It looked like a massive cockroach from the first MEN IN BLACK movie. But then I sat there with my jaws open as the CGI and VFX took over and the historical creature rose out of the water. I am impressed! <br/><br/>With the best possible team ever behind the scenes it's an uncontested argument to say that visually we are in for a treat. Seamus McGarvey (AVENGERS ASSEMBLE - Cinematography), Jim Rygiel (LOTR, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN – VFX), Owen Patterson (THE MATRIX TRILOGY – Production Supervisor) Alexander Desplat (ZERO DARK THIRTY – Composer) serves it out in A-List Hollywood fashion. You don't need to know your movies to know the above titles. They are by far some of the most popular household names in Hollywood history. So hold on to your seats and get ready to be swept away with this visual extravaganza as everything you see is obliterated (literally).<br/><br/>As for the more core elements of the movie, the direction, the acting and the screenplay not much can be said. Let me start with the screenplay. Nothing is written in detail and no one is given enough room to grow intentionally. The focus as the title rightly says is on GODZILLA. But still a bit more detail into the characters and plot could have made it more thrilling. Remember LAKE PLACID? I cannot take a jab at the acting since they were given didly squat to work with and Aaron Taylor Johnson who plays Ford does the best that he can with what he is given. As for the BREAKING BAD star Bryan Cranston I am certain the fans would have preferred for him to stay along (Spoiler Alert). Lastly Gareth Edwards who is new to the Directors chair does justice and gives you nothing but GODZILLA.<br/><br/>The thrill in GODZILLA is not what is taking place in front of you. It is the chaos and carnage that happens in the background. Not the common movie enthusiasts cup of tea.

","Well, I hoped this would be a better movie than the 3D POMPEII, and my wish was granted - but only just. As with recent superhero movies - this, I guess, is a super-villain movie! - the writer and director have gone for a re-vamp. And they give us GOODzilla, helping humanity fight the giant bat-like dinosaurs who energise themselves by destroying nuclear power plants and digesting missiles. A lower-case wow.<br/><br/>Leading man Aaron Taylor-Johnson), not unlike the hero of the new/ancient POMPEII, is a low-rent version of Channing Tatum, and the script doesn't manage to layer any charisma on him or his wife (Elizabeth Olsen). The performances here are not even up to TV-movie standards.<br/><br/>Roland Emmerich's 1998 version of GODZILLA came in for a lot of flak from fans of the original clunky Japanese monster mash-ups of the 1950s, but the Emmerich film had more characters and a much busier storyline than this one. Today's GODZILLA, despite 3D and acres of CGI, is too obviously pitched, like the TRANSFORMERS series, at the toy-shop franchise. More thrilling than POMPEII, yes, but not much that's new here. A special-effects-laden package that turns out not to be very special at all."
"hhkbrown","4","0","1","27 May 2014"," Frustrating but watchable (warning, spoilers)
","Straight away I would like to say that this movie was a let-down for me, but being on a giant hype train pretty much made that inevitable anyway. Being let down by this movie didn't surprise me, but the way it let me down did. It wasn't the lack of constant action that bored me, but rather the lack of a human element. The first 20- 30 minutes of the film is very promising, then the only character I felt connected to died suddenly, and I was left with a stale, soulless cast of forgettable characters, who are merely there to push the plot forward. The film presented some cool concepts, and some of the fight scenes near the end looked exceptional, but I didn't feel drawn into the film because I didn't like or know anyone in the film, so I didn't care about their fate, so nothing mattered to me. And what things the characters did do were very stupid and illogical. Why did they put the bomb on a train and not straight away take it by helicopter like they did later? Why did they arm the bomb before moving it out to sea? Why did they take Bryan Cranston's character straight to their top secret base where the monster is held captive in the open for all to see? How did they not spot, or at least not feel the tremors, of the monster escaping the underground nuclear dump? Now, I'm not normally a person to pick at plot holes, but that's because I'm normally engrossed in a film to the point of suspension of disbelief. But this film was so cold, devoid of emotion and so full of characters talking about how ""clever"" the plot is and how ""complicated"" it is to take the monster down, that all I had left to focus on was the plot. And the ending was the nail in the coffin for me. This way it shows a news broadcast patronisingly saying something along of the lines of ""Our hero?"", showing Godzilla walking back into the ocean and then the film cutting off abruptly. I actually laughed in disbelief. I felt insulted. I'm glad the film was made in the way it brought Godzilla back, and it wasn't a bad film; the special effects were impressive and the intro was set up nicely. But the film wasn't good either. It had the potential to be so much more. Seeing as they were talking about how the monsters could wipe humanity off Earth, they didn't show a lot of suffering. This film, to me anyway, was boring."

Bryan Cranston has done a superb job, but he is there only for the first 2-4 scenes of the movie. The rest is carried out by his son Ford Brody played by Aaron Johnson but he doesn't actually do anything. There are no expressions from him, its just pure lame acting! Some characters are awkward and inconsistent. But Big G looks awesome! He isn't there in the movie much but towards the ending the movie looks awesome. The action is great and Godzilla finally ends up saving the city rather than destroying it. It comes to an unexpected ending. If you are a guy who loves action then don't watch Godzilla. Its not that fun.But its good overall."
"jacob-chiong","4","0","3","26 May 2014"," Disappointing show
","CGI is used in movies in one of two ways. One way is to have a collection of CGI effects and build a story around them. The other way is to craft the story first, then build the CGI effects to fit. Godzilla belongs to the former. There are portions where you get the feeling that, yes, the computer guy is showing off his CGI here. But when the CGI comes into the real world, you get the jarring realization that the computer guy knows his bits and bytes, but has little understanding of physical laws. For example, the huge Godzilla leaves almost no wake as it travels swiftly through the water just below the surface. And the huge foot of the other monster can step on a roof without the roof tiles and rafters caving in, considering that just a portion of that foot is as high as that building. Almost as incredible was seeing the monster tender-footing around the tiny railway tracks that span the valley without so much as brushing the tracks that lie between its legs. To be fair, I slept through parts of it, something that seldom happens when I spend a small fortune watching a 3D IMAX version of a movie. Throughout my waking minutes the phrase ""What the..."" pops up over and over."

","I had high hopes for this new edition of ""Godzilla"", but sadly, it fell short of my expectations. It was hyped that it would be more like the original 1954 classic but I didn't see it that way. Though the effects were quite good and Godzilla as vastly improved from the 1998 turkey with Matthew Broderick, the story was lacking character and depth. The story flow was disjointed and at the end, I felt that Godzilla was more of a sideline than the main attraction. His presence until near the end, was overshadowed by the insect things he was chasing and the story seemed to be about them. The acting was OK, but the characters seemed to be just killing time while trying to figure out if we could be saved. If I were to write this screenplay, it would have gone back to the original story with the love triangle between Imeko, her new boyfriend and Dr. Serizawa, and Godzilla would have appeared from Japanese legend, with only one thing in mind... destruction of a city. The film would have been re-done in black and white and it would basically be an updated version of one of the classic monster films of all time. One thing I was grateful for at the end of the Godzilla 2014, was that he was not killed. All in all, it was an entertaining 2 hours, but to think this film bore resemblance to the 1950's original, is off base. Hopefully someone will take hold of this wondrous story and do justice to it. In the meantime, I would suggest you get hold of a Blu Ray copy of the original Japanese version (no American scenes with Raymond Burr) and you will be treated to a monster classic."

","After the Emmerich/Brodrick fiasco of 98, I was all but done with Godzilla movies. So, when I first saw the teaser trailer for 2014's ""Godzilla"", I cringed at the thought of having to sit through another American remake starring this beloved movie monster. But what can I say? I'm a hug fan of ""Breaking Bad"" and Bryan Cranston is a God. So I went. But suffice to say, I wasn't so much as impressed as I was (by the end of my movie going experience) bored.<br/><br/>OK, so before I move forward with my criticism, I just wanted to make it clear that I had no problem with the overdramatic feel director Gareth Edwards uses as his foundation, even throughout the segments of cool visuals and the few strong action sequences in the final Act. To say that a Godzilla film is campy or overdramatic is not really an insult. It's like saying, grass is green or water is wet. In fact, the Japanese inspired camp of it all, is a huge reason as to why people love this franchise to begin with. Now, on to my review: Synopsis: In 1999, after what looks to be a natural disaster takes the wife of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) an American engineer stationed in Japan, we fast forward to present time as Joe (now a conspiracy theorist) along with his skeptical son Ford, attempt to uncover the truth behind the odd seismic activity off the coast of Japan. Seismic activity which may lead to the truth behind Joe's wife's death and by default lead them to the discovery of the greatest sea monster inspired cover up in history. From the title, you may have already guessed what this cover up pertains to.<br/><br/>The story, in and of itself, is actually quite inventive. That is to say, writer Max Borenstein does a really good job of bringing Godzilla into the modern age and backing his ""return"" with some logical reasoning. That said, if not for some timely exposition every half an hour from Ken Watanabe, who plays Dr. Ichio Serizawa, I would have been pretty confused as to what some of the motives of the main characters (Godzilla included) were.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is quiet, but very well choreographed, as the story slowly takes its shape, setting the stage for the arrival of the King of All Monsters. But as the second hour begins to rear its head, things almost all at once hit a wall, as the film continues to set a stage that is now getting cold. And what once looked to be a well structured exercise in suspenseful pacing, soon turned into an exercise of my patience; with every static moment losing that much more of my interest. And here's the kicker: Edwards definitely had a vision as to how and when Godzilla should make his first appearance on screen. And the fact that Godzilla isn't fully visible until the latter half of this film, proves that he wished to gradually elevate the anticipation of audiences. But when we finally do see him (Godzilla) my reaction was shrug inducing at best. This is what I'd been waiting for?! I mean, the last half an hour is action packed and gives fans what they came to see; Godzilla roaring and haphazardly destroying cities. And there are bits of wonderful touches of cinematography laced throughout, which pay direct homage to the old Japanese tokusatsu films that made Godzilla such a pop culture icon to begin with. All I'm saying is, I felt as though I was being hyped up for something visually Guillermo Del Toro inspired, and all I really got was something just above the level of Reptar.<br/><br/>Shockingly, the acting and the CGI were not up to par either. Well that isn't all together true. Elizabeth Olsen is quite good here. Problem is, she wasn't given much to do! Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and the aforementioned Olsenoh, and with (""with"" being the operative word) Bryan Cranston, ""Godzilla"" should have been a film where the CGI and performances were dueling for the spotlight. Sadly, both aspects fall short; with the (at times) lackluster CGI taking the lead. I'll say it again, Godzilla was visually quite underwhelming.<br/><br/>Taylor-Johnson is asked to carry this movie, but is pretty forgettable in the leading man role. And if you think Olsen gets nothing to do, then Academy Award nominee Sally Hawkins gets even less. As for Ken Watanabe (one of the most respected actors in the world) he spends the entire film with the same shocked expression on his face; which honestly is what the role called for, so I can't really fault him. And what can I say about Cranston's performance, since (spoiler alert) he's barely in the damn movie! Final Thought: If you are a fan of the original Japanese productions, the subject matter alone and/or a plot which harnesses the spirit of those cinematic classics will be enough for you to get through (or even enjoy) a two hour movie which feels like three hours. For the rest of us, ""Godzilla"" eventually and unfortunately turns into a slog, that even with its merits, is just too long. What some may see as a slow burn, others (like me) saw as a film that was in need of some heavy editing."

The scenario was less capable than one for a C-rated movie.<br/><br/>I wanted to see the movie in a big cinema with a popcorn box in hand.
