"jimhurcomb","8","70","81","28 February 2012"," It's all about the ""feel""
","There is one element that distinguishes a ""great"" sports movie from a ""good"" sports movie. It's ""the feel"". It doesn't matter if the movie is about baseball, basketball, football or hockey. If it doesn't smack of authenticity you might as well flip over to a live game. ""The Natural"" had the feel of baseball and for hockey ""Slapshot"" has always been the template for the great hockey movie. I happily add ""Goon"" to that rarefied space.<br/><br/>As far as movie making goes, it has all the right stuff. The acting is convincing and solid, the jokes are funny and there is lots of on-ice action. But the defining feature of this film is that it feels real. It feels like these are real guys playing a real game in front of real fans. True hockey fans will get the in jokes, wince at the ankle injury, relate to the dressing room banter, and feel tempted to yell ""head's up"" when the bad guy starts to take a run at the little guy.<br/><br/>The key scene is, of course, the final showdown between ""good goon"" and ""bad goon"". We know it's coming, but sometimes we know the NHL fights are inevitable, as the tough guys line up before the face-off and start jabbering. The build-up is just as visceral in ""Goon"", and when they finally drop the gloves it reminded me of that great final shoot-out scene in ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", as the guys do the pre-fight strip tease and wait for other to draw first.<br/><br/>I will risk the wrath of my fellow hockey fans who have grown up worshipping at the church of ""Slapshot"". It was a great movie, although a bit long. I found ""Goon"" to be more entertaining, as authentic and more believable. Nice work guys!"
"december_starz","8","75","89","25 February 2012"," If this is your type of movie, you won't be disappointed.
","I think that if you go to see this movie, you know what you're getting into. It's essentially a love letter to the violent side of hockey written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg, both of whom are known for a particular kind of comedy, and it stars Seann William Scott, who is known for playing a particular kind of character. Check out the 'People who liked this also liked...' section on the page for this movie. You'll see flicks like The Hangover, Crazy, Stupid Love, and Role Models. If those are your type of movies, chances are you'll enjoy Goon. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that a likable, polite, not-exactly-bright bouncer, Doug Glatt, is invited to join a semi-professional hockey team as an enforcer. I think what I chiefly liked about the film was that yes, there's lewd and crude humour and a somewhat predictable plot line, but you'll like the characters and at no point does the movie start to drag or fail to entertain. <br/><br/>I was also pleased to see that, as a Canadian hockey fan myself, I wasn't spoon-fed easy stereotype jokes. The things that were funny hadn't been recycled a hundred times in every other movie that pointedly features Canada as a setting. The characters do drag out the old 'eh' every now and again, but you feel more like it's a wink to Baruchel's home audience rather than something intended to hit you over the head with a 'SEE, we're in CANADA!'<br/><br/>Bottom line: This flick isn't going to win any Oscars. But if you want to see something thoroughly entertaining, it's a good bet. If you don't laugh at least once, you're - probably my grandmother."
"leana555","7","86","105","18 January 2012"," The trailer doesn't do this justice.
","I hadn't read or heard much about Goon before I went to see it; all I'd seen was the trailer. I didn't even realise that it was based on a true story. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>I was expecting that the funny bits in the trailer were all that would be on offer but the whole film was seeped in that simple (albeit sometimes unnerving) comedy that had the audience laughing out loud often. <br/><br/>Furthermore, beneath the usual humour we've come to expect from Goldberg, there is a much deeper underlying story to it. It was even endearing in parts. OK so 'endearing' isn't the best word to describe a comedy sports film that has as much gore as it has humour, but the way that Seann William Scott portrays Doug really did something of touching my heart, and it was refreshing to see Scott play the role.<br/><br/>Granted it may not clean up at the Oscars, but the story of a guy who really has no idea where he belongs is both hilariously and sweetly told in Goon, with a great relationship conveyed between Doug and his friend - excellently played by Baruchel - who seems to be the only one who believes in him.<br/><br/>Teamed (no pun intended) with the banter generated with the game of hockey and Doug's fellow players, this really makes for a must-see for any sports film fan, or comedy film fan, or indie film fan. There's a love story in there too for the romance fans. Which could potentially give Goon a pretty huge audience. If people ignore the trailer, that is.<br/><br/>Yes the whole story is slightly clichéd, but this film does so much more than the trailer gives it credit for, and deserves the word to be spread that this really is worth a watch."
"danhall76","8","80","100","23 January 2012"," Enjoyable Movie
","I must say I was a bit nervous as a Hockey fan about how this movie would fare in UK. There is a fairly good following but there are still a lot of people who don't realise that fighting is part of the game and that 'Goons' actually do play the game.<br/><br/>I thought there were some good laughs, entertaining fights and an overall heartwarming story that for me make this into a very entertaining movie. Yes, the dialogue and jokes are simple and the plot is quite thin but what were we expecting? Too many people expect movies to all be Oscar-contenders and don't see a film for what it is, in this case and entertaining comedy-drama that doesn't take itself even slightly seriously."
"K_Antivenin","9","41","54","27 February 2012"," Puttin' on the foil, coach.
","One of my all-time favorite comedies is Slap Shot, so I had at least a marginal interest in seeing Goon. After reading a recent interview with Baruchel in the Vancouver Sun, the movie sounded like it just might have the heart to carry the flame that Slap Shot lit. Sure, no question, Goon comes off as somewhat of an homage, but it's done right, not overtly, balancing the necessary brutality and tastelessness with just enough sweetness. Which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for that pitiful attempt at a Slap Shot sequel.<br/><br/>I'm also not usually a fan of Seann William Scott's typecast everybrah, but his portrayal of Dougie Glatt as a soft-spoken and polite bruiser really is charming. The movie's not without its flaws: Sure, Baruchel's character is irritating and barely necessary, and Eugene Levy is tragically underused, and the subplot with the love interest is kinda out-of-place, but I overlooked those things because the meat of the movie is gold. The comedy is solid, the teammate/coach characters are amazing, and the film's sheer love of the game really, really shines through.<br/><br/>So my recommendation is ya pick up a twelve of Moosehead, throw on your old Chiefs jersey, and hunker down for a lot of laughs."
"bonzybino","7","37","50","14 March 2012"," bloody, gritty & sporty!!
","I wasn't expecting the bloodshed in an otherwise heartfelt and appeasing movie which would be remembered for the astonishing, rather absorbing performance by Sean William Scott more than anything else. I should admit, haven't yet got the hang of Ice hockey and the fighting thing. But the sportiness and the spirit of the protagonist did rush my ante up - now that's not uncommon with Sport movies. But something's different about this one, Doug Glatt & his 69 wouldn't be that easy to forget coz he's too simple, stupid and darn crazy when he's a team guy.<br/><br/>With some good laughs, a love affair and a tough antagonist, it might sound quite clichéd. Yet you would never feel tedious, rather you feel for the rawness and emptiness Doug Glatt is going through. His blending with the team, the crush he develops for the girl, the way he pushes out the baddies from cornering Laflamme, and the final wait for fighting the evil legend is all knitted very well. The background score keeps the tempo intact. Some of the scenes and circumstances needed much detail, it never went over board being too dramatic. For instance, the climax was a bit ragged and missed out some emotional values. Sean William Scott deserves special mention, he sheds all his typecast personas and have acted the character of Doug Glatt with all his heart. Thank God, he isn't just ""Steve Stifler"" anymore.<br/><br/>Goon is a feel good movie which is simple yet compelling and a bit too bloody for a sports movie. Loved it."
"tomhemingway11","7","45","62","10 January 2012"," Pleasantly surprised at the years first 'dumb' comedy.
","'Goon' revolves around a very simple idea that a lovable but stupid nobody gets a chance at becoming an ice hockey champion because of his very powerful fists. Cue some of the most incredibly violent, unnecessary fight scenes seen in cinema for a long time. It makes a Quentin Tarantino film look normal! However, If you buy the idea, despite the familiar and predictable narrative, you will leave the cinema with a big grin on your face; At heart, 'Goon' is just another Indie feel-good comedy.<br/><br/>Written by Jay Baruchel (also starring) and Evan Goldberg (the man to thank for 'Superbad' & 'Pineapple Express'), the words come to life on screen and audiences should delight in some incredibly amusing one-liners (watch out for the foul-mouthed Baruchel) but also be engaged in the kind hearted and naive Sean William-Scott. You will realise after a while that the pacing of the film is unorthodox as it doesn't focus on the story of the ice hockey team, rather than the 'Goon' himself. This shows a focus which is integral to the film's unique quality and it often takes many unexpected turns as far as typical narratives go. The Goon is the heart of this film and has many redeeming features. This softer approach to a predictably comic performance from William-Scott and the introduction of a possible love story between him and Alison Pill's character (also giving her best shot in this picture) are what elevates the film to a level most comedy's fail to reach.<br/><br/>Having said that, this film is no 'Juno' or '(500) Days Of Summer'. It mixes the soft, charming and comedic elements with often harsh truths and big fights. There is blood, lost teeth, broken bones and sliced ankles throughout. Never has there been such realistic sounding punches! However, in the end, 'Goon' proves that you don't need a film crammed full of laughs to make a good comedy. It has charm, honesty, some very big fights, some very funny moments and an undeniably uplifting, feel-good ending which makes it just that cut above your average 'dumb' comedy."
"DonFishies","7","74","109","31 October 2011"," A lot of fun when you embrace the ridiculousness of it all
","I plead ignorance: I have never seen Slap Shot, the holy grail of non- Mighty Ducks hockey films. When I ventured into the world premiere of Michael Dowse's Goon over a month ago at the Toronto International Film Festival, I felt like I missed out on required reading. But while it may be deeply indebted to the Paul Newman classic, I think Goon still manages to be unique enough that it works pretty well on its own. <br/><br/>Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a loser. His father and brother are doctors, yet he is stuck as a bouncer in a seedy Orangetown bar. A rather heinous act of self-defense at a local hockey game gets him noticed and brought in to play in the minors as a goon, someone who fights with others and protects his smaller teammates. He does so incredibly well that he is quickly drafted to a semi-professional team in Canada, where his main goal is to protect star player Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), who has not played the same since a brutal hit from the legendary Ross 'The Boss' Rhea (Live Schreiber).<br/><br/>Goon is the type of movie that begs not to be taken seriously. If the synopsis was not enough, then the key opening shot, a bloody tooth falling in slow motion over classical music, is an obvious suggestion of the borderline ludicrous film that follows. There is nothing subtle that occurs at all, everything is incredibly blatant and wildly over-the-top (and frequently incredibly gritty and disgusting). The film wears its pride for the sport on its sleeve, and sometimes goes to ridiculous lengths to make sure you always know that. While hockey seems to be an oddly frequent theme in Canadian pictures in the past year or so, this was the first one I saw that had the sport front and centre – not simply existing as an underlying theme or plot device. <br/><br/>But what sets it apart from the other Canadian hockey films is its glorification of violence and carnage on ice. Glatt's main objective is to destroy and take out the other players, and everyone around him is constantly stressing that. While we get to witness the struggle he has trying to understand if there will ever be anything more for him, the film still paints him in the corner of always needing to fight, which leads to some horrifically bloody battles. Dowse does not shy away from how violent the sport can be; instead he makes it incredibly gratuitous and takes it dangerously close to the limits of decency. I laughed at how silly the violence became, but I was surprised at just how gory it was in many instances. It will no doubt cause a minor controversy, and I would not be surprised if a lot of people ignore the fact that the film is one of the few to actually deal with the topic head-on.<br/><br/>Goon is also set apart through its rather colourful use of profanity, specifically at the hands of Jay Baruchel's Pat Houlihan. He adapted and co-wrote the script with Seth Rogen's usual writing partner Evan Goldberg , and spices up almost every line with a unique expletive. Some are too overdone for their own good, but others are near perfect. They lead to some rather hysterical one-liners more often than not, and help shape the film around the hockey. I found it particularly amusing that Baruchel gets to be the most vulgar of anyone in the script, allowing him to provide the most laughs and steal scenes from everyone. It also makes the film, at least in my mind, a bit more authentic to the sport itself. It can be family orientated as some films have tried to suggest, but it is much more at ease when it is adult.<br/><br/>If I hold anything against the film (outside of the ending I wanted so much more from), it is that no one is really developed at all. We get to see a few different shades of Scott's Glatt, but no one else in the film changes. They are one-dimensional all around, with some minor throwaway moments that could have been used to better characterize them. It feels like a missed opportunity, even with the short running time, and nearly puts the talented cast to waste. Even Scott himself seems to be having trouble trying to really make something of his character. They all make the most of what they are given, but it seems like the acting must have come a close third to the sensationalizing of hockey and the glorifying of violence.<br/><br/>That said, Scott does a lot better in the role than I want to give him credit for. He is very meek throughout, and is always downplaying the character. He is the complete opposite of Stifler, and shows that he has some range. Schreiber is great as Ross, but he leaves the film for far too many interludes. Same goes for Kim Coates as the head coach of Glatt's team, who never appears on screen for nearly long enough. Sadly, Grondin and Alison Pill, as Glatt's love interest, seem to fare the worst of anyone. They get so very little to do, despite their importance in the film. They just end up looking awkward and out of place more often than not, almost like they do not belong at all.<br/><br/>In the end, there is a lot of fun to be had watching Goon, especially if you really embrace the ridiculousness of it all. It is a really silly film, but manages to be enjoyable even with the massive flaws that plague it. With a little more work, it could have been one of the best sports movies ever. Instead, it will have to contend with being the best among a long string of Canadian hockey movies that will hopefully end sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>7/10."

"jordanmarkharding","8","23","33","21 January 2012"," Expectedly underrated
","In a very short summary, this has got to be the best tongue in cheek comedy for a very long time because its not all about a dumb hockey player there is heart in there, ambition and best of all, love. Cheesy I know, tell me about it. As a non spoiler synopsis, the movie is about a family outcast, Doug 'goon' Glatt who is superb with his fists and is recruited to play hockey but only to be on ice fist. His soon to be ex hero, Ross Rhea is also good with his fists and a is a famous on pitch trouble maker. The film follows Doug through many games with plenty of punch throwing intertwined and also inevitably leads to a head to battle between Rhea and Glatt. In the end this is a massively underestimated movie and deserves more to be honest. Watch it you will not be disappointed."
"intelearts","10","11","14","15 March 2012"," 494th Review: One of the best, the very best, sport comedy out there
","This is a lot smarter than some reviewers are giving it credit for - it's tough, even nasty on the ice, but seriously not only laugh out loud, but it's also a wonderful inspirational film that both moved and surprised this reviewer.<br/><br/>Full of great performances, especially Seann WIlliam Scott and Jay Baruchel (who co-wrote) and Liev Schrieber, the surprise though is Kim Coates, who with over 40 films to his credit, is a well-known face, but here is seriously the most realistic coach I've seen on film in a while.<br/><br/>If you like sports movies you should love this, yes it is raw in the fights and the language, but that's where a lot of the real laughs come from - but what makes this really worth watching is that it's about the unsung hero, the underdog, the loser finding love, finding a home, and I for one loved every minute of it."
"hippy_hazy","7","25","37","21 January 2012"," Good laughs
","Seann William Scott often fits into a certain type, to put it bluntly, silly films. After following his favourite hockey player, Doug (Scott) goes from bouncer at a pub to pro hockey player, seems to fit the bill.<br/><br/>I didn't think much of the film or the story in the first say, twenty minutes. It just seemed to be in competition with the likes of Superbad and dare I say, American Pie. With Doug's best friend Ryan (Jay Baruchel) making obscene jokes every 5 seconds, I couldn't help but role my eyes. When the story moves away from him, is when the film really starts to pick up. We get to see what Scott's character is really like, which is a polite, cute, neanderthal with really hard fists.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber's character is rather terrifying, creating a great juxtaposition between him and the dimwitted Doug. The camera angles used on the ice show how scary it can be and bring the audience into the match. Now that I know it's based on a true story, I only want to meet the real Doug and give him a hug."
"cormac_zoso","9","6","7","29 August 2012"," Old-Time Hockey ... Eddie Shore ... Eddie Shore ...
","Just wow ... that's all I can say ... I never expected to see another sports movie let alone another in the very small hockey genre that would approach the all-time classic, ""Slap Shot"", but this is the little goon that could. Outstanding flick that any hockey fan would love. While I see many people here talking about the ridiculousness of the fighting, frankly, I stopped watching hockey after they made so many pussy rule changes after the Broad Street Bullies fought, gouged and chewed their way to a Stanley Cup. That was hockey, my friends, and ""Goon"" lives up to the great names of Bobby Clarke and Dave ""The Hammer"" Schultz (I guess we'll have to say ""The Original Hammer"" now after during the credits of this movie we see a minor league goon with the same nickname) and the legend of Dave ""The Family"" Manson who played for the Blackhawks in the 90s and broke Schultz' long-standing single-season penalty minutes record and they didn't even include the 20-some games he was suspended that year (the longest suspension coming when he returned to the ice after ejected and saw on the TV that the fight was still going on and returned to the ice to dive into a small pile ... unfortunately, a ref happened to be tangled up in the small pile and so he was suspended even longer ... but amazingly enough, Manson learned to be a good player and not just a goon. But that was a wonderful season we all look back on with a little tear in our eye for that wonderful 150-lbs goon ... yeah you read that right ... this guy was the size of Wayne ""The Pussy"" Gretske and fought like The Hammer. Unbelievable! Now that's hockey, my friends.<br/><br/>Great hockey movies are pretty rare. But ""Goon"" is right behind ""Slap Shot"" as the greatest. This should be a double-feature on the first and last day of hockey season. Great swearing in this movie also and since most of it is done by a kid with a Boston accent (the lovable sidekick played by Jay Baruchel who really is the only young guy now who can pull off the pretty annoying sidekick needed in any movie like this) or by Canadians (it's a minor league hockey movie so you can't swing a broken goalie mask without hitting one) or by guys missing half a dozen of their front teeth you need to watch it a few times to catch all the very creative swearing.<br/><br/>Seann William Scott plays the lead, the Goon, and does a great job. He's been in every dumb movie aimed at the dumb kid or drunk and dumb adult demographic since ""American Pie"" (perhaps the worst excuse for a comedy ever made) ... all those movies are the same just with different character names which baffles me as to why they even bother changing the names. Like it would make a difference.<br/><br/>But he does a good job here delivering on the very dumb BUT self-aware Goon. This is really an important part of the film. His parents try to tell him he's smart enough to do anything, to become a doctor, like they are. And he says no, I'm not. I'm dumb.<br/><br/>This is revelatory in this comedy since most scripts would just keep him being dumb, everyone calling him dumb, and him nodding like a bobble-head dog in the back window of an Impala. But he realizes he's dumb and what's more, he realizes that being a hockey goon, contributing to the team, is the best thing he can do in his life. It's his ""thing"". Early in the movie he complains, again in a surprising moment of self-awareness, that his friend has his ""thing"" (his best buddy does a local cable access hockey show and website), his parents have their ""doctor thing"", but he doesn't have a thing. We see him hardly going through the motions of being a bouncer at a local bar. The boss having to point out things he should be doing, having to prod him to pound the bejesus out of a troublesome customer when he was already stopping at just a good old alley ass kicking. This young man is searching. He's searching like Grasshopper in Kung Fu, searching for his place in this world, searching for his thing. It's a deep philosophical thing most of you won't grasp but don't let it deter you from this fine film.<br/><br/>And he finds it. And on top of that, he finds the love of his life, the heavy boozing and very slutty local hockey bimbo played quite convincingly by the adorable Alison Pill. And when she tells him that he makes her feel like ""she wants to stop sleeping with a bunch of guys all the time"" well my friends, this old hockey fan's eyes were pretty damp I must admit. Just like Rhett telling Scarlet, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" brings a tear to everyone's eyes, well that is the same feeling, the same depth of emotion this little slut brings to that scene. (Oh, that might have sounded like I was saying that the actress Pill was a slut ... I actually don't know if she is .. though if she is and if she reads this, please drop me a line honey. I'll help you get through those horny nights, no problem).<br/><br/>So break out the foil, look up Eddie Shore's stats, bite down hard on your lip and taste some blood, then wash that down with some Lebatt or Molson and pop this flick in for the first of a hockey double-header with ""Slap Shot"".<br/><br/>You won't mind losing a tooth when you stumble to the bathroom to vomit and trip over your adolescent daughter and bash your mouth against the bowl. You'll rejoice in looking like a goon."

Sean William Scott is a pleasant surprise since usually you see him as a wise cracking smart a--. He definitely can play more serious roles if given the chance but does a great job I feel with his role in this movie. Liev Schreiber was good as well. He definitely plays a good role as an enforcer.

"brando647","9","5","6","9 September 2012"," A Hilarious Feel-Good Underdog Movie
","I am not a hockey fan. I've never watched it, never attended a game, and I could probably only name one or two NHL teams if pressed. But I am a fan of Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg so, hockey fan or not, I knew was giving GOON a chance. I'd read a really positive review of it out of last year's Toronto International Film Festival but, of course, it never got a wide release so I had to wait. It was worth the wait because I really, really liked this movie. The characters feel real, the gags are funny, and the action is brutal. The plot is pretty simple when you break it down: Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott) is a bouncer for a local dive bar and the black sheep of his family, with both his brother and father maintaining successful medical careers. Doug's just not smart enough to continue in their line, but he is great at fighting. His brutal talents are witnessed by a local hockey coach when he batters a player from the local Orangetown Assassins and Glatt's hockey career begins when he's trained as an enforcer. His role is to protect the more talented players on his team, usually through bloody beatdowns. Glatt's career takes off and he finds himself in the minor leagues where he tries to help inspire the Halifax Highlanders to their first championship in years while building to the eventual battle with legendary enforcer and one of Glatt's heroes, Ross ""the Boss"" Rhea (Liev Schreiber).<br/><br/>This movie is so well done that I was almost tempted to start watching hockey until I learned that the violence has been toned down a lot in the past decade or so. Even though the Highlanders' championship aspirations are only a subplot in the scope of the movie, I found myself excited during the games and had to remind myself that their success isn't the end goal of the movie. It's all about Doug rising through the ranks and finding his own form of success in his life. Regardless, the hockey scenes in this movie are pretty awesome. The fights are the highlight though, and they can be savage. Doug is a beast. He may be the worst hockey player in the league but he can dish a beating as well as he takes them. Everything builds up to the big final confrontation where the new fan favorite fights the retiring legend, and it will have you flinching. But the movie is more than just rearranging faces; it's a genuinely funny comedy. None of the gags felt forced or stupid with one major exception: Jay Baruchel. Yes, I said I was a fan but that doesn't mean he can do no wrong and his character is one of the most annoying I've seen. Baruchel is Pat, Glatt's best friend and host of a public access hockey show. He's loud, vulgar, and constantly in your face when he screams nearly every line. Oddly enough, he's the weakest part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>The casting for the movie was perfect (I'm assuming Baruchel's character was just written to be incredibly annoying). Sean William Scott has more talent than I've given him credit for in the past. He's played so many buffoons in the past, and it's good to see him come across as a little more down to earth. Sure Doug is dumb, but he's also endearing, noble, and endlessly optimistic. He's a great guy; he just happens to be really talented at throwing punches and so that's what he does. Scott's character is what makes this movie so effective. You feel for the guy and you really want him to come out on top, whether it be in his hockey career or his chasing local nymphomaniac Eva (Allison Pill). Eva, on the other side of the spectrum, is not a good person and she admits to this, but she sees something irresistible in Doug's naivety and good nature. She's cute without being hot and, despite her glaring flaws, you want Doug to get the girl. His teammates are where the real laughs come from here: Kim Coates (team manager Ronnie Hortense), Richard Clarkin, Jonathan Cherry, Ricky Mabe, and especially George Tchortov and Karl Graboshas. Aside from Ricky Mabe, I haven't really heard of any of them, but they all have hilarious chemistry as a team. GOON is one of those feel-good movies and it does it's job well, even for someone who couldn't care less about hockey like me."

","Watched this with my wife recently. Had nothing to really go see at the Theater and decided to take a chance on it. She usually does not enjoy most movies I enjoy but we both really enjoyed this one. I found by the end of the movie I was literally on the edge of my seat for the final show down between the 2 major teams. I highly recommend this movie. Well worth a watch :)Like the previous reviewer stated. It did feel like a ""Real"" hockey movie. Seems these days it is really hard to capture that real sport feel without also going too far and making it very hokey. I will for sure buy this one on DVD when it comes out. This movie did seem very fresh and original. Seems almost every movie that has come out the past few years have been recycled from other movie ideas. Great to have a fresh take on a hockey movie, especially one based on a true story. Nice to see Jay Baruchel as a co-writer as well. Great job."

That film, too, is about a hockey player who can't do much more than fight, but is determined to keep his team protected. The only difference is that the song seemed to be more about a man's personal dream of being a successful hockey player despite his poor performances in games, while Goon pretty much stops at ""a man who is good at fighting on ice."" But that doesn't mean it's not an efficient comedy. Rather than creating a desperately unlikable character and tacking on a contrived romance, like in Happy Gilmore, Goon constructs a likable, if not simple-minded character who we come to not only sympathize with, but yet, kind of love. The character is Doug Glatt, played very well by Seann William Scott. Glatt isn't as smart as his father and brother, whom are both doctors, and feels extremely isolated because of it. His best friend, played by the unnecessarily vulgar and crude Jay Baruchel, takes him to a hockey game one day where, after a fight with a player, Doug finds out he has a knack for fighting.<br/><br/>This brings him to the attention of a coach who recruits Doug as team enforcer, where he is expected to protect the players and the team at all times. At first, Doug can't skate or even control a puck, but he proves to be more than a fighting caricature later on in his career.<br/><br/>The film is inevitably sweet and pretty heartfelt, despite its simple nature. There is a love story, which the film could do without, but the film refuses to become gooey or heavy-handed and simply looks at it as a secondary plot-point rather than an obligation in storytelling. The direction by Michael Dowse, of Take Me Home Tonight fame, is well done and there's a very nice coherency during the fight scenes.<br/><br/>As far as the fight scenes go, I was expecting them to be rushed, cartoony, and a bit too comical, but they're not. They're actually gritty, realistic, and a little dark. They show a bit of wear after fight number four or five, but the direction, setup, and pacing that comes before these fights does the best it can to avoid redundancy. It actually works quite favorably.<br/><br/>Written by Baruchel and Superbad's Evan Goldberg, Goon is a comedy about a likable character who does unlikable things because he is good at them. There's nothing totally wrong with that. It's not like in Super, where a man runs around in tights bashing peoples' heads in with a wrench because they cut in line at a movie theater. Doug Glatt isn't a monster - he's a character. One who becomes developed more than the simple plot would lead us to believe. This is a fun comedy. Not urgent, exciting, or a laugh riot, but a fun, character-driven comedy with heart. We need more of those today.<br/><br/>Starring: Seann William Scott, Jay Baruchel, and Eugene Levy. Directed by: Michael Dowse."
"JayG20","7","4","5","7 March 2012"," If art imitates life, then 'Goon' is no exception
","Jay Baruchel is seemingly very patriotic and enjoys embracing his Canadian heritage, which is often reflected in his work. In a scene in his film 'Knocked Up,' Jay's character was asked what the tattoo of the maple leaf on his chest represented. With unyielding pride, he responds, ""this is a tribute to my country and my countrymen,"" a line which couldn't be more accurate or befitting in describing his latest screenplay and big-screen writing debut, 'Goon.'<br/><br/>'Goon' encapsulates heart, humour and hockey, all the major elements of a good old-fashioned Canadian-spirited movie, and like any respectable Canadian, it always remembers its ""Ehs"" and ""Thank Yous.""<br/><br/>Seann William Scott plays the title character well, and it would surprise me if the real Doug was not satisfied with the portrayal. But Scott does take the phrase ""break a leg"" much too literally, and the film's art directors don't hold back in splashing blood wherever they can.<br/><br/>The film makes the most out of its disclaimer warning viewers of its violent nature, which is evident from beginning to end. The film's fight scenes, particularly the final showdown, are gruesome and gory, and at times will make your face cringe and your body shiver. That is unless you have a very high threshold for pain and can stomach it when you see it being inflicted on another person, even if it is just being acted. The graphic artists are good and accentuate these scenes as much as possible.<br/><br/>Like the torrents of slow-motioned blood splatter, you're sure to be overwhelmed by the sexually-explicit, inappropriately rampant, definitively outlandish, unmitigated and brazen dialogue. 'Goon' puts to shame any movie that has ever been assigned an R-rating for its profanity and coarse language. That said, I do think that the dialogue will be what viewers remember most from this film. The brash and outspoken remarks from the naturally corky Baruchel are absolutely hysterical, as are the exchanges between Scott and his character's love-interest Eva, played by Alison Pill. Every movie seems to have a place for a romantic side story, even Goon, and Pill has one of the best lines in the entire movie.<br/><br/>It is difficult to ignore the intensely revealing graphic content, but it is impossible not to appreciate the heart of the lead character, the humour in the dialogue, and the game of hockey that is proudly Canadian."

","Saw this yesterday at the cinema and while it was only me and my girl and a few other people, we all laughed at some point or other. It's hardly going to win any awards but it entertains and that's what you pay for at the end of the day. Seann William Scott does well as the dim psycho. I reckon this year will be something of a comeback for him, with this and 'American Reunion' on its way. The film is something we've seen done before with the like of 'The Waterboy' and so on, but this is much more violent. And the punch-ups are really what people are going to see this for. The violence is often hilarious but is still likely to offend certain people. Most of the fights had me popping off anyway. I thought the actors did a good job overall. The girl who played Eva was half hot, Liev Schreiber nearly stole the show, the French player did well and even the annoying friend made me laugh a few times. 'Goon' isn't going to win points for originality but for laughs and entertainment it just about succeeds. Well you already know what your going see. ***/*****"

This movie is surprising to me for there are not many comedies made nowadays that are very well presented/original. I would like to say I am a sports fan as well, but the National Football League doesn't quite encompass all sports. I would recommend this film as a solid and quite humorous comedy that will be a nice viewing for guys and gals alike. A bit clichéd storyline but it works very well in this case.

","I finally endured 2 hours of The Artist and was very disappointed that it had no depth and no plot. I paid to go to a movie that made me fall asleep midway through the film. So when I came across GOON I was so happy I found a film with so much heart. About 2/3's of the way through the movie, I thought it was a stroke of brilliance to have the main character suspended from hockey for one game so that the viewer could focus on the protagonist's moment of reflection. When Doug finally comes up with my stomach light needs your stomach light and we could both phone home together from ET, I was struck by how many levels this movie goes after. Instead of being fuelled by toxic jealousy from Xavier, we get a humble little proposal of a solution from Doug in the form of a bedtime soliloquy. Yes there's the comedy, the hockey action,there's a love interest, but for me what struck me the most was the brotherly relationships that these guys have for each other.<br/><br/>They end up having to protect each other because they are all on the same team and no one wants to get hurt real bad. The other great scene involves Doug and Ross in the diner at 3am. Totally unexpected. These two goons end up discussing how they mutually respect each other and then Ross tells Doug that if boundaries are crossed, Ross is not going down without a fight because he wants to retire a fighting hero. It seemed like such a civilized, gentlemanly exchange between the two. Personally I never like to watch hockey games in real life, but I definitely understood the guerrilla mentality of these men, and the compassion they have for one another on and off the ice.<br/><br/>Goon actually made me think whereas the Academy Award winning picture The Artist made me yawn."

","What would you think of a movie called Goon? I honestly had no idea what to expect, except from some of the previews. That said, straight out of the gate I was laughing. In fact, I laughed over and over throughout the entire film. So amusing. It really was a fun time out at the movies. Just watched the trailer and laughed again. Do yourself a big favour and see this movie! The acting was very good and Liev Schreiber is fantastic. If you liked Scott Pilgrim vs the World you most assuredly like Goon. I say that because ""Kim the drummer"" (Allison Pill) plays the lead female role opposite Seann William Scott. Both fit their roles perfectly. Jay Baruchel (who was one of the writers) has a great voice for comedic roles, but may have been over the top. Didn't matter, I wouldn't change a thing."

Believe it or not it is based on a true story of a hockey player who played in the Novia Scotia league who was a Goon who had 0G 0A and had over 300 Penalty Minutes because all he did was fight.<br/><br/>In conclusion if you are a hockey fan or just want to see a fall out of your chair comedy about hockey, Goon is the right movie for you."

I grew up watching the so-called ""Goons,"" I am a lifelong Red Wings fans so I have seen the Bob Proberts, Darren McCartys, and Joey Kocurs. The goon was an enduring thing in hockey and with the exception of the minor leagues (where this movie takes place) these type of players are pretty much a thing of the past.

","Now I like Sean William Scott and had hoped that this would continue after seeing this movie. I am pleased to say that if anything he has gone up in my regard. The last ice hockey film I saw was Youngblood (that Raki man is a F***ing animal) to quote a young Keanu Reeves. The plot of this film is simple enough. Doug Glatt (Sean W.Scott) is handy with his fists and for this gets taken on by the local ice hockey team as the enforcer whose main role is to protect the fallen prodigy Xavier Laflemme (Marc-Andre Grondin) whose overall performance was average. The film leads up to the big final, which isn't the game itself but a showdown between Doug Glatt and the ice hockey leagues number one hard Ba****d Ross Rhea played by the outstanding Liev Schreiber. Not here's an actor who has the ability to create chemistry with his fellow actors. What I really liked was the connection you started to feel towards Doug Glatt which is all down to Sean W.Scott performance. I wouldn't go to the cinema to watch it, but certainly as a rental. This for me was really watching Forest Gump play ice hockey and then smack the s**t out of someone."
"kalijunk","7","5","10","10 January 2012"," Let the brawl begin - an entertaining Hockey tale
","""Dumb as puck"" the movie poster proclaims, as you're greeted by a cheesy tooth-guard covered smile by Sean William Scott, giving away the central plot of a highly predictable film. However I have enjoyed previous mindless Sean William Scott films (Balls Out, Dude Where's my Car, Role Models etc), so expected this to be no different. Nor was I disappointed. The Goon is a light hearted film that doesn't take itself seriously, and makes for some enjoyable light viewing. The acting, direction or story aren't too deep, but the end result is very watchable none the less. Doug Glatt (Scott) is an underachieving member of a Jewish family in small-town America, who struggles in keeping up with conversations of more than a sentence. Doug is basically a puppy hiding in a Rhino's body and any violence resulting from his job as a bouncer/security man is oft times regretted in advance. Doug accidentally stumbles into a job on a local ice hockey team (as an assassin or a tank) and soon impresses with his single minded determination to stand (and fight) for what he's told is right. Well that and an uncanny ability to sustain and dish out copious amounts of violence. As Doug's star and career are on the ascendant, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) is following the opposite trajectory. As the ageing veteran being relegated progressively to teams of lower standing, Rhea is a one man wrecking crew seemingly on a collision course with Doug. The violence is gratuitous and at times, cartoonish, but somehow deeply satisfying. The film maintains a good steady pace, though I thought it floundered a bit in the second half. I enjoyed this film a lot, and found myself laughing out loud in places, and cheering on in wide eyed amazement in the fight scenes. Overall I would rate this film 6.5 on 10 and would recommend a watch if you've got an unlimited card and 2 hours to spare or on the DVD."
"Meven_Stoffat","3","9","22","1 March 2012"," Like its main character, Goon can't seem to get its head in the game
","I assume every Canadian knows the age-old joke by now: ""I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out."" I, myself, am not a fan of hockey, so I guess it's my own fault for going into movie thinking I'd like it, but I'll admit a Canadian film with Scott and Schreiber in it had me sold. I even paid the extra $8 to experience the most nauseating D-Box experience of my life. Ouch.<br/><br/>Goon is supposedly based on a true story of a fighter who was trained to skate and be a hockey player, and was famous for sucking at hockey but beating the snot out of his opponents. Except, just replace the word ""fighter"" with ""bouncer"", and you have the 95 minute exercise in idiocy that is Goon, a comedy so depressingly boring. it's essentially Moneyball with tons of blood and gore, and without the classy charm.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of the movie were gloriously entertaining. The opening fight scene on ice and the bloody tooth falling on the ice. That was brilliant. When we're introduced to the Main character is where the film starts getting slightly weak, however. So, you're telling me this guy is all adorkable and awkward, yet he has no problem beating people to a bloody pulp? Well, even then I was enjoying the film.<br/><br/>However, when we meet his love interest, the film falls flat on his face. People considered the relationship between the hobo and the hooker in Hobo With A Shotgun to be unbelievable, but this makes it look like a tabloid story. In fact, the love aspect reminded me of Twilight at times (take a wild guess as to whether or not that's a compliment). Then we get clichéd ""gets the girl"" ending? Frack right off. I've dropped turds more believable than that.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the protagonist is just boring. He's given very few funny lines to work with, he has little to no personality whatsoever, and we're supposed to love him based on mere fighting skills alone. The most interesting character, Liev Schreiber's is only in it for five minutes. And the fight at the end isn't even redeeming at all either. <br/><br/>But the worst problem with the film? It's BORING. the first 20 minutes are the funniest (not a good sign), the villain is interesting yet boring, the film doesn't use fight content to its full potential, there's no restraint at all whatsoever in the film... It's all just one big mess.<br/><br/>If you like being beat over the head with BS, I guess see Goon, but for the rest of us, Goon is a disposable comedy to stock video store shelves with, and a huge disappointment considering the potential it all had."

"tbmforclasstsar","7","3","5","7 March 2012"," a very funny celebration of the often forgotten members on the ice
","It is hard to say that the film ""Goon"" is not enjoyable. Full of lowbrow laughs, ridiculous fight scenes, and sympathetic characters, writers Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg have created a pretty hilarious comedy. On the other hand, they do it in a messy fashion and cover a topic that has become a great concern to much of their target audience.<br/><br/>The film ""Goon"" stars Seann William Scott in the not-so-ordinary role of sympathetic loser (at least for him anyway). Scott plays Doug Glatt, a bouncer at a bar who is discovered by a low level hockey coach that sees the potential Doug has as a hockey enforcer. Though he isn't a solid skater, has no background in hockey, and is an incredibly nice guy, Doug has the fists of a god and knows how to win a fight. Doug agrees to join the team and soon becomes an enforcer to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>While the story is fairly simple and the character of Doug is extremely lovable, I was surprised to see how poorly the film moved along. While Baruchel is new to writing (he plays Doug's friend Ryan in ""Goon"" and is known for his roles in ""Knocked Up,"" ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"") Goldberg has been a co-writer on several huge comedies, such as ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express"" (both co-written by Seth Rogen). With a couple huge films like these under his belt, I would expect a little more than what came from ""Goon.""<br/><br/>The main problem with the story structure is everything seems rushed. Doug goes from a bouncer, to a hockey player that doesn't know how to skate, to an enforcer beating down opponents all in the first fifteen minutes of the film. He falls in love with a girl (played by Alison Pill) and she starts to love him back in two minutes of film time. He moves up to a mid-level hockey team within the first half hour of the film. It seems rushed and poorly planned, even if the happenings in the film are funny.<br/><br/>There are also characters that seem to have no role in the film at all when they should. Doug's parents (his father played by Eugene Levy) and brother seem like they will be an important part of Doug's life, but his parents disapproval doesn't affect Doug. Their absence is sudden and the fact they don't return or learn to accept Doug seems strange, albeit a nice departure from the cliché of sports films.<br/><br/>While all of this was designed rather poorly, there is no denying this movie is funny and that Seann William Scott can even carry the straight role of a comedy. Sure, Scott has his funny moments and his nice guy character has some pretty great quirks, but he is essentially the driving force to keep the movie going, when he usually plays the dumb, loud idiot like Stifler in ""American Pie"" or Wheeler in ""Role Models."" Scott plays Doug where we sympathize with him, even if we do laugh at his nice guy attitude and his lack of general understanding for the situations he's in.<br/><br/>While ""Goon"" is very funny and has you engaged all along, the film will be released at a very interesting time. Much of the target audience for ""Goon"" is no doubt hockey fans, and the film is coming to them at a time when the subject isn't easily as laughable. With great players like Sidney Crosby suffering from concussion symptoms that threaten their careers and the ongoing long term results from many of these hits and fights we will see in ""Goon,"" the subject matter is not always as easy to find humor in.<br/><br/>The one thing that I kept being reminded of when watching Doug try to make the team and defend his teammates that he has only shortly come to know is the story of Derek Boogaard that appeared in the New York Times late last year. The life of an enforcer in hockey, one where they know they must be ready to put their bodies on the line at all times, is not an easy one; you fight, scratch, and claw; you break bones, bleed, and hurt. But you do it all for your teammates and to continue to do what you love: play hockey.<br/><br/>It is tough being reminded of the hard life of an enforcer in hockey, but ""Goon"" does make us chuckle and cheer for them. We must remember that the film was not made to mock or make fun of the life of an enforcer, but rather to glorify and praise their work. While we may not want to glorify the hits they give out and what their body goes through (as this has been a major issue in hockey recently), it is an essential part of the sport and a position that means so much to a team.<br/><br/>While hockey movies like ""Miracle"" and ""The Rocket"" tell stories of great moments and glory in hockey, films like ""Slap Shot"" and ""Goon"" remind us of the gritty side of the sport with a few laughs along the way. And while ""Goon"" struggles in its story telling and focus, the film succeeds in making us laugh and helps us cheer for the often forgotten hero in the hockey world. It is a funny story that celebrates the life of an enforcer without making light of the violence. In this period of time in the hockey world, it will be interesting to see how ""Goon"" makes true hockey fans feel. It may be made for some laughs (which will be found), but the film actually will hit home in a different way to fans, even as a comedy.<br/><br/>Read more reviews of Film, TV, and Games at CustodianFilmCritic.com"

To me Jay Baruchel, Alison Pill, Liev Schreiber and Kim Coates stood out.<br/><br/>The only other movie where I've seen and liked Seann William Scott was the Rundown. I thought he was charismatic punk then, but now I saw him as a human being, it was a quiet but quite deep performance. He made a sympathetic goon. I really felt for him in the ""I'm stupid, he's gay"" scene. For the record, I don't think he was stupid, just extremely shy and socially awkward, who internalized only too well his parents' labeling of him.

It is not a Cinderella story unless Cinderella discovers that she actually is good at cleaning floors, and that's her life's calling. Even the love story is beautifully low key. Things make sense in this movie the way the main character's life makes sense because it just does. AND that is why Blatt is incredibly heroic. <br/><br/>The pranks: one complaint I have about a lot of movies is that it they are simple stories wrapped around a couple of pranks, and we watch the pranks in the previews then go and see them in the theatre. In goon, there are pranks and one liners, but the characters deliver them as they would in real life... maybe its that the characters deliver them rather than the writer.<br/><br/>A kind of violent flick that is totally refreshing."

The story is simple but it is execution of the plot which makes it a compelling watch. The screenplay is written with conviction. Couple of scene do stand out- The scene where Doug gets hit by the ball in his face and fall flats on the ground not allowing opponents to hit the goal inspite of getting severely injured, the climax scene where Doug fights with Ross Rhea is the highlight of the film. The film however contains lot of bloodshed and abuses which unfortunately is required in the film ( generally shown in a Ice Hockey game). Sean William Scott completely surprises with his serious performance. The actor who is popular in comedy roles will surely been recognized for his performance as Doug Glatt. <br/><br/>GOON is hard-core violent bloody sport movie which is more of GUY's flick with some cool punching and boom-basting fight sequences.

"Hellmant","8","2","3","31 August 2012"," Inspirational and extremely violent hockey movie!
","'GOON': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>An inspirational and extremely violent hockey movie about a dim-witted outcast that finally finds his place in the world as a 'goon' for a semi-pro hockey team. The film was based on the book 'Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey' by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith. It's a biography based on Smith's successful career as a minor-league hockey 'enforcer' from 1988 to 1998. Sean William Scott stars as the character based on Smith in the film (Doug Glatt) and it was directed by Michael Dowse (who's previous directing credits include the headbangers comedy 'FUBAR' and the 80's themed comedy 'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT'). It was adapted for the screen by Jay Baruchel (who also co-stars in the film) and Evan Goldberg (who usually works with buddy Seth Rogen on such screenplays as 'SUPERBAD', 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'THE GREEN HORNET' and 'THE WATCH' but this time teamed with their mutual friend Goldberg instead). The movie is funny but more importantly it's a great inside look at the professional world of hockey! <br/><br/>As the film opens Doug Glatt (Scott) is a bouncer who's not happy with life and feels extremely undervalued by his family, especially his father who's a successful doctor (Eugene Levy). He idolizes legendary hockey goon Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) and spends most of his time hanging out with his hockey obsessed best friend, Pat (Baruchel), who hosts a commentary show on the sport. One day while the two are at a game a player climbs in to the stands attacking them (after being provoked by Pat) and calls them a homosexual slur. This upsets Doug, who has a gay brother, and he beats the crap out of him. His actions really impress the coach of his hometown hockey team (Nicholas Campbell) and he's asked to join the team as an enforcer. His success there leads to an invitation to join the Halifax Highlanders in Canada where he finally finds purpose and unity with his fellow teammates. He also attracts the attention of a girl (Alison Pill) for the first time and instantly falls for her.<br/><br/>Supposedly Doug Smith has been quoted as saying he's very happy with the film and it has been praised by hockey enthusiasts as an authentic look at the game, in all it's bloody glory. Baruchel and Goldberg's script is both witty and inspiring and Dowse's directing is sentimentally fitting. The film has a nice 80's feel to it (just like Dowse's 'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT', which was a pretty good film as well). All of the actors are more than adequate in their roles; Schreiber is especially memorable and Scott is about as likable as he's ever been. Some may see the tale as sort of a 'FORREST GUMP' style glorification of idiots but I think it's extremely touching and heartfelt. It's inspirational as well as extremely humorous and a grade A crowd pleaser all around.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ld28EwmjL8"

","Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott, the ""American Pie"" series) is a slow witted and big hearted kind of guy without much ambition. He toils away as a bouncer in a bar, and it's when he manhandles a player while watching a hockey game that a coach (Nicholas Campbell, 'Da Vinci's Inquest') realizes his great potential for being an ""enforcer"". Doug is taught just enough hockey skills to get by, and is sent to the Halifax Highlanders, where he's watched over by coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates, 'Sons of Anarchy') and is made to look out for star player Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin, ""C.R.A.Z.Y.""). A legendary tough guy of the game, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber, the ""Scream"" series) is soon to retire, and he sees Doug as the inheritor to his throne. And nice guy Doug falls in love with a young woman (Alison Pill, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") who has her own self-esteem issues.<br/><br/>""Goon"" is co-written and co-produced by supporting actor Jay Baruchel (""She's Out of My League"") as a comic and yet heartfelt celebration of the violent side of hockey, brought to vivid life with a lot of bloody brutality. Inspired by real-life player Doug Smith (you see footage of him during the end credits), it actually, genuinely cares about its characters, which is appreciated, and gives weight to the saga. It ultimately tells a very familiar misfit makes good formula, and while it may hold no surprises, it's suitably rousing just the same. Moreover, you can tell this was made by people who are actually big fans of the game, and they do get the ""feel"" just right.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the story thread regarding Doug as the black sheep of his family (both his dad (comedy legend Eugene Levy of 'SCTV' fame) and his brother are doctors) IS under-developed. Levy ends up with very little to do in the grand scheme of things. But some viewers may still enjoy how well paced the movie is and how well it cuts to the chase.<br/><br/>The whole cast is great, and they add to the good vibes. Scott, in particular, is a standout, showing that there's much more to him than Steve Stifler and Steve Stifler-type roles. Schreiber is amusing as his nemesis, Pill is appealing, and Baruchel is a real live wire as Dougs' best bud. Curt Keilback is quite funny as the announcer for the games.<br/><br/>While not exactly memorable in any way, ""Goon"" gets the blood pumping (and flowing) for a slick hour and a half. Michael Dowse (the ""FUBAR"" films, ""It's All Gone, Pete Tong"") directs, with engaging results.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"patricio-53898","10","1","1","13 June 2017"," Surprisingly great
","The great thing about Goon is that, when you get right down to it, it's not a sports movie. It's not even really about hockey in the sticks and skates sense of the word. Any fan of hockey can tell you, to great length, about the bizarre and unique position of the Goon, a player with minimal hockey skills, who is utilized solely to defend the more talented players, keep defenders from the opposing team honest, and beat the snot out of someone, should the need arise. It's a niche talent, yet an important one in terms of motivation, spirit, and tone of a hockey team. That's what this movie is about. It's about utilizing the gifts you were given, carving out a place in the world for you and your talents, and the basic human need to belong to something greater, a team, a romantic relationship, a family. The movie goes out of its way to tell you that protagonist Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt is NOT a hockey player. All Doug wants is to wear a uniform and use his talents to help the people he cares about, and I think we can all relate to that. <br/><br/>On a more technical note, the performances of the film are exceptional, particularly those of Seann William Scott, who gives the best performance of his career, for my money, as the simple, kind-hearted Glatt, and Liev Schreiber as another veteran Goon, Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea, looking to go out swinging. It also features hilarious performances from Jay Baruchel as the wisecracking best friend, and Kim Coates, Kim Coates-ing it up as the coach of Halifax. But what surprised me was how well the movie functions as both a comedy and a surprisingly sweet love story. <br/><br/>Long story short, don't let the title of this movie throw you off. Goon is an excellent film."
"Uriah43","6","1","1","22 May 2017"," A Potential Blockbuster Almost Ruined by Unnecessary Vulgarity
","Although he may not be the smartest person in the world, ""Doug Glatt"" (Seann William Scott) is a really nice guy with an incredible skill-he knows how to beat up people. And because of that he earns his living as a bouncer at a nightclub while the rest of his family looks down upon him. Then one day at a hockey game everything changes for him when one of the players decides to go into the stands to beat up his best friend ""Pat"" (Jay Baruchel). After easily beating the hockey player to a pulp Doug soon lands a job as a top-notch goon for the Halifax Highlanders with a mission to protect the best player on the team by the name of ""Xavier LaFlamme"" (Marc-André Grondin). Unfortunately, as Doug becomes more popular the spoiled LaFlamme becomes more jealous and insecure. To make matters even worse, the most dominant goon in hockey named ""Ross Rhea"" (Liev Schreiber) is soon to return from a 20-game suspension and has no interest in sharing his hard-earned reputation with any player from another team. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie had the potential of being a true blockbuster but it suffered from one serious flaw in that it had way too much vulgarity throughout the course of the film-and much of it was totally unnecessary. Of course, if this film was intended only for immature audiences then I could possibly understand some of the crass and sophomoric language. But it loses much of its appeal to viewers who are looking for something a bit more wholesome. Again, this film had some real potential. Unfortunately, the director (Michael Dowse) chose to take the low road and for that reason I have rated it a little lower as a result."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","1","1","7 June 2016"," Underrated Sports-Comedy With Good Writing and An Excellent Lead Performance
","Hockey is something that is just ingrained in Canadian culture. People from countries like Sweden, Finland, Russia and the Czech Republic get it too. Whether you play it or not, most of us still huddle around the T.V. when the Stanley Cup Playoffs or the Olympics come around. You crack open a couple of beers and watch the action with your friends. This isn't a movie about Canadian hockey but it feels like there is so much love for the sport radiating from it. This movie didn't get a big release but I sought it out anyway and I wasn't disappointed, you can enjoy this movie whether you like hockey or not.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a short introduction to the world of a hockey enforcer through Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) we then meet Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott) who is a bouncer at a bar. After seeing him deal with a couple of the bar patrons, a few things come across. He's not terribly bright, he can throw down with the best of them and he's generally a pretty sweet guy. The next day we get a glimpse of Doug's family after they are done at the synagogue. Dr. Glatt (Eugene Levy) is introducing his two sons Richard and Doug to some friends. We learn that Richard is gay and further proof that Doug is dumb. Dr. Glatt concludes the conversation by telling his friends that they're both adopted. Doug then goes to hang out with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel). Pat has a cable access show called Hot Ice about hockey. The big news is that Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea took an illegal shot at another player and is looking at a suspension. Doug tells Pat that he wants some purpose in his life and he wants something that he can call his own.<br/><br/>They go to see their hometown minor league hockey team The Assassins play. Doug and Pat are having a good time when one of the visiting players ends up in the penalty box. Pat starts cussing the guy out and he actually hops the glass and tries to attack Pat. He calls him a homophobic remark and Doug takes offence because of his gay brother. The guy punches Doug but Doug kicks the crap out of him. Doug then appears on Pat's show and after the guy who usually riles up Pat calls in, they actually get a call from the coach of the Assassins asking Doug if he wants to try out. He accepts the invitation and shows up the next day in figure skates (they belong to his brother). The other players start to make fun of him and he proceeds to take them out one by one. The coach tells him that he shouldn't beat up his teammates but offers him a spot on the team. When asked what number he wants his friend Pat tells him ""take the #69 it's hilarious!"" <br/><br/>Before I go on about the hilarious jokes or the well written characters, I want to point out this movie wouldn't work at all if they didn't have the great performance of Sean William Scott leading this film. Sean's big claim to fame is that he's Stifler from American Pie but you really see something else here. He can play a different type character and he infuses Doug with a lot of heart. He's his funny self but in a separate way and this movie wouldn't be successful without him. All the supporting actors are great minus Jay Baruchel who is laying it on a little too thick. He's a good actor, it's just a minor criticism from me. I really liked Liev Schreiber, he's pretty subtle here and he makes Ross a great antagonist to Doug. Alison Pill is also great and she plays a pretty funny character. Sean and Alison have good chemistry together and make what would be a throwaway subplot into something interesting. Marc-Andre Grondin is also good, I can't mention the whole supporting cast but I'd close with how good it was to see Eugene Levy and Kim Coates again, they are both memorable in their small but respective parts.<br/><br/>Moving on to the writing, you not only get more than your fair share of great jokes but you get some pretty well written characters. Ross would be a one-dimensional villain in any other movie but he's more like a future version of Doug. He's not evil, he's more disillusioned and cynical. He's had one job his entire career and he's just about done. He's looking for his shot at glory and Doug might just provide him that opportunity. Eva is a different kind of love interest. She describes herself as a terrible girlfriend and is turned on by the violence of hockey. She matches well with Doug's naive optimism. I also really liked the character of Doug himself. Sure he's dumb as a post but he really believes in using what he can do to help people. He wants to be a hockey player so bad even though everyone else just sees him as a thug in skates. Even if he is an idiot, you can identify with his sense of purpose and it's even inspiring in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie came out awhile ago but I revisit it a few times a year because I think it is that funny and it is that memorable. You get some really funny scenes, a great leading performance, a unique story and overall a memorable sports comedy when there are so few good ones being made today. I recommend it highly."

","This is where I confess to hating sports movies. I ended up watching the movie on the repeat urging of my boyfriend, convinced that I would dislike it.<br/><br/>I was wrong. So very, very wrong. I laughed all the way through the movie--loud, surprised guffaws and nerdy snort-laughs.<br/><br/>Without spoiling any plot details, the premise of the movie is not terribly exciting, but the combination of hilariously obscene writing, the spot-on delivery and solid acting, and the seeming ability of Sean Michael Scott to embody a truly lovable idiot sells a surprisingly likable and personable movie.<br/><br/>The movie also surprised me several times--sports movies have a tendency to focus on the rise of an underdog or fall of a hero. The themes are huge, and the focus of the film is on those themes.<br/><br/>This movie, by contrast, never forgets the importance of character and the need for the viewer to fall in love with characters in order to root for them. Thanks to the writing and acting, it is easy to fall in love with the characters, and to care deeply for them.<br/><br/>The movie also never forgets the small details of relationships and motivation that make characters believable. Really, it deserves a better rating than it has right now. Even if you can't stand sports movies, this one is worth checking out."
"Scarecrow-88","7","1","1","21 June 2013"," Goon
","Seann William Scott is actually--I can't believe I'm writing this--endearing (!) as a simple-minded bouncer who finds his happy place as a ""goon"" (the member of the team who beats the hell out of people and protects the star) on a struggling (this is being kind) hockey team trying to just win a game. The star of the team is the disgraced Xavier LaFlamme(Marc-André Grondin), so low that he spits on his team's logo out of disgust. Xavier shares a room with Scott's Doug Glatt, and he makes no bones that he doesn't like him. But because Doug harbors no ill will, has a big lug of a heart, and ingratiates himself to his team and Xavier, this dislike might just subside. The film's key story arc--besides Doug's budding romance with Eve (Alison Pill)--is the comparisons between Doug and soon-to-be-retiring thuggish warrior, Rhea (Liev Schrieber), both on teams fighting to get into the playoffs. Rhea has been celebrated as the tough, intimidating fighter with limited hockey skills but featuring a ruthless aggression that most hockey players care to avoid, with Doug considered his ""replacement"". Rhea knows that he must put Doug in his place, but he realizes that Platt isn't some self-absorbed, conceited showoff, but a true, dye-in-the-wool team player who puts his men above himself. Also Doug isn't the monster off the hockey rink he is on; in fact, Doug is a sweet-natured, mental-intellect-of-a-child, gentle soul who uses his fists and body to protect and win for his team, no matter how limited a capacity his skills might be. He becomes the heart and soul of his team while Xavier is clearly the gifted, talented hockey player needing that motivational shot-in-the-arm Doug provides just because of his team spirit. This is a brutal, fight-heavy, battered faces, bloodthirsty, exciting, fast-moving, no-guts-no-glory, profane, spirited hockey movie. It's kickass. If you like lots of scenes where Seann's face takes a licking, swells, with bruises and larges cuts, while he sends his opponents off the rink in stretchers (after bashing their faces in), then this is for you. Schrieber is an absolute badass as the taunting heckler who backs up his remarks to opposing teams by shutting faces by sending players into unconsciousness. His closing battle with Seann is visceral and thrilling. My favorite scene--Seann stops a puck from entering the goal with his face while a rival player comes down on his ankle with a skate blade (ouch!). Jay Baruchel has a sizable supporting part as Seann's potty-mouthed buddy, often recording the hockey games and making rather obscene comments that cause the parents of Glatt (including Eugene Levy, toning down his comedy for a rather serious part as a father who is concerned for his son's safety and career) to groan/frown."

","""Goon"" stars Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, a dimwitted bouncer who manages to make his way onto a local hockey team. His role? He's an enforcer, a violent position which requires him to get into bloody fist fights with opposing players. Offering respite from these scenes of violence is a hastily sketched romance between Doug and Eva, played by Alison Phill. She's a hockey fan who, like Doug, views herself as damaged goods.<br/><br/>Though the film's messages - ""don't be ashamed of who you are or what you do"", ""always love your teammates"" etc – are saccharine, ""Goon's"" overall tone is one of hyper-violence. Much of the film consists of Glatt being punched in the face or cracking skulls. Seann William Scott, so good in roles which require him to be an egotistical maverick, is given little to work with here. He's simple and childlike and not much fun, though this also makes the film somewhat interesting.<br/><br/>Some of ""Goon's"" skating scenes are well shot, but its original premise (a hockey movie about a hockey player who can't play hockey) quickly gives way to sports movie clichés. The film's swearing, which aims to be vulgarly funny, isn't inventive enough. Elsewhere director Michael Dowse lays on some heavy Christ symbolism. He think's he's making the next ""Raging Bull"".<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Starts well, goes nowhere. Worth one viewing."
"dohhook","9","1","1","19 November 2012"," The world needs more Goons like Doug Glatt
","Few and far between, we are occasionally given a film that rises into immortality, and takes its place in the lexicon of classic sports flicks. Goon is destined to be accepted among them. Goon is a film about a lovable bruiser Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott) who can't find much more viable employment or purpose other than being a bouncer at the local bar. Feeling alienated by his family and longing to find his ""thing"" in life, he turns to his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel, who also produces and co-wrote the script). Wanting to cheer Doug up, Pat takes him to a local hockey game for a night of corn dogs and mayhem. When things turn ugly and a player climbs into the stands to flatten foul and loud-mouthed Pat, Doug comes to the rescue and beats the pud out of the unsuspecting player. The crowd eats it up and the local coach is impressed to boot. A new light shines on Dougie, and he begins a journey on the path to his rightful place in life. Things don't come easy for Doug; he can hardly skate, and the teams he plays for are in disarray. But Doug knows he's good at one thing; being strong, and he doesn't take his calling lightly. Through Doug's can-do attitude and never-back-down to opposition mentality, the team starts finding it's rhythm and in return, Doug finds enlightenment, love and acceptance among his peers (although his parents aren't quite as understanding). What sets Goon apart from other sports flicks is that it feels authentic. Doug's character of an indestructible goon with a heart of gold brings the audience in as we laugh at his unfortunate anecdotes and wince at his undeserved pain. In the climax of the movie between good goon Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt and the league's bad goon Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (Liev Schreiber) the crowd stands on its feet in what is an unbelievable ""can this really be happening?"" sports moment. I found this to rank up there with some of the greatest sports moments in movie history (i.e. Rudy running out of the tunnel, etc.) My adrenaline was pumping and goosebumps were popping. What happens when an unstoppable force hits and immovable object? Check out this flick to find out. You shan't be disappointed."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","1","13 July 2012"," A foul (and true) showcase of hockey culture not seen since Slap Shot
","For the most part, hockey movies have been treated the same every other sports comedy or drama — with an underdog story and plenty of in-game footage. Enter ""Goon,"" a comedy that depicts the sport for all the guts and little of the glory. Not since ""Slap Shot"" has a hockey flick been this violent and verbally assaultive. <br/><br/>Sean William Scott stars as Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt, only Doug is anything but his new moniker. Big and meaty on the outside, Doug's a veritable teddy bear — soft-spoken and loyal. His fists, on the other hand, are considerably more audible. <br/><br/>After a D-league hockey player climbs out of the box to go after his friend, Ryan (Jay Baruchel), Doug knocks him out cold and catches the eye of the team's coach. Despite not being able to skate, the team brings him on as the enforcer, the guy sent out on the ice to rough other players up to retaliate for dirty hits.<br/><br/>In hockey, all teams bring in more aggressive players whose skills consist of picking fights, checking bodies into the boards and if they're lucky, causing problems in front of the net. ""Goon"" attempts to examine what being that kind of role player is all about, and it's not pretty.<br/><br/>With a screenplay from Baruchel and buddy Evan Goldberg who wrote ""Superbad"" and ""The Green Hornet"" with Seth Rogen (among other films), ""Goon"" is mainstream funny with an indie sensibility. When Doug signs a minor-league farm system contract with a team in Halifax, the cast of absurd characters triples as his new teammates are straight up degenerates. The crude humor that follows echoes the thankless, dirty, unfiltered nature of the sport, or at least the aspect that ""Goon"" wants to tap into.<br/><br/>""Goon"" starts to get a little aimless despite the improved humor once Doug and the Halifax Highlanders try and turn things around. His only motivation is to come into his own, as his family of Jewish doctors doesn't approve of his new career. He has a love interest named Eva (Alison Pill), a teammate who hates him named Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin) and then there's a veteran enforcer on the verge of retiring named Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) whom he appears destined to cross paths with by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Doug fancies the idea of being an actual hockey player, not a goon, and that seems to be the driving question of this chunk of the movie. LaFlamme was supposed to be the next big thing before Rhea knocked him out cold in a pro game, and the would-be super star has never been the same player (not to mentioned resorting to doing blow off of hookers' backs). Doug is headed in the opposite direction, so there's a conflict there, but it doesn't extend beyond the realm of the obvious fact that they need to work together.<br/><br/>Doug isn't exactly a flawed protagonist either, unless naiveté is a flaw. He's a saint compared to LaFlamme, and his entire relationship with Eva is about all of her problems because she has a boyfriend despite being really into sweet and innocent Doug. The two are adorable to watch, but their relationship has no bearing on the film and could've been cut entirely.<br/><br/>Schreiber knocks his part into the boards as Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea, a grislier, more hardened version of Doug, perhaps a future Doug should Doug take up Ross' attitude toward the game. Schreiber give us a quiet but confident Canadian with a matter-of-fact sense of humor, a real transformation for the actor (who did live in Canada but when he was younger than five years old).<br/><br/>Director Michael Dowse makes the best of the loud, dirty an hilarious script and the great talent that came with it, not glorifying the language or the violence but still showcasing it in such a way that it defines the tone of the film. His opening shot of a splash of blood hitting in the ice in slow-motion captures the inherent tradition, humor and somewhat despicable nature of violence in hockey.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

I really enjoyed the sportsmanship between the players as well showing what a real team is like and how they mixed different countries to come together. over all I give this movie an 8/10 for great acting, great directing, and the only spot it lost points was a cheap budget that left noticeable cutouts in the audience... that was a let down.."

","Goon <br/><br/>Playing hockey is the only time that a Canadian will knock someone over and not apologize.<br/><br/>And while the stick-handlers in this comedy aren't Canucks, don't expect much kindness from them either.<br/><br/>When Doug (Seann William Scott), a hardheaded bouncer from Boston, is caught on camera beating up a hockey player, who his friend (Jay Baruchel) was trash talking, he becomes an instant hit.<br/><br/>Offered the position of enforcer on his local team, Doug succeeds at pounding on the opposition when beckoned by his coach (Nicholas Campbell).<br/><br/>Soon enough he's called up to the minors to protect a fledging forward (Marc-André Grondin) who's been targeted by a veteran goon (Liev Schreiber).<br/><br/>Chockfull of hilarious hockey player stereotypes, this two-fisted underdog tale transcends comparisons to other hockey films, and shines solely on its own comedic merits.<br/><br/>Now, if they'd only shine a light on hockey's other unsung hero: the back-up goaltender.

"saadgkhan","7","1","1","28 May 2012"," Voilant, crud & high octane
","Goon – CATCH IT (B+) Goon is based upon the autobiography Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey by retired ice hockey enforcer Doug Smith. Goon is a high octane Canadian movie and it literally gives you an adrenaline rush. The gore, violence, crud humor and scary ice hockey is screaming for it to be an ultimate boys flick. Sean William Scott as outcast innocent yet crazy headed bouncer becomes ice hockey enforcer is great. He really buffed up and seemed like work really hard to keep him it undertone. French/Canadian actor Marc-André Grondin is simply superb. His hot headed jerk performance makes me watch his previous French movies. Jay Baruchel is same obnoxious. Alison Pill is sweet. Liev Schreiber is great as enforcer though he doesn't have much screen time but he does his part well. Overall, Goon is a great sports movie with lots of fights, violence, crud behaviors and everything a manly sports movie should have. I loved it!"
"wandereramor","7","1","1","25 May 2012"," Alternate title: Future Brain Damage Cases of Canada
","The hero of Goon is a kid who's a bit dumb and a bit crass but has a good heart. He plays a pretty ignominious position, that of the goon -- the hockey player who isn't really too good at hockey but is really good at fighting with people. It's a vulgar role, but he takes it seriously. And that kind of describes the movie as well. It's dumb and a bit puerile, but warm-hearted, usually funny (including some laugh-out-loud lines), and charming in how accepting it is of dingy minutia like minor-league hockey.<br/><br/>One could fault it for lack of ambition: the film comes and goes without leaving much of an impression, but that's also a part of its charm. Even at being a lazy Saturday night comedy it doesn't wholly succeed -- characters like the protagonist's gay brother and his mercurial love interest never really justify their screen time, mainly because of how spastically Goon jumps between plot threads. But it's a pleasant enough experience that would go down well with a couple of beers, and that's really all you can ask for."
"florescochris10","10","1","1","25 March 2012"," A good laugh!
","This movie doesn't portray minor league hockey or hockey realistically but does show you the tough side of hockey very well. The plot of the movie is slow at the beginning and Jay's character is one to forget as he is highly annoying but once it starts to get in depth to Sean's character Doug then it starts to get interesting. Saw it the opening weekend it came out in Canada and thought it was a well done movie. Being from Manitoba and having the movie filmed here made me want to see it even more. Glad I went overall if you don't laugh your not human or 90 years old. My favourite scene was Doug(Sean) with his family in the restaurant. My favourite characters the two Russians lol and please go support a good hockey movie. That is all I want to say, enjoy everyone!"
"andrecue2000","8","4","9","26 February 2012"," Excellent little movie - 6 thumbs up!
","I went to see this film with two buddies and we are unanimous in our view that Goon is a thoroughly enjoyable, well crafted little movie. The script is sharp and witty. The lead and especially the secondary characters are all superb. Baruchel is hilarious. Expect more great things from this young man. The hockey sequences are very believable. Just as important, the fight scenes are spot-on ... Gnarly, rough and stupid, just like real small town hockey fights. Seann William Scott is very charming and his performance is note-perfect as the dumb but lovable goon. The music is also great. I have to tip my hat to whomever decided to select Pagliaro's ""Rain Showers"" for one of the scenes. Brilliant. By the way, it's perhaps not going to be seen as great a film as ""Slapshot"", but ""Goon"" is infinitely more satisfying. Six thumbs up!"
"cajviener","9","3","6","2 March 2012"," Interesting and realistic in some ways
","If you play or played hockey before, this movie is enjoyable and realistic in some ways. Goon shows realistic elements such as how teams work together and each player has a role. There is a lot of fighting, reminiscent of hockey in the early 1990s. The script is bad but the direction and actors' tone and emotion portrayed is strong and semi-realistic. This is supposed to be a comedy but is in fact more like real life with several out-sized elements. Like a drama set in the world it takes place in, men playing a child's game for money, risking real life consequences, and facing trade-offs to keep their place in that world with no back up plans to speak of. So how is that funny? Pluses are that the subject was hockey, goons are shown respect, the team works together and that is shown as a positive. Minuses to fake sounding conversations and Jay Baruchels character, whose lines are needlessly distracting and border on blatant scene stealing. Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt and Liev Schrieber as Rhea both did a great job, as does the Halifax coach, the Laflamme character and the girlfriend. The use of profanity has been discussed as being realistic to the game...yes and no. The profanity in the movie is played for laughs and if you are over 25 you have probably already had enough of that. The film takes place at least 15 years ahead of Slap Shot in real hockey time, and is set in the present in terms of equipment and technology. The players were not very aggressive for pros, and except for the goons and Laflamme they were portrayed as unfocused losers. This is jarring in contrast to the team as a whole being portrayed as close to making the playoffs, which does not seem possible with those players. Even looking at these negatives, the positives are strong and this is a must see movie if you like hockey. Go see it."

","I'm a hearing impaired and I enjoy many comedy movies, based on true story movies, and I like Seann William Scott. I enjoy his movies that he has been in (the American Pie series). I think he is hilarious and I enjoy watching movies that he is in. I was at redbox and I saw that Goon was out and saw that Seann was in it and I was excited to watch it. I put the movie in and eager to start it. Looking for the closed caption and I don't see anything for hearing impaired. The director/creator of this movie FORGOT to include CLOSED CAPTION for the hearing impaired. I cannot begin to tell you how much this makes me furious. First of all, it is UNFAIR to hearing impaired who enjoy movies as much as anyone else does. That movie had captions for Spanish but forgotten about hearing impaired. Any movie that forgets to include closed caption makes me furious and I lose all respect for whoever directed it or created it. It is very important to make sure it has CLOSED CAPTION for the hearing impaired as well as for Spanish if you are going to sell this movie in the US or in the NORTH America. I have no respect for you Michael Dowse or whoever holds the responsible for putting CLOSED CAPTION for the hearing impaired. Oh not to mention that at the redbox screen description for the movie, it said that it had CC meaning it had CLOSED CAPTION. Isn't that a lie? How is that right? Someone need to fix that crap."
"gsfsu","1","6","17","13 April 2012"," Utterly Worthless In Every Respect
","I love the game of hockey and perhaps that is one big reason I saw a complete lack of anything positive in this movie. Whereas ""Slap Shot"" told the story of minor league hockey (admittedly with some over-the-top humor) and ""Youngblood"" the story of a hockey player who wanted a shot at the big time, ""Goon"" tells neither a story nor illustrates it in anything but vulgar, obscene clichés. ""Goon"" is an insult to movie-making and the sport of hockey. Even the game scenes are poorly done and unbelievable (such as the player telling the on-ice officials not to interfere with a fight).<br/><br/>Not much of this movie makes sense. Someone not familiar with Canada or hockey would walk away thinking Canadians are vulgar, bloodthirsty cretins whose only interest is watching WWE-type brawls on ice when they are not replacing their native language with the worst foul-mouthed cussing I've ever heard on screen - virtually all of it unnecessary.<br/><br/>If the intent of the movie-maker was to tell the story of a hockey goon, and there are such people, he fell incredibility short. If it was to tell some sort of love story (the goon falls in love of course) that goes by the wayside as well.<br/><br/>I couldn't find a single thing in this stinking morass of a movie to like. It is crap like this that gives the sport of hockey a black eye."

This type of hockey that is played is basically what an enforcer in the game does, granted it's not as bad in the bigger leagues like the NHL or KHL, but it is what it's like in the lower lower leagues, it's a film that shouldn't be taken so seriously, i mean in part of the film for example they give laflamme a 5min penalty for high sticking yet the announce as a double minor, any hockey fan knows a double minor is a 2+2, if you're getting 5mins for high sticking, that's normally a game penalty."

The goon's best friend is one of those guys who tries way too hard and one would wish he just would shut up! The guy you hate sitting beside in a restaurant, and character you wished they omitted from the movie. However, there were some funny scenes. The hockey part was excellent. One sees the pressures on the players and what is expected from the hockey profession. How everyone on the team plays his part, and the goon creates the open ice for the star player. Liev Schrieber plays the best character in the movie as the rival goon, who throws the other team off their game. The movie is filmed in my hometown of Winnipeg and I noticed many sites like the MTS centre, the exchange district, and Keleckies. I give the film six out of ten."

It's a nice & simple movie about a ""loser"" that gets a chance to play hockey and how everything plays out for him. I definitely recommend it for anyone who loves hockey and for anyone who wants to enjoy a few mindless chuckles at home with popcorn, or while prepping your hockey equipment for the next game :D<br/><br/>PS - Kinda surprised at a few of the rants here against this movie...

"eric262003","6","0","0","16 May 2020"," Pays Homage To The Enforcers of Hockey.
","In hockey, we have the forwards which are the centres and the wingers who's main purpose is to score as many goals as possible. Then you have the defense who literally have to have eyes in the back of their heads because they're there to assist the forwards in scoring the goals and to prevent the forwards from the rival teams from getting closer to the goalie in their efforts to score a goal. Then you have the goaltender who's there to guard the net. And if the goalie lets too many goals in, you're guaranteed a bad day.<br/><br/>Then you have the most overlooked members of a hockey team. They are the enforcers, the added muscle to the rough sport that is hockey and you ask yourselves what is their function on a hockey team besides muscle and publicity both good or bad? The answer to that is they're the protectors of the other players and are there to fight with the other muscles on the opposing teams. Such well-notable enforcers or as they're often referred to as ""goons"" include Bob Probert, Marty McSorley, Tie Domi, Chris Nilan and Zdeno Chara. They were not known for their skills as players who can skate, score goals or were that defensive. They just got on took down rivals and sat in the penalty box. Sure there were some exceptional goons who were capable at scoring goals like Rick Tocchet, Cam Neely, Jerome Iginla even Mario Lemieux and Rocket Richard, most goons weren't well skilled at hockey, but can depend on muscle to carry their teams forward.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons I genuinely enjoyed the movie ""Goon"" because it pays homage to the artistry of being an enforcer who in the past gets dismissed as being talent-deprived thugs just on to fight with members of the opposing team. to bring down the competition so that their team has an upper advantage for the win. Seann William Scott stars as Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt, a bouncer who gets hired on the spot to be an enforcer for a minor league hockey team in Massachusetts. One of the qualities that make ""Goon"" stand out is that Doug might be good at beating people up, that doesn't really necessarily make him toxic let alone a bully. In fact he could very be a thug with heart of gold. And even though he comes from a well-defined family of academics, he's the black sheep being that he's anything but academic. And though his family still believes he has potential, Doug tells them off he's not. Not that he's being modest, he just knows who he is and is not ashamed to admit he's dumb and that him wearing a hockey uniform and being hired to hurt players he has found his true calling.<br/><br/>And sure the film might be saturated with a cornucopia of violent scenes that through every crunch, snap, crackle and pop everything looks and feels authentic, the movie itself isn't just dependent on its hardcore styled violent scenes. 'Goon"" is also played from the heart as we have very well fleshed out characters and that the human interest elements are something fans who are into watching character-driven movies something that could be invested in. There is no team movie about who's winning or losing or about an underdog team pulling all the stops at the last minute to conquer the championship. It's about a rags-to-riches story of Doug's rise to fame a carving a life on his own.<br/><br/>One day he watches a hockey game with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel), who takes the pleasure of calling out rival hockey teams and belittling them. One player, not amused by Pat's obnoxious ways makes his way over to them and threatens to annihilate Pat. But Doug intervenes and clobbers the player going so far as to split open his helmet. Some scout take notes and then next thing you know, Doug has now become a hockey player. Though he wasn't born to skate, he's not on for that reason, he's there to take down rival teammates who pose a threat to his team.<br/><br/>The character side of this story steams from Doug's privileged lifestyle. He's frequently pressured by his parents (Eugene Levy and Ellen David) that he has so much potential. Being that his father and brother Ira (David Paetkau) are both doctors, Doug understands that he will never excel to their levels of success and that his new role in professional hockey is a dream he never saw coming.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber was an unexpected surprise to play a supporting role as the rival goon Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea. Rhea was once admired by Doug, but now that they're on opposing teams, we all know that sooner than later they will likely have a showdown in the end. Sure we are aware that the most contagious thing about hockey like other sports is that concussions have been greatly observed and deeply concerned by players, coaches, physicians and the higher-ups in sports organizations, here in ""Goon"" we look at a different era in hockey before it became more watered down than it is today.<br/><br/>Doug eventually befriends a player named Xavier LaFlemme (Marc-Andre Grondin) a star player who's getting on in age who serves as his protector from other goons. It feels as if the restrictions of violence in this era was catatonic. It would appear that Doug's position would be that he'd spend a portion of his time in the penalty box. The brutality depicted here through the roof.<br/><br/>The movie does have some nice subtle romantic comedy touches that concentrate on Doug and his relationship with the promiscuous Eva (Alison Pill) who admits she's attracted to big, sweaty hockey players who's bruises and blood are sexier than their tattoos. Pill's comic relief compliments perfectly as she's the manipulator behind the naive nature of Doug's lovable characteristics.<br/><br/>To debunk the negative stereotypes that enforcers are all muscles and no brains is a total misnomer. Take for example George Parros who plays nine seasons in the NHL in many different teams before retiring as a Montreal Canadien in 2014. He was as strong as an ox, but he was far from being as dumb as one. He was educated at Princeton University where he majored in economics with 3.18 GPA and scored 1250 on his SATs. That counteracts the big dumb jock analogy to the max.<br/><br/>It should be noted that ""Goon"" was based off of the non-fiction memoirs titled ""Goon: The True Story of the Unlikely Journey Into Minor League Hockey"" by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith. The real Doug Smith played 10 years in Minor League hockey on various teams from 1988-1998 and has done other lines of profession including a police officer, an author, and a coach in high school and Minor League Hockey association."

","Very solid.<br/><br/>'Goon' makes for a decent sports comedy. It actually keeps good focus on the sporting stuff involved, even if it isn't an important thing in the grand scheme of the film. It's definitely comedy-centric, but it has a bit more to it than what is usual for this genre.<br/><br/>Seann William Scott leads as Doug, a surprisingly nice individual despite the obvious nature of his other antics - you find yourself rooting for him. The rest of the cast aren't anything to write home about, but that's not a big deal as it's just a film to have a laugh with and not take too seriously.<br/><br/>Not sure where they go for the sequel, hopefully it avoids the dreaded 'sequelitis'."

","A down-and-out bouncer discovers he has a talent for dolling out beatings in the hockey rink in Goon (2011), a surprising independent Canadian sports comedy film written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg and directed by Michael Dowse. Aside from being well made, Goon features a solid, nuanced performance by Seann William Scott.<br/><br/>Despite dismal box office returns, Goon is almost universally praised by critics. It currently has a rating of 82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I overlooked it many times, because although Seann William Scott has had funny side roles in some of my favorite comedies, I just couldn't imagine him as a leading man. I was so wrong. In Goon, Scott proves he is a competent actor capable of breaking out of the fratbro trope.<br/><br/>Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a tough but polite simpleton, is working a dead end job as a bouncer. His friend, Pat (Jay Baruchel), hosts a public access hockey call-in show. One night at an Orangetown Assassins minor league game, Doug gets into a fight with a player and the Assassins coach invites him to join the team as their ""enforcer."" When his skills on the ice improve, he's recruited to play for the Halifax Highlanders and protect their star player, Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-André Grondin), who is slow to recover from a brutal knockdown.<br/><br/>Along the way, he falls in love with Eva (Alison Pill), an adorkable hockey fan who sleeps around with hockey players, but is in a relationship, and discovers he might one day have to confront Ross ""the Boss"" Rhea (Liev Schreiber), who was responsible for knocking out Xavier LaFlamme. Will he get the girl and defeat his rival? <br/><br/>Seann William Scott is an American actor predominantly known for playing Steve Stifler in the American Pie films, as well as a host of other moronic, comic-relief roles. His portrayal of Doug in Goon reveals a nuanced side and shows he is maturing as an actor. I was impressed by this performance, and like Matthew McConaughey, who began his career as a stoner ""bro"", as Scott gets older he may successfully transition to more dramatic roles.<br/><br/>Alison Pill is a Canadian actress who played Kim Pine in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) and Maggie Jordan in the TV series The Newsroom (2012-2014), though she has been acting since childhood. Alison's character, Eva, is a subverted version of Adrian from Rocky. As Doug's love interest, Eva is not well-developed, which is a shame because even though their relationship is given plenty of screen time, she tends to fade into the background. We never learn much about her other than her passion for hockey and unfaithful promiscuity.<br/><br/>Goon doesn't disguise its similarities with Rocky (1976), another film about a dimwitted but polite muscle who rises to prominence in a violent sport. Goon raises the violence in hockey to a level in which you almost forget the point of the game is to score goals. It focuses almost entirely on Doug's bouts with the other players, and the exaggerated level of brutality would be gratuitous if it wasn't so well-crafted.<br/><br/>Goon shares similarities with other films as well. A scene in which Doug Glatt meets Ross Rhea in a diner is reminiscent of the famous restaurant scene in Heat (1995). These callbacks to famous films is probably why Goon is so good, since the filmmakers decided to replicate proved success. Unfortunately, either the subject matter doesn't really appeal to American audiences or the film wasn't properly advertised, and it was not commercially successful. A sequel, Goon: Last of the Enforcers, came out this year to mediocre reception."

","Recruited by an ice hockey team, a bouncer discovers that the game is less about scoring goals and more about bashing the life out of his opponents in this sports comedy from Canada. Seann William Scott provides an earnest turn as the protagonist who has no interest in violence beyond defending others and there is a sweet romantic subplot further humanises him. The film is undermined though by focusing on all the fights that Scott gets into on the ice as opposed to the hockey games. All that ice hockey here seems to involve for Canadians is players clashing into one another and beating each other to pulp -- basically, boxing on ice -- and as someone unfamiliar with the sport, it is baffling how all the fights are championed by referees and considered part of the game. If anything like what occurs here happened in a soccer game, it would be an instant red/yellow card! Put more simply, one's mileage with the film may vary depending on one's familiarity with Canadian ice hockey; for a layman though, this is basically just a film about gory fights on ice. It is not particularly funny either with a gay brother and conservative, adoptive Jewish parents coming off as quirky for the sake of it. Sure, the film has some heart with Scott's gradual rise to fame and desire to be considered a real hockey player when he can barely skate, but this is a hard film to recommend to non-ice hockey fans."

","With the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs getting under way this week (of 4/10/16), I thought it would be fun to dip into the archives for my review of the 2011 dramedy hockey flick ""Goon"".<br/><br/>Right off the bat (or ""stick"" in the case of this hockey comedy/drama) I thought that ""Goon"" was going to be really stupid and that I'd made a big mistake in ordering the DVD. But I decided to give it a chance. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>This is a flick that could have been a silly and over-the-top throwaway. But thankfully the film makers together with a commendable cast took the story in a whole different direction. And they wound up with a fresh and engaging take on friendship, love and loyalty.<br/><br/>Seann William Scott is blissfully ignorant as a man/child with the capacity to become a fearsome enforcer. His character says those bluntly candid things we all would like to if we didn't have a filter. Alison Pill is his too-cute-to-take girlfriend who falls helplessly for the big guy's honestly innocent charm. The seemingly ever-under appreciated Liev Schreiber delivers a memorable turn as an aging hockey thug giving it one last roundhouse swing as he rides the downhill slide to the end of a black-and-blue career. And Jay Baruchel is just flat-out funny and whacked-out as hell as Scott's best friend.<br/><br/>Be cautioned, however. The violence is jarring and brutal. But, hey, no one ever confused Pro Hockey with playing patty-cake.<br/><br/>This one could have been mindless. The good news is that it not only has a brain, but a big ol' heart to go along with it."

","If you have a weak spot for ice hockey and the fights that come usual with that sport then you probably will like this movie. I am one of those people so I did like the movie. It made me think a little bit of the old time ice hockey movie classic Slap Shot. Since Goon is based on a true story it's even better to me. There is not that much to laugh with, and it doesn't matter to me, but there is for sure a lot of fighting. The story itself is very easy and pleasant to follow, even for people that are not really into ice hockey. The actors play their respective characters at their best.

","I'm not usually one for sports movies. In fact I think I can count on one hand the ones I actually, really enjoyed. Goon, however, which skates miles ahead of all the others, is my favorite sports movie ever made, and one of my top comedies, period. It's written, acted and conveyed to its audience with such rowdy enthusiasm and earnest, lifelike character interaction that simply demands classic status. It's a film about hockey, but it's also not. It's mainly a film about dudes kicking the absolute ever loving crap out of each other, in some really impressive ice rink gladiatorial smackdowns to rival anything in Gladiator itself. It concerns players who are drafted based on their brute force alone, to distract, demolish and destroy their opposing team members, leaving the ice clear for the faster, more skilled players to go score a ton of goals. One such 'goon' is Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott), a big lovable dunce with a peanut brain, kind heart and the sheer force of a juggernaut hurricane when on the ice. Scott ditches the Stiffler shtick for a quieter brand of silliness, and he's never been better. When his brutal tactics are witnessed by small time coach '' Hortense (Nicholas Campbell, loopy perfection), he's sent to the farm leagues under the snarky rule of his brother, Coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates). Saskatoon native Coates doesn't seem to know how to not steal any scene he's ever been in, and he's side-splitting here, a tornado of cynical, hopped up rage and pissy energy. His drunken speech is a highlight. Glatt soon meets his team, including spoiled golden boy prodigy turned relentless coke head Laflamme (Marc Andre Godin) skeevy Russian brothers Evgeny and Oleg, and hilarious Canadian whackjob Belchier (Jonathan Cherry). They're a pissss poor motley crew of morons, and they're losing their season spectacularly. Glatt's sweet disposition, blind optimism and invincible uppercuts soon turn things around for the better, though, until he meets his nemesis, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) another legendary thug with bone crunching plans for Doug. Schreiber is priceless, sporting a handlebar 'stache you could rope swing from, and a demented Canadian accent eh, clearly having the most fun in his career so far. Jay Baruchel shows up as Doug's crude DJ buddy, Alison Pill as Doug's slutty love interest, and Eugene Levy as his unappreciative father. The scenes of ice bound action are crisply filmed, the fight scenes exploding in triumphantly bloody standoffs of R rated glory. The humour comes hard and fast from a whip smart script that's faster than the puck, sharper than the skates and funnier than any other sports themed flick I've seen before."

It's really inspiring how much blood and determination Doug puts out on the field when he is playing.<br/><br/>The romantic relationship between Doug and Eva felt really unnecessary, I feel like that was the low point of the movie.

"jenseeli","8","0","0","12 April 2015"," Brutal but sweet, how can that be?
","I watched this film because I like hockey and I heard it was a good story. Both points turned out to be true. However, the fight scenes are a little too gory for me: lots of blood and teeth and sound effects. Also the characters are just as crude and foul-mouthed as the stereotype. Hardly a line of dialog without an f word and a reference to penises, gays, and/or sex. If you know what you're getting into, then you may be able to see the really sweet story of Doug Glatt and his team, the Halifax Highlanders.<br/><br/>So, Doug is not too bright, but he has firm ideas of the right thing to do. He is working as a bouncer in a bar when the film opens, hanging out with his best friend who has a sort of amateur hockey talk show. One night at a local team's game, an opposing team's player climbs into the crowd to fight with Doug's friend and Doug knocks him around. The coach of the local team invites him to join the team, to be a goon and protect the other players. Doug can't even skate, but he wants to belong. It isn't long before he gets sent up to Halifax to play in a Canadian league and that's where most of the story takes place. <br/><br/>Doug's teammates are the usual band of misfits: the alcoholic old dog who is going through a divorce, the young earnest but not very good guy, the phenom who was injured in a NHl game and is trying to get his groove back, etc. They don't know how to be a team and they are terrible on the ice. It takes the open-hearted honesty of Doug the Thug to mold them into winners. And some fights, of course. By the way, there is also a love- interest in Eva. I'm not convinced she adds anything to the story but the scenes between Doug and Eva are mostly cute. ""You make me want to stop sleeping with lots of guys"" is not a great line, but it kind of works."
"joncheskin","7","0","0","18 February 2015"," Entertaining Homage to Hockey Goons
","For those of you looking for a high-class, well-nuanced dramatic presentation, Goon is probably not for you. However, it is very funny and has a lot of heart in unexpected places, so is well worth a view for someone who likes sports movies and (extremely) vulgar comedy.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Doug, a bouncer at an Ontario bar who one day beats up a hockey player at a minor league game who crawls into the stands to take out a fan. The performance is noticed by the home hockey coach, who invites him to a tryout. Doug can't even skate, but he is the toughest son-of-a-gun on the planet and is soon hired by the team to take out enemy goons. The movie traces Doug's remarkable and extremely tacky career as a hockey enforcer, up to a showdown with a famous bully from a rival team.<br/><br/>This movie inevitably draws comparisons to Slap Shot, to which it is clearly indebted, but actually has a different slant than its predecessor. Slap Shot was an homage to teams like the 70s Flyers, who played a new rough and tumble style but whose players were still hockey players. Goon, by contrast, pays homage to a phenomenon of the 80s and 90s, single players hired by teams specifically to fight and do little else. Guys like Bob Probert, Chris Nilan, Derek Boogarde and others could barely play hockey, but made a very tough living being the body-guards of the skill players. Doug from Goon clearly plays that role.<br/><br/>The movie gets a lot of comedic mileage out of the fact that these goons have no talent in the conventional sense; Doug is neither smart nor skilled, and we laugh at him because he is clear mockery of any sort of sporting ideal. Beyond that, he occupies a world that is so tacky that it is simply hilarious; the movie is at its best when it lovingly makes fun of the amazingly vulgar world of the minor-league hockey player. Doug is very sympathetic, however, because he is tough as nails and willing to take a nasty one for his teammate, and in the end it is this quality that ends up turning the tide for his team. We root for him because he is the type of person we like to be--a tough but ultimately kind-hearted lug who overcomes the odds by determination. At the same time the movie avoids the trap of taking itself seriously, and in the end gives us some good not-particularly-clean fun."

In this movie we watch Doug develop as a character and we learn a lot about his teammates and the other characters in this movie. This movie reminds me of the hockey movie Youngblood from the 1980s but except this movie tells the story of a goon and not just a hockey player. It is very interesting with a movie just about a goon because we get to experience many different fighting scenes and we see how Doug is not just a fighter but he is also a very nice guy."

","I'm not much of a sports fan, but I do enjoy the good occasional sports film or documentary, whether it's about football, baseball, snowboarding or hockey.<br/><br/>And this is a great sports film --if you're not turned off by excessive amounts of violence, profanity and generally vulgar language.<br/><br/>Pardon the crass review summary, but there are indeed a lot of parallels between this film and Forrest Gump:<br/><br/><ul><li>Seann William Scott plays Doug Glatt: a quiet and somewhat innocent protagonist who's not the brightest bulb in the box (especially compared to his physician father and brother) but demonstrates great heart and is endlessly sweet and endearing. His sweetness and generally meek and naive demeanor contrast starkly with the physical prowess he demonstrates as a bar bouncer/back alley enforcer.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Our simple-minded hero is dragged out of his dreary, mediocre existence by a chance but dramatic demonstration of his physical talent: a superhumanly thick skull and ability to knock guys out cold without breaking a sweat. He's quickly recruited by a local hockey team and sets off on his athletic adventure.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Doug falls head over heels for a flighty bad girl who has some emotional issues tied to self-destructive sexual promiscuity. She wants him but keeps pushing him away and alternating hot and cold because she knows she's bad for him. Yet our romantically naive hero never wavers in his adoration for this troubled hockey groupie.</li></ul><br/><br/>OK, so it's not an exact point-for-point matchup with the multi-Academy-Award-winning 1994 classic. But Goon does have a lot of heart and will surprise those who give it a chance.<br/><br/>Obviously, being written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg (frequent collaborator with Seth Rogen), Goon is of a different ilk from more ""serious"" dramedies like Forrest Gump. This film features the same style of man-child pothead humor that has done so well in films like Pineapple Express, Superbad and This is the End. There are tons of memorable lines and gut-busting scenes that keep the energy level of the film high without encroaching on the plot or drama.<br/><br/>For a short dramedy that emphasizes the comedy, there's a fair amount of character development as we see Doug grow into his role on the team, discovering what it means to be a ""goon"" while also helping his girlfriend, Eva, and teammate, Xavier, get over their respective issues.<br/><br/>And really that's all the character development you need in a satisfying and life-affirming sports comedy. The main character doesn't need to experience a personal catharsis or undergo a sweeping character arc to touch the audience. And the hilarious supporting characters in the film (notables include the goalie, the best friend, and the Russian brothers) don't need to change in order to deliver compelling and thoroughly entertaining performances that sell the camaraderie between friends and teammates or create a convincing portrayal of hockey culture.<br/><br/>This is a very well cast and directed film in which pretty much every character works and adds their own contribution to the movie. Even the more minor roles, like the sportscasters, the donair restaurant owner, Ricky Mabe's character, etc. tie in so well to the feel of the movie and the comedic effect of each scene.<br/><br/>Schreiber also delivers an excellent portrayal of the ""bad"" goon and makes for an excellent antagonist/rival in a genre that often has very cheesy, hammed up ""villains."" Instead, Ross ""the Boss"" Rhea is shown as a tragic anti-villain who receives the audience's sympathy as much as he gains their antipathy for brutalizing the protagonists.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just a great feel-good sports film with lots of lewd language and hilarious characters. There's certainly drama as you watch the protagonist struggle against the odds in the rink and struggle with life and relationships on and off the ice. But it never gets too heavy and keeps you gripped with its abundant humor and action."

","I'm not a hockey fan by any stretch of the imagination, but Goon is a really funny, heart-warming film despite the film being hockey-based. But then again, this is a Canadian movie so a hockey film from Canada is not surprising at all. But the film goes beyond the sport and into the realm of its characters. The film is mostly based off the characters and their relationships with each other. Making friendships and finding love are some common themes here. However, the entertainment level is on full gear as we get some very brutal fights and lots of blood. The film is extremely violent, which may be a turn-off for some people expecting a film like 2004's Miracle.<br/><br/>Michael Dowse's film is about a man named Doug Glatt who heralds from an educated family and works as a bouncer at a bar, even though he seems dim-witted to a degree. But at a hockey game, he protects his best friend from a vicious hockey player by knocking him out cold which opens the eyes of the scouts. Despite disapproval from his parents, Doug gets a chance to shine as a enforcer for a minor league hockey team....and one of his rivals is a washed-up enforcer named Ross Rhea.<br/><br/>The acting is actually pretty good. Seann William Scott is known for his role as Stifler in the American Pie series, but he does an excellent job playing the complete opposite as the nice, but really dumb Doug. Jay Baruchel is okay as Doug's friend, but maybe tone down his language a bit. Liev Schreiber does a fine job as Rhea. Eugene Levy makes a cameo as Doug's father.<br/><br/>Overall, Goon turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It's much more than a sports film as it centers on a rags-to-rich story, which makes it all the better because of Doug's personality. There is enough blood and brawls to satisfy hockey fans or any sports fan in general. I'm not a hockey guy, but I was able to enjoy the film very much so because I pretty much saw the brawls as boxing on ice. It's a good, entertaining film. I rate this film 9/10."

I think he was perfect for the role of Doug Glatt and his acting looked effortless.<br/><br/>As a hockey fan, this was a really fun movie to watch, even if some of the plays couldn't actually happen in real life.

I liked the different personalities of the players and the way that they did (or didn't) get along.

It's when Doug and Eva just get together and what could have been a run-of-the-mill, shove-it-in-the-movie-because- why-not sex scene is actually a very sweet scene between Scott and Allison Pill.

It is a simple story with generic sports drama elements only that it is not a normal sport and our protagonist is not a conventional sports person.

","While the movie ""Slap Shot"" was about a hockey team trying to be goons in order to gain popularity. This movie is about a likable goon played by Seann William Scott. Now Seann William Scott is well known for playing one of those obnoxious characters that think with the dick instead of the brain all the time. In fact Ryan played by Jay Baruchel is the obnoxious character in this movie. But while the protagonist Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt(Seann William Scott) might be a character that throws down when he has to but he is a very likable guy without being obnoxious. He is pretty much a nice guy that tries to stand up for whats right but when on the ice he can take a punch and dish out punishment. Glatt starts out as a bouncer and basically becomes a bodyguard on ice, this isn't necessarily a hockey movie. Cause it focuses more on the goons of hockey instead of legit hockey players. But the goon side of things is just so much fun to watch, especially how the blending of humor works with the violence on ice. Liev Schreiber is in this as Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea. I thought he would either be the villain on the other team or a rival to Glatt. But it works more in the manner of two opponents on different teams that have mutual respect for each other going at it with each other with all they got. Although it's mostly near the end with the showdown with these two character. Who are basically portrayals of a hockey goon legends Tiger Williams and Doug Smith or Terry O'Reilly. There is also a love interest part of this movie that doesn't really go anywhere much but adds slightly more to the humor I guess. The only legit hockey player in this seems to be Xavier Laflamme(Marc-Andre Grondin) who is traumatized in the movie from getting owned by Ross. The flaw of this movie though is that it doesn't have much of a development. Just 3 characters are somewhat memorable, like the Asian guy on the team. It would have stood out if he used his calculating skills on ice and other players on the team did something unique on ice that made them stand out. But pretty much none of the characters on the main team stands out. But when it comes down to it almost none of the characters are really fleshed out. Also the development of the story just seem a bit too quickly paced with not enough good development. Despite few flaws this is a movie worth watching, I can't really say hockey movie but it's a fun time. If you wondered what if Happy Gilmore did become a hockey player it might have been something like this, except without the anger management. Overall it's a good comedy that lacks some development but worth a watch for sure.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

You are the Norman Bates of late 90's early 2000's casting. You're breaking it though- that mold and it's fun watching you do so. Liev owned, cuz that what Liev Schrieber f'ing does. Ms. Pill was very solid. Can't wait to see more of her work. The coach didn't get enough screen time. The gay jokes were gay- and not in that badass N.P.H. kinda way, but they, they hung in there. Overall? 7.5 pushing 8. This was/is fun without being full of itself."

","Oh ice hockey, oh how I love thee! This was a great film, so much better than I expected (although knew I'd like it) and full of surprises. It had a lot of heart, bromance, humour, awesome hockey and more blood on the plexiglass that you can shake a stick at. It also has some close to the knuckle language and sexual innuendo, that might make some more delicately minded viewers weep then faint, but oftentimes it was funny as well as shocking. It's based on a true story; Seann William Scott plays Doug Glatt - the antithesis of his famous Stifler - a guy who wasn't too bright but was good at fighting and winds up as the ""Goon"" in a local hockey team in the US then is sent up to Canada to play. He's a lovely, cute, winning guy, and you are right with him with every punch he takes, and as the film progresses it gets increasingly engrossing and compelling, with nails bitten to the quick. It is the clichéd story of the underdog does good, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the story. Marc-Andre Grondin plays Xavier LaFlamme who exhibits some jaw-dropping skating. Really loved this film."

If you like ""Slap Shot"" with great Paul Newman or just sport films you should be to see ""Goon"" without fail. It's dynamic and entertaining movie where there are many great jokes, funny situations, tough fights and a little bit of sport. Although where also there are much vulgar humor and blood here, ""Goone"" is not stupid and very kind movie.

","I can't claim to be an ice hockey fanatic as much as plead ignorance toward anything ice hockey related but I discovered that very little knowledge of the sport is needed to understand and enjoy something as fundamentally albeit stupidly entertaining as this. The film picked up the worst, most notorious aspect of ice hockey, the fights and the role of the aptly named 'enforcer' (basically, the guy responsible for knocking the opposition out) and centers an entire story around it. And that's the method through which the best comedy is born. By finding something within a broader subject to wittily exaggerate and create some idiotic humour out of. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, all this lunacy is based on a true story. Who would have picked that? All the same, regardless of its origins, I found the script original, enlightening for a hockey 'noob' like myself but smartly written and employed to create an R-rated comedy. The plot does eventually evolve from arbitrary madness involving bloody but relatively less cringeworthy violence to something a little more civil and mellow but remained amiable all the same, certainly a story worth following. <br/><br/>I really believed and liked the diverse cast and characters. These kinds of movies can really fail miserably if this isn't the case. Jay Baruchel, also one of the co-writers, is the 'Stifler' here, or, to put it into context for non American Pie fans, the foul mouthed, lewd, attention seeker who in all his excessiveness, can be quite funny. The usual 'Stifler' and protagonist, Seann William Scott is pretty boneheaded by contrast, a thug albeit one with surprising sensitivity. Though, as he does with most of his wide-spanning roles, he still makes himself reasonably humorous. Undoubtedly though, this is the most likable character I have seen him play. We've seen the two aforementioned actors in numerous R-rated comedies but Liev Schrieber hasn't been a regular feature in the genre. Yet, he made his niche superbly and it didn't necessarily involve carrying on like a jerk. He just simply fit the profile set out for his character and played the role with conviction. Isn't that the key to good acting in any genre? <br/><br/>Most of this is fairly dim witted and quite indecent. Crudely entertaining though for sure. Although, refrain from bringing ice hockey aspiring youngsters."

","Based on a book by real-life hockey Enforcer Doug Smith, Goon doesn't try to break any new ground, nor does it try to answer any of life's tougher questions. This film's ambitions are simply to entertain, and in that it succeedsto a point.<br/><br/>Co-written by Superbad scribe Evan Goldberg and Jay Baruchel (who also has a supporting role in the film), Goon is the story of Doug Glatt, a well-meaning but less than bright Massachusetts bouncer who, through luck and circumstances, finds himself playing for the local hockey team as their ""go to"" enforcer.<br/><br/>From the beginning, it's clear that Doug (a well-cast Seann William Scott) simply wants to ""matter."" His father and brother are both doctors cut from the Ivy League cloth, while Doug, in his own words ""doesn't have a 'thing'"" of his own.<br/><br/>It's a classic underdog story, filled with every story beat you'd expect in a tale like this. There's almost nothing surprising about it, and yet there is a strange charm to it even when the blood starts to flow.<br/><br/>And flow it does. Goon is a pretty gory film. It doesn't play down or glamourize the role of fighting in hockey (though whether it celebrates it or not is up for debate). When the punches fly, the camera doesn't flinch away. Director Michael Dowse is not shy about letting the shot linger on a post-punch laceration or on a stream of blood as it slowly drips to the ice. In a way, the blood is almost as much a character here as it was in Tim Burton's 2007 adaptation of Sweeney Todd.<br/><br/>Intercut with the violence is a decent comic film with characters that are, despite being typical, somewhat easy to root for.<br/><br/>Doug's team, The Halifax Highlanders, is full of hard-luck cases and scrubs wanting that shot at glory, and despite the impossibility of developing them all as full-fledged characters, you end up caring for their plight perhaps more than you originally expect.<br/><br/>There's no doubt, however, that hockey fans will get much more out of Goon than the casual movie-goer. The film is very Canadian in feel, and blatant and over-the-top crassness of the sports locker room, while accurate, may turn off more conservative viewers.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is hit-and-miss. Liev Schreiber is stellar as Ross Rhea, an aging, past his prime 'goon' who sees a lot of himself in Doug, and the best scene in the film has Doug lucking into a meeting with Ross at a late-night diner, where the veteran imparts some sobering wisdom to the young protégé.<br/><br/>Alison Pill (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) is cute as Eva, a hockey-obsessed bookworm who falls for Doug despite (or perhaps because of) his simple nature, but Eugene Levy is completely wasted as Doug's father.<br/><br/>Worse yet is Jay Baruchel, whose performance as Doug's friend Ryan is so overly grating he almost sabotages the film before it can get started. After the first ten minutes or so, the focus wisely switches to Doug and the film improves almost immediately.<br/><br/>In the end, Goon is a decent little film and nothing more. Its part Bad News Bears and part Slap Shot, and although its story is really nothing new, it gets marks for telling it in an off-the-wall manner.<br/><br/>Daniel FilmPulse.net"

","I know I sure did.<br/><br/>The movie is about Doug Glatt, an outcast in a family of doctors. One day, while watching a hockey game, his friend Pat taunts the visiting team during a fight. This angers one of the players so much that he climbs into the stands. Doug quickly knocks him out to defend his friend. The hometown team is so impressed by this that they offer him Doug a job as an enforcer.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, veteran enforcer Ross Rhea is now playing in the minors after being suspended 20 games for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Earlier, he left the skilled player Xavier Laflamme with a concussion which he never fully recovered from. With Doug and Ross being the two toughest players in the league, fans and media begin to anticipate a brutal fight against each other.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the plot also involves Doug in a relationship with a girl named Eva (a hockey fan attracted to tough players), being roommates with Xavier, and the long and brutal fight between Doug and Ross.<br/><br/>There isn't very much to say about the film itself, but I will tell you that as a hockey fan, I loved it. It's fast, it's furious, it's violent and vulgar, and it's exactly what makes hockey exciting. It's based on the book by Adam Frattasio, which followed the story of minor league enforcer Doug Smith. Unfortunately I've never read the book, but I did watch a special on TSN that recaps Doug's story. ""Goon"", while not totally accurate, followed the hockey portion of Doug's story very well.<br/><br/>If you're the least bit interested in sports and R-rated comedy, go for it and don't hesitate."
"ghost_dog86","8","0","0","21 April 2012"," A Canadian film about violence?!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland <br/><br/>Containing one of the most simplistic story lines in recent movie history, befitting the attention span of hockey fans, ""Goon"" surprisingly is a film which displays a comedic chemistry that is not only constantly funny and entertaining, but, at the end of the day, is only one step below a film the caliber of ""Slap Shot"".<br/><br/>Forgettably directed by Canadian born Michael Dowse (Take Me Home Tonight), but brilliantly adapted by Canadians Jay Baruchel (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and Evan Goldberg (Superbad), from a novel by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith, ""Goon"" stars Seann William Scott (American Pie) and is based on the true story of Doug Glatt. If you don't know who Doug Glatt is, it's OK. You'll probably never hear about him again. Doug is a somewhat timid and dumb bartender, who is uniquely used as an enforcer of sorts. One day, during a hockey game, Doug, accompanied by his friend (played by Baruchel) gets into a fight in the stands, which goes viral. Literally moments later (around 12 minutes into the movie) Doug is recruited to play semi-pro Hockey in Canada, not for any hockey skills he may have, but more for his ability to throw down. And just like that, he becomes a star.<br/><br/>A half hour into ""Goon"", it becomes quite evident of how the director's best friend in the first act is the sports montage. If you don't get my analogy, what I mean is that ""Goon"" is working with the absolute minimal amount of exposition. Also, in almost an attempt to extend the plot, there is semi endearing love story which occurs between Doug and Eva, the exceptionally well written female hockey groupie, which flows pretty well with the story, but is nothing new.<br/><br/>Sounds like I really didn't care for this movie, right? Well, for a while I didn't, but then ""Goon"" began to focus less on the dimwitted Doug character and incorporate more and more of his teammates. And with that comes the most comically intriguing and well written aspect of this film; the quirky (and very raunchy) side characters and the interactions they have with each other. These supporting players did more than give ""Goon"" a necessary comic distraction from the one dimensional Doug, they gave an entirely new life to a film which was gearing up to be as forgettable as ""She's out of My League"". At times, scenes within ""Goon"" play out like ""Major League"", aka a superbly written buddy team comedy, with very unusually outlandish personalities, which will undoubtedly keep audiences invested in the characters, even if they are not interested at all in the subject matter.<br/><br/>Furthermore, critics may be giving Scott way too much credit here. Although he does play the sympathetic dullard (the Rocky archetype) fairly well, the character itself grows tiresome fast. In all actuality, it is a mixture of a very funny supporting cast and some fantastic writing from Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg that keeps the hum drum plot line quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Final Thought: All jokes aside, if you don't know me personally, and couldn't tell by now, I am not a hockey fan AT ALL. So, the fact that I, above all others, am recommending ""Goon"" means that this is one movie that truly transcends sports all together. Yes, there are a few inside jokes, which one either has to be a huge hockey fan or from Canada to understand, but overall, ""Goon"" is a film that, even if one doesn't like sports (or likes real sports, such as football or basketball) many will find themselves being pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is the real-life personification of the term, ""Black Sheep."" Coming from a family of well-respected doctors, Doug is a less-than-cerebral tough guy who works as a bouncer specifically called upon to rough up unruly customers. His luck begins to change, however, when his friend Ryan (Jay Baruchel) takes him to a minor league hockey game during which he lays a beating on an opposing player. This catches the eye of the team's coach and soon Doug has suited up and become a local celebrity. Even more remarkable, Doug is soon called up to a real minor league team and tasked with protecting Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), a young hotshot who has lost his way since a violent on-ice hit from longtime enforcer Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber). While Doug initially struggles with his role as a goon who isn't valued as a hockey player, he and his teammates come together with a playoff berth on the line, setting up a dramatic confrontation between the old veteran (Rhea) and the young upstart (Doug). <br/><br/>There isn't just a whole lot that can be said about Goon other than this: it is fun. Not an excessive, ""I can't wait to see that again"" amount of fun but a reasonable, ""This just popped up on HBO and I have 90 minutes to kill"" amount of fun. The movie doesn't have much of an agenda and there isn't much of a plot to speak of, but it sets out to cover the life of a minor league hockey enforcer and it does that quite well. I've never been much of a hockey guy so I have no idea where this movie ends up on the ""realistic"" scale but it is at least as believable as The Mighty Ducks which is, I think we can all agree, the gold standard for hockey movies. (I'm half kidding there.) Goon is predictable and overtly paint-by-numbers but it is not without charm and it handles its subject matter with a light-hearted affection.<br/><br/>What is not predictable about this movie is the strength of the performances provided by the leads. Scott is, in my opinion, one of the more underrated comedic actors of his generation. He'll never be taken all that seriously because his most widely-known character (Stifler from American Pie) is an over-the-top, offensive buffoon but I've always been impressed with his timing and his ability to make a movie or scene funny when it really shouldn't be. (Case in point: Cop Out.) Here he turns Doug into a likable and appealing hero, a very important aspect in an underdog sports movie. Baruchel's hockey fanatic with a Wayne's World- like cable access TV show is ridiculous and absurd but he is nonetheless an entertaining and dare I say essential part of the film's equation. And Schreiber, truly one of the great character actors of our time, contributes a solid and believably menacing performance that provides the genial Doug with a much meaner counterpart. I'm not arguing that Scott, Baruchel, or Schreiber should be given consideration during award season but the truth of the matter is low-rent comedies like this one are often rife with mailed-in, half-hearted performances. Instead, Goon offers stars that seem invested in the material and the film benefits substantially from their interest.<br/><br/>Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

Goon is intelligent and stupid at the same time, and if you scratch beneath the surface, it actually sends a very powerful and inspiring message. Even the message is intelligent and stupid at the same time: know your limits, accept and enjoy them. Seann William Scott effortless performance of Doug Glatt along with Jay Baruchel as a comic relief are the things that I really liked, along with that whole hockey, macho vibe that every man can relate too. Beer, blood and ice, never-mind the game. Then again this movie is strangely cut, with the story propelling forward without its characters and their motivations, but I guess some sacrifices had to be made. Based on a book ""Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey"" by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith, Goon is a relaxing sports comedy that begs to be watched with a couple of beers.<br/><br/>Doug Glatt is a bouncer at his local club and a great hockey fan. His parents are not so proud of him, since his brother is a doctor and they expected much more of him. But one day, after a fight that he easily won, Doug is given an opportunity in the local hockey club to show his fighting skills but on ice. He accepts it and suddenly he is thrown into a real world of hockey where his fighting skills are essential to his teams success.

This movie has to be the f-bomb champion of the year) Sure there are Hollywood liberties taken but nothing that's too much to overlook or for the story to overcome. It's certainly not a complex story or character but that's part of its charm. It's a story about a hockey enforcer that's a bit of a simpleton and knows it. It's based on the true life of minor leaguer Doug Brown but has to be loosely based. I know nothing of him but I'm wondering if Liev Schreiber's character is loosely based on Marty McSorley?

","Goon (2011)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Decent comedy about bouncer Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a simple man whose parents are ashamed of him because he never amounted to anything special. One night while at a hockey game he ends up beating the pulp out of one of the players so he's given a contract and quickly works himself up as an enforcer and soon he's going toe to toe against his idol (Liev Schreiber). If you're expecting something like SLAP SHOT then you're going to be disappointed as this film comes no where close to that classic but GOON still manages to be entertaining even though I think it falls well short of being a good movie. For a comedy there are enough good scenes to make this movie work including a hilarious bit inside the locker room where a couple guys are sexually assaulting the goalkeeper's helmet, which just happens to have pictures of his mother on it. This scene is an extremely funny one as are many of the fights that Glatt gets involved in. An enforcer is basically someone who can't play hockey but they're a good fighter so they're sent into the game to cause damage. These fighting scenes are actually well-staged and I thought for the most part they contained a lot of energy and fire. I thought Seann William Scott did a pretty good job in the lead role as he manages to make you believe that the character is soft-spoken and kind while at the same time, when it comes time to his job, he's ready to explode into violence. Schreiber also surprised me with how well he played the older role of a vet on his final days. Co-writer Jay Baruchel plays the annoying friend who really killed a lot of the film for me and I thought the role as the groupie/girlfriend (Alison Pill) was well acted but the screenplay didn't do her any justice. The biggest problem I had with the film is that I simply couldn't connect to any of the characters. Outside the lead I found most of them to be pretty standard characters and I just couldn't care about any of their problems. This includes the young hotshot, the gay brother or anyone else that we're introduced to."

","There is nothing innately entertaining to me about two men beating each other to bloody pulps in a hockey rink. Although ""Goon"" contains numerous scenes depicting icy carnage, violence is not what it's really about, and for that, I'm extremely grateful. If you want to break it down into essentials, it's a quirky, darkly funny story about finding your place in the world and the value of fidelity. That this comes through in a film where the actors use foul language and obscene gestures as if being paid by the minute is nothing short of miraculous. And I don't think too many filmmakers would have the nerve to highlight scenes of blood spraying and teeth flying with passages from ""Nessun Dorma."" Of course, the aria is about the prospect of victory, which is appropriate for this story.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on the life of Doug Smith, a former minor-league hockey player from Hanover who, throughout the 1980s and '90s, was affiliated with several teams as an enforcer, where his job was to protect his teammates and act as a deterrent by fighting unruly opposing players. After retiring in 1998, he became a hockey referee, a coach for the Boston Bruins, and a police officer, a position he holds to this day. With the assistance of Adam Frattasio, he would document his experiences in the autobiography ""Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey."" The film reinterprets him as Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), a simpleton from Massachusetts whose gift for beating people up gets him promoted from an American barroom bouncer to a Canadian hockey enforcer.<br/><br/>Glatt is a surprisingly sympathetic and compelling character. He knows he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. He's not one for big words, or even little words. In fact, his vocabulary is so limited that he can't even come back at someone with an insult. Although he can rough someone up with the best of them, and although he can take just as well as he can give, he's not one of those angry nutcases that go out seeking trouble. As a bouncer, he punches people out only because it's his job. In his personal life, he will defend himself and others if the occasion calls for it. Otherwise, he's an all-around decent guy. He's an embarrassment to his parents (Eugene Levy and Ellen David), who wanted him to become a doctor, like his brother (David Paetkau) – who is himself an embarrassment simply because he's gay. Unfortunately, physical aggression is the only thing Glatt is good at.<br/><br/>When he attends a hockey game with his foulmouthed friend and die-hard hockey fan, Pat (Jay Baruchel, also one of the screenwriters), Glatt gets into a confrontation with a rowdy player and wins. This catches the attention of the coach of his hometown's hockey team, who hires him to be their new enforcer. He clearly doesn't know all that much about the game, but he sure knows how to fight. Glatt's success, which earns him local celebrity status and the nickname ""The Thug,"" soon leads to a transfer to a losing Canadian hockey team. His job is to protect his teammate (and roommate) Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), who was once a skilled prospect but became despondent and bitter following a concussion at the hands of Glatt's idol, a demoted enforcer named Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea (Liev Shrieber). Laflamme's bitterness only deepens as Glatt's popularity rises and the team ends its losing streak.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Glatt falls in love with a young woman named Eva (Allison Pill), who, despite having a boyfriend, has a fetish for hockey players. She continuously admits that she's a terrible girlfriend. She sleeps around a lot, despite the fact that her boyfriend is nice enough. Glatt is not the kind of guy that will knowingly ruin a relationship, although he can't fight the crush he has on Eva. Their relationship is another surprising aspect of this movie; many funny things are said and done, and yet you can sense the genuine affection they have for one another. As a sign of affection, Glatt will give her a plush version of his team's mascot, which he repeatedly asserts is official. In turn, Eva will eventually admit, in her own comedic way, that Glatt makes her not want to be a slut anymore.<br/><br/>Glatt is given some lines and made to do things that are obviously intended to elicit laughter. But there's no denying that everything he says, no matter how funny it comes off, is absolutely genuine. And there's basic human decency in him; he may be a little more than a goon with a hockey stick, but he's understands and believes in loyalty, a trait that doesn't go unnoticed by Rhea or even Laflamme. Above all, he likes that he's finally being recognized and revered for the one thing he's good at. Yes, that happens to be beating people up, but I guess you have to take the bad with the good. In spite of cringe-inducing scenes of comedic violence, and in spite of the incessant profane dialogue, ""Goon"" is an astonishingly good character study. I love it when movies surprise me.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

I've got to give my honest opinion though. That's just me. ""Goon"" sucked! <br/><br/>It doesn't help that I went into the cinema with virtually no interest in seeing this movie to begin with. Especially as it stars one trick pony Seann William Scott, who just hasn't been funny since an ""American pie"" film or two ago. In all fairness though he is trying to do something different here. But it still didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I guess I laughed a few times throughout the flick but that doesn't make up for a majority off it. Its a one joke film! And that joke is that people go to see ice hockey for the violence and not the actual game. The Film tries to be more than this by having Scott act ridiculously nice (not funny!) and by giving him a slutty girlfriend (even less funny!) and a foul mouthed best friend (the least funny off all!) but is relying on its violent (I dunno) slapstick?  to get by over everything. Someone getting punched repeatedly in a cartoon or something can be funny I guess. But here it just seems over-done.<br/><br/>If only Liev Schreiber had been in it more, then I may off considered a higher rating.

"ReelBrew","4","1","2","12 December 2015"," A down on his luck bouncer gets the chance of a lifetime after being enlisted as an enforcer for a hockey team.
","Goon is based off Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey, a book accounting Doug Smith's career as a hockey enforcer most likely read by not a single ""hockey"" fan due to its lack of big, bright pop-up photos of players fighting one another. Now in case you're wondering why I threw quotation marks around the second ""hockey"" is because the hockey that Goon showcases isn't hockey at all, but street fighting on ice. Take The Rolling Stones hit 'Street Fighting Man', throw a pair of whee skates on it, cram it with a Boston accent, give it commentary by Scott Hamilton and you have a flamboyantly pathetic attempt at masculinity that could easily pass as Goon.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy hockey to its fullest. There's something magnificent about watching a bunch of padded meat heads blindly chase a tiny object around an enclosed cage in an attempt at smacking it into a net. It's almost like going to the races if all the Greyhounds were jacked up on 5-hour energy, creatine, and Ellio's Pizza and it took place in some 13 year old's makeshift backyard wraslin' slum. However, what's showcased in Goon isn't hockey; it's testosterone with blades and a bruise. It's trumped up adolescence screaming for their dads to come home and their moms to quit making the blue box blues and buy the real stuff.<br/><br/>Goon centers around Doug Glatt, a bouncer at a dive bar in Massachusetts who feels left without any achievements and must continually deal with the disappointment of a family full of doctors. One night while out with his buddy Pat at a minor league hockey game, Doug knocks an aggitated player out who climbs the glass and attempts to attack his friend. Witnessing the fight, the towns minor league team recruits him as their enforcer, a player used primarily to protect teammates and dish out beatings when necessary. Soon Doug is recruited by the Canadian Halifax Highlanders, and opposing enforcer and Doug's idol Ross Rhea begins setting his sights on him.<br/><br/>Behind all the awful accents, the shoddy facial hair (Except yours Liev Schrieber. It's glorious!), and the Massachusetts-is-the- biggest-hockey-purveyor-next-to-Canada (phew!) mentality, there is a story of heart and equality, of understanding and acceptance. Sean William Scott, looking like he's perpetually hiding food away in his jowls for a horde of baby birds back in his trailer, brings an honest hand to juggling a life that was once viewed as crushingly mediocre to all at once shockingly refreshing. I enjoy Sean William Scott. I don't enjoy Jay Baruchel. Will someone please stop giving him a Mohawk and tossing him in baggy jeans and flat brimmed hats from Lids? Seriously, put him in a Scrillex music video then take him out back and shoot him already.<br/><br/>Directed by Sundance midnight favorite Michael Dowse, Goon attempts its best Judd Apatow impression, fiddling (no pun intended) with dick and vagina jokes around a brutal yet sincere and at times humanistic concept. When we aren't feeling like buying our main character a claw foot tub full of kittens, we're trying not to want to pull the shirt over and savagely beat Jay Baruchel's character. No surprise to discover that he also penned the film with the help of Evan Goldberg, who worked on such films as Knocked Up, Superbad, and Funny People. Seriously though, Jay Baruchel must have the worst luck with women or wants to secretly live inside the vaginal walls of every woman that turns him down, because I could go forever now without seeing him wiggle his tongue between his fingers. Goon's heart is in the right place, its just been punched one too many times in the sternum to elevate its heart rate to anywhere near a healthy level."

","If it wasn't for the sweetness of Glatt the hockey goon, or the light humour sprinkled throughout the film it would have hit a little too close to home for me. I was a ""LaFlamme"" type of player and spent three years of my life terrified at getting seriously hurt every game so this film brought back a lot of memories.<br/><br/>Nobody ever mentions what went down in tryouts when there was no 'team' but rather a free for all, gladiator style scrimmage where little guys like me had to watch our p's and q's or the ice would be painted in our blood by those goons. <br/><br/>As for the story itself, it was simple but the character development made me take enough interest in everybody that it was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>It's a movie worthy of two hours of your time. Not just because of the quality of the actors and the script, but because it's very close to the truth of what hockey was like back in the 80's. <br/><br/>A little too close."
"witster18","8","1","2","10 April 2014"," strange balance going on here.
","Seann William Scott absolutely makes this movie. He plays the dumb, sweet-yet-tough Doug Glatt to perfection. Amongst all the f-bombs(250+), debauchery, violence, and comedy, lies a heart.<br/><br/>Now this is a character that we can root for. A man capable of knocking your block-off, but with absolutely no emotional connection with the victim whatsoever. He means well when he knocks you out. He has no perception of reality, but his brutal honesty and his unusual talent make him the perfect hero.<br/><br/>I visited my mother a few weeks ago, and decided to watch this again(thanks Netflix/mom). A few minutes-in my conservative 65 yr-old mother joined me. At first I was cringing because I knew the film couldn't get one sentence out without dropping an expletive, but I stood my ground because I knew the film had it's heart in the right place. Sure enough, she loved it. I think that speaks volumes. It shows the versatility of the film. It's perhaps the best 'MAN'-flick of the last 5 years, yet an older-conservative woman can appreciate the film for it's more serious subplots, and big heart.<br/><br/>HIGHLY recommended. Granted, there aren't many films to line-up against it, but ""Goon"" is my favorite hockey film. Yes, I love slap shot, but I love ""Goon"" even more."
"treverywhere","10","1","2","22 December 2013"," Seriously Underratted Movie
","This movie is what comedies used to be. I think the character that Jay Baruchel wrote for himself, threw some people off. It felt like his character's brand of comedy would set the tone for the movie. Rather he became a lovable wild-card that balanced out some of the more serious aspects of the movie. The movie has emotional moments in places you would least expect to find them. I honestly am surprised at the lack of response this film has received. It definitely contains post-millennial humor, but this film resides a class with Jerry Maquire and A League of Their Own. <br/><br/>This is the best sports comedy in the history of the genre. Slap-stick has nothing on Goon. This is the most underrated film in a long time."

","There's no deep thoughts about fighting or it's role in hockey. There's no deep psychological study of the goon and his motivations for punching another man for a living. this is light hearted comedic film making - hockey style.<br/><br/>Sean William Scott plays Glatt, a big hearted, strong fisted, weak brained individual. He's not the sharpest guy around but he's got a lot of good qualities including a fierce loyalty and two fists that can do a lot of damage. He loves his role as the enforcer on the team and he loves being part of the collective. His infectious enthusiasm wears off on his teammates and in the end, they stop short of a magical Hollywood ending - but it's a good one for Glatt and his mates. <br/><br/>7/10"
"MartinHafer","6","1","2","15 July 2012"," Very original and very formulaic at the same time.
","""Goon"" is an exceptionally crude and formulaic film. I would not recommend it for you unless you can deal with the ridiculously foul language (unnecessarily so) and the fact that at its heart it's EXACTLY like practically all other sports films when it comes to the movie's structure (hence, it's really predictable). Yet, despite all this, the movie still has something worth seeing--a nice guy playing the lead. Now this is really odd, as this nice guy is also a guy hired to play hockey for one reason--because he can beat the crap out of just about anyone! Seann William Scott plays 'Doug'--a 20-something loser who has nothing going for him. However, quite by chance, he attends a hockey game and ends up getting in a fight with one of the players! The crowd loves it, as Doug beats the snot out of the guy. Inexplicably, with this as his ONLY known skill, he's given a tryout by a minor league team. He can barely skate and has no skills but inexplicably gets the job. And soon, he's a fan favorite, as his fists become legendary.<br/><br/>Eventually, he does well enough that he's advanced to the next level in hockey--and this is where the film becomes VERY formulaic down deep. The team (not surprisingly) can do nothing but lose but eventually, with Doug's help, they turn it around and are contenders (yawn) for the playoffs. It's really disappointing, as before this plot began, the film was crude but VERY original. Now I am not saying that the film is ruined, but the plot is the same you'll find in ""The Natural"", ""Semi-Pro"", ""Angels in the Outfield"" and a bazillion others--a loser team somehow turns it around and MIGHT just make the playoffs (and they ALWAYS do).<br/><br/>So is it worth seeing? Sure...if it's your sort of thing. Although I think for what it is, ""Slapshot"" is a superior film--more original, far funnier and (if possible) a bit more family-friendly."

I wanted to see more hockey playing, but it was not needed to portray the plot line. The love interest was a different approach. The best friend is corny but has comic relief.<br/><br/>If you at all like corny, hockey, fighting, raunchy or a good love story then give the movie a chance.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* the love interest in the beginning you are supposed to hate.

No one can take as many blows as our hero or the patsies he pummeled.

I was on the edge of my seat, cheering, routing. You name it!

Me personally I know hockey, I watch it and know the rules. Near the end especially they there are things that you just don't believe would happen, but then again it is a comedy and no one said it had to be realistic.

"blacky55","6","1","2","23 March 2012"," A few things wrong, but a solid movie.
","Just watched this last night. I can say that it wasn't a great movie but I wasn't mad I watched it. I am not going to run through the entire plot just mention some things, positive and negative, that stood out to me. <br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>I really like Liev Schreiber's character. The movie didn't fall into the cliché of making him the asshole antagonist. The movie played its card early letting us guess that an eventual clash would occur between Glatt (Sean William Scott) and Rhea(Liev Schreiber). It did a good job with their path's to the final confrontation. I found it more believable than most movies. <br/><br/>It used a lot of the typical sport movie clichés, but handled them well. The team had to win the final game to make it to the playoffs, and the team broken in the beginning but coming together in the end. It did them well by underselling these and making them almost minor subplots. I was worried the culmination of the film would be Glatt scoring the winning goal like a typical sports movie, but I was impressed that the climax was the one-on-one duel between Glatt and Rhea. The team winning became somewhat of a loose end they tied up in last few seconds, which I thought was refreshing.<br/><br/>There were a few solid moments of comedy and not just poor slapstick jokes or dirty humor as you would expect from a Sean William Scott movie. The part that comes to mind is the teams captain (Richard Clarkin) trying to motivate the team by relating the impending match and the other team to his divorce.<br/><br/>The movie is short and moves at a great pace. Running time 92 minutes and though I wasn't always laughing, I was never bored. <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>Sean William Scott and Jay Baruchel. In the movie, Scott plays the unintelligent Glatt. He came off as unbelievably dumb. I think the writers (Baruchel is one of them) wanted to go for a likable simple minded man, trying for a Forest Gump type character. The problem is they made the dialog too dumb and it was grating. <br/><br/>It was nowhere close to the horribleness of Baruchel's character. Ryan is the foul mouthed blogger and possibly TV host. The movie doesn't explain much about Ryan, he is just in the movie to record a video of Glatt that lands him a tryout. Baruchel has a horrible Boston accent and has the worst foul jokes. Thankfully it would seem that he only plays a small part in the beginning, but of course returns for the final act. <br/><br/>I am curious to the handling of Glatt's family played by Eugene Levy (dad), Ellen David (mom), and David Paetkau (homosexual brother). The start of the movie seems to allude that the relationship between Glatt, his father, and his brother will play a major role in the plot, yet it is only addressed in a few very short scenes with not resolution.<br/><br/>Glatt and his father have the typical, ""I disapprove of your career"" relationship. It comes up once at a dinner after Glatt has established himself as somewhat of a star for the team, where his father demonstrates his disgust by leaving dinner abruptly. This is I suppose resolved by his dad showing up to the final game and cheering. I am being a bit of a hypocrite in complaining about this, yet applauding the movie for not traveling to far down the typical sports movie clichés. The fact that the movie took the time to establish the family, but never really used them bothered me a bit.<br/><br/>The brother being homosexual seemed to be another plot piece that was established early, but really only served to be motivation for Glatt to fight in the beginning of the movie, as a result of a hockey player making a general comment about homosexuality. There was a funny moment at the start of the movie of the family coming out of the synagogue where Eugene Levy is trying to explain to a friend that Paetkau is only friends with a random guy, until they hug and kiss. <br/><br/>I also didn't care about the relationship between Glatt and Eva (Alison Pill). It was neither good or bad, it was forgettable. I didn't think it added to the movie. <br/><br/>Conclusion: <br/><br/>Don't take the 6/10 as a poor review. The movie was average because of some poor dialog, characters, and general mistakes. I am not mad I took the time to watch it though. It is short, well paced, and I was able to overlook all the mistakes and still pull for the hero. The final fight was very well done. It had a great lead-up and made for a solid ending. It just had a few many flaws to push it too a great movie."

"mattwilkins1","8","1","2","15 March 2012"," Paul Newman would be proud.
","This is the Slapshot of this decade. Indeed, many of its aspects could almost be seen as an homage to the Newman classic. We see neurotic Goaltenders, strange foreign players, and the off-ice boozing and womanizing. that were the hallmark of Slapshot. Gritty, witty and full of inside jokes for Hockey aficionados. The film neatly coalesces the many stereotypes people have of various types of hockey player, without pigeon-holing the characters into a purely caricature environment.<br/><br/>Seann William Scott is utterly believable in the role inspired by Doug ""The Hammer"" Smith. His slow-witted but earnest and intensely loyal character is played with conviction, humour and sensitivity without becoming a parody of itself. A fine balance that Scott maintains throughout the film. Liev Schreiber is likable and fearsome at the same time as the hero's fist-wielding nemesis.<br/><br/>A good knowledge of hockey rituals, traditions, famous anecdotes and the unwritten rules the players have for policing each other on the ice will add to the enjoyment, but there's plenty of entertainment for those who aren't students of the sport, as well.<br/><br/>Cameos by a couple of NHL players - most notably Georges Laraque - add a nice finishing touch to a fun and engrossing classic sports underdog flick.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that filmmakers are often unwilling to license real team and league names for their films. The made-up NHL teams and phoney Eastern league name tend to jar one out of the film and into reality at unfortunate moments. Also, people really need to step away from using Eugene Levy as the dyed-in-the-wool nerdy Jewish father. Typecasting is fine for teen road trip comedies, but more dramatic efforts need a more dramatic actor.<br/><br/>Aside from these distractions, though, the movie comes together solidly."

Liev Scrieber's character of Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea is more palatable and if your a hockey player or enthusiast then you'll relate to his role a lot more.<br/><br/>For me Slap Shot was and always will be the #1 hockey movie ever, but this won't be out of place as my #2, just pipping Youngblood.<br/><br/>Would've liked to have seen a bit more involvement from Eugene Levy as Doug's Dad, didn't really see what point he played in the film to be honest. Also Doug's ""love interest"" wasn't much cop either. If they'd steered away from the silly sub-plots of hometown bot does good or nice guys CAN finish first etc then you'd have more of a ""balls to the wall"" hockey flick for the hardcore viewer.

","As excited as I was at the news of a ""Hockey Movie"" being released, I was equally disappointed in the final product once I viewed it.<br/><br/>There were many elements in the film that offered glimmers of hope that the film could redeem itself in the end, and give at least an excuse for sitting through the many minutes of extreme violence and vulgarity peppered throughout.<br/><br/>It could have been a poignant, behind the scenes look into the world of minor league hockey in the style of ""The Wrestler"" with Mickey Rourke. Instead, it veered into highlighting some ridiculous characters that were mere cartoons of stereotypical perceptions of Eastern European players.<br/><br/>""Goon"" would have been at least humorous, with one show-stopping line delivered by the love interest in the film, ala ""American Pie"". There is a line, repeated by the character Eva, that eventually has a punchline. Sadly, the film glides past this moment and does not allow it to have the impact that was its potential.<br/><br/>This movie should have dumped the vulgar, useless ramblings and antics of Ryan. Just about the time the viewer is interested enough to lean in and start to care about the developments on screen, this over-wound shock-jock wannabe pops up and turns the story into something useless again.<br/><br/>Nevermind the overuse of corn syrup and red dye #40, or the gratuitous violence. As a woman who grew up believing ""it isn't sport unless you can lose teeth"", I'm a hockey fan who understands there are many physical elements of the game which have nothing to do with getting the biscuit in the basket. The main antagonist in the movie, Ross Rhea, does an excellent job of pointing that out to our hero in a terrific scene between the two characters off the ice. We could have used more moments in the film of that caliber to carry us through the ridiculousness that was poorly delivered in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In retrospect, I'm glad we viewed this through OnDemand, instead of paying the premium price that would have been paid in a theater. This film will not be added to our film library."

"areatw","3","1","4","22 October 2017"," Annoying and totally unfunny
","'Goon' is a unoriginal one-joke comedy with an generic and boring plot that has already been done dozens of times before. It reminded me of a bad ice-hockey version of the movie 'Dodgeball'. But while that movie had some hilarious characters and very funny one- liners, 'Goon' relies on the same cheap and unfunny gag for most of its attempted humour.<br/><br/>The main character is stupid and clumsy, but in an annoying way rather than funny. After the first two or three scenes of him destroying everything in his path, it starts to get a little tiresome. That's the film's only joke, and it isn't very funny or durable.<br/><br/>'Goon' is an annoying and totally unfunny movie, lacking any originality or ideas to make it worth your time."

","If I could give 0 stars then I would. I thought I had watched an hour when I turned it off and it was only 30 mins in. Too many fighting scenes which looked all fake. I didn't laugh once. I don't know how these actors wanted to be involved in this pile of crap. I want blockbuster to give me my 30 minutes back at £3.50. I couldn't believe when I saw on Rotten tomatoes this was given 82% and on here 7. People these days like too many crap films. It's no Mighty Ducks if you think it is. It doesn't give hockey a good name if people have never seen it before. America humour at it's lowest. Too much swearing in the script and I am not even normally offended. Terrible film with a bad storyline which doesn't really exist. If he was such a good fighter then why on a hockey ice rink?"

Why can't sports be fair like football, cricket etc., why there has to be violence or goons involved in the team. Is this ice hockey seriously all this violence why can't they join UFC or WBO and show their talents there. The acting of everyone was bad except for Lier Schreiber. The romance shown in this movie was extremely bad such bad chemistry. After seeing this movie I have no interests in watching ice hockey ever again.

","actually giving this movie a 6.5 rating. the movie is a wonderful look into the hockey culture with the fans clamoring for the goon who usually is the least talented player on the ice..this film has a wonderful cast and the lead was terrific emboding the dim witted stereotype of a goon or policeman. the movie has all the little things that one sees when watching the local hockey team play...the puck bunny, the code, the blood thirsting crowd, the stereotype of the french Canadian hockey player, the stereotype of the Russian hockey player, the old school coach along with the prerequisite cursing and bloodletting. Though what separated this movie from the usual was the good acting and the likability of the lead and the dread and evil incarnate of the Liev Schrieber character. for a bonus watch for the appearance of the trailer park boys in small cameos."

","I didn't give this movie a 0 because there are some redeeming aspects to it, a few cool moves here and there you see on the ice. But Hockey isn't about the goonery, hasn't been for a long time. Even in the minor levels you don't see anything near the bench clearing brawls you see in every other ""Game"" portrayed in this movie. A player getting his ankle stepped on by a skate? the ankle would be amputated. A player getting hit in the face with the puck, only to get smashed there a dozen more times while in the crease and no whistle? please.<br/><br/>I guess if you don't care about hockey, and stuff you might find this amusing, but as a hockey fan, a hockey player, and a person who feels the game of hockey is disrespected by the mainstream media far too much, this movie flat out insults me at times. Maybe I'm taking it too literally, but I just can't get over the way that hockey players are portrayed in this film. It's insulting."

","Goon (2011): Dir: Michael Dowse / Cast: Seann William Scott, Liev Schreiber, Jay Baruchel, Alison Pill, Eugene Levy: Doug ""the Thug"" Glatt has been a fighter all his life. He is a bouncer, and despite not being the smartest kid on the block, he likes to protect others. His ability is put to great use when a coach witnesses him pound the oblivion out of a hockey player out to attack his gay brother. He is recruited but not as a hockey player, but as a fighter. This is an independent Canadian film addressing the violence in hockey, but its chief problem is its exploiting the issue. The setup has potential before descending to predictable formula and an ending where it is obvious that Glatt will face off for a brutal encounter with rival player Ross ""the Boss"" Rhea. Director Michael Dowse uses slow motion to capture the extremes of the violence but the screenplay seems to address it as positive. Seann William Scott gives an honest, sound and very amusing portrayal of a guy who only knows his strength but fails to factor in its consequences. He is backed by a parade of cardboard supporting roles that have the mentality of a hockey puck. Liev Schreiber as Rhea is a predictable ice bully whose fate is obvious from the first time Glatt lays eyes on him on TV. Jay Baruchel as Glatt's gay brother is more an annoyance, and Alison Pill as girlfriend Eva who is torn between Glatt and her current boyfriend, deserves better material. Eugene Levy plays Scott's less than enthusiastic father in terms of his choices in life. The message is there but the payoff seems to have been met with a slap shot. Score: 5 ½ / 10"
"bowmanblue","6","0","1","23 May 2014"," Sean William Scott's softer side
","Sean William Scott - an actor famous for playing idiots (no offense, Sean). Here, in 'Goon' he plays a bouncer called Doug Glatt - not your stereotypical 'touchy-feely' type, so, true to form, he takes a job that basically requires hitting people (albeit while playing ice hockey) because it's just about the only thing he's any good at.<br/><br/>It would be so easy to class Doug Glatt as a thug - spending his days constantly attacking rival ice hockey teams. However, for some reason, he also comes across as quite a vulnerable character. He freely admits to not being a genius - fighting being the only thing he was ever good at. He constantly lives in the shadow of his - highly intelligent - brother and, as a result, is slightly looked down upon from his father. It's these qualities that allow us to feel some sympathy for a man who is always knocking other men's teeth out.<br/><br/>Don't expect one of Sean William Scott's typical wacky American Pie type comedies - it's more of a drama, but with the odd humorous moment courtesy of the predicaments Glatt finds himself in.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, even if Stiffler's 'softer side' does involves punching people's lights out.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"estebangonzalez10","5","0","5","18 September 2013"," Seann William Scott's best performance isn't good enough to save the film
","""Everybody loves the soldiers until they come home and stop fighting.""<br/><br/>Goon is a Canadian sports comedy directed by Michael Dowse who has quite a big cult following in Canada due to his 2002 feature film, Fubar. Goon was received really well by critics due to its slapstick and vulgar style of comedy, but I really found this film rather dull. I don't remember laughing once and despite having a strong performance from Seann William Scott (probably the best of his career) I couldn't manage to feel a connection with this sports film. I am a huge sports fan and tend to like these films despite the clichés, but Goon lacked something and it failed to draw me into the story or make me care for these characters. The violence in this comedy is way over the top and the hockey sequences were pretty great, but aside from that I didn't enjoy most of this film. It was just OK but nothing I would be recommending. Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg (who has written much funnier work with Superbad and Pineapple Express) adapted the screenplay from Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith's book ""Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey."" The film is loosely based on Smith's hockey experience as a minor league player and there are a few other references to some other hockey players for the more enlightened hockey fans. Despite not being a huge hockey fan I do like the sport, but this film worked more as a crude slapstick comedy than an actual hockey drama. I wanted to laugh, but I just never found this film as hilarious as so many others have. They've gone as far as calling this the Slap Shot (Hill's classic 70's film) of this generation, but I don't even think this ranks among the top 10 sports comedies I've seen this decade. The only thing it has in common with that film is the sport. The film is ugly and bloody, and I never found those scenes funny. This isn't your typical William Scott sort of comedy, it is very different, and despite this being his best work I couldn't enjoy as much as I wanted to. I thought the love story between him and Alison Pill's was pretty heartwarming, but I would've liked to see some more of that relationship. <br/><br/>Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) works as a bouncer in a small bar which is an underachievement considering he comes from a family of doctors. His father, Dr. Glatt (Eugene Levy), is not very content with his decision of not wanting to attend college and he is always comparing him to the rest of the family. But Doug knows he isn't smart and doesn't seem to find his place in life. He loves hanging out with his best friend, Pat (Jay Baruchel), a foul mouthed hockey obsessed fan, and the two of them enjoy watching hockey goon, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber), who they really admire. One night, at a local minor league hockey game Doug gets in a fight with one of the hockey players and the coach of the Highlanders decides to invite him to the tryouts. Despite not having any hockey skills whatsoever, he catches the coach's eyes thanks to his great fighting skills. He also catches Eva's (Alison Pill) eyes in a bar one night and they become romantically involved. Doug seems to have finally found his place in life, but becoming a minor league hockey player won't be an easy ride. <br/><br/>The film does follow the familiar sports cliché where the lead character's team slowly begins climbing its way to the top after a disastrous start, but it is a very different kind of comedy. Scott gives a credible performance as this simple minded athlete. Liev Schreiber and Alison Pill both give strong performances in their secondary roles and I wish they would've been a little more involved in the story. Goon is a raunchy and bloody comedy that fails to deliver what is most important in a comedy: laughs. Scott plays a character who happens to be extremely polite despite his aggression, and in a way I guess that contrast is what was appealing to the people who liked this film. Somewhere under all that violence and cursing the film had something sort of sweet in Doug, but somehow that never appealed to me."

","Hm, just an average movie. I place it in the category: already-seen. Sure, don't get me wrong, it doesn't suck, it has some good funny scenes and humor. But, the story is predictable. It's a about a hockey team who suck at the beginning, but in the end they win of course. And all thanks to this guy Doug(Sean).Like I said, already seen. Also, it has too much violence. I only watched it because I wanted an ""easy"" film, something to cheer me up. I'm almost sure, it will be better if you watch it in company. I'm so not impressed by it. I guess this movie was my choice because I've seen all the other good comedies. If this is your first choice for a comedy, I suggest you look up some others."
"Fluke_Skywalker","6","0","3","19 July 2013"," Goon falls just short of a hat trick
","My knowledge of hockey begins and ends with the old NES game Blades of Glory, so I watched this one strictly based on a strong recommendation from a friend and good word of mouth. After an all too brief and very contrived set-up, 'Goon' manages to settle in to a pretty deft balance of humor (from a strong supporting cast of mostly unknown and lesser known actors), heart (courtesy of Seann William Scott) and brutality (also courtesy of Seann William Scott). It has most of your standard sports movie clichés, but it's not as slick and manipulative as most of those films. It aspires to be more than what it is, and it achieves that to a degree, but it doesn't quite gel into something special."

","Seann William Scott is the eponymous goon. He is a bouncer. His father and brother are doctors and he is the black sheep of the family. His brother is gay. Scott is a fan of ice hockey. One day he goes to see a match and a player calls Scott's friend ( Jay Baruchel, also the writer of the movie in a terrific turn as the foul mouthed host of a show about hockey) a ""faggot"". Scott is enraged and pounds the crap out of him. He is recruited by the local hockey team and then he is transferred to pro hockey to protect a player who has not been his usual self after being tackled by an old goon, Liev Schreiber. The story is about how he integrates into the team and then motivates them. The performance is good with Scott showing how well has he matured as an actor from his American Pie days. Alison Pill as the girl who catches his fancy is good. However, the movie does not offer anything groundbreaking in terms of story and one almost knows the events which will happen.

","""Goon"" is the story of a bar room bouncer, Doug Glatt, who has an amazing ability to kick butt. One day, he and his obnoxious, hockey-loving friend are in the stands watching a minor league hockey match when Doug ends up in a fight with a player from the opposing team. His toughness quickly becomes apparent, and he is invited to tryout for the local team where he becomes the team's enforcer and is dubbed, ""Doug the Thug"". The rest of the movie is about how he deals with his new life, makes friends with his room mate, gets the girl, and eventually fights the old guard enforcer from another team.<br/><br/>The movie started out funny, but it never quite decided if it was a dark comedy or a dark drama. Too many places in the movie missed entirely. When there was an opportunity for a funny line, the actors just came across as flat. Doug comes across as a big,dumb, yet likable guy, and I suspect that the writers/director wanted to avoid making him a cliché. They must have thought that giving him funny lines would have made the movie too funny and not dramatic enough. They accomplished their goal well enough, but in the process of trying to make the movie a more serious drama instead of a pure comedy, they missed on both."

","I'm not sure whether I heard about this film during the time of release, I may have seen a trailer, but I knew it was relatively popular, so I decided to give it a try, from director Michael Dowse (It's All Gone Pete Tong). Basically Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is just an average Massachusetts bouncer at a Beantown bar who is a bit of an embarrassment to his family, and he feels he's a little worthless and dreaming of something else, specifically becoming like his hero, minor league hockey goon Ross 'The Boss' Rhea (Liev Schreiber). It is while attending a game at the ice rink with his friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) that a fight breaks out between a player and Doug that he is spotted by the coach of the Halifax Highlanders and given the chance to become part of the team. Training starts slow and with hardly any experience of ice skating or hockey itself he takes a little while to adapt, but soon enough his attitude comes in handy and he is set to go in for his first official minor league game. Soon enough, after beating opponents, sometimes literally, Doug becomes a key member of the team and rises to stardom, with Pat, his gay brother Ira (David Paetkau) and many fans admiring the rising star. Along the way Doug also meets hockey fan, or puck bunny they can be called, Eva (Alison Pill), and, to his surprise, after some time it is obvious they are becoming romantically involved. He gets his big opportunity to prove himself when he is to go against his idol and the rest of the Shamrocks, Ross has returned from suspension and is not afraid to really beat the opposition, to a very bloody extent. In the end, after such a violent game, Doug takes a great hit for his team, and his team are victorious, Rhea is defeated with his nose broken, and Eva and Doug comfort each other in the locker room. Also starring Kim Coates as Ronnie Hortense, Eugene Levy as Dr. Glatt, Marc-André Grondin as Xavier LaFlamme, Nicholas Campbell as Rollie Hortense, Richard Clarkin as Gord Ogilvey and Jonathan Cherry as Marco Belchier. Having spent four film being a sex-obsessed jerk and having better success than the most of the other American Pie stars it is good Scott doing a bit of a more sensitive but still humorous performance, the hockey games full of action and blood spill are exciting, and the love story in the plot is a nice touch as well, I admit I did slip out at times, but is an alright comedy based on a true story. Worth watching!"

","It's a bloody comedy.<br/><br/>That's not profanity, Goon is a comedy that serves a generous dollop of blood and teeth splattering across ice, face and anything else in its way.<br/><br/>It's violent, it's funny, it's violent, it's about ice hockey and it's violent.<br/><br/>Lost amongst the high-profile cinema listings of The Iron Lady, The Artist and other such worthy films vying for gongs, Goon is not a threat to their glory and a perfect opportunity to sink into your cinema seat and enjoy laughing and grimacing in equal measures.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, Goon is the story of the runt of a litter, Glatt, (played by Seann William Scott, Stifler in American Pie), the black sheep in a family of intellectuals who discovers his 'thing' is beating the crap out of anything that offends. He's spotted pummelling an opposing player by a hockey coach and brought into a team despite a complete ineptitude on skates. He doesn't last long before being palmed off on a lower league team with little skill and less hope whose star player is a washed up loner who's afraid of being bumped.<br/><br/>Glatt's job is to protect the team and fight any player that gets in their way. Obviously, this being a David and Goliath film, he becomes the unlikely glue that sticks the broken team together again. If that's a plot spoiler for you, you evidently don't go to the cinema often enough. The enjoyment this film gives is not in the resolution to the story but the manner in which it finds it.<br/><br/>There's no great depth; you're not going to be challenged mentally or emotionally and it isn't going to warrant a mention in your Top Ten of 2012 but it is bloody good fun. That's not so say it's perfect. It's not. There are times when, actually, it isn't even very good. It has its fair share of dips and there are some scenes clunkier than John Sargent dancing. Quite often the expletives are tedious and there for effect rather than reason and break up what might otherwise be a good verbal exchange. The love story aspect is superfluous and the platonic friendship between star players improves as quickly as flicking on the light switch.<br/><br/>However, Goon delivers more guffaws than most comedies of late (The Guard a notable exception) and (pacifists look away) some of the violence is just plain funny. I don't propose you try this at home but it transpires it is very funny watching a guy have a hockey stick wrapped round his head.<br/><br/>And how can you not admire a film that has the genius of such lines as ""You make me wanna stop sleeping with a bunch of guys."" <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk"

I can't see this movie being anything special, even if there are funny underrated actors like Jay Baruchel. I don't care if it pokes fun of fighting in hockey, but it's already been done. Original idea with hockey please. There have been very few movies that even use this sport, and done well it could really positively impact the sport (Such as Miracle). Movies have always captured our imagination into the concept of victory and inspiration. Hockey is a fast hard hitting sport with the margin of error being so small. This spells movie magic. It would be nice to see a movie that captures those concepts much better than a repeated concept such as the one used in Slapshot."
