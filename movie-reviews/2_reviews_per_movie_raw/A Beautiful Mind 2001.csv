","A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>
Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting."
"The Mad Reviewer","10","250","312","16 January 2002"," A beautifully written, acted, and crafted movie.
","A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind's greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to ""sane"" people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a ""sane"" individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until part-way into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I came across a review from a ""professional critic"" who blasted A Beautiful Mind for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill."" I feel bad for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.<br/><br/>There are some truly shocking moments in A Beautiful Mind. When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in The Shining discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering Marcee, Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness -- ironically, through his intellect. When Nash imagines that someone is going to harm Alicia, he lunges at her -- and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless act of violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion.<br/><br/>Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word. Russell Crowe is incredible. I can't stress that enough. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash -- his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. And, he better win. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as well. And when Crowe and Connelly are put together, extraordinary chemistry erupts, they just gel together, they really belong with one another. Some people have had problems with the romance part of the movie, saying that the way John and Alicia even started seeing each other wasn't very realistic and why Alicia would stay with John after he becomes distant. But, I think that maybe it started out as just a crush, you know, and the math question she showed him was just her excuse for going to his office and she already knew she was going to ask him out before hand. Maybe she's just attracted to the kind of person Nash is? Who knows? A lot of people are attracted to the ""weirdest"" things sometimes. The crush took over the fact that he sort of insulted her work and she still asked him anyway. When you're around someone you like so much you can't help but be fooled by them. I can't really explain it, but I can understand why she still asked him to dinner. And I guess if you love someone as much as Alicia loved John, then you would stick with them through anything. Even how distant he became, she still stuck with him.<br/><br/>Moving on, I think Ed Harris is, as always, great. Harris continues to prove that, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and ""spying.""<br/><br/>Simply put, A Beautiful Mind is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 15 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie (and still do), thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players. They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality.<br/><br/>Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about A Beautiful Mind. Ron Howard contributes truly inspiring work to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.<br/><br/>All I can tell you now is that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie that will make you cry, but still filters in some very funny moments as to lighten things up every now and then, with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>I hope a lot of people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is a hunk or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themselves. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to ""pull themselves together."" You will understand why they need your love -- because they are just as confused as you are.<br/><br/>In closing, if Russell Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished."
"Boyo-2","10","212","269","17 December 2001"," A Beautiful Movie
","I think its a good idea to know as little as possible about this movie before seeing it.  Now that I've seen it, the commercials on television seem to be giving away too much.  With that in mind DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!<br/><br/>Its a hard movie to pinpoint.  Its not like any other movie I've ever seen, in that a character exists that is not real.  John Nash's mind is the reality of the movie and its not until the movie is half over that you realize this and its jarring that you've been taken on a ride with this man's illness, and accepted it as the real world.  Its also a very heartbreaking thing.<br/><br/>From the middle point, John and you see the world differently because he starts to receive treatment.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance.  Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002.  He really is that good.<br/><br/>
Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent Jennifer Connelly, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie.  Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect.<br/><br/>
I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over. I was shown a person at their best and the worse and everything in between, by a masterful actor at the top of his game.<br/><br/>I am sure Ron Howard deserves a lot of credit that he won't get, too."
"jonwoolfrey","10","289","379","2 May 2002"," A movie with a difference - It's realistic.
","I went along to the movies not really wanting to see this movie, thinking it was a 'girly' movie, one which had more technical skill rather than a storyline. I was surprised more than anything I could imagine.<br/><br/> I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work.<br/><br/> This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly.<br/><br/> As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.<br/><br/> A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought."
"susan_may21","9","175","230","5 September 2002"," Direction makes it beautiful
","""A Beautiful Mind"" is an exceptional story, but it is only and exceptional film because of its director.  Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.  Superbly directed, wonderfully acted by Crowe and cast, this film succeeds on every level."
"nycritic","9","50","64","25 August 2005"," A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Lose.
","The story of John Forbes Nash doesn't seem like the subject matter anyone would want to make a film of, but Ron Howard brings forth his life-story in a way that makes one forget he was also the man behind 80s fluff such as SPLASH and WILLOW.<br/><br/>A life destined to excel once he discovers and cracks his ""game theory,"" John Forbes Nash is, however, a man disconnected with his surroundings and reality. He can't even approach a girl without fumbling his way through an especially creepy introduction, and at the same time he can't stand losing a simple mind-game with his friend. At the same time, four other people make their appearances in Nash's life and all three are destined to change his life forever.<br/><br/>The first of them is a college friend Charlie (Paul Bettany of GANGSTER NO. 1) who later introduces Nash to his young daughter Marcee, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), whom he marries, and a sinister figure: William Parcher (Ed Harris). Parcher has special designs for Nash: he wants him to use his keen code-cracking skills for special top-secret assignments involving the Russians and other obscure elements and on one night Nash gets to see just how dangerous the enemy is as he and Parcher are shot at after Nash delivers some information to a strange mansion posing as an intelligence office.<br/><br/>It's not long before Nash becomes consumed with finding the perfect code and aided by the omni-present Parcher, who supplies Nash with a security code embedded into his own skin, he dives headlong into a nightmare of numbers and codes and soon enough collapses into full-fledged schizophrenia which will require shock treatment and an arduous recovery period. Alicia, instead of moving on, forcefully stays by his side even when he has a dangerous regression and almost kills their baby child.<br/><br/>Stories like this require a tight script and thorough knowledge of the circumstance of mental illness as well as the person in question, in this case Nash. Howard directs Nash's progressive descent into his mental breakdown with ease and in a way where we're not sure if anyone who surrounded Nash is real -- the way he introduces Charlie, Marcee, and especially Parcher and the covert office is spectacular and shows just how strong schizophrenia can be in inducing its victims to completely believe what they are seeing and hearing.<br/><br/>And then there are the performances. I don't think I need to say anything which hasn't been said of Russell Crowe. He is, right now, the only living actor who has the guts and balls to put his masculinity aside and dive head-first into the roles he plays. His screen presence oozes a magnetic, masculine power (and in one scene it's clear the man is built) but that doesn't overcome his characterization of Nash. If anything, he uses his physicality as an asset to clumsily walk around, and there is one scene later in the movie when he has returned to teach classes. He walks with the shuffle of someone who's lost in his own world. It would be hard-pressed for anyone to see the staccato waddle and the glazed eyes that he wouldn't be talking to himself in full-fledged conversations, and the hippie who mocks him, unnoticed, expresses Anyone's reaction. We know this is a genius, but one who has become damaged goods.<br/><br/>Then there's Jennifer Connelly. An actress who as of yet has avoided selling out to blatant commercialism, her presence is as powerful as Crowe's. Quiet but intense, she is the foundation of which Crowe's feet rest on and without her he might as well be dead. Just one scene, when she is about to discover just how crazy her husband is and his colleagues are trying to stop her: just watch her reel around and casually but with authority slap one of them squarely in the face and continue on, undeterred. Marvelous acting. Her Oscar is justified.<br/><br/>The entire supporting cast is uniformly brilliant. Ed Harris nails his creepy role as the imaginary Parcher. Paul Bettany gives off friendly dependency -- the friend who won't go away, even though he, too, isn't real. Judd Hirsch, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer provide solid support in small roles.<br/><br/>A complex movie about mental illness as well as the power of love and the triumph of the soul (even if love -- the devotion between Alicia and John -- is excruciatingly strained at times), A BEAUTIFUL MIND is truly, a beautiful experience and justly won the Oscar for Best Movie and Director and should have also won Best Actor, but Russell Crowe will stick around for quite some time giving powerhouse performances. He is one strong actor to follow. I know I will."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","97","130","1 February 2006"," Crowe Does It Again!
","The more I watch Russell Crowe, the more I am becoming a big fan of his acting talent. Here again, he demonstrates his skills in a role that had me spellbound. Of course, mentally-ill people are usually fascinating. Look how popular the cable television show ""Monk"" has become.<br/><br/>Crowe's character, mathematician John Nash, is not nearly as eccentric as ""Monk,"" but his schizophrenia makes for a fascinating portrait of a very troubled man. This is another of those Ron Howard based-on-a-true-story films, so don't take everything here as gospel truth....because it ain't so. (One example: in real life, Nash's wife was anything but as supportive as Jennifer Connelly was portrayed here.)<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film I was disappointed. Maybe I expected more, maybe I felt the story was unfair to the viewer and I felt like this was just one more attempt at Liberal Hollywood to make fun of those in the 1950s who were opposed to Communism. Well, on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago, I didn't have a problem with any of those things, just enjoying the performances and the classy-looking cinematography, thanks to one of the best cameramen in the business, Roger Deakins. I'm not always a fan of director Ron Howard, but his films are usually interesting and pleasing to the eye. He and Crowe seem to be a good pair, too, as witnessed by 2005's ""Cinderella Man.""<br/><br/>For those who enjoy a cerebral thriller, this is a very intriguing film. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas and Anthony Rapp all deliver solid supporting help and, if you haven't seen this, this story will deliver a big surprise. If you know the ending, a second viewing is even more interesting as you trace Nash's actions from the beginning."
"cericsso","10","115","157","3 March 2002"," Simply put: Beautiful
","I wasn't actually planning on going to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" in the first place, but as it was, I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now, after seeing it, I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar, is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr., the genius mathematician, whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self, he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.<br/><br/>John Nash, portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe, is a partly shy, yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant, gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations, set on to solving every problem at hand, rather than mingling with co-students on the football field or in the pub.<br/><br/>Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia (played by the lovely Jennifer Connely), a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.<br/><br/>Enter William Parcher (played by Ed Harris), a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher, after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere, approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.<br/><br/>Now, amidst his work and relationship, Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where ""A Beautiful Mind"" truly shines: in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view. In a powerful and emotional way, it shows the viewer how difficult an illness like this can be to not only face, but overcome, something that people today may not always realize.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I must admit that I was a bit afraid that casting such a well-known actor as Russell Crowe as the main character would ruin the image of John Nash, forcing the viewer to see Crowe, rather than Nash. This is a common problem when dealing with famous actors, but to my surprise, it didn't much bother me much. And the same goes for Ed Harris.<br/><br/>As a movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is absolutely great (It is so much more, but I cannot find the words to praise it enough, so I will simply go with ""great"" =). Not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humourous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. So for anyone whose grown tired of the consant pointless action-movies out there, and instead want to immerse themselves into a character-driven story that might actually bring a tear to your eyes, I sincerily recommend ""A Beautiful Mind""."

It is through her that we begin to understand the range of problems and pittfalls Nash is facing, most of his own devising. She deserves an Oscar, period.<br/><br/>The director has arranged beautiful 'red herrings' to kept viewers guessing and it works suprisingly well.

","It's not that common people knew John Forbes Nash jr., a Princeton mathematician after he recieved Nobel Prize for his ""Game Theory"". It's not that people started to know him after Sylvia Nasar wrote his biography. What made John Nash a household name is Ron Howard's brilliant direction and Russell Crowe's excellent performance as the scizophrenic genious.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe exceeds all of his past performances in this film. He did not act as Nash, he became Nash. His facial expression while solving a problem, his innocent and shy smile during romantic sequences and his vacant look during the time of scizophrenia are in a word magnificient, and shockingly original. Jennifer Connelly also put a beautiful performance as his devoted wife Alicia. The actings of these two are the core of success of this film. I am still in a dark why Crowe is denied his Oscar for the best actor.<br/><br/>
Ron Howard changed the original story in some places a bit, but only to make it more enjoyable. His main goal was to feature Nash's point of view to his world and he has succeeded totally. The shot in the cafe` where Nash first understands the significance of the application of his theory is brilliantly taken and is the best example of Howard's genious as a filmmaker. The make-up throughout the film is drop-dead gorgeous as they showed Nash and Alicia aging in the course of the film. Thus the Russell Crowe in the beginning and the Russell Crowe in the end become two different entities due to the superb art of the make-up artists.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind will be considered one of the best biopics ever. It is dramatic, descriptive, detailed, reflective, enthusiastic, heroic and in all, a beautiful film. 10/10."

The film illustrates to the viewer how deeply a handicap can infiltrate the domestic, professional, and personal lives of those unfortunate to have these types of issues. I hope Ron Howard and the acting crew can get together again for something similar. This was a great film, that also serves an important role for awareness to people that might not understand how deeply debilitating these issues can be, and also gets the message across that not all should be marginalized."

","for some unknown reasons, i almost never liked crowe until i saw this movie. He played the role so beautifully and totally absorbed into being john nash rather that just a typical Hollywood actor. I bet he must have done his homework thousand times before finally bring it to the screen. The way he walks, the way he slide himself between the gate at the abandoned warehouse where he thought was a Russian secret movement operation center, the way he talks, in fact, everything, was portrayed perfectly that it actually concealed that very russell crowe that i never actually liked.<br/><br/>The movie was somehow close to me as my uncle, who was a genius,also suffered from schizophrenia, but passed away years ago. I cried when nash was seen sitting on his house balcony because i remembered that was how my uncle used to sit for hours, solving puzzles. the only difference is that, nash had all the chances and supports from peers and the society but my uncle never did. It was a shame.<br/><br/>Connelly was good as ever, and she had always seen carrying this type of role. Loving yet not so mushy, smart yet vulnerable at time.<br/><br/>Despites all the comments about the movie not being so realistic and not really based on the facts of Nash, i still think it deserves one the of the most beautiful movies i had ever watched."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","40","57","5 April 2009"," John Nash, schizophrenic genius.
","John Nash is something of a mathematical wizard. Constantly searching for something with which to make his name, he finds his calling by code breaking for the government. But with that comes a sense of paranoia and pretty soon John is sliding desperately into schizophrenia.<br/><br/>There is a school of thought that says any decent film about the mentally ill or afflicted is a sure fire way to attract the awards givers. Personally it bothers me that it bothers me that people view these films in this demeaning manner. If a story is worth telling then lets get it out there for all to see. Would the cinema world and all those stuffy film lovers really be happy if film makers didn't tell these remarkable stories? A Beautiful Mind is one such picture that divides opinions, although exemplary made and well put together, it doesn't adhere quite to the facts of Nash's life-it's an interpretation that smooths out the drama by way of delivering a safe and watchable biography. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four for Best Film, Best Director {Ron Howard}, Best Supporting Actress {Jennifer Connelly} and Best Adapted Screenplay {Akiva Goldsman adapting from the book by Sylvia Nash}. Yet as great as that roll call is, the big surprise is the omission of a win for Russell Crowe in the Best Actor category. For as tidy and engrossing as the film is, and it is folks, it's because of the big Kiwi that the film breaks free of your standard emotional heart tugger. It's a superlative performance from Crowe and him not winning is probably more to do with his much publicised dust up at the BAFTAS a few weeks before the Oscar ceremony: than his undoubted acting ability.<br/><br/>The film as a whole should not be viewed as a representation of John Nash's life, many important things from Sylvia Nash's book have been omitted. But crucially it's important to note that in making this film, the makers have brought Nobel Prize winner Nash to the public's attention, whilst simultaneously giving awareness to the sadness of those suffering with schizophrenia. OK, so it's far from perfect in its portrayal of Nash the man, but ultimately the cinematic world is a far better place when the likes of A Beautiful Mind are being made and the film lovers are flocking to see it. And then some. 8/10"

","... and in *no way* as clean, logical, and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches.<br/><br/>I'm 27, and I've spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of logic : because I kept thinking over and over to keep delusion away from reality, and to know what was really going on and what wasn't. In the end, I was really successful because of medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was real and what wasn't.<br/><br/>So, I feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud. Not only does it cheat with the main character's story (who wasn't faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting, tamed view of schizophrenia - which is entirely missing the point.<br/><br/>Schizophrenia is a mind structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic *isn't* a ""normal man with a disease"", it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people : for him, things like time, space, and people's personalities aren't solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate, and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, very imaginative inner world which ""normal"" people don't expect - but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people, and his world gets poorer and poorer until he finishes in a blank, delusive dead end.<br/><br/>This is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous ""cure"", tear-jerking movie. It should be violently frightening. People other than the main character should appear strange, weird and absurd, like in Lynch's ""Eraserhead"", for example. There should be *really* impressive, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about *details*.<br/><br/>I mean, watch ""Naked Lunch"", ""Lost Highway"", read P.K. Dick's ""Martian Time-Split"" or ""Ubik"", DO watch ""The Cell"", ""Perfect Blue"", ""Dark City"", or play ""American McGee's Alice"" on PC, and you may have a vague idea of what it's like. Don't watch the ""feel good"" movie of the month, with banal situations, cleaned characters and visuals, and stupid plot tricks. ""The Cell"" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing, and very, very scary.<br/><br/>Once again, Schizophrenia isn't about details, it's not a neat, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and won't let you go : walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you go backward in time, you're not sure you're who you think you are, everything feels... strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap-like melodrama"

","Ron Howard has given us a film that's so different from the formula-oriented fare we receive from Hollywood, that this film, although studio born and bred, plays very much as an independent film. <br/><br/>The madness of John Nash is approached by the director, and the writer, Akiva Goldsman, with great honesty and restraint. The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past, when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994, with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life, as well as his own marriage.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard, whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. <br/><br/>Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and make-believe world.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise though, is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work, mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream, that she is in a league of her own. She's that rare breed of actresses that go from film to film acting in roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype. <br/><br/>Congratulations to Mr. Howard for this film."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>So frustrating. Once again we have an inept film about mathematics. Hard to understand: film is visceral, drawing from visually-based insights as abstractions of reality. That also describes the most exciting kind of mathematics.<br/><br/>The magic of the Lord of the Rings books wasn't in the story, but in the creation of an alternative world, complete with cosmology. The film lacks that inner reality and instead focuses on the story, basically one escape after another. But it is rousing good fun on that level. And so we have here. As with `Lord,' `Mind' knows where all the emotional strings are and pulls enough of them in the right order that we get successfully manipulated. But this film misses the opportunity of a lifetime to merge the images of math and film.<br/><br/>There are three good opportunities here, all missed:<br/><br/>The Nash Story Part 1: Mathematics is a matter of invention more than discovery. A clever mathematician can shape abstractions that influence all thought that follows. It is as close to God as one can get, and since most of the world is imaginary, one can argue that God will be bested at some point -- if it hasn't already occurred. There are conflicting factors involved: you need to be novel, but it must bind to some part of the world that exists. The unfamiliar made familiar; which can be done through `proofs' which is a way of presenting the new in such a way that everyone believes the world was made that way all along.<br/><br/>Which means you have to be extraordinarily clever in approaching a problem from an odd angle and finding the linkage. Nash was the best mind of the century in this first (challenging both Einstein and Von Neumann!). That's saying a whole lot. It means you have to have an intense focus that you maintain uninterrupted for months. The very idea exhausts. Nash had this in spades, perhaps his most remarkable quality because it was something he taught himself to do. Finally, mathematics is a verbal art, constructed in narratives with colleagues, not intrinsically in funny symbols as cartoons and movies would have it.<br/><br/>So think of this: you must talk with peers using a common vocabulary; but you must not in order to stay important and novel. You must shape the new in small terms, but have a global focus, holding mental orgasms for months. The tension between reaching far into the cosmos and keeping it in a conversation must have been immense. The book on which this film is based focuses on the social devolution of Nash, but the more interesting side is where his unanchored voyages took him. The film didn't mine this lode. In reality, Nash was not incompetent with soliciting sex: in fact he was very smooth and conducted multiple simultaneous bisexual affairs. That was part of the focused exercise to relate to the `world as-is.' Where he was incompetent was in mapping his visions to our lesser reality.<br/><br/>The Nash Story 2: Nash's madness was almost certainly caused by his `breaking' his mind by straying too far from reality to get outside this large problem he was working. The conspiracies came not from cold war silliness but something far deeper: Phil Dick science fiction and Kabbalah. Not stupid numbers but topologies (forms). Not codes but manifold patterns in higher spaces. Literally extraterrestrial voices. By the way: Alicia was as crazy, but I suppose since she had an uninteresting mind, it is not worth watching.<br/><br/>The most powerful scene (in the book at least) is when Nash and poet Robert Lowell were in the same `hospital.' Lowell entered Nash's room and mind daily and held forth on both for visitors. `Every word was his best friend.' Quite possibly the century's most imaginative and literate minds melded. I would have loved to have been there. (In fact I was in a thin way. I took the class Nash taught right after he was first committed -- his acolyte emulated his manner.)<br/><br/>The Nash Story 3 is the story about the Nobel. Uncle Alfie didn't like mathematicians (read `Jews') so refused to establish a prize in math. The `economics' was an independent prize grafted onto the Nobels as an `almost' Nobel. Most scientists are uncomfortable with economics being treated like physics because it is more obviously a constructed reality. Nash's prize prompted a debate within the Nobel community that destroyed the economics prize and is eating away at whether there is anything left but math when you skim more than superficially. It is one of the most profound institutional self-examinations ever. The film didn't mine this lode either.<br/><br/>All missed opportunities. Wouldn't you like to have been transported rather than merely made to cry?<br/><br/>What we get instead is a powerful actor and a competent director. Crowe's trick is to project his character not only into the space around him but into the space of the following scene -- largely by physical motion, usually involving the forehead. Good. But the mannerisms are not those of a mathematician in the Wiener tradition. The accent is not accurate, just an excuse to give new rhythms to the bland lines. The effect of the madness is not true, reflecting prior movies more than reality.<br/><br/>Howard's directing is completely without risk, art, interest. The one effect he tries is a bunch of fiddling with glass: shots through windows, often with (irrelevant) mathematical doodles. These are amateurish because the film has no inner cosmology within which one can register the metaphor. Compare this with the use of glass in `Spy Game.' MIT has a specific, abstract feel that is very easy to capture, but it somehow eluded the location scout.<br/><br/>See it. Enjoy it. But weep for the `lesser mortals' who fabricated it and mind the opportunities they missed."

","Now this is the Russell Crowe I know and love.  The Insider, L.A. Confidential... and now chalk up another calculating masterful performance.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind tells the autobiographical story of John Forbes Nash Jr. a distinguished professor from Princeton who went on to make some great theories and win the nobel prize.  The centerpiece of the story is the fact that John Nash suffers from schizophrenia a debilitating condition for most people which leaves them helpless.  Thus it is amazing that Nash has been able to achieve what he has.  For the most part of the story his hallucinations turn out to institutionalize him at one point, when he thinks the Russians are trying to secretly send him coded messages through news publications.<br/><br/>First off the main performance by Crowe as Nash is amazing.  This is the performance that I know he is capable of, complicated, passionate and serious, none of this gutteral one line BS that he uttered in Gladiator. Here we have a marvelous performance that Crowe spins as we watch Nash fall into despair, every twitch, eyes darting, and Nash's helplessness this is not an easy task for any actor.  Nash is a recluse, almost an autistic savant, we see how he trys out his theories by writing on glass windows and stuffing himself in a corner of the library.  He is seriously gifted, but a social misfit.  Early on we hear how Nash describes how a grade school teacher mentioned that he was born with 2 heapings of brain but only 1/2 of heart.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's direction is great in exposing Nash's life.  Probably the best scenes involve the use of how Nash comes up with his theories such as why the dynamics of a colleagues tie is so bad, or how a plan to get all of his college buddies laid leads to a theory that makes him famous.<br/><br/>Also what else can I say about Jeniffer Connely who plays his wife in the film.  She is passionate and gives a full perfect 10 performance as well as the wife who is trying to survive with a husband she can't help.  But the greatest achievement of this film is how it portrays mental illness from the perspective of the person suffering it.<br/><br/>Most films that deal with someone with a mental condition always place the focus on the people who are outside the person suffering, watching from a distance, trying to understand.  Here we have a film that literaly puts us in the mind of the sufferer, as to what it is to live with such a debilitating illness.  We get Nash's sense of accomplishment, but also his demons and paranoia.  And probably the most important thing is that we understand that mental illness isn't something that gets cured, the people have to live with it, and it never goes away.<br/><br/>Also Crowe and Connely age in this film wonderfuly, so many films try to age actors/actresses in makeup and it doesn't work, but here it is done flawlessly..<br/><br/>Minor faults in the film deal with that some of the supporting characters are reduced to props and people we don't know, and at one point the film bogs slightly when Nash is trying to return to Princeton to study.  But these points are minor since the performances of the main characters are so well done, and the stories focus is on them to begin with.<br/><br/>Crowe will probably get the best actor for this.  Great film.<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10."

","Even if you ignore the fact that Nash's homosexuality was completely ignored by the film, what about his first son who was never mentioned? The one he failed to support financially. What about his strained relationship with his wife? What about the ridiculous and non-factual introduction of his imaginary friends, which are used as a Greek chorus by Howard and the writers, because they can't move the story along any other way. Don't waste your time with the movie, read the book which is infinitely more interesting and gives you a real sense of the human being. Not this badly directed and filmed Hollywood whitewash. Ron Howard is probably one of the least interesting directors working in Hollywood today. So save your time and money, watch the PBS documentary or read the book."

And it's also an irresponsible and grossly inaccurate picture of mental illness and its devastating effect on the family.<br/><br/>This movie has taken a very sad story of a man with mental illness and turned it into an absurd fairy tale.<br/><br/>That this film would be showered with awards is only more disgraceful.

","Crowe does a great job of playing mathematical whiz John Nash who always had a hard time dealing with people, partially because he just didn't get them, partially because social niceties were just beside the point to him. But Nash had big dreams due to his mathematical genius until schizophrenia stole those dreams. What is great about this film is that the viewer does not know that Nash's imaginary friends are imaginary until the film reveals that fact. What is real to Nash is real to the audience, up to a point.<br/><br/>His wife is not made out to be some kind of saint. She is frank after John is released from the hospital in that she mainly feels obligation. The anti psychotic drugs John is on make him unable to respond to her sexually, unable to carry on with his work in mathematics, unable to do much more than sit at home and stare. This is not what she signed up for, yet she stays.<br/><br/>And after several months of this, John makes a decision to stop taking the anti-psychotic drugs, try to deal with the illusions with will and with work, and try to scratch and claw his way back into mathematics. In the 1950s he is actually allowed back on campus at Princeton where he once was faculty. Today, insurance and legal issues would take that out of the hands of Princeton itself.<br/><br/>It's ultimately the story of how a man has to ""cut one's coat according to one's cloth"", as the old saying goes, of maybe not lowered expectations as much as slower expectations brought on by unforeseeable circumstances and obstacles.<br/><br/>A couple of minor things I really noticed were some touches Ron Howard put into the film. One is how as the years rolled on from the 1950s into the late 1960s young people were just ruder in general. Some of the students start mimicking Nash and his odd gait for laughs. So I guess a growing lack of empathy was part of social progress? The second thing is the reality that in the mid 20th century doctors really believed in insulin shock therapy, even though it is now known to be meaningless torture. What you are actually doing is taking somebody who is not diabetic and giving them insulin which induces seizures. It has been known to lead to coma and death in actual insulin dependent diabetics who end up with an overdose due to their body just absorbing insulin and excreting their own insulin slightly differently than is normal for them day to day.<br/><br/>Do realize this is not exactly the story of John Nash's life. He had a first marriage that he walked out on after his wife became pregnant. His second wife, Alicia, divorced him after six years of marriage in 1963. They did remarry in 2001. And Crowe definitely does not sound like he is from West Virginia, which was Nash's birthplace. But then all of these details would have been distracting and made the characters less sympathetic. After all, if I want to see the unvarnished truth about John Nash I should watch a PBS documentary, not a Hollywood movie!<br/><br/>But back to Crowe. Although every part of this film is well crafted, his performance is the heart of the film. I believe him when he is being a jerk, when he is a socially clueless romantic clumsily courting his wife, when he is afraid for his life, afraid for his sanity, afraid for the nothingness his life could become post diagnosis, and I believe his immersion into mathematics as he battles bravely to come back to the field that he loves.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this one as one of the more accessible 21st century Oscar winners. It is truly a classic."
"gandalf_theWise14","10","3","3","23 August 2019"," Masterful storytelling and incredible acting make for a wonderful film
","I knew very little about A Beautiful Mind before I saw it, and I think that made watching it a far better experience. I would highly recommend to anyone watching this film for the first time to not read anything about it before seeing it. You should go into it with no prior knowledge about it whatsoever. That is what made it, for me, an amazing experience. So, I would suggest that you not read this review unless you have seen the film.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the real-life story of John Nash, a brilliant but antisocial and slightly arrogant mathematician. It follows his story, beginning when he is at Princeton University as a graduate student. Here, we learn much about his character and several of the characters that will appear later in the film. We then move five years forward in time, when Nash is now teaching at MIT. There, he meets a student, Alicia, who will end up being his wife and a huge part of his life. Nash also meets a Department of Defense agent, William Parcher, who asks him to decipher secret codes hidden in magazines and newspapers that he says the Soviets are secretly communicating through. Nash now has to hide his work from his wife and everyone around him as he secretly works for the government.<br/><br/>However, there is really a second plot that starts up right around when Nash is chased in a car by the Soviets and nearly killed. He becomes increasingly paranoid, and his wife eventually decides to call a psychiatric hospital to get Nash help. It is then that we see that Nash has not been working for the government after all. He has been unknowingly creating hallucinations that only he can interact with. Parcher does not exist, and his roommate from when he was at Princeton, Charles, who he had considered his best friend, was not real either. Nash had been putting his top-secret letters into a mailbox at an abandoned house. They had never been opened. The remainder of the film focuses on Nash's struggles to get better and learn the difference between what's real and what's just a fragment of his imagination.<br/><br/>The story of John Nash is absolutely incredible, and the film follows it right up to the point where he wins the Nobel Prize for some of his revolutionary work. It's a movie that you just can't stop watching. Your eyes are glued to the screen, you are on the edge of your seat the entire way through. It is over two hours, and there is really no action or ""excitement,"" but it is never dull, never boring, and it feels much shorter than its runtime. Nash's story is amazing and I'm so glad it was converted into a film.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is a fantastic director, and he really shows it here. This is almost definitely his best work as a filmmaker. This film has some of the best storytelling I have ever seen. Howard's method of keeping the audience engaged and even second-guessing themselves is incredible. The way he only shows everything from Nash's point of view for the first half of the film is masterfully done, and because I didn't know anything about this movie before watching it, he had me completely fooled when the big reveal came. And wow, what a twist. It might be on the level of ""The Sixth Sense."" It's that good. But what I was saying was that the audience is kept completely within Nash's head right up to the twist. We see as he sees, so we are as fooled by his hallucinations as he is. It's all set up so perfectly so that the illusions and the real people never have to encounter each other. Nash can't tell the difference, so neither can we. It's perfectly executed. Ron Howard's direction is what made the reveal as impactful as it was, making the film infinitely better.<br/><br/>James Horner's score for this film is also amazing. It truly captures, and even enhances, the beauty of this story. Music is such a huge part of creating the mood of a movie or scene, and Horner's score pulls all the right emotions out of you. He is especially talented at composing themes that match the film perfectly, and he definitely did it again with this movie.<br/><br/>As a character, John Nash is crafted very well. He is brilliant; you could probably say he's a genius. However, he is also extremely arrogant when it comes to his intelligence, and he seems to feel that he is vastly superior to his peers. He constantly feels that he is wasting his time when forced to communicate with those that he feels are lesser than him. He also has many issues socially, and tends to keep to himself; he really doesn't have many friends at all, and those that he is friends with, he is not that close with at all. The film portrays Nash as highly intelligent, but also flawed and lacking social skills, and I think that this makes him, as a character and a person, much more interesting.<br/><br/>I also liked the way Alicia, Nash's wife, was portrayed as incredibly important in Nash's life. As we can see from Nash's acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize, she was the one who was there for him when he was struggling with his own mind, and this was a huge factor in his eventual success. She was shown to be loyal and caring to her husband, and without her, Nash would likely not have even survived for long in the condition he was in.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is unbelievably good as John Nash. It is shocking and a bit sad to find that he did not win the Oscar for his performance here. I mean, that's just further proof that the Oscars have very little credibility. The fact that he won the year before, or maybe some other factor, obviously affected the decision, and that's just unfair. The best performance should always win, regardless of circumstances; otherwise, what are we really honoring with these awards? Anyway, Crowe's performance was perhaps the defining trait of this film. His complete transformation into this role is nothing short of outstanding. If you've seen Crowe in other movies, you can tell that this is not the type of role he is naturally good at, but he rose to the challenge and blew me away. I mean, let's be honest, this role would have been a challenge for anyone. This was a very difficult character to become, but Crowe did it to absolute perfection. He captured every facet of Nash's personality perfectly, from the social awkwardness to the utter brilliance. Truly an incredible performance in every way possible.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is also great as Alicia, backing up Crowe's performance well. She put a lot of heart and emotion into the role, and it really showed in the final result. Ed Harris plays a very convincing Parcher, Christopher Plummer is excellent as Doctor Rosen, and Paul Bettany is very good as Charles. It was overall some great acting from everyone throughout the film.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is, quite simply, a beautiful movie. Incredible storytelling and direction, as well as magnificent acting, especially from Russell Crowe in the lead, make this a truly unforgettable and amazing film."

","Didn't think I'd watched A Beautiful Mind. At first, I thought that maybe it seemed familiar because of its similar feel to the later films The Theory Of Everything and The Imitation Game. Misunderstood, awkward geniuses in elite institutions, struggling to find their place in society whilst engaged in a battle with their own brilliant (or, indeed, beautiful) minds; it's no wonder that I was drawn to this film because I've already seen and loved it.<br/><br/>Sadly and also fortuitously, I don't have a mind like John Mash's so I was able to watch this film with new eyes despite having seen it and it really is remarkable. Whether or not it is as true to life as the other two films I mentioned (both of which, while brilliant, deviate heavily from reality), I don't know. What I do know is that I'm clearly drawn to and fascinated by those whose brains are wired differently from those of mere mortals. Nash, Hawking, Turing, Curie, Lovelace, Weeks, Da Vinci; these people see the world so utterly differently and beautifully that I'm compelled to want to see what they see, even though I never, ever could.<br/><br/>Ron Howard won 4 Oscars for this film and it's easy to see why. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are exemplary in their roles as the Nash's and the film itself doesn't waste a scene as it tortures us and John with what is real and what is not. This is part biopic, part thriller, part mystery; all wrapped up in the mind of one remarkable brain. It is a blessing that John lived at a time where his conditions, to use a basic term, were at least attempted to be understood, albeit primitively, rather than him being locked away in a padded cell for the rest of his days.<br/><br/>Such minds change the world if they're allowed to. The person in question might never be able to understand themselves or the world they live in but if and when the light shines through and they unlock whatever is lurking in the recesses of their capabilities, beauty and magic are released and the way we all view things is altered.<br/><br/>Hawking's body let him down, the medical profession let Nash down and everybody let Turing down (look it up; it is a source of eternal national shame what happened to him after the war). Great geniuses are so often misunderstood and let down by those around them but we can only be grateful that these people's minds were allowed to shine so brilliantly and with such intensity for however long they did.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful film about a beautiful man. We mere mortals are so lucky that such insight comes along once in a blue moon, even if they themselves must suffer so much. I just wonder if it has to be that way. All minds are beautiful but some are painted with a greater palette of colours.<br/><br/>9/10"

I give the plot and story a 8/10, because, as much as it entertained me - which it did - I was absolutely not paying that much attention, for the film didn't bring me that much closer to it. And, as much the film made me reflect how someone can be successful while coping with mental illness, I thought about it for two minutes before dropping. I'm not saying movies really need that, but a story as profound as this one could've.<br/><br/>On the other end, we have the visuals.
The colors were beautifully executed. Being quite warm in times of genius creativity and cold in times of illness.

","""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I'd say more, but I don't want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash's mental illness--something he's struggled with for many years.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"". It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it's SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man's life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn't particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe's accent. I don't know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia."
"stvincal","1","37","69","2 March 2002"," HAS OSCAR LOST ITS ""MIND""?!?
","****SPOILERS AHEAD****<br/><br/>I've heard it been said that this film is ""not your typical Hollywood movie"", in that Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality, swelling violins and other devices used to club audiences over the head and send them home in a euphoric, feel-good haze that doesn't dissipate until the last bought and paid-for Academy Award is handed out on Oscar night.<br/><br/>Yes, Ron Howard stays away from overt sentimentality.  And he stays away from everything else, too.  Including moments that might reveal character, facts that would tell an honest, cohesive story and ANYTHING that would help make a captive audience believe in and care about what they're watching. Instead, we're led along through a series of hokey scenes showing John Nash at school, clearly AN OUTSIDER (watch how he upends a chess board!  thrill as he tosses furniture out of a window!  cheer while he launches a textbook into a garbage can and teaches the class HIS way!). Every time a moment comes along that might actually reveal character...SMASH!...cut to ""two years later"".  Then Nash meets a girl in his class whose only apparent attribute is that she has the balls to tell a bunch of construction workers to shut up.  Soon they're pointing at stars, then they're on a picnic then...BANG!...suddenly they're married!  The entire flick has this rapid, TV movie-like pacing.  Nothing is ever earned.  All of the scenes are thrown at us in neat, easy-to-digest, simple-for-a-big-dumb-audience-to-understand fashion.  Yet despite this rapid (vapid) pacing, the movie drags and sags.<br/><br/>As for a lack of swelling violins, uber-composer James Horner - raising ""Titanic"" - reprises the syrupy flutes from that film, to indicate to the audience of this film that THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT.  And a good thing, too, because the routine acting and the banal dialogue sure doesn't.<br/><br/>
Russell Crowe's acting is uneven at best.  In one scene he comes off as a shy, innocent dullard, then he's an arrogant prick, then back again.  I understand he's supposed to be schizophrenic but there's a certain measuredness - a balanced realness - that's required to make any performance credible - even a schizophrenic.  This is not displayed at all, and the result is that he lost my believability for the character and my sympathy for his situation.  Top that off with an Aussie accent one minute, then some fake-o West Virginia country boy twang the next, then back again....there's a hundred other actors that, despite the handicap of Ron Howard's direction, could have brought this role to life.  Don't get me wrong.  Russell Crowe is a great actor.  From ""Romper Stomper"" to ""The Insider"" he has given some amazing performances, but he was really the wrong choice here.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly, so great in ""Requiem for a Dream"", gives a throwaway performance here.  In her defense, the role written for her is a WASTE. In scene after stilted scene, she plays the dutiful, suffering wife. Fine, she stuck with her husband throughout his ""ordeal"" (such as it was....this movie's idea of the torment of an unhinged mind boils down to a roomful of magazine clippings and yarn! scary!), but WHY!?  Why not invite the audience into her mind as well, show us her trials, her demons, her reasons for hanging on?  Certainly someone living with a schizophrenic 24 hours a day must have some story of her own to tell?  Where is the slow, measured wearing-down of HER sanity?  Instead we get a marginal acting job of a woman staring out a window with tears running down her face.  POOF!  Suddenly they have a child!  WHY!? Was this planned?  What are the ramifications now? How does Nash perceive the child?  When the baby almost drowns (a scene that could have been and should have been extremely harrowing and emotionally wrenching) I DIDN'T EVEN CARE!!<br/><br/>Finally, it's unclear what this film is even ABOUT.  Schizophrenia? ""Sybil"" - a TV movie - was far more compelling, believable and informative.  A mathematician?  What did he accomplish?  Aside from the windowpane scrawlings at the beginning of the movie, I never saw him contribute anything mathematical.  A teacher?  There is about five minutes of film showing him teaching, but fails to detail his accomplishments, his inspiration to his students, his relationships with his peers and other faculty - NOTHING.  A Nobel Prize winner?  For what?  Admittedly, I fell asleep during the last five or ten minutes of the film, just prior to him making his big acceptance speech.  Perhaps I missed some bit of information, but what did he win a Nobel Prize for, being a psychotic jerk?  The movie neither shows nor tells anything that might support otherwise.<br/><br/>
In short, this movie is by-the-numbers filmmaking, and continues to add to the less-than-lackluster directing talents of Ron Howard.  From what I understand, John Nash lived quite a colorful life that included womanizing, a nasty divorce, homosexual affairs, violent outbursts and strokes of mathematical genius that apparently changed our economic system.  Was any of this portrayed in this piteous, watered-down film? NO!!! Somewhere here there is a good, compelling story that should have been told by a better director - and a better writer (it's not solely Howard's fault).  Instead we get this manipulative, clap-trap crowd pleaser, showered with Oscar nominations and (rather appropriately) destined to take its place alongside ""The English Patient"".  It's unfortunate that John Nash's life was reduced to this treacle.  This ""Beautiful Mind"" was a terrible thing for Ron Howard - and Akiva Goldsman - to waste."

","What if you saw things that weren't there? Met people that didn't exist? Went through life not knowing what is real? Sadly, that is the case for real life doctor, John Nash. He has schizophrenia. But he doesn't know it yet. He is a brilliant mathematician who is socially awkward and doesn't like people. The few people he does like are his roommate Charles and his boss Parcher. The problem is, they may be imaginary. When his wife tells him that he has delusions, he doesn't believe it and will stop at nothing to prove that he is right. Russell Crowe plays a very convincing schizophrenic and does a great job portraying this horribly troubled doctor at various stages in his life. I love movies that are based on true stories, such as this one, and what makes them even better is if they are inspirational, such as this one. It is indeed a beautiful movie and one that demands multiple viewings."
"burton_joanna","9","6","8","3 January 2013"," Exceptionally written and acted movie.
","A beautiful mind was another superbly directed and acted movie both by Russell Crowe and directed by Ron Howard. The way Howard normalized Nash's schizophrenia and tried to get the audience to understand it more was an achievement in itself. At first it is hard to realize Nash's condition with all his eccentricities, abruptness and his incredible intelligence it becomes hard to know he is crazy. The way his delusions seemed so real it became hard to know when it was real and when he had his delusions. Some may criticize the movie because of the spy stuff and other stuff added as just another Hollywood thrill. This just shows the skill of Ron howard to create a picture of insanity identical to reality. While Russell playing nash you never question how realistic the portrayal is, he doesn't rely on makeup or anything elaborate, his walk, words and voice is what makes the character more alive. The performance of Jennifer Connelly was a very added addition to the movie. The chemistry between Crowe and Connelly really gel and you feel that they belong to each other. Every part of the movie came together perfectly and they all complimented each other that made it a more inspiring piece of work. A lot of people should see this movie not just cause Crowe is in it or of who made the movie but because of what you can learn by watching it. Hopefully learning compassion when dealing with the mentally ill. By new found knowledge the next time you see someone talking to themselves or someone you know has a disorder you might understand what they might go through and that they will be needing your continued love. Since they will be just as frustrated and confused as you might be. If you wanna see a movie where everything fits and everyone is at the top of their game then this is a movie for you."

","If this movie is the nadir of Hollywood dishonest trickery and whitewashed falsehoods masquerading as fact, how does one explain its popularity? Here are some clues: <br/><br/>In the part where the film does talk about mathematics, it makes the viewer feel that he is more intelligent than he actually is, which is always a good idea when you're aiming for the lowest common denominator and you want your picture to sell tickets in the Ozarks as well as in Hollywood.<br/><br/>In the part where the film talks about romance, the worst possible woman's picture clichés are dragged out to show Nash as ""different"" and desirable. In actuality, he was nerdish, odd and gay.<br/><br/>In the part that talks about his schizophrenia, terrible care is taken to avoid mentioning the fact that the 1950's persecution of homosexuals had a lot to do with Nash's worsening condition. John Nash was forced to conceal his homosexuality and was persecuted for it by the same government that expected him to decrypt secrets for them and keep quiet about it. If that isn't enough to turn any brilliant mind into a paranoid-schizophrenic, I really don't know what is.<br/><br/>In all the other parts, the bad script and the bad out-of-place acting by miscast actors are immensely aided by photographic special effects and by the music (or rather non-music) of James Horner, the inventor of today's omnipresent minimalist ""fear music"", where the cinema's sub-woofers are put to maximum use to make the viewer feel danger directly through his anal sphincter, the only part of one's anatomy that is actually needed to ""enjoy"" this film as written."

Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, ""I have a chip on both shoulders"".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.

As just a movie, I can see some people will find it interesting. But the movie presents rubbish about Economics and Nash and, of course, game theory. Nash didn't invent game theory as the movie kind of tried to portray. He came up with a notion of equilibrium whoich is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel.  I think coming up with the equilibrium notion is more of a contribution than iventing game theory. But of course they had to change it to make it sexy enough. The movie is full of lies like this.

","This movie is just brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The portrayals of that period in time is brilliant. The directing is brilliant. It's brilliant. The movie may not be as accurate as the reality, but it displays the effects of schizophrenia on the mind and of those around in a way that is accessible to everyone. I would really like to read the biography of John Nash now.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe does a fantastic job getting into his character, that he pretty much becomes John Nash. He is like Eddie Redmayne in Theory of Everything, or rather Eddie Redmayne is like Russel Crowe and Theory of Everything is like A Beautiful Mind of 2015. Jennifer Connelly (who seriously looks like Demi Moore) is great in this too. I won't get into how her character is entirely centred on being a care taker, but perhaps that's how it was. Anyway, her acting was great and the emotions she portrayed could be felt. The rest of the cast too were brilliant and you could really feel how in character they were.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did a great job directing this to be a masterpiece. I would expect that it would be hard to connect with this kind of character and to keep the audience involved in the film, but Howard does it perfectly. Also, Crowe portrays Nash in a semi-charismatic and witty way and as the audience, we are just drawn to him. Great job on both their parts.<br/><br/>The editing and make-up are pretty phenomenal too. The editing of time passing and cuts of scenes make the film engrossing to the viewer. The scenes during and after the revelation of his mental state mimic his inner turmoil as the mood of the film tones down from there to one that is more sober. The make-up is especially noticeable as the characters age and there is a dramatic difference between their appearances – in a good way. It's incredible how make- up can do wonders.<br/><br/>I don't really find this a problem in the movie, but it did add and or change events from reality. For one instance the ending scene with the pens is not a custom at all, and the relationship between John and Alicia was much more rocky than was portrayed. As a portrayal of real life situations and people, I feel like they should have respected what happened instead of 'Hollywood-izing' it. I still love the movie though.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!<br/><br/>Ron Howard's A BEAUTIFUL MIND shares something in common with SLEEPERS , PAPILLION and THE EXCORCISM OF EMILY ROSE in that it claims to be a true story but when you stop to examine the truth you realise that it's not really a true story at all . Perhaps I'm being unfair in comparing it to the aforementioned because in reality the story is similar to Oliver Stone's adaptation of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS in that the source material is based upon a real character but the film invents it's own version of reality <br/><br/>Professor John Nash was a mathematical genius but he was also a bi-sexual and a rabid anti- Semite , you wouldn't know this from seeing Akiva Goldsman screenplay where he's deeply in love with Alicia . I guess centering a story around a romantic subplot adds to the film's commercial appeal , never let truth get in the way of good box office . Unfortunately the producers decide to introduce an espionage subplot where it's revealed later on is part of a schizophrenic delusion suffered by Nash . This subplot is very insulting to anyone with any knowledge or experience of schizophrenia because the victim wouldn't suffer the type of delusions seen here . He would suffer from things like abstract signals where the television would try to contact him etc , a schizophrenic wouldn't find himself meeting mysterious men in black or finding himself with a room mate who is part of his imagination etc <br/><br/>There are somethings that make Howard's film worth seeing , things like Crowe's performance which might have won him an Oscar if it wasn't down to Academy politics . Connelly's award for best supporting actress was well deserved as was James Horner's nomination for score though perhaps Ed Harris might be upset about not being nominated for best supporting actor . I have to be honest and say that despite director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman making an interesting movie about mathematics neither of them deserved the Oscar that year . Best director and best adapted screenplay should have gone to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING along with the Oscar for best picture <br/><br/>And remember if you want to know about the real John Nash please read Sylvia Nasar's biography and ignore this Hollywood version"

She was the best and only thing about this film. The other characters, especially Nash, as played by Crowe, were thoroughly uninteresting. I couldn't care less whether he was delusional or not - he was a boring person. I don't believe a film needs to have sympathetic or likable characters to be good.

Basically though, they're lying.  They end up making his character boring.  Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth.<br/><br/>  The film just moves at a turtle's pace with characters talking and talking and talking endlessly about boring subjects (the schizophrenia doesn't kick in until after an hour).  Only the acting is good.  Anyways, this film was made for only one reason--to win Oscars.  It has a very cold, calculated feel about it.  Everybody looks perfect, everything looks beautiful, there's a big lush musical score, the schizophrenia is presented tastefully--nothing to offend anybody.  That is the type of film that wins Oscars--sadly this cleaned up at the Golden Globes so the Oscars might happen.

Also the story hits close to home for me because my grandfather who was an inventor and electrical engineer also was battling schizophrenia before he passed away. The realism that Russel Crow portrayed in the moments when he wasn't quite clear and also how he was later able to get control over his beautiful mind really was well done and shows the amount of research that he must have done for the part.

A critical prerequisite to an actor or actress executing a role effectively, is that he or she can astutely grasp a thorough understanding of the role itself!! This film has a performance by Russel Crowe that can be compared with Tom Hanks performance in ""Forrest Gump"" and Matt Damon's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"". All three actors in these movies established a noteworthy precedent in the cinema industry by portraying characters who had an intense comprehension of the character's adamant convictions!! In all three cases, these characters had a self worth which exuded an unintentional greatness!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" deals with an individual named John Nash, a hermit with an unassuming cerebral charisma who is considered gifted (i.e. not normal). The denotative explanation of normal is ordinary... This individual is extraordinary!! Not normal is often times referred to in these precarious terms... strange, different, or unusual!!! A person who drives a Rolls Royce is strange!! A baseball team that wins the World Series is different!! A person who becomes a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company is unusual!! An exceptionally brilliant mind is not normal, this movie depicts the ramifications of such a blessing in disguise!!! Reality becomes a rude awakening for John Nash (Russel Crowe). His brilliance is not always easy to empathize with because his actions are so reckless!! He perpetually demonstrates a relentless affliction with formidable schizophrenic influences!! Many people who deal with John Nash encounter this illness with trepidation, and it throws them into a tailspin!! For John Nash, this is an obsessive preoccupation which requires a necessary detachment!! The producers of this movie want the audience to view John Nash's (Russel Crowe's) mental handicap like you are from the outside looking in!! It is for this reason that this movie manufactures a succinct obviation of emotional security for John Nash as a way of giving the movie audience a thorough conception of Professor Nash's dilemma!! Ultimately, he attains a noteworthy recognition from Princeton's prominent academia!! This is an accolade which most of us only dream about!! Ronny Howard and Brian Grazer do a remarkable job at directing this film, as their creativity homogenizes!! Their cooperation with the coordinating producers, as well as the actors and actresses in the movie, was not perfunctory, rather, they engaged in a rudimentary commiseration with virtually everyone who was involved in the creation of this film!! The acting in this movie is terrific!! Why the acting is so terrific in this movie, is mostly on account of the fact that all of the performers in this film were mutually challenged!! ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a marvelous film which left an indelible impact on the intellectually sensitive movie viewers!! Perhaps many of them painstakingly pondered the statement of ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible"". What is normal is ordinary, and, what is not normal has the potential to be extraordinary!! If you stop and think about it, it is truly enlightening when something extraordinary occurs!! If you can thoroughly conceptualize this, than the directors of this film have attained a zenith in artistic gratification which is absolutely spectacular!!"

In this genre, this one ranks among high.<br/><br/>It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Where's the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.<br/><br/>Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: ""cut for show business"". What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! <br/><br/>Next, the movie starts and it's the carnival of Horror: <br/><br/>To depict that the story happened in the 50's, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! <br/><br/>Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! <br/><br/>And ice on the cake: his delusions are ""real"", which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didn't know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and it's a shame. It reminds me of the french movie ""l'adversaire"" that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and it's his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french ""Howard"" thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.<br/><br/>Sadly, Jennifer isn't acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. <br/><br/>If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now! <br/><br/>NB: My real anguish with that itself but the fear of the psychosis. Now, i don't see or hear delusions but I'm afraid to face them in the future. So am i already psychotic and i don't know it actually ?"

Gone is Nash's racism, snobbery, arrest for indecent exposure, history of violent behavior, messy relationships with both sexes, the woman and son he abandoned, the voices that told him aliens were transmitting messages to him via the New York Times, the repeated stays at various loony bins, the nine months he spent wandering Europe trying to renounce his citizenship, the fact that Alicia divorced him in 1963, and that their son is schizophrenic. In short, gone is everything about Nash that made him such a enigmatic yet despicable human being to begin with.<br/><br/>The whitewashing doesn't end there. Parcher calling Joe McCarthy ""an idiot"", and proclaiming how the atomic bombs ""evaporated 150,000 people"" has no business being in the movie, as such ""opinions"" were totally foreign to most Americans, and certainly to those who worked for the government (even those who were figments of one's imagination).<br/><br/>Crowe as Rain Man and Connelly as the Long-Suffering Wife does not tell us what kept (and keeps) Nash and Alicia together.

What a bore. And from what I've read, the movie and the real life story are not even closely resembled.<br/><br/>The characters are dull, the script goes nowhere. Reading all the comments from people blathering about the greatness of this slow motion picture, I would love to hear from real men what they think. But, to each his own. This movie was trying to be art, but so was ""Vanilla Sky"". It was another borefest in the same vein. This movie really brought out the weaknesses in Russell Crowe's acting."
"MartaRusek","1","11","22","18 August 2005"," Why was this movie so popular?
","I had such high expectations when I went to see 'A Beautiful Mind.' Russell Crowe. Jennifer Connelly. That guy from 'The Sound of Music.' Ron Howard. All these big names were attached, and it was based on a true story, so I was pretty excited about seeing it.<br/><br/>Then, I saw the movie. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed. The plot was thin and way too predictable (I knew from the get-go that the roommate was a figment of Nash's schizophrenic mind). And I didn't find some of the events that were triggered by Nash's condition to be very realistic. It felt more like I was watching a badly-written yet beautifully photographed after-school special. I just didn't experience Nash's fear the way he did. Maybe because I knew about the roommate, I can't be sure. But it the scenes with the agent just didn't do it for me. <br/><br/>Overall, despite some of the awesome acting involved (Jennifer did deserve that Academy Award) and the beautiful cinematography, I felt like 'A Beautiful Mind' was overrated and nothing new. It was just too predictable, and after awhile, I really didn't care about the character of John Nash anymore. I wanted to hear more about how his wife and son coped, and I felt like we could have seen more contrast between the respect Nash got later in life with the skepticism and mockery he was met with when word of his condition became public.<br/><br/>Sorry folks, but it stinks. If you want to see a good movie about mental illness and the people who cope with it, rent/buy 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.'"

"sturmv","1","12","25","5 September 2003"," Fabrication
","First off, the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally I think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we ""lesser mortals"". 5/10"
"zhongzl-kelley2014","10","4","6","21 August 2015"," Feel like I was incomplete before seeing this movie
","The movie create an atmosphere like dreaming with smoothly revolving camera angles. I came in knowing that Nash had schizophrenia because I unfortunately encountered a spoiler while going over reviews here, but I wasn't able to tell which part was delusional because of the hypnotizing tone of the movie. Genius Ron Howard somehow managed to filter all the flaws of filming itself to present a story that is whispering love and persistence in every shot, every line, every insignificant details in the picture. I just finished the movie 3 minutes ago, and all my goals and plans for today are washed away, I can't think about anything but my love for this film.<br/><br/>No need to add to many comments you probably have read here, but Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly rock.In social life, nerds and inconsiderate people like John Nash are the first combatants that are cleared out of the colosseum, but the stunning acting of Russell and Jennifer convinces the audience that the love between John Nash and Alicia Nash can't be explain by our shallow knowledge about falling in love. They are above the level of attractive girls falling for attractive boys, their nature, or something deeper, is drawing them closer and closer to form a romance that touch the world with its purity and depth. Alicia didn't marry John for money, safety or his appearance, because John here looks like a wrinkled bear. Alicia loved him because he was where she belonged, and the first appearance of Alicia punched the concept in me that she knew it as soon as she saw him, because she was staring at him with sparkling beauty. It was love at first sight.<br/><br/>The settings were also cool, the scene where Alicia cracked open the door of John's office and the cottage near their house is mind-blowing. The scene of numbers glowing and floating out of screens in the Pentagon and from the magazines lying on the floor was also a genius representation of intelligence, exceeding the BBC drama Sherlock Holmes. It actually makes no sense because they are just random clippings of random magazines, but it also force the audience into believing there are some secret messages embodied in these random paragraphs because we are seeing this from a genius' perspective, it's adjusted to a level of intelligence beyond ours. But after seeing the abandoned building from Alicia's eyes, who was a sign of sanity, in which the windows that shadows were escaping and dogs are barking, were sealed with cement. The pile of envelops tell both Nash and us, that the whole conspiracy thing isn't real, it's as ridiculous as the 911 being plotted by the US government or the world tricking you into believing that you have a nose.<br/><br/>The music is most effective tool the movie uses to mark out the climaxes and the turning points. James Horner was a gift from the god, I cried when he was taken away 2 months earlier. All the music in here is exciting, but it was exciting mixed with sadness, sense of shock, sense of hope or sense of pride. It always grabbed the audience's attention like a mighty hand, and squeezed their heart until they choke with pain. I think Ron Howard should've buy Horner a drink after the Oscar ceremony.<br/><br/>All the Oscar-winning movies perfectly explain something about humanity, and form a explanation in the audience's heart that can't be explained by the simple word ""love"" or ""friendship"" or ""support"", but we find ourselves somehow different when we walk out of the movie theaters half dreaming half awake while mumbling something like ""It's hell of a movie.""I will think of John Nash when I'm walking my dogs in my 80s, I'll think of him when I am unemployed and wandering on the street, I will think of him when I'm kissing my boyfriend.<br/><br/>Image of John writing on the windows in his dorm is still flashing through my mind.<br/><br/>Image of Alicia holding the baby to her chest with terror is still flashing though my mind.<br/><br/>Image of the little girl opening up her arms is still flashing though my mind.<br/><br/>Image of the Charles pushing the table down the window is still flashing through my mind.<br/><br/>Image of the paper about Game Theory is still flashing through my mind.<br/><br/>Image of old Alicia smiling with tear in Noble Prize ceremony stabbed my heart.<br/><br/>""You are the only reason I am, you are all my reasons.""<br/><br/>""Thank you."""

","If you can look well-beyond this bio-film's exaggerated sentimentality, its ""schizophrenia"" whitewashing, and the fact that its story was only very loosely based on the real-life genius/mathematician, John Nash, then, yes, you just might find it's worth sitting all the way through its 135-minute running time (which did, indeed, wear on this viewer's patience more than once).<br/><br/>From my perspective - A Beautiful Mind seemed to be more interested in spotlighting Nash's mental illness (and his imaginary friends/alter egos) than it did about concentrating on his amazing ability to crunch all of those numbers.<br/><br/>As well - The focus on Nash's relationship with Alicia Larde (unconvincingly played by Jennifer Connelly), who eventually became his wife, certainly had a tendency to become an irksome ""soap opera"" bore, which grated on my nerves, often enough.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind covers approximately 40 years of Nash's life, from the 1950s to the 1990s, when he was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Nash is still alive today.<br/><br/>Anyways - Regardless of my beefs and believing that this film has really been so over-rated, I still give it a 6-star rating.<br/><br/>*Note* - If you have the time - I suggest you Google images of John Nash just to see how his looks compare to those of Russell Crowe's, the actor who portrayed him in this film - And prepare yourself for something of a mild shock-eroo!"

","It's the usual problem with a film about someone whose accomplishments are less easy to demonstrate than touchdowns or legislation passed or wars won: How do you convey even a taste of what makes an artist an artist, or in this case, a genius a genius?<br/><br/>Let me say right off that I don't particularly care about possible factual errors in a biopic, unless they're so glaring as to oppose the spirit of their subject (i.e., depicting Muhammad Ali as a Nazi or Himmler as a Muslim).<br/><br/>What really bothers me about this well-acted (by the leads) but safe and pat movie is that the filmmakers had plenty of access to details of Nash's accomplishments, but decided not to let us in on the secret(s).  Perhaps the studio just decided we movie-going yokels wouldn't be interested in that kind of thing... and judging from the mega-box office success of the film, maybe they were right.<br/><br/>The film is called ""A Beautiful Mind"", and Nash is a Nobel-winning mathematician, but rather than delve into exactly what made his theories so revolutionary, screenwriter Akiva (the Batman series, Lost In Space) Goldsman and director Ron (Night Shift, Apollo 13) Howard feed us the glowing comments of others & a cute but not entirely plausible explanation of Nash's revolutionary work.  Instead, the film focuses on (fictional) paranoid delusions in order to pander to the sympathies of some.  Why not show (rather than tell) us what made this man so brilliant?<br/><br/>It's very difficult to create an artist, much less a genius on screen (""Pollock"", ""Amadeus"", and ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" are among the notable exceptions), but in my opinion that is what would have made this a special film.  Instead, it's the usual bland button-pushing, lifted by Crowe's extraordinary performance and strong work by Harris and Connelly in support.<br/><br/>This one's not as hilariously undeserving of the statue as ""Gladiator"", ""Out Of Africa"", and ""Braveheart"", but it will settle in nicely with the likes of ""Chariots Of Fire"" and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in the bland and forgettable bin, should this heavy favorite win Best Picture in 2002."

As the story might have offered some interesting possibilities the film shows us Russell Crowe overacting as bad as he could possibly do. At no time through this 134 minute piece of boredom the viewer can actually believe that John Nash is supposed to be a mathematical genius. We rather get the impression of a clumsy, slighty overweighed farmer strolling around campus.

","I didn't notice any comments here bashing this film, so I think I'd better add one; in my opinion, this was one failed movie. The only three things that kept me watching it to ending were actor Russell Crowe, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner.<br/><br/>Actually, the film starts pretty good. The first half hour reminded me of quality British dramas (like Chariots of Fire), and had a few marvellous scenes. Just as I was starting to think this would be a good movie, it started to go drastically downhill.<br/><br/>The filmmakers (Ron Howard, Akiva Goldsman) get drawn into what appears like two subplots - one about Nash's love affection and one about his paranoia of communist spies - and lose the conception of the film. There's been comments of the film as a tear jerker... Sorry? I didn't find anything emotional about this movie. Towards the ending, it just keeps getting more and more like a bad TV-movie. All characters are poorly written, there is not one single good dramatic scene; a *lot* of the screen time is stolen by imaginary characters (they actually feel more lively than the actual people in the movie).<br/><br/>The acting is hopeless; the dreadful direction makes all characters except Nash seem like cameos and the screenplay really feels as it is written by the fellow who wrote Batman & Robin (dah).<br/><br/>And the fact that the film isn't thruthful to its subject doesn't make it any better, either."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's always inspiring to see someone overcome adversity like John Nash, the real-life hero of A Beautiful Mind. A brilliant mathematician, he suffered from sever paranoid schizophrenia for most of his adult life. But he learned to live with it, as normal a life as possible, and he ended up being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994. It's a great story. Too bad it's so generically told in Ron Howard's film. It's as by-the-numbers as a film like this can really get. The direction is bland, and the writing can be quite dull at times. Shine, for instance, is a much better film very similar in plot and structure. I must make an interjection in my own criticisms for this film, though. One reason why A Beautiful Mind may lack power is that it had some major points spoiled in the advertising. We don't actually know in the film, not until a long time in, that Nash is suffering delusions and fantasies. For instance, Ed Harris' character is imaginary, which can be deduced almost instantly. But would I have assumed that if I didn't know what the film was about? Can't be so sure.<br/><br/>Anyhow, A Beautiful Mind is well worth seeing. The actors are pretty good. Russel Crowe may have given his best performance so far in the film. He won an Oscar last year for a rather lame role in Gladiator, but if he wins this year (I write this the night before the Oscars air, by the way) it will be very deserved. We've got an actor here who will continue to impress the hell out of us. Hopefully he can restrain himself from beating the crap out of people (I think that it might cost him the award, but we'll see in approximately 24 hours! An update: it did). Jennifer Connely is good, but she's been a lot better elsewhere, most notably in Dark City and Requiem for a Dream. It wouldn't be too out of line to award her, though. The rest of the awards it has been nominated for can vanish, for all I care. There's nothing special about Ron Howard's direction. It may be his best film, but that's a backhanded complement coming from me. The editing is plain. James Horner's score is particularly bad. It's far too overdramatic. The makeup is a possibility, though. Russel Crowe's old man makeup is quite good. I give the film a 7/10."

","Russel Crowe proves to be a decent actor, going from college to shaking old man, his acting and the make-up artist who worked on him did a great teamwork. On the other hand, Jennifer Connelly does not age well throughout the movie, and this is critical in supporting the creativity of using a cinematographic gaffe to visualize a concept dealing with the beautiful mind in question. And suddenly, the make-up ages her so strangely that she looks pretty darn close to Helena Bonham Carter from Planet of the Apes! Plot twists a la ""The Others""--to name something other than that movie with Bruce Willis and the kid, keep you watching, and moments of brilliance such as the theory with which John Nash proves John Adams wrong using a blonde and her friends, build up the expectations which are completely blown off by the less than satisfactory shallow talk on which the movie ends. When strings of movies came out as Pulp Fiction wannabes (the original itself from a John Woo wannabe), things were recognizably bad. Now that Night Shamalyan wannabes bring out their visual twists to their wannabe movies, things like this movie come out--you can't directly tell how bad it is, because the visual trickstery feels original, even though the device has been explored already with a better story--even though the gaffes in the movies give the movie very different unintended interpretations. <br/><br/>SPOILERS <br/><br/>when you see that wifey does not get older, you start thinking: is she one too! when you see that the pens put in front of him are placed differently in every single one of the five different shots they appear in, is that another one of his...? When you tease the viewer by leaving a visual clue, you can't allow yourself to leave behind so many gaffes.<br/><br/>

He came up with a notion of equilibrium, which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel. But Crowe does NOT. This was supposed to be a historical film, but due to Crowe's lackluster performance, backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations, his character has been given credit for things he did not do! In a learned person's opinion, this is an irresponsible, and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time, which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done, and his totally crappy, dialed in performance.<br/><br/>This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth, and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe.

Forget that he actually was quite good with women, having numerous relationships with them, as well as men.

None of these. What I keep wondering about is how Alicia, a young math student at Princeton in the1950s, had the savvy to wear a strapless black evening dress on her very first date, which turns out to be a black-tie Princeton do.  <br/><br/>If there were an Oscar for most valiant performance under hostile conditions, then Jennifer Connelly, who plays Alicia -- and who, incidentally, looks great in the strapless black -- would surely win.  Ms. Connelly bares up under awkward editing and awful dialog, as when she, now Mrs. Nash, tells him and us that love and faith will cure him of his schizophrenia.  In the New Testament, perhaps; in Hollywood, by all means. All that's missing is a new-age crystal. <br/><br/>Dodging a story about ordinary humans, director Ron Howard has chosen to chronicle genius, but the product is the same old inflated confection: a romantic night sky in New Jersey that holds  more stars than any Arizona desert; a ghastly Nobel prize award ceremony; and worst of all, the progress to that prize based on one academic paper, scribbling math formulas on window panes, and a lot of frenzied magazine clipping.

","As a young man, John Nash is antisocial, arrogant but quite the mathematical genius. After months of failing to live up to expectation due to focusing on trying to find formula within the mundane. However a major finding brings him to the attention of the Government and sees him set up within a secretive department looking to crack the code that will lead them to a Russian bomb hidden somewhere within the US. Starting as just a series of problems, John's involvement deepens as the Russians move to stop the code breakers and only John's handler Parcher can protect him. Meanwhile the secrets start to affect John's personal life.<br/><br/>Despite all the hype and awards I didn't feel that fussed about seeing this film and just decided to wait for television to bring it to me for free. Having finally seen it I must admit that, while not being anything brilliant, it is certainly a very professional and engaging product despite some big flaws. The story is based on reality (if you pardon the irony of that) and it doesn't matter too much if it skims over some issues and omits some very well-publicised aspects of Nash's life. The story is well written and is the better for focusing on the confusion within Nash between reality and imagined because it does help move the film forward all the time. Conversely the weakest moments are in the rather mawkish and sentimental moments within reality  fortunately these are not that often and generally the film moves forward well and I did find myself quite engaged by it.<br/><br/>Howard's direction is up to his usual standard, by which I mean that it is polished and professional even if it does lack anything in the way of flair or unique talent. Crowe is very strong though. Much better than the ego and the headlines would suggest, here he delivers a performance that convincingly changes across the film and does the tricky thing of making the audience feel and understand a character in a way that was very difficult to pull off. Connelly is nearly as strong in a smaller role and Ed Harris has fun with a powerful character who noticeably lifts the pace when he is on screen. Bettany is his usual self and good value for it and support is generally good from Plummer, Lucas, Goldberg and a few others.<br/><br/>Overall a very polished drama but one that is engaging for the majority. The pace is generally good despite sometimes being a bit too sentimental and laboured, and the delivery generally pulls off the difficult task of putting us into Nash's world and allowing us to feel for him and understand him."

I had read many people who said that Ron Howard had done his best work here, but what I saw was the same old stuff - paint by numbers script (not his fault but he could have done a better job disguising it), extensive attempts at tear-wringing, even VIOLINS in the dramatic scenes - overt sentimentality.  The direction was totally manipulative.  Only the acting, (which was still a bit of the showy ""give me an Oscar"" variety by Crow) kept me with this film.  The Sixth Sense plot line was predictable, and the staging was awkward.  I think it is a shame that so many movie people are jumping on the bandwagon of a mediocre film while ignoring the true classic of a week year.  LORD OF THE RINGS is by far and away the best film of 2001, and Moulin Rouge deserves credit too.  To see a really great Russell Crow performance, watch THE INSIDER."

","Maudlin, paint-by-numbers biopic about math whiz John Nash that makes mental illness and marital strife look as pretty as a magazine cover.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe does give a good performance, I'll give the film that, but I wonder how much better a performance he could have given if under the guidance of a more interesting director than Ron Howard. Every Howard movie I see makes me feel like -- no matter what the subject matter -- he's determined to create a movie that would be o.k. for eight-year-old kiddies to watch. Works fine when you're dealing with mermaids and firemen, but not so much when dealing with material like this.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelley proved that Joan Allen no longer necessarily cornered the market on mopey suffering wife roles, which turned out to be a good thing for us, because Allen was then free to play a hot CIA agent in the Bourne movies.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"guy_lazarus","3","2","3","19 March 2002"," Did John Nash make that speech at the Nobel Prize award ceremony?
","To answer to the question John Nash did not give the speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony that is in the film A BEAUTIFUL MIND; the only Nobel Prize winner that gives a speech is the Peace Prize winner (or the Literature winner -- there's only one that is allowed to speak, and I can't remember which -- I'm not losing my mind, just my memory). Nash gave no speech at all; he held a press conference. The speech is a fabrication of the screenwriter.<br/><br/>Nash won the Nobel MEMORIAL Prize in Economics, which is not a true Nobel Prize, by the way. It is not funded by the Nobel will (which is the reason the guy vetting Nash for the prize explains that money has to be raised for it). I read the book when it first came out and barely remember it (though I remember it being a good read -- that darn memory again), but I believe it had covered the extensive politicking behind the prize which was fascinating in itself.<br/><br/>I thought the film was horrible. One leaves the theater not knowing anything about John Nash (the real John Nash), mental illness, or life itself. Love did not cure John Nash -- the best explanation for the spontaneous remission of his schizophrenia is hormonal changes that began when he reached his 50s. Love does not cure schizophrenia, folks, outside of a Hollywood suds fest.<br/><br/>What is so egregious about leaving out Nash's bisexuality is that the ""Red Scare"" and purges in the U.S. in the late 1940s/1950s targeted homosexuals as security risks. (This explains why Nash in real life was fired from the Rand Corp. -- the ""think tank"" so intertwined with the Vietnam War -- after allegedly making a pass at another man.) Homosexuals were considered ""mentally ill"" officially by the American Psychiatric Assn. until the early 1970s. They were, and continue to be considered, security risks by the military-industrial establishment.<br/><br/>The film is nearly a constant lie from beginning to end.  One mourns for the great film that could have resulted from such material put in the hands of a great director with a taste for the duality/perversity of life as truly lived, say Atom Egoyan. Ron ""Opie"" Howard's direction is abysmal. This is a child actor morphed into big budget Hollywood director that has no point-of-view/take on life other than the box office. Schmaltz equals box office, so that's what we get. ""That's entertainment!"" I don't believe Opie knows anything about what it's like to attend a university such as Princeton, let alone what it is like to be afflicted by genius-cum-schizophrenia or to live life in the real world. It is a movie with a profound deficit in wisdom.<br/><br/>I found the performances to be incredibly over-hyped; Jennifer Connelly is fine, but she does not give a performance of award-winning caliber unless the award is such hype-driven ""Let's honor the latest B-movie bimbo morphed serious actress"" awards as as the Oscar. I was also not disappointed to see her breasts, or her in revealing outfits. (It's the 1950s -- why isn't she in a girdle or some other foundation garments? There is not attention to detail in this film; it's all softened to evoke the year 2001 through a nostalgic filter. ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" in contrast, masterfully evokes the feel of the '50s. I could remember the feel starched shirts, tiny sports jackets, clasp-on ties and faux-fedoras my brother and I wore to church in the early 1960s while watching ""Man."" ""Beautiful Mind,"" in contrast, evokes the 1990s, what with portable nukes, the word ""meds,"" the digital readout implant, etc. Soft focus filmmaking, geared towards not challenging the audience even minutely.) I mention Connelly's assets as after watching her over many years, including her wonderful turn in ""Waking the Dead,"" one comes to expect seeing her breasts, or oogling her in something sexy. You're disappointed when it doesn't come off.<br/><br/>The one-note performance of Russell Crowe makes me doubt my earlier assessment of him as a very talented actor. There is no development at all in his characterization of John Nash, and while I would like to blame the director, I think back on his performances in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER (the latter of which I liked enormously) and see his Nash is just a variation of his ""wounded"" shtick. It was monotonous, to watch Nash as a loon from beginning to end. None of Crowe's characterizations, on second thought, show any development at all.<br/><br/>While I will concede with Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"" that I was watching an actor of some talent (though not greatly gifted), but I was watching an actor ""acting"" rather than an actor as the character (as Tom Wilkinson, who gave the most outstanding performance in English-language film this year, does in ""In The Bedroom"" -- you forget you're watching an actor acting and are watching the character himself). There is no fluidity at all in Crowe's characterization, nothing of the seamlessness of when a great actor becomes the character her plays. we're watching a cobbled-together performance, something more akin to elocution, ""gestures"" that will convey to the ordinary mass ""My -- aren't I watching 'great acting.'"" Crowe could have used semaphores (as opposed to the lazy or bored actor ""phoning in"" his performance; I supposed the audience gives extra credit for extra effort in really getting out there and ""acting"").  Crowe gives us a herky-jerky nut-case who becomes almost laughable two-thirds into the film. While watching the film, I began to think that Tom Hanks would have done a much better job with the character.<br/><br/>I have had a long-standing argument with my girlfriend over the merits of Tom Hanks as an actor -- I'm not a fan of his, she is -- but watching Crowe's ""good"" bad acting made me appreciate that Hanks is indeed a truly good actor. A hallmark of an outstanding performance is when you cannot imagine another actor in the role -- I can not only imagine other actors in the role of John Nash, but other actors giving a far better, far more believable performance than the over-hyped Russell Crowe. Apart from Hanks, Gary Oldman would have been terrific in this role. There's such a scent of ham in Crowe's characterization, all's I can think is -- if you're going to go that route, why not with the greatest slice of ham in the world -- Mr. Oldman? Gary never made it to star status and then began weighing roles by the size of his pay-cheque, but he is at heart a terrific actor, albeit a really full-bore, over-the-top one, but if that's the way the director wanted it played -- as an out and out looney tune -- why not go with a great actor that can give you a fluid performance that is not a bunch of cobbled together tics (and whose ""West Virginia"" accent wanes more than Nash's schizophrenia as portrayed in the film).<br/><br/>This film is terrible -- it makes a caricature of a genius, a caricature of someone who is mentally ill. Fifty years from now, if there still is a good ol' planet Earth, people will look back and see Crowe's unenlightened performance (as orchestrated by Opie) to be the equivalent of Step-in-Fetchit."

","I love math, and I love intelligent films about intelligent people who do intelligent things. But I don't like watching someone suffer on film. The reason I didn't give this film a higher rating was the excessive amount of time and excessive number of scenes depicting John Nash's obvious disabilities. OK , we get it; the guy is sick and suffers schizoid and paranoid delusions. So did my mother, but I tended to overlook her problems because of her wonderful outstanding qualities. They should have done the same in this film. The scenes depicting Nash's talents and accomplishments were far more inspirational than the cheesy attempts to include us in his delusions. We know he is delusional after the first few scenes with the bogeyman from the CIA or NSA. I understand these scenes are necessary to show his pain and difficulty with this afflictions, but there is no need to hammer it with extra scenes that prevent us from discovering all of the wonderful game theories and how they were discovered by Nash. Still a very impressive film, however."

"zkonedog","9","1","1","4 March 2017"," Ron Howard's Masterpiece
","Director Ron Howard has had his name attached to some pretty prestigious projects over the years, such as ""Apollo 13"", ""Cinderella Man"", and ""The Da Vinci Code"", to name but a few. ""A Beautiful Mind"", however, is (pound-for-pound) probably the best Howard-directed movie of the lot.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film looks at the life of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a brilliant (but quite eccentric) mathematician who is approached by shadowy government figure Parcher (Ed Harris) to work as a code-breaker to help expose a Soviet Union bomb plot. As Nash becomes obsessed with his work, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) begins to wonder whether or not John is truly ""working"" at all. To say any more would completely ruin the plot.<br/><br/>I could write an essay on why this movie is so great, but to do so would give away key plot details that would ruin the experience for you. Suffice it to say, though, that there are plot twists that you won't see coming even if you know that some are coming! Plus, thanks to the direction of Ron Howard, this is the kind of movie that really isn't even about the ""twist"". It is more about the extraordinary life of Mr. Nash.<br/><br/>The acting in ""A Beautiful Mind"" is also top-notch. As I've said in other reviews of movies starring Crowe, I cannot recall him EVER turning in a bad performance on screen. I mean, the same guy who can play a Gladiator in one movie and and boxer in another (""Cinderella Man"") can almost effortlessly (although I'm sure it isn't) transform himself into a much more cerebral role here. Co- stars Connelly and Harris play nice supporting roles as well, especially Connelly as Nash's wife who quite literally cannot believe what she is seeing from her husband on occasion.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""A Beautiful Mind"" to rank among my personal favorites. It has an intriguing plot, yet focuses heavily on the characters to make you really feel for them. Not only does in continue the ""Russell Crowe streak of perfection"", but it also cements Howard as a top-notch director."

","Kind of stinks.<br/><br/>There is one great scene where Crowe comes up with his economic plan by trying to pick up women at a bar....but beyond that, it sort of stinks.<br/><br/>The fault is mainly with Crowe and Connolly. Connolly has always had a hard time emoting and Crowe really only plays Crowe aide from the rare movie like ""The Insider."" The director did a great job aside of the lead, but really we have Crowe playing Crowe thinking he is the greatest actor on earth and, really, he should be playing John Nash.<br/><br/>John Nash doesn't really make an appearance in the film at all, it is all Crowe and that just doesn't work for a biopic.<br/><br/>Any other actor and it would have been as great as the fans make it out to be."
"VinayNair","9","1","1","11 May 2014"," Beautifully made
","At first glance, A Beautiful Mind is an inspiring tale about a ""genius"" mathematician who struggles with severe mental problems. And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero's most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there's the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is: a fantasy, at best and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don't expect films that are ""based on a true story"" to be 100% factual. It's impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn't movies that claim to be ""based on actual events"" seek to bear some resemblance to those ""actual events""? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash's mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It's hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe's performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn't comfortable with what we consider ""normal life."" In social circles, he's brusque and rude. Around women, he's awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the ""great ideas"" of his genius peers, calling their work ""derivative"" and declaring, ""There's not an original or innovative idea in any of it."" Nash's troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he's breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic. We root for him when he is drawn into working for a harsh and manipulative government operative (Ed Harris.) And we also root for him to overcome his social awkwardness when an admiring student (the radiant Jennifer Connelly) starts courting him. As a result, A Beautiful Mind stands apart from most Hollywood hero epics, in which we are told again and again to obey our hearts and our impulses. This story dares to suggest that the path to fulfilment and peace requires that we deny of self-destructive impulses. This is the most resonant chord in the film's dissonant symphony. At its heart, A Beautiful Mind is a parable about self-control, and about becoming a better person through the transforming of our minds.It's a shame, then, that the movie contradicts itself.For the sake of crowd pleasing, Howard abandons the thought of restraint when Nash is tempted into romance by a student named Alicia. The allure of a glamorous romance gets the better of him, and their plunge into passion is portrayed without any question about the propriety of such behaviour. Further, we are baited into cheering when Nash lashes out at those around him, because it makes for good spectacle."
"Gaitte02","9","1","1","4 May 2014"," Two stories for the price of one
","Having seen A Beautiful Mind a few times now, it never ceases to amaze me how well this movie is put together. From the writing of the screenplay to the cast and crew, this film is top caliber and worthy of all of the Oscar nominations and accolades bestowed upon it. This movie is at its best when viewed the first time, but each time after I seem to notice something that I had not before. That is the genius of this film.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard leads a talented team of actors and actresses to deliver one of my all-time favorite movies. John Nash (actor Russell Crowe) is a mathematician who is battling the debilitating mental illness, Schizophrenia. Alicia Larde (actress Jennifer Connelly) is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T), where John Nash is a professor, who falls in love with and eventually becomes his wife.<br/><br/>There actually two good stories intertwined to make A Beautiful Mind the classic that it is sure to be. The first is the life and accomplishments of Nobel Prize, for Economics, winner John Nash; the second is insight into the disease schizophrenia, and the effect it has on John and those closest to him. Similar to Teddy Daniels, Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the movie Shutter Island, this disease takes over their lives. Eventually removing the separation between reality and fantasy.<br/><br/>My first insight into the quality of this film appeared when John Nash, a self-described loner, is attending Princeton for Graduate school; he is housed with a roommate named Charles, (actor Paul Bettany). Charles is boisterous and out-going, where Nash is the serious workaholic. Charles is also a delusion of John's mental illness. Throughout his time in the film, Charles is ingrained into the scenes, whether it is playing pool or standing outside the Helinger's office, Hellinger is played by Judd Hirsch. The nuance I did not notice until the second viewing is that Charles, and similarly with the other delusions, only interacted with John Nash. Even when Marcee, Charles' niece (actress Vivien Cardone), was running around the Princeton campus chasing birds, none of the pigeons took flight in fear of her. The timing and tempo of the movie, made these characters appear as they are the same as John and Alicia themselves. It made later characters, Dr Rosen, more difficult to discern as real or not.<br/><br/>Another quality of the film that I enjoyed was the use of invisible sound. There is a point in the film where Alicia is gathering clothes from a clothes line, she hears what appears to be cryptic radio chatter. These noises appear to be coming from the inside of a small garage at rear of the property. When she goes to investigate, she discovers just how far along her husband's illness has progressed. He was supposed to be taking medication to keep his illness under control. With this discovery, she knows he has stopped taking his medications and that theirs sons life is in danger.<br/><br/>One of the more memorable moments of the film is a conversation that John has with Charles atop the roof of their dormitory at Princeton. It happens the day they find out that they are roommates; John is explaining to Charles why he isn't good with people. John tells Charles, ""The truth is, I don't much like people And they don't much like me"". Later in the conversation, they delve into why John is so driven to work as hard as he does; John states, ""find a truly original idea. It's the only way to distinguish myself. Only way to truly matter"". To me, those are very powerful insights about John Nash. The fact that he is having this conversation with a person created from his illness is telling to the seriousness of his disorder. John graduates Princeton and gets a job, teaching at the Wheeler Lab, on the campus of M.I.T. During his time there, he is contracted to do cryptography work for the Department of Defense (DoD). After finishing one of his jobs decrypting Russian code, John meets Parcher (actor Ed Harris). Parcher seeks Johns help decrypting more Russian code to help foil a plot to detonate a mobile nuclear device on US soil. Parcher, like Charles, is a product of John's schizophrenia. Where Charles seemed to befriend John, Parcher seemed to use patriotism and fear to get Nash to do what he needed him to do.<br/><br/>Eventually, with the help of Alicia and Dr. Rosen (actor Christopher Plummer) John comes to realize that Chalres, Marcee and Parcher are not flesh and blood, but part of his illness. This is the turning point in the lives of John and Alicia. Up to this point, John has been in denial of the diagnosis from Dr. Rosen, even so far as to claim Dr. Rosen is a Russian doctor trying to silence him. John almost drowns his son in the bath tub, claiming that Charles was watching him; then he shows Alicia out of the way as he thinks Parcher is about to shoot her for treason. When faced with a return to the mental hospital for more treatment, John tells Alicia that he now knows that these people are not real, he explains to her, ""I know they are not real, Marcee never ages"".<br/><br/>Through all of the highs and lows that are John Nash's life, there is Russell Crowe giving a superb performance. All of the symptomatic subtleties, from the unusual walk to the way he talks and averts his eyes; Russell Crowe is most deserved of his Oscar nomination. His portrayal, of both, John Nash and of a man battling a mental illness would be worthy of a nomination for either performance."

His work for the government was classified, therefore not even his wife Alicia knew what his work involved.

","John Nash arrives at Princeton University because of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship for mathematics. Nash comes under increasing pressure to publish, but he refuses until he finds a truly original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates ""every man for himself"", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. This leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which Nash develops and publishes. On the strength of this he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns. He meets Alicia and marries while working at the US Department. Throughout this time he develops his schizophrenia and imagines people created by his mind. Alicia finds out that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia investigates and finally confronts Nash.<br/><br/>Nash is the life and inspiration of this movie. He is a dramatic character and interesting. One wonders if the voices one hears is what he heard. I recommend this movie and to understand it deeply watch it more than once."

In no way should this film have snagged the BEST PICTURE OSCAR. In fact, the best picture SHOULD have gone to LORD OF THE RINGS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING instead.<br/><br/>In the beginning of A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I found myself thinking, `Wow, this really IS going to be good!' Because I, myself, thought RUSSELL CROWE shouldn't have won best actor for GLADIATOR 2 years ago, and now I was thinking that this'll make up for that. Wrong! After Crowe's character starts becoming paranoid-an effect of schizophrenia, the movie just got weird. Something about it just was out of place, and though I know this film is based on the real JOHN NASH, I personally feel RON HOWARD messed up chances at possible good film. Among many other weird sequences with his `friends,'  at the end of the film, though it may be a true story, I actually felt depressed-the OPPOSITE of what Ron said he tried to create at the end. I felt that out of his whole lifetime, all he did, all the terror  All John Nash got was one Nobel Prize?. And the other weird thing is, that he STILL sees those people -- the man, the girl and the spy. While this may be true, I got more of a horror vibe at this thought, rather than a ` wow, what an accomplishment.' Ron could've presented this fact better than showing an 80 year old Nash, walking the college floors, and peering behind him, revealing the people, still standing there. I got a very, very weird feeling seeing this.<br/><br/>The movie itself, wasn't that great either. Sure, it's good material, but not Oscar worthy! Jennifer Connelly didn't do that great at acting in this film, either. She did better in THE LABYRINTH! Don't take me wrong, this film's good, but not Oscar worthy. And like I said before, this film feels more like a horror picture than anything else, much less a drama! See it, like it, whatever. But don't tell me it deserved an Oscar. Why does everyone like Ron Howard films? All I've REALLY likes so far were APOLLO 13 and RANSOM. Other than that they're okay. NOT Oscar worthy though. This year's Academy Awards were given to the wrong people, and pictures. I'm sorry, but that's just my view of this film. Sue me, but I'll let you know, I'm giving A BEAUTIFUL MIND a good rating, just not a great one. 3/5 stars-If you've got some points to point out, r just to say something about a movie I reviewed, or even to agree with me, you can email me."

"rmax304823","6","4","9","7 January 2003"," Not bad
","For generations people on the street have believed that ""genius is linked to insanity"" and for generations psychiatrists have denied that there was any connection. <br/><br/>John Nash is one of the reasons the belief is popular. He suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Unlike major mood disorders (depression, mania) it tends not to come and go -- just to come and hang around. It's a devastating disease, affecting as it does the very organ that makes us what we are. And the side effects of treatment are not to be lightly dismissed.<br/><br/>John Nash was a very lucky guy. His search for patterns is rather typical, but his finding REAL ones, that is patterns that exist outside his own mind, is unusual. The surprising thing about his case is not that he recovered but that over the years he managed to climb out of the abyss and find a position with which he felt comfortable. Insofar as this is a success story, it's pretty unusual.<br/><br/>Ron Howard belongs to a group of relatively young directors -- Penny Marshall, James Brooks, Rob Reiner are some others -- that tend to take on stories that aren't excessively demanding or quirky. There may be troubles, but the endings are uplifting or heartwarming. This is that kind of story. It follows the trajectory we associate with sports biographies. Hero shows early promise, is struck down by demons during his career, overcomes demons and is apotheosized. That's pretty much the case here. Nash's winning the Nobel is kind of like Redford hitting that final game-saving home run in ""The Natural."" <br/><br/>Like Einstein, Nash was awarded the prize for work he'd done earlier in his life. Math and physics are tricky fields. If you haven't made it by the time you're thirty, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>But if the story isn't especially uncommon some other things about the movie are. The integration of Nash's hallucinations with his ""real"" experiences. This is always tough to do on screen. The fantasy figures in ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" are both frighteningly unreal and obvious. But here the viewer doesn't find out until the movie is half over that some of the characters he's gotten to know are productions of Nash's mind. And they're warm and comforting too, we can can understand their appeal. <br/><br/>Once or twice they are a bit ""overlogical"" too. When his wife is trying to leave him, Nash hallucinates a little girl he'd first seen years ago, realizes that she hasn't grown any older, and that she therefore isn't real. Hallucinations don't work in such a reasonable manner. That's the kind of insight that a screenwriter might dream up. <br/><br/>The movie also is a bit weak in conveying the kind of deterioration in personal care that accompanies schizophrenia. Most patients aren't pretty. They are suffering and it shows in their bad teeth, their mismatched clothes, and carelessly groomed hair.<br/><br/>Still, within these limits, the movie is pretty good, the acting especially. It's easy to gain praise for playing the role of a deviant. You can win awards for it (cf., ""Charlie,"" ""Rain Man,"" et al.) But for the first time, Russell Crowe does a fine job of suggesting a genuine personality behind that dimly comprehending physical bulk. He actually comes up with a real performance as the young Nash. And it only improves as he gets older. <br/><br/>One of the long-term effects of antipsychotic drugs is a set of twitchy movements called tardive dyskinesia. A good example of this is given after his return to Princeton, when he waddles along the campus and some kids mimic him from behind and laugh. (Ron Howard had the good taste not to turn incidents like this into moments of heartbreaking, tearjerking, hankywetting, blubbering, lachrymos pathos. Some directors would have done exactly that.)<br/><br/>There is also the case of Jennifer Connoly. (Wow.) She's hardly recognizable as the innocent, open-lipped waif that she was in, say, ""Hot Spot."" She's a full-blown woman now, her face filled out and her jaw somewhat hardened, although she has the same girlish voice. Like Brooke Shields she has changed over the years from an adolescent of Kewpie-doll beauty whom any normal man would want to squeeze and bite into a more mature but still strikingly beautiful creature. It's hard to tell whether she is much of an actress. She hasn't had any truly challenging roles. Her movements are languid. They flow like silk. That could be a limitation.<br/><br/>Well, see this movie. You may think you've had it bad, but Nash had it worse. For most of us, alas, there is not much of a Prize at the end."

"Alex-506","5","4","9","24 March 2002"," Overrated, standard fare.
","Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind, which I just witnessed win Best Picture, is middle-brow, typical fare.  It is most definitely not Howard's best work (that would be Apollo 13, in my opinion).  While Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance, Russell Crowe has been a lot better.  Yet this is the kind of performance people often fall for, giving credit to the role's challenges than to the actual connection we have to the actor.  Yes, Crowe is techincally excellent (although his accent slides a little).  But is it a performance that inspires us or reflects ourselves?  I think not.  Crowe's performance was nowhere near the level of Tom Wilkinson in In The Bedroom.<br/><br/>There are some pluses to the film: The aforementioned solid acting, a genuine attempt to put into cinematic terms the mind-boggling (pardon the pun) disease of schizophrenia (which someone in my own family suffers from). Although the film has been attacked by those who say that Nash's life hasn't been put into accurate context, my question is: who cares?  You don't seen biopics for hard facts unless you are a fool.  Just look at Nixon, Raging Bull, and others.  As long as the film itself is effective in portraying its character, that's all that matters.  A Beautiful Mind also contains some great moments.  My favourite is when Jennifer Connelly lets out one instant of frustration, smashing the glass in the bathroom.  It is so shocking and emerges from such quiet that the effect is quite profound.<br/><br/>But the problems outweigh the strengths.  Some complaints:<br/><br/>1.  The musical score is atrocious.  I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar.  It is saccharine, violin-heavy, tearjerking and shameless.<br/><br/>2.  The disease of schizophrenia is grossly simplified.  The fact that Crowe has these three characters who are so clearly obvious in what aspect of his psyche that they represent is a cheap trick.<br/><br/>3.  The second half of the film becomes grossly repetitive.  We see Crowe walking, we see his POV of either Big Brother or his roommate or the little girl, and then he continues on in the face of his disease.  There were about SEVEN scenes like this.  I was growing bored...<br/><br/>4.  There are too many Hollywood moments.  The little musical chord that strikes when we first see an aged Crowe and Connelly (Oh...how touching...they're still together after all of these years).  And worse is the episode with a beautiful woman that inspires Crowe to come up with his mathematic theory.<br/><br/>5.  The mathematic theory isn't explained in nearly enough detail.  We are only told that Nash's work ""changed modern economics"".  Howard doesn't trust that the audience has the patience or the intelligence to be told how.<br/><br/>6.  Back to the Hollywood moments.  I hate it in movies when we see something happen to a character in their twenties, and then this resonates while they are in their sixties.  We have just seen these things happen a few hours ago.  They happened a lifetime ago for the characters.  I know we remember some things forever, but A Beautiful Mind really stretched this effect.  Examples: the hankerchief that Alicia gives John, the phrase ""petrified, stupified, etc."" that John mocks his friend/adversary with when offered to play a game, and the full-circle effect of John receiving all the pens in that special room where he had once been snubbed.  (How touching...pass the hankerchief).  John may have been so deeply imprinted with rejection when he saw another man receiving the tribute, so it is possible that this would still have some resonance.  But the hankerchief is a typical Howardian Hollywood ploy.  And are we really supposed to believe that John remembers the exact order of words that he said to a man who offered to play a game with him FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO!!!!  Give me a break.<br/><br/>I am not a cynic who doesn't like feel-good movies.  But the movies have to earn it, and A Beautiful Mind did not.  There are too many flaws in this picture to recommend it.  Rather, I would give it about a 60/100.  This continues a poor and long stretch of mistakes by the Academy in handing out the Best Picture (excluding Schindler's List and American Beauty).  Of the last TWELVE Best Picture winners, I have only really enjoyed four: the aforementioned Schindler's List and American Beauty (my two favourite films of all-time), Unforgiven and Forrest Gump.  Is something wrong with me?  Or is it the Academy?  Obviously, you know what I think."

The first half of the film seems to be a comedy, but the last half is a depressing clichéd drama. The film itself seems to be schizophrenic (even manic-depressive).<br/><br/>There is very little that is original or innovative in _A Beautiful Mind_ [that is unless you consider reorganization of main characters mid-film innovative]. Furthermore, the answers provided by the film to questions of epistemology [nature of and limits of knowledge] and questions of existence [answers] are merely hackneyed drivel.<br/><br/>Both _The Matrix_ and _Sixth Sense_ do a far better job of asking the same questions and providing answers.<br/><br/>I do, on the other hand, concede that the acting in _A Beautiful Mind_ is worthy of praise. Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly do a marvelous job of bailing out an otherwise sinking ship. However, this movie does _not_ merit the Academy Award for Best Picture--an award usually reserved for a balanced film (acting and plot) [sort of a 'best-of-show' award]."

"wes-connors","8","3","6","23 December 2008"," You Do the Math
","By the time Russell Crowe (as John Nash) married Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia), I had serious concerns about ""A Beautiful Mind"". My first question revolved around Mr. Crowe's Princeton roommate, Paul Bettany (as Charles). I could not understand why Mr. Bettany did not pal around with the college bar crowd. Crowe was there, with a group of other students, but no mixing with Bettany. Why? Obviously, Bettany loved to imbibe; so, he should have been the life of the party, I thought. With that question nagging me, I continued to have questions. Like was up with the two men at the later party? I wonderedÂ… <br/><br/>Then, the final straw - Crowe uses his secret ""code"" to open a security gate; and, the gate swings open without closing behind him. This was not a very secure gate. Anyone wanting to gain admittance would only have to wait for Crowe to open it up, and walk in after him (if not climb in ahead of him). And, why wasn't Bettany at the Crowe's wedding? <br/><br/>Just when I was wondering how to get in touch with director Ron Howard, the truth dawned on me. I was expecting a more traditional film. A couple of surreal moments should have tipped me off; for example, Crowe's barroom deduction concerning the students' chances of ""picking up"" a blonde women. Still, I didn't fully appreciate what was going on. Was the rollicking car chase with Ed Harris (as Parcher) supposed to be an illusion? <br/><br/>Then, I wondered about the characters ""Charles"" and ""Marcee"". I understood ""Parcher"" as a manifestation of ""cold war"" paranoia. But, I do not understand what, precisely, ""Charles"" and ""Marcee"" reveal about the title character, other than a propensity for creating illusions. The three imaginary characters are the most important in Nash's life - maybe if I knew what they were around for, they'd go away. Eventually, the film confirms suspicions. <br/><br/>I can almost see clearly now.<br/><br/>******** A Beautiful Mind (2001) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany"

Never quite ""fitting in"", the young Nash developed not one, but 3 imaginary ""friends"" who haunted him far beyond the point when he realized they were hallucinations.<br/><br/>With his ""condition"" climaxing during the Korean War Era, with the Cold War on everyones mind, Nash was obsessed with the idea of being a government spy whose Mathematical genius and natural talent for ""cracking codes"" was invaluable to the CIA. Decades later, the once arrogant graduate student, now an accomplished PhD Professor, is honored by his peers for his enlightening findings in the field of Mathematics, which changed the world of Science forever. Receiving the Nobel Prize in 1994, Nash gives credit for all of his accomplishments to his wife, and cites that true love is greater than any science.<br/><br/>The VHS video features an additional documentary of about 20 minutes, looking behind the scenes of making this film. The real John Nash was interviewed, as was his long suffering wife who saved him from self destruction.<br/><br/>A remarkable life story, however a less remarkable film. Embellished accounts of facts to assure drama, along with many comments on the treatment of mental patients in the 1950s (still considered the dark ages of mental health), this could easily be condensed into a 60 minute ""NOVA"" video at a fraction of the production cost.

","From what I've seen and heard, John Forbes Nash has achieved and been through enough in his live to fill an interesting movie with. Unfortunately, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not that movie.

On the surface level, everything is OK. The acting is fine (Ed Harris once again steals the show), the atmosphere is authentic, and the movie is beautifully shot.<br/><br/>This makes it a real shame that they didn't do anything more with the story. Instead of a complex story about real people, we get a simplified tale full of one-dimensional over-glorified characters (Jennifer Connelly is too nice to believe), a simplistic message (""love conquers all"") and corny dialog.

","I really love Happy Days. There's something about Richie, Pottsie, Malph, the Fonze, and all the Cunninghams that just causes all of my aversions to sugar-coated Americana switch off. I cannot tolerate the Brady Bunch, Leave It to Beaver, Full House, etc, but a half-hour of Happy Days is pure television genius. I can't really explain why this is, but I surmise that I've always detected that, on some level, Happy Days didn't believe the myths it spun. It understood that the era it depicted was not all peaches and cream; there was something dark underneath all those episodes.<br/><br/>Those other shows, those happy-family sit-coms, seem to believe their mythic landscapes and I cannot abide them for that. Or something.<br/><br/>Well, as you all know, little Richie grew up and became a reasonably successful film director and produced, among others, A Beautiful Mind. And, man, does it make me yearn for Happy Days.<br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure why this film has been un-necessarily given the title of genius. It's really just another Hollywood bio-pic and, if I'm not mistaken, there have been very few of those that were worthwhile (Ed Wood, for example, or Baadasssss! or Auto Focus). Nevertheless, come February and March, they take home all sorts of little gold statuettes.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe offers another fine (though not Best Actor nomination worthy) performance as John Nash, schizophrenic genius extraordinaire, while Ed Harris proves again that he should receive more leading roles. He's one of the few character actors left in Hollywood who can waltz into any movie and instantly improve the film's quality. He was by far the finest point in the Hours and he's equally excellent here, yet again supplying the high-point in an otherwise mediocre movie (Truman Show and the aforementioned Hours anyone?). The remaining performances struck me as rather bland, as did the direction, and score.<br/><br/>The only other bright spot for me were occasional flashes of cinematographic brilliance supplied by Mr. Roger Deakins, who, though not at the top of his game, provided us with something better, at least, than his nadir thus far - O Brother Where Art Thou.<br/><br/>To be honest, though John Nash is certainly an important figure and has provided many important discoveries, I seriously question the need to give him his own film. Most great bio-pics serve a higher purpose than to worship the life they depict, offering the audience insight into something other than a so-called genius. A Beautiful Mind strives to do this, providing us with a glimpse into the world of mental illness, but ultimately the movie fails in this.<br/><br/>The movie ultimately is not about schizophrenia; it's about John Nash. I like my bio-pics the other way around; I like them to be about something and not about an individual or group (take Ed Wood, for example - a film not about one of the most interesting Hollywood figures, but rather about the under-side of Hollywood - the B-picture and the effects of Hollywood upon the stars it made famous and threw away) All in all, this was a mediocre film, not worth the attention it received and certainly not worth the $9 I gave them to see it in the theaters.

","Once again, Hollywood comes out with a film that strains the limits of credibility in order to make the viewer the happy man who walks out of the theatre feeling that love conquers all. This film is highly overrated although not altogether unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, right from the very beginning, I didn't believe much of the script that later had the rug pulled out of it in ""Shylamanian"" style. Some of the surprises were telecast right from the beginning and made for somewhat awkward scenes. Crowe's Virginia accent changes considerably over the film and the image of his buff physique should not have been shown, which in my mind made him the furthest thing from resembling a mathematician. But I'm whining here... let's get to why this film is truly overrated although not unwatchable.<br/><br/>The script was incredibly poor. A love story develops with almost no perceptible verbal chemistry on screen. Usually characters have to interact and the character and audience needs to be won over, not just by sensuality and a clever line or two. There is little explanation as to WHY Nash's wife saw something in him more than most who supposedly didn't like him at all (although everyone seemed to enjoy his company at Princeton too, except for one or two tough scenes -- odd.) Neither did I feel the viewer get the sense that the math genius could do the impossible in the manner he does -- look at a roomful of numbers, no pencil, no calculations, nothing -- and simply breaks codes with the aid of some cheesy Hollywood special effects ""mesmerizing"" your mind. Please, this more resembled Superman than it did a genius mathematician. It asks you, the viewer, to connect the dots you know you have to make since the script doesn't do it for you at all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie continues to strain credibility, especially the family troubles. The lack of other characters assisting in that difficult situation was odd, unexplained (where are their parents), and made me wonder just how much fantasy this movie was based. Apparently, the words ""based on a true story"" is an understatement as Nash's true story doesn't quite resemble this glorified, Hollywood heart candy. I didn't get much sense of struggle -- the problems encountered were simply passed over quickly. Everyone sticks around to help Dr. Nash, to ends that just were simply not the manner in which people act.<br/><br/>Is the movie altogether bad? No. In fact, there is quite a bit that is very good with the movie, such as excellent performance by Russell Crowe and an equally good and sultry performance by Jennifer Connelly, who does the best she can with a mediocre script. This is a good rental but don't go in expecting to be blown away with it's overhyped rating. It's your typical Hollywood fare that glamorizes and airbrushes the lives of people who should have faced serious adversity for fear that you might not want to go to the movies if you don't come out feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. In an era of incredibly weak film-making efforts, this film rises to the top of a mediocre heap."

","May I first say what a fine addition this movie will make to Lifetime's library of theatrical motion pictures. Ah, how I look forward to seeing this garbage every three months for the rest of my life on 'television for women'. P-yooo, what a stinker! I knew I was in trouble when James Horner's score started a whole minute before the credits--I had to endure endless logo reels from Universal, Dreamworks (a real bladder-buster) and Imagine before the credits even began. And what's the first credit card on screen? Universal Dreamworks Imagine present! Talk about ego!<br/><br/>To paraphrase a character in the movie, both Ron Howard's treacly direction and Akiva Goldsman's simplistic script are both WITLESS and OBVIOUS. This is nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before on a Sunday night on CBS. Whatever quality this movie may possess rests solely on the shoulders of Russell Crowe. His dedicated performance is the glue that holds this gooey mish-mash together from start to finish. (Though, I must confess, I won't lose any sleep if Denzel Washington wins the Oscar this year.) Crowe rises above the mostly temporarily-tepid talents of everyone around him to make every scene he's in at least appear to be trenchant. I can only guess that it is Crowe's unflinching energy throughout that is giving life to the ridiculous critical attention this movie as a whole has attained in recent months. Yet when Crowe is off the screen, we remember just how stuck we are in yet another TV disease-movie-of-the-week. Regarding Jennifer Connelly's performance, oft-lauded of late, let me say this: I'll be the first to admit that both she and her role fit like a hand-in-glove; which is to say, how fortunate it was of Ron Howard to find a two-dimensional actress to portray a two-dimensional character.<br/><br/>Anachronisms abound in this movie, particularly in the dialogue. And where did that huge budget go? A couple of Packards and an old Olivetti? And for some reason, the makeup has been nominated for an Oscar. What braniac on the makeup staff forget to fill in Adam Goldberg's huge earring holes? (I guess his character likes to play pirates on the weekend.) But the most egregious faults of this film lay in Goldsman's cheesy love-conquers-all approach and outrageous alteration of the facts. A disclaimer at the end of the movie states that ""...a number of incidents have been fictionalized..."". A number?! Not ""some"". Not ""a few"". But ""a number""? Okay, how about...uh...82? That's a number. That the producers would purport for a moment that this movie bears anything close to the truth is a crime in itself. And the attitude that hand-holding, bear-hugs and doe-eyes is a valid treatment for a severe mental illness is an insult to one's intelligence. They would have you believe that WUV cures EVERYTHING: schizophrenia, typhoid, lupus, psoriasis, herpes, dandruff, you name it.<br/><br/>That this movie would even for a moment be considered a potential member of a pantheon of pictures which includes ""On The Waterfront"", ""The Godfather"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is terrifying to imagine. Any one of the other four Best Picture Oscar-nominees this year is superior in every respect to this emperor-with-no-clothes. I'm not kidding--if this dreck wins, I'm off movies for the rest of my life."

"Quinoa1984","8","5","13","25 December 2001"," A Splendid job turned in by Crowe and Howard
","Ron Howard brings forth one of his best and most serious films to date, A Beautiful Mind.  It examines a mathematical wizard named John Forbes Nash Jr. who created a discovery in game theory that is still used today for a number of things.  But the film isn't so much about math (what film is?) as it is about the man's struggles with a disease in his mind that drives him to madness yet somehow is able to try and fight it to the best of his abilities, which aren't always as high as they could be.  This man is played by Russell Crowe who gives another top shelve performance to add with The Insider, L.A. Confidential and Romper Stomper (Gladiator I don't really count as a top shelve performance), and he plays Mr. Nash so well it doesn't need to be thought that he's immitating him as much as being him. <br/><br/>
Crowe's Nash starts off in the film at Princeton university where he wants to distinguish himself with an original idea and soon comes up with one that defies 150 years of mathematical practice.  Things look good, especially since he starts dating a graduate student (Jennifer Connelly in an Oscar caliber performance to be sure) who is smitten with him.  But then things start to get troublesome- Nash is asked by a member of the defense depot to break codes that could be in newspapers, magazines, etc to help out the government.  Soon he feels paranoid the Russians are after him, and this leads him into a mental hospital (under Christopher Plummer's care) where he learns the entire consipracy is in his head (schitzophrenia).  Then the plot thickens as Nash battles with his disease, medication or not.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's almost too much, but Howard delivers overall a great and compelling tale throughout nevertheless and Crowe shines (the rest of the cast, real or not, are also quite credible) with all the talent he has. Grade: A+ or A."
"moonspinner55","7","4","10","20 July 2007"," Though designed to be prestigious, the beauty does manage to come through
","In retrospect, it isn't surprising that Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture: it's a sentimental and yet highly dramatic package which takes a time-worn theme for the movies (mental illness) and gives it a few new twists (the Academy normally frowns on edgy concepts--this one has an old-fashioned set-up and a lead performance preconceived to be a triumph, yet it has a toughness to its narrative which feels very modern). In 1947 Princeton, mathematician John Nash is flailing away at an economics theory while all his male classmates just want to get laid (the film equates the average Princeton male with the type of guys typical to ""Happy Days""); five years later, Nash is working with the Pentagon on numerical formation patterns and appears to be pulled into a conspiracy plot to thwart the Russians from detonating their H-Bomb on American soil. The film has a rocky first hour, with Howard indeed setting up the plot mechanisms but also giving us a main character who is disconnected, a failure at social interaction, and a really bad first date (future-wife Jennifer Connelly doesn't escape easily herself, and she's stuck with dim thoughts such as ""God must be a painter, why else would there be so many colors?""). Still, by the second act, Nash's personal crisis has become more clear to us, more involving and gripping, and Russell Crowe isn't so much deliberately one-note as he is intensely focused (the actorly tics come later, yet when they do they are almost endearing). The film has that slick look of ""grand entertainment""--designed to win awards--but there are miraculous moments: Nash neglecting to take his medicine and discovering an entire covert operation going down in his backyard shed; Nash, recuperating, riding his bicycle in an infinity pattern, scribbling numbers in the air with his finger. The mental institution stuff is the cinematic equivalent of treading water (and wastes Christopher Plummer as a doctor), but the last half of the film is quite good: a brilliant but disturbed professor working his damnedest to overcome his demons, helped along by a loving woman, and receiving the kind of respect he never dreamed of. Sentimental? Yes, but I don't believe it's dishonest sentiment. Ron Howard isn't always graceful or sensitive (especially in the electric shock sequence), but he does resurrect a tired genre and ultimately makes it a moving experience. *** from ****"

The Godfather), but this movie could have been an hour shorter.  I heard reviews saying it would 'change the way you look at the world.'  That is insane!  I saw this movie and forgot about it until it started to sweep the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe gives a terrible unbelievable performance!  I have always thought Crowe was a good actor but the fact he was a shoe-in for best actor...  It's obvious the Academy cares more about the production than the performances.  Jennifer Connelly won best supporting actress.  It's a shame because she wasn't a SUPPORTING actress, she was lead.  And as for her performance, it was so-so.  Nothing special to it.<br/><br/>Besides not deserving best picture and best supporting actress it also did NOT deserve best director.  Ron Howard should have given his nomination to Baz Luhrman.  Ridley Scott did a fantastic job recreating a war.  Baz Luhrman imagined Moulin Rouge.  Peter Finch took us on an trip I can't explain to you.  I think every director nominated for 2001 desereved more than Ron Howard, who simply gave us a boring movie with a big name star.<br/><br/>In the end A Beautiful Mind will go down as a weak pick for best picture (A beautiful mind over Memento... please).<br/><br/>*2/10*"
"MOscarbradley","5","3","7","18 July 2007"," A load of bull
","This hugely over-praised film was not only flavour of the month, it was flavour of the year and it went on to win the Academy Award as the year's best picture. The fact that it isn't really very good didn't seem to matter; it made mathematics sexy in the form of Russell Crowe as the real life mathematician and paranoid-schizophrenic John Nash and it conformed to Hollywood's idea of paranoid-schizophrenia, (fantasy characters that the audience sees just the way John sees them; a charismatic star who can overact all over the place but with whom the audience can empathize). Actually, Crowe isn't half bad, especially in the first half of the film before the madness really takes hold. Once it does it's all stops out and the script doesn't really help; there are no subtleties or shadings to it. When the pieces fall into place the film seems alarmingly conventional.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard can't resist sentimentalizing everything so the film isn't so much about John Nash, 'the beautiful mind' of the title. but how a sick man is cured by the love of a beautiful woman. If the film wasn't based on fact it would be utterly unbelievable. In reality, of course, Hollywood altered the facts leaving out key events in Nash's life, (his bisexuality, for example, is never touched on), in the name of 'entertainment'.<br/><br/>Ironically the two best performances come from the actors Ed Harris and Paul Bettany who play the imaginary characters while Jennifer Connelly's much praised turn as the self-sacrificing wife never really escapes the confines of the role. This is self-sacrifice taken to the extreme and she was given the Oscar for her trouble.<br/><br/>There are a lot of people who find this film highly entertaining though I would doubt if anyone would find it profound. When Nash wins the Nobel Prize his speech is pure Hollywood drivel: just like the Oscars, in fact."
"bm4972","1","3","7","28 January 2007"," Perhaps the most overrated big Hollywood movie ever
","First of all, let me say that the featured comment on this movie cracks me up. ""A movie with a difference - It's realistic""? Ha. This movie is hardly realistic. It totally misrepresents the nature of Nash's delusions, and it criminally oversimplifies how game theory works. For example, schizophrenics never experience visual hallucinations, only auditory hallucinations, and Nash's delusions were hardly as quasi-patriotic and noble as the movie made them seem.<br/><br/>This is your typical Hollywood movie, but perhaps because the eponymous mind was so brilliant, the movie has intellectual delusions of grandeur. Sure, the tolerably good plot makes it watchable, but this movie continually irritated me all the way through, primarily because it maintained a constant ponderous gravitas in an apparent attempt to suggest that there is some profound meaning deeper than the movie's plot. And that meaning just isn't there. The movie's huge mathematical, psychiatric, and biographical distortions were also frustrating. Competent acting and production are this movie's only redeeming qualities; the script is heavy, condescending, pretentious, and shallow. An awful, pretentious movie with no depth."

I have never seen as self-centered performance as Russell Crowe's.  Throughout the entire movie he might as well be saying ""I'm going to win an Oscar for playing this freak.  HA!""  He has no respect for the amazing man that he is playing, you can see that in his incredibly cliched movements that look like he read a book about what crazy people do, marked exactly where he was going to do these movements, and then executed them without thinking if this is the right time or if it makes sense for the character to do them then.  I was so relieved when he did not win the Oscar, but I didn't think Denzel Washington's performance in Training Day was all that spectacular, but it was more of a career award for him.  Russell Crowe, however, has had a career about as impressive as a box of hair.  Jennifer Connelly was just okay.  I didn't see anything spectacular or Oscar-worthy in her performance, she just sort of screamed and looked worried and disheveled.

The story was, for the most part, predictable and not involving.  I won't even go into the many, many inaccuracies in the film.  The entire time I found myself just wishing the movie would end.<br/><br/>First of all, Russell Crowe was far from convincing as a genius.  His accent was beyond inconsistent and he never, not for even the smallest moment, convinced me that he WAS John Nash.  I can find solace in the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for this overrated performance.  It's a shame they can't take back the one they gave him last year.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly was decent in a role that I, among others, feel should not have been categorized as supporting.  Either way, it wasn't even the best supporting performance of the year.  That prize should have gone to Marisa Tomei.  I think Connelly is a very fine actress and if she deserved an Oscar it was for her performance in Requiem for a Dream in 2000.  She wasn't even nominated for that.  What a travesty.  But I digress...<br/><br/>I saw nothing in the movie that would have warranted a Best Director nod for Ron Howard either.  He's a capable director, but this was nowhere near an Oscar-worthy job.  Take a look at what David Lynch did in Mulholland Dr. or what Christopher Nolan did in Memento or even Ridley Scott in Black Hawk Down.  These are examples of greatness.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is not an example of greatness.  It is an over-hyped, overrated, piece of fluff trying to sell itself as something meaningful.

The beautiful cinematography, musical score, and close-ups all work to create, like a formula, the illusion of feeling.  The audience sees (close-up + sad music + frustrated Russel Crowe = sad reaction).  Ron Howard provided the audience with all of the trappings they expect to see in an Oscar-calibre film and most moviegoing audiences have been trained to believe that slow-motion and nice cinematogrgraphy are the elements that make a good film.  Yet, this film completely lacks the kind of character development and true inner conflict that thrives in a film like Monster's Ball.  It is a veneer and never even attempts to get below the surface.  Ron Howard went fishing for an Oscar and got two.  The fact that Howard won an Oscar is embarrasing.

","A Beautiful Mind does many things right: smooth, professional aesthetics, a solid story, and an interesting well developed character, John Nash (Crowe).  I did however have one major problem with the film-- the characterization of Alicia, Nash's wife.<br/><br/>Although Jennifer Connelly may have ""acted"" well, I found her character highly problematic.  How could a smart, beautiful woman (studying at MIT) who seems so normal not have any qualms or relational problems with her husband?  Why, in the first place, would she be attracted to someone who appears twenty years older than her (whether he is or not), who is her teacher, and ultimately, a dork.   Even if the disbelief is suspended in considering the nuptials, why would she stay loyally at his side through all his psycho tendencies, and on top of that, not have any suspicion that she married a schizophrenic? Although this 'dream girl' of the movies may work in less respectable films or comedies, I was disappointed to find such stereotypical characterization in a serious, critically acclaimed film.    I'm sorry, but I've never met anyone like this.<br/><br/>Part of the problem with her characterization I think stems from two ""Hollywoodisms"" to the adaptation: first, omitting the complex and confusing nature of Nash's love life (i.e. the period of homosexuality) in an effort to make the film mainstream friendly, and secondly, the technique of making his schizophrenia appear real for the first half of the film (ala Sixth Sense).  I don't think the film needed to address his homosexuality, but it did need to acknowledge and deal with his complexity in a sexual relationship, and the identity crisis that accompanies it.  His relationship with his wife, however, becomes too stable, too simple, and too easy. Yes she cries towards the end, and may get upset, but where are the problems in their relationship earlier, does this woman have a major issue with denial?  The stunt of not having his condition apparent for the first half of the film further complicates the character Alicia, as she also must be unaware of his condition for this portion of the film.  In reality, however, how could one be?<br/><br/>My final criticism is that the pacing was too slow, but I won't rip the film apart any more.  I was just disappointed that such a rich characterization of an interesting man had to be sandwiched with plot candy and typical Hollywood notions of women.<br/><br/>Brooke"

How original. Nash's violent temper and bi-sexuality were almost completely disregarded, or sanitised, and the ending was puke-makingly sugary. The film has one, and only one, redeeming feature: Crowe has done it again. For all his odiousness as a person, he has managed a fine performance.

Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely powerful as the confused and confusing Nash. Although the marquee says ""Russell Crowe"", you'll immediately forget this is the hunky guy from Gladiator. I mean after all, he's playing some nerdy scientist dude! But Crowe completely disappears in the role, and he's unforgettable. Actors kill for roles like this one, because it gives them a chance to show off their acting chops. For many actors, this is the kiss of death, because then they're exposed as poor thespians. But not for Crowe; if anything, this proves once and for all that he's a grand master of acting. I realize that sounds like overkill for him, but I think that when actors are labeled as a ""hunk"" - their skills as actors aren't seen as very substantial. Hey, looking darn good worked against Tom Selleck, and to a degree it has worked against Crowe as well.<br/><br/>And he ages well, too. The movie takes place over a fairly extended period of time, ending with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize in 1994. The makeup on Nash is neither garish nor schmaltzy; he looks completely genuine. And that's the essence of Crowe's performance. It's sincere, never trying to win over the audience with a sly wink here or a toss of the hair there. Crowe shows remarkable poise, elegance, and is utterly astounding in the role.<br/><br/>His supporting cast is more than able. Jennifer Connelly is better than I thought she would be; in most roles, she's the eye candy. But this role had meat to it, and she held her own. It wasn't an easy role to play, and she pulled it off. And her scenes with Crowe do have that movie magic that each of us looks for when we go to movies, that one moment, that compatible chemistry that leaves audiences mesmerized.<br/><br/>And yes, this does have some very, very touching moments. The final scene, while predictable (even if you don't know the outcome in real life), will bring more than one tear to the eye. Yes, I'll admit it, it got me right here. But it's okay; I did that old 'guy-crying-in-movie-theater' trick. If you feel the brime falling from the lid, you make a motion toward your cheek and then you scratch vigorously; people might think you have a skin infection and move away slowly, but at least they won't think you're a girly man.<br/><br/>At any rate, it's certainly one of the best movies of the year. Everything's in place: the direction, the photography, and especially the acting."

It was not until he successfully challenged the game theory of his predecessors that old friends admired him and became good friends with him. In other words, it was his achievement that changed the way others viewed him. The Nobel Prize can only be achieved with success.

","Perhaps genius and neuropathy are only separated by a line. In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like ""a beautiful eve"" is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV shows have created a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic desire for the group of highly intelligent businessmen.
But there is no doubt that geniuses are also people, and their human emotions also need to be satisfied. Therefore, most of this type of film will return to human nature after touting genius, and eventually realize the universal significance of the film on its redemption road.<br/><br/>""A beautiful eve"" can also be regarded as a discussion of fame and fortune to a certain extent. The opening remark is a heated text in the style of ""Youth China"", so that the future of each motherland present feels that if it has not been opened before death It's shameful to pass. This kind of strong utilitarian suggestion has to say that it has deeply influenced Nash's life trajectory to a great extent, making him eager to become famous, and he is willing to do everything he can, as long as this society affirms him. William Parcher is such an existence. He appeared at a time when Nash was not willing to be kicked by the Pentagon. He made Nash feel valued and met Bole. From then on, he could go straight. This VIP-style treatment undoubtedly excites him and allows his vanity to be unprecedentedly satisfied, although this can also be attributed to the failure of his relationship. So whether he was in school or taking medicine, what he was most afraid of was his wise eyes ""blindness"". This taste is like interrupting the legs of a sportsman. The basics.<br/><br/>When you are alive, walking on the road, you are an ordinary person, not an academic elite, not a genius. You live a life as ordinary as others, and you must learn to respect life.<br/><br/>The true enemy of genius is genius, the opponent of idiot is idiot, and the person you never want to defeat is actually yourself.

If you look at it as a biopic, then ""A Beautiful Mind"" would not be the greatest of Hollywood movies. But, if you disregard the fact that this is indeed a retelling if John Nash's life (which, unfortunately, it is), then this is not only one of the most powerful movies of 2001, but of the 21st century. This would be a touching story about facing your demons and an important telling of the struggle of mental illness.

","John Nash's story is without a doubt interesting and certainly not easy to translate into a movie format. But that cannot be an excuse. We get a movie that is a bit of a heartbreaking drama, a bit of a spy action flick and a bit of a biographical picture (with many fictionalized parts). But it does nothing really exceptionally well. What it does well is to dumb everything down for a broad audience and to make it as little offending as possible.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>First, it would have been nice to see what makes John Nash actually a genius. We see him being awkward and weird, highly intelligent and constantly scribbling math on some surfaces. To the average movie audience it's clear: This man must be some sort of genius! Come on, don't treat your audience like that, Ron Howard! If you really must dumb it down, include maybe at least a reference to why he actually won the Nobel price and why his work was important. Well, at least we got the scene with the women in the bar.<br/><br/>Secondly, many details of Nash's life are just wrong or fictionalized, which does not have to be a bad thing per se. For example, in ""Amadeus"" the writer's allowed themselves a lot of freedom with Mozart's life in order to tell a greater, romanticised story about art. But here a story that was not always very ""clean"" in reality is told in a fashion for maximum Oscars chances. It wants to be a story full of heart (and even sacrifices intelligence for that), but if you take a closer look, it is a calculated movie. Anything that could be offensive is left out. Just google Nash's real biography if you don't believe me.<br/><br/>And this sugarcoating includes the depiction of schizophrenia. I don't have much insight into this mental illness but I'm sure it doesn't work in the way the movie shows us. Nash sees the same three imaginary people over and over again until we as an audience learn they are not real. Or are they? Initially, this state of confusion gave the movie interesting touch of mystery, that I actually enjoyed. I had no idea if this movie would stick to the sort-of-biopic-format or turn into an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.<br/><br/>It's really hard to find anything else to compliment. The cinematography looks kind of flat? And I can't even say I'm a fan of Connelly's slightly expressionless acting. Ironically, she won an Oscar instead of Crowe, who actually was quite convincing."
"bogdanteodorescu-13157","10","0","0","4 March 2018"," A remarkable movie you won't forget
","""A Beautiful Mind"" is brilliant. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard did an amazing job once again, the movie deserving the 4 Oscars and 4 Golden Globes, no doubt about that. It was clearly the best movie of 2001, actually one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The movie tells the story of the well-known mathematician John Nash, picturing his life from the moment he arrived at Princeton, until the winning of the Nobel Prize in the late 90's (for his extraordinary work in game theory, his work being a true foundation of economics). ""A Beautiful Mind"" is pretty accurate with the historical truth, presenting most of the struggles in Nash's life, although not all of them. <br/><br/>The plot was amazing, in my opinion another thing that impressed the people at the Academy. The viewer is made to see almost all the film through the eyes of John Nash, ignoring all the subtle hints at the mental-illness he is suffering of, everything making a lot of sense at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Also, the acting was amazing, and it really mattered. Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash was just stunning, culminating with the moments picturing Nash old and with his amazing body-language, the kind of things that even the best actors struggle with. This performance was clearly 
Crowe's best. Of course, Jennifer Connelly's acting shouldn't be overlooked. She knew how to handle all the moments of the movie flawlessly. <br/><br/>In my opinion, despite everything else, the most important part of the film is John Nash's inner-fight with his problems. From the heights of academical glory and recognition, to the depths of his mental-illness, John Nash is experiencing everything. Above all, the film gets into the deepest of Nash's
mind of soul. The movie expresses so well Nash's genius that there are no words to explain. Truly beautiful and honest.<br/><br/>No more words to say, judging with a very critical view, the film would get a rating of 9/10, because of the few historical truths hidden. Although, in my point view, the omitted truths can be easily ignored so it is maybe the most honest 10/10 rating I ever gave. The film is more than a 2-hour video, it
is the story of a genius, a story of both love and bravery. <br/><br/>Bogdan Teodorescu, 4th of March 2018<br/><br/>R.I.P. John Forbes Nash and Alicia Nash, 2015, amazing people<br/><br/>PARENTAL ADVISORY! The movie is very explicit, showing schizofrenia at it's worst.

","I never watched 'A Beautiful Mind' at its time of release as I wasn't a massive fan of Russell Crowe and I didn't know what the film was about. For me, this was the ultimate example of never judging a book by its cover. I still proclaim that the cover of the DVD looks pretty dull and gives no real hint as to what the film was about. Yes, I knew that Crowe won an Oscar for his performance and that it was a story about a guy who did stuff, but nothing about (the little) I heard about it really grabbed me. However, now nearly twenty years later, I finally got round to seeing what all the fuss was about. And I'm actually quite glad I did.<br/><br/>I guess my overriding predictions of 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it was a love story and nothing else. However, the film is actually based on the real life story of John Nash (Crowe), an American code-breaker who helped the US Government decipher Russian messages during the Cold War, making the whole thing more akin to a spy thriller than a romantic drama. I'm not saying that just because it's about spies you're going to get a load of high-octane James Bond car chases and gadgets. What you have here is a far more realistic take on the profession. We see how Nash is 'recruited' by the Government and the way he uses his gifts with patterns and numbers in order to help them out. Of course there's always going to be a reasonable helping of romantic sub-plot and here it comes in the form of Jennifer Connolly who becomes his wife throughout the course of the story. But, in my opinion (now!), it's primarily a spy story.<br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail regarding the rest of the plot as there are most likely some things that you won't see coming. Or, at least from my perspective as someone who knew nothing about the film before watching, I certainly didn't predict what would happen. But, I do recommend watching it, even if you're not a fan of spy-stuff. If nothing else then Crowe's performance is definitely worth a look. You can see why he got his Oscar as he does put everything he has into the portrayal of a man who, by his own admission, isn't that likeable and yet you want to see what happens to him. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer should also get mentions as they both provide integral parts of the story. I know Jennifer Connolly was good too, but I felt she had little to do other than be Nash's long-suffering partner throughout the story. It is a kind of long film and I think perhaps around fifteen to twenty minutes of the final act could probably have been trimmed to make it a tighter film. It may take me another twenty years to watch 'A Beautiful Mind' again, but I'm pretty sure one day I will.<br/><br/>"

He marries his beautiful and caring wife and starts secretly working for a mysterious person in an attempt to break a powerful encryption. All seems to go flawlessly but suddenly, a highly unexpected disease is discovered in his body, one that seems to have affected almost everything he has ever done. From there on, a very painful struggle begins, one on which his entire life depends on.<br/><br/>It's a very sad movie which seems to tell in its beginning the story of an extraordinary man but suddenly decides to present a very unexpected turn which leaves you completely dazzled. As much as it is mind blowing, as much it increases the drama of the entire movie, keeping you eager to find out the finale of this brilliant plot. The actors do a very good job reenacting their characters, managing to create a highly dramatic atmosphere which transmits emotion with every single scene it describes. I cannot explain how much this movie marked me with its incredible story and characters which ultimately ends with great style. It truly is a masterpiece, making it a must see for every single movie lover."

For me the love part is when he falls in love with his wife. It is amazing to me that love is so strong that she never gives up on him and although he never stops seeing his visions, she was always there by his side. Proof that behind every wise man is a powerful woman. My hats off to Alicia Nash for the strength. <br/><br/>It does break my heart that the whole time these were visions and it makes it hard to believe until they break it down for you and show you the evidence."

","As others have pointed out, Nash did not have any visual hallucinations; so the entire business with the imaginary people he kept ""seeing"" was made up by screenwriters. I've known a lot of schizophrenics in my years as a physician, and none of them had visual hallucinations- such visions are very rare. Almost all of them had paranoid delusions of conspiracies against them, and almost all heard voices, which is what Nash experienced. Usually the voices are condemnatory and frightening. It's hard to show that visually, so the screenwriters make up completely bogus ""symptoms"" that are a false depiction of what schizophrenics actually suffer. No sense arguing back and forth about whether the movie's depiction of Nash's ordeal is believable. It isn't what actually happened to him."

","You'll recall the scene in the movie when John Nash (Russell Crowe) is given an initial tour of Wheeler Labs, and he questions the presence of Big Brother watching from an elevated catwalk above the main floor. A hint to the viewer that what Nash is experiencing occurs later in the picture when William Parcher (Ed Harris) meets Nash for the first time, and refers to himself as 'Big Brother'. If in fact Parcher was a real person, it's doubtful that anyone at Wheeler would have revealed Nash's observation to him. That's what struck me the first time I saw this film and then again when I watched it once more this morning.<br/><br/>Well, like a lot of movies based on a true story that I initially find compelling and worthy of the highest rating here on IMDb, I'm left frustratingly disappointed that the screenplay distorts the facts in order to give the most appealing impression possible to the viewer. The main one here was Nash's relationship with wife Alicia, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly. Their first marriage only survived for three years before his schizophrenia drove them apart, resentful over the fact that she had him involuntarily committed. Their romantic relationship then rekindled after he won the Nobel Prize, and well after his mental illness had subsided.<br/><br/>What I liked about Crowe's portrayal of Nash was the way he came to grips with his delusions and later treated them with a dose of good humor - ""There's no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun"" is what he stated to his friend Sol (Adam Goldberg) when he came to visit. Later on, reinstated as a teaching professor at Princeton, he self assuredly asked a student to verify the presence of a 'new person' he hadn't seen before. Those subtle instances helped reestablish Nash as someone who recognized that he was mentally ill, and that he needed to control his health with the proper medication.<br/><br/>For anyone dealing with mental illness within their own family, I think this film can be an eye opener about the fear and hopelessness that the sick person experiences. I state that from a personal perspective having observed now adult children going through the pain and embarrassment of delusional fantasies that at times became downright scary. In that regard, the movie presents a reasonable perspective that illnesses like schizophrenia can be treated with the proper attention, a dedicated medical provider, and the correctly prescribed medication. I've seen it happen more than once."

","A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, and is about the life and career of John Nash, a mathematician who is studying at Princeton. Despite being a somewhat arrogant man, he maintains respect from fellow students and even attracts a women into his life.<br/><br/>However his world comes to a crashing halt when the life he thought he was in no longer exists...<br/><br/>The film is predominantly focused around the subject of mental illness. A topic alien for some, for others it makes the film really hit home. The film does a great job of explaining the basics while leaving out all of the difficult jargon and technical terms. It makes it become a learning experience for viewers.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Russell and Jenifer is outstanding here. They play off each other so well, making a close bond between them develop very quickly and with so much richness. A highlight of this for me is the first date they go on together. Its a beautiful collection of small scenes and for me could of been a vignette standing on its own.<br/><br/>A valuable message is made here. People with mental illness just want to be understood; to not be judged for the things out of their control. It is not their fault, and Alicia could see that in John. I suppose that this can be relatable for everyone and not just mental health sufferers. Accept people's quirks and only see the good in someone.<br/><br/>I do have only a few slight reservations with this film. It isn't a true depiction of who John Nash was a person (Russells character being greatly romanticised), and the time line of events is incorrect at the end. <br/><br/>However these are a few minor nit picks to what was an incredibly heart felt film, that wanted to spread whatever education and awareness it could around a subject people generally find uncomfortable talking about, but in this current time is gaining more a more momentum.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very powerful film and deserved all of the acclaim and awards it received. I urge anyone who is unsure or who hasn't experienced mental illness in some form, to watch it. You may learn something new."

","This film was something I legitimately tried to like. Really. Going into it, I had average expectations, hearing the hyper over it over the years, and I've always had a tangible interest in conditions such as schizophrenia. Though the movie does do some things that I like, the things that I find wrong are all the more troubling, to the point where I never want to watch it ever again.<br/><br/>So, here are the things I liked, at least at first:<br/><br/><ul><li>Russel Crowe's performance: believable. He did his job and did it well. I also enjoyed Ed Harris and Paul Bettany's performances.</li></ul><br/><br/>(SPOILER) - Subtlety. At least, when it comes to the schizophrenia aspect... in the middle of the movie. I think the subject was handled okay, up until the end when it began to feel a little forced (although I would honestly need to comb through that again, of which I am not interested in doing). There's one part in which a desk ends up being thrown out the window. In the next shot(s), something happens in the background that hints to the instability of the protagonist's perspective, that you later understand as the viewer.<br/><br/>These are the things that bugged the hell out of me:<br/><br/><ul><li>This is a sappy and contrived Hollywood picture, that instead of bringing issues that catalyzes honesty emotion, the events set in motion feel false, redundant, and overdramatic. I perfectly understand the weight of some of the situations (or the plot as a whole), but at the same time it felt like the movie didn't take the subject itself seriously and was following a paradigm to try and be ""one of those good movies.""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The mother effing romance. It was the most lackluster, flaky, force-fed, quickie-style romance I've seen in a movie this hyped. It felt artificial, it had no foundation or groundedness to it, nor chemistry, and worst of all, it was based on a real relationship that turned out much differently than what was shown in the film, and I feel is incredibly misleading and even PROPAGANDIC towards the whole relationship, which I feel is a disservice to the audience. It probably pisses me off more than most, but the romance in the film is so annoyingly recycled from every single film made in Hollywood. It was eye-rolling, and I simply can't stand it. In actuality, John Nash had an illegitimate son and had actually divorced from his wife and got back with her many years later. Why not include that? It simply didn't feel like it came from nonfiction source material. It felt like the oily, perverted hands of Hollywood.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The material it was based on. This felt like fiction - ""based on true events"" is correct, but I feel like these aren't real people, life doesn't go exactly this way. This is based on a certain reality - not the reality in which it's ADMITTEDLY AND PURPOSEFULLY based upon, which makes it worse when a film like this turns out to be so run of the mill. If the tone and details are going to be changed, why not make it a completely DIFFERENT story altogether? What if this film wasn't based on a REAL MAN and his LIFE? The sins of this film would be much more forgivable, I think. But it's not. It's about ""John Nash"" and his ""life.""</li></ul><br/><br/>Ultamitely, I would advise not to take the events of the film incredibly seriously, and judge by your own discretion if you have any interest in it."

","As Saturday night propositions go, the pitch for ""A Beautiful Mind"" is about as enticing as playing Happy Families with Fred West.<br/><br/>But put Russell Crowe in the cinematic equation and Ron Howard's latest portion of Academy-friendly fare becomes a good deal more appetising. Just as the brusque Antipodean's intensity and screen charisma blinded audiences to the flaws in ""Gladiator"", so he delivers another astonishing performance that more than compensates for this film's weaker facets.<br/><br/>A (highly) fictionalised biopic of real-life maths whizz John Forbes Nash Jr, it follows the socially stunted prodigy from his professional beginnings as a nervous freshman at Princeton, through Cold War spy machinations, and his struggle to hold together his marriage to fellow mathematician Alicia (Connelly).<br/><br/>Crowe is totally convincing - from 19-year-old student to OAP - giving a truth to Akiva Goldsman's occasionally twee dialogue and bringing fear and excitement to the most off-putting of subjects. Facing off with such a formidable, scene-stealing star would terrify a lesser actor than Jennifer Connelly, but she matches Crowe scene for scene. With a glamour and grace reminiscent of a 40s film star, and unafraid to suffer some unflattering close-ups of her angst- contorted face, the Golden Globe-winner delivers a performance that should see her secure a place on the A-list.<br/><br/>Another supporting player who signals his Hollywood arrival is Brit Paul Bettany, as Nash's enigmatic best friend - fulfilling the promise he showed in both ""Gangster No.1"" and ""A Knight's Tale"".<br/><br/>In truth it's the acting that makes the movie, for while Howard does a good job of actually making sums exciting - and pulls off a masterful narrative shift halfway through - he can't sidestep the pacing problems of biopics that try to cram in their subjects' entire life - perfunctorily whizzing through decades in the final half hour.<br/><br/>Still, such problems are forgivable as the tear-stained finale crowns a moving love story.<br/><br/>Who'd have thought algebra could be so exciting?"

","'A Beautiful Mind' had a lot going for it. An intriguing story based on an interesting man, a great cast full of talented actors, the involvement of James Horner and Roger Deakins (perhaps one of the best modern cinematographers in the business) and Ron Howard as director (a very competent director with some great films under his belt, directing always with a lot of quality and polish if not always distinction).<br/><br/>Finally seeing it, always wanting to but never quite having the time, 'A Beautiful Mind' was to me a good, often very good, film, if not quite great. Of its four Oscar wins, Connelly and adapted screenplay (on the most part) were worthy wins, though there were better contenders in the Best Picture and Director categories, 'Fellowship of the Ring' for Best Picture and David Lynch for 'Mulholland Drive' for director. Again, from personal opinion, 'A Beautiful Mind's' Oscar nominations were worthier of wins generally, especially Russell Crowe for Best Picture, make-up and the film editing, cinematography also should have been under serious consideration.<br/><br/>There are a few things that stop 'A Beautiful Mind' from being great. Pacing can be messy, feeling rushed in some spots and then dragging in others. Admittedly though there were other places where it was perfect.<br/><br/>Do agree with the portrayal of schizophrenia being problematic, it is a sensitive and courageous subject to address but those with schizophrenia and mental illness in general will find problems with how it's portrayed. It is a complex and often frightening illness, that the film tries to take seriously and sensitively, but it just felt too clean and like it was being careful not to offend but ended up being too careful. Other aspects are heavy-handed.<br/><br/>The espionage subplot was intriguing mostly and gave some powerful conflict, at the same time parts not quite gelling with the rest of the film and feeling a little confused.<br/><br/>However, 'A Beautiful Mind' for want of a better word looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography with the vibrant colours and seamless fluidity was one of the best of its year, and the period detail remarkably evocative and a joy to look at. James Horner's score has garnered mixed views, mostly leaning on the positive, personally though it added a lot to the emotional power of the film, swelled thrillingly and was beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, didn't think it was melodramatic at all.<br/><br/>'A Beautiful Mind's' adapted screenplay really makes one think while also capturing a wide range of emotions, more than making up for the lack of accuracy. The story is compelling on the most part with a spot on portrayal of mathematics, something that was praised by the maths community at the time including John Nash. It is very moving and uplifting, many scenes dealt with powerfully.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's direction is some of the best he's done. As ever from him it is rich in quality and polish but it also is some of his most distinguished and shows that he can direct with distinction (even if he doesn't always elsewhere.<br/><br/>Can't praise the cast enough, along with the visuals it is the best aspect of the film. It is impossible to find fault with the powerhouse and perhaps career best performance of Russell Crowe, while Jennifer Connelly is touching in a loyal and sympathetically written role (even if not as challenging as a few of her other roles such as in 'Requiem for a Dream'.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is chillingly malevolent, while the rarely less than game Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg charm and Judd Hirsch and Christopher Plummer also not putting a foot wrong.<br/><br/>In conclusion, admirable and extremely well made, directed and acted with a sizeable range of emotions, if missing the mark of being a ""great"" film instead of a good and often very good film and not doing enough justice to a great man and his life. The divisiveness is understandable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Which fortunately turned this to an even more intriguing for me. Maybe that is why my first recommendation would be do not research anything beforehand in order to avoid despoiling the surprises of this movie. These types of movies expect nil information about the plot on the viewers part. That is how they will successfully bind you.<br/><br/>A beautiful mind is an American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. In this movie, John Nash was suffering from a disease schizophrenia. Now the question arrives, What the hell is Schizophrenia? Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people, the places, the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been. What kind of hell would that be? This movie is the answer. It shows, How John Nash proves that psychiatrists were wrong about schizophrenia being a brain disease like Alzheimers and Parkinson's. How he refuses to hospitalize himself and courageously decides to tackle with the imaginary people inside his mind. This is the plot on which this movie is based.<br/><br/>According to me, what makes this movie different from others is it's extraordinary attention to the details. There is nothing mentioned in the movie which could come in conflict with your common reasoning. There are no violation of nature's law, no preternatural intelligence, no ostentatious scenes which could be refuted by my reasoning skills. For example, When Parcher implanted IC inside Nash's hand which he used while unlocking the doors (by scanning his hand on the scanner). In the next scenes where movie reveals Parcher was a fictional character because of Nash's disease. I was in between devils and the deep as my mind was continuously asking why the hell he was not checking his hand for the IC? That would be the biggest proof whether the characters are imaginary or real. Guess what? Within few moments I see Nash scratching his hand for the IC. which made both of us believe that he was suffering from the disease. Again, when Parcher meets Nash and tries to maintain his credibility of his real existence. He said the IC which was implanted vanished because it was made of Radium which decayed completely. I was enthralled by this scene and for the second time along with Nash, I believed Parcher is no more a fictional character.<br/><br/>I think, the rationality of this movie is what makes it so great. While watching this movie, I placed myself at Nash's situation, and was trying to figure out how I would deal. Believe me, the things which I thought I would do to solve these conflict, the same solutions Nash used in the movie. The only thing which I think only Nash could do was the finesse with which he dealt with such characters.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the way this movie tries to explain things with rationality which themselves are irrational is simply beyond one's approach. Quoting one scene from the movie.<br/><br/>When John Nash Proposes Alicia.<br/><br/>Nash: Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.<br/><br/>Alicia: I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance.<br/><br/>Alicia: How big is the universe?<br/><br/>Nash: Infinite.<br/><br/>Alicia: How do you know?<br/><br/>Nash: I know because all the data indicates it's infinite.<br/><br/>Alicia: But it hasn't been proved yet.<br/><br/>Nash: No.<br/><br/>Alicia: You haven't seen it.<br/><br/>Nash: No.<br/><br/>Alicia: How do you know for sure?<br/><br/>Nash: I don't, I just believe it.<br/><br/>Alicia: It's the same with love I guess.<br/><br/>There are still a lot more to say about this movie which I found highly admirable. Things which can only be observed and that's why you should watch this movie."
"ElMaruecan82","6","0","0","5 June 2017"," Nash Disequilibrium...
","""A Beautiful Mind"" presents all the characteristics of a great film but since it deals with schizophrenia and visual and aural elements that aren't what they seem to be, I wondered sometimes if what I was seeing wasn't just elements of episodic greatness wrapped up in a story that actually had less substantial things to say than what the raving critics pretend it said. Ron Howard used to make movies that worked both on and beneath the surface, but this is a case where many elements of one man's life overlap and generate more confusion than fascination. That it won the Oscar for Best Picture has the same puzzling effect than of a math riddle.<br/><br/>The film is a legitimate biopic about one of the most interesting minds of the twentieth century. I'm not sure I would call it 'beautiful', even Einstein didn't get that title, but 'fascinating', it sure was. It belongs to John Forbes Nash, the mathematician and economist who paved the way for a new conception of governing dynamics and competition, less through the theory of games than the notion of equilibrium, the fact that the lesser of two evils is a wiser option than 'everyone for himself'. I'm not being persnickety but I wish the film dedicated more time to his revolutionary work, I studied economics and the 'Nash equilibrium' was one of these lessons that instantly inspired me and I could see countless situations where the genius of Nash was applied.<br/><br/>Maybe being a math buff influenced my expectations and I'm perfectly aware that this is only a cinematic adaptation, that Ron Howard or Akiva Goldman (the writer) are entitled to their narrative choices, but I was disappointed to see the 'sick' side of Nash' personality being shamelessly unleashed especially after the superficial treatment his game theory got, though I loved its application on the way to approach women. The second act of the film primarily deals with the diseases that struck that 'beautiful' mind but could have been a more subtle treatment of his mental condition, not just a translation into archetypal cinematic language but something in par with the subtle and realistic way Nash was played in the first act as a graduate student from Princeton whose sociability isn't exactly his strongest suit and his interactions with his co-workers or with women work as efficient comical moments.<br/><br/>Indeed, to a fellow recipient of a prestigious Mathematics scholarship (Josh Lucas), Nash slyly declares that he found nothing seminal in any of the articles he wrote, and to a woman, well, let's just that a reference to sexual fluids earned him a nice slap in the face. Russell Crowe is quite convincing as Nash, a guy never looking his straight in the eyes, often down, looking for patterns in everything, and looking forward to having his scientific epiphany. There's a moment where he just lost a Go game and is puzzled because he played the part perfectly, this display of bad loser's spirit would have been more efficient had it not been immediately followed by another one where he throws his office desk from the window, encouraged by his roommate, an imaginary 'literature' student played by Paul Bettany and it seems like the writer was already preparing us for weirdness. This is a film that would have benefited from less spectacular stunts, no matter how supposedly true to Nash' life they were.<br/><br/>So, once the article about governing dynamics is published and made a name out of Nash, the film makes a chronological leap where we find him as an MIT teacher. He there meets Alicia, a beautiful student, played by Jennifer Connelly, and if not original, the chemistry is believable. This is where something derails the narrative again, once you get the point that mathematics won't play a part to the story, you accept to get to the intimate life, but then for some reason, the writer decides it's time for us to get to the piece of resistance. Then the film focuses on subplots involving a mysterious agent from Ministry of Defense (Ed Harris) assigning Nash to thwart a Russian plot by finding patterns in newspapers. Then the film turns into some sort of copycat-political thriller with chase sequences and shootouts, that aren't even supposed to be real.<br/><br/>The treatment of schizophrenia is so visible, logic and structured that the whole thing loses its credibility, it's on the same level as 'Inception' or the Matrix while I wish it was a bit more like 'Pi', or something that could really be perceived as mental internal, it is a biopic after all. Not that the film is always about Nash's hallucinations but even the rest is an uneven experience, it starts with elements of abstraction that makes you penetrate in the world of Nash, his fascination for patterns, in the sky, but then we're plunged in a succession of archetypal situations that occupy so much of the story every other character becomes just an observer of Nash' deterioration, even Alicia becomes the obligatory long suffering wife without any subtlety. How about having the insight of the one sane person who was the closest to Nash, his wife? <br/><br/>Her performance was good enough to earn her an Oscar but it's not the same complexity as in her ""Requiem for a Dream"". As for Nash, we don't see the math genius but the victim of a severe mental condition, but it's handled in such a way it's difficult to care about it. The film is well acted, well directed, but I'm not sure it does justice to the legacy of a man reduced for almost half the film to things that didn't even happen. As spectacular as they were, I don't think they belonged to the film, and maybe, quoting Nash who commented on a bad tie, and after having 'enjoyed' other Goldman's screenplays, there might be a pattern explaining how bad his narrative choices are."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","17 May 2017"," A unique film and one of Ron Howard's best
","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-nominated biography of American mathematician John Nash. Beginning at Princeton University in the late 1940's, the movie focuses on his early contributions to economic theory and his subsequent, prolonged struggle with mental illness.<br/><br/>As is often the case with biographical films, the script is fairly loosely based on the actual events. Some may take exception to this but I feel that the changes serve a valid dramatic purpose. Additionally, the means of portraying Nash's mental state required some artistic license. Again, I feel that this is handled effectively, though who really knows if it's particularly reflective of Nash's actual experiences?<br/><br/>In any case, the story is an involving one that spans many years. The factual basis provided an intriguing foundation for screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to construct a script that puts the viewers in Nash's shoes. The paranoid atmosphere of 1950's America supplies an ideal backdrop for Nash's unravelling sanity while the aftermath is just as interesting. It should be noted that Goldsman was rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts.<br/><br/>Of course, much of the credit for bringing Nash to life must go to Russell Crowe. Fresh off his Oscar win for ""Gladiator"", Crowe found himself nominated for an Oscar for the third year in a row, this time for perhaps the best performance of his career. He wasn't on his own, though. The lovely & talented Jennifer Connelly took home an Oscar for her portrayal of Nash's devoted wife. The supporting cast wasn't bad either, featuring Ed Harris & Paul Bettany in memorable roles along with the likes of Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer & Adam Goldberg.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's direction is solid, as usual, though I'm not convinced that he deserved to win the Oscar that year over some very tough competition. Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a well directed film, both visually and performance-wise. The Oscar-nominated score by James Horner is also notable, as is the Oscar-nominated makeup that convincingly aged Crowe & others over the course of decades.<br/><br/>All in all, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an effective film that ranks as one of Ron Howard's best in a career studded with several crowd-pleasers. Arguments could certainly be made for other films as being more deserving of 2001's Best Picture Oscar but the movie was by no means undeserving. Just don't go into it expecting stringent adherence to the facts."

","This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John won Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory-- has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.<br/><br/>This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, the American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come."

","Ron Howard is always great at adapting true stories into well- structured biopics. Whether it be Rush, Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, or A Beautiful Mind, he has a knack for representing real people well while also adding some movie magic in there as well.<br/><br/>The first time I watched A Beautiful Mind I was blown away by it. Not only did I think all of the actors did a tremendous job sinking their teeth into each role, but I couldn't believe how fascinating John Nash's life was. This is a man was a student at Princeton and made significant contributions to the world of mathematics and economics (including proposing several theories and equations), all while being diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as John Nash, in what also may be his most challenging. Crowe has to make it believable that he's both one of the brightest minds in the world but also someone who is seriously struggling with mental illness. He has great chemistry with his love interest, Alicia Nash, played by Jennifer Connelly. In fact, I think this film is a better romance than it is a biopic. Connelly, who won an Oscar for playing Alicia, is a revelation here. She had impressed in previous films, but there's something about her balancing the sweetness of Alicia's personality with her turmoil filled personal life.<br/><br/>I think the main issue with A Beautiful Mind is its pace. At 138 minutes, it's right about at the length of your usual bio-drama, but it doesn't feel like it. The film moves at a really slow pace, especially before we realize what Nash is going through mentally. Part of the reason for this is that I found it hard to approach the complexities of his work. The story is interesting, but I can't say I knew exactly what was going on half the time. If the film would have found a way to make all the equations and theories dumbed down for the general audience, the film would have felt much smoother.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is well done. I love James Horner's score, Roger Deakin's cinematography is beautiful, as is the romance between Connelly and Crowe, but I think it lacks in re-watchability and pacing.<br/><br/>+Romance<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Strong performances<br/><br/>+Extraordinary story<br/><br/>-But difficult to follow at times<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","This film chronicles the life of American mathematician John Nash, a genius considered one of the most remarkable mathematicians of the twentieth century. I confess I did not know him until I saw the film, but I found it interesting how he tells his life, using his life's adventures to make the story more appealing to the public. Not everything the film shows is exactly true but if we except the writer's creative and narrative freedoms, the film is close enough to reality for a biopic. Russel Crowe plays the protagonist, and he does it in a generally good way.

It has cost me my job, home, wife, friends, etc. Little did I know 90% of marriages end in divorce with one partner that is bipolar. I'd wake up every morning with terrible stomach problems not even realizing it was anxiety. I guess as a man you just suck it up, but it caught up with me as work became more demanding. Thankfully with the help of medication it is managed somewhat although it makes me lethargic, tired, have memory/concentration issues, and not be as coordinated.<br/><br/>Thing is, it is also a gift.

"sherineyousery","7","0","0","25 March 2014"," Very confusing movie ..
","Confused between having to give it a very low rating or a very high one and with hundreds of reviews written before mine, I still want to make a few points. Maybe it would help out someone:<br/><br/>1- Biographically: I've read that the real John Nash had an entirely different story. Please tell me would you take the history and life of a man and change it entirely, deceiving a lot of people and mutilating history to make a movie ?! Couldn't you change the names and say that it was ""inspired"" bu a true story ?! Was it that hard or was it not at appealing and interesting ?! So I agree with everyone out here bashing out this movie for being that inaccurate and deceiving.<br/><br/>2- Regarding the fictional love story: it was a little real. When you love someone with all your heart and senses, Hollywood -in a lot of other movies- would be selling you lies. The reality is that even the most romantic couples with the most beautiful love stories ever suffer a lot, fight but stick around. So, it was to some degree realistic. <br/><br/>3- Regarding the mental illness:<br/><br/>Some people here say it was very unrealistic and a fairy tale. Those people didn't pay enough attention to a lot of details in the movie like the baby who would drown or the people making fun of the professor. So I disagree, it showed much truth, although not in every aspect. <br/><br/>There's a very important aspect that was very disrespected in the movie: the Psychiatrist's image and the medications, which I overlooked because that might be the case with some of the patients who weren't taught how medications would help or have had experiences with bad psychiatrists.<br/><br/>A point I found ridiculous and offensive to a great extent, however, was how mental illnesses were portrayed as if a patient with some strong will would overcome them without hospitalization, psychiatric help or medication, just his ""heart"" as pointed by the wife in the movie. This was utterly stupid, this is a disease who sick people should be taught how to cope with, or in other words, a state of mind that you have to learn to live with. <br/><br/>However, there's a very important aspect clarified here: disorders are not things you have to get rid of or cure, rather than states of mind or in other words, chronic cases, medication should help in some cases, therapy would help greatly too in a lot of cases, and you have to cope with it. Pain makes the most beautiful and the wisest people as I have seen in my life, especially mental and psychological pain, and if the patient/individual knew how to learn from it. <br/><br/>4- Technical Details: The acting was marvelous and the soundtrack stood out. The direction overall could have been a little better and of course, the writing is really criticized for all the deception.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie recommended and shows a lot of reality for some people, but is a sorrow to see it transform true people's stories into fabrications."

","One of the best ways to describe this movie is that it is so realistic, which is also the very reason for my liking. In each phase of the movie, the Russell's character depicts the realistic nature of a human being, which indeed is reinforced by his artistic and more naturalistic way of acting only to make it more realistic and which makes you like it. Connelly is my favorite actress, however I am not biasing when I say, that she has performed her role so beautifully. I just started loving her after I watched this movie. So, basically, the movie is about a maths professor who is so lively and exuberant about his works and always tries to prove something. Is he really working as he thinks he is or is he just fooling himself?? Ron moved the movie so meticulously that the watcher doesn't get deviated or at least doesn't want to.

","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind,"" contains a visual treat that I won't soon forget. I'm talking about a scene a little over halfway into the film, where our protagonist John–played by Russell Crowe (of ""Gladiator"" fame)–sits in the kitchen with his wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly (""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Blood Diamond""). He's beginning to fall back into his disorder, and sits at a table, playing with a strange suction cup unicorn toy. Alicia is starting to grow increasingly more frustrated with John, and steps over to the refrigerator.<br/><br/>There is a clear divide in their marriage, and even though it is portrayed so clearly on-screen, we are provided with a powerful, yet subtle reminder here. A wall literally separates the two of them, their backs are turned to one another, and although they are having a conversation, they are both concentrating on different things.<br/><br/>This is the kind of provoking imagery that Ron Howard has put together for his audience, along with ASC Roger Deakins (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Skyfall"", ""Shawshank Redemption"").<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" follows the true, yet flawed, story of a brilliant mathematician, named John Nash, who struggles to live with schizophrenia. We begin our excavation into his life starting first at his entry into Princeton, and our journey ends with Nash in old age. As grumpy and–for the most part, socially inept–an old fart as he was in his younger years. Regardless of his laughable social ability, he makes lifelong friends (and gets hitched) despite his strange behavior; even though he's kind of a jerk. He is quite lovable. Whether this is the beauty of Crowe's fantastic work as an actor, or the tediousness of a well-designed script, I will leave that decision up to you.<br/><br/>Even though we focus mostly on Nash, we do spend a good portion of time with Alicia. I must say that I truly appreciated her character's devotion to John. Unfortunately, many times in film, a love interest is thrown in as an afterthought to spice up the sex appeal, but here is not the case (although, Connelly looks somewhat stunning as an older woman). What I admired most about her screen time is her unrelenting sense of hope. Granted, she does grab their child and begins driving away at one point (but you would too if your husband nearly drowned the little tot.) Alicia inspires a true feeling of redemption for Nash's character, and she sees it through until the end. A marvelous picture of the difficulties of marriage and endless perseverance through it, I assure you.<br/><br/>Of course, Howard would never let his audience go without extra fun, and this comes in the form of actors: Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, and Ed Harris, who play respectively: Nash's psychiatrist, Charles (one of Nash's friendly hallucinations), and Parcher (a government agent hallucination, hell-bent on pushing Nash to decipher non-existent Russian codes from various publications and magazines.)<br/><br/>Something that Howard does excruciatingly well here is not spoon-feeding the story to his audience. The plot isn't simple, even though the ""Fight Club-esque"" reveal of ""multiple personalities"" is somewhat predictable; if you know much about the film. It definitely isn't a tidy film presented in a gift-wrapped box. There are a few short scenes that make you just a bit queasy to help you understand more fully just how emotionally and physiologically painful Nash's condition was on himself and those around him. It is necessary in my opinion.<br/><br/>There is a bit of cheese, in the form of a special pen gifting scene directed towards Nash, representing the level of respect that he had gained over the years, again, despite his medical condition. To explain the symbolism of these ""pens,"" one should simply watch the film to understand. Very shortly afterwards, Nash gives his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. As he gazes out into the audience, he says, ""I have made the most important discovery of my career – the most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found. I am only here tonight because of you"" His eyes fixate on Alicia, as he toys with a pocket square in his coat; a nod to an earlier moment in the film.<br/><br/>These moments are excusably cheesy, and serve to fully send home the idea that if it was not for the persistence of Nash to push through his disease in his fashion, and if it was not for Alicia's complete devotion to him as a wife, he likely would have driven himself mad and lived in an asylum for the remainder of his life. Fortunately, this is not the case, and in light of his random outbursts at home and on-campus at Princeton, he is able to live out a strange, yet somewhat regular life.<br/><br/>We feel only the utmost sympathy for John and Alicia, and by pushing against all odds, they find victory. We love these stories, don't we? The academy loved it enough to present it with four Oscars, including Best Picture. Isn't that nifty?<br/><br/>The only blotch I found on this wonderful tale is the true story of John Nash. In real life, he didn't actually begin experiencing hallucinations until after his marriage with Alicia. He also had a child with a previous girlfriend, and Alicia eventually divorced him and married someone else. They remained very close friends however, and she provided him a place to stay, and helped him through his disorder. A few Hollywood modifications, to be sure, but its always a little sad when the movies are prettier than real life, isn't it?<br/><br/>A humbling response is knowing that Nash was, and still is an astonishingly brilliant man. He still keeps office hours at Princeton, and he still walks to school everyday. An impossibly smart and beautiful mind."

But somehow, Crowe makes us connect with him through his amazing acting, and actually puts us in his shoes. By the time the movie ends, you will most likely be looking up John Nash's true story just because you connect with him in the movie (I would not recommend looking up the true story until after watching the movie, because it will spoil a twist in the movie). The acting is better than almost anything I have ever seen. Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance (as always), and you'd almost expect it to say ""Actual Footage"" at the bottom of the screen.

","Sylvia Nasar does a superb job of informing readers about John Nash's struggles with schizophrenia in the biography A Beautiful Mind. Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, is an eminent mathematician with (in the words of a colleague) ""a beautiful mind."" Unfortunately, it's also a sick mind. Although he manages to function ""normally"" these days, without the aid of medication, Nash is still a schizophrenic (who has an adult son who suffers from the same disease).As moviegoers know, Ron Howard directed the movie version of the book, starring Russell Crowe. While the film does a fine job of introducing audiences to the ins and outs of schizophrenia and the difficulties that caregivers experience while trying to assist someone afflicted with the disease, it shows only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone wanting to know more about what schizophrenia entails should read Nasar's book. It is gripping and reveals the agonies of a schizophrenic life. Thoroughly researched and effectively presented in a cohesive narrative which fully engages the attention of readers, this biography shows how Nash fell prey to the disease and how his family-first his mother and sister, and later his wife-sought to have him treated and provided with the best medical care then available. At one point that treatment called for electric shock treatment (as vividly dramatized in the movie).Nash's colleagues, many of whom had relatives who were schizophrenics or who were schizophrenics themselves, helped him time and time again, when he was at risk of becoming unemployed and/or destitute. Through sheer force of will, Nash managed to pull himself back from the brink and to pursue a life of domestic contentment and professional achievement. His is definitely a story worth knowing. And Nasar relates it in detail and comprehensively, helping readers to appreciate the horror of possibly losing such a beautiful mind."
"ambernixon-435-830643","6","0","0","29 July 2012"," A Beautiful Mind is a story about a man coming to grips with the limitations of his mind.
","Russell Crowe, playing John Nash, makes the focus of the later part of his life trying to come up with a ""truly original idea"". As he attempts to achieve this process, we watch as he struggles with relationships and interactions with other people. Having limited social grace, in a notably prestigious school such as Princeton, serves to prove as almost rewarding considering his luck at catching the attention of women. This is most especially true as he meets a beautiful girl named Alicia, Jennifer Connelly, who turns out to be his new love interest. When Nash inadvertently becomes acquainted with a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, the reality lines become blurred as Nash struggles to figure out whom and what is real, and what is not. In watching A Beautiful Mind, one can see the common theme is to battling our own realities. Nash makes it truly his entire focus on strengthening and using his mind for realistic and meaningful purposes. In his attempt to develop ""a truly original idea"", he becomes engulfed in his own reality and is unaware that in fact he is displaying schizophrenic tendencies. Others are engulfed in their own realities as it took many years later for anyone to recognize his need for psychiatric assistance. Associated with these episodes you can see another storyline incorporated as viewers become aware of other's reaction to what is socially acceptable of the time. Although criticism and backlash may be less harsh than our current societal tendencies, Nash suffers from stigmas throughout the rest of the film. Each character faces their own reality, and deviation from what is thought to actually exist, to what actually exists. This film similarly relates to the movie, Fight Club, where an imagination of a counterpart and friend, alter the realities of many other individuals. When Nash suddenly becomes introduced to a young student Alicia, his social limitations serve him well by giving him an endearing and mystifying quality. As the film progresses you are drawn into his secret purpose of decoding cryptography. One becomes excited at his possible discovery and chance of leaving even more social woes behind in his rise to hero status. Ironically his very worst stigma, social awkwardness, is what saves his relationships and his life, but in doing so Nash makes difficult decisions about his treatment. Finally getting close to Alicia and securing their love, allowed someone to finally focus and see an unhindered view into Nash's mind. Crowe and Connelly give suburb performances when considering the emotional state in which they must become a part of. Crowes interpretation on one's reality breaking and social awkwardness is displayed brilliantly through his jerky movements, disheveled appearance, almost vacant eyes, and sometimes mumbling dialogue. Connelly's performance of a wife trying dutifully to support her husband makes one want to break down right along beside her. When she gets angry, becomes concerned, feels lonely, the viewer feels her emotions. Her downcast eyes and her posture begin to sag with the weight of her emotions. We feel her pain and hope for her to be strong for Nash, but also hope for her happiness and freedom of safety. Two techniques I viewed at associated well with the theme were lighting and angle. Lighting was very subdued, echoing the recesses of his mind. Nash constantly focuses on the task, the goal, not the excitement of the journey and other surroundings. Various times when Nash was in Alicia's company, you can understand the change of lighting to a brighter shade as he was happier, not trapped within the limitations of his mind, enjoying the moment. Angle was also very important to the film, as many times you can see how the camera follows him and his unusual actions, or the angle cuts to how someone is socially judging his actions. In addition, many of his earlier public scenes with his schizophrenic counterparts were filmed without his other peer's taking notice, so not only they but the viewer wasn't able to immediately establish anything was wrong. Regardless of whether one believes in the process of medicine to overcome your own realities, one can safely say the definition of reality is very different for every person."

","I own the DVD of this movie and have watched it more than once. It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions. Intriguing in its own right, I'm glad I saw it."

","I guess my main problem with this movie is that it has tinkered to much with the real John Nash, his life, and illness. Probably if the movie had been a documentary it would have been to boring, but great liberties are taken around his personal life etc to cast doubts over its overall integrity.<br/><br/>That said, it is a movie that forces the viewer to engage, and even might demand that critical viewers reflect on their own mental issues. As a recovered (hopefully) alcoholic I never underestimate the power and nature of the deranged mind.<br/><br/>It was an interesting choice for Russell Crowe to play the part of Nash, and certainly the support crew is superb. Crowe does a good job but coming so close after Gladiator I do wonder if there might have been another choice.<br/><br/>At a personal level I find this challenging and while I watch it about once a year sometimes I need to turn it off. Not perfect, but challenging, and pleased to see it hanging in to the IMDb Top 250 list."

","This film touched me deeply, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" should not be ignored and should be viewed by those who feel out of place with themselves and try their hardest to show their potential..but never seem to be able to get it across to someone. As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparable to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstacle that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed."

","This Best Picture Oscar winner is based on the real life of Mathmatician John Nash who won a Nobel Prize for his work yet was constantly challenged by his mental illness of Schitzophrenia, we see Russell Crowe take the lead role and as usual he does not disappoint. In fact the acting in this movie is pretty much flawless and very well cast. Jennifer Connelly (winner of Best Supporting Actress Oscar) is fantastic as the loving yet somewhat emotionally drained wife.<br/><br/>This movie does take a fair while to really get going and for those of us who didn't get the highest mark in maths at school a lot of the jargon will go over our heads. But be patient by about the 40 min mark things start falling into place and the pace goes up a couple of gears with a few twist and turns along the way.<br/><br/>The Cinematography is beautiful thru out so I have no complaints there. In fact I don't have many complaints at all its pretty much a flawless movie thou for me it just misses out on the full 10 marks because as previously stated there's a lot of things that went over my head and it takes a while to gain a decent pace. I would def recommend it to fans of Biopics and Drama.<br/><br/>If You like movies such as 'The Aviator' 'Good Will Hunting' and the 'Bourne'series then you should enjoy this movie and vice versa if you enjoy the movie and after something similar those mentioned would be a good place to start.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading really hope you enjoy this movie."

","This movie is very loosely based on the life of one John Forbes Nash, Jr. There are definitely some additions to his life in this movie, but, from what I read about his life, there's still quite a bit from his real life in the movie, which is one of the reasons why I give this movie a perfect score.<br/><br/>First, let me tell you a little about Nash: He was a genius who worked in game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. However, his life was plagued by the unfortunate disease known as Schizophrenia. He spoke of characters, such as Charles Herman and William Parcher, characters who did not exist. His life became one nightmare after the other during this time, as these visions would threaten everything in his world, including that of his then-wife.<br/><br/>Ron Howard definitely deserved the best director award here, but if anything, it was the acting that got me hooked. Russell Crowe does a very good job as Nash, who, all his life, wanted to look for an idea. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia Nash, who starts off as a student of Nash's, and ends up becoming the wife who fears for Nash. Connelly definitely deserved her award for this; If any other work of hers parallels ""Blood Diamond,"" it is this one. Ed Harris, of course, is always great in every movie he's in, and this one is no different. He plays the Parcher delusion, who is an agent for the Department of Defence, and is trying to get Nash to help them fight the Soviets. Paul Bettany is great as the Charles Herman delusion, who becomes Nash's best friend throughout his university years. Josh Lucas is great, and those who remember watching ""The Sound of Music"" when they were younger will be delighted to see Christopher Plummer on the screen here.<br/><br/>All in all, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a well-acted movie that is both a touching love story and an educational look at any type of psychiatric disorder. 10/10 for me."

","I have seen A Beautiful Mind several times and I still love it just as much as the first time I viewed this film. Russell Crowe does a great job of playing the main character of John Nash. The title of this movie is very appropriate because the entire film is based on the way John Nash's mind works. You are led to think that the title is based on a man's mind and how truly brilliant he really is when it comes to being a mathematician. John Nash is on a quest to find a mathematical theorem which in itself is very interesting. In terms of the whole film, the title actually begins to take on a different meaning in the middle of the movie when the viewer discovers they have been witnessing a man that is ill. The reality that the viewer sees is actually the reality of a man with an illness. His wife in the film is Alicia Nash played by Jennifer Connelly who stands by her husband the entire movie. Parcher is one of John Nash's delusions and is played by Ed Harris. The theme of the film is more defined by the middle of the movie which showed that even though an illness was involved, John Nash still had a beautiful mind.<br/><br/>John Nash proves in the film that the opportunity to be successful can still exist even if someone has something holding them back such as a mental illness. He ends up being diagnosed with schizophrenia and that is where Parcher, one of his delusions, becomes part of his life. As John Nash struggles through treatment he also discovers the true meaning of love with the help of Alicia, his faithful wife. She is shown throughout the film doing everything in her power to help her husband battle his illness and helps him lead a normal life. One of my favorite scenes which validates the theme of the movie is when a member of the Nobel Committee is interviewing John Nash regarding the process of accepting a prize if it were awarded to him. The man interviewing John Nash is basically asking him if he was crazy or if he would do anything crazy on stage. His response was very simple and straight forward stating that yes, he was crazy and that even though the medication does help, it does not eliminate the fact that he still sees people that are not there. Nash said that he chooses not to discuss them with anyone anymore, which proves that he has learned to live with his illness and still live a successful life. At that very moment his Princeton colleagues begin stepping up towards his table where the interview was being conducted. One by one they reach out to his table and present their pens to John Nash stating that it was truly an honor to have Professor Nash there. This action in itself was a big statement that solidified the success that he has achieved.<br/><br/>The second part of the theme is in regards to Nash discovering the true meaning of love. This theme is validated during the Nobel Prize Ceremony in December of 1994 when the speech he gave was dedicated to Alicia. It was a very simple speech but powerful and important to his wife. The angle the camera uses in this shot at the Nobel Prize Ceremony included an appearance of John Nash towering above thousands of people giving a thunderous applause. The camera shot of the attentive audience during his speech showed their respect, and the standing ovation after his speech showed their approval. The colors used in this scene are warm including gold, yellow, and orange. The last look on Nash's face after his speech was priceless. He stood there in almost disbelief and looked directly at his wife who at this point was in tears. All of Nash's struggles throughout his life with his wife remaining by his side really gave the viewer a sense of satisfaction in the last scene. John Nash truly ended up being a successful man in more than one aspect of his life regardless of the illness he carried with him."

","A beautiful,insightful and very moving film which is a joy to watch. The script and direction are superb and the film zips along at a 'page-turning' rate which will continually have you asking 'what happens next' as it is a rolled up thriller, love story and biography in one. For me, it was also a revelation in terms of Russell Crowe as an actor. I had admired his playing in 'Gladiator' and thought he was good fun to watch in 'Master and Commander' (while, on the other hand, I had thought his 'Robein Hood' was a disaster and a waste of talent all round - not least for including the usually marvellous Cate Blanchett in its proceedings as well!) In this film, though, Crowe is a revelation and shows some of the best movie screen acting I have ever witnessed. His portrayal of the lead character is achingly beautiful, with many high points (culminating in his 'Nobel Acceptance Speech' which had me on the verge of tears!) A marvellous film all round!"

","Aside from Crowe's brilliant performance, I would like to share a few thoughts about the meaning of this movie.<br/><br/>Nash was an homosexual. After WWII he was, like other brilliant men such as Turing in the UK, persecuted for that. He also came up with a theory that would threaten the hegemony of the neoclassic school of thought.<br/><br/>For these two reasons I can't help but feeling anger rise when faced with history as this movie rewrites it.<br/><br/>Nash is depicted as an harmless scatterbrain, being given the prize once his ideas have become extinct, flooded in the triumph of the post-USSR world hegemony of the economy-driven powers.<br/><br/>What a reassuring thought to think, really: one who refuses to abide to the new world order must have gone seriously funny in the head for quite a long time.

","This film is really good. It seemed to start of a bit slow and some of the early scenes, involving Mr Nash at Princeton were a bit boring for me. There are a couple of good scenes at this stage however, such as when they visit a bar and Mr Nash deduces him and his comrades potential success rates with a group of young co-eds. <br/><br/>Moving on...the film really picks up pace by the time you hit the half way mark and there are some quite brilliant scenes involving Mr Nash, Mrs Nash and the schizophrenic illness that is a having a profound and wearing effect on them both. Mr Nash is in denial, whilst Mrs Nash is at her wits end. When Mr Nash does finally come to his senses it is the result of what is is quite a harrowing scene, and the revelation is filmed beautifully. From this point on the film becomes more and more interesting as we follow the different strategies Mr Nash develops in order to cope with his illness, some of which are successful, others are not.<br/><br/>Anyhow, to conclude, the film is a really great portrayal of somebody with a schizophrenic disorder (and I'm schizophrenic so I do have a clue - though I do doubt it is a degenerative disease as is suggested in the film) and everything from the acting to the scripting is really good and like I said, once you get past the first 45minutes of the film, the up to this point, merely passable film becomes a 4*(8/10) take on mental illness and of course John Nash's brilliant work."

","What got me interested in this film was I was told it is about schizophrenia. I found it didn't spoil the plot for me though, in fact, it made it more enjoyable because I was easily manipulated. I was trying to understand throughout what it was that made the protagonist, John Nash (Crowe) schizophrenic. Then, when it gets to the point where it's made clearer, that's not the end of it! The rest of the film shows how he lives with the illness.<br/><br/>This film starts off slow but it becomes a story of true love and determination. It answers the question, 'how do you get up from an all time low?' The ending almost brought a tear to my eye. One scene in particular is so tense, I nearly switched the film off! It just about made me shout aloud to the characters on screen. You will know what I'm on about when you see it. On the other hand, I do like Nash's chat-up lines. He's got more balls than me.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless, especially from Russell Crowe. He is so different in this compared to his other films. His character in this is more vulnerable and fearful. The casting is very well done when showing the main characters growing old. I don't think they changed the actors either which is remarkable.<br/><br/>As far as I know, this film is totally original and it's pretty realistic. Personally, I think it's far better than 'One flew over the Cuckoo's nest'. If you like this film, I recommend 'Shutter Island', the plot is unnerving but it has similar themes and it should manipulate you.<br/><br/>That's the thing with this film though, it will be completely different watching it a 2nd time. I haven't watched it a 2nd time yet because I put most of the pieces together in my head afterwards. However, I'm sure it will still be an enjoyable film."

","Just watched ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and am watching again. Ron Howard more than deserved his Academy Awards for Best Film and Best Director. What a truly beautiful movie. This is a dignified, tender, sympathetic portrait of a genius, a true genius. I've always known that genius is a person who can see the answer before the question, and this is perfectly exemplified and shown by Ron Howard. When Nash sees mathematical equations in the prisms of light from drinking glasses that match with a bad tie, to the long shadows cast by glasses forming columns of groups, to the movement and replacement of certain women in the bar, John Nash sees his answer. It's all there in front of him. <br/><br/>Ron Howard created a classic in this film.<br/><br/>This is a tender and accurate portrait of a genius, and a moving portrait of a schizophrenic.

","There's little doubt that ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an excellent film. There's also little doubt that it was buoyed from buzz to Oscar acclaim by hype, strategic PR, and a gullible public. Taken in and of itself the film is rather ordinary among excellent films and not worthy of much of the critical acclaim it garnered. I personally found much of the film uninteresting, tedious, and downright boring. After all, how does one relate to someone whose accomplishments are so abstract as to be buried in esoteric symbolism and someone whose illness is so intangible as to be a state of mind? The beauty of mathematics and the war with the demons of delusions were not brought sufficiently into focus by the film which spent too much time trying to develop a rather uninteresting character, making his delusions our delusions, spicing it up with a car chase and shootout, fleshing out the mental ghosts, and showing the principal's eccentricism with endless scribbling on window glass. Compensate for the hype, keep expectations low, and enjoy."

","This movie has a little bit of everything- creativity, romance, a love that truly is for better or for worse, suspense, action, and taste. I have to admit- before this movie, I was never really a Russell Crowe fan, due in part to his reputation for being arrogant and obnoxious. I really went to see the movie because Jennifer Connelly and I are the same age and I grew up seeing her face in Sears' catalogs, never having seen any of her acting performances. But when I saw Russell and the enormity of acting talent he put forth in this movie, I was completely blown away. How wrong I was for opinionating myself and using my opinion to decide whether or not I would see any of his movies. This movie impressed me so much that I went out and rented all the Russell Crowe movies available to me, and all I can say is: Boy have I missed out through the years. His true personality radiates in every character he plays, and he was surely the right choice for the lead in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Jennifer Connelly was outstanding as Alicia Nash, and together, her and Russell were a ""Beautiful Pair"". Paul Bettany was also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone in any age group, due in large part to the message it conveys- a beautiful mind, a mind that can appreciate the deeper things that most of us can't, can be a troubled one, and those closest to that""beautiful mind"" should never give up hope and keep close in mind the important things in life- compassion, long-suffering, and most of all: L-O-V-E. <br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>2001 136 minutes Rated: PG-13 CC."

","I first watched this film when it had an advanced preview before its wide release. I liked the film but it did not feel it was a Best Picture Oscar winner and I believe screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is a hack of the worst kind. Well he did write Batman & Robin and here explains 'Game Theory' in terms of picking women up at bars which should had been enough to disqualify him for an Oscar win.<br/><br/>Over the years the film's disparity with actual true events has been an issue with a lot of people. The trouble is nearly all films tend to be fictionalised for dramatic effect and A Beautiful Mind I guess is no better or worse but to me felt like a film loosely based on some true facts.<br/><br/>I recently re-watched the film and planned to review it. The death of John and Alicia Nash in a traffic accident focused my mind on the review.<br/><br/>What I took away from my reviewing of A Beautiful Mind was Nash as played by Russell Crowe being surprised by the varied use of the Game Theory principles in the world of commerce. It makes the hackneyed attempt to explain this theory by Goldsman make it look even more inept. I actually find myself thinking of how Game Theory applies in real life with things like sport rights television auctions.<br/><br/>Once upon a time one channel would buy up exclusive rights to soccer. A winner take all attitude which presumably led to underhand tactics such as bribery.<br/><br/>Now you have packages sold to various TV channels, which means several channels in one country will show live soccer at different times and days with another channel having highlights and the soccer authorities maximising their revenue. The poor punter gets even more poorer though having to pay more in subscription payments!<br/><br/>On the weekend that Nash died I even thought if Game Theory could apply in things like peace talks. Were the South African Truth and Reconciliation hearings just another application of Game Theory put in practice?<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind kind of overlooks the most important part Nash work and really places it as a footnote.<br/><br/>What we have is Russell Crowe playing the most muscular, dull/shy Ivy league mathematician you will ever get to meet in a film whose depiction of mental illness borrows heavily from the hit movie released several years earlier, The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>You kind of lulled into a false sense of security before you are hit in the gut with a sucker punch, but eh, this is a film of a man who suffered from mental illness. I saw the punch coming.<br/><br/>You then see Nash regaining his self, his worth and his wife. He returns to academia and gains academic acceptance with a Noble prize.<br/><br/>The film is watchable, there are some nice flourishes put in by Ron Howard the director but it feels less substantial than its critical acclaim suggests which includes an Oscar for best picture.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a picture of a man where they give you the biography but miss out on his thinking."

I probably understood this more than a fair amount of people because I am well aware of the disease and its symptoms, as one of my family members is plagued with the illness. I believe to enjoy this film to a greater extent, I recommend researching schizophrenia and the symptoms. You will notice more minor points throughout the film which show off some of the less severe symptoms.

Denzel Washington played Hurricane Carter in his film, The Hurricane, and the film was blasted by critics because the screen writer had to take some ""creative liberties"" in telling the story. Murder in the First, the story based on Henri Young's prison time at Alcatraz was also lamblasted because of ""creative libertes."" Murder in the First did poorly at the box office because of certain film critics let it be known that it took such liberities. Yet these same critics shouted Hosannas over A Beautiful Mind deliberately over looking the ""facts"" that the main character was homosexual and that his wife was a Spanish woman. And to add insult to injury, the actress playing his wife won an Academy Award. Several Spanish actresses commented that how little roles came their way and that this role would have been just what was needed. Sure, some readers will probably say ""so, what.""! it was the story that counted. And that would be true except that it was not the real story about the genius. What with Ron Howard one would expect nothing less than him changing the wife to a white woman. All in all, A Beautiful Mind might have been an Academy Award picture but it's pure fraud. But that's Hollywood and American critics for you. I hope some viewers will see this in it's true light."

","This film should not win the academy award for Best Picture or Best Adapted Screenplay because it was neither this year. A true candidate for Best Picture wouldn't leave out significant events of a person's life.

"EThompsonUMD","7","2","5","10 February 2002"," An unusually complex and adventurous Hollywood biopic.
","An unusually complex and adventurous Hollywood biopic, A Beautiful Mind, starring Russell Crowe as Nobel Laureate John Nash, is a likely 2001 Best Picture nominee  and given its Academy-pleasing inspirational-triumph-over-disability main story line, I wouldn't be surprised if it took the whole enchilada.<br/><br/>The film's early scenes are richly scripted (and daringly slow paced) to establish Nash's mathematical genius. We listen to him talk math with his fellow 1940s graduate students at Princeton University. We try to follow his obsessive problem solving on windows and any other handy surface. More mysteriously, we observe him observing group dynamics from pigeons to barflies, moving, we ultimately learn, ever more profoundly toward his Adam Smith-revising epiphany. All this is done with enough surface realism to convince us that the character is actually doing what he is supposed to be so good at  a much more difficult task when the character's accomplishments are mainly ratiocinative (writers, philosophers, and scientists) than when the character leaves a physical mark on society (artists, soldiers, politicians). If nothing else, A Beautiful Mind will provoke many viewers into looking up the mathematical/economic theories of the real John Nash. <br/><br/>Complicating this tale of genius (and, of course, attracting Hollywood to it), is Nash's decades-long descent into, and recovery from, serious mental illness. While the film's depiction of schizophrenia continues to receive praise from the mental health community for its accuracy and sympathy, the stylistic approach walks a line  not always soberly  between effective drama and preternatural hokum lifted from The Sixth Sense. Since the director (Ron Howard) carefully restricts the film's first two acts to Nash's point of view, the audience has little or no means of perceiving the increasing paranoid madness that envelopes the character, especially given the generally paranoia-producing milieu of post- World War II American society. For much of the movie, in fact, the plot seems to be following the 'just because I'm-paranoid doesn't mean that they are NOT out to get me' formula of many a Hollywood political thriller, most elaborately illustrated/parodied in Conspiracy Theory.<br/><br/>But in an inspired moment of Hitchcockian reversal, the last act shifts the point of view to Nash's wife as she discovers (and thereby we also discover) that her husband is truly insane. Ironically, Nash manages to break himself out of his subjective prison by marshaling his logical powers to the examination of a crucial piece of 'data' that leads ineluctably to the proof of his own madness. Upon this Cartesian foundation and with the help of his heroically loyal wife (Jennifer Connelly), Nash spends the years leading up to and beyond his Nobel Prize in Economics warding off the demons of delusion through the concentrated application of reason. <br/><br/>Despite a little overblown sentimentality in its final scenes, A Beautiful Mind delivers some interesting existential observations about the powers as well as limits of love and reason as momentary stays against the confusions of mind and society. And if it turns out to be this year's Best Picture Award recipient, well, it certainly won't be the least worthy one in recent years."

","I saw this movie expecting this film to be worthless trash. But, I am wrong, as usual. The main character in this story is a real person named John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who is depicted by Russell Crowe. After he is involved in a conspiracy, he develops insanity and he remains that way for about 40-45 years. This film won four Oscars including Best Picture and I say that this film deserves it. The acting was incredible especially with Crowe, Bettany, Plummer, and Harris. The script was written well and that means the storyline worked well. I also liked the score by James Horner. The music got things rolling in the movie. I recommend this film for all ages. I rate this film a 9/10."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","6","3 September 2006"," ""A"" for Acting, ""B"" for Story, ""C"" for Accuracy  that adds up to a ""B"", right?
","It feels pretty paltry and dry to grade a film on accuracy  especially since ""A Beautiful Mind (2001)"" is a dramatization and not a documentary. But when the director not only chooses to omit significant aspects of its biographical figure but richly glosses over almost everything in his life in a lush Hollywood coating up for Academy praise, then I as John Nash, would feel pretty stiffed at seeing the end result. But then I am not John Nash  I'm just a movie-goer looking to be entertained, touched and inspired in some way, and I was 2 out 3.<br/><br/>These two points are difficult to pinpoint, but I would attribute one of them to the acting in the film, which is sensationally layered and realistic from all parties. Russell Crowe may be a jerk in real life, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen and he is very convincing as genius-mathematician-turned-schizophrenic John Nash. We follow his career and his life starting out at Princeton, getting married, and ending up in Stockholm, heartily accepting the Nobel Prize. He ages 47 years in the film but Russell Crowe is perfect at every stage.<br/><br/>So the film makes it clear to us that John Nash is a genius man. Yet I was never mesmerized by his 'beautiful' mind  not in the same way I was with other cinematic geniuses in films like Good Will Hunting, Pi, Enigma and Amadeus. This is because you cannot trace his mathematical thoughts, we do not get to follow his genius pattern ideas and oh, when he draws an umbrella-shape in the stars for Alicia (Connelly) IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN UMBRELLA. At all. It looks like a couple of dots, sorry. Very romantic, poignant moment though.<br/><br/>While this sounds like a happy and acknowledged life, it is everything but for John Nash. He is the victim of schizophrenia, which makes him paranoid, delusional and insecure. He is never at 'the height of his career', but always a bruised man plagued by his own mind. It just takes him a while to realise it and shake him from his paranoid state. This part is handled superbly in the film -- the break-down is perfect and heartfelt and Jennifer Connelly is there as a supporting wife all along.<br/><br/>That actually bothered me somewhat, and it is where the glossy Hollywood autopilot is switched on and Ron Howard leans back in his directing chair. While Russell Crowe is great and Jennifer Connelly is great, their marriage is TOO great. The real Alicia Nash wasn't the pretty little devoted wife to a troubled husband all these years; she divorced him in 1963. Another polished detail that irked me (moreso than the perfect marriage) was the Nobel Prize culmination. The real John Nash shared his prize with two others, but in the film Russell Crowe appears as a sole winner giving a poignant, sappy speech about ""the equations of love"", and the audience cheers, claps and stands up at the end of it.<br/><br/>So in summary, if you do not mind the occasional lofty Hollywood approaches to drama, then this is a very good film. Russell Crowe carries it, Jennifer Connelly supports it and Ed Harris and Paul Bettany add further weight to an already respected cast. It is a well-sewn together product with nice cinematic harmony and my favourite aspect was the subtle nuances in John Nash's delusions that distinguished them from reality. You can spot this at the beginning if you pay attention.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"mmunier","8","2","6","15 January 2006"," You've seen a summary many times
","Although I very much enjoyed the movie, there were a few things that held me back. Russel Crows unlike in ""The insider"" is too much Russel Crows for my liking and I probably would appreciate more an unknown actor for the part. The other drawback, I have spent most of my working life in mental institutions as a nurse; although I do appreciate RC's effort to mimic schizophrenia it did not work for me and I had to imagine it was OK to go with the story. I remember having similar feelings for Jack Nicholson in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Mental illness is not often very glamorous or entertaining (but nonetheless, yes it has its moments!) I wonder though if the movie had any influence on mental illness services anywhere in the world? I would guess, probably not. Mb"
"gftbiloxi","5","2","6","24 April 2005"," Adept Performances Redeem Uneven Film
","Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and an strong supporting cast offer extraordinary performances in A BEAUTIFUL MIND--and fortunately so, for the subject of the film has undergone a Hollywood homogenization that renders the film both timid and tepid. Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.<br/><br/>The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE and THE OTHERS; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow. Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition. It has ""santitized for your protection"" feel typical of director Ron Howard's work.<br/><br/>But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish. I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends. Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine. This is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, and I recommend it on that basis.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","While this film is very moving in its own right a more daring film that didn't ignore the thornier aspects of Nash's life would have been better. Nash's delusions were more outlandish than the film suggests; he thought he was in contact with aliens for example. Likewise, he had affairs (and was arrested for public indecency), was quite mean at times and was possibly anti-Semitic. Nash in the film is too pitiable and awkward to really capture the tenor of this stuff. The resulting film isn't bad but it lacks real weight as a result.<br/><br/>I do rather like the trick the screenplay and direction pull off in regards to Nash's delusions vis-a-vis the viewer's expectations. It is an effective, through probably inaccurate, way to capture what paranoia feels like. Howard stages the action in that classic Hollywood way that makes the story involving.<br/><br/>The film largely succeeds on Crowe's and Connelly's winning performance.

"midas-jacobs","9","1","2","25 October 2015"," ""What truly is logic?""
","There are going to be some spoilers in here, but the movie is based on a true story so you can consider this as non spoilers. <br/><br/>""A beautiful mind"" is about John Nash. A brilliant, but antisocial man. The movie starts of with him going to the university where he meets Charles, who becomes his best friend. At some point in the movie he gets offered a job, to work in cryptography. He accepts this job but it turns out to be a bad decision which changes his life...<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Ron Howard, believe me or not, that is the same guy who did ""The Da Vinci Code"". I was very surprised too. It was very well directed in comparison to ""The Da Vinci Code"". I didn't like that movie at all, but I still gave it a 6/10 because I liked the book. The cinematography was also handled great. It was done by 'legend' Roger Deakins. This man is just amazing at his job every shot was really beautiful. The scene I personally thought was the best cinematographed was the scene where Charles and Nash were standing on the roof, how the camera flowed was just so pretty, the dialogue in this scene was also very good, this was my favorite scene. But not only in this scene is the movement of the camera good, this applies to almost all of the scenes. Which has a pretty outcome. What I didn't really like was how they used the orange collar scheme. it did make the movie look old, which I think they were aiming for, but I personally think it didn't look too good. The creativity put in to this movie was also very good. Like when Nash and Alicia are outside of a building and look up to the sky. Then Nash says that she must pick a shape and she tells him the shape of a umbrella, what I liked about this scene is how they lit up the stars that formed the umbrella. The also do this at times when Nash is cracking codes. It was overall cool to see how he unravels the codes. The make- up was very good, how they made Crowe look old was just so good.<br/><br/>The acting of the movie was also amazing. Russel Crowe was by far the best. He played John Nash. He did an amazing job to portray him, and you could really believe that he was antisocial. You can see this in the beginning of the movie very well. Jennifer Connelly played Alicia. Alicia was the love interest of Nash. She was also good. She was a worried wife to him, and she nailed acting like one. Paul Bettany. His character I liked the most. He played Charles, a funny, caring, friend. And when he turned out to not be real I was shocked (a bit more about this twist further on in the review). Paul was also very good. Ed Harris played the 'Boss' off Nash when he started to work in cryptography. He was also good, but he was my least favorite character. There is also Adam Goldberg, he also played in the TV-show Fargo and in Saving Pravite Ryan. In this movie he did a good acting job, even though I think he was better in Fargo. You also have some smaller role characters, and they did the best they could. Overall the acting was good, but I was more blown away by Russel Crowes performance<br/><br/>The script was good too. You can see this, by how easily you are convinced that Nash is antisocial. You can also feel the friendship that has bred between Nash and Charles, which makes it more heartbreaking to see him say goodbye to Charles. They also had some great chemistry. There were also some funny moments that broke the dramatic tone, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The twist in the middle of the movie was just mind blowing, I didn't see that coming, but I could have guessed. Because Charles was never at parties (in the beginning of the movie) but then he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I definitely liked the twist, because it wasn't anything really predictable, like it is in most movies. But if you did some research you also could have known that it was all fake. Because of the writing and acting, you almost immediately cared about Nash, whereby it wad more sad to watch. Even though it is a drama it has some good romance in it to, what I didn't expect.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review. I enjoyed watching this film, and would recommend this to other people. The ending is beautiful too. <br/><br/>""What truly is logic"""

My personal opinion about the cast for certain actors is debatable, for example Paul Bethany as Charles. However i automatically fell in love with Jennifer Connelly that delivers a stunning performance as Alicia Nash. <br/><br/>The story line is deep and meaningful keeping viewers attention until the credits roll.

","Until a few hours ago, I had never had a real ""experience"" watching a film, however, A Beautiful Mind changed that. I felt so many emotions while I watched it, joy, anxiety, fear, anger and excitement, to state a few. This movie truly absorbed me, I was transfixed until the end credits, and it's one of the only films that moved me, it really hit me to the core. <br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is the story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a genius mathematician, he is an anti-social guy and very awkward at times. And the film follows his story. After a series of events, John is diagnosed with schizophrenia and his life falls apart, however his story does not end on a sad note. Now this is just a quick breakdown of the whole thing, there are many other events that occur in between (obviously), and all of them are memorable, in part due to the emotional story and even more due to the fantastic acting. The way the film shows the grief and burden that is brought upon Nash and the people closest to him due to his schizophrenia is the film's biggest success, in my opinion. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is stupendous, every single actor in the movie does an incredible job, especially of course, the brilliant Russell Crowe. This man is a wizard of an actor, his portrayal of John Nash is quite frankly the best acting I have ever seen in my life, the fact that he didn't win an Oscar for this portrayal made me give up on the Academy entirely. There is no doubt in this world that Crowe embodied Nash on every level, his walk, voice and face are all amazing, even more so after discovering his ""problem"". Jennifer Connelly plays John's wife, Alicia, a very emotionally charged character, with all the hardships she has to go through, and Connelly portrays her just like that, very powerful acting, there's a scene where she freaks out in the bathroom, one word, stunning. The rest of the supporting cast are also great, Ed Harris, as a secret agent, Paul Bettany as John's best friend, Charles and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Rosen, a psychiatrist who treats John's disorder.<br/><br/>The screenplay is superb, every piece of dialogue is amazing, nothing in the movie feels out of place or redundant. The entire film is shot masterfully by Ron Howard, who manages to keep the viewers engaged through the entire film, and making the audience experience the mental illness that John suffers from by putting us in his point of view. And the film does have many, many touching moments, the ending hit me very hard, however the most beautiful and heart-warming scene was the pen ceremony. It was too much, seeing him get acknowledged by all his peers in that way, with the moving music in the back, the whole piece brought tears to my eyes. One of my favorite scenes ever, for this alone, Howard deserved many awards and endless praise. <br/><br/>I cannot stress how amazing this film is, it made me feel so many things throughout its run time, however by the time the credits rolled, the feeling that prevailed was absolute joy, for having had such an amazing time. To me, A Beautiful Mind was not just a film, it was a true experience, a beautiful film, and a masterpiece in every sense of the word, it is the best film I have ever seen in my entire life."

He forgot the part of being a human which is dealing with people not only with equations. His personality could be affected by the way that his family raised him they may not encourage him to socialize, they didn't build his personality correctly or his parents died when he was young so that affected him badly. <br/><br/>During university life his problem become more complicated his mind started to fill the missing part of his life by making a close friend that is not exist. Then after graduation when he didn't get the attention that he was expected to his scientific talent, he made out that important role. After getting married and his psychological problem was discovered I think the psychiatry treatment had a negative and a positive effect on him. The positive part of it is that now he knew that he has a problem, because if his wife told him that he had a problem he may not be able to believe her. But the negative part is that psychiatry treatment makes the patient feel that he is ""psycho"" no one would like to be attacked all the time. The atmosphere in the hospital was not helping him to be fine he got an aggressive medical treatment. <br/><br/>I think that the psychological treatment is a very good way in dealing with those kinds of cases, because it helps the patients to be able to take decisions, to be engaged with others and to find the solution to the problem that they have.I think that what helped him most is the psychological treatment, because he felt that his wife love him and she encouraged him, so he tried his best to be better. Also the role of his friends was very important, because he started to fill the friends ""social"" part and the part of practicing science again. Finally his wife is the key for his success, because she made the other half of his heart that was missing back to him."
"ericrnolan","9","1","2","3 October 2014"," I finally saw ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), and I really liked it.
","It had a fantastic script with great performances by Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Adam Goldberg. I'd give it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I had no idea that Crowe was this good of an actor. He had a ""Rain Man"" role in this film, in which an established actor can show his range by portraying a mentally ill person. Yet even his terrific performance here was maybe outshined by Harris'. I don't know what it is about Harris  but he grows on you. He's a great actor, even in a somewhat one-note role like the one he has here. He can be forceful and intimidating, and even genuinely frightening, but also sympathetic at the same time. (See his performances in ""The Stand"" miniseries (1994) or that Saturday-afternoon, guilty-pleasure standby, ""The Rock"" (1996).) Plus he's just got a damned cool voice. And those crazy-ass eyes that bore right through you. Seriously, if Ed Harris were your Dad, would you ever f%#@ up as a teenager? Ever? I would never come home late with beer on my breath, EVEN IF ED HARRIS WERE AN OUT-OF-STATE UNCLE.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's directing was good – very good. Still, I couldn't help comparing him with other directors who have a genius for this kind of source material. This is a movie where the main character comes to doubt his perceptions of reality – when I think of films like ""12 Monkeys,"" ""Vanilla Sky"" or ""Jacob's Ladder,"" I couldn't help but wonder if their directors really would have given a tour de force with this story's fantastic elements. Think about it  if Terry Gilliam had directed ""A Beautiful Mind,"" wouldn't this great movie be even better?<br/><br/>All in all, though, this was an excellent film. I cheerfully recommend it."
"braddugg","8","1","2","19 September 2014"," A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.
","A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.<br/><br/>How could I put this, is it the best display of a schizophrenic patient or a biopic of a mathematician who went on to win a Nobel against many odds of his own hallucinations. This is both, and indeed this movie is of John Nash (Russell Crowe) and his story of becoming one of the finest mathematicians ever who has influenced a big deal in research of various subjects.<br/><br/>Now, 5 minutes into a film we know there is mysterious, he fights with a friend whom others don't see now this very figment of imagination is blown out of proportion by his own mind and he goes through too many things. Now, that interesting, so there is a man who has hallucinations of seeing people, he is a real man and he has a story that is interesting nevertheless. So, Ron Howard picked it up and transformed into a better one using the screenplay which I must say is engaging in most parts as those hallucinations keep coming back. The other part is naturally mundane as those are the regular events which might happen to anyone.<br/><br/>Here, I mean wining Nobel prize does not happen to anyone, yet winning a nobel having such delusions is what made Nash special and that's what made this whole film special. It's tough to be understanding what Nash actually is and why is Nash, the way he is. <br/><br/>We are not shown of his birth nor his upbringing, we see him walk into a college as student and begin his journey there. So, there re still few questions unanswered but I would still say this a great watch and better leave those unanswered questions behind, coz the answers might have killed the interest. <br/><br/>The cinematography is great and so is the sound and the art design, all are at their place and there is an impetus given by the screenplay itself which I must say is near to something of masterpiece. Yet, it may have its shortcomings as I felts some scenes are overdone just to create an impact. So editing could have been crisper. <br/><br/>Above all, a memorable performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly take this movie into a different altitude altogether and that's the reason both have deservedly won many awards. Also, a word about the wonderful blu-ray that provided such remarkable details.<br/><br/>It's a 4/5 for a movie that I must say is great and if not anything watch Russell Crowe alone perform John Nash and its worth all the time and money."
"axel-koch","9","1","2","19 March 2014"," A beautiful film, rich with able filmmaking and gripping storytelling
","A Beautiful Mind is an outstanding cinematic achievement. On one hand, that is because of truly Oscar-worthy filmmaking in every possible aspect, but on the other, graver hand, this is due to it introducing a mass audience to mental disorders. As all but an expert on this topic, I'm in no position to assess whether the film is realistic and respectful to actual patients, but bringing people closer to the minds of schizophrenics and other mentally ill by making a star-studded Hollywood film out of their perspective is rating praise already.<br/><br/>Ron Howard realized a great mixture of drama, romance, action, and humour with A Beautiful Mind, something many directors attempt to do nowadays, clearly resulting from the award-winning prospect it brings along, but only very few succeed in. Story-wise, the film is immensely entertaining, touching, and just as beautiful as its title suggests. Another major merit of the four-time Oscar winner is its lead actor Russell Crowe, going from heroic action star in Gladiator to socially awkward genius in just two years. He performs extraordinarily in both productions, but his portrayal of the real-life figure John Nash is a far greater achievement. His on-screen partners do wonderful work as well, even if some of the characters do conform to stereotypes.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is of no lesser quality, capturing the past times the story is set in in gorgeous colours and imaginative shots, such as Paul Bettany defenestrating a desk out in Princeton's snowed campus or the seasons passing outside while John is working on the theory of his lifetime. All of that is accompanied by a James Horner score as melodic and fitting as hardly any other in film history and one that is also a pleasure to listen to on its own.<br/><br/>Thus, A Beautiful Mind is a more than deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars and a film worth watching more than once."
"SnoopyStyle","8","1","2","22 February 2014"," Russell Crowe proves his acting versatility
","This movie starts in 1947 Princeton where John Nash (Russell Crowe) is trying to start his career. He is not impressed with anybody else there, and searches for an original idea. He is awkward and very peculiar. Then one night at a bar, a tall blonde and her friends walk in. It gives him an idea to overturn Adam Smith's theory. This allows him a placement in the Wheeler Labs in MIT. Years later working at MIT, he meets student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) who would eventually become his wife, and the mysterious William Parcher (Ed Harris) from the DOD.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe has been a leading man for awhile but this one proves once and for all his versatility. He is amazing throughout giving a praise worthy performance. Jennifer Connelly makes a great entrance as she shows her brains as well as her beauty. Director Ron Howard is spot on with this movie. He allows Crowe the space to lead. It's a very human character. It's the best picture Oscar winner for a good reason."

","I am an electronics engineer and during the course at first I felt I had enough time to explore mathematics to its entirety, and it was proved so awfully wrong in such style by the most basic patterns and behaviours--real numbers. Disgruntled, I watched this movie and Oh, my Gosh! Mathematics makes so common and simple things so overwhelmingly profound. What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story. Russel and Jennifer are immaculate and almost seem like living it all through. The part I can't keep from mentioning is how story-writer made their romance look so perfect; it often isn't this perfect for mathematicians because their expressions are just different."

","John Nash is a quiet, introverted man. A brilliant person who doesn't quite fit in. His roommate Charles is always there to help him get through the difficult times in his life at university. Russell Crowe is, again fantastic in portraying John Nash. With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information. Directed by Ron Howard ( Robin Hood,3:10 to Yuma and Apollo 13 ), A Beautiful Mind is one of the few movies based on a real life, that actually translates into A Beautiful Movie."

","I think that it is a very good movie. I really think that Russell Crowe does a great job in portraying mental illness as a very real and harsh thing to have to live with. I think that One problem that I did have with it was that it really did not accurately portray schizophrenia very well. In the movie John Nash was clearly having visual hallucinations, which is really not that common in real life and the real John Nash even said that he never had visual hallucinations. However I guess that this just to make the movie more interesting. It would have been more boring if he was just having auditory hallucinations. I think that my favorite scene is when he first meets Dr. Rosen (who is my favorite character) at the math council and John Nash things that he is a Russian spy. That is a good part especially when the people run after him and shoot tranquilizers into his leg."

","I watched this DVD at my son's recommendation. I had no idea what to expect. As a university professor I was interested in the picture of academia in the 50's. The film then started to lose it's way. It threatened to deteriorate into a Hollywood spy thriller. The brilliant mathematician (John Nash) hired by dumb spooks. Just as my interest waned it turned out that the secret undercover work was actually a paranoid schizophrenic fantasy. Having being confronted by this debilitating mental dysfunction at close hand (my sister) for most of my life, the film became suddenly captivating. Here and there stereotype Hollywoood sentimentality prevents the film from becoming a really great film, but it remained stimulating and moving right through to the end. The next day I checked out the movie content with a genuine biography and interview with John Nash himself. The movie is not entirely accurate - Nash never actually had visual delusions, but he did experience voices. In the movie Nash is stabilizes and continues to take medication. In reality he has not taken medication for the last thirty years."

","I just have to say that only people who didn't read the book before seeing this movie can appreciate it, because it was so far from the book as to be comical. Yes, Nash was/is nuts, and figuring out a way to explain the inside of a crazy genius's head is a difficult challenge, however, I think they were way off the mark if the biographical book is to be believed.<br/><br/>Also, the hollywoody way that the film makers kept his wife constant out of her great love and pity for him was also a ruse. Once again, Hollywood whored up history for a buck. I will concede that it might have been entertaining without prior knowledge of the subject matter, but why call it true then? Why not just make a made up movie about a screwed up mathematician and not attach it to the life of a real person? <br/><br/>As a venue for pitying the beautiful and distraught it is top drawer, but nothing more."

","How did this boring movie ever win an Oscar for best picture? It should have been 4 hours long. The version released to theaters feels like half the story has been chopped out. I found neither Nash nor his wife interesting, the math and numbers angle was dull, and the schizophrenic plot felt unresolved  And how Connelly won best supporting actress is beyond me. She adds nothing to the picture beyond a devoted wifely duty role that any of a hundred actresses could have fleshed out the same way. Where one should be moved, one is attempted to laugh, and Crowe just seems miscast. I thought this was one of the Academy awards biggest mistakes, next to voting Lawrence of Arabia and the even more over rated The Greatest Show on Earth best pictures. If you want to see Opie direct a much better flick, check out Apollo 13. This one will just put you to sleep. The only decent characters are the ones Nash imagines in his intense paranoia. The real life characters are pale and non descript beside them."

"EEMargolin","6","1","2","7 July 2002"," A Beautiful Story Told Poorly
","While I deeply appreciate the contribution of Mr. Howard and the other contributors to this project to deal with difficult subject matter, I find there are many critiques I would choose to offer.  The license the film maker takes to entertain us leaves many truths of this story stretched far beyond the reasonable.  It troubles me that a serious film maker would make such flaws as are made with issues relating to facts that are easily verifiable.  For example, lectures are given prior to the awarding of a Nobel Prize, and acceptance speeches are never given.  Dramatic license is one thing, but his speech could have been written into the script in hundreds of other places, rather than leaving the masses with blatant misrepresentations.<br/><br/>I adored the performances of the two main characters, though Ms. Connelly could have been given so much more.  Mrs. Nash is half of the story of Mr. Nash,  and yet her character was reduced to being two dimensional at best.  Mr. Howard and the screen writers all but ignored secondary characters, letting them stand merely as bridges to move from one main point to the next. This is completely irresponsible film making.  Has Mr. Howard become so comfortable and confident that he has forgotten what it's like to take risks?  I think he's the epitome of everything that is wrong with American film.  It's long on safe choices, short on quality of development.  <br/><br/>I enjoy Mr. Howard's films for basic entertainment and storytelling value, and he does have a wonderful eye for background detail, among many of his other unmentioned talents.  I think he has promise, but his films are beginning to cater so much more to the masses than to true and honest work.  This leaves me both sad and bitter, because he could be a great director if he really allowed himself to take chances.  <br/><br/>He plays it safe, and for that audiences adore him and he makes a studio very happy.  No doubt he will be regarded as one of the top directors of our time, but this regard does not make the fact true.  He could be so much more, and I for one keep paying to see that happen because I have hope.  Yet with each passing film, I find the same tired tread of someone who wants to make a spectacular commercially successful film, that I want to ask him to please do something incredible.  Ed Harris looks like he's becoming bored with his one dimensional sideline characters in all of his Howard films, and this is not fitting for such a wonderful talent.   Only two characters were allowed to really shine, and certainly they deserve their acclaim, if for no other reason than the direction is stale.<br/><br/>The script was decent, but left so many incredible wholes that I can't imagine why it took nearly two and a half hours to tell this wonderful story of John and Alicia Nash.  It's taken me a few days to digest how unsatisfying I felt.  I became too dazzled by the two main characters o see the incredible flaws, and I can only feel sorry that this important story was not only a poor representation of Mr. And Mrs. Nash, but much fictionalized for dramatic license.  <br/><br/>
This film should have been given to a more capable team, such as Steven Soderbergh or P.T. Anderson, or even Hal Hartley.  I think the film wouldn't have been as successful commercially, but artistically and for story content, this would have been a much better movie.  To Mr. Howard, I give the big raspberry.  Boo, I say. <br/><br/>Boo."

In the beginning, everything about Charles is perfectly<br/><br/>plausible and consistent.  The second time I watched, I looked<br/><br/>carefully for any hints that he wasn't real.  The first thing I could find<br/><br/>was that he overheard Nash's remark about fluid exchange, even<br/><br/>though Nash spoke too quietly for anyone to overhear.

I see this as deliberate deception of the<br/><br/>audience.  (Notice that after Nash's hospitalization, there are no<br/><br/>more examples of the imaginary characters manipulating real<br/><br/>objects.)<br/><br/>Perhaps Nash's brilliance is reflected by the fact that in the early<br/><br/>stages, he could create a completely consistent and plausible<br/><br/>delusion.

I told myself that I would put all that aside, however, and try to see the movie as simply a good story.<br/><br/>So much for that approach.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be pretty boring and unfulfilling.  They spend very little time on character development and even if you haven't read about the parts of Nash's story that were left out of the movie, it still feels like something is missing.<br/><br/>Nash is supposed to be some kind of unrivaled genius, but aside from watching Russell Crowe stare at many terribly complicated equations (no doubt written onto library windows and chalk boards by graduate students who happened by the set during filming) we get very little sense of what it was that this guy did that was so earth shattering.<br/><br/>If they had bothered to go more into Nash's game theory work, the movie could have been a lot more impressive and interesting.  As it is, we are left to take on faith that Nash's theories about maximizing his and his friends chances of getting laid must have been Nobel caliber stuff.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is no explanation at all about what on earth it is about Nash (a confirmed misanthrope) that could possibly make his wife fall in love with him, much less spend her entire life as the care-taker of the nuthouse that is Nash's life.  Note: had they felt inclined to include the fact that Nash and his wife were separated for a while, it might make the picture a little more believable.<br/><br/>Maybe she knew that she would win Best Supporting Actress if she stuck around long enough.<br/><br/>Once again, I am disappointed in the Academy's Best Picture selection."

However, upon watching an above average though not brilliant film like ""A Beautiful Mind"", one temporarily forgets the poem thumper ever existed and start appreciating his genuine talent as a mean(but not so lean) acting machine.<br/><br/>In portraying the Nobel Prize winning math genius, John Nash, Russell Crowe has to assume not just the role of a clever bloke, but also a man lacking adequate social graces and political etiquette(much like the real life actor). On top of that, Mr Crowe has to flesh out the plight of a man plagued by insanity. You see, John Nash also suffered from schizophrenia, a condition which render its victim delusional, paranoid and slowly losing grip with reality.<br/><br/>As this was a straight forward biography of John Nash, a full narrative arc, spanning decades, was presented to the audience. It detailed his genius, the onset of his condition, his spiralling into the depths of insanity, and his gradual path back on the road to recovery. Yet, nowhere in the film was I distracted with the timeline nor the gradual personality shift in the man. All credit goes to Russell Crowe, THE ACTOR. For he delivered a powerful yet restrained performance. He captured our sympathies not with his nuanced mannerisms, bringing out subtle moments of brilliance and anguish. A performance so committed, one is astonished by its utter lack of vanity and artifice.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid, ex-husband of Meg Ryan, has this to say of THE ACTOR: ""Hey, he's a really good actor. I won't tell you what I think of him as a person, though.

In the movie he has this ability with numbers and uses mostly facial contortions to portray to us the fact that he is using his ability. Well as I watched this I thought `how could they possibly be talking Oscar for this guy' His acting was so painfully bad.<br/><br/>In one shot be bangs his head on the window (he acts like he just took a bullet to the groin) and it produces a spider crack in the glass. Well, he bled like a stuck pig, with a gash on his head O.J. would have been proud of. His roommate rushes over and gushes over him like Crowe was his love interest. Sickening.

I can only imagine that most of them are women who are infatuated with him, and would give two thumbs up if he played in say `The return of Pee Wee'. The acting from not only him but also most of his costars is so contrite and overacted it leaves one actually in shock as to how bad the movie is. The one bright spot as far as I could tell was Judd Hirsch. Who played a professor. Do your self a favor and wait till this stinker comes out on video and borrow it from the library."

"WesternUnion","4","1","2","15 February 2002"," Decent, but most definitely not Best Picture material
","Totally agree with the users speaking out on Russell Crowe Crowe and Jennifer Connelly (as eye-candy radiant as ever) for their easily superior turns in ""The Insider"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" (in turn easily superior to ""Mind""). Now, on to this picture, which I feel is the worst of the Best Picture nominees this year.....<br/><br/>Walking into the theatre beforehand I was well-aware the film was under a considerable amount of critical fire for glossing over Mr. Nash, the individual - making him out to be way too much of a saint - and his accomplishments. Now I must concede that - bearing in mind there's a great deal of validity to all those objections - however you want to cut it, film is just NOT the best medium to resort to for accuracy and factual glut to satisfy the average viewer. War extravaganzas like the recent ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" are glaring examples of such a fault.<br/><br/>But even looking past what the film is lacking in biographical substance (not very easy), there's not a whole lot in ""A Beautiful Mind"" to recommend here:<br/><br/>
* John Forbes Nash as Crowe capably inhabits him is awfully hard to care about from beginning to end, despite the fact that the actor labors hard to flesh Nash out. He's fighting a screenplay that is far more concerned with the delusions haunting him than anything as substantial as his real life, or who HE was.<br/><br/>* Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer, each a great actor in a rather thankless role.<br/><br/>* It painted a portrait of schizophrenia that came off as, for the most part, pedestrian next to others found in the likes of, say, Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" and ""Fight Club"".<br/><br/>* This portrait is worsened by moments supposed to incite laughter from the audience as a result of Nash's illness.<br/><br/>* It sprung a 'twist' halfway through that came off like lazy screenwriting or a half-baked rehash of the Revelation concerning people who don't actually exist, something Hollywood ought to retire for a while.<br/><br/>
* Not an iota of depth, but a good dose of superficiality, is to be found in the movie's depiction of why Mr. Nash was such a brilliant mathematician or what attracted Alicia Larde to him in the first place. Or why she put up with Nash so long. (Alicia is underwritten to such a great extent, you have to admire that Jennifer Connelly doesn't emerge as defeated from the screenplay as you would think, either.)<br/><br/>* It actually left me wondering, like many Miramax-backed yarns of late, whether the central motivation behind its making was to win Oscars - not exactly an uplifting feeling, but then again, I guess the movie must have failed in its obvious attempts near the end to inspire that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For all the faults of ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and several other films that didn't make the Best Picture cut, but should have, at least they didn't seem nearly as calculated, and had far more interesting methods of storytelling guiding them. (The fine Apollo 13 aside, I feel Ron 'Opie' Howard's talent is vastly overrated.) Neither did many of them seem to overstay their welcome as much as ""A Beautiful Mind"" (over 2 hours long).<br/><br/>There are spots where the movie simply DRAGS, and threatens to drag the viewer's opinion of the proceedings down with it, despite the valiant efforts of Crowe and Connelly to inject some interest factor into Akiva Goldsman's predictable screenplay (Golden Globe worthy my A$$). At times they almost succeeded. In the end, they are the only elements of the movie worth all the Oscar buzz. Should you be in search of an adequate starting showcase for their talent, but not much more, look no further and check this one out, but brace yourself for the running time."

","Slow and boring movie about a delusional mathematician which dont focus on the reality in the portrayed persons works. I dont like it because i dont like to look at a disturbed person and his experiences. If you want to see a real nice and fun movie, see scary movie 2 or something really funny like ""not another teen movie"". However, i dont see how one can try to go into this persons mind, this is just a quick glance at something of course more complex and involved than its room to place in a one and a half hour movie. Instead, you should study some psychology, and in that case use this movie for some kind of acknowledgment of your already learned knowledge. The mathematic aspect is, as expected, strongly simplified, and a kind of a crack kids high in the cloud fantasy. Why dont we see more of the interesting works of this man? Probably because one of two reasons. We already have one reason; the time aspect. This is acceptable, if you dont count on getting the priorities straight, because the obvious time limit of a long film. The other possibly reason is because the film makers is thinking not many people would be interested in a film, harrowing about boring mathematical problems. If that is true or not, can of course be discussed. I however believe its perfectly a necessary component in this kind of movie."

","""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of the most wonderful films I have seen in a long time.  It tells the story of mathematician John Nash and his rise to Princeton, to his fall with mental illness, to his rise as he overcomes his condition.  Russel Crowe's performance is certainly Oscar-worthy, becoming Nash on screen and realistically and emotionally portraying this character that is so different from others he has played on screen.  Ron Howard deserves a big nod, as well for successfully allowing the audience to get into Nash's mind and share with him his fears and relationships due to his mental condition.  Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris were also at their best in this film as supporting roles.  James Horner's music was both eerie and sympathetic to Nash's character and fit very well in the film.<br/><br/>See this movie, folks.  You'll be glad you did!  Bravo to all involved!"

If we are meant to feel compassion towards Russell Crowe's character because 'oh look he is a genius with a mental illness' then unfortunately I did not feel any empathy at all. The script is totally embellished which takes away its credibility. Also, most of what comes out of his mouth hardly warrants a title of 'A Beautiful Mind'. More like A Dirty Mind, a guy who just wants to get laid like everyone else. I didn't see the character doing anything special or significant that seemed 'beautiful' other than scrawling on his windowsill."

But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best as he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity. Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard has created a moving masterpiece, elegantly guiding the audience through John Forbes Nash Jr.'s life as it shows the triumph and tragedy of life, as well as the beauty of the human spirit to overcome and survive.Also,it one significant movie since it is uplifting, thought-provoking, and emotionally devastating look on both a love story and mental illness.And most of all,it is beautifully acted particularly by Connelly and Crowe,who completely disappears into the character of Nash which is one reason alone why this is a for highly recommended viewing."

","To all; When I first saw it, I wasn't the same. I couldn't shake the knowledge that I had seen for the first time in my life the same kinds of pictures and moving graphics of information that I have visualized everyday since I was 13 or so, (40 yrs ago). I also got the same reaction with the movie ""stranger than fiction"". But as I was watching it tonight again, identifying with the ache to be somebody significant and the hunger to understand it all (the governing dynamic), I finally saw a huge connection in the movie. To make it easy, run the film backwards in your head, Charlotte Church singing about someone who will protect, nurture, and ""see you through the night"", and then Nash's comments from the podium that his wife's love was what made all the logic possible. In every scene with Nash's wife she is in the guardian/caretaker role. Remember how smart she was- attempting to solve that unsolvable function - Nash said how elegant her work was.... The truth of the film is that Jennifer Connelly's character IS the Beautiful Mind - hers is the one that ordered his universe and her love that made his mind possible to carry on. Listen to the last 5 mins of the movie again.. It is clear. Now on the other hand - Howard is a great director and, as I said above, I see connections others don't - I always have. Maybe he didn't intend such a connection - but her steadfast, continual (in spite of her doubts) love and devotion (remember what she says when asked how she is doing)was the centering, pivotal presence in the movie. Her's was the Beautiful Mind."

The intelligence of Nash is obvious, and therefore it is no surprise that he discovers groundbreaking theories (his own original idea). However, the development of Nash is the centre of the entire picture, and Ron Howard has done a great job making these images possible. It's a great mystery to me that Crowe didn't win an academy award for this movie, his performance is excellent and flawless. The fact that Nash receives the Nobel Prize at the end of the movie shows us, the spectators, that with courage, heart, and soul our dreams are within reach. So therefore with the words of Crowe: ""It's possible!"""

Well that would be the fact that Dr. Nash has a Mental Health Disability. Now I'm not going to ruin things for you if you want to see the movie but I will say this...it is really well done. Ron Howard engineered the film in such a way to keep you guessing even when you feel you have a handle on things. Russell Crowe definitely gave the best performance of his life here. I still have a hard time believing that he gave the performance in the film. Jennifer Connelly also gives a good performance winning her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. In the end I have to say there is little wrong with this movie....<br/><br/>From a Mental Health Therapist point of view I still have some hesitance in showing it to the population I treat as the tendency to glamorize things and even seems to point of even saying that the man managed to beat things by taking care of himself and not accepting treatment where the book shows the opposite effect. I do try and point out that the man still takes medications to this day.

","The movie is not a very accurate biography of Nash's life. Nash's life was very painful according to the book. The movie only touches the outskirts of the pain his schizophrenia caused. The biggest problem of the movie is that Crowe portrays Nash probably far more likable than Nash actually was durng his illness. Crowe has a charisma that the real Nash probably does not have. The movie is a Hollywood movie. It is glitzy and stylish. However, I think Howard has done an admirable job in storytelling. Crowe portrayed Nash well. Nash was althletic looking and handsome when he was younger. Howard had synthesize the whole story in a couple hours and I think he told the story in a very powerful way. Schizophrenics are delusional partly because their view of the universe makes them the center of the universe. Their role in their universe is very important to them. The movie also reveals the torment of the treatment and the drugs they used back then to treat schizophrenia. Connelly was beautiful and very convincing as the wife. I enjoyed the movie immensely.

","How can a schizophrenic be of such genius and function at such a level that he commands the highest honor given to human beings, the Oslo awards given for work that progresses mankind, the Nobel Prize for Scientific Excellence. The judges there go to great levels to prevent the awards from being denigrated by going to some charlatan, as the knighthoods of England have become.<br/><br/>Having now seen the documentary on this exceptional man's life, I understand more about the particular life a schizophrenic lives. Even the physical structure of his skull somehow creates the 'voices', which of course is Mr. Nash speaking to himself. Just as we are often beset by temptation, with cartoons showing the devil on one shoulder and an angel on another, such was the form these voices took for him. <br/><br/>What is even more amazing when we see his 'recovery' in the movie, is from his own admission, a product of his fantastic intelligence. He uses the 'faulty' organ, his brain, to figure out how to 'be sane', foregoing the drugs of the early years that caused him much psychic pain. The description of the experiments performed on him and his treatment in the New Jersey asylum are disgusting,much as the shocking treatments (literally and figuratively) being given children today in Canton, Ma. The mothers of his sons were given proper credit for staying with him, despite his increasingly weird behavior, and his inability to be a nurturing father to his sons. However, that did not preclude the older son from accompanying his father on trips in his adulthood, to keep him from being lured off by his illness to wander Europe, as he did earlier. <br/><br/>It is also an indication of how physiological his mental illness, how congenital, when we discover that his 2nd son is also a Math whiz and also schizophrenic. What is even more amazing to me, as a Math major, is the support he received from his fellow math students and teachers at MIT and Princeton, who..instead of viewing him as a rival and a weirdo....stood by him and gave him the support so many victims of mental illness fail to receive. For any of you who have friends or kin who suffer from some form of mental aberration, I strongly suggest this movie, both ""A Beautiful Mind"" and the documentary on the man himself, John Nash. <br/><br/>What is left out of the Hollywood movie, but included in the documentary gives us much insight into what movie producers think the public wants. Quite frankly, I believe ""a Beautiful Mind"" would have been much more nuanced and yes, enjoyable, had we been shown the whole story.<br/><br/>You will also find interesting the revelation you hear from him: ""I stopped taking the medicine, because it inhibited my work, and decided to refuse to listen to the voices, knowing how they were generated."" My son has ADHD and is now a computer professional with 3 beautiful children. He says, ""I wish you had not given me Ritalin, because I felt like I was 2 people in one body. If one of my children shows hyperactive tendencies, I will do ANYTHING before I try drugs."" Food for thought. Do we drug our children for THEIR sakes, or our own?"

Crowe shines in the lead role, carrying the film, however Akiva Goldsmans screenplay and Howards direction perfectly matched the film. A Beautiful mind is a classic example of great acting and an all-together great production. Harris, Connely and Plummer all gave great supporting peprformances however i thought Josh Lucas was also great in his role. The cast was very well selected and the cinematography was also notable. This film is perfect in all aspects and was very enjoyable. 10/10"

","A stellar performance from a stellar actor. Thought he was a flash in the pan with Gladiator eh? Me too. We were both wrong. He has proved one thing beyond doubt. He can do anything on film and it works. He indeed was robbed of his deserved Oscar and he indeed earned it in A Beautiful Mind. Superior direction from Howard combined with Russell's talent made it an Oscar favorite. The film does leave out several periods in his life story but I found that those additions only would have served to detract from the masterpiece instead of make it smoother or more ""factual"". This is a story about life, love, sickness, and genius. It is also a story of a triumph of the human spirit. The spirit urges us forward when the mind fails and the heart is not willing. It makes you feel things that most people can never hope to understand. Best film of 2001."
"jsataluri","9","1","3","5 September 2005"," sometimes confusing but very good
","What Ron Howard did to this movie is what no other director could. He portrays the story of man who is haunted by other dreams and people that don't exist, yet he still goes on and wins the Noble Peace Prize. The movie actually goes inside Nash's head and we can see how much suffering he is going through and how people don't understand him and the other way around. It was confusing at first, because I couldn't tell whether Ed Harris's character or the others were real or not and if the world that he was living in was a fake, just like the Truman show. However, it is a true story and the world that he lived in was real enough. Russell Crowe gives his best performance ever, even better than Gladiator. You can see his emotions and his fight to overcome those struggles. Ed Harris and everyone else do a great job with their roles. However, Jennifer Connelly stole the show with her performance as Alicia Nash. How she still cared and loved John really amazed me and she definitely deserved that Oscar. It is definitely one movie worth to be watching. 10 out of 10."

","The only thing ""genius"" about the movie is the opening piece of music. Unfortunately even it may get cut out when the movie is ripped/converted to DivX. The depiction of either ""the creative process"" or schizophrenia is very far from what they are in any reality that I am familiar with (I am not very well familiar with schizophrenia but I've seen crazy people and science is close to me). There is no drama in John Nash's disease. All of it seems like a normal life but with a few extra people appearing to the main hero that nobody else seem to notice. The depiction of drama that followed is very sketchy at best with several decades of his life compressed into just a few minutes. The movie seems to suggest that the Nobel Prize is a sufficient reward for all of Prof. Nash's suffering. I personally would not trade 30 or more years of my life for any prize."

One thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead they call the Nobel-price (named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel) 'the noble-price'.. Jesus!

Yes.<br/><br/>The problem is that the depiction is pure formula. Everything reeks phony. Phony, phony, phony! It makes shameless use of much too obvious Hollywood standard tricks to stir up emotions. The bicycling routine, the desk out the window, the stereotype mannerism, the ubiquitous self referencing (the board game, the pen gifts e.g.). And the international Hollywood symbol of ""crazy"" is walls plastered with papers and photos. Yawn!<br/><br/>The acting is downright hammy. It suffers from the Hollywood illness: heavy handed hammering the sentiments down our throats, no elegance at all. And the dumbest Hollywood standard of them all: let the actor speak out what has just been acted out! When even the dimmest of the viewers has seen ""they did it"" the actors MUST say ""WE DID IT"". Right, yes, why take the trouble of showing it on the screen when you tell us anyway? Does American directors think the viewers are too dumb to believe what they see? Are they planning the soundtrack for broadcast as a radio play on the side?<br/><br/>An English project would have created a much more subtle, intelligent movie which would have explored the story and impacted so much harder. I can't help compare with Shine. It's a totally different movie but the same story. It's done with elegance. I am quite unsentimental by nature but the tears forced their way out when I saw that. This didn't move me at all, I just started counting the clichés to have something to do while the utterly predictable moved along ...<br/><br/>This is a totally overrated film in my opinion. Oscar? More than one?? Best picture??? They must be joking!"

They tend to ""glamorize"" the romance, and overall, I was disappointed, as I had hoped this movie would portray a more accurate ""version"" of John Nash. James Horner (off comment here) is a good musician, but it seems his inspiration is ""borrowed"" from his idols. I wasted my money buying the soundtrack, as it is extremely redundant. Charlotte Church has a great voice, but Horner is a major disappointment in my opinion (for this movie) in that it seems he takes a 'theme' and not only plays it to death, but copies other composers that it is evident, inspire him. Not very original in my book! Definitely an ""overrated"" movie! Perhaps an 'okay' rental. Don't waste your money buying it!"

","Either Moulin Rouge! or Lord of the Rings would have been a better choice for Best Picture of 2001 (U.S. Academy Awards) than this. I went in with an open mind and came out with, shall we say, far less of an understanding of John Nash than I had hoped. Supporting actors are great, but Crowe's performance is too obvious and pales in comparison to his stellar nuanced work in The Insider. Connelly was actually a lead character and not supporting, but can one HONESTLY say that she added as much to this film as Maggie Smith added to Gosford Park? I truly believe that their acting would not have been NEARLY as acclaimed had they not aged on screen. <br/><br/>There were several emotionally manipulative scenes that reminded me of the same shameless ""pull at the heartstrings"" tactics of On Golden Pond. Suffice to say, this is only TWO ASPECTS of Nash's life, and the articles I read about Nash around the time of this film indicate they left A LOT out. I'd rather watch Philadelphia or Terms of Endearment than this any day. For an UN-glossed-over biopic, I recommend ""Hilary and Jackie"" about troubled MS-stricken cellist Jacqueline DuPre.<br/><br/>There are some effective plot devices and good acting, yes, but they don't make up for the drenching sentimentality that weighs this film down. Worth seeing, but Best Picture was definitely going too far."
"knotwilg","Null","1","3","19 January 2004"," Overall disappointment - with Spoilers
","My main complaint about this movie (and the book) is that it may reflect a strong fascination for mathematicians but doesn't pass the fascination for maths at all. I don't know if this would bother me as much if I weren't a mathematician myself, though. Be it as it may, I don't want a movie or book at all to be filled with formulae: after all, inventive maths is about ideas, and formulae are just tools. If you really want to read a thrilling drama about a man losing his mind to maths, then read of ""Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture"" by Apostolos Doxiadis. A wonderful and appealingly small novel and not a single formula in it. If you are more into maths, then you will already have read ""Fermat's Enigma : The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem"" by Simon Singh.<br/><br/>You may read Tedg's comment for an exhaustive review of the missed opportunities. While I initially watched with a lot of prejudice - I didn't even manage to finish the book - I started appreciating the movie a little bit because of the following things:<br/><br/><ul><li>All the appearances which I thought highly exaggerated and ""typical of American iconolatry"" turned out to be the product of his schizophrenia. The emblematic national security chief, the best friend and the little niece in wonderland, were actually very well chosen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The make-up on Crowe was rather astonishing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The idea that psychiatric patients are capable of humour and self sarcasm pleases me too, although I'm not sure whether it is actually true.</li></ul><br/><br/>However, the good points are outnumbered by the IMO inconsistent acting by Crowe, his unconvincing mannerisms and the flatness of all the characters, especially that of his caring wife. For just a few seconds there was a scent of foul play in the air, when his colleague starts caring about her which could be seen as courtship. Worst of all, after the highlight of the movie, Nash' admission to the psychiatry, the movie wanders about until the obligatory but unwarranted Nobel prize ceremony relieves us (me at least) from boredom."

It's funny, dramatic and touching but it never feels manipulative (well, maybe once near the end), letting the emotional effects come naturally from the actions (unlike other Ron Howard movies).

"ffordegroupie","Null","1","3","25 August 2002"," A beautiful mind hides an ugly soul
","There are some spoilers below, though not many, I think.<br/><br/>****<br/><br/>One can chalk up ""Beautiful Mind's"" award success to the Academy's desperation not to give ""Lord of the Rings"" the Oscars it so richly deserved. (Especially when one considers that ""Hurricane"" didn't get Oscars for similar omissions just a few years ago) I feel vaguely queasy when I read either comments on how well-researched this movie was, or how the complete lack of truth is outweighed by the mushy inspirational story. (Well, I don't find it inspirational because it hasn't got a shred of truth)<br/><br/>John Nash's character is carefully whitewashed of his more glaring flaws, the ones that might not have been relevent to his schizophrenia. In this movie, he is not a bisexual (and no amount of denial by him or Alicia will change what people think), he never tried to renounce American citizenship, he never had affairs, he made a Nobel prize speech gushing over his wife, he never made passes at men and got busted for it, he never abandoned a child, he and Alicia didn't have a rotten marriage that eventually broke up for years because of his schizophrenia (can't have a sad ending concerning the devoted little wifie), or any of the truly negative aspects of his persona. According to this movie, Nash was a good guy who was only mean because of his disease.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe gives his usual disjointedly stone-faced performance, with plenty of facial tics to convince us that Nash is schizophrenic; Jennifer Connelly is okay, but she is never given anything really award-worthy, and her character is too icky-sweet to be likeable. The supporting characters are pretty flat, though the actors are clearly doing all that they are capable of doing.<br/><br/>Does the sentimental ""inspiring"" love story override the blatant lack of facts? Nope. This is portrayed as a biopic, and as such you expect to hear about the life of the person involved. How much of Nash's life is in here? Not much! And how can a story, supposedly at least semi-true, be inspirational if it isn't true? Lurking behind the inspirational love story is the huge, hulking, ugly truth. I couldn't watch a single gooey scene without thinking, ""yeah, sure, like THAT happened!""<br/><br/>And frankly it is the sign of an undeserving director that Howard can't give us a view of Nash without erasing his flaws. A truly talented director would give us an unflinching portrait of Nash -- good and bad -- and attempt to get the audience to like and/or respect Nash (even grudgingly). But apparently that is beyond Howard's skill. Instead, he tries to manipulate us into liking Nash without his flaws rather than despite them. And it makes those flaws all the more glaring by doing so.<br/><br/>If this movie had been a fictional story about a fictional mathematician, it would have been a decent flick. But as they try to palm it off as an inspirational biopic, it falls into a beautiful mess. Rent the snubbed ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for a truly emotional, well-directed, excellently-acted movie that could even be called... dare I say ""Beautiful""?"
"RIK-22","4","1","3","18 July 2002"," Well acted, but poor story telling
","I watched the DVD, of A Beautiful Mind, over a week ago, as I had really made my mind up about the picture, I didn't write anything until now.  One thing I can't dismiss was the performances of Jennifer and Russell, whom I thought were both excellent.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about Ron Howard's direction, it's hard to criticise Ron, as he is such a likeable chap and on the DVD, you hear him talk about the film with great dedication and passion.  Having said all that I feel that this was a weak presentation of a story, rather like Apollo 13, simplistic, join the dots' film making.  No real use of the camera or changes of style. Nothing in this film draws me in or surprises me, by the end of the film, you have a feeling of being let down, with the director trying to get some kind of sentimentality out, even when there isn't any naturally there.<br/><br/>There are, of course, two fundamental problems with this film, the story itself.  A mathematician, a shy difficult genius, who suffers from Schizophrenia.  Yet he has the dedication of his wife to help him through his experiences.  The story isn't that interesting or at least it isn't presented as interesting.  The other greater problem is the lack of truth, which is a real problem for me.  The reason I see a true story' is because I really want to see the reality of the situation and what really happened, not a fictitious account.  When I read, after viewing the film, that he had homosexual affairs, whilst at school and in fact he believed he was hearing from Aliens and not from people, it adds a completely different slant on things.  Also the key point of the movie, in my opinion, was his wife's ability to stay with him.  In reality it was her that hid his problems and it was her that had him committed to an institution and the biggest contradiction was that she divorced him.<br/><br/>In summary, well acted, but yet another Hollywood true story' that is far from true (Hurricane, The Perfect Storm, Braveheart, etc)<br/><br/>6/10"

"ShawnLucas","6","1","3","7 March 2002"," An Over Rated Mind
","I watched A Beautiful Mind a few hours ago.  I hand it to Ron Howard and his producers for assembling a great cast.  But this movie is nothing new in many ways.  It is a wonderfully crafted love story, expertly technical but methodically predictable.<br/><br/>Some evidence that the film is derivative were the special effects used to reveal Nash's observations of pattern and code.  Numbers light up off of pages of text.  Similar effects were used in Jody Foster's movie Little Man Tate, at least ten years ago, when Foster's character's son ""sees"" mathematical equations in a highlighted neon light fashion.  It is helpful for the viewer to see what the character does in both films, though not new now.<br/><br/>Crew note: remove the marks for wide shots.  I saw a taped ""T"" on the floor in the Princeton tea room foyer.  Judd Hirsch as Einstein tells Nash that he won't receive the Wheeler recommendation, then the camera pulls out and Nash exits walking backward.  As the shot widens there you will see the taped ""T"" marks on the floor where Hirsch and Crowe were standing.<br/><br/>I grew up near West Virginia.  I've visited and stayed in West Virginia and had friends from West Virginia.  Crowe's West Virginia accent was not heavy enough to cover his Australian.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly looked fantastic and her acting was ineffectual.  Let me compare: Both women in Mulholland Drive showed much more depth and range than Connelly's Alicia Nash.  They did things, and caused things to happen. Alicia Nash does not cause anything to happen, and that may be a flaw of the screenplay.  I can read into it that Alicia helps John to understand love to be a real thing, as real as the universe is infinitely large.  But don't read to far.  A second thought though, the only thing that could stand up to Crowe's presence and stature, since he's won the Oscars and the Golden Globes, is Connelly's stunning beauty.  No current A list actress could act in such a simple fashion and be so captivating at the same time.<br/><br/>The script and some of the actions were predictable.  For example the over used ""throw the glass at the mirror,"" when Connelly used it to exhibit emotion after being rejected by an over medicated John in bed.  Take Harris's posturing in Nash's office as evidence of Greek Tragedy style acting.  Harris holds open his jacket by resting his hands on his hips, thereby exposing an ominous pistol in a shoulder holster.  It is a menacing stance, but it is almost a stereotypical threat by someone with a gun that we've seen many times before.<br/><br/>A Dr. Seus book is used as a prop, held by a young character.  Maybe Howard is reminding us that he directed that live action Seuss movie.  And more on the subject of Howard recycling from his past, a host of Howard's family worked on A Beautiful Mind, see film credits, as well as Harris appearing in Apollo 13 directed by Howard.<br/><br/>Thanks to James Horner's stirring cello music for pulling my heart strings, yes, I cried.  When you see that A Beautiful Mind is truly about love, like I did, you'll cry too.  Forgive me, I fall for the emotional manipulation tactics every time a cello plays!  I am a sucker for a good movie.  And though it may be nothing new, A Beautiful Mind is a very good movie."

The film lacks momentum and at times someone seems to have decided to simply kick the script in the butt to at least keep the film moving. As a spectator it is hard to know what was actually intended: a thriller, a biography, a feel-good movie or simply an attempt to make some profit in the wake of the ""Sixth Sense"".<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was over-acting grossly. Many a time a wry smile forces itself unto you seeing him clown his way through the darker parts of this drama. As usual, Jennifer Connelly gives a charming but rather bleak appearance. Under the circumstances the acting is more than adequate though, and provides one of the few memorable points of this movie.<br/><br/>The scenes depicting life at a university are so simplistic that you don't know if you should laugh at so much stupidity or be angry at the director for treating you like a dimwit. The more so as this is a story about a man with an exceptionally high I.Q..<br/><br/>I read somewhere that throughout the film one can see the microphones. I didn't actually notice this (understandably, as the movie does its best to mix romantic intermezzos with a contrived thriller plot). But this doesn't come as a surprise seeing that the most important parts of the movie have been unlovingly expedited.<br/><br/>Sadly, the most novel aspect of this story, i.e. the workings of a man's mind, and more specifically the victory of a man over his own mental illness, almost disappeared under the mass of cliche story elements and the artificial (and ultimately superfluous) plot twists à la Sixth Sense."

WHY does she stay with him?  She is a total MYSTERY...) and in the end, give him a huge award because he has finally stopped demanding to be considered ""important.""  Who the heck would watch that?

","This film gets tremendous amounts of credit for being very real, and for Russel Crowe's supposed brilliant performance as the lead. I say these people are missing a few things. First of all, Crowe's role may not have been easy, but he certainly isn't masterful at it and is often either over-the-top or just not entirely credible and never seems completely ""in"" the film like some actors can make you forget they are paid actors with lives outside a film. Another thing is the film is very much a plain account, a mere biography, of some brilliant mathematician who had to struggle with severe schizophrenia. Nothing earth-shaking and not much to work with besides retelling the story, this film deals a lot with just events rather than a cinematographic interpretation of those events, and the parts that are indeed rendered movie magic are over-celebrated, emotionally void and subtlety-deprived moments that engage the audience forcefully with overdramatic music and classic thick cinematic methods rather than through a strength built through heart and genuine emotion. This film painfully lacks heart and an authentic atmosphere. It is just a mechanically carried out drama affair that collects gratuitous amounts of credit, it doesn't deserve. Hollywood in the works, industrially produced, executed and sold. No art or personal touch found here."

They are simply flawless. Two that must not go unmentioned are Russell and Connelly, both of whom deliver a powerful and unforgettable portrayal of their respective roles. The characters are well-written and credible. This is impeccably well-written and psychologically accurate. The plot is interesting and develops marvelously throughout. I could not take my eyes off this for a single moment at any point. The pacing is spot-on.

If you are not certain what I am referring to after a viewing, feel free to contact me and I will tell you. The music is excellent and fitting. This has incredible production values, and deserves every award it won. There is some rather disturbing content, a little violence and occasional, moderately strong language.

","A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash (Crowe), a brilliant mathematician. It begins by showing his days as a student at Princeton, where he searches for a completely original idea, something that will earn him widespread recognition. This goes on for about the first 25 minutes, and it is positively brilliant. But then, something happens. The next 20 or so minutes are extremely predictable and dull, as if it came straight out of a spy novel. This is my fault, though, because I find out as little as possible about a movie before seeing it. Had I tried finding out a little more about A Beautiful Mind, I would've surely seen the reason for this. Long story short, I wasn't expecting the major plot twist that came around the hour mark of the film, and that just blew me away. That dull 20 minutes is something I appreciated only when viewing the segment again, this time with the knowledge of why it seemed so dull. <br/><br/>*** If you know positively nothing about ABM's plot, I strongly recommend skipping the following *** <br/><br/>The praise for A Beautiful Mind is completely justified. Russell Crowe was positively robbed of an Oscar, as his performance is completely and wholly captivating from beginning to end. It is essentially due to his fantastic acting that Ron Howard brilliantly portrays schizophrenia. Researching the film a little more, I found that the movie takes enormous liberties with the real-life events it is based on, and has been heavily criticized for it. I disagree with such criticism. There is no way for a director to capture on film the mind of a schizophrenic. Nash's delusions are altered from auditory, but these liberties serve only to make them more powerful, shocking, and disturbing on screen. This is what makes the film so darn good— it captures the absolute pandemonium of the life of a schizophrenic. I really couldn't care less if the exact delusions experienced are not shown, so long as the atmosphere of such delusions is portrayed. The horror of Nash's tumultuous life is brilliantly captured when he ""attacks"" his wife, thinking he is defending her from a gunman. <br/><br/>*** Safe to read from here on *** <br/><br/>The Verdict: A Beautiful Mind might not be faithful to the source material it is based on, but it transfers the atmosphere of the source material perfectly on screen. Russell Crowe's brilliant acting proves to be the film's foundations, along with Ron Howard's brilliant direction. (By the way, a special mention goes out to Vivien Cardone for a straightforward, yet bone-chilling, performance.) Truly a great movie, A Beautiful Mind is quite an achievement— undoubtedly the Best Picture of 2001.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10."

","It's a stunning tale of perseverance and quite possibly the finest character study of all time. The film does a great job of exploring every single aspect of John Nash's mind and when we finally see him for who he truly is, my heart breaks. A heartbreaking film that becomes almost unbearable to watch as Nash combats with his own mind between what he knows is right and what his mind tells him is real. The fact that he had such a beautiful gift for codebreaking but along with it came an unimaginable curse is terrifying. I believe it's impossible to understand what possibly could go through John Nash's head on a daily basis, and the experiences he had to endure throughout his life really are unimaginable but this film does a flawless job of bringing us as close to understanding him as possible. A big help in creating it's brilliance are the phenomenal performances from Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly which are two of the best of their career (probably is the best of Jennifer's), the decade and, I dare-say, of all time. A sensational work."

","You know, I haven't seen ""Gladiator"" yet, and I honestly don't know why. I have seen this movie as well as ""Cinderella Man"", and Russell Crow has this acting thing down. I'm a sucker for biopics as it is, but honestly Ron Howard did a great job directing and Russell Crow did an equally great job acting. The story was touching. John Nash (Russell Crow), ironically enough, was incredibly brilliant, but he also suffered from hallucinations. He was stuck in a difficult quandary: he could take his medication which would suppress his illness and effectively erase his identity, which was his brilliant mind. Or, he could refuse his medication and keep his superiorly sharp mind, but also risk his sanity. Just being afflicted with the illness and having to succumb to it would have been a story in itself, but Nash actually living with the illness without taking inhibitors made his story that much more spectacular. He made a daring bold move to deal with his condition without the aide of his medication so that he wouldn't be without what made him -him. In fact, he proved what a powerful mind he had to deal with the hallucinations and still continue to operate normally. This was truly a wonderful story about a beautiful mind."

She will be his support in the good and in the bad times. Together they will live in an alternate world of suffer and compassion; created of course by John's beautiful mind.<br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough. Since I watched it on theaters back in 2002 I knew this movie would change my life and it did. Sure, it has the typical Hollywood vibe but Ron Howard displayed a feeling of tenderness and passion like in no modern movie.<br/><br/>From beginning to half of the movie you wonder about John's mental health but then after it's revealed of his disease, you can't help but care about him and try to understand what's really going on with his mind and thoughts.<br/><br/>The acting is simply great, moving, tender, powerful. Russell Crowe demonstrates he's a solid dramatic actor and knows perfectly how to display many emotions. Jennifer Connelly shines with her powerful and passionate performance. This woman revolutionized acting in the new millennium. She can express MANY things and feelings with her beautiful green bright eyes... She also is simply beautiful, stunning.

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","4","22 September 2005"," Triumph of the Spirit
","Director Ron Howard has the reputation of making intellectually undemanding films, often with a sentimental, uplifting theme, and ""A Beautiful Mind"" is no exception. It is a biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash, but makes no attempt to explain Nash's mathematical theories, probably wisely as pure mathematics is a notoriously difficult subject for the layman to grasp. The film points out that these theories have influenced a number of fields of activity, including economics and evolutionary biology, but does not go into any detail about the nature of that influence. The film is rather an example of the ""triumph of the human spirit over adversity"" type of biopic, the adversity over which Nash triumphs being the schizophrenia from which he suffered.<br/><br/>When we first meet Nash he is an undergraduate at Princeton in the late 1940s, intellectually brilliant but awkward and lacking in social skills. Despite his gaucheness, however, Nash makes a close friend in his more self-assured room-mate Charles Herman, and later meets and marries a beautiful student named Alicia. After graduating, he is recruited by the American intelligence services to help break Soviet codes during the Cold War. His CIA contact, Parcher, informs him that the Soviets are using American newspapers and magazines to convey information to their agents, and much of Nash's time is taken up with his attempts to crack the code they are using. <br/><br/>It is at this point that Howard pulls off a coup de cinema. Sudden plot twists are more normally associated with the thriller genre, but Howard shows that they can be just as effective in the context of a biopic. We learn that Nash is not merely eccentric but actually mentally ill and that much of what we have hitherto seen- and accepted as fact- is not the truth, but an illusion existing only inside Nash's head. It turns out that there is no such person as Charles Herman; he is a figment of Nash's imagination. Although it appears that Nash did indeed do some work for the CIA, Parcher is also an imaginary figure and the supposed Soviet newspaper code which Nash has desperately been trying to crack has no existence in reality. There is a suggestion that Nash's fantasies are ways of compensating for his own perceived deficiencies; ""Charles"" is outgoing and confident whereas Nash himself is shy and reserved, and the melodramatic adventures in which he becomes embroiled with ""Parcher"" perhaps reflect an unfulfilled desire for physical excitement. The rest of the film details Nash's attempts, with the aid of his doctors and the loyal Alicia, to overcome his illness and to return to productive life as a mathematician. <br/><br/>Like a number of Howard's films, this one has been criticised for its alleged sentimentality. This criticism, however, does not seem to have done it any harm in the eyes of the Academy; indeed, sentimentality often seems to be a positive advantage when it comes to winning Academy Awards. There is some truth in the criticism, but at least ""A Beautiful Mind"" sins less grievously in this respect than does another recent ""Best Picture"" winner, ""Million Dollar Baby"". Like that film, however, it is saved by some excellent acting performances. I knew from ""Gladiator"" and ""Master and Commander"" that Russell Crowe was a gifted actor; ""A Beautiful Mind"" showed me that he is also a versatile one, able to play a character very different from the action heroes he played in those two films and to convey the pathos of Nash's situation as the possessor of a brilliant but flawed mind. He received good support from Jennifer Connelly as Alicia and also from Ed Harris as Parcher and Paul Bettany as Charles, these latter two actors coping well with the difficult task of portraying characters who are, even in the context of the story itself, fictitious, having no reality outside the mind of another character. <br/><br/>It has also been claimed that the film is not always accurate when it comes to the facts of Nash's life. It has, for example, been criticised for not mentioning allegations of affairs with both men and women, although I am not sure whether details of his supposed bisexuality were omitted at the behest of studio executives who felt that a main character who was anything other than a red-blooded heterosexual was bad for the box-office, or of gay activists who disliked any possible association between homosexuality and mental illness, or of Nash himself who has denied the allegations. It has also been pointed out that Nash's real-life relationship with Alicia was rather more rocky than the one shown here; they were actually divorced and remarried, something omitted from the film. No biography, however, can ever hope to tell the full story of its subject's life, and biographers always have to choose which elements they wish to emphasise. This choice is particularly acute for the scriptwriters and directors of filmed biographies, if only because a normal-length feature film can convey far less information than a book. Here Howard and Akiva Goldsman have clearly gone for the emotional rather than the factual approach to Nash's life; seen as entertainment rather than a biographical treatise this approach works well enough. 7/10"

","Prior to ""A Beautiful Mind"" coming out, I had never heard of John Nash. Then, this movie blew me away. While most critics panned it, the viewer gets completely absorbed by every performance. Russell Crowe does an excellent job as Nash, starting out with his days as a student at Princeton. As the movie progresses, we see his schizophrenia evolve. His wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) is virtually the only person who can understand him.<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those movies where you are surprised as you learn various things about the characters. Also, maybe the movie's timing might have helped it. After September 11, 2001, we needed something to show us that human nature is not inherently evil. This movie, released a few months later, did a great job reminding us of that. All in all, I consider it very appropriate that this movie finally got Ron Howard a Best Picture winner (plus a Best Director Oscar). Never preachy or sappy, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie, and Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly probably played their best roles ever."

","""A Beautiful Mind"" is typical Hollywoodized claptrap designed to jerk the heartstrings of the average viewer, with Russell Crowe overacting like a fool.  <br/><br/>Hopefully this film will drop out of the IMDB top 250 soon, as it's one of the more overrated films in movie history.  To be honest, I cannot imagine most of the ""real life"" occurrences actually happening anything like the way they did in the film.  Crowe is one of the most egotistical and psychologically messed-up actors around, and it's clear here that he thinks he's another Marlon Brando.  Hollywood has done little to disabuse him of this notion.  Who knows what further silliness and excesses we can expect from Mr. Crowe in the future?<br/><br/>The film isn't too bad if you ignore the blatantly manipulative elements. The story is engaging enough thanks to decent acting (particularly from Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer), and the film is watchable on a more ""mindless"" level -- it's fun to watch these top-list actors doing their stuff.  However, rest assured that this is not an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, or of the real-life John Nash's life.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is worth a watch if it comes on cable (currently playing on HBO), and you should make up your own mind.  From where I'm standing, it's pretty much one of those flicks designed to attract Academy voters at Oscar time and tug on the heart-strings of gullible viewers.

A Beautiful Mind cleans ups Nash's story, softening the edges and failing to provide any insight into the inner workings of this complex man. By the time we get to the third act things have degenerated into true Ron Howard hooey. The saving grace of this movie are the performances of Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. They share real chemistry, and make for convincing viewing. It is hard to believe that this is the same actor who was brandishing a sword and fighting tigers in Gladiator.

But it is just my wishful thinking and of course my views cannot and should not discount your decision in watching this well made film. Go see it and decide for yourself.<br/><br/>An actress of intelligence and intuition, Jennifer Conelly gave an equally outstanding turn as the strong and loving wife to Russell's madman persona. Without her able supporting performance and anchoring presence, the intensity of Russell's portrayal would not have soared the way it did.

"tfrizzell","Null","1","5","1 April 2002"," The Most Dominant Best Picture Winner in Years.
","""A Beautiful Mind"" is easily the finest best picture winner since ""Titanic"" and was a dominant movie during a year where several films could have been honored just as easily. John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe in an Oscar-nominated performance) comes to Princeton in 1947 determined to make a name for himself in the complicated science of mathematics. The young mathematician struggles though as his mind and body are consumed with theories and amazingly complicated formulas. The torture and hard work do pay off eventually as Nash comes up with a game theory which leads to bigger and better things. Fast-forward a few years and now Nash is continuing research at Princeton, teaching and falling in love with one of his students (Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly). All seems to be going well until he is approached one day by a mysterious government agent (Ed Harris in a cryptic performance). Now Nash is doing top-secret work as he becomes immersed in code-breaking to stem the tide of communism against the Russians. But ""A Beautiful Mind"" goes much, much, much deeper than that. The film takes a dramatic turn during its mid-point and the subject turns 180 degrees as Nash is diagnosed with schizophrenia which causes paranoia and skewers what is reality and what is reality to John Nash. What then follows is a story about mental illness and the complications which accompany that sickness to those affected and those who care for those who are affected. John Nash becomes a could-have-been mathematician then as he is placed in a mental health institution in the 1950s where he must go through intense insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and then must take medications to fight his illness. The medications destroy Nash's ability to think properly and affects his physical demeanor as well. Nash then takes it upon himself to stop the medications and try to use his mind to cope with his illness. While Nash does somewhat succeed in that regard, it is his beautiful heart and the love and support of those closest to him that enable Nash to continue his work and eventually receive the Nobel Prize for his Game Theory in 1994. Of course all of this is based on a true story and the real John Nash still teaches today at Princeton. The film is a Hollywood project though as it has become apparent that the film-makers took many liberties to tell this important story. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is director Ron Howard's (Oscar-winning) masterpiece by a mile. Very few could have directed this film with the style and dignity that Howard displayed. This movie was all shot in chronological order, a rare feat by any director. The Oscar-winning screenplay by Akiva Goldsmith proved to be the really important thing that made the film work as well as it did. This is the best film hands down dealing with the subject of mental illness (I do not consider ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" a film about this topic because I question whether or not Jack Nicholson's character really had anything wrong with him mentally). However, I must warn all that the scene leading up to Nash's insulin-injected electro-shock therapy and the treatment itself are disturbing sequences that are difficult to get through. The film achieved a PG-13 rating, but those scenes could have warranted an R just as easily. All the aforementioned performances are super and Judd Hirsch and Christoper Plummer (who has an imperative role that basically explains all that happens) both give excellent supporting turns, but this is Crowe's show as he gives his greatest performance to date. Excellent film from an excellent cinematic year. 5 stars out of 5."

It was NOT intended to be a complete biographical sketch. Plus, since much of Nash's work with the government was top-secret, all that had to be fabricated for the film. As were many of the characters, the delusions, the code-breaking simulations, the speech upon receiving the award. They sought to take a very captivation story of a genius who overcame a debilitating illness, with the help of a special companion, to survive and win a most high honor, and they have done it very well. It deserves ""Best Picture"" and Opie (I mean, Ron Howard) deserves ""Best Director."" <br/><br/>Second, I want to comment about the acting. Russell Crowe, as difficult as he may be at times in public, is THE consummate actor working today. Just to see what he does with this role of John Nash, to see how he captures the character, how he evolves as the film unfolds, is worth a viewing all on its own. Without getting into the politics of The Academy, nor criticizing anyone else's performance, Russell Crow deserves ""Best Actor"" for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind."" As well as he is regarded, I still think his work is under-appreciated by most. I found myself forgetting that I was seeing an actor, that's how good he is, and that seldom happens with me. All the others are good in this film, but Crowe is the sole reason for its greatness.<br/><br/>And third, anyone still watching movies like this at home on VHS are missing so much. This DVD, two disks actually, is one of the very best I have seen. Not only are the sound and picture just perfect, disk one allows you to play the film with either the director's or the writer's commentary. Both are among the most interesting of any commentaries, adding real value to understanding some of the finer points of the film. After I saw the whole film, I went back and re-played certain scenes with each commentary turned on, and essentially doubled my enjoyment of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Disk one also has some production notes and deleted scenes which are interesting. But disk two has a wealth of extras for those who like to study the whole creative process of movie-making. Included are the choice of the writer, a taped interview with John Nash where he tries to explain his prize-winning theory to Ron Howard. Scoring, special effects, etc, the whole process. I own the DVD."

","A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) *** Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer, Josh Lucas, Vivien Cardone, Austin Pendleton.  True-life account of brilliant mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr. (an excellently modulated Crowe) whose genius for numbers is only matched by his bout with schizophrenia throughout his struggle to make a name for himself in his field and control the demons within.  Connelly as his wife/partner for the long run Alicia is equally at her career best with her surprising choices along the way in the time-taking yet thoroughly compelling screenplay by Akiva Goldsman's adaptation of Sylvia Nasar's book.  Director Ron Howard's most mature work to date with minimal histrionics."
"jboothmillard","6","1","12","20 June 2006"," A Beautiful Mind
","First time I saw the film I thought it was brilliant, seeing it a second time I can understand reasons the critics give it three stars, but it is still very enjoyable, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ron Howard (Splash, The Da Vinci Code). Basically John Nash (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Russell Crowe, he lost to Denzel Washington in Training Day) is a maths genius at Prinecton University who can solve complicated equations, codes and theories. He can't find good use for his skills, so he becomes a teacher, and he falls for one of his students, Alicia Nash (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jennifer Connelly), who he also marries and has a child with. He is met by William Parcher (Ed Harris) who gets him working for the government breaking Soviet codes and getting involved in a big conspiracy plot. Alicia becomes concerned for John though and calls Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) to have a talk with him, and that is when we the audience, and soon John himself, realises he has paranoid schizophrenia. So John knows that Parcher, his university roommate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and his niece are all unreal people who only he can see, and he really struggles to get on with them in his life, causing terrible distress for Alicia. As the years go by he has learnt to ignore them, he returns to Princeton, and his academic success wins him the Nobel Prize for economics. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Sol, Judd Hirsch as Helinger, Josh Lucas as Hansen, Anthony Rapp as Bender and Austin Pendleton as Thomas King. Crowe does very well as the lead character, Connelly of course steals the show with her award-winning performance, and the support of Harris and Bettany are good, it is a film that desires people to take it seriously, but still very worthwhile. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for James Horner, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the David Lean Award for Direction for Ron Howard, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Russell Crowe was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Paul Bettany was number 40 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Good!"

","A Beautiful Mind is in fact a beautiful film. This film didn't just tell the story word for word for an audience to just to see what happened in Nash's life, director Ron Howard highlights his self-discovery experience especially and uses it as an educational tool for people to learn from, which is very important for people to understand how hard it is to acknowledge something harrowing like schizophrenia. The film makes you tag on to John Nash's life and you don't formally know he has schizophrenia until he finds out himself, at first you doubt it as much as he did, but it's what you're suppose to think. The film teaches you to empathise with not just schizophrenics but for all people who suffer different strains of mental illness.<br/><br/>Howard converts psychological experiences onto screen in ways for the audience to experience Nash's episodes of delusions and hallucinations. This is a very substansial way of empathising for him and prove that something like schizophrenia is not easy to get over.<br/><br/>Ron Howard further presents another theme which is the power of love. John Nash's life was going downhill but thanks to the help of his wife he manages to get through it. This shows that love is an excellent source of motivation for which you can learn from.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is an educational masterpiece"

","The story of professor John Nash is incredible and the movie was just very good in portraying his tragedy and what he had been through was only his beautiful mind that is facing the impossible and was good in expressing his wife's struggle , love and patience with him and both was performed incredibly well by Russel and Jennifer , both deserved the Oscar not only Jennifer. However Ron Howard did a good job in the movie but I think he didn't really deserve his Oscar cause the movie really could have been a lot better with lots of tears and of course a lot of other meanings from that genius person's story and only depending on the warm music and performance of the leading actors wasn't close to what this story could have become with another more intelligent director. By this I don't mean to Underestimate his good job in the movie but I guess many other awards agree with me that he did a good job but didn't do his best only the Oscars that refused to give it to Peter Jackson. The story too didn't focus on his smart and the people around him more than it focused on his problem and tragedy that I felt he was a genius person his tragedy prevented him from using his mind and his family suffered to make him better. The whole cast was superb and the music was the feeling of the movie very warming and passionate. Don't miss it. 7.5"

","For those who don't know, the poor rating will not make sense. For those who've heard but think its no big deal, I disagree with you. For those who know and care, please help stand up with me.<br/><br/>It is fact, not speculation, that John Nash was at very least bisexual, and the tendency to suppress this fact only adds to the stigma of shame thrust upon those of us who are not happily heterosexual. The people who write the scripts insist on changing facts to make the movie more mainstream and profitable, to make it more palatable for those whom share distaste for people who don't fit into how their egos require.<br/><br/> It is a shame, because this movie could have been groundbreaking beyond its intriguing portrayal of a brilliant man's inner turmoil, done so well otherwise. You cannot use an excuse that revealing a complex man's complex natures would only give the story too much distraction.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed the movie otherwise but found the omission disgusting. Much like 'The Martian Child' by David Gerrald that was successfully translated to bigscreen, but because it would be 'unacceptable' to have characters 'marred' by so-called character-defects that would reduce their likability, well we certainly can't allow children to have such role models, can we?<br/><br/>I am fortunate to be well-educated and well-read, to have known that gay or bisexual men can be awesome and powerful, not just amusing.

","After seeing this film multiple times, it took me years to buckle down and read the book. It was is I was reading a different story. The film ""A Beautiful Mind"" starring Russel Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris was a gripping real life story of Nobel Prize awarded mathematician John Nash and his out of the box way of solving problems and learning the greatest lesson of life. Director Ron Howard did an excellent job of selecting the right team to bring the story from book to screen in a way that would keep viewers inspired, intrigued and with the ending wanting to learn more about the real life of John Nash. Watching this film one time is not enough as there are many scenes and sequences packed with the building blocks that tell viewers how John Nash played by Russell Crowe how he went from an being normal to discovering his unique abilities. What's also inspiring John Nash's wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and her undying dedication and loyalty through John's severe struggle of separating the real world from fantasy. William Parcher played by Ed Harris is a fooler in this film as we think he's one thing, but turns out to be another. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those films that you will never get bored of watching as it's not only inspiring, but you may catch a detail that you didn't pick up the last time around. As mentioned before, watching the film and referencing the book was shocking as so many details were left out that it seemed I was reading a different story and John Nash was more complex than the movie portrayed, in which the film character was a very complicated person. What both the book and the film did accomplish in sync was telling a story of a genius who wanted to discover the complex answers and found the simple solution. A definite must own movie."

He was the kind of person who dedicates his time to mathematics rather than interacting with his fellow student. He was under pressure to find an ""Original idea"" for his thesis. He got the idea when he and his co-students were discussing on various ways to approach a group of girls. At first the movie seems to be one having more technical things than a story. When half of the movie gets over, Nash's life suddenly took a turn for the worse. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The rest of the movie shows Nash's transformation from a person struggling with schizophrenia who is not able to identify what is true to one of the most significant contributor in Economics.

He contracts a mental illness that has a tragic affect on his career, marriage and sanity. He is seeing images of people that are not really there there but he struggles in differentiating what is real and what is fantasy. Directed by Ron Howard with an intriguing visual style.

Christopher Plummer plays a doctor whom Nash believes is heading agents whom are after him but he believes that Nash needs medication.

"nmholland","9","0","1","20 February 2016"," Ron Howard's Best Film Since Apollo 13
","A Beautiful Mind is directed by Ron Howard and star Russell Crowe as John Nash, a brilliant man that attended Princeton during the late 1940's and early 1950's. He is eventually recruited, in secret, by the government, to break codes involving an atomic bomb hidden somewhere in Europe. Soon after, things take a psychological twist, leaving John to wonder what's real, and what's not. Now, I can't talk about this movie too much in depth, because there's a plot twist about halfway through that I don't want to spoil, but I'll still review it.<br/><br/>To start with some pros, this movie is amazingly directed, much like Ron Howard's other films. It also looks great, with an ever changing cinematography based on the decade the setting is currently in. The movie is mostly set in the 50's, but it also shows some time in the 40's, 70's, and 90's as well, and all these time periods are very distinguishable from one another, thanks to the cinematography and directing.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is amazing. Russell Crowe as John Nash is a perfect casting choice. Crowe does great as a man in Nash's situation, and really fits in the role. Paul Bettany also does very good. Bettany plays Charles, John's college roommate that quickly becomes his lifelong friend. This character was a perfect comic relief for the dark tone of the film. Jennifer Connelly as Alicea, John's wife, is great too. All of the acting is really great, and holds this movie up.<br/><br/>The last great thing I'll talk about is the score. James Horner makes yet another amazing score that pulls you inside of John's head every time it plays. It really helps the audience see through his eyes, and understand the way he feels about certain subjects.<br/><br/>Now, the only negative I had with film is the plot progression. Some people can see this film as very boring for the first act, yet also unpredictable. I thought the movie was going to go one way, until it took a 360 about halfway through and really threw me off. I actually had to sit and process it a little before continuing on with the film. This a good thing, once the credits role, but for the first portion of the movie, and when the twist occurs, it makes you wondering whether or not the film should've played out this way.<br/><br/>Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a great film, and a must see for most people. Ron Howard does amazing again, especially with Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, and James Horner working with him to create his best film since Apollo 13.

","I enjoyed it immensely and felt like I had seen a movie when it was over. I was shown a person at their best and the worse and everything in between, by a masterful actor at the top of his game. Just as good but with less screen time is the beautiful and beautifully talent Jennifer Connelly, who the world may finally get to see in a mainstream movie. Her chemistry with Crowe is vital to the movie and neither of them disappoint the audience at all in that respect. Russell Crowe does not overdo it for a minute and turns in his customary brilliant performance. Would not surprise me at all if he were to win his second Best Actor Oscar in March 2002. He really is that good."

","I wasn't actually planning on going to see ""A Beautiful Mind"" in the first place, but as it was, I was convinced by the friend that accompanied me that it was truly something to see. And now, after seeing it, I thank her for that. Instead of spending two and a half hours watching George Clooney and Matt Damon rob casinos or Kevin Spacey and Julianne Moore dealing with their problems in New Foundland, I found myself pulled into another kind of story, a powerful, emotional story of how one man learned to battle his own demons and dazzle the world.<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the novel by Sylvia Nasar, is the story of John Forbes Nash Jr., the genius mathematician, whose life suddenly takes a turn for the worse when he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After fierce battles with his inner self, he overcomes this and returns to win the Nobel Prize in 1994 for his brakethrough game theory in economics that he had been working on during his years in Princeton University in the 1950s.<br/><br/>John Nash, portrayed very well by the versatile and brilliant Russell Crowe, is a partly shy, yet ironic and sometimes even arrogant, gifted young student studying in Princeton University in the late 1940s. He dedicates his time to numbers and equations, set on to solving every problem at hand, rather than mingling with co-students on the football field or in the pub.<br/><br/>Nash is later on introduced to Sylvia (played by the lovely Jennifer Connely), a physics student attending his classes. She helps Nash to open up and eventually discover love.<br/><br/>Enter William Parcher (played by Ed Harris), a shadowy and mysterious agent working for the Department of Defense. Parcher, after realizing Nash's ability to see mathematical and geometrical patterns everywhere, approaches Nash with a mission that involves national security.<br/><br/>Now, amidst his work and relationship, Nash is suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of emotions and disbeliefs as he is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. And this is the part where ""A Beautiful Mind"" truly shines: in portraying the disorder from Nash's own point of view. In a powerful and emotional way, it shows the viewer how difficult an illness like this can be to not only face, but overcome, something that people today may not always realize.<br/><br/>Before seeing this movie, I must admit that I was a bit afraid that casting such a well-known actor as Russell Crowe as the main character would ruin the image of John Nash, forcing the viewer to see Crowe, rather than Nash. This is a common problem when dealing with famous actors, but to my surprise, it didn't much bother me much. And the same goes for Ed Harris.<br/><br/>As a movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is absolutely great (It is so much more, but I cannot find the words to praise it enough, so I will simply go with ""great"" =). Not only does it have a strong point and an importaint message to the viewer, but it delivers it in a touching and sensitive, partly even humorous kind of way, with the help of powerful actors, a great screenplay and even a few special effects to boost it up. So for anyone whose grown tired of the consant pointless action- movies out there, and"
"donnybee-339-394306","10","0","1","4 May 2015"," Amazing!
","I thought this film was absolutely brilliant, with all the actors fitting their roles perfectly. Crowe is phenomenal, you really see how hard it hurts him to find out although his mind is his best asset it is also his worst enemy. Seeing the struggle as he tries to fight it even though it's so hard is heartbreaking, and you see it's killing him to not be able to work as he wants to be recognised and have his own accomplishments. Supporting actors help pull the whole story together, Jennifer Connelly in particular I thought this was one of the best roles I've seen her in, she seems to embody the way the characters wife would feel if it was to happen to her, going through all these different emotions yet still wanting to stick by her husband through it all as it isn't his fault. Ed Harris is also a great supporting actor in this film, fitting the profile so well that you actually find it hard to believe it's all in Crowe's characters head. Many of the cast could have a mention. <br/><br/>I have only seen this film a few times yet every time it still amazes me and gives me goosebumps, an amazing movie, heavily recommended by me!"

Another time he made a sport ""Rush"". Far before them, he made sci-fi ""Apollo 13"". Wow that was bunch wide genres.<br/><br/>This movie has been weaken by the director himself in some way.

It's alright, we definitely can't judge a movie from the inaccuracy of it's plot. But they change it into something uninspiring, a little bit melodramatic, and untemperament. That was really not good for this kind of genre (drama biography based on true story). It's not match at all, it's blunt.<br/><br/>Although Ed Harris and Crowe's performances were good (not superb). And also the cinematography. That's all that rise this movie rating into 70+. My recommendation is, just try to enjoy this movie. For a movie-goers I'm sure it will work."

But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery once he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

"GTeixeira","7","0","3","6 August 2014"," A good film, but a terrible biopic
","Simply put, a biopic about John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematical genius who went on to win a Nobel Prize after years battling his many problems, including his schizophrenia.<br/><br/>'A Beautiful Mind' is good, that much I'm not questioning. It is very engrossing, at times moving more like a thriller than a drama; likewise, the emotion actually feels natural and effective, without the usual sappiness of Hollywood dramas. The acting is superb: Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly shine here, and deserved the awards that year. Others who shone in a very good cast included Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Paul Bettany.<br/><br/>My complaint comes in that this is supposed to be a biography of John Nash; however, it is anything but. This is Hollywood sugar-coating at its finest: it shows Nash as a troubled individual, having to fight against his illness and overcome his own shy nature to succeed; it completes ignores his more thornier history and changes it all to make him an impossibly sympathetic person. <br/><br/>They flat out make things up as they go for the sake of turning this into your typical 'underdog fighting against all odds', formulaic and not unlike 'Rocky' or 'Good Will Hunting' (those other two, though, do not attempt to disguise themselves under the cover of a true story).<br/><br/>This is partially fault of Nash himself, who refused to let a biopic of him unless they took out all the 'shadier' aspects of his life, and partially of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, who extensively makes use of emotion over actual storytelling to win over his audiences in pretty much every film he does (I know what to expect when I see his name on a film, and it is never to expect a great one).<br/><br/>In the end 'A Beautiful Mind' is a very good film, with a great cast, and a rare one which manages to make its emotional moments effective without melodrama or cheesiness; even the more cheesy moments, like Nash's 'Nobel Prize speech' (yet another non-truth), work better here than they usually. On the other hand, being labeled as a 'true story' or as a biopic is not only misleading, but distracting for those who know Nash's real (and far more interesting) story.<br/><br/>I never understood Hollywood when it comes to their sugarcoated biopics. If they are going to change and make things up so his lifestory can support the theme they want to, why still insist with the 'true story' label? Just to fool the viewers/critics?"

But...<br/><br/>...buried in the arguably over-slick and buttons-pushing production is a profound metaphor, and as the storyline ramps up, the message is unmistakable. It has to do with the flimsiness of the dividing line between public and private psychoses. It's an important and ever-relevant idea, and its nice that it occurred to someone that a major motion picture might be a good venue for broaching it.<br/><br/>I can think of two applications of this principle: Evangelical Christian environments, and--as directly addressed in this flick--""cold war"" (now ""terrorist"") paranoia.<br/><br/>The Andrea Yates story, where a woman drowned her 5 kids rather than suffer the torture of ""knowing"" that she'd screw them up and condemn them to perdition, is NOT a story about how religion drove a woman crazy. But the truth is, in a way, worse: It's a story about the blurring of the line between public and private psychoses; about how her church milieu willingly *masked* her break with reality. Yates's insanity reflects back on a social phenomenon that doesn't have the wherewithal to deal with the very thing it for which it vaunts itself to be equipped: After all, Christianity has its origins in the story of a man who, among other things, dealt effectively with mentally ill people. But all that's just a dim ancient myth as large swaths of contemporary Christian church culture now plow along, blithely aiding and abetting mental illness.<br/><br/>And the story of A Beautiful Mind deals roughly the same blow to the mass psychosis of paranoia about the ""other"", the nemesis, the enemy, somewhere out there, lurking, waiting to pounce, elsewhere in the world.<br/><br/>The sad part of these systems is how a negative, aberrant minority uses these institutions, and exploits the permeability between the social/private minds, to produce societal effects that are as apparently tangible and eminently true as they are palpably life-disaffirming.<br/><br/>I think the above interpretation summarizes the particular limb that Opie crawled out on, at great expense, to cinematically showcase.<br/><br/>And, to reiterate my opening thought; yes, A Beautiful Mind is a kind of The Sound of Music with mathematics; with all the negative critique implications implied. But the work is crowned with the redeeming trait of its having shed light on perhaps the most important challenge facing decent society."

","Ron Howard's A Beautiful mind is a film done with skill and excellence, with Russell Crowe giving his best performance since Gladiator but this time playing a controversial person instead of a Roman general. The man who Crowe plays is Professor John Nash a mathematician whose cryptology problems have dealt with economics and other things, but there is one thing that makes us feel bad for Nash and that is that he suffers from a disorder called schizophrenia a disorder where you see things that aren't visible but seen in his imagination. Howard uses an excellent cast Besides Crowe (in a performance that should've won an Oscar) but the film also has Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas, but it is Harris and Bettany who play as his delusions. This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance. This is in some people's lists as one of the worst best picture winners of all time and that the first Lord of the Rings movie should have won, but from my perspective there was something behind it that I think that it should have won best picture and that is that how powerful it was. There was other things that were good about the film besides the direction by Ron Howard, and the excellent performances, but the other things were, the magnificent cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, the score by James Horner, and last but not least the makeup and costumes. But before I saw it I truly underestimated this movie claiming that Ridley Scott should have won best director for his film that came out around the same time Black Hawk Down but I really think that they should have tied but with this one taking home the award for best picture."

","""A beautiful mind"" couldn't been better film then it already is, I can't say nothing bad about the movie. In short, the movie is about dealing with mental illness with emotion. The Plot of the movie is very interesting, touching. Great as a Biographic film, Great as a Thriler film, and also as a Romance film. A beautiful mind is very different than most of the films in the genre- psychological thriller (for example - ""The silence of the lambs"" , ""Black Swan"") mainly because of the use of emotional to solve the mental problem and find a solution for the illness. The Direction in the movie is extremely professional, Ron Howard definitely made his best work in the film, he pays attention to the small details. The screenplay is even better than the direction, clever and very original. The Acting in the movie is absolutely great! Russel Crow in the performance of his life time, In the Academy Awards history, in my opinion, the biggest mistake was giving Danzel Washington Oscar instead for Russel Crowe who gives an amazing performance as John Nash. Jennifer Connelly also very good, her best performance ever."

"therealadrian","5","0","1","25 February 2014"," Gripping but totally unrealistic and inaccurate
","I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. <br/><br/>At first glance, it is a boring movie. But as it continues on, he has a way of speaking and doing things that is very unusual and quite enticing. <br/><br/>As the movie goes on, it becomes increasingly interesting, as characters are developed in a lovely and elegant way, and, as someone who had deliberately avoided this movie for the past 13 years, I found myself quite intrigued as to the point of the movie.<br/><br/>First off, his behaviour seemed to me to be like that of a typical autistic, and I wondered if that was what his secret was. And when he was accosted and put into the mental hospital, I thought that he was a misunderstood autistic. And yet, apparently, this was all a secret as he was actually schizophrenic. Hrm. Nup. I don't think so.<br/><br/>The problem I found, and this was a big problem, was when we discovered what his delusions were.<br/><br/>The roommate, fair enough. You could believe that. Much like the imaginary friend out of Fight Club, but it was really him. And his niece too, fair enough. Believable delusions. An intelligent man could fall for that. Only problem is that neither of them ever age. But that can be argued around.<br/><br/>The problem came with the Department of Defence delusion.<br/><br/>Now, fair enough, he could be called to work for the Pentagon. That kind of thing happens, and they often call members of the public to help them out. We all know that that happens, and a mathematician being called in to do code breaking is not out of the question.<br/><br/>Being asked to decipher newspaper codes is fair enough too. It is well documented that spy agencies use newspapers to send encrypted messages. But they use advertising - not articles. The complexity of getting a journalist involved is virtually unheard of in the intelligence community. But the idea of entire newspapers across 20 or 30 publications all publishing fake parts of articles to send encoded messages is a level of complexity that just simply wouldn't happen. One corrupt journalist maybe. But not that many. It just isn't logical.<br/><br/>If he was just looking at advertising, fair enough. From what I have read, they usually use ""lost in love"" adverts to send messages. It was even shown on ""Mission Impossible"". It is easy as pie to put advertising like that in, you can do it anonymously and nobody checks what you put in. You could also put in fake used car ads and other kinds of advertising. But not articles. <br/><br/>Not only was he looking in the wrong area, but the level of what he was looking at was all wrong too. In ""Mission Impossible"" they used newspapers to say that they were safe and in the prescribed safe house. In ""Kick Ass"" they used a website to say that they needed help. That is the kind of thing that thy are going to put in - not talking about where to bomb. Things of that level of security would be done behind closed doors face to face. It just isn't believable.<br/><br/>And John Nash was a smart man so why didn't he work that out? That delusion was unbelievable. And I can't believe that he would fall for it. If it was to try to find bombers when they got out, fair enough. Trying to find bombers when they got out, using advertisements, fair enough. But just the level, well, surely he knew enough about the secret service to know that that just isn't believable.<br/><br/>And the thing is that once he was shown evidence he should have been convinced - yet he still fell for it again. Smart enough fellow but he fell for it in spite of evidence. The evidence couldn't have been planted. <br/><br/>The other thing is that the Department of Defence delusion was not a happy one. It was an upsetting delusion. When he discovered that his friendly roommate was a delusion, it would have upset him as that happiness would not be there. But on discovering that the horrible Department of Defence guy was fake he should have been happy. But he was not. Not happy because he is not as important? But he should have at least been happy that his life was not in danger.<br/><br/>The only positive part was that he had managed to treat his illness without medication or help from anyone else. We know that this is possible with regular physical illnesses like the flu, and it is very encouraging to think that he could have done that.<br/><br/>Only problem is that it isn't true. In spite of refusing medication, he still went back to hospital several times since he began trying to treat his mental illness without medication. <br/><br/>Not a good movie, and I feel a bit sad for people that fell for this. Gripping and all but so unrealistic and just not true to his life."

","Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, A Beautiful Mind is an expertly crafted biopic based on the life of schizophrenic mathematician John Nash & covers his struggle with his condition. Although the artistic license taken here makes it far more cinematic than required, the film nonetheless succeeds as a touching, entertaining & satisfying experience.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, the story of A Beautiful Mind begins in 1947 when the young John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Eccentric but brilliant, Nash graduates with flying colours, is hired by MIT but begins exhibiting troubling symptoms of a mental illness which in the long run affects not only his personal & professional life but also those around him.<br/><br/>Directed by Ron Howard, A Beautiful Mind does many things right but purely as a biopic, it leaves out or alters the facts way too much for dramatic purposes. Also, Howard has always preferred to play the safe game, avoiding any bold risks & this film is no different. The technical aspects are finely carried out but where the film makes its biggest impression is in its performances.<br/><br/>Featuring a reliable cast in Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Martin Hansen & others, A Beautiful Mind is bolstered by strong & sincere emotional performances from its cast with Crowe & Connelly impressing the most in their respective roles of John Nash & his wife Alicia. Also adding more strength in little doses is its warm cinematography, steady pacing & James Horner's elegant score.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, A Beautiful Mind is a surprisingly moving cinema which despite being a bit manipulative remains highly entertaining & gripping from start to finish. Although the authenticity of its take on Nash's life & mental illness can be argued, its 135 minutes of story feels quite satisfying in the end. Definitely one of the best films of its year & certainly the one in the career of Crowe, Connelly & Howard."
"cleary-joshua","10","0","1","27 August 2013"," This is proof of just how good Ron Howard is as a director...
","What criteria should we judge a biopic on? How true to life it is, or how well it works as a standalone movie? I ask because if ""A Beautiful Mind"" is judged by the first criterion, it fails pretty badly on many counts. We are provided with a watered down, glammed-up version of the life of John Nash, cutting out many of the 'gory details'. If we take the second criterion, it's a masterpiece, proof (as if we needed it) of how good Ron Howard is as a director, and how well Russell Crowe can act.<br/><br/>The movie tells the life story of economist John Nash, whom we first meet when he starts at Princeton. He is socially awkward, bullied in part by his fellow students, and spends all of his time trying to come up with some original work. The only person he seems to get on with is his roommate, played by Paul Bettany, and the two characters spend a lot of great scenes with each other. After Princeton, he works for the US government as a codebreaker and at MIT. He meets Alicia, who goes on to become his wife, but is becoming too infatuated with his 'government work', with Ed Harris' character constantly on his case.<br/><br/>I only summarise the plot in this much detail because there is a point, around the hour mark, where we discover that a large portion of it isn't real. John is really a paranoid schizophrenic, and a few of the characters are mere figments of his imagination. I went into the film knowing this in part, and guessed fairly early on that one of the characters wasn't real using 'Sixth Sense' logic (doesn't actually interact with anyone except the delusional character). The other main one completely astounded me. This is even more of a credit to Howard, since he makes the aftermath of the reveal even more interesting and shocking than the reveal itself. One of the great parts of having a fairly early twist is that the rest of the film is very unexpected, and keeps taking you to surprising places. I won't say much more, because going into this film without many spoilers makes it even better.<br/><br/>Watching the film, I wondered why Russell Crowe hasn't performed this well in any film recently. He is at the top of his game playing Nash, with fantastic awkwardness, an extremely believable accent, and character traits which seem very well studied. At first glance, he seems to be playing an intelligent Rain Man/Forrest Gump, but there's so much more depth to his performance. The film is a treat to watch, with an astounding cast all round and proof that one day Ron Howard will go down as one of the greatest directors of the 21st century."

","A Beautiful Mind is for me was predictable. Half way though the movie I stopped and thought that I can't watch the rest because I know what is going to happen. This film did not connect with me because of how predictable it is. The part about this film that I enjoyed is the way maths is expressed in the film though technologies and special effects. This brought to the film something magical. This could either be bad or good. It can make this film less believable but then again we as humans love something magical and untrue to our everyday existence. When watching this film you see the underlying message of how our world is in need of a hero, that can test the great achievers before him and save the world from war. This film also rings truth to the fact the no one can be perfect and you will be banished from society if you are."

","A Beautiful Mind is consistently engrossing as an unusual character study and as a trip to the mysterious border-crossing between rarified brilliance and madness. It's a Hollywood biopic of maths genius John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe), whose brilliant career was blighted by schizophrenia and paranoid delusions.<br/><br/>The film ascribes a great deal less intelligence to its audience than it does to its subject, approaching his life through a prism of dubious narrative gimmickry and with much overrated acting. A feeling of Oscar-grab mendacity is hard to shake off. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life."

","I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but this movie just took me by storm. Its uniqueness, ironically enough because it was based on a real life situation was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood blockbuster. This movie provided a brilliant (pardon the pun) insight into many aspects of a genius at work.<br/><br/>This movie touched me on many levels. The psychology of the movie was intriguing, the mathematical philosophies was actually realistic from my own experience, and the icing on the cake making the movie stand out was surprisingly the humanistic side of Love. While love is a common basis in most movies, the interaction of this theme with other aspects of the plot was planned phenomenlly.<br/><br/>As for the cast, I have never noticed the actual difference in skill between many actors/actresses before. I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definitely the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade. Perhaps politics played a bigger part than I previously would have thought."

Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness. This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness. Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.

","A Beautiful Mind Director Ron Howard has experience in playing with his audience's heartstrings. Remember in Apollo 13, when the fate of the astronauts was uncertain? (Ok, so if you remember your recent history, you knew.... but still!) Or remember in Parenthood, when Steve Martin's kid was about to make the crucial catch? Ol Opie can still pluck those strings with the best of them. (And you know, he'll never stop being called Opie, even by those of us who never saw The Andy Griffith Show during its initial run.) And plucking heartstrings is not a bad thing at all, not when you can do it in such a sincere, noncloying way as the masterful Beautiful Mind presents to its viewers.<br/><br/>John Nash is a mathematics prodigy who has a decided knack at solving previously unsolvable problems. He's socially dysfunctional, rarely looking anyone in the eye, but pours all of his energy - and soul - into producing one original idea, an idea that will distinguish him from all of the other mathemathical minds at Princeton University.<br/><br/>But John, like most who have had movies made about them, had his ups and downs. He meets and falls for a beautiful student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and they produce a baby. But John also suffers from tremendous delusions and is diagnosed with a form of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia's a tough disease, folks - it's still not fully understood, and Nash was diagnosed with it in the middle of last century. He spends time in a sanitarium, as doctors struggle to find a cure."

","I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it, only that it was a true story about a mathematician whose life took a turn for the worse after taking a new job. I thought this was a espionage-math movie. This made the plot progression much more shocking, and gave the film, in my eyes, a great twist.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a man who is great at math, but not great with women. He takes on the job of breaking codes for the government, and begins to be followed and in one excellent scene, shot at. However, *SPOILERS* this is not the case, he is a schizophrenic, and it was all in his head. We see his slow recovery with fallbacks, as well as his wife's ordeals through this.<br/><br/>Starring Russell Crowe, fresh from his Best Actor win, is a radically different person here: he is meek and intelligent, as opposed to the brave and strong Maximus. I believe his performance here is better than in Gladiator. He shows more range and is convincing as the confused and sick Nash.<br/><br/>Opposite him is his wife Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly, fresh from her descent in a favourite of mine, Requiem for A Dream. She is excellent, but I think she slipped at the end in the aged finale. Her makeup/CGI is not convincing.<br/><br/>From Nash's view, the film is planted in reality, but the amazing original soundtrack makes it more like a dream. Even the intense chase is accompanied by piano. The music is great, and you notice the scenes it isn't present.<br/><br/>The direction is great, the pacing is quick, and the shooting is conventional, but that's all it needs to be.<br/><br/>Why did I describe the film as 'Hollywood at its finest""? Because the true story is far less glamorous and sympathetic. The filmmakers cut out Nash's lesser moments, like his divorce, affairs and racist rants. Also the majority of the hallucinations didn't happen. There was no roommate, no government agents in his head: the reality wouldn't make a very good film. Certainly, changes can be made to enhance a story for the screen, but this story is barely John Nash. This post-viewing knowledge soured my remembrance of the film.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a great film with great direction and acting, but strays too far from the truth.

","Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind is complex yet touching wonderful story about a Mathematics genius John Nash who suffered paranoid schizophrenia. The film covers a lifetime of a man, his ambitions, his pain, his struggles and his discoveries. And the person who took the center stage is brilliant Russell Crowe. However, it is not safe to say that the film is flawless – particularly the direction - Howard's direction is focuses and tight in first two acts. But in third act, when the Nash gets old, the film goes like a conventional tear-jerker Hollywood schmaltz. Based on the book, the screenplay is very well written by Akiva Goldsman. The film does not entirely follows Dr. Nash's life and times, and did took some creative liberties showcasing his life. Also, I wanted to see a bit more of Nash's work – the film barely touches that. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer James Horner contributed amazingly to the film. Editing in between the middle is slightly slow in pace, but I am nit-picking here. The man of the show is Russell Crowe. He brings great sense of humanity and emotions to his portrayal of John Nash. His body language, his dialog delivery is so effortless that you really think that he is John Nash. Jennifer Connelly also did a great job portraying Nash's loving wife. She was pitch perfect in many scenes, and perhaps her role itself defines the word 'Supporting'.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a well made film with wonderful performances. Although flawed, it is a film that will be remembered for Russell Crowe's beautiful performance. The film is a must watch, but it is certainly not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Beauty. The word every filmmaker wants to hear in relation to his or her work. However, achieving cinematic beauty is something else. Beauty lies in the emotion, dedication and passion of good filmmaking; beautiful films are the one's made for a purpose. This film falls into that category: it serves a purpose. It successfully investigates the implications of dealing with schizophrenia, from minor inconveniences to larger problems with the potential to deliver devastating consequences. Therefore this movie is not destined purely to entertain, but to educate. <br/><br/>The story focuses around John Nash: A mathematical genius who attends Princeton in the hope of coming up with a mathematical theory which is 'original'. Under immense pressure to meet his ambitions as well as from his classmates, Nash eventually succeeds, working his way up until he became a professor at the MIT. Here he begins to notice the effects of his growing mental illness. He marries Alicia: one of his graduates but then begins to slip into a complicated world where he cannot differentiate reality from fantasy. <br/><br/>Crowe pulls of the part brilliantly, delivering a merit- worthy performance. Equally as impressive is Jennifer Connelley with Ed Harris interjecting a solid part. The mood of the film swings, twists and warps the traditional pallet; enveloping the range of feelings of a true drama and packaging them into a complete thriller. This film is layered with emotion and passion: showcasing determination and proving that you can overcome your trials. It's pace fluctuates, making it exciting, dynamic and unpredictable, panning from quaint romance to exhilarating action. Howard succeeds in delivering a product which contains more than just pure beauty, but despair as well as joy. Wrapped up in this feature are messages that all people can draw from, whether you're ambitions and inspired or not. It reminds us all that life has its challenges, but also that those challenges can be overcome if we learn to ignore the hurdles whilst embracing the rewards. Prepare to be amazed, saddened, elated and touched by a movie which exhibits more than just the beauty of overcoming.<br/><br/>86/100"

","As a director Ron Howard likes making character pieces set to a period backgrounds. He did that with Apollo 13, Cinderella Man and Frost/Nixon, but it was A Beautiful Mind that won him the Oscar. Weirdly, I think A Beautiful Mind is a lesser film to his other films.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a bio-pic about John Nash (Russell Crowe), a Mathematical genius who created the revolutionary idea of Game Theory. Starting with his life as a PHD student at Princeton University Nash where he starts to see the world in a certain light. After impressing his professors Nash get to work at MIT and advices the Pentagon on code breaking. He is recruited by William Parcher (Ed Harris), an intelligence agent for the CIA. Parcher tells Nash of a plot by the Soviet to blow up a nuclear bomb on US soil and communicate with their sleepers through codes in magazines. Nash forms a relationship with a beautiful woman, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), but as he becomes more paranoid, Nash view of reality is altered.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a slow burning type of film, where the story and the character development is built over time. It is a serious drama that was designed as an actors film. And the actor was really good and that is what you would except from this cast. Crowe was really good and it was believed he lost the Oscar because of his outer acting activities. I really like Jennifer Connelly as an actress and she has shown talent in her roles: the highlight of her performance was when her relationship with Nash starts to break down and flex her acting muscles. Paul Bettany is another actor I really like and his role was to add a little comic relief to the film. And Ed Harris was able to give a more sinister performance, a little like his role in The Truman Show. He is also a little like the spies in The Good Shepherd, even dressing the same.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a film about mental issues, a subject that is hard to be put onto screen because it is an internal issue and people experience it differently. But Howard does his best to visualise it, with Nash hallucinating events, seeing numbers and patterns and codes jump out from the pages. It was when the film truly comes to life when it is relieved that Nash is delusional and how his mind made up its own form of reality.<br/><br/>But reading Nash's real story there was some even more strange behaviour. One example was because of his paranoid that he tried to flee America and renounce his American citizenship. Or when he was delusional he when on anti-Semitic rants blaming Jews for World Communism. It is interesting how his delusional were based on Cold War fears and the whole idea of the Red Scare that was common for the period. It was a great way for the right wing to try and keep people in control and force through their agenda: they still do it today. Plus the real Robert Nash had a number of affairs and had a child out of wedlock.<br/><br/>Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a good film, but it is typical Oscar bait. 7.5/10."

","Granted, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is nowhere close to a classic and certainly not one of 2001's best film. But the hard work and effort put into this movie by Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman should not go ignored. Especially Goldsman who was responsible for that god-awful fallacy that is ""Batman and Robin"". This biopic follows the life of mathematical genius with a mental illness, John Nash the many obstacles he conquered over the years. I won't delve into the plot too much as there's a major plot twist in the midway point of the movie that turns the tables on the scenes before it.<br/><br/>Heard from other people around me, ""A Beautiful Mind"" historical portrayal of John Nash is not 100% in terms of accuracy, but I was willing to forgive that knowing that a movie had many times before this one has utilized exaggerated dramatic effect to appeal to the mass. In fact, I'm giving praise of the structure it was to making this movie and what its intentions were which was to marvel at a mentally ill man's triumphs to win the prestigious Nobel Prize in 1994. So in way this movie can come across as a well-effort feel-good movie in its own merits.<br/><br/>Although hands off for the efforts of Howard's direction and Goldsman's script, it is not the real reason why this film is just average. I don't even think they should earned the Oscars awards they unceremoniously received. Howard lacks in subtlety and just can't get his grip on a simple planned drama. Many of the scene's emotional stages are overdone and cliché laden, like breaking stuff in anger, crying and pouting, nothing really new here. But to be fair I will say that the pacing was reasonable, and it feels as the scenes progress it looks very immaculate.<br/><br/>The last and final minutes is the weakest scene. Sure I was proud when Nash finally won the Nobel Prize, but it's the clichéd heartfelt speech that made me cringe and it clearly neglects what the movie was originally intended to accomplish. Sure Howard wasn't trying to spoonfeed us with how the film plods along, but to spoil us with the obvious message could have easily been handled earlier in the movie instead of dragging on for two hours. <br/><br/>Okay now that I've pointed most of the bad points of this movie, I still thought it had plenty to offer to the audience. It comes from the scintillating performances by Russell Crowe as mentally unbalanced John Nash and Jennifer Connolly as his wife Alicia Larde Nash who just amazed me and had me begging her for more screen time. It's a crying shame that we know very little about her and what she did in her lifetime that she was providing for him in his later years. Crowe captures the essence of Nash's character, but his tics look more like acting rather than playing it natural. There was a very meager love story between John and Alicia, and there's no purpose as to why she's smitten for Nash.<br/><br/>Schizophrenia is the main topic dealt with in the movie. And even though I have Aspberger's Syndrome, which is another mental illness, I have some knowledge of what it's like to carry a burden like what Mr. Nash carries. I guess I could say this movie fends off some of the misconceptions other movie's have dealt with on the topic of this illness this one might come the closest to being the most accurate in its portrayal.Sure it may have a Hollywood feel to the premise, the intentions of ""A Beautiful Mind"" are credited for taking the approach sensitively."

","Mathematical genius John Nash is a man whose life story seems tailor-made for a movie. Of course once Hollywood gets its hands on anyone's story true-life details are changed, things are jazzed up to make things seem more dramatic than they actually were. In A Beautiful Mind though the Hollywood treatment works and is actually quite understandable. In order for his film to succeed director Ron Howard had to somehow take us inside the mind of the schizophrenic John Nash. Howard pulls this off brilliantly and that more than anything else is what enables the film to succeed. It's not the entirely true story of John Nash's life but it's close enough. And the story that is presented here is undeniably compelling, dramatic and entertaining. It was a very challenging story to tell and Howard, helped no doubt by his stellar cast, pulls it off wonderfully. A Beautiful Mind is a rousing success.<br/><br/>In order for this film to work the actor portraying the brilliant but troubled Nash would have to be rather brilliant himself. And Russell Crowe is definitely up to the task. He hits all the right notes, capturing the tremendous highs and terrifying lows of Nash's life. From the young man we first meet at Princeton to the old man who has accomplished and overcome so much it is an incredible journey for John Nash. And Crowe is dead-on perfect throughout. He makes you believe in John Nash and makes you understand what is going on inside his mind. What exactly is going on inside that mind? A very complicated question that but the film portrays Nash in a way that draws you in and makes you pull for him as he battles his own inner demons.<br/><br/>Nash himself is obviously the film's most important character and thus Crowe's performance the most important and ultimately the most memorable. But this is a film in which the acting is uniformly terrific. After Crowe it is Jennifer Connelly who would be the next real standout with her portrayal of Nash's wife Alicia. Through all the ups and downs Alicia is right there with John and Connelly turns in a powerful, highly charged, emotional performance. The strength of both the actress and the character she portrays adds so much to the film. Also noteworthy is Ed Harris who gets to portray a mysterious, menacing character around whom much of the film's drama swirls. And the list of fine performances goes on and on. Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Josh Lucas...every performer plays their part so well. All the performances combine with a great, fascinating story to make this a film which captivates throughout. Not every great story makes for a great movie. This one does."

You had to sort out for yourself what was reality, just as Nash must have had to. And you soon develop a connection to the main character, seeing the world through his eyes.<br/><br/>But then the director gets in touch with his inner ""Opie"" and takes you back to Mayberry. Lots of saccharine sentiments and an ending that Aunt Bee would've been proud of (though Jennifer Connelly's make-up was about as unconvincing as any I've ever seen).<br/><br/>Still, it was an entertaining and very watchable show.

","The movie about highly skilled mathematician John Forbes Nash first seemed to me, as if it's going to be a mediocre try to show the life of a special, but uninteresting person. Until the great twist, that comes so unexpected it is entertaining, but not very outstanding. Though it really develops to a well-acted movie about the dramatic life of this poor man, and seeing this man being destroyed by himself is so stirring, that boredom soon is replaced by sympathy for Nash and his wife, who suffer badly under the circumstances that nearly destroy his life. Unfortunately the more this movie tries to be dramatic, the more Hollywood kitsch annoys the audience, so people who like happy ends will be satisfied. Beside that, it's a pity that only this special part of his life is shown to the audience, so we get more information about his tragic fate than about himself and his work.<br/><br/>Still it is a really good movie about an interesting person, well acted by Russell Crowe, which is worth its money and I can definitely recommend it."

The star/actor sinks his teeth into the part and delivers a performance that can silence even his worst critics. To state this as his finest work, would truly be an understatement. Jennifer Connelly is superb as Nash's Spouse. She performs like never before, and is at par with Crowe in several scenes. Paul Bettany is effective. Ed Harris is, as always, note-worthy. Josh Lucas is good. Christopher Plummer is restrained.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'A Beautiful Mind' is a Remarkable Film in all respects! One of the Greatest True Stories, translate, into becoming, One of the Greatest Films of it's time! Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"matthewah101","9","0","1","8 April 2010"," A Beautiful Mind is a powerful work of cinema and is Ron Howard's most mature film to date.
","Ron Howard is a descent director. He made film that are good and made films that aren't good. But if there's one film that Ron Howard did managed to make which was close to perfection that would be A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is the story of the life of the famous mathematician named John Nash (played by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe) as the movie starts off with him as an undergraduate at Princeton University. Nash is a very awkward person and seems to have some ""issues,"" but he is a natural born genius. He meets a peculiar fellow named Charles Herman (played by Paul Bettany) who happens to be his roommate and the two get along quite well. He meets other colleagues like Martin Hansen (played by Josh Lucas), Sol (played by Adam Goldberg), Ainsley (played by Jason Gray-Stanford) and Bender (played by Anthony Rapp) who will help Nash later in his life.<br/><br/>Time goes on and Nash gets hired by a man named William Parcher (played by Ed Harris) who hires Nash for a secret military operation that involves Russian attacking the US with nuclear bombs. Nash also meets the lovely Alicia Larde (played by Jennifer Connelly) while teaching a class at MIT in which both of them have some sort of liking between the two of them.<br/><br/>The movie goes on as Nash battles between keeping his love interest, his job, and his sanity.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a fascinating work of cinema. What I adore about this movie is the acting. Russell Crowe is phenomenal in this movie and basically stoled the show. He turned from strong, warlike gladiator to odd mentally, challenged mathematician and still turned out to be great! The screenplay and the dialogue are exceptionally well. How the plot gradually unfolds is baffling and the dialogue is very realistic and not exaggerated. Overall, this film is great; however, there are some tiny problems that I have with it but it's still great. It's great because it shows the tribulations of mental illness and how it can affect the people around you. It shows that love is more than meets the eye. It shows that caring for someone doesn't mean giving up on them because they have an incurable problem.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has presented us with a movie that is both entertaining and emotionally stratifying that it is worth your time to see this near-perfected work of art. A Beautiful Mind; it's beautiful for a reason."

"jonathanruano","7","0","2","4 April 2010"," A Beautiful Mind
","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" has been popularly considered a masterpiece. Certainly the film is very well acted. Russel Crowe delivers a remarkable performance as the highly gifted mathematician John Nash verging on madness. Jennifer Connelly gives a capable performance as Nash's wife Alicia. Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and others also put in good performances. The movie is also technically impressive and the musical soundtrack is wonderful, except for that Charlotte Church song at the end. But ""A Beautiful Mind"" is only a superficial masterpiece because it never achieves greatness.<br/><br/>I have not reached this conclusion lightly. I gave this film considerable thought because, although I instinctively thought that something big was missing, I was not sure what that something was. Then it struck me. The problem with ""A Beautiful Mind"" is really its tendency to oversimplify its subject matter. Great films force people to think and usually require more than one viewing to be understood. But Director Ron Howard's fault is in making films, like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" that explain everything to the audience in very simple terms. Howard does not seem to understand that the people who go to see films, like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" do not like an oversimplified story, because simplicity is boring. In making this criticism, I am referring to scenes like the one where John Nash's brilliant mathematical insight was explained in a very basic analogy of several men completing for one blonde woman in a bar. These men decide to change their strategy by working together toward a lesser goal - going after the brunettes - so that they all get laid. As I saw this scene, I realized that Ron Howard cares far more about towing the line of the Hollywood establishment than with the art of filmmaking. Hollywood's unspoken assumption has been for the last 30 years to oversimplify every story in order to make a film understandable even to unintelligent viewers and in the process get more people to buy theatre tickets. When set against this deplorable standard, ""A Beautiful Mind"" delivers.<br/><br/>The only trick that ""A Beautiful Mind"" has up its sleeve is that the world that the John Nash character imagines is actually real. But once that trick is exposed, the plot is completely bereft of original ideas. Thereafter, the story line goes through all the motions of resolving the conflict and arriving at a happy ending -- and the experience of watching this film becomes boring and predictable. Even the ending, which is as artificial as the one in ""2012,"" can be anticipated by the middle of this film. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not a bad film. It can be quite interesting at times. But there is something lacking and artificial about this movie because it is all based on a trick on the mind - that we are in the beginning not sure about whether John Nash's weltanschauung is real or not. After we discover the trick, the only thing that we have left to do is wait for the movie to end. Russell Crowe's performance is worthy of an Oscar and yet by the same token the John Nash character is let down by the screenplay and direction. There is no attempt made to explain the complexities of the John Nash character. We are simply told that he has gone mad and to accept that. Considering all the great films that have gone much further in adding depth and fascination to their characters, the John Nash of this picture (he is much more interesting in real life) is a bit of a let down. There is also little effort made in explaining the wonders of mathematics, even though John Nash appreciated the potential of his craft well enough to come up with some very unique ideas. Instead math and madness are reduced to mcguffins for a simple love story between John and Alicia that never was. The real Alicia Nash divorced her husband during his prolonged spell with madness.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

"plehman81","6","0","1","15 March 2010"," Cast can't salvage poor script
","The 2001 film 'A Beautiful Mind' is the adapted story of Nobel Prize winning Mathematician John Forbes Nash. The film tells a coming of age story that focuses on John Nash and his struggles to overcome adversity as a scholar and as a genius schizophrenic. The film is directed by Ron Howard and features a rich cast of actors including: Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Josh Lucas and Paul Bettany. <br/><br/>The film begins following the life of Nash, played by Russell Crowe, and his early work as a Graduate Student at Princeton University. After some key introductions to fellow students such as Martin Hansen played by Josh Lucas, and Nash's roommate simply known as Charles played by Paul Bettany, the film focuses on Nash's struggle to come up with an original idea that will earn him the recognition he eagerly desires within the academic community. Eventually Nash publishes a work that earns him the recognition he seeks and greatly impacts the field of economics. The film then shifts forward in time to Nash's career at MIT, where he and some of his class mates are working for the University as teachers and in cooperation with the United States military. During this part of the film, Nash meets a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, who invites him to work on top secret military code breaking projects but forbids him from discussing the operations with anyone. Nash is also introduced to the young Alicia played by Jennifer Connelly and eventually the two are married. The film then focuses on Nash's downward spiral into paranoid behavior that lands him in a mental institution where he discovers that his college roommate Charles and the government official Parcher are only figments of his imagination and symptoms of his disease. Nash is then confronted with the hardships of raising his family and dealing with the side effects of his medication. Nash then stops taking his medication and the pseudo-climax is reached during confrontation with his wife and his Doctor over this decision. Nash decides that rather than continue his medication he can use logic and reason to force himself to realize the characters he has created in his mind are not real. With the support of his wife Alicia, Nash returns to Princeton and his college class mate Hansen where he eventually begins to teach again. The film then concludes with Nash's consideration for and receipt of the Nobel Prize for his contribution to economics as a Graduate Student. <br/><br/>All essential components of a good film are available alongside a cast of capable and talented actors. The cinematography employs effective techniques that complement the theme of the film. There is a fresh mix of both obvious and subtly disguised uses of lighting that are key indicators to the character's state of mind, yet all the lighting is used in very natural ways that add to the believability of the film. Sound is another key aspect of the film that complements the theme. Using very little background music or distracting sound effects the film relies on clear visual imagery in most of the key communication. However, these positive attributes aren't quite enough to pull the film out of its lackluster script.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is nothing new to movie goers and film fans. A coming of age story mixed with ideas of complex human relationships set on the back drop of mental illness. You can imagine a dry and flavorless blending of 'Rainman' and 'Good Will Hunting,' though Nash never achieves the endearing quirks of Raymond (Rainman) or the impressive brilliance and genius angst of Will Hunting. Unfortunately the film's focus on the character of Nash and his ""beautiful mind"" leaves much to be desired. Crowe's performance does nothing to endear the character to the audience and does little to produce affect on the viewer. The viewer ends up feeling more attached to the characters that are invented by Nash and exist only in his head. The film never builds a clear climax and it only drags out and teases at the conflict that the main character ignores. Comparatively, the film 'Good Will Hunting' develops a main character that the audience can identify with and root for, whereas the character of Nash is Luke warm and uninteresting. Additionally, 'Good Will Hunting' develops a full plot that includes exposition, complication, and climax, where 'A Beautiful Mind' simply continues to cycle the exposition and complication stages of the film."

","The audience is expected to dump a dozen scenes as simply delusions halfway through this slow drift into a brick wall of a film. What might have been an inspired rendering of the life of an interesting man became a quasi X-Files episode that stopped abruptly and left the audience dangling, then the film is deflty dropped into the cold hands of a contrite and abominable psychiatrist. I bought a copy on DVD for a friend and was disappointed that it was so blighted a production. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Something cannot be called a delusion if it is shooting at you from a moving vehicle. Oh that was just a dramatic device to illustrate psychosis. Right.

Well it's not the case here, because A beautiful mind is a very provocative, intelligent drama which may not be receptive to mass public, a possible reason for it's poor rating.I loved the thin line between reality and fantasy, between health and mental illness, line which becomes clearer and clearer as we approach the end, i might say a tragic, but not so tragic one - depending on every ones judgment.<br/><br/>Last but not least, what i find of particular importance is the message this drama delivers: when you can't defeat schizophrenia or any other illness, acceptance can be just as comforting as the hope for a miraculous cure.<br/><br/>All being said I hope I made my point, A beautiful mind is without a doubt in my mind, the most intense and provocative film of the 00's so far, and i rate it 9/10."

","Right, so with over a thousand comments (or reviews; whichever way you want to put it) why should you read this one if you chanced upon this? Well coz' this is about as honest as it can get from a pure movie-lover.<br/><br/>If you want to really find out about the guy (John Nash) on whom this movie is based on, then you're better off reading about him on Wikipedia or watching a documentary called ""A Brilliant Madness"". While this movie appears to be a biopic on the genius-troubled-mathematician John, it actually portrays a lot of factual errors. So flawed as it may be it does come good in showing the spirit of the guy in discussion which no one dares question.<br/><br/>I actually didn't enjoy the movie completely mainly because I saw through the script some time back even though I didn't know anything about the movie before watching it. I guess when you have seen quite a lot of movies on similar themes such as Fightclub, The Machinist... where the central character imagines things and people that are not, it's not hard for you to ""predict"" what's gonna happen. But then as the movie neared it's end I realized the movie is not so much of a puzzle as it is about the life of a brilliant mathematician told through a movie. So I started appreciating the movie at the end and it's suffice to say that I wasn't totally disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie is best enjoyed without any strings attached; cos' the movie actually takes a lotta liberties with the original book it was based on. But the biggest flaw in my view has to be Russel Crowe who doesn't seem to fit the role he'd been given. I'd rather see him play roles like The Gladiator and these kind of roles should be reserved for more versatile actors like Johnny Depp. All in all a 7/10 seems good enough for this one."

First of all, Russell Crowe gives an amazing and breath taking performance, but even more amazing than his performance was that of Jennifer Connelly. The chemistry between Connelly and Crowe was spectacular and believable, and contributed a lot to the greatness of the movie. It does not surprise me one bit that Connelly won the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. She surely deserves it. I am slightly disappointed that Crowe did not win the Oscar for best actor. He portrayed John Nash perfectly from every emotion to every subtle movement, never over doing his part. The movie as a whole is a series of ups and downs. Your emotions will be thrown all around, and sometimes you'll just want to cry. The movie is brilliant and has a twist you would never see coming.

","This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well. Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia. In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that. Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe. I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination). The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes. Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today. New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc. Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married. Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and his accomplishments."
"tenthousandtattoos","8","0","1","24 October 2007"," Quite simply a brilliant movie
","Don't read this if you have NOT seen the movie. You've been warned.<br/><br/>A brilliant, well-written (Akiva Goldsman) drama, a semi-fictionalised account of the life of renowned mathematician and schizophrenic, John Nash. Nash is played by Russell Crowe, in one of the few roles I've seen him in where he has NOT annoyed the heck out of me. He just seems too arrogant and full of himself.<br/><br/>Anyway, A Beautiful Mind begins with Nash's early years at Princeton University, and follows him to the time he was awarded the Nobel Prize. It charts his decline into schizophrenia very well, including a whopper of a twist that I did not see coming in a million years. Like John's friends and associates, I believed every word, no matter how far-fetched it all seemed after a while.<br/><br/>I applaud any film that deals with mental illness in a serious way and doesn't poke fun at it. Aside from the fact that every Hollywood movie (and this one is NO exception) seems to feel the need to show at least one person gently rocking back and forth whenever we are shown a mental institution. I find it so bizarre that the ""gentle rocker"" seems to show up all the time...what condition is it that they think this guy has? Too much LSD while head banging to a Slayer concert? <br/><br/>HERE COMIN'THE BIG SPOILS people: That aside, A Beautiful Mind is a very well made film. Guaranteed if you enjoy it you'll want to see it a second time to spot all the William Parcher moments (my two favourites are when he first appears to talk to John outside the University dorm, and he just ""appears"" at the top of the stairs, you never see him actually open the door and walk through, nor do you hear it close behind him, because of course, he's not really there. And my other favourite is passing the security gate, where the guard doesn't notice Archer at all. I kicked myself for not picking that up the first time around!) The Paul Bettany character of Charles, Nash's imaginary roommate, is so awesome and such a great character that I found myself wishing he WAS real, and I genuinely felt sorry for him when Nash finally tells him he's not going to acknowledge him any more. I was feeling sorry for a figment of someone's imagination! Bettany is a legend, a great actor in my opinion (he's also terrific in another Crowe film, Master and Commander, and is even very good in the crappy rom-com Wimbledon).<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly plays Nash's wife, Alicia, who stuck by him all through his worst years, when his delusions were basically controlling his entire existence. Connelly never gets too teary-eyed or melodramatic, and has a strength in her eyes that compliments her picturesque beauty.<br/><br/>Crowe's shuffling John Nash is great, a far-cry from Hando in Romper Stomper, let me tell you! He plays the sort of messed-up yet-still-smugly-intellectual character that should be worthy of derision but ends up being the exact opposite."

","Deep down, I feel that the topic of mental illness is a touchy and hard topic to cover for Hollywood. In regards to schizophrenia, A Beautiful Mind is currently, and by far, the best story in order to remotely comprehend what a family endures and overcomes when a member of their family is stricken with the illness. The story of John Nash is an intriguing one at the least.<br/><br/>Taking an idea from Adam Smith one step further, Princeton mathematician John Nash revolutionizes economics and lands a job at M.I.T. The Pentagon also hires him to crack codes against the Communists.<br/><br/>The movie takes its time picking up, as we get to know the anti-social Nash and his lifestyle. When the symptoms of an illness become apparent, we haven't seen the worst by far. There is no action or danger that would draw you into A Beautiful Mind. On the contrary, this movie is the dramatic story of an economic genius whom we get to know. Incredibly, his genius constantly struggles with madness everyday."

","A Beautiful Mind is an excellent drama that has everything you would want: suspense, sadness, happiness, comedy, an engrossing plot, and good characters (although it doesn't have any real action, except for one sequence that comes to mind). It follows the life of John Nash (acted by Russel Crowe), a mathematician who graduated from Princeton. If you don't have any background on the movie before watching it (like me), then there is a pretty nice plot twist towards the beginning that completely changes the direction of the film.<br/><br/>The film is excellent at illustrating the troubles that Nash encounters throughout his career. Its one of those things that just thinking about could drive you insane. But there are plenty of supporting characters (and opposing characters, that are quite complex) to help him out. In the end, the film gives a feel-good conclusion.<br/><br/>I didn't find the film to be spectacular in any one category, but everything came together to make a neat experience. Its one of those films where you are introduced to a completely different personality than yourself. This makes you think about all those things you haven't taken time to learn about (in this case, mathematics, schizophrenia, and a Nobel laureate's life). Then your left satisfied because you learned some things and had fun. This is a film you'll love if you like dramas."

","I was shocked not to see this film in the IMDb Top 250. This is arguably Ron Howard's finest work to date. Based on the true story of John Nash, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an entertaining, enlightening and passionate drama which tackles the tribulations of a mathematical genius suffering from schizophrenia.<br/><br/>Nash is played by Academy Award winner Russell Crowe (for his portrait of Maximus in ""Gladiator""). In my opinion, this is Crowe's finest performance up to date, in which he was nominated for the ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" Oscar but only being beaten by Denzel Washington's flawless work in ""Training Day"". (Actually, Sean Penn was even better in ""I Am Sam""). Jennifer Connelly also gives us an honest portrayal of the confused but devoted Alicia Nash, which earned her the Oscar for ""Best Actress in a Supporting Role"". The rest of the cast was superb.<br/><br/>The amazing work by Howard, Akiva Goldsman and Brian Grazer enabled the movie to have an excellent screenplay and of course, a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow it to be.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece. 9/10"
"johnnyboyz","8","0","3","15 August 2007"," Beautifully shot, made, acted and put across - a real gem of a film.
","Yes, it's probably been said a million times by a million different people in a million different reviews but A Beautiful Mind really is a beautiful film. The film is smart, engaging and entertaining in its own way  even the fact it's based on a real person and loosely on a true story is even more fascinating. A Beautiful Mind is really just a life story but what a life. Dealing with mathematician John Nash (who I admit hadn't heard of before) and his life of genius and love as well as the more darker sides of his life or that of mental illness is a joy to behold and it's done in such a way that it engages the viewer, putting them there with Nash (Crowe) the whole way through.<br/><br/>What I really liked about A Beautiful Mind is its intelligence. The film gets straight into business as Nash starts university in 1940s America; this is where we learn the most about him although half the information we're given we're not even aware of its importance. We see that Nash is, in truth, a genius but we also see a more unnatural side to his persona. His first friendship is with a roommate called Charles (Bettany) who I noticed is pretty much the exact opposite in terms of kind of person to that of Nash. He didn't entirely fit in with his other co-students outside and thus doesn't fit in yet this 'jock' mysteriously takes to him from the off. Clever and confusing film-making that pays off later on.<br/><br/>Nash's and Charles' exchanges are often kept to settings where only the two of them are in immediate vicinity  the film further attempts to play with us when Charles' niece is introduced; furthering the character of Charles and further playing tricks on us for reasons that become revealed. Nash also develops throughout this segment as the 40s turn into the 50s. In all honesty, I became very suspicious of Charles the more of a friend he became and it's no coincidence that the more we see Nash doing what it is he does; the more we are tempted to label him a 'crazy' more so than 'genius'. This is due to the fact he's seen doing some pretty erratic things like multiple complex sums, tearing out magazine articles and basically trying to crack a code that isn't there. Once again, fantastic film-making  dragging you in and playing with you.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the film is it's espionage theme. This creates conflict in the film, giving Nash a reason to do the things he does  One small thing can trigger off several large things in Nash's mind. This is evident when he visits the pentagon to crack a code yet becomes so involved in it all that another character named Parcher (Harris) becomes involved in his life. Arguably, the scenes involving Parhcer and the results of Nash's actions because of Parcher often make for the film's best and most gripping bits not to mention that they enable the film to drop its most evident clues yet regarding the truth. A further example of a small, seemingly insignificant item causing chaos is when Nash spots the word 'Soviet' in a newspaper and his illness flairs up again. These espionage scenes create the conflict as the domestic issues intensify.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a very powerful and well made film that just seems to feel like something Nash's life centres around: a mathematics puzzle. It's not one of those Mullholland Drive sort of visual jigsaw puzzle type films but it has the right balance of good character development, strong acting performances and intelligence that allows it to drop clues as to what might happen later."
"Sylviastel","10","0","2","19 February 2007"," A Princeton State of Mind!
","The cost of brilliance might be madness. You don't need to look further than the brilliant math genius John Nash played here by Oscar Winner Russell Crowe. He should have won another Academy Award for Best Actor in this role. It's not easy at Princeton University. They probably didn't flinch an eyeball in their ivy digs over the Oscars. It's the kind of university where it takes a whole lot to impress those ivy geniuses. After all, they have Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, author Joyce Carol Oates, and Nobel prize winners on their faculty as well. Ron Howard said he loved filming in Princeton, New Jersey which doesn't seem to fit in the rest of stereotypical New Jersey. It's like another world of it's own where geniuses discuss politics, history, economics, math, and literature. It's hardly believable that some of them probably don't own television sets because they think it's waste of time and a distraction but they probably have computers instead. Princeton is a state of mind and a place where the mind is valued more than the body. With brilliance comes madness for John Nash. Ron Howard creates a beautiful film based on John Nash's story of suffering and demons that battles his mind for control. I like the casting of Judd Hirsch and Jennifer Connolly as the loving, devoted wife. John Nash will be remembered for this film more than his brilliance but that he was human just like the rest of us."
"ackstasis","8","0","3","18 February 2007"," ""I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.""
","John Forbes Nash was an American mathematician, a reclusive but brilliant man who harboured his own share of mysterious demons. 'A Beautiful Mind' first finds him during an informal welcome to Princeton University, alone against the back wall, staring at his own feet. His mind off elsewhere, Nash doesn't even listen to the inspirational introductory speech, but is instead  most likely  contemplating the original mathematical theory that he believes will make him great. Of course, he hasn't formulated this theory yet, but he is so supremely confident of his brilliance that, for him, it is inevitable.<br/><br/>Refusing to attend his classes on the basis that they will ""dull your mind"" and ""destroy the potential for authentic creativity,"" Nash spends much of his time in his room, gazing out at the grass courtyard below, furiously chalking on the windows to try and discover an algebraic pattern to the movements of everyday life - a flock of pigeons around scraps of bread, a makeshift football game, the chase of a man who has stolen a purse. Nash is so assuredly confident in his mind's own abilities that he has long learned to ignore the aid of those around him. Upon losing a game of Go to a fellow student, Nash tries desperately to figure out what went wrong, recalling ""I had the first move, my play was perfect,"" before declaring that ""the game is flawed.""<br/><br/>This complete dependence upon his own mind makes it even more difficult when Nash is told that he is suffering from schizophrenia. Afterall, if it is his mind itself that is the problem, how could he possibly use his own impeccable logic to solve it? Most likely, Nash decides, it is everybody else who must be wrong.<br/><br/>Despite winning the 2000 Best Actor Oscar for ""Gladiator,"" it is in this film that Russell Crowe delivers his greatest performance, announcing unquestionably to the world that he is one of the most gifted talents of his generation. Contrasting starkly with his previous character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, John Nash is shy and softly-spoken, often exhibiting a complete disregard for social conventions.<br/><br/>With his first spoken lines, Nash insults a man's choice of necktie, before informing another fellow student that ""there's not one seminal or innovative idea"" in either of his pre-prints. Unaware on how to communicate with women, Nash sometimes matter-of-factly declares to an interested female, ""I don't exactly know what I am required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me. But could we assume that I said all that,"" before requesting that they cut straight to the ""fluid exchange."" This statement is often met with a nasty slap to the face.<br/><br/>Nash initially struggles through his time at Princeton University, simply unable to inspire that ""truly original idea"" that is ""the only way he will ever distinguish himself the only way he will ever matter."" He has few friends; his only true support comes from his chatty, laid-back roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany). After graduating from Princeton, Nash becomes a doctor of mathematics, but, to his disgruntlement, his duties include teaching a class. It is here that he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who is able to accept him for the man he is, but soon sets about giving him a ""beautiful heart"" in addition to his ""beautiful mind."" However, Nash's world is suddenly plunged into chaos when a federal agent named Parcher (Ed Harris) approaches him to perform top-secret code-breaking work for the Department of Defense.<br/><br/>'A Beautiful Mind' is a haunting and inspirational biopic from Ron Howard (""Apollo 13""), who gives us perhaps his greatest film to date. Adapted by Akiva Goldsman from the biography by Sylvia Nasar, this film features terrific performances from a stellar cast, including a phenomenal Russell Crowe at the top of his game. You could argue that the screenplay sometimes embellishes on the truth for dramatic effect, but this can be easily forgiven in light of the often heart-wrenching drama we witness on screen. After all, like I've always said, ""don't let the truth get in the way of a good story!"""

","I love movies. Good movies, bad movies, all kinds of movies. But only a select few evoke an emotional response in me. The rest are simple entertainment. This movie proved to be a truly emotional experience. I walked out of the theater wondering if the people around me were actually there, doubting my own sanity. For a short while after having watched this film I developed a fascination for John Nash. Latter I heard him interviewed on NPR and was thrilled by both his brilliance and humor. That interview only made the movie even more dear to me, bringing home once again the reality of it all. The only movies I can think of to compare with ""A Beautiful Mind"" are Cassasblanca and The Wizard of Oz. Oh, I understand that the three have nothing in common as per plot, setting, etc. But they have THIS in common ... They are cinematic art at its finest. Thats what ""A Beautiful Mind"" is.

","The movie ""A Beautiful Mind"" is about the life of a noble prize winner John Nash. It shows how he get past all the obstacles and changes in his life to get to his success in the end. The genius John Nash goes through phases of conversions. The first phase is when he is normal and goes to Princeton and graduated after his mathematical theory proves to be correct. Then he moves on to the second phase in which he works in this agency and starts seeing imaginary people and hidden patterns which he believes it relates to military and the federal government. The next phase is when he marries his wife and diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has to take medicines to treat this sickness. He was fine for a while but the imaginary people comes back after he stops taking the pills. It not only distracts him but also threatens his relationship with his family. The next phase is when he finally has the determination to fight the sickness and ignores imaginary people and gets on with his work. He has a delightful family and he's also a professor at Princeton University. The last phase is him finally getting paid off with his hard work in his specialty and winning the noble prize. This movie demonstrates a person has to go through many changes or conversions in order to gain success in the end. That person also needs to be courageous, fearless and relentless to get past barriers that are holding him back from accomplishments. This is a fantastic movie that illustrates those ideas."

","As has been pointed out, this film leaves out crucial details from Nash's life in order to give him wider appeal. Taken on its own terms it's just another medical tearjerker, like ""Awakenings"". Even Nash's delusions, the best scenes in the film, are made conventional. <br/><br/>It's still worth seeing because of the acting, above all from Harris, Bettany, and Crowe. Harris and Bettany both have great presence and are memorable without overdoing things. And Crowe not only gets Nash's strange manner and West Virginia accent down but does a believable elderly version (in make-up). The screenwriter has sugared up Alicia (who was also ambitious) into a benevolent earth mother, but Connelly does a decent job given that she has to spend most of her role whimpering things like ""Talk to me!"" or ""You're sick, baby"", or gazing worriedly at Nash, or just screaming. (We never find out who this Alicia was before she became Mrs. Nash, so her crisis doesn't amount to anything.) I also like Josh Lucas as Nash's hotshot competitor, Adam Goldberg as his college chum, and especially Judd Hirsch as his adviser (Hirsch demonstrates perfectly the old maxim: ""Don't act; think."")"
"SpinalTapFan","7","0","2","14 October 2006"," Too imperfect to deserve so many Oscars, but a well-made and challenging work all the same
","As with fellow Oscar-winner Monster, this biopic has received criticism for a few inaccuracies regarding the real life of the subject. Those in A Beautiful Mind are more worthy of criticism, or of clarification at the very least.<br/><br/>From what I gather, the portrayal of schizophrenia is not accurate. John Nash did not visualise people, he merely heard their voices and interpreted them his own way. This limits the film's worth on an educational side, but does allow the film to take on more drama for those unfamiliar with Nash's life.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the other big issue, the inaccuracies as to his romantic life. Not only is Nash's older son ignored, Alicia being from El Salvador originally is also overlooked, and their divorce and remarriage is not mentioned either.<br/><br/>Worse to some, Nash's past rumoured bisexual relationships are airbrushed away. I don't feel the writers should however be blamed for this, for two reasons. Firstly, Nash claims that he had a level of identity crisis during his schizophrenic times, and attributes any dalliances with men to these. Hardly a view likely to be well-received by gay viewers, much less Hollywood's large gay presence. Secondly, homosexuality is almost entirely ignored in mainstream cinema, unless it is integral to a true story (such as Monster), and this might not be the best film to break it thought.<br/><br/>When I first watched the film, I loved the ending - the whole 'triumph over adversity' feel combined with the touching 'I did so much wrong, but now I've found truth' speech seemed to justify everything. With the reality being somewhat different, it may instead have been phony Hollywood schmaltz. I don't know whether Nash's acceptance speech was similar to what was used in the film - if not, this is a major flaw if the film is to be viewed as a biopic.<br/><br/>For all these flaws, we are still looking at an entertaining piece of work. Nash's mathematical achievements are largely simplified or overlooked, but this is fair enough - to most people it's an over-complex or boring field. Many will have left the cinema keen to research Nash's real work, and there are many places where that can be done easily enough. The same goes for the anti-Communism hysteria and status of the Nobel Prize for Economics which are mentioned by other reviewers.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a human interest piece. A complex, flawed but gifted man struggles with complex demons and somehow comes out on top. He loses what could have been his best years, but enjoys a later-life renaissance and is accepted by the very people he once had (mutual) distrust of. Russell Crowe is superb throughout, Ed Harris is truly awesome, while Paul Bettany is perhaps best of all as Charles, who in many ways is what Nash deep down wishes he was but is convinced he is not - sociable, suave and popular with the ladies. He takes centre stage in the comic chat-up attempt in particular. If you're open-minded, but aware of what you will be viewing, give it a go."

","This is an unfaithful edit of my review of this pretty fine movie. by the staff at IMDb:<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is a shocking and beautiful actress. When my atheist friends tell me "" There is no God"", I say: How do you explain the existence of Jennifer Connelly then? That usually shuts them right up. Jennifer plays "" the wife of"" gifted mathematician John Nash. That's it. That's her role here. Second Banana to Nash, so to speak. John Nash and his wife were both students at Princeton(MIT?) although his future wife wasn't as splashy as he. She wasn't a potted plant-is all I'm saying....Nash was a mathematician of excellence. He pushed the limit of his mind and lost. This movie is a tender-hearted and artful representation of his complex and doofy and gut-wrenching and important life. This game-theorist Nash didn't realize he played a game on himself. How ironic. The game of Insanity is just another game for people who don't know when to quit. Sanity is where you quit your (failed/lost)game of life and move on. End of Story.Insanity is -sometimes-where you ask yourself to be an Intellectual Giant- without mercy or reprieve- when you might be a pretty fine Intellectual Mighty Whale instead. Nash was a fine, flawed person who wished to be Einstein. He must have hated himself unmercifully for having not achieved that. Genetics may have pointed him towards shizophrenia- I'm not an expert on this. Losing a game of Chess can be very hard to take. Nash played ""Go"" instead.I never learned how to lose at Chess. It makes you angry at the universe- if you take it too seriously. It feels like you are being humiliated by The Whole World. In reality, it's okay to fail at a game. John Nash forgot to throw the Monoply board over and start a new game. He killed his own life, by not allowing himself to quit the game:The life-game called Insanity. What a waste. In sum, this movie is good enough for Hollywood. It has a heart. I am glad I saw it. Please read the fine Sylvia Nasar book of the same title. It will thrill you and give you the background for this fairly good movie."

John Nash is given so much depth, and the character is developed so well that by the time all is revealed, even you want to believe what he believes. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly is also worth a mention in this Oscar winning performance.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is the strong supporting cast, which includes the terribly underused and underrated Ed Harris, as well as the rising Paul Bettany.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a lot to offer, it does suffer from a few inconsistencies in that it's not always sure what it wants to be. This movie could at first be perceived as a character study, but at times it wants to be a thriller, and at other times a suspense drama. If you can look past these drawbacks (if you can really go as far as to call them that), there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie absolutely worth seeing, and it would rank highly on a list of my favourite movies."

","Is a Beautiful Mind groundbreaking? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a cinematic achievement? No. Is A Beautiful Mind a drama that will change your outlook on life? Yes. Directed by Ron Howard and lead by an incredibly talented staff in writing, directing, acting, and musical score, A Beautiful Mind is leagues above the average drama and remains one of the few movies in recent years that actually did indeed deserve that Best Picture Oscar it had earned years ago. This film will make you laugh, will make you suspect, will make you cry, and will make you reflect on your life one way or another.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind follows the life of mathematician John Nash. He is an extremely intelligent man but with his genius comes problems, issues, and situations that affect not only him but also the lives of the people he cares about the most. Throughout the film, there are many surprises and unexpected turns in plot that just reveals how his methods of thinking and attempting to find solutions ultimately eats away at his life. Russell Crowe plays Nash and pretty much nails it, one of the finest performances I've ever seen. You can even see him little by little break down emotionally as well as physically as he lived on with his problems. Jennifer Connelly is just as talented as she is beautiful, as she plays the loving yet frustrated wife of John Nash. Crowe and Connelly have excellent chemistry together, and their love for each other pretty much bleeds out of the film and into your heart, as you will have a lump in your throat during their best moments shared together. Another notable good job comes from Ed Harris, who plays a cold man hiring John Nash on a top-secret mission to help find out what the Russians are doing. The acting is basically what runs this film, but much credit should be given to the writing.<br/><br/>Weaving a true-life story that needs to be told into a movie that can capture the interest of an audience is no easy task; especially involving the evil and cynical feature we all call mathematics. Fortunately for us, they kept the complicated, convoluted jargon that only true math experts can recognize to a minimum, even though there are times in which you are just better off zoning out as you see Nash engage into intricate arithmetic with other Princeton students. The story is paced well, as no section of his life is stretched way too long, nor does it ever become predictable. Ron Howard absolutely perfects his directing skills in this film, as he constantly leads the audience down one path, only to totally throw them off at the latest surprise. Kind of like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction, A Beautiful Mind may require more than one viewing in order to catch all the nifty details scattered about. Even the colors of the film are remarkably toned down as you dwell halfway into the movie.<br/><br/>It is more than a biography; it is a love story, and a story about a man attempting to defeat a seemingly impossible task of daunting past his problems. While his dilemmas are far from normal, deep down, we all can sympathize and understand what he is going through, we all can see ourselves in him as he goes through his worst moments. But unlike most life-changing, eye-watering stories, this one didn't look like there was much hope, and as the viewer, you will almost deteriorate emotionally as badly as John Nash. Nonetheless, don't get the impression that this movie should be avoided if you are currently depressed or emotionally unstable, because underneath all the drama and chaos lies hope and anticipation, lies a chance that everything will be betterthis is what life is, an ever-changing quest for happiness that contains moments of darkness that seems to find no end. A Beautiful Mind is exactly an interpretation of life, that long, sometimes awful yet rewarding road that hopefully finds its way out of the bowels of rough terrain.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A Beautiful Mind should be viewed by everybody, as it gives a not-so-typical story about a man whose fears and issues threaten to get in the way of his first love, mathematics, and his main love, his wife. Acted out almost perfectly, and directed with few faults, this movie should change the way you view things or at least reflect a bit. While the dialogue does have its bits of slowdown, especially when the complicated math starts getting involved, this film is nothing short of spectacular. Highly, highly recommend.

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>This resulted in four well-deserved Academy Awards in 2002: Best Picture for Brian Grazer and the people at Imagine Entertainment, Ron Howard for his direction, Jennifer Connelly for her supporting role, and Akive Goldsman for his script adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography. It is a beautiful and touching movie, uplifting and full of a lot of things that Hollywood does very well.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is believable as the arrogant yet vulnerable mathematician John Nash who fell into paranoid schizophrenia while an undergraduate at Princeton University. A philandering and selfish man who is paradoxically almost as lovable as Albert Einstein, Nash can also be humble and exhibit a wry, self-effacing sense of humor. To me he is a great hero, not because of his work in Game Theory for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, but because he is one of the very few people ever to conquer, as it were, schizophrenia.<br/><br/>In the outstanding documentary from The American Experience PBS series, ""A Brilliant Madness"" (2002) Nash explains how he did it: he just stopped listening to the voices. The voices that the paranoid schizophrenic hears are inside his head and they are amazingly persuasive; the delusions are as compelling as monstrous personages come to life, vivid, demanding, in many ways more ""real"" than the reality we normally experience. So it really was heroic of John Nash to come to grips with his delusions and to mentally shove them aside. The vast majority of paranoid schizophrenics can never do that.<br/><br/>Yet the movie merely resembles his life and his singular experience. Goldsman's script and Howard's direction take the life of John Nash and distill the essence of his triumph while brushing aside many of the unpleasant and non-heroic details. I don't object to this because this movie is clearly aimed at the widest possible audience, and I appreciate the wisdom of that approach. But for those of you interested in a more comprehensive and objective picture of the man I can recommend both the documentary mentioned above and Nasar's biography. I especially found it valuable to view the one-hour documentary because to actually see the man and to hear him speak allowed me to better appreciate the fine performance by Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>I found Jennifer Connelly absolutely mesmerizing as Alicia (not to mention gorgeous). Ed Harris was a hardcore graphic nightmare as the unrelenting Parcher while Paul Bettany was intriguing and clever as Nash's nonexistent buddy. Howard's direction not only got excellent work from everybody, but he was able to bring the pathos and exhilaration of Nash's life to the audience in a very satisfying way emotionally. If you can watch this without shedding a tear or two you may want to check your synaptic connections. Incidentally the makeup work on Crowe and Connelly to allow us the illusion of the passing years was outstanding (and got an Oscar nomination).<br/><br/>The key to the movie and to Howard's vision is the way that the real world and the Nash's delusional world are meshed. It's clear he wanted to compel the audience to share the paranoid schizophrenic experience. While not a paranoid schizophrenic myself I have known people who are, and I have had similar, limited experiences myself under certain, shall we say, circumstances. The sheer terror that can sometimes be felt came through in the car chase scene (yes, Howard managed to get one in) while Nash's obsessive energy was revealed on the walls of the rooms that he had completely covered with pages from magazines that he had frantically searched looking for secret Soviet codes.<br/><br/>Some quibbles: while undergraduates loved beer then as they do now, they did not in 1946 go out for pizza, and if they had they would have called it ""pizza pie."" There were no pizza parlors and no pizza at the market. If you went to an Italian restaurant you had spaghetti or ravioli, and the pizza that was served was mostly bread with a thin topping of cheese and sauce, nothing like the great thin platters we have today.<br/><br/>New Zealander Russell Crowe's West Virginia accent faded in some scenes only to return strong in another. Incidentally he is not to be confused with Cameron Crowe, who wrote the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and directed such films as Jerry Maguire (1996) and Almost Famous (2000). Russell Crowe has starred in a number of excellent movies including Proof (1991), LA Confidential (1997), The Insider (1999), etc.<br/><br/>Also, no mention in the movie is made of Nash's homosexual experiences nor of his running away to Europe or his desire to renounce his US citizenship. I understand that Howard decided to leave out the homosexual angle because associating homosexuality with schizophrenia would open a can of worms that would detract from the theme of the movie. Also left out was Nash's other paternity with a woman he never married.<br/><br/>Nash is not a saint, but he is a hero, and this beautiful movie is a fine tribute to him and to his accomplishments."
"locutus243","8","0","2","2 May 2006"," A Beautiful Film!!!
","A very poignant and heartfelt film that really touches the heart of the viewer. It follows the life of mathematician John Nash as he struggles through University and then through life trying to cope with mental illness. It does a great job of displaying schizophrenia and its effects to both the individual and those around them, and is wonderfully emotive throughout. The film is somewhat drawn out, but this befits the both complicated and intriguing nature of the subject matter. The film is not easy going, nor does it go at a thrill a minute pace, but if you like something more thoughtful that tugs on the heart strings then you can't go far wrong with A Beautiful Mind."

","Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before."

I saw social withdrawal....but it's extreme was a side effect of the drugs, so he went off of them. Did he display incoherence of speech? He mumbled at times.

But things like this are just quibbles. The film draws the viewer into what appears to be a plausible 'World of Nash', only for the whole thing to unravel before our eyes, with the realisation that much of what we have seen is mere fantasy. The film is a superb depiction of a very much misunderstood condition and a finely-crafted plea for tolerance. To my mind, the most moving part was the Nobel man deftly steering him into the tea rooms and Nash being presented with pens by his associates. I would never have watched this sort of film if I hadn't been talked into by my son. He's 16. I'm 53."

Ron Howard has done some really great films before (including Willow and Apollo 13) but this is probably his best. With Russell Crowe, he was able to convey how John Nash thought when he looked at numbers (you saw numbers flash to life here and there as the camera moved around John Nash), while the beautiful piano ballad and Charlotte Church's voice accentuated the musical atmosphere created by James Horner.

","I find that usually movies based on true stories are more appealing to watch. A Beautiful Mind was quite enjoyable to watch because although the story seemed so far-fetched, knowing that there were aspects of truth to it made the movie very interesting. Two things about the movie that I appreciated most were: 1)Alicia's love for John Nash and 2)the representation of a paranoid schizophrenic's world through their eyes.<br/><br/>People of the general public are often afraid to LIVE WITH(or near) schizophrenics, but are unaware of how much more frightening it could be to LIVE AS a schizophrenic. A Beautiful Mind provided a great depiction of the difficulties which a paranoid schizophrenic might have to endure. Russell Crowe's character, John Nash, provided viewers with a look at the scary world through the eyes of a paranoid schizophrenic. Crowe's character help others better understand that those who are ""insane"" are still human and are very well capable of feeling some of the same emotions that the ""sane"" people feel. Nash was able to relate and share the most important part of all human factors and that component was love. In subtle and indirect ways, love helped Nash realize that he was ill and love gave him the support to make it through his days. Nash was able to rebuild his life after schizophrenia through love and that makes me admire Alicia's strength to truly love him unconditionally.<br/><br/>I did some research on the real John Nash's life and it was not as beautiful as portrayed in the movie. However,on the plus side, he and Alicia are married and he is still a mathematician at Princeton.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","Russell Crowe was a good choice on portraying John Nash, but he should have done his research on Schizophrenia or the type of therapies that were done on patients with schizophrenia. This was the basic ""Hollywood"" view on people that have schizophrenia, even though Russell Crowe did a good job acting wise, there was a lot of information that wasn't told about John Nash, that would help the background of the movie, for instance that schizophrenia was shown in other family members, so it was genetic. I feel that the movie could have been set up a little differently, but movies that are based on true stories always hold things out. I guess no one really wants to watch a five-hour movie.

Tom Hanks is one of my loving actors, and now Russell Crowe will be added to my list. His appearance, his movement, his dialog, his walking, and his personality changes during different period in the movie. I find it is really a pity that he did not win the academy awards because of his bad news - he punched someone outside the hotel or something like that. AS for Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, and Paul Bettany, they all deserved the best supporting actor/actress. All the characters are very realistic. As for the director Ron Howard, he is good in adapting the story from the original novel to the screen. He deeply describes the main character - John Nash's characters, his emotions, and the relationship with his wife. The surprising in the middle of the story is quite impressive - if the audience haven't read the novel. I do love the touching ending. It made most of the people in the theater cry. At any rate, the production of this movie is brilliant, and it deserves THE BEST MOVIE for academy awards in 2002. If you haven't seen this movie, go see it.

","Although Russel Crowe proved his worth as an adept, competent actor in; A Beautiful Mind, his physique seems more appropriate for Gladiator, and films of this ilk, which require as necessary, muscle bound men. Having said this, Crowe successfully manages to permit the viewer of; A Beautiful Mind to see beyond his physique, and thereby concentrate on his adeptness in immersing himself into the character he is playing. Here, he does not need to be true to the real life person that he is playing, but rather be convincing in his role, which of course in this film he does eloquently, and sensitively in an intelligent way. For this, Crowe deserves immense critical acclaim.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the writing and directing of; A Beautiful Mind are very well executed. What director Ron Howard has managed to do here in a clever and innovative way, is to make a complex subject matter palpable, and therefore accessible to the mass audience, without being patronising. In this way Howard not only reaches his audience, but raises their awareness, and to a certain extent, their understanding of an otherwise closed subject matter, which is that of schizophrenia. This said, I'm not too sure it alleviates the fears that people have of people with a mental illness, such as schizophrenia. Nevertheless, by raising awareness and understanding of mental illness, it is irrelevant,and thereby does not matter one jot if the story of Professor Nash is off the mark, and distorted. What matters is reaching the audience, and educating them on the subject of mental illness in an intelligent, innovative way that is put into layman's terms. Although I can't be sure of Howard's intentions, and purpose when directing this film, he nevertheless manages to handle the subject matter of schizophrenia ethically. Nonetheless, whether intended or merely coincidental,the subject matter of this film has become a profitable one for Dreamworks! <br/><br/>When all is said and done, this is an excellent film, with convincing acting and plausible directing!"

Extensive description of the condition here would potentially spoil this masterpiece for anyone who has not yet seen it, assuredly however, after watching it, no further explanation of the subject, explored through what is essentially a case study of the scientist John F Nash, seems necessary for an audience.<br/><br/>The film occasionally fringes on the strange, but masterfully never to a degree whereby the viewer's attention is lost.

I would recommend A Beautiful Mind as a study guide for psychology majors because it is a good discussion piece. This movie reminds me of a powerful drama based on a real life story that came out in 1977. The name of the movie was Sybil, directed by Daniel Petrie. A Beautiful Mind is about the human mind and inner conflict, it makes you think and want to know more about the mysteries of the human mind... John refused to allow his delusions to take control as he gained back control over his life. The delusions became powerless, but they stayed with him, always lurking, waiting and watching, in the shadows of his mind. In conclusion my overall appreciation for the film and the theme's importance to the film is how the story was portrayed; giving the viewers a real sense of what mental illness must have been like for John Nash. The film was entirely based on the concept of the power of the mind and how John became a prisoner of his own mind.<br/><br/>Looking out of the window of the mind: and working in the confines of his mind John live in two worlds: but one world only exists in his mind.

The film showed that in the mind of the beholder in this case, John Nash; the physical as well as the illusionary world could exist parallel to one another.

"bendipa","9","0","1","22 April 2005"," A beautiful snub?
","So much cinematic output of late consists of ""action/disaster"" movies aimed at cheap thrills by the second. And the more explosions, murders, special effects, fights or macho posing takes place, the better the audience seems to like it. The film, 'A Beautiful Mind' could not be more removed from the glut of superficial puerile trash that predominates our screens nowadays.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, who has exhibited more than his fair share of violent and aggressive behaviour on set, (and sometimes off set too) has made an exceptional movie, with ABM. Here he totally relinquishes his aggressive, stereotyped image, in favour of a mild, eccentric and awkward academic, totally absorbed in his field of mathematics. So convincingly does Crowe blend into the character of John Nash, that it's almost impossible to believe that it's him playing this role. He even looks different, having lost a bit of weight for the part, although the bulging biceps are ever present. His acting is just brilliant, and Crowe proves once and for all that he is leagues above most Hollywood actors, and need never be typecast for violent roles again, because he can be versatile in character.<br/><br/>Without going fully into the plot, the film basically is a two part study of schizophrenia, particularly from a victim's point of view. The first half of the film cleverly thrusts the audience right into the mind of John Nash, and the delusions he suffers. We share these delusions with him, and therefore they seem real enough in his mind (and ours) but baffling to everyone else around him. However, we are not really aware that Nash is actually a schizophrenic, until the film's second half. Up to then it's quite possible that Nash's growing alienation and secrecy about his work may have some genuine basis. There are at least three characters that the viewer is led to believe exist. One of them emerges near the start of the film, and unless you are extremely observant you would not realise he was fictitious, until all is revealed. We also notice Nash's lack of social skills, particularly with women, but despite this handicap he eventually manages to attract the attention of one his female students, destined to be his future wife Alicia, sympathetically played by Jennifer Connelly. The second half of the film deals with Nash's awareness of his condition, and his attempts to deal with it, and the strain it places on his marriage.<br/><br/>Crowe was more than ably supported by the rest of the cast. Jennifer Connelly received an Oscar, as did director Ron Howard. And the film received 'Best Picture' Oscar. But as for Russell Crowe? He was nominated but got nothing. It seems he was deliberately snubbed in 2002, since he received an Oscar the previous year in 'Gladiator'. That's life, I guess!<br/><br/>Films like ABM are far and few between. Maybe it's just as well since its welcoming quality reminds us how good films can still be, and that there are directors prepared to take a risk by not following the herd."

"Capability-Brown","7","0","1","22 April 2005"," Some interesting issues raised
","I enjoyed the film but thought that the makeup jobs could have done with a bit more work (especially Nash's wife at the end - how fake did that look?).<br/><br/>Something which I feel people have missed out on commenting on is the way that the secret agents are depicted. After reading Patrick Radden Keefe's book, ""Chatter"" the author gives an insight into the workings of the 'secret agencies' such as the NSA, CIA etc. The author goes on to tell us the difficulties of finding out information and that many people he interviews try to hide the fact that the workings of these agencies exist at all. It seems to gives 'us' an uncertainty as to whether we are being monitored, being surveyed on? by the outside world or is it just paranoia?<br/><br/>I like the way Beautiful mind shows Nash continually looking for threats, not being safe in the knowledge that he holds a secret.<br/><br/>But, although we find out that Nash is someone with a mental condition, i'm sure these worries do affect the 'real' people who work in the Cyrpto departments. It must be a challenge to keep things secret and not be able to comment on the line of their work with their family.<br/><br/>Beautiful mind raises these issues nicely which i'm sure, in reality, do exist for some.<br/><br/>The numbers are an interesting part of the film and for me as an art student it is interesting to see Nash go into cracking mode by filtering out the unwanted numbers and focusing on the connections between them."

","A Beautiful Mind covers the life of master mathematician John Nash starting with his tenure in college and ends with his winning of the Nobel Prize in 1994. I almost didn't watch the whole film, I'll admit. The beginning seemed a bit too slow to me and the story was almost on the brink of boring. So I just rewound it and put another flick in. I had no intention of watching it again because I didn't see what the big fuss was, except for Jennifer Connely. But after a while I decided to watch the whole movie all the way through. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Jennifer Connely and Russell Crowe turn in some truly outstanding performances. This movie was the first time that I saw Crowe in a movie and he did a brilliant job. Connely is always great(she was the real reason I decided to watch the film in the first place. Without giving too much away, John Nash suffers from some truly disturbing schizophrenic hallucinations.<br/><br/>He does some decoding work for the government and then afterwards thinks he's being followed by a guy in a suit and tie(played by Ed Harris in another of the film's outstanding performances), a roommate who moves in with him, and the roommate's niece. All of which are figments of his imagination. The hallucinations never leave him throughout his life, but he learns to deal with them, due in part to the patience and love that his wife(played by Connely) for him. She stood her ground and held out when a lot of wives would have thrown the deuces.<br/><br/>Amazing film. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT.<br/><br/>10/10"

","A Beautiful Mind was easily the picture of the year, and Ron Howard deserved the accolades he received. I don't understand why he is criticized by some as undeserving of the Oscar.<br/><br/>The one thing that will always perplex me is the fact that Russell Crowe was over-looked for the Acadamy Award for Best Actor. Not only did his acting carry this picture, without it, it probably wouldn't have been so well received. His ability to capture the essence of the person he is portraying (ie. his portrayal of Dr. Wigand in The Insider) is unbelievable.<br/><br/>To think that Denzel Washington won the Oscar for his portrayal of a ""bad"" cop in Training Day. Denzel is a great actor that I have a lot of respect for, but he shouldn't have been rewarded for this performance (he was better in Hurricane).<br/><br/>I can't even imagine what the Acadamy voters were thinking that year.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth the price of admission. It was also worth the purchase price. I get to enjoy it again and again."
"jasonempires","8","0","1","23 February 2005"," Good acting
","The most vital element of a film is the acting. Acting can make a film good or bad, especially for films in drama genre. ""A beautiful mind"" is a successful movie because of its fabulous acting. Russel Crowe acted as John Nash. His performance was excellent because he became the character. He shaped the characteristics, behavior and tragedy of John successfully through out the film. In the film, John is a pure genius who can solve problems that baffle most of the mathematicians. There is one scene in the university canteen where he discovers an essential idea of his 'Game Theory'. He brings the audiences into his world of mind with complicated thoughts and ideas. As I was watching the film, I could understand how brilliant that John is. But it does not mean that he is perfect. This arrogant young man faced the problem of schizophrenia. Russell Crowe performed as an insane person. John's life is tragic. I could feel the bitter he has tasted in his lifetime struggle, though he fends off his fate late in his life. After countless bitter, his contribution has been approved. I am relieved and I am proud of John. Jennifer Connelly acted as Alicia Nash. She shows mercy and love to John who is having a journey of self-discovery. For the most impressive part, I should mention the time when John disappoints Alicia again because of his failure to defeat his weakness. However, Alicia does not give up John. She grabbed his tightly and put it softly onto her chest. She also put her hand on his chest to show how deep she likes John and says, 'this is real' to bring him back to reality. Really touching."
"faded_Glory","7","0","1","22 February 2005"," Good in parts
","I am in two minds about this one (sorry folks!). On the plus side, the way the movie depicts the mind of John Nash from his perspective is very good. I hadn't actually heard all that much about this film before I saw it, so I must be one of the few who didn't know for sure that Nash is indeed hallucinating until the scenes with the empty barn behind his house (Have you hearrrd the storrry of the Empty Barrrrn..). I am probably thick, but to maintain the uncertainty as to what is real and what is not until that far into the film is very strong, and really rams home what schizophrenia can be to those who suffer from it. Until that point, the film might have been just as well a political thriller instead of a psychological drama. Great, but it works only once, of course.<br/><br/>On the minus side, the romance between Nash and Alicia is quite unbelievable. I don't mean later in the film when she is his wife and stays with him through his illness, regardless of his own suffering. This I can believe, there are many people so dedicated to their partner that they sacrifice big chunks of their own life and happiness to stay together when there is trouble. No, the silly bit is their courtship. If this is really how it happened in real life she is even more crazy than he is. Why would a girl respond to a total boor and social misfit like him? The guy is simply revolting, and I would think that an intelligent and pretty girl like Alicia would have no lack of better suitors from which to choose from.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's acting is reasonably good, if a bit on the side of overdoing it. He is best when he is under the medication, worst in his college days with the exaggerated spasms and speech problems. Good to see Christopher Plummer making an appearance, and he puts Dr. Rosen down very precisely, keeping enough distance to make it unclear for a while who he really is and what he really stands for.<br/><br/>The cinematography is quite beautiful, I like the warm colours of the University surroundings, so suggestive of steadiness, calm and control, contrasting nicely with the turmoil of Nash's inner life. <br/><br/>The ending with the Nobel prize acceptance speech is downright cheesy and disappointed me. This film doesn't need such cheap trickery to make its point.<br/><br/>On the whole, well worth watching but parts of it are a bit too Hollywood."
"segacs","8","0","1","5 February 2005"," What is reality?
","This is a superb movie that is both a pleasure to watch and a lot of fun to contemplate afterwards.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind tells the story of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who also happens to be schizophrenic. Those of you who have taken introductory microeconomics might remember vaguely something about Nash Equilibrium (it took me two thirds of the movie to make the connection) but that's hardly important. The movie stays away from the math for the most part, preferring to focus on how Nash saw the world as opposed to what he did. Although at two and a half hours, the movie is relatively long, I honestly didn't notice until I left the theatre and checked my watch. I was astonished to see that so much time had passed because the movie kept me captivated.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's performance was nothing short of extraordinary. Jennifer Connelly was fine in her role, as were many of the supporting actors, but none particularly stood out compared to Crowe.<br/><br/>Where this movie truly stood out, however, was where it forced audiences to question how we define reality. What exactly is real? What isn't? Is seeing believing? Does reality exist only in the mind? A Beautiful Mind has been criticized for turning fact into fiction and taking broad liberties from the true life of John Nash. This may very well be true. As an autobiography, it likely falls far short of factual. However, it has considerable artistic merit in its own right, fact or no fact. After all, what is truth? The movie also glosses over some things that could have been further developed, such as Nash's struggle to overcome his illness. Plus, his relationship with wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) comes off as fairly implausible. She is too supportive; he never gives anything to the relationship, even at first. And the ending comes off a wee bit too sentimental for my taste.<br/><br/>Bottom line, though? Go see this movie. It is brilliant and definitely worth the watch."
"miken-3","8","0","2","24 January 2005"," Great!
","Highly riveting film with a super performance by both Russell Crowe and Ed Harris. Even though the director changed John Nash's life a great deal to make it a more entertaining movie. John Nash, a genius who came up with a business model that was adopted by many businesses, is a social oddball that is so dedicated to his studies that he has absolutely no concept of social skills. He finds it a task to even make the slightest bit of conversation with a female. The only person he seems to get along with is his college roommate (later we find out that this roommate is not what he seems). His genius attracts a government agency that employs him briefly as a code breaker. There he meets Ed Harris, who is not what he seems either. Ed has him working on top secret work that involves breaking secret transmissions from the Russians.<br/><br/>Everything then starts to unravel and we learn the truth about the people that seem to influence John the most.<br/><br/>Crowe gives a super performance in probably the role he was born to play!"

","A Beautiful Delusion<br/><br/>There is no point in being nuts if you can't have fun. (Mathematician John Nash in A Beautiful Mind)<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a biographical film starring Russell Crowe as mathematician John Nash, who suffered from schizophrenia long enough to become familiar enough with his demons to finally recognize them as such. That is a victory worth celebrating, and the movie does so, eloquently.<br/><br/>Some critics of A Beautiful Mind compared it to Sylvia Nasar's 450-page biography of the same title, and said it did not faithfully portray the complexity of either Nash's life or his disease. That's asking a lot of a two hour movie. <br/><br/>No, Nash did not have the visual hallucinations portrayed in the movie. And yes, the movie came nowhere near Nash's belief that he was receiving messages from outer-space aliens, calling him to found a world government. But the film did make Nash's delusions credible to the viewer. <br/><br/>""The prodigal roommate appears"" says Charles, arriving in Nash's grad-student life with a hangover. Charles is played admirably by Paul Bettany (later the ship's surgeon in Master and Commander). And, unless you are symptom-hunting from the get-go, Charles will be as real to you as he is to Nash. Only later will you see him as the flip-side of Nash's asocial personality, created by his imagination out of a very human need for companionship and love. <br/><br/>And that is the way delusions really are. From long and bitter experience I know: Psychosis sneaks up on you hypnotically, like a blacksnake moving by imperceptible increments toward the creature it suddenly devours. <br/><br/>Like Charles, and like the cartoon G-man Parcher (played by Ed Harris) who replaces him, delusions offer excitement. As the recovering Nash says wryly, ""There is no point in being nuts when you can't have fun."" And they're charming. They know how much more important you are than others realize, how central in significance.<br/><br/>As a film, Beautiful Mind merited four Acadamy Awards. But for those of us who have suffered from mental illness its finest accomplishment is that it did not romanticize mental illness, as many movies do, nor attribute the disease to that movie clichÃ©, the Horrible Repressed Trauma. Rather, it revealed what psychosis is like from the inside, and that also is a victory worth celebrating.<br/><br/>Tom McClellan +++"

","As I have seen on the comments a lot of you really haven't got the point of the movie, this isn't based on whether his theories, solutions etc. were right as some of you think. What's the title of the movie? A Beautiful Mind, not The Truth of Mathematics, it's a movie letting us know how the mind of some perosn such as John Narsh or whatever his name is, giving us in details his life from beginning and end of how much mathematics influenced and not just that but his job and most of all his wife Alicia. Before I watched the whole movie I wasn't interested, I saw parts and it seemed real boring and not good enough for me. But the first 20 minutes of the movie made me think about whether I should pause it and get a drink or just watch the whole movie and then get a drink because the storyline was so good and so interesting. Anyone that would like to watch this movie I recommend it a lot it sends a very good messege to everyone."

","I thoroughly enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. In fact, I would recommend it to anyone, and I often do. But to say this is based on John Nash's life in any way other than the most remote doesn't stack up. The seemingly endless onslaught of love and support put forth by Alicia to present an eloquent story is just that, a story, with no truth to it. They made no mention to the fact that she divorced him almost 30 years prior to his winning of the Nobel Prize. Granted, she did eventually go back to him (they were remarried in 2001, 7 years after the Nobel Prize), but to portray her the way they did is just plain bad form. If you are going to say a movie is based on reality, make it somewhat realistic. Like I said, great movie, horrible portrayal of what REALLY happened."

","Ron Howard continues to impress and surprise. Russell Crowe is, to my way of thinking, the finest screen actor before us at the moment, possessing a range of versatility unknown by any other male ""star"" of the day. Comparing his portrayal here with his other work, notably 'Master and Commander' and 'Gladiator' it is astonishing to believe one man can encompass so successfully such a wide variety of roles within such a short span of years.<br/><br/>Unlike the current crop of bio-historical cow flop like 'Troy' and 'Alexander' Ron Howard's fascinating journey along the razor's edge between madness and genius proves that good cinema need not involve gratuitous violence, sex or profanity, not that those things in and of themselves cannot add to a film's relevancy, but they usually don't.<br/><br/>The entire cast is excellent, notably Jennifer Connelly's magnetic performance as the mad professor's long-suffering and loyal wife. She embodies the ""love conquers all"" message of the movie in a way that is never saccharine or mawkish.<br/><br/>This movie is a very good mystery for the first time viewer. Further viewings uncover more depth in the story which is always a sign of good craftsmanship on the part of the script writer, director and actors.<br/><br/>The technical aspects never intrude on the action (please note this Bertolucci!) and the story flows naturally from start to finish without a hiccup.<br/><br/>It is gratifying to see that a Hollywood production can have some depth to it without resorting to coy sexuality and meaningless vulgarity.<br/><br/>I don't buy many dvds but this one is a keeper."

","At first I had my reservations about this movie. I never liked mathematics at school, so why should I watch a movie with a mathematician as the main character in it? Well, it may not have convinced me of the use of mathematics, but at least it convinced me that maths is able to drive you crazy (as if I didn't already know that for years).<br/><br/>No, serious now. It sure may seem a very boring movie and I'm not the kind of person that wants to see all bio-pics that have ever been made, but this time I was really surprised by it. I found it really intriguing to see how the schizophrenia took over the man's life. It was fascinating, yet also uncomfortable to see. This may well be the strongest as well as the weakest point of this movie. The strongest point because it gives you something to think about, the weakest because it seems to me (after reading some comments on this website) not many people still feel the urge to think while watching a movie. If there aren't any big explosions, guns and special effects to be seen, they are no longer interested in it. <br/><br/>Personally I liked the movie very much. Russel Crowe did a great job as Dr. Nash, but the other actors' performances weren't any less. All in all I would recommend this movie to anybody who isn't afraid to use his mind for a few moments during a movie and who doesn't need any special effects in a movie before believing it was a good one. I give it a 9/10."
"raymond-15","8","0","2","8 November 2004"," Excellent portrayal of a deranged mind.
","A beautiful mind, a lonely mind, a tormented mind, a frightened mind, a rebellious mind....Russell Crowe portrays in vivid yet controlled detail the degeneration of a mind in turmoil....a sick mind overcome with schizophrenia. Fidgety mannerisms are not pleasant to watch and they grow in number as the malady takes hold. Imagined presence of colleagues at the University where he teaches mathematics and imagined conversations with them suggest that his brain is playing tricks with him. A top psychiatrist called in to examine him confirms his schizophrenia. After undergoing the bizarre shock treatment, the mathematician goes on a course of medication with little promise of cure.<br/><br/>The intriguing part of this film is the confusion arising between real characters and imagined characters. This is intentional for we are seeing life through the eyes of a man suffering terribly from mental illness. It is disturbing to watch, yet fascinating. It makes you feel uncomfortable. Watch closely and you will see patterns on a window pane and patterns of shadows across a flight of steps and patterns taking shape in a jumble of letters of coded text. It is almost as if the mind is too active. And lurking in the shadowy background there is always a threatening figure watching him...or is he just imagined? Trying to reason with such an afflicted person is almost impossible. Much of the mental agony is suffered by persons close to him. Just imagine how difficult it must be to live with a person who can scarcely differentiate between what is real and what is imagined. Here is a man who does not believe in luck but who believes that everything can be explained by some mathematical equation. In life he says there are many equations to be solved, but adds the most mysterious of all is the equation of love. In the hands of the make-up artists Russell Crowe makes a wonderful and absolutely believable Mr. John Nash. Indeed his whole portrayal of Mr. Nash's life is most creditable and truly worthy of an Academy Award."

Russel Crowe's acting nearly puts a tear in your eye because you actually feel for him in certain situations. Superb on Crowe's part. What prevents this movie from being anything higher than 7 is the fact that the majority of the audience will think its a yawnfest, kudos to you if you are a patient person.

"misteme2003","9","0","1","24 October 2004"," Mind boggling, a beautiful film, sad yet poignant *?SPOILERS*
","After watching Russell Crowe in ""Gladiator"" who would've thought he'd appear in another fantastic film and perform yet again as the immensely talented actor that he is. This drama has a complex story line, but it's a complex topic, so expect nothing less than a complex movie. Mind boggling to say the least. This movie is a love story, a story of a triumph over one of the least talked about diseases around; mental illness. Ron Howard takes us into the mind of a schizophrenic and he does it so beautifully, so tenderly. Aside from the story of one man's life, Mr. Howard brings the sadness and misfortune of a terrible disease into our minds as we are shown the mind of one of it's victims, John Nash. It's an extraordinary story of an extraordinary man, with an extraordinary life. <br/><br/>It begins with John Nash entering into Princeton's graduate program and we are given a peek into his ""brilliant"" mind...and slowly into his illness. Of course, with dramatic license we are told of a great love story, but I wonder of the truthfulness of that part (Mr. and Mrs. Nash were divorced for some years and remarried a few years before the movie was made, not as the movie portrayed) but, for the purpose of the movie we are not angry for the minor alterations of reality.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is so good in this we almost believe he is real as Parcher, a character that only exists in John's mind. As is Paul Bettany, Nash's ""roommate"" and ""friend""..while we are watching we are unsure and fooled into thinking their roles are that of actual men, when they are not. Thank Ron Howard for that. I later read that there are clues to show us before the viewer is made aware of it...for instance...when Charles' niece is playing in the field with the birds, running around, the birds don't fly away, hence she is not real...also, Charles is not seen at Nash's wedding and while we may wonder why, we aren't sure at that point why. <br/><br/>Also, there is some truth to the fact of John Nash working for the government, we just don't know to what extent. In the movie, there is a fine line between what the viewer is shown to be real and imagined. That's what makes it so good, so artistically crafted. A creative scene in which we see Russell Crowe called to a top secret room to decipher ""messages"" with the montage of computerized numbers is perfect. It's as if he's spinning out of control. Or perhaps a glimpse into his brilliant yet affected mind. <br/><br/>There are many poignant moments in the film. To name a couple; when Nash's rival allows him to take office at Princeton while fully aware of his illness. He shows compassion we should all have for the mentally ill. Also, when he receives the pens in the tea room, we see that he is recognized for his work and not shunned because of his condition. <br/><br/>A beautiful Mind is a beautiful story with few flaws (one I feel I should mention is Crowe's accent, it could have been better..not that I could do better but it sounded off) <br/><br/>This is another movie that will not be forgotten and will go down in film history books. Not only for the talent of those involved in making it, but for it's contribution to awareness of an ugly, ignored disease that affects so many...this is one you've got to see, even own (the DVD, of course for the special features) I give it 9/10*"
"vchimpanzee","Null","0","2","12 September 2004"," Brilliant job, especially by Crowe
","I saw a Russell Crowe movie this afternoon (one that he'd probably like to forget) and was reminded I never got around to commenting on this stellar work of art. I wouldn't know Crowe from Adam, but that helped because he BECAME the character John Nash for me. This might have been harder with an actor who was familiar to me.<br/><br/>I can identify with a man who was intelligent but had trouble fitting in socially in college. I was not brilliant and could have never achieved all that he did, but I have some understanding of this man's character. I thought the actor playing John's college roommate did a great job--especially later. And his little girl was adorable. Jennifer Connolly showed a lot of determination as Nash's wife, who had to deal with more than many spouses who give up. But she didn't.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>But I found this movie very strange. I had heard that this was a man who had schizophrenia, but he seemed fairly normal. Anyone would be driven crazy by the type of work Nash was doing for the government, by the paranoia that resulted from the Soviet attempts to dominate the world, and our need to be ever vigilant. He had to see everything--and I mean everything--that could possibly indicate an attack was coming. Who wouldn't go crazy, with all this information to analyze and the remarkable ability to see patterns in everything? Only ... IT WASN'T TRUE. I was very surprised to learn the secret government work was his imagination, and that he never had a roommate.

The twist and photography were gracefully written in this masterpiece along with the stunning acting from all over, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connolly, and Josh Lucas. Year 2001 was the biggest Oscar mistake in history, Best Actor went to Denzel Washington in 'Training Day' which was good; though not nearly as deserved as Russell Crowe. The trauma that John Nash went through was horrible and disturbing as all shown in 'A Beautiful Mind'.<br/><br/>THIS IS A MUST SEE PERFECT MOVIE..............."

I was sick of the hype surrounding his ridiculously over-praised ""Gladiator"" movie and not seeing this movie would be my revenge!  But, as luck would have it, it was on Canadian TV the other night... unedited (broadcast TV in Canada is soooooo cool)... and I figured maybe it was time.  Well, the movie started to lose me at first... it started out a little too predictable and then took a few implausible turns. Just as I was about to give up on it... some major plot developments had me looking at the movie with new eyes.  By the midway point, the movie had me hooked.  Not a perfect movie though... Crowe's performance does seem a little too ""act-y"" at times... and Jennifer Connelly is... well, she does the same thing she does in all her movies... some people seem to like it... me, not so much.  Once again, Ron Howard takes a movie subject that I find somewhat less than compelling (what? another eccentric genius who becomes a beloved teacher?) and turns it into a fine film."

Throughout the film, John can be seen looking at a glass or strings of numbers, and then we see some of them highlighted to show that John sees these patterns, where no one else sees them. I found it a simple yet unique way to show how this complex thought process works. In a sense, we get to see through the eyes of a genius.<br/><br/>If you are intrigued as to how the mind operates, and you are looking for a film that does not have two-dimensional characters, this has to be a film on your short list of ""instant classics"".

"wileyw1","Null","0","1","10 July 2004"," SPOILER - Deciphering the secret codes of reality
","**CONTAINS SPOILER**<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" is based on a true story about John Nash, a genius mathematician who is intellectually brilliant, but socially challenged. The movie begins with Nash's entrance into Princeton, and spans most of his remaining life. Nash's complicated relationships are both uncommon and heart-warming. At the same time, Nash's decoding assignments for the government during the war and his incredible challenges thereafter are thrilling and full of unexpected twists. <br/><br/>Some of the unexpected twists support the movie's theme that distinguishing between fantasy and reality can sometimes be difficult. For most of the movie, director Ron Howard shows the action through the eyes of John Nash, superbly portrayed by Russell Crowe. The mystery and double-life that Nash must lead due to his top-secret government work with his agency-associate Parcher (Ed Harris) help further the reality-distorting theme. Nash's wife, Alicia, portrayed by Jennifer Connelly in an academy-award-winning performance, has to sort through the top-secret information to figure out what is real ans what isn't.<br/><br/>Director Howard uses low-key lighting to emphasize Nash's point of view regarding his government-conspiracy theory. In a mob-like car chase down dark alleys with only the streetlights and car lights shining, Howard builds the suspense and pulls the audience into Nash's paranoia. Another technique that Howard uses to demonstrate Nash's point of view is animation. Several times, animation that has been layered on top of live action brings alpha and numeric characters to life as Nash analyzes lines of seemingly nonsensical data for a code.<br/><br/>Just as deciphering the secret codes seems insurmountable for John Nash's observers, distinguishing between what is imagined and what is tangible can be extraordinarily difficult for some people as well. To demonstrate this, Ron Howard uses some of the same story-telling strategies that director M. Night Shyamalan uses in ""The Sixth Sense."" Shyamalan shows Bruce Willis' character, a depressed psychologist, through the extraordinary point of view of a gifted young spirit-seer, Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. By convincing the audience that Willis is portraying a normal therapist in Sear's daily life, there is a definite confusion between what is real and what isn't. Similarly, without seeing and hearing Nash's daily interactions with his personal phantoms, creating an audience appreciation for the obstacles that John Nash overcomes would have been impossible. Indeed, at the end of this film, Howard has made it clear that sorting out reality from fantasy can be difficult."
"CurtMan@LVCM.com","10","0","2","3 June 2004"," Beautiful EVERYTHING in this beautiful film
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""A Beautiful Mind"" ranks as one of the best films I have ever had the privilege to understand, a monumental achievement on multiple levels in film. To begin with, the performance of Russell Crowe as the troubled, delusional mathematician John Nash borders on sheer perfection- astute, collaborative (of Nash's estrangement with the world), and potent; Crowe constructs a character so veritable and bewildering that you always marvel his genius and symphathize with his illness. The film chronicles a brilliant, yet socially flawed, mathematician. Nash dissociates with the world, dismissing the company of others for sketching and calculating curious situational equations----on his dormatory window. Struggling with ""books, classes"", Nash finally emerges as a gifted mathematician with a law for governing dynamics, and succeeds from Princton to Wheeler Labs at M.I.T. Assigned by ""Big Brother"" to investigate potential communist coding in various publications, Nash is soon propelled into a dizzying world of fright, turmoil, and delusion, as his accomplished genius is almost obliterated by mental illness. The film focuses intensely on Nash's battle with schizophrenia, with brilliant direction, beautiful music, and potent,engrossing dialogue. The second standout performance here is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly, who compassionately plays Nash's wife, Alicia, supporting the film whenever we lack to understand Nash and his trauma. The film succeeds in its story of a mathematician plagued by schizophrenia with realism and empathy. Every instrument of constructing this story is suitable, if not excellent. Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" delivers the most beautiful potency in its success of engrossing us with John Nash, the most important genius of his time, and detailing his truly, bizarrely, remarkable life. **** out of ****"
"Luluhalabaloo","Null","0","1","30 May 2004"," Exceptional acting, VERY important movie
","John Nash the man had more to hide than the move projected, but that's forgivable because it's a movie and it has a time limit. The descent into the hell that Nash lived with is well articulated, providing a sense of the disorientation that people with mental illness must feel. The movie looks good and gives a sense of time and movement, very much in line with a mathematics subject. <br/><br/>But the amazing grace of this whole project is Russell Crowe. He was spectacular as Nash; vivid, intense, and true. His inability to meet the eyes of others particularly at the beginning was very realistic, as was the inability to carry on appropriate social interactions. One can see high-functioning autism in these actions (Asperger's Syndrome), and personally were very rewarding to watch as I recognized and felt vindicated in observing these behaviors in such an intelligent man. While AS doesn't normally lead to schizophrenia, many geniuses tend to have autistic behaviour patterns or social skills issues which supports the age-old presumption that genius and eccentricity go hand in hand. And many with AS are incredibly brilliant and very highly focused which makes them strong intellectuals. In general, Nash's behaviour was portrayed as eccentric at best and Crowe's treatment of the eccentricity and eventual schizophrenia was remarkable.<br/><br/>Some lines were very illuminating such as when 'Nash' says that he shuns books and teachers because he wants to be original in his thought. This is not as uncommon an approach as one would think for talented individuals; the fear of adopting another's thought or attitude can be stifling to a creative, original process. Unfortunately, that was almost all I learned intellectually from the film aside from Nash's approach to out think his disease. <br/><br/>I love Ron Howard for doing this film, and Russell Crowe made Nash seem almost too sexy for his shirt, but I loved every minute of it. It needs to be viewed more than once as there is much to notice: his writing on glass (transparency), his infinity signs, his web, his patterns, his thinking in pictures which is very Asperger's/autistic, even his relationship with Alicia which once again supports the lack of social skills. What we 'normal' folk take for granted, those with socialization issues grapple with daily and they should be respected as humans and not made fun of. Children with socialization issues are mercilessly teased and ridiculed and hence hurt as Nash was as a child. All of us need to teach our children to recognize and respect those lacking in social skills. This is a great great movie to sensitize ourselves to all those with social skills issues not necessarily as profound as schizophrenia but apparent, and to teach our children to recognize and respect other children with socialization issues."

Okay, that's that.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ALERT *** (Stop reading now if you haven't seen the film)<br/><br/>I had a rough idea of the plot:  a brilliant mathematician is brought down by schizophrenia.  This had a special meaning to me, because I once heard a presentation by a man (let's call him Fred) who conquered his schizophrenia using the power of logic.  Doctors told him it was impossible, and this is precisely what Doctor Rosen tells Nash.  They may be right in most cases ... but not always.  Nash did it, and so did Fred.<br/><br/>Yet I didn't truly understand Fred's accomplishment until I was slapped in the face by this movie.  When Doctor Rosen reflects on what it's like to find out that people you know never even existed, I was struck hard by the brutality of the notion.  From that point onwards in the film, I kept wondering, ""What if you had to doubt absolutely everything?""<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the way that we're given hints that certain elements are delusion.  My first big clue was the digital readout embedded in Nash's arm. It was an huge anachronism on the heels of some other less stark anachronisms.  From that point onwards, I started wondering if Parcher was real, but I couldn't see how that was possible.  And because  I couldn't resolve the matter in a tidy way, I obtained a faint inkling of what Nash's affliction was like.<br/><br/>One scene that hit me hard was when Nash passes Charles' little girl on the steps after telling her he couldn't talk to her again.  She holds open her arms for a hug, and he has to keep going.  In that moment, I saw how tempting it could be to slide into the delusion.  He also has to turn his back on the ideal buddy, and his Duty To Save The World!<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I've only got 1000 characters.

I was stunned by the plot twist. I have never been so taken in by a story with a plot twist than this film.

The fact that every one and everything is perfect, shows that his deepest desire was to be perfect. It shows the simple and less appealing things, because these are the things mattered to him.  It also shows how powerful this disease is.  John Nash, whether he cheated on his wife or not, was still an amazing person.  This is why this story is an award winner, not because it was made for the movies, but because in telling it it captures the aspects of a sickness.

","A BEAUTIFUL MIND is an extremely odd film.  On the surface it is the standard this-happened-that-happened biopic, the subject being a Nobel-winning mathematician named John Nash. But by the end of the film, instead of feeling you have learned about the man, the viewer is apt to understand him even less. <br/><br/>The facts in the film are, at best shaky in the way all movie biographies play fast and loose with reality just to squeeze a man's life into two hours of screen time. Plus, questions arose after the film's release regarding embarrassing facts about the man that were left out, for one reason or another. But the biggest distraction is how the film blurs reality to somehow duplicate the man's own schizophrenia.  <br/><br/>This is a film that tells a a story based on facts, takes dramatic license with facts, supposedly obscures the facts and makes up ""facts"" that aren't reality to anyone accept one character within the film. What is real life, reel life and surreal life may not ever be really clear. On the one hand, I admire how director Ron Howard does a ""Twilight Zone"" number on the audience, leading us to accept one thing only to slap us in the face with a new reality later. I don't necessarily think he goes far enough in exploring the plot possibilities. Nash's mental problems liberates Howard to try some daring stuff, but the reality that Nash is a living, breathing individual ropes him back in. The film might have been better (and oddly, more honest) had the whole story been fictional from page one of the screenplay.<br/><br/>
Like Nash, the film finds a way of freeing itself of the boundaries that reality sets, unlike Nash, the film might have been better not totally regaining those boundaries. As is, the film is a solid enough piece of filmmaking: well acted and skillfully dishonest with the viewer. <br/><br/>
But the best thing about A BEAUTIFUL MIND is Russell Crowe's nuanced performance. Even without the delusional gimmickry, his performance following Nash's life from youth to old age is satisfying. The irony is that Crowe's performance is what lifts the film up above the ordinary, yet when Oscar time came around, he was overlooked and all the other major players were rewarded. Crowe was the real thing; all else was illusion. At the Oscars, the illusion won."

"gordoglo","7","0","1","8 March 2004"," A little silly
","*MAJOR, DEVASTATING SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" is well-acted and reasonably entertaining, but pretty silly as well.  The concept is interesting -- to show us the fascinating evolution of genius, then sort of pull the rug out from under us and show us what happens when a devastating mental illness is brought to bear on the workings of such genius.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is the way in which the rug was pulled. Normally, when you have such a plot twist (a la The Sixth Sense), you can re-watch the movie and say, ""Oh yeah, it all makes sense now.""  But with this piece of cinema, there's no way you could go back to the pre-diagnosis parts of the film and say, Oh yeah, they thought he was crazy.  There isn't a single shot of someone looking at him oddly when he is talking to this imaginary roommate or fictionalized military man.  IN FACT, the movie even flashes ""The Pentagon"" -- and this early in the film, why would you even question it's NOT the Pentagon?  So we are either supposed to believe THAT really happened and his mind created this new character based on that experience, or (more likely, since later they imply the government would have no use for him), he made up that whole incident.  So I feel like the movie deliberately misled me, rather than allow me to lead myself down a wrong path.  That's kind of shameful, especially because post-diagnosis they made such a point of showing how this stuff was really fake.<br/><br/>The silliest part of the way this movie treated the whole twist was when he was finally captured and taken to the hospital.  The men from the asylum just HAPPEN to be dressed up in the same style as the people in his dreams, and think the best place to take him into custody is while he's giving a lecture at the most prestigious university in the country.  Right.  Then, when they finally nab him, as he's screaming for help and being injected, everyone just stands around watching it and accepting it as if to say, ""Well, this looks really wrong, but I guess they know what they're doing.""<br/><br/>I would also love to know who called these authorities.  His wife had to be convinced of his malady, and apparently his associates, who had something of a clue of his weirdness, didn't worry enough to alert his wife, which I would think would be at least step one before you phone the men in suits.<br/><br/>If you aren't such a stickler for detail, though, it's easy to be entertained by this.  Another fine performance from Russell Crowe and some stunning-in-spots scenes from Jennifer Connelly (haven't decided yet though whether she deserved that Oscar).<br/><br/>7/10"

","Again, I have to write to whole-heartedly disagree with what others have said about this film. It is brilliant. Of course it doesn't completely get the whole story right, but Hollywood is not about 100% autobiographical pix. Watch E! True Hollywood Story for that. But it does do an amazing job of capturing the mood and madness of schizophrenia. The photography is brilliant, the directing subperb, and, while I wasn't a real fan of Russel Crowe before seeing this film, I don't think anyone could have done a better job of interpretting a man confused by his own genius. And it is that genuis that ultimately nearly destroys him. It raised interesting points for me, namely that geniuses see the world altogether differently than the rest of us. And so do those suffering from mental illness. And, in a way, aren't these two qualities in a person really the same thing?<br/><br/>
I never saw the pace of this film as slow, and I was thoroughly captured from the very beginning. I DID find the Jennifer Connelly character and storyline rather unbelievable, and was shocked to hear that she won for best supporting actress. Russell Crowe desrved it much more - probably one of the more challenging roles in the last 5 years for any actor, and he pulled it off flawlessly.<br/><br/>Don't miss this film. A chilling but ultimately heartwarming and unconventional story that is full of everything - action, plot twists, nostalgia, espionage, romance, and human frailty.<br/><br/>9 of 10"

"pendennis","Null","0","1","1 February 2004"," Fighting the demons
","Having read many of the comments on this movie, I agree that it does have its warts.  However, these in no way, detract from the job that Russell Crowe and Ron Howard do in depicting the world in which a schizophrenic, such as John Nash lives and copes.  I had to ask myself, ""How I would portray the world of John Nash?""  Since I've never been there, I accept Ron Howard's magnificent interpretation of depicting the demons John Nash fought all these years.  How else does a director depict the downward-spiraling world of the untreated schizophrenic?  The highs (Herman), and the lows (Parcher) must be depicted this way to give the audience some reference point.  We can't possibly understand his vision, since the majority of us do not suffer from schizophrenia.<br/><br/>In our modern world we can't grasp the concept for treatment of mental illness in the 1950's.  Medicine has come a long way since insulin and electric shock treatments, and lobotomies.  While true that John Nash has had a number of problems not dealt with in the film, this was not a mini-series.  Ron Howard could only deal with a limited treatment of John Nash's story, and some artistic license needs to be applied.<br/><br/>As with any heroic epic, the title character must have a chance at redemption after losing nearly everything.  And make no mistake - this struggle is as heroic as anyone can make.  Besides, don't we all have our Charles Hermans and William Parchers to some extent?  Russell Crowe does a superb job of depicting that struggle.  Think honestly and admit that you've stared at a person who shows outward signs of mental illness; that you've looked on in some disbelief at a person who suffered a grand mal epileptic seizure; or that the little eccentricities people display you find humorous. The geniuses among us are replete with those eccentricities.  Thank goodness they are here and have them!<br/><br/>A 9+ out of 10."

","**********************SPOLIERS****************** I had to right this paper for school about Schizophrenia and since i love this site i decided to submit. The movie, A Beautiful Mind, deals with the difficulty of living with schizophrenia. John Nash is a schizophrenic who attends Princeton University and is able to solve math problems that baffle even the greatest minds. Right from the beginning we noticed that social interaction is extremely tough for John. When John has to make conversation with other people we realize some of the first symptoms with his disorganized speech and disorganized thoughts and behavior. Throughout the movie we continue to notice he has much difficulty talk with others except when with one person. When John is with his `roommate' Charles we notice that all trouble talking and thinking is eliminated. From there we might understand that Charles isn't real and just a figment of the imagination. Later on when schizophrenic images have driven John to the edge Dr. Rosen confronts him at a math speech John is giving. Dr. Rosen gives John shock therapy and we see John having convulsions while strapped down on a medical bed. Besides the shock therapy Rosen also gives John a heavy dose of medicine and asks Alicia Nash, John's wife, to watch out for him. Dr. Rosen also has to face the hardest part of telling John that people he thinks he knows are not real. John has a tough time getting a grip on reality and sometimes can't even turn to his wife. During a schizophrenic episode while attempting to knock away `William Parcher's gun' pointed to his wife but instead hits his wife. This and John's forgetfulness with his baby so how hard it can be to care for someone with schizophrenia. With these two episodes Alicia even has to move out until John can understand what is real and what is not. A moment occurs when John comes to grips with reality with himself and tells Alicia that he knows that the images are not real. He says that Becky never got any older the images are not real. From this point we know John we fight these illusions until he is `better.' During the movie we become attached to his illusions and just as it is for John it is tough for us to let them go. Near the end John tells us when he is asked if the illusions are still there, he says that they are never gone I just don't answer them. Unfortunately at this time that's all that could be done. In the end John has triumphed in the biggest way, he has put the images out of his mind and wins the Nobel Peace prize. He then gives an emotional speech crediting everything that he has done to his wife, and rightfully so. What makes this so much more realistic is that it is."

","Ron Howard admirably put together 2001's Bet Picture `A Beautiful Mind,' the story of Professor John Nash's battle against his schizophrenia.

This fact, along with my general dislike of Russell Crowe had me avoiding this Oscar winner for a while.<br/><br/>With all of my personal baggage now set aside, I must admit I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would, and even more surprisingly, I found the best part of the film to be Crowe's convincing portrayal of Nash. The depth and talent that must be utilized in order to convincingly portray mental illness must be staggering. Jennifer Connelly (`Pollock') deservedly earned her Oscar for her heart-felt depiction of Nash's wife, Alicia. The other actor that warrants mentioning is the always brilliant Ed Harris (`Pollock,' `Apollo 13,' `Nixon.') Is it just me or do others feel that if Ed Harris starred in a remake of `Plan 9 from Outer Space' it would warrant Oscar consideration? The man is an amazing talent.<br/><br/>The area of this project that seems the most beautiful to me is the combination of Howard's direction, Roger Deakin's (`O' Brother Where Art Thou' `Fargo' `Kundun')cinematography and the editing of Dan Hanley and Michael Hill (editing team on `Apollo 13' and `Backdraft'). The way that this film depicts the inner workings of Nash's mathematical and schizophrenia is wonderfully done."

","A Beautiful Mind is based on Sylvia Nasar's 1998 biography of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr., but it is not another biography on film.  The film states before the credits roll, ""....The Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr. still teaches at Princeton, and walks to campus every day..."" but it leaves out facts that would have made Nash more human and vulnerable, like his being a bisexual in his 20s, his having sired his first child by a mistress, Alicia's divorcing him and their subsequent remarriage, etc. The Nash that comes out of this carefully recrafted biography is a romanticized figure arousing sympathy, an awe-inspiring victim-turned-victor; in short, a hero. But never mind.  One shouldn't expect moviemakers to gamble millions of dollars on an honest portrayal of one man's life, even if he were a genius who has been compared to Darwin, Mendel and Newton.  Let's just look at A Beautiful Mind, the movie, and size up Crowe instead of judging Nash. Crowe does a superb job of playing this tormented paranoid of a genius: his odd gestures, facial twitches, erratic glances, loping walk and his convulsions under insulin shock therapy all combine to wow the viewer anew with Crowe's acting prowess-especially when you recall the picture of invincibility and immortality the actor projected as the (Oscar-winning) hero in The Gladiator.   Indeed, it is Crowe who carries the movie from beginning to end, ably spurred by fine co-actors. That A Beautiful Mind won the Best Picture in the recent Golden Globe Awards-with Crowe as Best Actor and Connelly as Best Supporting Actress-is saying much about the technical excellence of the film.<br/><br/>Families with older teen children may pick up a thing or two about the power of love and faith in A Beautiful Mind. Mental illness in the movies is usually shown as sensational, pathetic, perverse, laughable or grotesque. In this movie, mental illness is just a disease that stands in the way of a happy marriage-a cross to bear-but it is the cross that paves the way for the crown, the gore that leads to glory. For those who love and believe that ""something extraordinary is possible"" even in the darkest hour when they could see a loved one falling apart beyond recognition, that extraordinary something indeed happens: patient love frees the beloved from the clutches of madness and living death until the hoped-for dawn returns."

The audience is in a character's reality, but that reality is a fantasy.  In his world, the character must now distinguish between that which is real and that which is fantasy.  And the audience must sift through two competing fantasies (the audience's experience of the film being the first fantasy, and the character's fantasy being the second).  And the screenwriter (Akiva Goldsman) has to keep all this straight, without being inconsistent, and provide meaning, and do it without being sappy or cliche or predictable.<br/><br/>Goldsman pulls it off in grand style.

","In this movie I found a brilliant idea and an almost deadly sin. The brilliant idea: The viewers watch the story from the viewpoint of a man who sees the world differently than the ""normal"" average person. We believe with John Nash that he is the only man capable of averting the mortal danger which is imminently threatening the USA. We share his doubts long after the first signs have appeared that John Nash is wrong and the average people around him are right. We also share John Nash's confusion and despair. It is wonderful and moving how well this strategy of the screenplay worked out in the actual movie.<br/><br/>The almost deadly sin is the love story. How could they do this to the viewers? It is as corny and stupid as it can possibly get, honestly. This is how it starts: The 1950s on a University Campus, in summer. A stuffy classroom, all windows open. Outside a gang of working men noisily drilling and hammering on the sidewalk. Enters the brilliant genius. Closes all windows. Students protest. Genius is adamant. A girl gets up, a very beautiful girl (looks like a model of the 1990s), walks provocatively, lasciviously (like a model of the 1990s) over to the window. Opens the window, shouts down to the working men in a nasty, drawn voice: ""Excuuuuuse me, we got an important class here. Couldn't you work somewhere else?"" And guess what? Not only do the working men immediately hear and understand her, no. ""Yes ma'am,"" they shout back. Then they pack up and move away double quick! And, of course, the seasoned watcher knows now: That's the girl he's gonna marry. Frankly, I can hardly get over it, it's so annoying!<br/><br/>Naturally, Nash's wife is (almost) as brilliant a scientist as he is. Yet according to the movie she sacrifices any job prospect just to care for her husband who endangers the life not only of himself but of the whole family. No question of sending him to an asylum! I detected a political message there which appears to be openly sexist. It displeased me.<br/><br/>In the second part of the movie the performance of Russel Crowe resembles more and more the one Tom Hanks delivered in Forrest Gump. The complexity of Nashs character is glossed over with the image of the bumbling, benevolent idiot many viewers seem to expect in this case. It's a minor complaint, but still it is somehow a pity if you know of Russel Crowe's acting capacities. Christopher Plummer is brilliant as Dr Rosen, the man who must try to bring Nash to his senses. It proves to me once again that a good supporting cast is essential for the success of a movie.<br/><br/>I wonder if Albert Einstein also got his pen collection when he was at Princeton and what he did with it.

","Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe stars as John Nash, mathematician and Nobel Prize Winner. We first see Crowe as a rather arrogant, if brilliant student, who descends into the hell that is mental illness. Or rather becomes aware that he suffers from schizophrenia. It is to the film's credit that Nash is not portrayed as a lovable eccentric, but rather more an asocial and at times unlikeable genius. Jennifer Connelly gives a realistic portrayal of his wife, who must assume the role of carer at times. She ably portrays the despair and frustration that goes with this.

","This was a good movie I have to admit. I think Russell Crowe gave one of the best performances of the year, and he (or Tom Wilkinson) deserved the Oscar when they were nominated. And Jennifer Connelly's performance really deserved the attention it got. But the movie as a whole just seems not cinematically important as some other movies released the same year and didn't get 10% the praise that this did. The fact that Ron Howard made this film says a lot. If this was a director's debut movie than he would forever be marked as a manipulative white-washer (meaning that he takes out details that would either enrich the story or add an edge to it if it didn't conform to the general public taste. In other words he rather be a follower than a leader. A leader wouldn't be afraid to push the film experience a bit.) I'm not in love with Moulin Rouge but I must commend Lurhmann for really giving his film life, energy, and color. He really change the way I look at how to make a movie. This movie is the exact  opposite of Moulin Rouge. It did have life,but had little energy, and barely any color. This film could of been made in black and white (at least that would of given this film an artistic edge). This film did not affect movie history to the effect that Fellowship of the Ring had. It didn't changed the way we look at a genre as Moulin Rouge had. It has not shocked us with performances that stir our thoughts and feelings after the credits like In The Bedroom.

","To say that battling mental Illness is tough, for me, is an understatement. For just over two years, I have suffered through the highs and lows of depression'. So it was with great anticipation that I watched the new Russell Crowe movie A Beautiful Mind'. Sure it has the Hollywood feel to it, but it is a film that I feel we can all learn from, and realise that any illness, even mental illness, can be overcome, if you really want too.<br/><br/>John Nash, a student at Princeton, struggles to think of an original idea that will make him matter to the world. Nash is eccentric, socially awkward, and extremely competitive. Eventually, he finds the inspiration for his innovative and influential work on game theory. He's chosen for a post at MIT, which includes crucial code-breaking work for the US government. There, he meets a beautiful and brilliant student, Alicia. They marry but their happiness is threatened, as Nash, belatedly diagnosed as schizophrenic, descends into madness.<br/><br/>Director of ABM' is the very skilled and successful Ron Howard. In this movie he shows just why he is a big Hollywood director toady. I liked how Howard shows Nash's debilitating illness, the timeline of the film, which was different to other movies, showing a similar story and how we meet certain unique characters. Howard was helped out with this film, by best friend and producer Brian Grazer. He placed his fine touches to the film, making it an even better experience to watch. <br/><br/>The story for ABM was taken from the novel (of the same name) by Sylvia Nasar. The story for the screen was written by Akiva Goldsman. Although its content has been hotly debated by many people, saying that it might not be as legitimate as the movie actually shows. It is my feeling that this story was cleverly devised by Goldsman, especially the make-believe characters that Nash interacts with, when he becomes extremely ill. This would have been a difficult story to get right', but I think that Goldsman got it spot on. <br/><br/>The main role in ABM was that of mathematician mastermind, John Nash (Russell Crowe). This role was quite different than the other roles that Crowe has taken on in the past. In ABM, he is a nervous, weird and mentally ill individual. Crowe's general onscreen demeanor is that of arrogance'. When we first see Crowe he is immediately into character, which gives his performance an even greater impact. This role would have been an extremely demanding one for Crowe, to become not only this brilliant mind, but to show the frightening side to Schizophrenia' and what patience of such an illness has to go through. Crowe also has to be commended for the way he interacts with all the imaginary characters of the film, as it is in his acting that you believe they might be real. This role in ABM shows just why Crowe is a successful Hollywood actor today. <br/><br/>But just as good as Crowe in ABM is the character of Alicia Nash (Jennifer Connelly). Her role gave the movie its main emotional avenue, with her love, faithfulness and vulnerability very impacting from where I viewed the movie. Another real' character I liked was Martin Henson (Josh Lucas). The confrontation he has with Nash at the start of the film is very interesting to see. However, Henson's compassion and friendship shown to Nash towards the end of the film is very touching.     <br/><br/>I am also a big fan of the roles taken on by the actors, who were imaginary characters in ABM. The three people in question are William Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and Marcee Herman (played very well by the cute Vivian Cardone). Every scene with any and all these performers is terrific to watch, and the movie shows them very well. My favourite scenes are when Nash believes his wife might be killed by Parcher and when Nash is in Henson's school office, trying very hard to ignore Charles. The way the movie shows both of these scenes, both being funny and dramatic, is the very reason I like it so much.                <br/><br/>There are other people behind the scenes that need to be highlighted for their work on the movie. The make-up department did a wonderful job in turning many of these young actors into the older people they are at the end of the film. The work done on both Crowe and Connelly was quite remarkable. The music to ABM was well composed by Titanic's' James Horner. The music makes the movie much more dramatic and emotional. In fact at one stage, I felt I was watching the Titanic' all over again. <br/><br/>John Nash is a brilliant man, showing that his mathematical skills are very invaluable for the world we live in. Nash is also a very complicated man as his mathematical discoveries are very complex. Although A Beautiful Mind' did win 4 Academy Awards, including best picture and director, I feel it should have won more, including Crowe's performance, which deserved a Best Actor Oscar. People have been quick to praise or criticise the way the movie showed the treatments in combating mental illnesses like Schizophrenia. I think we need to learn more about mental illness, and this movie goes some small to doing that. Having been affected by mental illness in my life, I really do have a soft spot for a film like this. To borrow a phrase I heard to describe this movie  A Beautiful Mind, is a Beautiful Movie!'<br/><br/>CMRS gives A Beautiful Mind': 4.5 (Very Good  Brilliant Film)"

","I was recommended this film and the end result after I viewed it is that I am forever grateful.  This film is based on a true story and is about the life of John Forbes Nash, a renouned mathematician professor at Princeton University.  What makes John's life so remarkable is not only all of his awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize; but his inability and then ability to cope with his mental illness.  I too would recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about mental illness."

","* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant<br/><br/> WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>  'A Beautiful mind' is the oscar winning biopic of John Forbes Nash Jr.A brilliant young mathematician who though an incredibly gifted genius is sadly lacking in any social skills.The cocky student is brought down a peg or two by fellow students who mock him for his arrogance.Eventually however,Nash manages to win their respect after making a ground breaking discovery and marries the beautiful Alicia Larde(Jennifer Connelly).<br/><br/> After graduating university Nash gets a job working for what appears to be the CIA.Working under the enigmatic William Parcher(Ed Harris),Nash becomes a code breaker who amazingly unravels numerous codes for the American government.But everything is not what it seems and the young scientist eventually finds that there is more to what is going on around him than meets the eye.A fact that also becomes very clear to his loving wife and friends.<br/><br/> This harrowing and touching drama has to rate as one of director Ron Howard's finest works to date.An excellent biopic that depicts the life of one man who struggles to come to terms with the demons that are suddenly presented in front of not only himself but those who care about him.Russell Crowe's portrayal of the cocky yet likable genius is simply breathtaking.An actor of true versatility,Crowe manages to make Nash everything that he is.An incredibly gifted man who is sadly also very naive in many ways.He manages to bring the right amount of cockiness to Nash while also making sure there is an under current of true vulnerability to the brilliant man.He is more than expertly supported by a fine cast of wonderful actors that includes the gorgeous,talented Jennifer Connelly(who won a best supporting actress oscar for her roll.) as Nash's wife Alicia.Ed Harris as the shadowy William Parcher, veteran actor Christopher Plummer and brit Paul Bettany as one of Nash's friends who is also not all he appears to be.<br/><br/> Mention must also go to screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's fantastic script which he has adapted from biographer Sylvia Nasar's book.it's surprising considering this is the man who penned the scripts for such dire travesties as the awful 'Batman and Robin' and the terrible 'Lost in Space'.This is the work of a man who has more of a knack at telling true human stories.Not fantastical sci-fi or action adventure movies.<br/><br/> Final recognition however must go to Ron Howard who has crafted a haunting testament of one man's life and the obstacles that he would have to over come.Howard,aided by Goldman's script does an excellent job of hiding the true facts of what is really happening to Nash,before hitting the audience with the reality of the situation like a ton of bricks.It's a revelation that is genuinely well done and shocking.<br/><br/> Some critics have criticised Howard and Goldsman for taking some artistic license in the presentation of the events of Nash's life.It does after all seem to pave over the fact that the handsome young scientist was supposedly bisexual as well.Such quibbles in the end however are minor and critics must remember that this is simply just a movie.At the end of the day what Howard and Goldsman are setting out to to do is to entertain an audience.Anyone who wishes to know the total truth about what happened to Nash should watch a documentary.<br/><br/> The movies only real flaw that it gets a little too 'Hollywood' for my liking towards the end.That said this is still an excellent example of a brilliant film about one mans struggle against adversity.The fact that the movie is based on a true story simply makes it all the more inspiring.Howard and the cast of actors he had assembled should be more than proud of what they have accomplished.My one complaint is that even though it was a wonderful movie it should never have won best picture at the 2002 oscars.That honor should have gone to Peter Jackson's awe inspiring adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring'.That aside I still recommend that you see one of Ron Howard's best movies to date.Chances are you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Robs Rating: * * * * *"
"engage2","Null","0","1","8 September 2003"," I love how it goes beyond the ordinary audience.
","I don't really watch movies often unless it relates to me or is ""beyond me"" and this is almost never, but here is a movie that relates to me in almost every way, with a few good curiousities that are a bit beyond me and thus far beyond the mentally-ordinary audience.<br/><br/> Its movies like this which opens public exchange forums up like this to gifted individuals and mathematical thinkers alike (usually one in the same), with a thing or two to say about these types of movies that are watched by all and only related to by few. I myself am a ""typical genius"" according to the definition used by Hans Eysneck in his book, ""Genius"", vis: he ""...concludes that the typical genius has an IQ some three to four standard deviations above the mean.""<br/><br/> There are two key elements that are significant in the material binding of the movie-to- audience via sight-to-sound processes:<br/><br/> 1) the movie educates the general audience by demonstrating the vast differences between the ordinary man and the genius- Hollywood style, of course. Which is exactly the opposite to ""Good Will Hunting"" a few years back that tends to trick the audience but in truth Will Hunting is an astoundingly deceptive genius. If he were not a janitor he would have shown his personality to have been more ""genius-like"". But obviously he is working an angle throughout the movie in order to keep his ordinary friends who he has nothing in common with except friendship and baseball- he is a complete mystery to the audience which is exactly the intended effect. Whereas, the intended effect of, ""A Beautiful Mind"" gives the audience complete knowledge of the inner-workings of this particular (super) genius by giving them the impression of, ""He is beyond me..."" using special effects and the like. It was assumed in some website by some psychologist, that the fictional character we know and love as Will Hunting, displays characteristics of someone with an IQ of around 190, a lot like Freidrich Gauss, ""The prince of mathematicians"". If I were to make an educated guess on John Nash's IQ I would say it is around 180. Einstein's was 160, surprisingly to many he was too a ""typical genius"".<br/><br/> 2) The music of ""A Beautiful Mind"" gives the audience musical insight into the inner-workings of John Nash- into his mind, heart and spirit. I do not wish to explain the movement of the music but the movement of the audience as it is much less complex and  appropiate for here: Basically, especially in the starting, various sound movements begin and gradually come into each other all at once, providing a parade of sound coming from all directions at once and into each audience member's ear.<br/><br/> In short: it'll blow your mind man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/> Those on this list who claim to dislike the movie are insecure about the things they like and so deny it when they think that no one else should admit themselves to liking it.<br/><br/> Why? Because although there are ""boring"" details around the middle that get into the negative human aspects of the man behind the genius (as there is always one), then one who claims that the movie sucks is sayin that ""there is no man behind the genius"" and thus are either, dumb (an understatement), or in denial of being let down after finding out that the genius can not only be a ""superman"" but also human like themselves. Look at Sir Isaac Newton, a genius's genius who had a breakdown in middle age.<br/><br/> That is all I have to say for this,"

","Alright, it was a well done movie for what it was, and interestingly executed, but it had the feel of a dry non-fiction work. It almost seemed like the hype and the Academy Award voting were tactical; you couldn't give Jennifer Connelly an Oscar for her brilliant performance in Requiem For A Dream, for instance, because after all Academy Awards can't go to naked women performing explicit kinky sex on camera in druggie films, but Beautiful Mind was just that sort of painfully earnest movie for which Academy members can impress one another at parties by claiming to have given it their votes. Now Crowe did a workmanlike job, Connelly was the spectacular eyecandy she's been capable of being her entire career, and the alternative to voting for this flick would have been to give Moulin Rouge a Best Picture nod, which would have been a crime against nature.<br/><br/>But that aside, while I saw this at Dollar Night at the Wollaston Theater, it's still two hours of my life I won't get back.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10 and that's generous."

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","2","12 August 2003"," An original idea
","PLOT SPOILERS INSIDE<br/><br/>Ok, I admit it, a film about a mathematician to many people seems like a bad idea. Let's just get that out straight away. Even the most intellectual person might sometimes find fault in a film about a genius. The thing is though that this film isn't as dull as that one notion might imply.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind charts the rise, fall & rise again of John Nash, one of the cleverest men of the 20th Century. It starts with his rise at Princeton & his ""Original Idea"" which challenges Adam Smith's Economic principle of everyone working for themselves. Eventually John ends up working for the Government, before it is revealed that the people from the government don't exist & John imagines them. John finally learns to ignore these delusions however & his star rises once again.<br/><br/>When I went to see this film, I confess to being sceptical. I'd seen Gladiator & the idea of Maximus becoming a Mathematician seemed almost impossible and I couldn't understand the fuss of this film. Then however I watched the entire film and reappeared a changed man. Russell Crowe could infact be a quality Mathematician & provided possibly his finest performance (in my view), and the film indeed deserved all of it's praise. There are many reasons why people suggest Russell didn't get the Oscar for his performance, but I do confess that Washington deserved it. The simple reason that Washington deserves the Oscar is that whilst I don't feel Training Day could succeed without Denzil, the script & other actors performances in this film were so startlingly brilliant, that I hate to say it, but it still probably would have won best film without Russell's appearance.<br/><br/>Anyway, the flaws with this film. One friend of mine got increasingly upset one day when I claimed that this film was magical & deserved all it's praise. Her arguements were simply that the film didn't take account of certain things in the book and more scarily that The Lord Of The Rings was better. Now I've never read the book (to be fair, neither had she, she'd just read a negative review), but as for The Lord Of The Rings, whilst I confess to finding it enjoyable, I don't think it is in the same league as this film. The plot of LOTR is just as stunning, but it doesn't make you think in the same way and personally I don't feel it has the same Longitivity. I've seen both films the same number of times, but whilst I try to avoid LOTR (the first one anyway) now, I feel I could keep watching A Beautiful Mind over and over again. That's part of it's brilliance.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the thing I adore about A Beautiful Mind (and the same things I love about K-Pax and Donnie Darko) is that it presents you with a brilliant suggestion which you can sit and think about for hours on end. In Donnie Darko there is Donnie's situation, in K-Pax there's certain comments Prot makes about time, humans and Earth, and in this film there are the notions of coming up with an original idea (something I confess to have been trying to do for two years of University now) and more importantly the problems of trying to force someone with a mental problem to take drugs. No doubt I'm bound to have some Psychologists shouting at me here, but these people seem to be very split on this view. What I fail to understand is why we don't consider Nash's views more and try and cure these people using discussion and reason rather than pumping them full of drugs. One Psychology student I spoke to shot me down and instantly claimed that they need the drugs for reasons I confess to forgetting, whilst another person I know who is actually a practicing Psychologist completely agreed with me (but then, she was drunk!). Anyway, the beauty of this film is that it gives us this idea and attempts to get us to think about it. That is what this type of film should try to do and it is what A Beautiful Mind does perfectly.<br/><br/>So to summarise, a quality script, stunning acting, excellent lighting and a truely Beautiful Mind. Watch, Think, Discover Yourself."
"chanelit-1","Null","0","1","7 August 2003"," Almost Brilliant
","A Beautiful Mind is a movie about the life of John Nash, a brilliant Mathematician who lectured at M.I.T. in between developing mind-bending theories. There was an awful lot of scope for the film to take in, a genius who virtually corrupted his own mind in pursuit of theorems that most of us will never understand. The film itself doesn't quite deliver in the way it could or should, but that's wholly understandable.<br/><br/>It doesn't really touch on the elegance of mathematics at all but focuses more on Nash as a person as his increasingly schizophrenic condition. In this part, the film succeeds. Crowe gives an outstanding performance as Nash and Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his wife. It's a very emotive film and closer to the truth of the condition than most realise Â– for anyone who has suffered with mental ill health, one can appreciate some of the torment and turmoil that Nash goes through.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent film, competently directed by Ron Howard, but as with virtually all of his films, it could have been so much more. It's one of those movies that almost achieves greatness, but falls short. It is an emotional saga and will no doubt illicit the odd tear from the audience, but as a story about one of the greatest mathematicians of last century it doesn't quite add up (pun intended)."

Maybe I am just a big old softy, but I don't cry at most movies I see.<br/><br/>And Jennifer Connelly , well there's an actress with perserverance, she has been in more than her fair share of dud movies, but finally a great part and she cleans up at the awards ceremonies.

","**Contains Spoilers**<br/><br/>Knowing that mathematician John Nash was a real person can lead to some real confusion while watching this movie. For example, before I realized that he had schizophrenia, I was wondering how I managed to go through 12 years of public school without hearing about the mathematician who cracked codes and saved the country from Russia. However, it did make sense at the end, and I wasn't left with any lingering questions. <br/><br/>This is a very character-driven movie, despite the fact that the commercials make it look like a preachy, confusing nerd piece. Russell Crowe does a great job as the almost android-like Nash, who has no social skills whatsoever around women (I was reminded more than once of Lt. Cmdr Data of Star Trek: TNG trying to woo someone) and has no love greater than math. Well, until he meets Alicia, that is. Their love is a bit hard to buy, especially since he's not very charming and she strikes me as a bit of a bitch, but it's an essential part of the movie and it doesn't hurt the flow too much.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is great, really. But somewhere around the time he gets out of the institution, it gets really anticlimactic. Personally, I think it would have been a lot better if it had ended before he grew really old and suddenly everyone loved him. <br/><br/>As for the trippiness factor, watch it and see what you think. The shed scene is especially mind-boggling."

","A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>July 2003 Jane Dooley John Desando Film Class<br/><br/>
A Beautiful Mind is a wonderfully unique look at the life of a gifted Nobel prize winner whose schizophrenia challenges his desires to succeed. Russell Crowe stars as John Nash the highly accomplished mathematician, and Jennifer Conelly as his wife, Alicia.  Director Ron Howard starts the movie in the 1940's as Crowe enters Princeton University with an arrogant attitude and a loner style.<br/><br/>Crowe spends his college days focusing on game theories as his brain spends time sending him into frightening delusions.   These delusions escalate to the point where Crowe believes the Russians are communicating with him through coded messages in newspapers and magazines.  Howard continues to demonstrate how a disease can affect such a complex mind. This pattern continues to haunt him throughout his life, although his supportive wife Jennifer Connelly struggles to keep Crowe within the realms of society.<br/><br/>
Ed Harris plays a federal agent who pursues Crowe and occupies most of his horror within his delusions.  As Crowe truly believes he is the `chosen one' to transcribe secret messages, his behavior becomes even more bizarre to his wife and friends. Connelly makes a decision to seek help for her tortured husband as he tries to escape the overwhelming madness in his mind.<br/><br/>Like Salma Hayek, the Mexican painter in Frida, John fights for his inner passion just as Salma Hayek does to become a well-known artist in her country.    Fridas complex mind is also a pillar of strength in her fight to overcome her disabilities.  Both characters are in agonizingly difficult situations in their pursuit of a dream while they fight to hold on to the one person they truly love the most.<br/><br/>
A Beautiful Mind, takes place in a more conservative and simple time uses a variety of angled shots to set the emotions.  The intensity of shots changes as Crowes mind fluctuates from reality to hallucination.  Crowe seeing himself in various situations, that are not real, enable the shots to be taken from high above or from down toward the ground looking up.  This style helps build the realism in his mind.  One of the scenes that depict this wonderfully is when John thinks Harris has taken him to a secret complex. The building houses the equipment and a device used for Crowe to decode what are to be secret messages up on the screens.  The letters and numbers appear with a glow and the camera angle is shot from the floor up.<br/><br/>This is an incredible biography of one mans life who teeters in and out of sanity with the strength and devotion of his wife to carry him through. Crowe shows us that even in the dark depths of our minds we can rise up and conquer our demons with continued force to live our lives as best we can."

Overestimated, but that is not the issue here. I had seen the trailer and thought that it could actually be a nice movie.To be honest, mrs.

","...must be crazy!  I thought this film was wonderful.  I can't imagine how Hollywood could make a film which was more intelligent and sensitive about the subject of mental illness.  I write as someone who grew up in a family where a parent was suffering from...cockle doodle doo...paranoid schizophrenia, so I have some first hand experience of the malady.  Face it, people.  It's not a fun subject.  But this film did portray what it's like to be around someone who is suffering from this.  And...yikes...to actually suffer from it.  That's a small miracle.  <br/><br/>If the screenwriter took a few liberties with the story, characters, and so on, he caught what mattered.  Nash's story is unique.  If he hadn't won the Nobel Prize there's no way this film would have been made (it would have lacked the ""Hollywood ending"").  And that's the film's genius.  Because it does end this way the film makers are able to depict mental illness for what it is (and I can't think of another film which does this and isn't so depressing it drives away the audience).  Well done.  Clap clap clap."

","WARNING: Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>When A Beautiful Mind first took home the oscars for best picture and director in 2001, I was incensed that Lord of the Rings was so overlooked. Six months later, I looked back and laughed. I marvelled at how I could have been so caught up in LOTR hype that I had forgotten what a truly brilliant film this was.<br/><br/>There is never any doubting the awesome power of this film. It's a movie like two weights attached to your tear ducts that keep getting heavier and heavier until you finally give in to temptation and weep into your hands.<br/><br/>However, there are a few questions raised by this film. For one thing, it has been much publicised recently that it presents a fake, Hollywood depiction of schizophrenia, and the real disorder is completely dissimilar to what is portrayed here. The film tries to compensate for this by suggesting that this is highly advanced and it has gone on untreated for many years in John Nash's mind.<br/><br/>For one who has not read the Sylvia Nasar's book, I cannot be sure how accurate a depiction this is, I would suggest that Akiva Goldsman and Ron Howard took a lot of artistic license to this film to create a more moving, and dare I say, perhaps more interesting story. Not that the results isn't good, I just think it's important that when you watch this for the first time, you are made more aware that you are watching the story of a man called John Nash, rather than necessarily a biography of the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash.<br/><br/>The other question that is raised, at least for me, is what is the magnitude of Nash's hallucinations? On the surface we are led to believe that his hallucinations stretch the extent of an imaginary room-mate, an imaginary niece and an imaginary job for the department of the defence led by an imaginary man in a hat and coat. But obviously it's more degenerative than this. He imagines an entire workforce with a large amount of tracking and locating devices, a radium implant in his arm. Later, he completely imagines all of this machinery moved to a small shed not a hundred metres from his back fence. When you stop to think about it, it begins to seem a little far-fetched. Another question as well, how much else did he hallucinate? The first time he drops a letter in the private mailbox, a car drives past and someone stares at him, who he immediately suspects is a Russian. Did the car really drive past or did he just imagine it? It's possible that it did, I mean if one drives past an old ramshackle, abandoned house and there's a man dropping off a parcel, one would most likely stare. But obviously at this stage of the game, the audience is living out Nash's dreamscape. But once we find out that none of this is real, these earlier raised questions beg some scrutinising, in my opinion.<br/><br/>However, if you don't think about it, it's brilliant. Russell Crowe is superb in an incredibly hard role, Jennifer Connelly also brilliant, and Ed Harris dazzles as usual. It's superbly intricate in its direction and it manages to mix tension and suspense with human emotion to a masterful degree.<br/><br/>The artistic license may take a lot of the realism out of the story but it definitely doesn't detract from the effect. 4 1/2 stars out of 5."

"kfinley1","Null","0","1","22 March 2003"," Love and devotion between two people can overcome a major obstacle in life
","SPOILER!!`A Beautiful Mind' spans nearly fifty years of the adult life of John Nash; a mathematics genius that is diagnosed as schizophrenic but successfully overcomes the disorder.  Russell Crowe gives a superb performance of Nash's complicated range of personalities.  Jennifer Connelly performs equally well as Nash's wife, Alicia, who is dedicated to seeing her husband through his illness.  The film shows that the love and devotion between two people can overcome a major obstacle in life.<br/><br/>
In the opening scenes at Princeton University, Nash is portrayed as being arrogant and antisocial.  His priority is to find an original topic idea for his doctorate thesis that would provide him with a prestigious position.  His hard work pays off and he is given a research and teaching assignment at MIT.  At this point, he begins working with the government as an undercover agent since he has an extraordinary talent of seeing patterns in numbers.<br/><br/>
Nash falls in love with Alicia, one of his students, and they marry. Their happiness is interrupted, however, when he is diagnosed with schizophrenia and the treatments, medications, and recovery process begins. Working together Alicia and Nash begin to build a new life in reality. Nash eventually returns to Princeton and gradually earns the respect of both students and faculty.<br/><br/>Alicia exhibits the majority of the love and devotion by staying by Nash's side throughout the diagnosis and treatment of his schizophrenia. There are few direct indications of Nash's feelings for Alicia.  However, a recurring motif in the film is Alicia's handkerchief.  The handkerchief becomes evidence of Nash's dependence upon and affection toward Alicia. Specifically, it becomes a symbol of an important reality in his life that he needs to help stabilize his condition.<br/><br/>
The movie has a surprise twist that is very effective in making the audience try to distinguish between what is reality and what is not. Like `The Sixth Sense,' the twist in this film makes the audience reevaluate what they have seen.  This also helps the audience sympathize more when Nash undergoes the treatment and recovery process.<br/><br/>Through the use of love, emotion, and a plot twist, `A Beautiful Mind' holds the audience's interest, and conveys that by working together, the major difficulties in a couple's life can be overcome."

","While this film may be a great deal fantasy, I cannot help but appraise this film for finally drawing sympathy for people like John Nash.  I am close to people like this and always felt it really sad that these people try so hard and are not even known, but instead thought crazy.  I still find it fascinating how the mind thinks for multiple people.  Sure, there were some flaws and it could be improved, but at least it is a start.  Before this, few people really knew how hard emotionally it is for schizophrenics, and even now most people don't see the difficulty.  The visual hallucinations are exaggerated, but these people really believe these hallucinations are real, so likewise the film makes you believe they are real also. Anyways, I'm glad to see someone finally take the time to show how much these people go through."

","'A Beautiful Mind' IS a good movie.  The acting is quite good, the story itself is ho-hum, but it just doesn't have what it takes to be a Best Picture.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with Russell Crowe's performance.  I might just have to go all the way and say that I wouldn't have been upset if he would have won that Oscar.  He did a terrific job; he let his emotions flow, didn't seem to annoy me...no complaints here.  Okay, I have a complaint.  I did not agree with the casting of Jennifer Connelly. Am I truly the only one that thought that her role was extremely small?  I mean she just didn't have that big of a part.  She won her Oscar for some reason, not really sure why.  Ed Harris was alright.  He wasn't anything spectacular, but he certainly was better than Connelly.  I can't really remember any of the other actors just because they were all males, plus they looked somewhat similar to each other.  <br/><br/>I'm not too thrilled with the story itself.  I had never even heard of John Nash before.  It seemed interesting, but then boring after a while, then it picked up, but became tiresome again.  It was a bit long, so I was somewhat relieved when it finally did come to an end. <br/><br/>Okay, 'A Beautiful Mind' is good, but it did not deserve to be named Best Picture of the year.  I'm not sure that I would have even thought to put it in the nomination category.  The thing is is that Ron Howard did a wonderful job.  I'm a big fan of Howard; loved him for years.  He's an amazing director and his direction of the film is handled so well, but for some reason the movie just did not deserve that award.  He, however, did deserve his long awaited Oscar as it was rightfully awarded.  That didn't really make sense what I just said, but the main point that I'm trying to get across is that Howard did a great job.<br/><br/>'A Beautiful Mind' is a good film to watch if you have the time and patience for a pretty slow paced movie.  Normally that would bug me to no end, but it's not as bad here.  It does lag though, at times.  It may have been nominated for a load of awards (winning half), but was still in need of that extra touch to really make it shine."

","CONTAINS SPOILER! Wow! Finally a film worth `wooing' over!  `A Beautiful Mind', directed by the critically acclaimed brilliant Ron Howard (`Apollo 13'), depicts the heroic yet tragic life of Nobel laureate John Forbes Nash.  Howard went to great lengths recreating two very distinct but very different worlds that Nash lived, a Princeton graduate and genius Mathematician, and then his delusional life of secrecy encrypting codes for the government while in constant paranoia of Russian detection.  The film goes into great depth to show us that what we think and feel is real, may in fact be a figment of our imagination.<br/><br/> Unlike the intense action films, (`Gladiator' and `Proof of Life') we are used to seeing Russell Crowe in, here, he plays a much deeper part portraying his interpretation of John Nash.  Don't look for an action-packed film here, this biography more so delves into the mind of a brilliant man losing control, battling schizophrenia.  How refreshing it was to see Crowe become so engrossed and intertwined with the character he essentially `became'.  Crowe captured the feelings of entrapment, loneliness, and confusion; Nash must have expressed living in a world of fantasy.  Crowe acted with such grace and confidence that I wonder how it is possible for him to win an Oscar for his less than perfect performance in `Gladiator', only to be overlooked for his stellar performance in this film!<br/><br/> Not only did the film show us the awesome power of the mind, but also the power of unconditional love and hope.  Jennifer Connelly gives an equally impressive performance as Alicia Larde, Nash's wife.  She is the one stable aspect in Nash's life, but clearly shows you just how agonizing and painful it is for loved ones to live in a situation such as that depicted in the film.  The love and hope of Nash's wife is what keeps him alive, it encourages him to fight the disease and never give up.  Alicia is quoted, saying, `In order to make it, she had to believe that something extraordinary was possible'.  And it was, together, the two fought and conquered the very illness that threatened to overtake John for so long.<br/><br/> `A Beautiful Mind' is a heartwarming film that shows a hero spiraling out of control, yet through love and determination, triumphs in the end. The film is very powerful, in that, it gives new appreciation to those having to live with this terrible disease of the mind. `A Beautiful Mind' was happy and sad, courageous and helpless, showed love and hate, reality and fantasy; everything necessary to create a timeless classic this film is sure to become."

","I read the book before I saw the film.  The book is about a man's life, the film is about a man's schizophrenia.  The book discusses relationships between people.  The film brings in other people as a matter of convenience and doesn't do any relationship development at all.  Judging by how artists view art as being the spiritual interpretation of the physical, the book is the physical the film is the spiritual and therefore art.  I don't disagree with that at all.  The way the film draws the viewer into the world of the schizophrenic is very effective and frightening.  I don't know if Howard had Wilder's The Lost Weekend in mind when he did this film but there is certainly a spiritual comparison here.<br/><br/>The film is supposed to be based on Nasar's book but the only place I've heard most of the the things the film brings up are from Nash's own mouth as revealed in TV interviews.  So don't look for a condensed version of the book, this film is something altogether different.<br/><br/>I suppose if Crowe hadn't thought it appropriate to flip off America's elite while filming at Princeton he would have won the Oscar for best male lead but as it was the film garnered wins in other areas that were entirely appropriate.

","Outstanding flick, made so by the performance of Crowe. Since the Academy Awards rarely honor the best acting performance as advertised, I'm shocked people still get miffed.

Like many long ones, this drags at the 3/4 pole and kinda kills the momentum. But its still a rare breath of quality that's definitely worth your while. Connelly is incredible as is Harris, and Opie as usual does a fine job behind the megaphone.

","First of all, let me say one thing: I didn't see about half of this film the first time I saw it because I was too busy crying. It's such a heartbreaking story and if the nay-sayers took one minute to think about a life like John Nash's and how Russell Crowe portrayed him in this, they'd understand what a beautiful movie this is. The acting was incredible, the script, cast, plot, cinematography, music...EVERYTHING was top-notch.<br/><br/>  What else can I say?

","Nash was West Virginian, but you'd never guess it by watching this movie. Once in a while, Crowe will substitute a short ""a"" sound for a long ""i"" sound, but that is about it. I would rather he not have tried for the accent at all than settle for this laughable effort.<br/><br/>I keep reading reviews about his fantastic acting job in this movie, so I have to ask: Am I the only person to notice the poor dialect he developed?"
"movieguy1021","8","0","2","1 January 2003"," A Beautiful Mind: 8/10
","At the 2001 Academy Awards, A Beautiful Mind got four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Screenplay from Another Medium. It well deserved all of them.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is John Forbes Nash. He's an acclaimed mathematician. He reluctantly teaches a class at Princeton, where he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). It doesn't take a genius to know that they get married. However, what Alicia, and John, don't know is that John is a schizophrenic. His life soon turns to shambles as he tries to piece together what's real in his life and what's not.<br/><br/>It could only be Ron Howard who could make this believable. Of course, the story of John Nash is unbelievable, but it could be played with such unnatural pathos, making the story too silly to be likeable. Howard, however, could turn this into a compelling drama that you'll enjoy sitting through. The over-two-hour runtime seems to fly by. A Beautiful Mind has about everything a drama needs: palpable drama, romance, a few tense scenes, and even a little humor. Not much, but a little.<br/><br/>The slow camera movements added to the general creepiness. Such as the clichÃ©d use of little girls with big eyes to add tension, the creeping camera brought out the feel of the picture that is very tangible. If you just take an ordinary `drama', you can't connect to any of the characters. Howard, along with screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, made Nash a likeable character, even from his asocial and agoraphobic tendencies from the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>James Horner created great music for this film. It's actually a soundtrack that I'm thinking of purchasing; he got robbed at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Goldsman's script was so masterfully written. It seems like he could become an object to behold soon in the future. It seemed, however, like he wanted each line to be a memorable one that everyone in the future would remember. Although some of them may be, it was a turn off (but one of the few from the film). I think that Howard and Goldsman can become a worthy team soon on.<br/><br/>Crowe did a better job here than in other movies, such as Gladiator. His genuine fear was very well displayed, though I don't think he got cheated at the Oscars. Connelly (who looked a lot like Andie McDowell to me) was also quite good, but, personally, didn't deserve her Oscar. Ed Harris, I think, did the best performance in the film as an FBI man, William Parcher. I could really feel for these characters, they did an excellent job as a whole.<br/><br/>There's not much more to say, it was a great movie that everyone should see.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence."
"The_Sceptic","5","0","1","29 December 2002"," You can only say this film is average at best. (mild spoiler).
","I've never really liked films which glorify people while they're still alive and despite all the problems we see Nash go through, there is just something wrong with it, it all seems very vain. Like when Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Robson unveiled their statues here in England recently, tributes like that should be reserved for the dead.<br/><br/>Besides, the film wasn't very good anyway, I didn't really think Crowe was Oscar material as Nash mumbling with that silly accent through it all. Connelly (I can't believe that was the girl from 'Labyrinth'!)dutifully just did what she had to and the relationship between the two was wooden at best. Ron Howard never really made us understand how any woman could be attracted to this man, probably because we never got to appreciate Nash's genius as we saw him most of the time as a right weirdo.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I liked the idea that the 'doctors' this time were actually trying to help him and not conventionally the bad guys. I only wish I was able to leave the cinema understanding more of why Nash won the Nobel prize and the contributions he gave us. Still, the film has just enough intrigue to keep the ball rolling. 5/10."
"lingmeister","7","0","2","28 December 2002"," A good story about schizophrenia
","A Beautiful Mind, is not a movie about the life of John Nash or about a mathematical genius. It is about a person whose schizophrenia gets worse and worse and how he overcomes it.<br/><br/>To label it as a story of John Nash, portrayed here by Russell Crowe, is inaccurate.  Much of the unsavory parts of his life has been edited out and other parts has been changed.  This is all to make him a character whose only flaw is his sickness, which is also something the filmmaker wants the people to sympathize with.  Plus, many characters seem to be invented so that it will easily fill the story.  Watching the film at first, and then finding out his true life, you feel as if have been conned by the filmmakers.  I think if they dealt with all aspects of his life, likeable or not, his character would have been more real, and it would have made a fuller and more complex film.<br/><br/>The mathematics aspects of the film seems to be glossed over much like window dressing, all to display his abstract genius mind without delving into anything deep and truly explaining the complexities of it.  When I was watching the film and saw the numbers being highlighted, I thought this was a pathetic joke, something like math for dummies, a picturisque coffee table version.  Eventually you realize the movie has nothing to do with mathematics.  In some aspect, I was disappointed by it.<br/><br/>The film's true focus is on his sickness, including all the delusions he has, his treatments and all the effects it had on him, his temptation to go back to his old exciting self and eventually his will to fight the battle on his own.  It all makes for a emotional drama, although it is one that is heavily sugar coated by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe performed remarkably in this film.  He was always a versatile actor, with a great performance in The Insider.  If it was not for the mysterious Oscar that he got for The Gladiator, he surely would have won one for this.  As for the Oscar that Ron Howard and the film got, it is questionable since the film was not groundbreaking.  I guess that is why films like this gets Ron the Oscars and Mulholland Drive gets David Lynch the award at Cannes.<br/><br/>In all, recommended, given that one take it as a film about a man's fight with his sickness and nothing more."

","A Beautiful Mind is marketed as a story ""Based on events in the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr."".  Nowadays, however, based on is a fairly loose term.  The sheer number of factual errors and liberties taken with the life of the schizophrenic mathematician are too many to count, so perhaps it is best to think of this film as a fiction.  That said, this otherwise mediocre movie is elevated to an extreme degree by Russell Crowe's brilliant performance. As John Nash, Crowe is nothing short of astounding.  He single handedly redeems the film, and raises it past the level of mediocrity.  In truth, this film won four academy awards it should not have (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress), and lost the one award for which it should have been a shoo-in (Best Actor).

He saw secret codes everywhere, including many that weren't there. I haven't read much about Nash, so am not certain how factual this is. This is Russell Crowe's best work yet. It's difficult to play an insane person, but he pulls off playing John Nash very nicely.

There is a possibility, that single man like you or like me could describe a whole world, but when it comes to real life nothing can help you more than understanding and support of your closest people. You will see, that John Nash is a genius, who develops something new, and gives whole himself to the problem. He is the man, who can find a  solution to this hard equilibrium. And this equilibrium is life. Sometimes it might be hard to understand the life. Who can tell you what is right or what is wrong, who can define what is real or what is not? We come to this point where only dedicated group of people can tell you what is right. These are psychiatrists. Group of people who decides whether human is normal or not. John Nash really had some trouble with himself, but this also helped him to       create his theory. Before this Dr. Rosen we think that everything what is happening around is hundred percent real. And this Doctor is just another person who disturbs John's work and life, but suddenly we realize, that John might need help anyway. At early stage of it it is seen that it is really hard for him to get along with himself and his wife. I would also like to highlight their relationship. Alicia is love with John forever and she will help him at any cost. Love is real John understood this words in its full meaning. His eyes told everything he really needed help, but not clinical just a little social. His wife was the only man on Earth who could help him and it is the only man who can understand him. Finally i would like to say that when something is right it will be right forever. And John Nash knew that he was right, and this helped him to do, what he believed had to be done. I have to tell that this is one of the greatest movie i have ever seen."

Sure, everything begins to rapidly accelerate for a moment as Nash is wrapped up in some sort of government conspiracy, but soon everything slows and the movie really trudges at a moderate pace.<br/><br/>Spoilers are definitely coming.<br/><br/>Nash's transformation into the paranoid, totally freaked-out husband is interesting, of course.  I was really getting involved with the movie, wondering what everything meant, what was going to happen to him, his wife, and his unborn child.<br/><br/>Then the mental hospital doctor's came, and everything began to go downhill. Once they keep him under control and try to show him that what he sees isn't real, the movie really slows.  In truth, I was captivated, siding with Nash and saying to myself, ""No, it's real!""  That was probably the best part of the movie.  It was almost like a twist.  I could have never guessed those people weren't real.<br/><br/>But that did not sustain the movie.  It didn't come together really well at the end, it was rather boring, and, although great if you're into movies that explore the depths of psychology, I found it quite tedious.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind can really catch one's attention at the beginning, but it can't hold its pace.

It is most definitely a great movie to watch.<br/><br/>I believe that this extraordinary film was nominated for the best picture academy award because the story was about Nash's life through his own eyes.

The dialogue is a collection of wannabe profound soundbites which convince neither as the musings of the characters saying them or as the deep aphorisms the writer mistakenly perceived he was educating us all with.  Howard's direction seems (almost purposefully) to miss the entire point that this should be a SUBTLE study of descent into and battling with madness.  Instead we see the Hollywood lexicon for what thick viewers will recognise as madness: Nash gets angry for no reason; Nash writhes and foams; Nash chases his own tail; etc...  And as pedestrian as Howard's non-functioning direction is - it isn't remotely helped by Crowe's interpretation of a tortured genius as: Spacker Camp!  Crowe's grossly offensive (clearly un-thought out) attempt to portray insanity as a man walking around with the initial symptoms of cerebral palsy and talking with an affected, pseudo-effeminate register is the stuff of notoriety.

Russell Crowe is impressive, but somehow he never convinces me that he is someone else than Russel Crowe. Jennifer Connelly is competent, but her academy award was undeserved. Her performance is mostly not a very memorable one, acting out almost all the different and sometimes difficult scenes professionally but with no personality. It like there is a switch on her back, set from OFF to CARE.<br/><br/>The fault may not be with her acting abilities though because Ron Howard's direction is, as always, very slick and without an ounce of character. He knows what he is doing every second throughout the movie and where to push the right buttons for ""emotions"". All in all, a perfect date movie or something to watch if you have a couple of hours to spare.

","""A Beautiful Mind"" is an honoured film. Lots of awards has been coming it's way and I understand it as this film is an archeotype of the kitschy image a lot of directors have on making film.<br/><br/>In fact, the film is kitsch. The result is always going to be so when the introductory view from the directors point is that ""we are going to make art/history etc."". Indeed Ron Howard has always wanted to make THAT film that could keep everybody talking. Looking at his records show that he so far has not artistically been very succesful. With all these awards, notably beating Robert Altman in Best Directing at the Oscars and DGA, has he then achieved it? Has he made art with ""A Beautiful Mind""?<br/><br/>No. Far from. He has elaborated on his very oldfashioned look at making movies, and he has shown his disrespect for the viewers.<br/><br/>
Take a look at the dialogue in this one. Do people really talk like this? Did they do that in the '50s? No. Between Nash and his wife there isn't a single real-life conversation. Ron Howard does not have time for such common things. Common things in his mind cannot be art. So the couple are left with a cribbling dialogue that never explain their affection for each other but simply displays them as puppets. They are not real people. (A bizarre thing to say when the plot centers around an authentic story!)<br/><br/>Ron Howard's best effort so far IMO has been ""EdTV"". That was a charming film that did not try to be more than it was: Entertaining. The characters in it were (so to speak) normal - and so was the dialogue. Strange that even the real people in ""A Beautiful Mind"" have to be so shallow.<br/><br/>Also, Howard believes that the audience is more or less stupid. This leeds him to giving up on all subtleness and explaining everything very clearly. I don't like being spoken to as if I was stupid - do you? It destroys the overall issues of this film - and I cannot help thinking that it is so odd Howard never even tries to elaborate on Nash's theories and his importance. He has given up on us from the very start.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe is a always a rock, but here his performance tend to be unintentionally amusing - remember Anthony Hopkins in ""Legends Of The Fall""? You want to laugh as his character deteriorates - but no no, this is serious stuff. Does Ron Howard really thing life is that serious? Where is the authenticity in this real life story?<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is given very little to work with. She whispers and has got a different hair-do from time to time - and then there is the obliged breakdown that gave her the Oscar. Only Winslet and Smith were AMPAS nominees in the supporting category this year without displaying ""breakdowns"". Food for thought, eh? Anyway; even Connelly's breakdown seems odd. Howard so bad wanted the Oscar for her.<br/><br/>Kitsch is what this film is about. Indeed the weakest of the five Best Picture nominees.

I'm not saying it wasn't a good movie, but I will say it's not that great of an idea. If you think about it, almost everybody overcomes some great handicap (although some not as severe as others).  It's almost as if an actor takes the role of a handicapped person he/she is a ""shoe-in"" for at least a nomination. Does Forrest Gump and Rainman ring a bell.

From the first second you were introduced to these characters, you knew what they represented.  It is incomprehensible how a writer could develop such a multi-dimensional plot, but fill the story with such simple, stagnant characters. <br/><br/>Crowe's Nash came across much like all of Crowe's characters: aloof, unfeeling, and detached.

"csm23","Null","0","1","9 September 2002"," Gauging reality a problem for us all
","OK, I know what you're thinking:  it doesn't take much skill to recommend A Beautiful Mind, seeing as how it took the prize for best picture at the academy awards last year, when there were several legitimate contenders. It's a no-brainer, right?  But even if you've already seen it, I suggest you take another look.  Why?  Because it raises a number of fascinating questions about ultimate reality.<br/><br/>Here's the problem, for all of us:  if something exists solely in our minds, Can't we say that it is as real as any material object?  A famous psychologist (James Hillman) once made the point that, if mental problems are the result of a skewed or misaligned imagination, then mental healing is also a healing of the imagination.  And this is no trivial matter, because the human imagination is such a powerful thing.  An athlete who practices visualization techniques before competition, for example, is consciously rehearsing his performance in his head.  He's not actually doing his event, only thinking through it;  but his active imagination produces a measurable difference.  He's setting himself up to succeed.  So, Isn't this real?  We all imagine things that aren't real.  Are we all, therefore, crazy?  At what point does this healthy practice become destructive?<br/><br/>The life of John Nash, as constructed by this film, gets to the heart of the question, which is particularly relevant these days because of the plethora of `reality' television shows, all of which suggest that ultimate reality is, by necessity, painful, humiliating, and bad  perhaps even evil.  John Nash, in his effort to keep his feet on the solid earth of verifiable truth without clipping the wings of his imaginative genius, comes to a different conclusion, modeled both in words and deeds by his wife.  She asks him, in a wonderful bedroom scene, `Do you want to know what's real?'  And then, placing his hand on her bosom, she answers `this.'  Love.  It's the perfect setup for the penultimate scene, where, accepting the Nobel Prize, Nash says that `it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reason can be found.'  I think it's an excellent answer to the question."

"nyrunner","Null","0","1","28 August 2002"," Beautiful Title, Bad Film
","This purported biographical film of John Nash's life is so patently false that the names of all the characters should have been changed before it's release.  Nash had two wives and two sons and was a bisexual who had numerous affairs with both men and women.  Virtually none of this is in the plot.  But even if we ignore the inaccuracies how does A Beautiful Mind hold up as a film?  Not very well I am afraid.  According to Ron Howard's version John Nash appears out of nowhere on a college campus in 1947.  After one triumphant moment he spends the next few years as somewhat of a social outcast until a beautiful student takes an interest in the shy and remote young man, who, according to the film, would have most likely remained single and a virgin were it not for this interest.  Is this a true picture of schizophrenia?  I doubt it.  Is this a biography of John Nash?  It certainly is not.  Is this even entertaining?  Hardly.  The film is a steady downward spiral of the main character's mental illness with very few enlightening or uplifting moments to leaven the material until the bizarre and totally out of character Rocky-like ending.<br/><br/>I was not even impressed with the performances.  Russell Crowe, who, in The Insider, arguably gave the best performance by an actor in the last decade, is all tics and mannerisms.  One hopes that in his next film he chooses better material and a better writer.  Jennifer Connelly is very good, but it is a nothing role, all reaction.  Roger Deakin's cinematography, however, is, as always, superb.  Of the writing one can only ask, did this man even read the book that this film is supposed to be based on?  It is as if the writer took the idea of John Nash and wrote a script about that.<br/><br/>
I did like two scenes.  Howard's visualization of Nash's games' theory using a blonde woman and her friends was excellent and actually gives one the idea that Howard could have made a much better film about Nash had he been given an actual script.  And the scene where Nash and Alicia look at the stars and he draws pictures in the sky was touchingly romantic.<br/><br/>
That this film won the Academy Award best picture of the year over such obviously superior films as Gosford Park, In the Bedroom, and Lord of the Rings should come as no surprise.  Apollo 13, Ron Howard's best film and the one for which he should have taken the Oscar, lost to the stunningly mediocre Braveheart and Mel Gibson, the only director in history to win not for his talent (Gibson has little directoral talent) but for his looks."

","The movie is excellent although the mathematical part is very difficult to present to people with minimal skills and knowledge in this field. Still the movie grabs you from the beginning mostly because of Crowe's acting. Makes you wonder if he has a screw loose himself but this aside. The only critical remark to be made is that the real story about J.F. Nash wasn't that nice like the movie. In real life Nash was scaring his co-workers because of his aggressive behaviour, probably due to his illness. There is no mention about his first wife Elisabeth with which he had his first child and who he betrayed for more then 2 years with Alicia before getting divorce. The fact that he fled to England to stay out of the mental hospital isn't even mentioned, instead he should have voluntarily admitted himself. The fact that he wondered around Princeton and bothered many professors by telephone and his obvious homosexual tendencies where also not mentioned. So in real life he was an a-social guy with aggressive, homosexual, infidel behaviour who happens to be a brilliant scientist in various mathematical fields and physics. By the way, when he got the Nobel price he thanks his wife Alicia for her support and says that without her he didn't what he did but in fact he was already divorced from Alicia by then. Can you figure that? I hope that the film makers didn't intend to make the guy look better than he was because he was an American who got awarded the Nobel price but I have my doubts about that. So for a movie it's excellent but the historical correctness it was a disaster."

"Spleen","8","0","2","20 August 2002"," Ron Howard finally makes it
","Some spoilers follow.<br/><br/>To judge from his previous films, Ron Howard doesn't like smart people much, doesn't trust intelligence as a trait and thinks little of thinking as an activity.  How did he come to present a sympathetic account of the career of a genius? However he did it, he did it; and for the first time in his career he's made a genuinely good film.<br/><br/>On the surface this is ideal material for the old Ron Howard, the director of ""Parenthood"" and ""Apollo 13"" and ""EdTV"" who longs for opportunities to sink the boot into intellectuals and urge his audience to be at least moderately stupid. Nash is mentally brilliant, yes, but that (according to a superficial analysis of what happens) is his very undoing: he suffers from schizophrenia, and is prone to both paranoid fantasies and vivid hallucinations. That's what comes of having a beautiful mind. Far better to have a dull, unattractive one. ...Only that's not what the film is saying. Nash finds away around his difficulties not because he agrees to be stupid, but because he's able to remain clever; he works out (by thinking about it) that certain of the people he sees do not in fact exist, and thinks of effective ways of ignoring them. And anyway, ARE the hallucinations and the paranoia merely manifestations of the very same mental states that allow Nash to have his mathematical insights? Not at all. Some of the other mathematicians we see are, say, half as clever as Nash, but they're not half as schizophrenic; indeed, so far as we can tell, they're not schizophrenic at all. We're also told that Nash's main problem was that his condition wasn't diagnosed until too late and that this was because he grew up and lived in an environment that ENCOURAGED paranoid delusions. If Nash had a genuinely mental failing it wasn't that he was too clever, but that in certain respects he wasn't clever enough - wasn't able to see through the flimsy Cold War propaganda which many of his contemporaries DID see through; but of course, these people were stupid in THEIR own way, as we all are.<br/><br/>But whatever the precise message, it's a good film.  (Let's pretend that the epilogue in which Nash wins the Nobel Prize wasn't included, as it shouldn't have been; it's a glaring irrelevance on the face of a movie that otherwise clearly knows what it's about.) I particularly like the rug-pulling halfway through. We know immediately that the cloak-and-dagger spycraft story isn't real; the details are just too ridiculous, and the situation is just too obviously a response to Nash's unfulfilled desire to fight communism. But the obviousness of this illusion simply helps mask the subtlety of the other one: Nash's imaginary roommate. We ought to have suspected him, for a variety of reasons. But we didn't. At least, I didn't.<br/><br/>I wish the movie hadn't dumbed down its characters' ideas so much, but it gets away with doing so because it concentrates its real attention elsewhere, and it does what it REALLY wants to do very well indeed."

","As someone who has spent some time studying the history of science, and so presumes to know a little about the circumstances from which bold new discoveries have emerged, I found this film to ring true, for the most part at least.<br/><br/>John Nash is a bold young man with the self-confidence to propose a theory that overturns 150 years of economic theory. He is ready and willing to throw out the old rules, and make up new ones. Problem is, this attitude can be dangerous: get into the habit of throwing out old views and looking at things in new ways, and you may find yourself cut loose and set adrift, bereft of a sound footing, unable to be sure of anything. After all, we can only remake our world a little at a time.<br/><br/>Of course there is no simple relation between his achievements and his mental illness, and it would be mistaken to suppose otherwise. But the movie points, persuasively I thought, in the general direction of a connection. Nash is adept at discerning patterns--in the stars, in coded signals, whatnot. He takes this talent too far in the same direction, and it is transformed from an enviable talent into a monstrosity, a symptom of mental disease. <br/><br/>The eccentric genius is after all one of our most well-entrenched clichés. And while Roger Ebert writes, in his review of this movie, that ""Nash has been compared to Newton, Mendel and Darwin, but was also for many years just a man muttering to himself in the corner,"" it happens that Newton, Mendel, Darwin themselves all did things equivalent to muttering to themselves in a corner. Obsession and its concomitant behavior seems to be a factor common to all four men."

This film was by far one of Connelly's best performences, and she deserved that oscar. Bravo! Although I should aplaud Russell Crowe, it's a waste of time, for all he does is, no offense, hog the film. I thought that both Connelly and Ed Harris's rolls were played 100x that of Crowe. The story tells of the mathematical genuis, John Nash, (Crowe), whom has the disesase schizophrenia Connelly plays his wife, Alicia Nash, and Ed Harris, whom was also in the film Pollock, and waking the dead, which also had Connelly in it, plays a man named William Parcher. Nash becomes involved in a private team sort of, and he makes words out of newspapers, magazines, anything that attracts his eye. This story is not all based on the truth, if it were, it would be a lot longer than 2 and a half hours, way longer. Also, if you wanted the truth about their relationship, here it is: Nash was threating to take all their money and run away, I think to Europe. They had four kids, all boys, and all were named, you guessed it, John. Should Ron Howard have made their relationship anything like the story, you might as well have Crowe trying to strangle Connelly every 10 minutes throughout the film. The disease is overcome, with the love and support of a caring woman, despite the fact that they are divorced, come his award. All in all, this film deserved to be best picture, Ron Howard deserved his award, and Jennifer Connelly, deserved the award for best actress in a supporting role, over anyone else, and I mean anyone.

","Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.<br/><br/>The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real. In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.<br/><br/>While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.<br/><br/>From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.<br/><br/>Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius. This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in `Gladiator', good as it was.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.<br/><br/>Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in `Pollock' (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the `Gladiator' Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, `If you can't beat him, join him', Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.<br/><br/>This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10. It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.  If you see only one motion picture this year, make sure it is this one."

My friend and I so badly wanted to believe that John Nash was okay that we kept on hoping he wasn't having delusions.  Now that's a treat.  When a director and actor can make you care that much.  I was very disappointed that Russell Crowe did not win the Academy Award.  Not that it matters all that much, politics and all.  But, when I have had friends say to me, ""Okay, now I like that Crowe character!"" all because I recommended that movie.  Well, that says it all.  One of my all-time favorites!"

","This is an extremely well-done movie. I must admit that when I started to watch it I was lost after the first little while. It didn't seem to make a lot of sense, and it was certainly not what I was expecting from everything I had heard about ""A Beautiful Mind."" But without giving anything away, let me say that even if you have the same reaction, if you stick with this you will find out why the first 45 minutes or so seems so strange. In fact, that first part of the movie is so well done that when you first watch it you're tempted to just dismiss this as a disappointingly bad movie. But don't do that. Stick with it; it's worth it.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's performance as Dr. John Nash - the brilliant Princeton mathematician who struggles his entire life with mental illness - is magnificent, and demonstrates his versatility as an actor. He portrays both Nash's brilliance and his personal angst perfectly, and brings to the screen a man whom we can all feel for. Equally powerful was the performance of Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia, whose struggle with Nash's illness is just as valiant as John's is. Connelly brings out the pain of living in this nightmare, but her love - while tested - is also the source of hope for him and eventually helps him to persevere and even triumph.<br/><br/>Moving, and at times funny (I loved Nash's line: ""what's the point of being crazy if you can't have any fun with it?"") once the story really gets going it has you questioning almost everything that happens - is it real or not? One of the few criticisms I could make would be that Christopher Plummer didn't really seem comfortable in the role of Nash's psychiatrist, Dr. Rosen. At least, that was my sense. That aside, this really is a great piece of work from Director Ron Howard.<br/><br/>8/10"

","""A Beautiful Mind"" took home four major Academy Awards for 2001. It deservedly won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay (Adaptation).<br/><br/> It is the story of John Nash who is a brilliant mathematician whose life becomes a nightmare when he descends into the scary and uncertain world of a paranoid schizophrenic. Producer Brian Grazer, Director Ron Howard and Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman show us the world of a schizophrenic from the patient's point of view as Nash's world alternates between reality and and imagined reality. The audience shares his suffering and also does not know what situations and /or characters are real or imagined.<br/><br/> Russell Crowe, in an outstanding performance, plays Nash with conviction and believability. Jennifer Connelly is his long-suffering wife Alicia who sticks with him and provides the support he so desperately needs. Christopher Plummer plays Dr. Rosen the psychiatrist who tries to help Nash. Ed Harris is excellent as Nash's contact in the Defence Department where Nash works de-coding hidden messages..or does he? Paul Bettany is Martin Hansen Nash's college roommate and Vivien Cardone his niece who Nash turns to for comfort. Adam Goldberg and Anthony Rapp are two of Nash's college classmates who he also meets from time to time over the years and who help Alicia in coping with Nash's behavior. Judd Hirsch plays Nash's college professor and watch for Roy Thinnes in a blink of an eye appearance as the Governor.<br/><br/> ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a beautiful movie, not for everyone, but a rare insight into the confusing world of a schizophrenic. A true classic."

","I was very much impressed with the acting and presentation of this movie. But, what I really want to point out is what I consider one of the most brilliant examples of slight of hand in a movie that I have ever seen.  **** minor spoiler alert ****  It is sad that we have become conditioned to stupidity in film making.  Nuclear weapons can accidentally detonate, guns never seem to run out of ammunition, the CIA can do anything, etc.  When Ron Howard presented me with a cold-war code breaking scenario involving a German nuclear bomb, I knew it was nonsense and fully accepted that something so dumb could be put into a movie by an otherwise savvy director. Of course, it turns out to not exist.  This trick very much impressed me. It showed that Ron Howard is aware that we are conditioned to stupidity and was willing to use that against us, thereby exploiting a weakness in the viewer that expands the range of illusion.  Later, he tricks us again when we realize that the illusions are not always so well telegraphed.  If was this element of A Beautiful Mind that most impressed me.  Yes, this film works on many other levels, but it took this extra stroke of brilliance to earn a 10/10 from me."

"NKMacGuffin","7","0","1","1 August 2002"," Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography
","Russell Crowe stars in the story (based on real events) of John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematics genius. In the first third of the film, we learn that Nash is brilliant, intolerant of lazy thinking, and introverted to a fault. ""I don't like other people, and they don't like me"" he remarks. His whole mind is tied to creating a 'truly original idea'. Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Ransom) goes to great lengths to show us how revolutionary and cool Nash's ideas are. Thankfully, Nash only explains himself once, and then at a suitably earthy level that everyone can understand.<br/><br/>The first half of the film feels like Good Will Hunting crossed with North By Northwest. A math genius plunged into cloak-and-dagger intrigue. Only at the midway point do we learn that there's more in Nash's (and Howard's) Mind than we thought.<br/><br/>Howard is the king of the safe, dependable movie you can safely take your parents to see. Nothing challenging, nothing revolutionary, just quality, mainstream entertainment. There's nothing remarkable here, except for another (sigh) revelatory performance from Russell Crowe. There are no great lines, no great scenes, but to watch Crowe react to the outside stimulus to his interior world. Howard draws out Nash's overactive mind through a labyrinth of mathematical notation, but we can see Nash's wheels turning in the eyes of Crowe.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly (Pollock, Requiem for a Dream), in her highest profile role of her career, is splendid as Nash's wife and only connection to the real world. She is an intelligent, educated woman who loves Nash's heart over his mind. Her character is well-formed on the page, and she plays the conflicts between the heart and mind, the real world and the metaphysical, with grace.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is Ed Harris. Always superb (Pollock, Apollo 13), he does a fine job as a G-man doggedly pursuing Nash's genius for the good of the country. In his 1940's spook suit, he looks tough and mean enough to beat up Humphrey Bogart.<br/><br/>The movie has the potential to be excellent, but steps back into very good territory in the last third. When making a biopic of a real person (Nash is alive and well) you must choose whether to tell THE story OF a man's life, or A story IN a man's life. Howard tries for both and the movie suffers for it. Once Nash conquers his struggles, the film continues for (what feels like) twenty minutes, covering the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties. This incredibly boring section is necessary to get us to a 1994 Nobel Prize nomination, and a completely fictional acceptance speech. The story IN his life was over decades earlier. If Nash were a fictional character, these 20 minutes would never have made the final cut. Howard felt the need (out of respect) to conclude the movie on the best, happiest, and least ambiguous note possible. No doubt can be left in the viewer's mind that everything turned out okay.<br/><br/>Crowe shines in this otherwise solid, workmanlike biography. You can always count on Howard for quality product, but it wouldn't hurt the film to trim a little."

Although Crowe did a good job overall, his West Virginia accent was very poor and at times he lapsed back into his native Kiwi accent.  Many times he attempted to cover his poor accent by mumbling his lines. Denzel Washington definitely deserved to win the Oscar over Crowe.

I thought Russell Crowe was decent in spite of Howard, and that Jennifer Connelly turned some dopey lines into a decent role. But despite all the polish, and a few enjoyable scenes, the story was hopelessly flawed. The work that got him the Nobel got barely a nod early on in the film, the love story which supposedly drives this was developed inadequately, etc. Perhaps Howard couldn't get any subtlety or depth because he was hamstrung by a merely adequate screenplay. I think, though, that subtlety, depth, and passion are beyond his reach.<br/><br/>As bland as it was, it was still decent, and I'd probably give it a 7 out of 10 if I were in a good mood, but it was not really worthy of that Oscar, especially in a year when an achievement as magnificent as LOTR was up against it."

(Those who have seen this film will understand my analogy)Briefly: ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I woke up once from a really strange dream. My eyes had been open while I was taking an afternoon nap, and I was looking in the direction of a framed picture of a Corvette on my bedroom wall. In this very vivid dream, there were some of my friends dancing, singing and laughing all around the car. I suddenly woke up from that nap, still looking at the poster. The car remained, but the people were gone. The singing and clapping faded to the dull roar of my fan. The realization that my brain, through simple dreaming, was adding life and motion to the picture on my wall gave me an eerie chill that I could not explain, and would only experience again when I saw this movie. When Mrs. Nash begins investigating the places we first see in the film through the eyes (and mind) of a very awake and conscious John Nash, there's a charge of emotion that, in an instant, ranges from compassion to sheer wonder. Particularly when she finds the ""communications shack"". Goosebumps! The complexities of the human mind may not be explainable with words; but, through the real magic of cinema, Ron Howard and Russell Crowe (and all others who made this movie, gaffer, key grip and all) seem to have hit it right on the bull's eye!

Russell Crowe is pure excellence  this should have won him his best actor award not Gladiator. I thought Jennifer Connelly was captivating. She has grown up to be a great actress.

"Ralphie Boy","Null","0","1","10 July 2002"," Opie disappoints
","While the Missus was moved to tears, I was only vaguely engaged by any of BEAUTIFUL MIND, and that was wholly due to Crowe's performance, which was, as always, superb. His over-the-top rendering of a man with a mental illness is right in the RAINMAN-AWAKENINGS-FORREST GUMP school of star vehicles and he does not disappoint. Russell Crowe is an old-time Hollywood movie star. And that's not intended as an insult.<br/><br/>My problem with BM (did I just say that?) is not that I felt ""manipulated"" or ""cheated"" or lied to by Opie in the telling of the story, which is a complaint I've heard from others who compare the movie (unfavorably) to SIXTH SENSE. Hell. ALL stories are manipulative. It's just that the good ones do it with the curtains more firmly drawn.<br/><br/>No, my problem was the structure of the narrative. Essentially, none of the movie's three acts sync up very well, and their very different tones and styles resulted in very different levels of involvement for me at different points throughout the film.<br/><br/>Act I is the deranged genius finding his ""great idea"" at Princeton. I liked this part very much. It smacks of all the great many ""genius"" movies, as a strange outsider wins a place in the world by seeing through it to the ""governing dynamics"" that rule it. LITTLE MAN TATE. SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISHER. GOOD WILL HUNTING. Lots of Ken Russell films, and others I can't think of at this moment.<br/><br/>Act II, which begins with his job at MIT, is a cold-war/code-breaking thriller, with a building, creepy sense of paranoia and unreality in what is supposed to be a true story. So, despite Crowe's magnetic portrayal, I was profoundly distanced by what seemed like a genre treatment of a man's actual life, especially as it followed the ""realism"" of Act I.<br/><br/>Crowe falls in love with and marries the beautiful, compassionate and slightly odd Jennifer Connolly (after all, who wouldn't?), but I never bought into this relationship. I just couldn't see what she saw in him. But, that's probably because I didn't think Connolly was all that convincing, despite her classical beauty. She suffers from LTS. Liv Tyler Syndrome. Also, the script doesn't give us much reason to see very deeply into a love that must eventually overcome the most daunting obstacles in Act III, and become the hook on which this whole concoction must hang.  Opie is requiring the one scene of Crowe `drawing' pictures in the stars for Connolly to carry the entire weight of this `magical' relationship, and it buckles under the tonnage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Act III begins with the big ""reveal"" in the mental hospital about Nash's delusions, and you realize you've been watching a false story for about an 1 hour and a half, which breeds in the viewer either resentment or admiration toward the film. In either case, whatever your reaction, you are now in a different movie for the last 30-40 minutes, and the gear change is a grinding from which I never recovered.<br/><br/>We now watch as a mentally ill man faces the challenge of overcoming insurmountable obstacles, which he does through the love of a good woman. Sniff, sniff.<br/><br/>Now, look. I'm as big a sucker as anybody for the ""love conquers all"" motif. But that kind of thing has to be set up from the beginning, and every fiber of the film has to echo it. PRELUDE TO A KISS comes to mind. Or, In PRINCESS BRIDE, where not only is the story-within-the-story about ""true love"", but the framing device of the grandfather reading to his sick grandchild echoes that theme as well. ""As you wish"". indeed. It has got to have a magical quality of transcendence to work right in a story.<br/><br/>In BM, though, we don't even MEET the love interest until Act 2, just under halfway thru the movie. And, right after the courtship and marriage, we're caught up in all the espionage nonsense. All we see then is the hell their relationship has become, and his institutionalization, and the aftermath played out in Act 3. He almost drowns their baby, for chrissakes! And I'm supposed to cheer that she decides to stay with him? Why? Because he's SMART?  Because theirs is a wonderful love story? Who says?<br/><br/>The speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony struck a patently false note, as Opie tries to tie up all the threads of the movie into a love story that is wholly undeveloped, with an ending that is wholly unearned. In fact, the most moving and real moments in the movie for me were (1) where he says good-bye to his ""little girl"" delusion, and (2) where he receives pens from his colleagues in the dining room at Princeton.<br/><br/>The ""little girl"" thing just struck me on a personal level, as I related it to saying goodbye forever to my own daughter. The ""pen scene', though, is the essential core of the story. It's about a guy who wanted RECOGNITION for his genius, at whatever the cost, because without that he was just a deranged West Virginian with no social skills whose life was utterly meaningless. And after a lifetime of pain and suffering, both endured and inflicted, he finally gets that recognition. Well. good for him. But is that a ""want"" worthy of a story's protagonist? I don't know. `Attention must be paid' was certainly good enough motivation for Willy Loman. Of course, Willy DIES at the end, and DEATH OF A SALESMAN is a TRAGEDY wherein we mourn a man who wanted the wrong things out of life, and not a `feel good'/Hollywood movie intending to CELEBRATE Loman's life (well, it might be if filmed today, but that's another story.).<br/><br/>As I said, my wife liked it, and I didn't hate it. Which doesn't suck on a Saturday night, when the sitter is watching the kids.  I just don't see what the big deal is about this very flawed movie, shifting as it does from narrative to narrative, without really engaging me on any level for any sustained period.<br/><br/>Opie does much better with more straightforward unambiguous material, like APOLLO 13. Stories that require more abstract, shaded, ambivalent qualities are just out of his range, I think."

","While this film was certainly a well refined, polished product of the Hollywood film machine, I felt that it lacked real depth and purpose. There is nothing necessarily wrong with a film made to please audiences; it's the fact that this one insists on taking itself so seriously that irks me. Russell Crowe turned out a reasonably impressive performance, but If you want to see Jennifer Connelly show off her acting abilities to a far greater extent I'd recommend ""Requiem for a Dream"". The dialogue was slightly stiff and cliched, and the actual facts of the story were strained almost beyond recognition. However, the real flaw does not lie within the film itself, but rather the hype surrounding it. ""A Beautiful Mind"" has been purported to be a great film of mind altering proportions, when in reality it is merely another flimsy product of audience appeasement. ""A Beautiful Mind"" has no more depth than ""Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"", although the latter surely lacks the arrogance."

However, one of the people that went with us said' ""It was ok, but the dinosaurs looked fake."" I guess it is because people focus on the wrong details. This film isn't really a love story (although the end might persuade you to think that). It is truly a story about mental illness, and it attempts to take the audience on a guided tour inside the mind of a paranoid-schizophrenic.  I believe it handled this well, although there are flaws (no film is perfect).  I'm sure it wasn't all that faithful to the real John Nash, but it did show that sometimes there is no ""magical"" pill or cure; defeating our demons can take a lifetime to achieve.

Winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. Also Nominated for Best Actor, Best Score, and Best Makeup. Russell Crowe stars in an amazing performance as the brilliant mathematician John F. Nash. John isn't social, isn't really popular, and definetly not great with the ladies. But, he is gifted with a brilliant mind. He solves equation after equation looking for an original idea to become well known and respected. He's well on is way, and is successful. Life is perfect. Until he is hired by William Parcher (played by Academy Award nominee Ed Harris)to break codes during a Russian conspiracy. Everything is going well until he makes a shocking discovery that it is all fake. The conspiracy, his roommate who he befriends, and the roommate's adorable niece. All fake. Schizophrenia has taken over his life.  His wife is the only thing that can help him get threw this. Alicia (Academy Award Winner (for this) Jennifer Connelly) is there with him threw the hospitalizations, the struggles, the good times, but more the bad. She sticks with him, and thanks to her, John is able to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. Jennifer Connelly's performance was nothing short of brilliant. She is luminous and exquisite.  The Oscar was well deserved. You can truly see her struggle to help her husband, to raise her son, and to stay sane herself. And, Russell Crowe, Russell Crowe. Only nominated this year for Best Actor (beaten out by Denzel Washington for ""Training Day"". Personally, I thought Russell was better!), Russell is still is as good as he has ever been. Truly amazing. He makes you cry, laugh, and cheer at the end. Russell's best performance to date!

","(SPOILERS) To Russell Crowe's credit, he resists the temptation to wallow in Akiva Goldman's overwrought, pseudo-Greek tragedy of a script to deliver a fairly compelling performance.  Nash's story IS compelling; however, Ron Howard (director) misses every opportunity to tell it or interpret it. Again and again, he resorts to safe, traditional, manipulative, Hollywood direction and refuses to enter Nash's mind and relay his experience in a visual or metaphorical way (refer to Aronofsky's brilliant ""Pi"").  We are instead given car chases, conspiracy theories, imaginary friends, sentimental scenes with fountain pens, but alas, no interesting camera work. That's a pity.  Roger Deakins' cinematography (with the Coen Brothers, for instance) is usually astonishing. Here, it's merely serviceable.  Howard reigned Deakins in for all the wrong reasons.

","(Possible spoiler)<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this film in its story telling ability.  Ron Howard evidently did an excellent job of directing.   However, the story is largely fantasy, as John Nash didn't have the kind of delusions that the film has him experiencing.  (He didn't see imaginary room mates and government spooks, but rather he heard voices from aliens.)  Adding to that, the lack of dealing with the ""bad"" side of his life (alleged homosexuality and anti-semitism, his wife divorcing him, etc)...  I think the movie was rather dishonest as a portrayal of a real person.  If it was promoted as a fictional story of a man dealing with mental illness, it would have been much better.   As it was, it was just another example of Hollywood distorting the truth in order to make a movie that sells tickets and wins awards.<br/><br/>I think Mr. Crowe did an excellent job of acting, but again, the dishonesty of this film shows itself.   John Nash was a West Virginian for goodness sake, so why couldn't a great actor like Crowe learn to speak like a West Virginian (or at least an American) for this role?  His Australian accent was all too apparent throughout the movie.   In scenes where a West Virginia drawl was attempted, it wasn't convincing at all.  It can be done, after all:  just look at Orlando Bloom's portrayal of an American soldier in Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, as it will make you think about the effects of mental illness on a person's life and career.

"mikestollov","7","0","1","30 June 2002"," Delusional mathematician=interesting, Sane=Boring
","Spoilers Alert Ron Howard's best work yet is not without it's flaws. The story of John Nash is no doubt a difficult story to tackle, after all he developed the ""Game Theory"" of economics which I read about & which gave me headaches for weeks after. Representing that in the film in any sort of depth would be very hard to do without alienating a vast population of cinema goers, although complex mathematical problems have been represented in an understandable & entertaining way before (most notably with the efforts of British code breakers & cracking the Nazi Enigma cyphers).<br/><br/>Here's the dilemma then, as Russell Crowe's mumbling Nash descends into delusions the story is interesting. Ed Harris is spooky as the ""Big Brother"" character called Parcher, who works in a world of spies & espionage. The slide from reality to unreality is very well done, you really can't tell that Nash has slipped his leash & wandered off into increasingly paranoid delusions unless you know the story already. From then on it's an occasionaly fast paced plot about breaking Russian codes, tracking suitcased sized atomic bombs that are being routed across the US by a radical faction of the Soviet military. All very James Bond & there's plenty to keep you glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The reality takes a back seat, to the extent that you wonder just what on earth the world was doing to allow Nash to keep working in his lofty position while all this hallucination was going on. Now I can understand that you only have so much time, so much story line to devote & that avenues are explored at the expense of others, but if you don't know what John Nash's accomplishments were (his ""Game Theory"" revolutionised economics) then you spend the rest of the film confused. Although his new theory is mentioned, a result of his university search for a completely original area of maths, only at the end is a passing reference made to the importance of his breakthrough. In fact I know some people who think that his unequaled contribution to the world & the reason why he was in such a good job, was the breaking of the above mentioned Soviet codes! This is an indication of how confusing the story can be & I know that it needs to be shown that Nash was delusional, but not at the risk of having the audience lose the plot!<br/><br/>All this is due to the overstating of his delusional world, which is cleverly done, but there's far too much smoke & mirrors for the real story to emerge. For instance it is well into the second half of the film that you find out that his college room mate Charles (Paul Bettanay) is actually an illusion. This is skillfully done, it has to be said (the scene in Dr Rosen's (Christopher Plummer) office), but by then you have to sit & think far too much about dominant plot lines that have happened before. I'm all for films making you think, rather than the force fed cotton candy rubbish of Spielberg or Brockheimer, but I found the phase change too confusing. There really should have been a few more clues to build suspicion in the viewing public's mind.<br/><br/>There are some hints. For instance there are several characters that never interact with the real world. They also never age, a vital point to Nash's eventual recognition of his illness & the way in which he managed to live with it. But it's far too subtle, to the point where the hints fade into obscurity & the importance is lost.<br/><br/>Of course you go, ""Ooohhh' & ""Aaahhhh"" when the truth is revealed, but then we have the second problem, we're back to dry reality & nothing interesting happens. It becomes a life struggle, a unique story non the less, as I don't know how many people have overcome their paranoid delusions simply by applying their on intelect. But rapidly it settles into well worn tracks that are dusted off yet again. Triumph over adversity, love conquers all, the value of friendship, blah blah blah. Iwas left thinking that having Parcher around was better!<br/><br/>A final criticism revolves around the sound. Many years ago when Al Pacino & Robert Deniro came along we had a terrible series of ""mumbling"" films, where you couldn't hear what on earth people were saying. This film is bordering on the same, with one minute explosions of sound, followed by long periods of ""what did he say????"". With modern sound production techniques there really is no excuse.<br/><br/>Visually it is absolutely flawless, the cinematography flows without effort & the eye is constantly at ease with what is being shown. I like that, it's the way it should be. The music is well sorted out too, setting the mood very well without being obtrusive. This isn't a high octane thriller, so we're treated to a background sound track that stays there, adding to the flavour perfectly.<br/><br/>The actors are also wonderful, although Russel Crowe mumbles far too much, as I said. Ed Harris is teriffic as the government spook, Parcher, fitting the 1950s suit & hat with a combination of attention holding aura & chilling malice. Jennifer Connelly is the long suffering wife, a part that doesn't give her much room for development, but she gets to flesh the part out as much as she can (like I said, some aspects of Nash's life get trimmed as the delusional world takes up so much time). Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist Dr Rosen is a little disturbing, the line where he forciably takes Nash into hospital is somethign like ""I just want to talk with you"", which you know means he's going to actually lock him up. None the less it's good to see Plummer still getting work & doing it very well indeed.<br/><br/>One final point surrounds Nash's sexual preferences. I've heard from several gay that Nash went both ways, with a preference for men & that this wasn't shown. I've no idea how true this is, but if it is the case I don't think it's very fair to leave this out. After all if it's OK to have the subject of severe mental illness raised, why not his sexual orientation? Others, those who are more informed ont he subject, will have to explore that avenue."

It was especially the title that made me think it wouldn't be very successful. I mean, ""A Beautiful Mind""? Come ON.<br/><br/>
Well, I first started realizing I was wrong when I heard it was big at the box office, and then when I heard it had won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. But by the night of the Oscars, I was my skeptical self again. I wanted Ron Howard to win Best Director, and I didn't care if it won Best Picture, but no matter what, I did NOT want Russell Crowe to win Best Actor. I'm not sure why, but it's probably because I'm not crazy about him, since I heard what he did to the person who cut his speech short. And he didn't win.<br/><br/>Finally, a few nights ago, I decided to see this Best-Pic winner that critics were calling ""moving"" and ""powerful,"" so I rented it--and was taken aback. I was shocked. I couldn't believe I had ever doubted this movie before I saw it. First, I'll get over with saying what's NOT good about it: It does feel full of itself, if you know what I mean. <br/><br/>Now for what IS good: The makeup--they had to make the actors look older, and did a nice job. The musical score--at times it could be annoying, but most of the time I liked the mysterious music that set the tone of a somewhat mysterious film. The acting--need I say more? I admit Russell Crowe gave one of the best performances of his career, and although his accent slipped more than once, I believed him. And Ed Harris was a good addition to the cast--(MAJOR SPOILER)he seemed like a good guy, but got freakier as you realize he's not real. <br/><br/>But the true standout performance, according to the Academy and me, was not Russell, not Ed, not even Christopher Plummer as the doctor who diagnoses John Nash with schizophrenia, but Jennifer Connelly. She's a beautiful and very powerful actress, and really made a name for herself with ""A Beautiful Mind""--not just by winning the Oscar, but simply by playing Alicia Nash. I believed every second of her performance (except maybe the whole bathroom mirror scene; that looked a little phony), and although most probably didn't buy the ""this is real"" line, I did, and I'm not sensitive when it comes to movies. <br/><br/>The only type of person who WOULDN'T enjoy ""A Beautiful Mind"" would probably be the type that doesn't appreciate a touching, believable drama with excellent directing and wonderful acting...and there are a few goofs to look for, so nit-pickers like me might enjoy hunting for them. However, go for Crowe's performance--or Connelly's if you still aren't convinced------------------8/10"

","I had to get by Russell Crowe's media personality to actually get it up to see this movie.  I'm glad I did.  He is absolutely fabulous in this movie and truly is one very fine actor.  Of course, it helps working in a movie that is well directed, well edited, and very well written.  Doesn't follow any ""formulas"" of which I am aware and wound up telling quite an unusual story in a very interesting manner.  Jennifer Connelly was excellent as John Nash's incredibly tolerant wife.  She could show you the love she had for him and the pain their circumstances brought her as well.  Paul Bettany as Charles was a lively contrast to Nash's down-trodden personality. Intelligent, interesting, and entertaining.  One fine movie.  A must see."

","Amazing, beautiful, touching, interesting.<br/><br/>These words can be used to describe A Beautiful Mind. I went to see this movie just because I hadn't yet and my father and I were out having a movie day to take in as many theatrical releases as we could.<br/><br/>From the time the score started (which was about the time the Universal logo appears on the screen) I knew that this movie was my type of movie.<br/><br/>First, the score: James Horner has finally outdone himself. As the master of rich, dark, beautiful, music, they could not have picked a better composer to score the film.<br/><br/>The thing that I was most impressed with in this film was Crowe's performance as John Nash. Although he did not act exactly like John Nash, he certainly didn't act like his typical tough-but-sensitive character. His acting was brilliant.<br/><br/>I was not sure exactly who Jennifer Connelly was, but after a little research I found out that she was the start in the old Lucio Fulci horror masterpiece Phenomena (a.k.a Creepers) and I had such a crush on her when I was around 12 or so. Her performance was stellar as well, but somewhat lack-luster next to Crowe's. I have seen I think all of Ed Harris' movies and though I think he is pretty good at acting, I can't see what all of the fuss is about. Did anyone see The Stand? Small part for such a huge actor, don't you think?<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this movie as #2 on my all time favorites, second only to Shawshank Redemption.

","I have viewed ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few times now and I can say with great confidence that in addition to being a tremendous piece of drama, Russell Crowe gives one of the great acting performances I have ever seen.  Many films have been made with actors aging quite convincingly, but no 30-something-year-old has ever pulled off the aging process better.  Watch the scene where Russell is given the Nobel at Princeton.  As a man now in his seventies, his speech to the committee rep is masterful;  no contemporary actor commands the screen like Crowe.  This movie owes a great deal of its success to its lead.<br/><br/>In the tradition of great films, Mind also benefits from strong supporting acting with the likes of Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, and a thankless, yet crucial role by the always great Ed Harris.  As good as some of Ron Howard's films have been (Apollo 13, Parenthood), he buries the quality of his previous work with this one.  Kudos to those that had faith that a movie about an antisocial mathematician's life could be so engaging and moving.  The only disappointment for me was witnessing the politics that robbed Crowe of his Oscar.  You will be hard pressed to find a better performance in any film."

","I cannot begin to  describe the level of disappointment that this highly hyped film brought. Crowe was absolutely unbelievable as a West Virginian, or as a Mathematician. As a victim of schizophrenia, he succeeds.<br/><br/>
One of the problems with truth based film is that we have to really believe the story and in this one even the truth is difficult to swallow because it is so far removed from ordinary experience. I suppose that audiences like the film because Nash ultimately gains recognition and ends up proving that mental illness can be kicked by picking oneself up by their bootstraps which is perhaps the most dangerous sentiment of the movie and a reason in and of itself why the movie should be avoided. I felt pity for the character that was and is John Nash but couldn't see beyond Maximus for much of the film. When Crowe takes of his shirt he takes off the only pretense of the young mathematician.<br/><br/>In the final part of the movie the make up is superb and one even feels that Crowe is finally able to throw off his ""hunk"" image and get into the character.

"yellowcherry","5","0","1","25 June 2002"," This film left me disappointed.
","My friends highly recommended ""A Beautiful Mind,"" saying that it was a great movie that left some of them bawling at the end. However, I failed to see why this film has gathered so much praise and is being hailed as one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe did perform well and convincingly portrayed a ""crazy"" man. However, I felt no emotion throughout the film and only teared up when I saw that poor imaginary girl cry. Anything can make me cry...but only the sight of the little innocent face was able to evoke my tears in this work. I observed the struggles and pain that Alicia Nash had to endure but the film still failed to emotionally involve me. Occasionally, I wondered when the film would end as it seemed to drag on. The screenplay didn't seem spectacular and the film could have done a better job conveying the actual importance of Nash's accomplishments. From just watching the film, I didn't really understand why Nash received the Nobel Prize or what it was that made Mr. Nash so special. Maybe Akiva Goldsman's intention was to focus on the ""power of love"" during difficult times. Nash's character needed more definition and development as the film's drama was just like any other old drama in other films. The only difference that this film had from others was that it had a schizophrenic based on a true character and a younger wife suffering from the marriage she entered. Basically, I view it as a love story with a total of three scenes of flirting and then a woman having to put up with her psycho husband - who ends up smacking her down by accident and nearly drowning their baby. That was it. Oh yeah, the woman sticks with him for forty years that the audience barely gets to see. As for the main character, he makes some hilarious remarks, scribbles furiously, observes pigeons, cuts up magazines, gradually descends into madness, fights the Russians in his mind, takes steps toward improvement, gets himself into a hospital, digs his way into his arm searching for a mysterious code implant, ignores his imaginary friends, and then wins the Nobel Prize. Great! Just great. There was just something missing in that mix that would have made it more appealing to me. If it was supposed to be capitalizing on the Nashs' struggles, it could have had stronger and more developed relations/scenes between John and Alicia. A little more background on both of the characters would not have hurt as it was already so long. At the end, I was alarmed that Nash had already became so old. I was worried that I had missed the good part and anxiously awaited the last scenes. Was the scene where he got all of those pens supposed to make me cry? Why was he so respected again? The film never really told me.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was ...average. The few moments of comedy was actually better than the slow and unengaging drama that made my head hurt. I don't know anything more about John Nash than I did before I viewed the film. It doesn't deserve to be in the top 250."

As I watched it I realized that this is, at least, the fifth modern film to use apparitions or schizophrenia to create a surprise.  ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Others"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". All have been made in recent years, all use the same devices, and all used them much better than ""A Beautiful Mind"".  I'm getting tired of it as it nears creating it's own genre of ""Suprise"" filmmaking.<br/><br/>Ron Howard does an excellent job directing as usual and the acting was good, as expected... not wonderful or perfect.  I suggest you see ""Rain Man"", ""Sling Blade"" or ""Regarding Henry"" if you fancy a brilliant actor playing the role of a handicap.<br/><br/>The thing I didn't enjoy was that this movie never really decided what kind of film it wanted to be.  You begin to attach yourself to Nash and then suddenly his wife takes over as the object of the movie.. and she shouldn't be.  It's like Nash wants it to be an ""October Sky"" about discovery and merit and then this wife wants it to be a bad romance novel about love.  I adore a good love story, don't get me wrong, but this movie wasn't a love story, nor was it about overcoming one's odds.. it was a horrible incomplete attempt at homogenizing these things.

I don't agree  with the people who were upset over all of his life not being included, inlcuding suggestions that Nash had homosexual relationships.  This is a work of fiction, not a biography or documentary.

I don't particularly care for him, but I can certainly respect his brilliant portrayal of the schizophrenic mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr.  While Howard glosses over the more displeasing character traits of Nash a la The Hurricane, traits which include alleged Anti-Semitism, it's not his movie.  Crowe owns the screen, and, being in virtually every scene, he elevates what could have been a tale of a man's struggle with a severe mental illness he can't deal with, and the people that stuck with him, into something that, while not approaching art, is heart-wrenching, with a predictable, but nonetheless welcomed happy ending.  I find it difficult to understand how this film earned Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, yet failed to garner one for the man who made the effort worthwhile.  Yet, Hollywood loves mental illness.  From Forrest Gump, to Rain Man, to Charly, films about heart over mind seem to never get old with the judges at the Oscars. I feel that this is as good a film as could have been made about this character, almost entirely due to Crowe, without becoming distant to the viewer.  Do we really want to know about Nash's Anti-Semitism?  Not really, no.  A Beautiful Mind will always appear to me a film that made a campaign at the academy awards, and robbed a far superior film of it's honor.  But it's definitely worth seeing."

","Spoilers.  I got into this movie because I felt for the main character, Russell Crow.  I, for one, did not know anything of his mental disorder when I first saw this movie.  I knew that he had one, but not what kind. So, I'm watching the movie and thinking, ""Ok, this is the story of a life of a man who worked for the government doing spy work and was always in constant danger.""  I was scared when the people who he thought were Russians finally caught them and of course I didn't believe them when they said that he was in a phsychiatric hospital, but the more that I put the pieces together, the more it made sense.  It was creepy in my mind when his wife goes back to where he left all those letters and unfathomable to me how a man can imagine everything that he saw and pass it off as true.  It must be a truly frightening life style to live not knowing what is real and what is imaginary.  Somehow, though, he overcame all these obstacles.  This is a great movie, but it loses one point because the part about the Nobel Prize at the end was unnecesary and I thought was just added in there to make it a feel good ending.  I know its a biography, but you don't have to include everything.<br/><br/>9/10"

Unlike most biographies, the movie doesn't come off as a series of vignettes from the subject's life, it's all tied together very nicely and cleanly.

","I wanted to believe this movie was sorta of like the real people that it is based on, but it isn't.  This movie got three things right that I have to put in its defense.  One, the names Alicia and John F. Nash, two, John F. Nash did win the Pultizer Prize in Economics, and three John F. Nash does have schizophrenia and conquered the mental disorder  by what he calls ""diet"". Other then that this movie is that, A MOVIE.  Reading the book, A Beautiful Mind, a person learns more about the real true John F. Nash and Alicia Nash.  When a person reads the book they find that it paints Nash in a different light then the movie does.  This movie should have been wrote about a different person then the real one because it would have worked out better.  I was extermely surprised and sadden too because of what is revealed.  The movie is good as long as you think that John F. Nash is just a character.  Even though in the credits the movie is based on the book it is very loosely based.   There should have been a warning label with this movie due to the unrealistic details it has about its protagonist."

","It's a dissapointment that the Oscar voters picked this as Best Picture, a film as ponderous as Crowe's burly physique. Because just about the only light moments in the story occur when his schizophrenic condition is used to draw laughs. So, if twisted logic is applied here, the sense of humour John Nash (Russell Crowe) is portrayed to possess is probably also delusional.<br/><br/>Ron Howard as Best Director for this? You just wonder why. He has not bothered to flesh out the real supporting characters other than Nash's wife (played by Jennifer Connelly, with more insightful performances); it's a curious point that the three people who only exist in Nash's mind affect him more than the real ones. Lord of The Rings and Amelie should have a better chance (of winning Best Picture) as they have better characterisation of the roles and deeper meaning of structure. <br/><br/>It's also weirdly remarkable that Crowe plays an older, beaten man more comfortably and believably than he does a sociopathic and arrogant young math genius (hah!) considering his real-life behaviour and attitude. 3 years ago, Crowe did an overall better job in The Insider.<br/><br/>Kudos to the make-up artist who aged Crowe, and that's about.

","The year 2001 brought us movie lovers some excellent titles to watch. A Beautiful Mind can be placed along that names, on my opinion. It´s a realistic psychologic movie about a man who´s suffering from schizofrenia. There are a couple of thing that makes this movie great. First of all, the movie makes you understand a little bit how someone who has schizofrenia experience the world. Second, the two leading actors performance (Nash-Russel Crowe-and his wife) is really outstanding. By my opinion Crowe deserved a second Oscar for this performance. The third reason this movie is excellent is that the movie really does something with you; watching this movie certainly should be an emotional experience witch takes you in the life of John Nash, former Nobel price winner. Last, it´s a true story, which gave me an extra dimension to this movie. So, I can recommend this movie to anyone who´s kind of good movies, with a great script and excellent actor´s performances.

"dgoody","8","0","1","9 May 2002"," Lives up to the hype
","Life is a long, subtle and complex entity riddled with ambiguity and questions, without neat little dividers or convenient scenes. In short it is often a frustrating and confusing experience, which is one of the reasons why motion pictures have become as successful and as ubiquitous as they have, because they offer an escape from the problematic nature of our circumstances and allow us to dream for a few hours.<br/><br/>If you wish to see a balanced and intelligent portrayal of either the life of nobel prize winner John Nash or the effects of Schizophrenia then A Beautiful Mind should be well down your list, if even on it at all. However if you want 2 hours of well produced and well acted drama, and have it in you to forgive a few oversights then Ron Howard's multi Oscar winner succeeds.<br/><br/>The film follows the life of John Nash from his obsessive and turbulent time at Princeton university where he writes a groundbreaking paper on an economics related subject, through to his study at Wheeler labs where he becomes embroiled in top secret government work as delusions start to take over his life.<br/><br/>The strength of A Beautiful Mind is in how powerfully it evokes Nash's delusions, to the extent that you not only starting questioning exactly who around him is real, but wishing that some of his fantasies really were real, and as such, if you let it, the film draws you into the characters tortured world, where he is torn between impossible decisions because of his confused judgements.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent and aided by the scripts wise decision to restrict tearful emotive speeches to a minimum instead of soliloquising the audience into submission. The supporting roles from Ed Harris and Paul Bethany are crucial and well delivered. Even Russell Crowe's Forrest Gump accent is forgivable due to the general restraint shown in a part that most people would have showboated throughout in. Whilst it still pales next to his remarkable performance in The Insider, this confirms that Russell Crowe's ability remains undiminished by the corrupting effects of Hollywood stardom.<br/><br/>Where the superficially similar Iris struggled to impress with an intricate flashback structure and dreamy abstract visuals Ron Howard keeps things relative basic, with only some fairy dust special effects trying to add a little too much saccharine to the tale (whenever Nash cracks a code it seems as if Tinkerbell is pointing the way for him with the amount of sparkles on the screen). The result of this is that whilst A Beautiful Mind may function only on a simple and restricted level, with little for the intellect or artistic eye to feast upon, it succeeds as potent storytelling where the performances and direction do their best not to obstruct or inhibit the fingers of the film plucking at heartstrings, which is what has made American cinema the most popular in the world."

","(a review to be read in conjunction with others - I'm not going to rehash synopsis and such)<br/><br/>Having read Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Nash (same title), on which the film was loosely based, I was quite turned off by the trailer for this film (as other IMDbers have been).<br/><br/>Luckily, the trailer was just a sad attempt at selling the film to audiences who would probably hate it anyway. A Beautiful Mind is an exceptionally classy film, by Hollywood standards. It's on the same level as Cast Away, both films having first-rate directors and casts.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe has the tricky job of portraying a man who is a lot more comfortable within his mind than in relating to the rest of the world, and making us care about and empathize with him. And he pulls it off so well that to understand it you will simply have to see the film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is just right for John Nash's wife, Alicia. What a shame that such an intelligent, beautiful actress has been consigned to so many junky parts in the last decade. Hopefully this will give her a bit more good notice.<br/><br/>Everyone else is good, too, especially Ed Harris, but to explain further I'd have to spoil.<br/><br/>Reviewers have criticized Ron Howard for straying dramatically from the story's biographical source, but then they would also bust him if he stuck too close to the book. The preponderance of changes can be fairly defended as reasonable attempts to bring things from the page to the screen, where people can visualize them. (Books have the advantage of not working in a limited timeframe).<br/><br/>Why only ""nearly great,"" when everyone seems to be shouting ""Oscar!"" for Russ or Jen or Ron? Firstly, the music. I've never thought especially much of James Horner's conventional, boring scores and this one is especially disappointing. A more creative composer could have written something that would literally underscore the compelling emotional content of the film.<br/><br/>Then, there a few spots, notably the end, in which nuance is thrown out the window (for a car chase or heartstring-pulling moments).

The movie pulls no punches- we see his wife's frustration and sense of duty in sticking  with a man who is not well.  In a sense, this movie is about ""Till death do us part"", and about a woman who took that seriously, even though the man she married was no longer there.  She married a dashing brilliant young professor, and was left shortly thereafter with a dangerous, surly delusional.  <br/><br/>   The movie will surprise you, frighten you, at times will warm your heart.

The film tackles mental illness with subtlety and yet at the same time with a great deal of power without sensationalizing its subject.  I was moved at the boundaries between illusion and reality and was relieved to finally know which was which.  But most importantly, this is a love story.  John Nash would not have been able to overcome his problems without his wife, Alicia.  She was the foundation for his return to functional life.  The espionage angle is quick, shallow and perfect for tying in the film's real meaning.

","`A Beautiful Mind' <br/><br/>4 *'s out of 4<br/><br/>Reviewed by Matt Doolittle<br/><br/>
	`A Beautiful Mind' is a touching story of the life of Professor John Nash. It stars Russell Crowe as John Nash and starts off in college where John Nash is trying to come up with something to get him into an internship at a prestigious university.  He comes up with his theory and gets in.  We then take a trip through time to John in his occupation as a college professor/code breaker for the pentagon.<br/><br/>(If you have not seen this movie and plan on seeing it, I urge you to please stop here-spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>He then meets up with a government officer named Parcher who tells him that the government needs him to brake codes so that they can find out information on a Russian bomb.  Nash agrees and starts working for the government breaking codes in magazines while keeping his other job as a math professor, or so he thinks. He is captured by who every one including him thinks are Russian spies when in reality they are psychiatrists who are trying to help him.  We then find out that John has schizophrenia and people he has met including Parcher do not really exist.<br/><br/>This is a touching film in which Russell Crowe is Oscar-worthy and every one does a great job.  I was stunned when I saw who was the director of this film. I have to admit Ron Howard did a marvelous job with this film and I dare to say I forgive him for `The Grinch' last year, as well as all of the other flops he has directed.  Finally a great film that is not only for the critics, but also for anyone who enjoys going to the movies.  I did not talk to anyone who was disappointed in this film. <br/><br/>The actors, director, music, story line, and audience interaction are all as close to perfect as you can get.  Again Ron Howard did a great job; Russell Crowe is inspirational as well as the rest of the cast.  There is not a boring second in this film and the plot is beautifully written.  John Nash is an inspiration to the whole audience and Alicia Nash is astonishing.  The things she had to put up with and the things she did make her character not only interesting but also looked up to.  If you did not enjoy this film then I urge you to see it again, I think you will change your mind."

","I have to say this is one of those feel good movies but it was quite the motion picture. Russell Crowe did a wonderful job portraying John Nash that you would think he was actually John Nash. Though you have to ask yourself if this movie will ever have a ""happy"" or ""non- depressing moment"", the ending will certainly please you. And as odd as it may seem this movie actually had funny moments in it. A beautiful mind...a beautiful story."

","I will not spoil this film for anybody who does not know what its really about. I was completely surprised to find the true story about halfway into the film. The film did not market the real story behind the story in the previews or pre-release hype. I will say Russell Crowe does a fine job as lead Character and will surely be nominated for another academy award. The acting is solid all the way around and the film progresses at a perfect pace, it really does a great job of surprising you. I especially enjoyed the acting of Paul Bettany who portrays Crowe's roommate in the film. I give a Beautiful Mind 10/10 stars, excellent movie."

","Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of Ron Howard nor Akiva Goldsman and maybe this colored my subconcious going into A Beautiful Mind, however I will say that I went into this film wanting to like it; or to love it like so many others have. Unfortunately, I cannot say that this is the case.<br/><br/>As much as people would like to say that Ron Howard has matured as a director, he's still just competent at best. Much like John Nash deciphered simple newspaper headlines I saw through the mechanisms used to bring his story to the screen.<br/><br/>This film is such a hodge-podge of other movies, Fight Club meets Awakenings meets Rain Man come to mind that I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Don't laugh at my comparison, Ron directed The Grinch and Akiva wrote Batman and Robin; these guys are hacks. James Horner even jumps into the act by recycling his Titanic theme during a key scene in the film.  I rolled my eyes some more.   Horners done this before, but not this obvious. John Nash's winning the Nobel Prize for Economics is skirted over favoring tepid dialog and tear jerking.  Perhaps Nash's story wasn't cinematic enough to be told literally that it needed to exagerrate the scizophrenia and romance elements.  Further insulting is that the story is not factually correct.   Nash clinically did not have schizophrenia until 1959, many years after completing some of his most complicated mathematical  work.  It is clinically proven that a schizophrenic in incapable of such a task.  So much for realism.  I'll take David Lynch's take on the subject in Muholland Drive any day over this drivel.<br/><br/>The cast is good as it should be, however I feel Crowe is mis-cast as the lead. He was great as the paranoid everyman in The Insider and believable as a, well gladiator in Gladiator but in Beautiful Mind he seems a little out of place playing an eccentric mathematician. He plays the part well but I unfortunately didn't buy it.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad film but not deserving of all the acclaim it's receiving."

The double tear-jerker ending, which I loved, made this a movie to remember.

","While I was watching Ron Howard's `A Beautiful Mind' it seemed uninteresting, but I couldn't quite pinpoint why.  Looking back, the film has a fantastic story, appropriate soundtrack, and great cinematography. However, I soon realized that mediocre acting and a bland script compromised these elements which could have made an excellent movie. The storyline in `A Beautiful Mind' revolves around the life of mathematician John Nash, a genius who is eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.  The film is made to show us what schizophrenia is like; the audience is able to see the world the way John Nash sees it, complete with hallucinated people and occurrences.  Nash's struggle against his schizophrenia is intriguing, and his struggle reaches a happy conclusion when he is awarded the Nobel Prize. Throughout the film, brilliant cinematography gives the audience a unique perspective on Nash's world.  Camera techniques show not only the way Nash sees real and imagined patterns, but give us insight into Nash's relationship with his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) as well.  In one scene, after Nash is diagnosed with schizophrenia, we see the rift that has come between him and his wife through the way the camera is set up to show both Nash and his wife in the kitchen, but with a wall between them. Details like this add up throughout the film to contribute greatly to its effectiveness. Unfortunately, the cinematography could not obscure the blandness of Russell Crowe's acting.  It is difficult to empathize with Nash's character, which lacks depth, until the very end of the film.  However, by this time, Crowe is affecting an accent that sounds like Sean Connery's brogue, inspiring people to leave the theatre thinking `Well hello, Moneypenny,' even after the credits are finished."

It was so flat I couldn't believe there actually was a director- it seems someone simply aimed a camera at Russel Crowe and then left. Every scene is blandness epitomised- it's an interesting story, and Russel Crowe is a good actor, but Ron Howard has made such a hash of this it's incredible. I honestly think I could have done a better job. Not a single scene stood out- it all gelled into one mass of mediocrity. Ron Howard is carving a niche for himself as the most robotic director on the planet. No doubt the studio bigwigs love him.

Most of the math shown makes sense (for once) and is simply about mathematically representing groups of people by referencing to them using simple indexing numbers (i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 etc., and remember Venn diagrams with overlapping circles in high school), and also about reshaping space e.g. projecting the spherical earth onto a simple flat paper map.<br/><br/>I mostly liked the many small smart and beautiful little touches stories in the film.

","Although I was not very familiar with the history of John Nash, the man whose life this picture is based on, I did find the story compelling and the acting very good indeed. However if this was the best film of 2001 then it certainly was a mediocre year for movies. Yes the ending was moving but in a melodramatic movie-of-week sort of way. Jennifer Connelly gives a superb performance and she adds depth to her role as the stoic supportive wife. We can see her fear grow as the evidence mounts against her husband. Through her frustration the audience gets a sense of how hard it would be to stand by someone with that kind of illness. This makes the payoff at the end all the more sweet. But the fact that Nash's life story was cleaned up for the big screen does unfortunately detract from the movie. One can almost feel the focus groups and marketing surveys determining how the film will finally play out. This is a shame because of the remarkable and convincing way the audience is set-up to discover that Nash suffers from schizophrenia. If the film had gone on past the point where it ended I think it would have scored a bullseye. Because even without knowing that certain parts of Nash's life were left out, I still wondered if he really said the things he said when he gave his speech. The fact that the film ends where it does already seemed to make it just a little too much Hollywood. That parts of his life were left out to make the picture more ""commercial"" makes me wonder if other parts were over emphasized for dramatic effect. This takes a good film down a notch."

","A Beautiful Mind was a superb autobiography of Princeton Professor Jon Nash.  Russell Crowe gave an outstanding performance as the lead role, and Jennifer Connelly was good as the sainted wife who stood by.  Jon Nash was a genius who has had to battle schizophrenia since he was a student at Princeton.  Of all the times he hallucinates about his 'friend', Ed Harris's character, and the little girl you somehow want to believe it's real.  But it's not happening.  (i.e.  The car chase scene, and the fact he though he was a government agent.)  The movie itself can also be sad and frightning at times.<br/><br/>   Ron Howard sure has come a long way since Opie from The Andy Griffith Show.  Also another reason why he made this movie was because one of his family members is schizophrenic, too, like Jon Nash.  So, if you're tired of all those nonsensical ne'er-do-well teen/college student movies, or just want to see something that actually won an Oscar, then check out A Beautiful Mind.  May Russell Crowe's acting career take him to newer and better heights!  I give it 4 stars."

","This movie is one of the best I've seen. I didn't watch to watch it because it won the Oscar for Best Picture, and that isn't very good!! I hated Shakespeare in Love and American Beauty, and thought Gladiator was simply OK. Besides, Russell Crowe was, for me, a mediocre actor. But in this movie, he proves himself a great actor!! in fact, he makes this film a real pleasure to watch. His character is so well developed you can't help but love him. The other actors are also great. My favorite scene was when John receives the Nobel Prize and dedicates him for his wife. That scene DIDN´T REALLY HAPPEN. John Nash was divorced and remarried by that time. But I didn't know that when I saw the film, so I loved that scene. I'm glad they gave this movie a happy ending. I mean, it was charming. I wouldn't have enjoyed this film that much if the couple had divorced after everything Alicia had to go through. So in my opinion, changing the facts a little bit was a good decision.<br/><br/>I'm glad it won Best Picture. Lord of the Rings was great but not as good as this one. Moulin Rouge! sucked. The Academy´s decision was the best."

","This is a fantastic movie.  It left so many parts of Nash's life out, and parts of it were not historically accurate, but it was more than easy to fade that all out and just watch.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is not one of my favorite directors, but I appreciate him a lot more after this.  Ron Howard's schtick is being able to make any story nice. I mean, were he to do Angela's Ashes, the family would trip into a hole filled with money and live happily ever after.  He certainly proved his transforming abilities with this movie.<br/><br/>In reality, Nash was an arrogant, anti-Semitic, gay wife beater with annoying quirks.  (I do know that to be true.)  In the movie, he was hunky, genius, and his mannerisms were adorable.  He loved his wife, and they never got divorced and remarried, like Nash.<br/><br/>I always knew Russell Crowe was fantastic, and this just reinforced it.  (As a person, I think he's kind of annoying, but he is astonishingly talented.) He was the backbone of this movie, without Crowe, this movie would've fizzled and dried up.  He was great.  He amazed me throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie, if only to see Crowe's performance. Incredible.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","No-one would dare write a novel as far-fetched as John Nash jnr's life. A prodigy, a mathematical genius, a paranoid schizophrenic, a Nobel laureate. With raw material like this, ""A Beautiful Mind"" was always a short-priced favourite to be a good film. Well, it is, but I don't think the Academy was right to call it the best film of 2001.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deliver exceptional performances. I'm again frankly mystified why the Academy firstly nominated Connelly as a supporting actress when she gets enough screen time to be rightly regarded as a co-star. And as for Crowe not winning Best Actor, well... People who view this film superficially could write Crowe's performance off, dismissing it as thespian sleight-of-hand, a bit of hunching, stillness, some drool and hey, presto, paranoid schizophrenia. They would be wrong. There is so much depth to Crowe's portrayal. He plays Nash in the early years superbly as a self-acknowledged genius, arrogant but just a bit detached from normality, the accent just right. Then the years of Nash's illness, the terrifying delusions, the pain in his eyes during his insightful moments. This is incredible stuff, and Connelly is not overshadowed, she plays the role of Alicia masterfully.<br/><br/>It is interesting how Nash's delusional episodes are portrayed as real in this film, which is reasonable, given that they were real enough to Nash at the time. To tidy the film up, a couple of elements of Nash's life are neatly excised - the mistress, the early divorce from Alicia and their subsequent remarriage. Nash's 30 long years imprisoned in his illness are skimmed over in the final reel, which to my mind unbalanced the film a bit. It seems rushed in the last few minutes, as if Ron Howard has noticed that the film is already quite long and he's cramming the last bits in.<br/><br/>Finally, could it be that Ron Howard has constructed this film to draw parallels between Nash's life and that of post-war USA? Initial brilliance, unlimited potential and boundless optimism. Then a catastrophic fall into paranoid fantasy, stagnation, impotence and paralysis (for the USA, the Cold War years, culminating in Vietnam). Then a rebirth and recovery, slipping into comfortable autumn years with an acceptance of self, but at the same time an acknowledgment of the troubled past. As Harrison Ford said in ""Frantic"", ""I am an American and I am crazy!"""

","I have been a fan of Russell Crowe since L.A. Confidental. This movie is his tour de force.

"Nimrod1933","9","0","1","19 April 2002"," Magnificant
","*Warning may contain spoilers*<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind-4 1/2 Stars (out of 5)- The academy's best picture of the year can be defined in two words: Russell Crowe.  He never ceases to amaze me, which this is the bottom line. Throughout the entire movie Crowe portrays the incredibly intelligent and schizophrenic John Nash unbelievably.  I am amazed the entire time at how Crowe pulls this character off.  His body language, movements, conversations and facial expressions are put forth with flawlessness, the kind that someone of only Crowe's caliber can deliver.  Having seen such programs as the Sixty Minutes report on the actual John Nash, I can tell you that Crowe resembles what kind of person I saw in the short interview of this man. Its not so much how he makes you believe he is John Nash, its how Crowe makes us believe that he really is sick mentally and the audience truly is reeled in by the emotion and actions and we begin to see just how serious of a disease schizophrenia is. Ron Howard deservingly received the academy's award for best director (although in my opinion it could have gone to David Lynch) for A Beautiful Mind.  Howard does a brilliant job of truly showing us what John Nash's world was like.  The portrayal of what Nash is thinking is nothing short of extraordinary, as we see him break the ""hidden codes"" throughout the newspapers as he races to save America.  The movie is developed incredibly as the audience is sure what is on screen is reality and what is happening in John Nash's life is what is actually going on in real life.  The audience is then shocked to learn that a good portion of what was going on in the movie and a good amount of John Nash's actions and work was for nothing as it was all in his mind.  Using this method to expose Nash's mental sickness is a crucial part to the movie and is what really makes it stand out as an accomplishment for Howard as director and Akiva Goldsman for writing the adapted screenplay.  Howard's camera angles and methods of delving into Nash's mind are excellent and give us the necessary insight into Nash's physiological state. My hat goes off to the beautiful Jennifer Connelly as well for her role as Nash's love interest and wife Alicia Nash.  I did not think I could like a role of hers as much as her role in Requiem For A Dream but she came close to exceeding her performance here.  She did pick of the academy's award for best actress in a supporting role, which I would have given her as well. Simply put, she was magnificent.  Alicia serves as the medium for John between reality and his reality.  It is her that keeps him in check later on when he is battling the disease and it is ultimately Alicia that keeps Nash alive in reality and gives him the strength to continue.  The final major scene, Nash's speech at the Nobel Prize awards, is a speech in which he only thanks his wife and though it is not a long speech or well written one, it is a speech that delivers the emotion and the gratitude to Alicia Nash that is necessary for the audience to view.  Ms. Connelly, throughout the entire film, delivers the acting and emotion that is necessary to make us believe that John's situation is as horrible and agonizing as it seems. A Beautiful Mind is an incredible journey into the mind and life of Mr. John Nash.  The film is executed with perfection as everybody does the job needed.  Ron Howard does his best work ever as director, Russell Crowe arguably puts forth his best performance on the big screen and Jennifer Connelly helps us to understand the frustration and pain that was prominent for the real Alicia Nash as well as for any other relative, friend or loved one effected by this disease.  This film truly makes you sympathize with the Nash's and what they went through, but it also makes us appreciate our minds to a great extent.  The exposure of schizophrenia through this film will do good for work to help those with the disease and it will also give the public a better idea of how horrible and serious this disease really is. This movie produces on every level and is among the years best without a doubt."
"Rakesh Kumar","Null","0","1","18 April 2002"," Seeing through a wonderful mind.
","I expected a depressing movie. I was not disappointed, naturally. But the surprising part was the amount of humour in it. Mostly self-deprecating ones that made the audience chuckle, rather than laughing out aloud.<br/><br/> There had been complaints that this screen treatment of the biography of Nobel prize winning Professor John Nash (by Sylvia Nassar) did not entirely cover the more private side (or darker side) of his, which involved homosexual experiment. I did not miss it. To be frank, it was not necessary. We were not told to sympathise with Nash, who is already struggling with paranoid schizophrenia, but rather witness the world through his mind. Homosexuality need not apply. As Russell Crowe, who plays Nash, put it aptly in one of the award ceremony; `It's only a movie, folks.'<br/><br/> Fans of fast paced action movies back off. It's not for you. If you like a film, heavy on drama, liberal on humour, and generous on performance, this is good stuff. Crowe gets to play another real person after The Insider and he does what is expected of him. Jennifer Connelly is fine, but there are moments where you wonder if she was doing it for the awards. That's all right, if it was in the script.<br/><br/> Ron Howard won a long deserved Academy Award for this film. Finally a recognition after years of neglect. I still feel that he should have got one for either Backdraft or Apollo 13. He deserves one for this.<br/><br/> Oh yes, I forgot about Ed Harris. Here's another example of an actor who can sleep walk any role and still make it important. When will this guy get recognised at the Oscars.  Catch him in this movie as another government-related official, and he still looks he is doing it for the first time.  Harris is definitely a rare talent who can polish up stereotypes and make it look interesting. Bravo Harris! I look forward to seeing more of you...in the award ceremonies of course."

","Well I must stress that most of the time I disagree with the Academy's picks for best picture. The Academy has always chosen the wrong movies such as Titanic, The gladiator, American Beauty and finally A beautiful Mind. I thought ""A Beautiful Mind"" would be a bad movie, since it was chosen by the Academy, but it certainly wasn't that bad. The academy doesn't see what's really worthy. `The others' was an outstanding movie; it should have received what it did. There are so many wonderful movies that weren't even nominated for best picture. But anyway it doesn't matter. ""A Beautiful Mind"" isn't that good; nevertheless I really liked it a little. I'm so glad the academy chose it instead of ""Lord of the Rings"". I don't deny it was much better than the over-rated movie I already mentioned. The acting was believable, but I didn't see anything great about Jennifer Connelly's performance. I don't like Russell Crowe at all, He seems to be such an arrogant and pretentious person, but I must say that he acted very well in this movie. I like this movie because it teaches us to love all the things we have and to ignore all the people who make us feel bad. It's a well-told and acted story. The make up of this movie was amazing. The way John Nash got older was utterly believable. <br/><br/>Overall I'm glad it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, this is a movie in which we all can learn many things about life, we all have to live everyday to its fullest. 7/10"
"filmbuff-31","Null","0","1","18 April 2002"," Beautiful mind. . . mad scientist?
","This movie presents an interesting variation on the mad scientist theme. It is the true story of Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash. Having been an academic for most of my life, I could readily identify<br/><br/>with Mr. Nash's ongoing struggle for respect and even sanity inside the ivory tower.  In such a tightly controlled, artificially constructed<br/><br/>world, Professor Nash seems to fit most of the stereotypes regarding<br/><br/>academics.  A preoccupation--to the point of obsession--with his work,<br/><br/>for one.  A lack of social and communication skills that most other<br/><br/>people in the world take for granted is another of these stereotypes.<br/><br/>The movie gets you so inside the mind of John Nash that at one point about midway through the picture you, the viewer, cannot tell what is<br/><br/>real and what is delusional, even after the credible suggestion of<br/><br/>mental illness has been made.  <br/><br/>I don't want to diminish or misrepresent the traumatic nature of Prof. Nash's experiences, but I was struck, from a personal point of view, by the nature of his phantoms.  Nearly everybody has been haunted by a<br/><br/>personal phantom or two.  Maybe someone wanted to become a teacher and<br/><br/>never did.  Maybe such a person came close to marrying someone and never did.  We all are haunted by phantoms similar to those Professor Nash<br/><br/>experienced whenever we believe in something with our whole heart and<br/><br/>mind and are disappointed.  We continue to judge ourselves and those<br/><br/>close to us by the standards of our disappointed hopes.  Mr. Nash lived in an environment which exaggerated these tendencies to the point<br/><br/>requiring medical treatment.  But pondering the true nature of his<br/><br/>phantoms--perhaps ""demons"" would be a better word--it seems to me that<br/><br/>his experiences are not completely alien to those of people who consider themselves free of delusions and quite sane.  The movie itself appears<br/><br/>to echo this point.  <br/><br/>In the end, it is Nash's wife, played by Jennifer Connelly, who is the<br/><br/>bridge between the world of delusion which Nash's mind experiences and the real world which exists independent of that experience.  She is the mediator of his sanity and ours (as an audience)."
"mweston","8","0","2","18 April 2002"," 3.5 stars
","I saw this on 2/19/2002. The title refers to the mind of John Nash, a brilliant but eccentric mathematician played by Russell Crowe. This film, which is based on the real life of John Nash, opens in 1947 when he arrives at Princeton, and continues through a period of 47 years. During this time his eccentricity is seen to deepen into mental illness, and we see his struggles against it in a way few others could attempt.<br/><br/>Crowe's performance here is quite remarkable, both in terms of portraying the changing phases of his life, but also his ability to show us what he is feeling in his early encounters with his schoolmates and his future wife (played very well by Jennifer Connelly) and his later battles with mental illness. Ed Harris, on the other hand, is under used. The direction, by Ron Howard, is quite good in its ability to show us the inner workings of Nash's mind, both in its mathematical brilliance and in its struggles with sanity.<br/><br/>The biggest aspect that holds this film back from greatness is its simplification and Hollywood-izing of Nash's life. For example, Nash's bisexuality is left out of the film. But even if the package is just a little too neatly wrapped, this is a film that is highly recommended."
"Dble07jamesbond","10","0","1","16 April 2002"," Best movie seen at the theater in a long time
","A Beautiful mind was by far the best film I have seen in the theater for a little bit of time now. Before that I would say that the Sixth Sense was the best--although there were excellent movies that did come out after. (I had just seen those at home). Nevertheless, ""A Beautiful Mind"" should not be ignored and should be viewed by those who feel out of place with themselves and try their hardest to show their potential..but never seem to be able to get it across to someone. As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in ""Mind"". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparible to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's ""The Boston Strangler"". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstical that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed. Along with Crowe's magnificent performance, we were given a marvelous music score by James Horner. (I think that had Randy Newman not won simply for breaking his losing streak, Mr. Horner would have scooped up the award). The music added a beautiful tone to the movie and showed what Nash's mind must feel like within--eerie, confused, and beautiful. On a last note, As wonderful as Jennifer Connelly was in her role, I really think that her Oscar was uneccessary. She turned in a decent performance, but was certainly not Oscar caliber compared to the great Dame Maggie Smith's comic performance, and the ever charming Marissa Tomei's performance. But nevertheless, her Oscar just added to the movies list. :) If you intend on seeing a compelling movie with one of the best male actor's performance's in a long time, pull up a seat and watch ""A Beautiful Mind"". [Congrats to Ron Howard] :)"

"Shiva-11","8","0","2","3 January 2002"," A Beautiful Mind is a terrible thing to waste
","A Beautiful Mind<br/><br/>Few people ever cross paths with true genius.  My encounter happened while I lived in a university dormitory.  `Tom' was a gangly 17-year-old whose most distinguishing features were his penchant for missing classes, a photographic memory, and a flawless mastery of several different musical instruments.  I remember vividly the day he asked me to read a History paper that dealt with Sino/Indian relations in the Cold War era.  Written as Swiftian satire, it had taken him three hours to write and was one of the most insightful and brilliant things I've ever read. Although it was three months late, his professor said it was outstanding and gave Tom a first class grade.  However, as the axiom states, there is a fine line between genius and insanity   I soon learned that Tom was prone to fits of manic self-destruction and substance abuse.  The last I heard he was doing freelance work for Rolling Stone, had been published in several well-known literary magazines, was dabbling in heroin and was in heavy therapy. <br/><br/>
While studying at Princeton, John Nash sets himself a simple task - find an original idea that will revolutionize mathematics.  While such an undertaking reeks of hubris, it is a natural progression for John, a genius who dwells in a different world where everything, regardless of its apparent randomness is linked by theorems and patterns.  He is eventually recruited to work for the Department of Defense, where he becomes enmeshed in a shadowy netherworld of spies and conspiracies and loses touch with those around him. <br/><br/>Warning:  Potential spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>The fact that John Nash's findings shook the foundations of economic theory and earned him a Nobel Prize should be enough to impress anyone.  What makes his story truly remarkable is that he achieved what he did while struggling with paranoid schizophrenia.  The film's success ultimately rests on the lead's ability to capture Nash's tortuous journey.  Whoever cast Crowe deserves a hefty bonus.<br/><br/>Several days before I went to the sneak preview for  this film, reviewers were already gushing over Crowe's performance, and naming him as the frontrunner in the Oscar race.  Never one to swallow the word of critics (I know, ironic), I reserved judgment and can now state that Crowe is, for lack of a better word, riveting. The harder Nash struggles to crack the cosmological code, the weaker his grip on reality becomes and Crowe captures this masterfully.  He skillfully balances Nash's quirky brilliance and pathos as he dances between reality and insanity.  Crowe pulls the viewer into this crumbling world, and avoids becoming the stereotypical slobbering `madman'.  <br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is lyrically beautiful as John's wife Alicia (does she ever age?).  While the beginnings of their relationship seem dubious, does love ever really make sense? Connelly leaves the viewer with no doubt that Alicia was Nash's only link to the real world, tacit as it was  without her, he would probably still be languishing in a medicated stupor in some asylum.  Connelly gives Alicia a soul, wringing everything she can from her lines and I feel that it was a disservice to both Connelly and her character that she was not given more substantive dialogue.  Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also turn in excellent performances.  <br/><br/>While the acting and direction in the film is exceptional, more attention should have been paid to the editing and pacing  several sections lag unnecessarily, notably the extended scenes that dwell on Nash's madness. They could have been cut down without lessening the impact.  In addition, Crowe's accent, which is hard to peg, slips a few times (okay, I'm being picky, but I really notice that).  The biggest `problem' is the marketing: the trailers are deceiving, leading you to believe that the film is a cloak and dagger thriller when it is so much more. <br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is one of those rare films that will appeal to both casual moviegoers and cinema fans alike."
"knipshun","10","0","1","16 April 2002"," Succeeds on all Levels
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's hard to start at a certain point in praising this film.  It has been a few months since the movie's release but I just got around to seeing it. Needless to say, I'm glad the illness which Crowe possessed was not revealed to me (unlike the Sixth Sense was), greatly surprising me!  Russell Crowem the Aussie.  While not a big fan of him as a person (cocky and a bit rude), I cannot deny his acting skills.  He may possibly be the best actor at the present time, joining the ranks of Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, and Denzel Washington. <br/><br/>Crowe's portrayal of the sick Nash takes on many levels of character development, essential in creating a good film.  The supporting cast around him merely made his performance look that much better, such as Joaquin Phoenix (no Oscar) did in Gladiator.  An array of emotions poured out by the transformed Crowe made me feel that Crowe had forgotten himself and had become Nash (much like Tom Cruise does with his characters).  This is what acting is truly about.  Anyone can see an actor (faker) and an ACTOR (if anyone gets what I am saying cause this messageboard wont let me use any damn italics).   <br/><br/>I am aware that the story was Hollywoodized to make it the ""feel good movie of the year"" (geez...there seem to be so many of those), but I felt it was necessary to do such.  With a depressing story such as this one, a boost was definitely needed.  But not all the time, don't get me wrong.  Sometimes people just gotta die in Lifetime movies OK?  But back to the point.  The film won best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress, all which I felt were deserved.  I still question why Crowe's name was not amongst the winners.  I am not downsizing Washington's role in Traing Day whatsoever but if the entire rest of the crew succeeds in supporting the main star, shouldnt the main star win as well?  <br/><br/>One lase point.  The film succeeds in letting you see what life is really about, love.  Crowe's character comes to the realization that love is not a mathematical problem that can be solved.  It is merely a feeling that cannot be explained.  In one of the most cliche but none-the-less tear-jerking lines at the end of the film, Crowe makes this point stick.  He calls his wife his ""reason"".  Sappy but Im a sucker.  <br/><br/>I have seen only a few films which rank at the level which I am about to give.  Notice this is a film, not a movie (a film sounds more prestigious). From the guy who doesn't fall for MI2 being cool, I give it my highest rating of a 10.  10/10<br/><br/>Everyone has an opinion, and I am merely stating mine."
"yaseminturkish","9","0","1","16 April 2002"," Follows the tradition of the mental illness genre but Russell Crowe elevates the film to a new level
","An ordinary mental illness genre film would have dissolved into the typical paint by numbers rule in which the lead actor adequately performs his role and his problems are understood only by the audience.  A Beautiful Mind follows the rule that only the audience and his wife can sympathize with the mental patient but it develops into something more because of the difficulty and depth of Russell Crowe's performance.  Do you remember the small but poignant scene where John Nash attempted to hold his newborn son in the rocking chair?  It was a simple scene that wouldn't be difficult for an actor but the facial expressions and look of pain in Crowe's eyes elevated it to a new level.  Say what you want about Crowe and his real-life shenanigans but be open to the idea that liking him as an actor should be more about how he performs in his roles and less about condemnation of his bad-boy persona.<br/><br/>  It is a shame that Crowe performed better this year than the always dependable and Oscar-deserving Denzel Washington (He should have won for Malcolm X in 1992) and became virtually the only nominee from A Beautiful Mind who lost the chance to grace the podium.  After all, Jennifer Connelly simply played the conventional role of the young wife who understands but has difficulty dealing with her husband's condition.  Connelly fared better in the little-seen but unforgettable film Requiem for a Dream.  Ron Howard's directorial award was somewhat overblown when you realize that Robert Altman had to skillfully handle 20+ speaking parts in Gosford Park and he did it wonderfully without breaking a sweat.  And perhaps it's just me but can anyone else not forget that Ron Howard once direct Elijah Wood in that pathetic movie North?  <br/><br/>  A Beautiful Mind is the kind of film that you'll remember 20 years down the road but less for the conventional plot and more for what Russell Crowe brought to the role.  The comparison to Rain Man is justified here because that was a movie where your likely to forget the road trip shared by Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) and his brother Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and more likely to remember how Dustin Hoffman had to have maple syrup with his pancakes and only wore K-Mart underwear.  Rain Man also lacked a viable plot but movies within the mental patient genre are not meant to focus on plots but on patients.  In that sense the so-called boring storyline of A Beautiful Mind is forgivable because much more beautiful than the Nash speech at the end is the way that Russell Crowe's eyes express the feelings that his mouth cannot speak.<br/><br/>9/10 (The best performance by an actor since Denzel Washington in Malcolm X)"

This movie did everything for me, and there was no action. It made me laugh, it was intense at moments, I cried like I haven't in years and in the end all I thought about was driving to Princeton and taking the chance that I could actually get to see or even meet Mr. Nash himself.

","I totally agree to others whose comments you can find below: ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a good movie, but really nothing special; it's moving, well-acted, sometimes funny and you actually do care for the main character but it's neither a milestone in film history (or at least a truly great film) nor the best picture of the year, dear AMPAS; these attributes totally apply to ""The Fellowship Of The Ring""! It has to be pretty obvious for anybody who had the chance to compare both pictures that the latter one, this meaningful fantasy roller coaster-ride of our lives has been robbed at the Oscars'! And I'm just a movie-lover... Anyway, it has to be mentioned that both Connelly (pretty well done on uncommon ground) and Crowe (much better than in ""Gladiator"") give convincing performances although the script does not serve them well (especially Connelly has to play a one-and-a-half-dimensioned character, the other supporting characters simply aren't supposed to be more than one-dimensional). That's the main problem: Akiva Goldsman? Oscar winner? In such a strong competition - ""Memento"", ""LOTR""??? Unbearable. Scandalous and a slap for those who transferred Tolkien's huge novel into an overwhelmingly satisfying movie experience. The script has a twist you will recognize after the first half, but, oh boy, that's nothing we've never seen before, and the second half simply is waaay too long and pathetic (the pen scene... you could see it coming!). For about half an hour you wait for story development and when you get it, the movie's almost over. Come on! Since I direct myself, I fully appreciate Ron Howard's good work, making something watchable out of a dull script but again - Oscar for that??? Even Ridley Scott would have deserved it more for his cinematic hurricane. And the best indeed was Peter Jackson! How about this: nobody remembers the winner films of 1941 and 1968 more than the Oscar losers in these years, ""Citizen Kane"" and ""2001"", and in a few decades, you'll talk about the ""LOTR""-trilogy as of some of the greatest movies ever made, wondering if you still know what ""A Beautiful Mind"", this little, not extraordinary film was all about."

","This is an outstanding motion picture telling the powerful story of the rise & fall, then subsequent triumphant rise again of Dr. John Nash. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the compelling lead.

Jennifer Connelly delivers a memorable performance as well giving brave portrayal of Nash's wife, which earned her a well-deserved Oscar in the female lead category. Yet the major credit for this well-crafted motion picture is the inventive collaboration of director Ron Howard's vision with the skilled production talents of Brian Grazer who took home Oscar that same year for Best Director and Best Picture respectively. Through their collective efforts they utilized Akiva Goldsman's Oscar winning screenplay in a clever and imaginative way to transform this sympathetic yet complex story into a delightful, pleasing to the eye treat that will engage all that screen this powerful biography of a brilliant yet flawed professor."

","Spoiler Alert This film is a full loss of talent. Apart from Russell Crowe's good performance, the rest is pure Hollywood entertainment, sold as deep and pretentious study about madness and pain. Why doesn't Hollywood intend to risk anymore? Does someone remind that in 70's Hollywood mainstream meant ""Network"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""The Way We Were"", ""One Flew On the Cuckoo's Nest"" etc., films where spectacular and ""popular"" tastes mixed beautifully with social themes and deep, sincere, honest feelings? ""A Beautiful Mind"" is neither honest nor sincere: it's empty, heartless, ""overflowed"", and above all it is unbelievable, devoid of the least ""vraisemblance"". In USA cinema representation of geniality has always some problems: ""Good Will Hunting"" had the same ridicolous faults of ""A Beautiful Mind"" (numbers that flow in the main character's eyes, moments of epiphany, geniality pushed in a some-fantasy atmosphere that is so contrastive in comparison with the realistic intentions of both of the films). Moreover, John Nash's hallucinations are ridiculous as well: they have a surplus of ""adventurous"" stories that are too far from reality. Fortunately Jennifer Connelly saves the love story, but her performance is not so extraordinary as the Academy thought (Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were too much better than she). And, given that in John Nash's illness had such a deep influence the international political atmosphere of those years (the Cold War, the terror beholded by the American Government against the USSR etc.) and John Nash looks like a victim of social psychological terrorism nourrished in the American people by the Government, why didn't Ron Howard deepen the relationships between social environment and mental halienation (the scene where John Nash, captured by the doctors, cries ""They're Russian! They're Russian! Help me! Help me!"" is so awkward and superficial!!! A scene demanding for vengeance!!!)? So, what remains of this false triumph of cinema? Just a good Russell Crowe, and a false fiction about a real pain. Have a look to Nanni Moretti's ""The Son's Room"", rather, and you'll live a painful fictitious experience of a real pain. Cinema doesn't need cries, screams and deliria trementes to represent pain. The silences and the little movements of ""The Son's Room"" are quite enough to paint the schizophrenic life of people facing an unbearable, ""unthinkable"" pain."

His portrayal of John Nash is so completely different from his role in Gladiator that you could swear it wasn't even the same person. Aside from the spotty accent, he became John Nash. In my mind, he should definitely win another Academy Award. If you don't particularly like Russell Crowe, see this movie anyway, if only for the performances of the many other great actors that appear. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Paul Bettany, who was one of the saving graces of A Knight's Tale. His performance was particularly convincing and realistic. I was expecting a good movie and it was better than good.

I  knew  almost  nothing  about  the  movie  before. I  thought  it  was  a typical  Hollywood  movie  and  I  don't  like  this  kind. But  as  the film  went  on  I  was  left  speechless. Russell  Crowe's  playing  was shattering. He  really  stole  the  performance ; in  the  movie  you  see nobody  else  but  him. I  have  seen people  suffering  from  mental illness  on  the  screen  before ( Shine, Ð etc ), but  it  is  the  first time  an  actor  gets  so  much  in  the  flesh  of  the  role, without resorting  to  hyperbolic and  easy  tricks. It  is  also  Ron  Howard that deserves  congratulations. The  atmosphere  of  the  film  is  unique, something  that  must  also  be  attributed  to  James  Horner's evocative music. I  don't  think  I'm  able  to  talk  more  about  the  movie  and Russell  Crowe's  playing ; I  just  say  that  watching  ''A  Beautiful Mind''  was  one  of  the  greatest  experiences  of  my life. I  have  watched  all  this  discussion  going  on, about  many  incidents in  John  Nash's  life  being  omitted  in  the  movie  and  about  others being  changed. I  don't  think  that  the  presentation  of  all  actual facts  in  Nash  life  ( homosexual  relationships, illegitimate  child etc ) would  make  any  difference. The  central  point  of  the  story  was  a man  with  remarkable  mental  abilities, who  struggled  to  distinguish himself, to  prove  he  was  extraordinary; and  that  due  to schizophrenia  this  extraordinary  man  was  almost  vanished, but  he fought  his  illness  and  finally  showed  his  worth. That  is  what  I saw  in  this  story  and  what  moved  me  so  much. As  far  as  the  theme  of  schizophrenia  is  concerned, I  think  that the  film  doesn't  say  exactly  that  John  Nash  quit  taking  his medication. Of  course, he  continued  having  hallucinations, but  this continued  until  the  end  of  the  film, when  he  said  he  was  taking a  new  medication.I  know  the  message  of  the  movie  is  that  John Nash  fought  schizophrenia  with  the  power  of  his  will ; but  I  also think  the  film, in  a  clever  way, leaves  the  story  a  bit ambiguous. ''A  Beautiful  Mind''  really  changed  my  life ; everyone  should  see it, so  that  they'll  see  their  life  change  too! E.Komi, Greece"

","A Beautiful Mind is to all extents an excellent piece of cinema.<br/><br/>However it is not the sort of film that deserves 4 Academy Awards, in particular for Achievement in Direction and Best Film.<br/><br/>It is my view that the one nomination that the film truly deserved to win for was Best Actor, although Denzel Washington was excellent in Training Day, it was not a role worthy of the award. He has been in the past far more deserving. However that is besides the point I am glad he eventually won. However I believe the events surrounding Russell Crowe is the main reason that he failed to take the award for a second year on the trot, he ladies and gentleman is once again the jewel of the film!<br/><br/>Ron Howard directed admirably, but that again as many who have seen A Beautiful Mind will agree it is a film that could have been directed by a great number of people and is by no means the supremely challenging directing task that Lord of the Rings posed.<br/><br/>By comparison Lord of the Rings is a movie of exquisite quality and the combined efforts of so many, led obviously very ably from the front, by Peter Jackson is far more deserving of an award titled 'Best achievement in Direction'. Frankly LOTR was the most intelligently directed film I have ever, repeat ever seen, and to see it lose its directing Oscar to a film, which though well done was not overtly challenging is in my mind daylight robbery.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind's OST written by John Horner is both beautiful, no pun intended, and fairly original. It has all the hallmarks of Horner, but it fits aptly with the emotional wranglings of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would suggest that although an excellent film, it is one which is over-rated in the extreme. See it, rent it I assure you that you will like it, but I feel its success with Awards is unfair at best. The Academy has got to review the titles for their awards, because I am sorry but if they think that the adaption of Sylvia Nasar's book by Akiva Goldsman is an achievement in even the same realm as the adaptation of the undisputed first-instalment of the greatest work of fantasy ever and one of the biggest selling works of fiction of the last century, then they are simply misguided.<br/><br/>I rest my case!<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is great, I assure it will move you, but will you walk away chanting, ""best film of the year"".....?<br/><br/>I think you Will agree No!"

The films glossy style never for a second makes you feel like you're watching something that's completely true to the real story it is based on, or that the filmmakers even tried. The real problem is screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (Batman & Robin, Lost in Space...!), who obviously filled his screenplay with any cliche he could think of. There's, sadly, not an ounce of originality here.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the performances are nothing short of brilliant, especially Russell Crowe who proves to be one of the most versatile actors around, which makes you wish the film would have been in the hands of more daring filmmakers. Instead, what you get is your typical, run-of-the-mill Hollywood biopic, which is watchable for the acting, but disappoints because of a director who chose to play it all too safe, and said script (they were aiming for theÃ­r Oscars, and they got em).

This movie is based on a book by Slyvia Nasar which is a true story about Dr John Nash a celebrated mathematic genius whose theories have revolutionized Economics. Dr Nash still lives in Princeton , New Jersey.

Well that's Prof Nash for you !!! , the story spans from 1947 to 1994 , starting from his life at the university wherein he submits a paper on a revolutionary theory , to his life thereafter, wherein he falls in love with his student, is diagnosed for Schizophrenia and how he fights this neuro disorder and comes out trumps.

The subtle glances, shifting vision, nervousness , that restrained voice a funny almost scary smile really makes you respect this young actor.

","'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those inspirational films about a troubled man struggling against the odds and winning. The kind that do well at the Oscars, like 'Gandhi' or 'Forrest Gump'. Russell Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathematician who developes schizophrenia and loses touch with reality. He deals with his illness with the help of his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Fashionable cynicism aside, it is a wonderful story, because it's true. Of course some of the nastier things Nash did when he was nuts - like slag Jews - are ignored for the sake of a tighter script and a more appealing hero. This is an example of why the movie is good but not great - director Ron Howard ('Apollo 13', Richie in 'Happy Days') can't quite trust the story. He has to overplay his hand, showing Alicia's nobility and Nash's courage a little heavy-handedly, letting the music soar a bit too much, in short making a Hollywood movie. It's not that 'A Beautiful Mind' is sickening or earnest - there's a surprising amount of laugh-out-loud moments relating to Nash's delusions and some gripping scenes - but there is enough schlock to keep it from being really outstanding. <br/><br/> The performance that sums up how overrated the movie is belongs to Jennifer Connelly. She was widely praised by critics and picked up Best Supporting Actress at the Baftas and Oscars, but frankly she's too beautiful for her role. There are no lines of care on her face, not enough weariness or pain. It's pretty hard to see why she falls for a self-centered, socially inept nerd like Nash. Connelly tries hard, but gives us an angel when we need a real woman. <br/><br/> It is Crowe on whom the movie stands. As a man he may be little more than another Aussie yobbo, but on screen he's a class act. Look around a campus, particularly the Science blocks, and you'll see his young Nash: twitchy, not quite meeting the eye, a little hunched, very smart, the social skills of a hermit crab. Later, in Nash's prime, he becomes more aloof, arrogant, contemptuous of 'lesser mortals'. then the schizophrenia sets in, the nervousness returns and his eyes become sunken and desperate. I can't imagine a more different role than Maximus in 'Gladiator', which shows that Crowe has one hell of a range as an actor. Some may find his performance mannered, but as he spends most of the movie portraying a man on the edge of sanity it works, and works terrifically well. <br/><br/> In the end we are left with a fine film: 'A Beautiful Mind' is well directed with a good script, a solid supporting cast and a great lead actor. But best film? Give me the grandeur of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', the cleverness of 'Memento' or the charm of 'Amelie' any day.<br/><br/>  7 1/2 /10"

","So soft and touching is A Beautiful mind. It has it sad and scary moments but also has its funny laughing moments. Seeing a world were all you thought was real, was only a dream. Or in John Nash's case, a illusion. Seeing what is really not there and cannot tell between the real and fake, can be a frightening experience. Living in a world were all your work is a lie, can scare you. Living in a world were no one beleives you, can scare you. A Beautiful Mind was indeed Beautiful, it showed a man's love and desire to lead a life with his wife and to do what he is great at. Seeing numbers in everything, is amazing. But ignorning things that taunt you, is miraculos. It is hard and makes me understand, what the disease really is. A genius, cursed with a heavy load. Seeing a FBI agent and solving hard riddles that do not exist is indeed the brink of life. Showing a woman's compassion to help her husband thru this time, is Beautiful.

It is the story of the brilliant and tortured John Nash, mathematician and Nobel laureate, a man who wrestled with the demons of mental illness and came out on top.<br/><br/>Or is it?<br/><br/>If you read the book on which the movie was based - and be forewarned, it is NOT an easy read - you will find that the movie really had only the most tenuous connection with John Nash's life. He was brilliant. He was arrogant. He was mad. He married Alicia. And he won a Nobel prize.<br/><br/>
Yet even after I read the book, and saw Nash himself interviewed (and heard him make discouraging comments that his schizophrenic son should employ more ""rational thinking""), I found that I still like the movie.<br/><br/>
Maybe because I have wrestled with my own demons of mental illness (though mine are tame compared to Nash's), I found myself in sympathy with Nash's film self. I also felt for Alicia, as my spouse has had to go through some harrowing moments with me. Scenes in the hospital were a bit unnerving. Yet there a poignant hope surrounding the film, that those of us in the depths may find the light in the tunnel, and passage out of the darkness.<br/><br/>Akiva Goldsman's script was both luminous and shadowy, probing the mind of genius and insanity with equal aplomb. Someone so complex as Nash could not have been brought to life by a poor writer. Sylvia Nasar's book is excellent; Goldsman's screenplay, though bearing only slight resemblance to the book, is excellent as well. The movie owes much to the screenplay's brilliance.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe did a wonderful job as Nash, portraying the man on many levels. The one problem for me was his accent, or lack thereof. Only twice did he lapse into something faintly resembling a Southern accent. The rest of the time I kept hearing Richard Burton, particularly as George in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Crowe will be the perfect choice to play Burton's role in the remake.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly was both strong and delicate as Alicia Nash. (It would have been nice if the film had at least hinted that Alicia is Hispanic.) Ed Harris rarely stumbles, and he was certainly in fine form as the hard-as-nails - and ultimately terrifying - William Parcher.  Judd Hirsch was unfortunately wasted in a throw-away part. <br/><br/>Ulimately, however, it was the performance of Paul Bettany that made me go back to the theater a second time, and what will make me buy the video as soon as it is released. As the ""prodigal roommate"" Charles Herman, Bettany was a perfect foil and comic relief for Crowe's anguished Nash. The role of Charles may well have been the most difficult in the film, and Bettany did it proud. I was disappointed that the Academy Awards overlooked him.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the film owes its heart and soul to its director, Ron Howard. I've never been a huge fan of Howard's pictures - though I did like ""Apollo 13"" (and ""Gung Ho"" had its moments: ""No more MTV! No more Twisted Sister!""). With ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Ron grows up. It's nice to see one of my contemporaries make good after many years of hard work. (You can always count on Ron to include his family in his pictures - Daddy Rance showed up in ""A Beautiful Mind"" as a mental patient, and Ron himself was a party guest.)<br/><br/>While much of the pre-Oscar buzz going around was true - ""A Beautiful Mind"" does sugarcoat Nash's rather abrasive personality - the best thing to do is judge the film as a separate entity. Read the book for the life of John Nash. Watch ""A Beautiful Mind"" to see a beautiful movie."

","This is one of the rare films that i felt deeply moved by. Whilst i watched it i felt such sympathy for Professor John Nash, and after watching it i realised that there are people in the world that are mentally ill and that the world for them must be so different from the way i see it.<br/><br/>If you've not seen it this film it's about the life of John Nash, the film shows his life from 1942 right up to 1994. Through his life he faces many difficulties. He is mentally-ill and sees things that we don't. This condition puts many people in risk and at one point in it life it totally controlled him. I really recommend this film to everyone."

","As a movie, A Beautiful Mind works well enough - in fact, it comes off as a standard Hollywood ""man meets adversity and conquers it with the support of a loyal woman"" film.<br/><br/>Watching it though, I couldn't help feeling that a complex life had been simplified and ironed out to fit that standard mold.  What do we know of the real man behind the film, at the end?  Do we get any sense of the complexity of his achievements, or of his problems?  If I were to believe this movie, I would believe that Nash had only one single idea in his life, and a simple (if pervasive) problem to face.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, at the end, I'm left with the images of Crowe acting out nervous tics, and Jennifer Connelly playing the impossibly loyal wife.<br/><br/>The IMDB info for this film says that ""A number of facts in John Nash's life were intentionally altered for dramatic and commercial reasons"" - unfortunately, so many of them that in the end A Beautiful Mind felt like a lie to me.  Ron Howard got his dramatic and commercial success, but something significant was lost in the translation..."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","2","2 April 2002"," Beautiful. A startlingly convincing portrayal of mental illness.
","A Beautiful Mind is a difficult movie to review. I always think that the terrible movies are the most fun to review, because there's nothing better than slashing a movie like Scary Movie or Coyote Ugly that is obviously a belligerent mess, but it is the great films that allow for the presentation of some meaning in a review, and A Beautiful Mind presents a unique set of challenges in reviewing a great film. One way to begin to look at this film is to simply try to list the vast number of ways in which the film illuminates different elements of the human condition. There are the obvious ones, such as the problems associated with mental illness, as well as the fact that people who suffer from mental illness can be considered nothing other than victims, but are still all too often frightened and hurt by their treatment, but then there are less obvious ones, such as the fact that people truly are a product of their environment, and in the case of John Nash, that very environment lashes out at him when it is not processed correctly in his head. <br/><br/>Whatever the extent to which these things are true, Nash's delusions are clearly a result of the stress involved in his education (as well as the fact that, as they say, genius is often associated with madness), the stress involved with the type of work that his specialty leads to, and perhaps most importantly, Nash's perception of the government as cryptic and potentially dangerous, as well as his perception of the Russians as dangerous people who are constantly involved in some sort of conspiracy. Nash becomes a victim of that a government in his own mind as well as in the real world, although in the real world they are seeking to help him rather than to force him to perform work that he doesn't believe in. <br/><br/>(spoilers) The first 45 minutes to an hour of A Beautiful Mind, admittedly, are hardly Oscar material, either the acting or directing or anything else, but once you realize that Nash's entire occupation with the government as well as his roommate were all in his head, then you go back and analyze the beginning of the film more closely with that knowledge. This is very much the same kind of plot twist that we saw in The Sixth Sense a couple years ago, except that it is much more applicable to real life in this case. The Sixth Sense was the portrayal of a sort of afterlife, the existence of which is very much debatable, while A Beautiful Mind is the portrayal of a man with schizophrenia, which is a very real and very incurable disease. The film is, in fact, virtually a textbook of schizophrenic symptoms and the workings of schizophrenia.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about In Dreams, a film that I truly enjoyed and I will stand by my assertion that it is a quality film, was the way that it presented the mental illness of Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.), the rather unusual villain presented in that film. In fact, I think I said something in my review of In Dreams about how you should watch the movie if you want to know what it's like to be insane, but A Beautiful Mind is a much more mature, realistic, and convincing presentation of a more specific and more debilitating mental disease than whatever it was exactly that Vivian suffered from in In Dreams. This is not a psychological thriller, but an intensely humanitarian drama that powerfully delivers the extraordinary story of John Nash's life. <br/><br/>There is just the right amount of humor in just the right places, Ron Howard's brilliant direction takes us through the unimaginable maze of schizophrenia, and you leave the film feeling that you have not only been entertained for two and a half hours, but that you have learned something important about one of the most devastating mental illnesses currently acknowledged and studied. There are thousands of things that you simply can't learn from reading a book, and the true nature of mental illnesses is obviously one of them. While I can't say whether or not A Beautiful Mind accurately depicted schizophrenia (because I don't suffer from it, nor does anyone I know), I can say that it is an exceptional portrayal of the thing that victims of schizophrenia experience. Through his vast contributions to humanity despite being plagued by terrifying schizophrenic delusions, John Nash has entered the realm of mentally ill people who have truly done great things in spite of their illnesses, such as Kay Redfield Jamison and Sylvia Plath, both of whom have written startlingly enlightening books that illuminate their respective disorders. I've always thought that it would just be great to be as recognized and respected as Nash has become, with the condition that I would not have to suffer through all of the hardships that he went through. John Nash has more than earned his fame, both because of his illness and because of his accomplishments (although potentially not because of either of them alone), and A Beautiful Mind is a fantastic film that brings it all to the screen for the public to see and to learn and benefit from."

","What a great story! Schizophrenia seems to have been a condition associated with murderers and the like. This movie has shown that it can get anyone - even a genius, and somehow it takes the stigma from the condition. The only disappointment for was that I wanted to know more about Mrs Nash. She was the real hero of the story for mine. I wanted to know more about how John's delusions affected her. Still, it was a great movie that hopefully helped make us all a little less ignorant of mental illness."

","This movie deserves a 8/10 rating.Especially Ron Howard has done an excellent job.Also by Jennifer Connelly and of course Akiva Goldsman.But I don't understand what this fuss about Russell Crowe is all about. Of course, there is no doubt that he did an excellent job in this movie and he deserved a nomination he got but then it all ends there itself. Honestly, I don't think he even deserved the Oscar for 'GLADIATOR'. The movie totally belonged to Ridley Scott and the Visual Effects Supervisors.Perhaps as a personal opinion of me, the best performance by Russell Crowe was in the two movies 'L.A. CONFIDENTIAL' and 'THE INSIDER' for which he deserved an Oscar (which is didn't win).Actually speaking the above FOUR(including 'A BEAUTIFUL MIND') are the only SENSIBLE movies, which Crowe could be credited for, till today(at the time of writing this comment).<br/><br/>Compared to Crowe check out the List of some of the SENSIBLE movies of Denzel Washington :CRY FREEDOM, GLORY, A SOLDIER'S STORY, MALCOLM X, PELICAN BRIEF, PHILADELPHIA, CRIMSON TIDE, COURAGE UNDER FIRE, FALLEN, THE SIEGE, THE HURRICANE, TRAINING DAY(which was not a great movie but a great performance which rightfully deserved an Oscar) and there's lot more to come...And Washington has been sensible from the start of his career and NOT just the last THREE years. Best of luck to Crowe as he now face-to-face and will be in the future with a formidable WALL called Denzel Washington."
"sickdroogy","6","0","1","29 March 2002"," A Hollywood-sized Lie
","""A Beautiful Mind"" is safe, conservative, Hollywood pap. It's not challenging, interesting, or even remotely intellectually satisfying. The film ""confronts"" schizophrenia by sugarcoating the truth with take-my-breath-away, ""Sixth Sense""-style revelations following straightforward (and egregiously inaccurate) visual hallucinations. The film claims that a scrambled mind can use that scrambled mind to unscramble it with the support and love of a good woman. It's an inexcusable lie, and irresponsible with respect to the truly horrific reality of schizophrenia. The film picked the perfect formula: take a real man's story, strip away everything but his name, pretend to deal with a deep issue (like mental illness), alter it to make it more palatable to mainstream audiences, slap on a happy ending, and open your arms for a slew of awards.  It is mushy, manipulative tripe and the worst Best Picture in recent memory."

","I had just watched it not long ago and I really think that it is a great movie... ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a biopic about John Nash's life. The movie starts as John Nash as in his graduate year in Princeton University. Although he lacks of social life skills (especially the scene when he told the ""blonde"" girl at the pub that they need some kind of affection before they can get together on the bed, which soon, landed him with a slap by the ""blonde girl""), does not believe in attending classes and wants to have an original idea of his own, he is a brillant guy who also does not believe in failures, which eventually, his first theory was soon recognised by his lecturer, his naturalness of breaking the code for The Pentagon (and later, his early developed of paraniod schizophrenia because of a lot of stress). Later in his life, he was soon, teaching in the MIT where he met his ever-first girlfriend, Alicia Nash, and got married. John, who is very contented with his work and life, soon met a mysterious man named William Parcher and not sooner, his life had turned upside down, which eventually landed him in a psychiatry hospital and his diagnosis is paraniod schizophrenia, which later, went through many treatments. His decline for the medication eventually led him and his family into almost 'shattered glass' but still, with his support of his wife and everybody, his triumph had come into his way: He was awarded the Nobel Prize Award For Economics in the year 1994. This is a great show, acted by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. It had a touching storyline at the another half of the show, sense of humour and the right coordination of both music and special effects (for example, giving me to know a little of how John Nash's mind works). For those who haven't, go and watch it!"
"uramean1","10","0","1","28 March 2002"," Russell Crowe is a Beautiful Mind
","In any movie the stars always take control of our lives for a couple of hours. But a great actor takes complete control until you idealize them and beg for more, more, more..I put Russell Crowe way up top that pedestal. You might say that to high for Russell Crowe but I say not. You had to see him five times to detect his all the theatrical tricks and see the artistry of a real genius. For in art and in literature, as it is, yes, in sports, it's the difference that really counts. In The Gladiator, Russell Crowe was all hunk and is ready to kill or die anytime, giving his life for the justice. He was all the raw rippling power of a professional warrior, all that a man could ever want to be. He fears neither man nor beast. Filled with faith for God and Country. In The Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe was the unlikely nerd in college, sexy professor, and - lo and behold! an old man-Crowe as John Nash.  A mathematical genius trapped in the wild world of schizophrenia, and the gladiator had completely disappeared. It brought me to tears and had the theater applauding at the end.  That was something I have seen since Gone with the Wind. Now that's a Winning combination and will always keep me coming back."

","I watched this movie after it won 4 Oscars, but I would have seen it anyway, I think. I had possibly avoided it because of the subject matter, in that, whilst not being scizophrenic, I have endured my own mental problems in my time. The Oscar ceremony persuaded me to see what all the fuss was about. I am so glad that I made that decision. I am very relieved it beat the likes of 'Moulin Rouge' and 'The Lord of the Rings' for, although I thought that both of those films were good, neither deserved to be considered as 'best film'. Personally, 'Amelie' was my favourite film of the year, but 'A Beautiful Mind' has to be the best film. I was quite shocked by the depth of Russell Crowe's talent. It's a shame he won the Oscar last year - I thought Tom Hanks should have won for 'Castaway'. Had he not done so, I'm sure he would have scooped the award this year. I've not seen 'Training Day' but this role demanded acting on many different levels. Crowe dominates the film with his performance; the perfect contrast of the brains versus the brawn of 'Gladiator'. Actually, if anything, I think his menacing thug-cop in 'LA Confidential' was a better performance than in 'Gladiator'. Anyway, apart from Crowe, I cannot fathom why Jennifer Connely did not win a Best Actress Oscar. Is there a screen time presence rule? If not, I feel she should have won in that category. I haven't previously particularly liked Ron Howard films, and I thought 'The Grinch' was pretty dire, but his direction is perfect here. It may not be totally factually accurate but it made for great film-making. For a while, whilst on a 'high' leaving the cinema, I couldn't think of a better movie. 9/10."

Good as Denzel Washington was, it was obviously the BAFTA affair that cost Rusty the Oscar. So far ahead of the field with this towering performance, the Academy has cost itself total credibility by overlooking him. Granted, Crowe's behaviour was untenable but that should never have been any business of the Academy who are there solely to judge performances not social etiquette. I don't think I have ever seen an actor immerse himself so deeply in a role. His performance in GLADIATOR for example, though dignified, interesting and beautifully executed could never measure up to this mighty effort. It was the film itself that won it for him I believe. Here, he IS the film itself. I found his performance at times somewhat reminiscent of his role as the harassed Wiggins in THE INSIDER. (which should also have taken out Best Actor)<br/><br/>So much to take in here. With Crowe such a dynamic focus, it is easy to lose sight of other things. I thought Jennifer Connolly was beautifully natural, she is such a cutie! Without giving anything away, I would like to say that the two highlights of the film for me were Prof Nash saying ""goodbye"" to his friend's very young niece and his line ""Have you met Harvey?"" which must have gone over the heads of everyone less than 40! Crowe's mastery of facial expressions, hand movements..even the ""walk"" of John Nash brought to the fore the true art of ""acting"" here. <br/><br/>A film requiring multiple viewings, it will be for many, an incredibly emotional experience.

","Empiricists are prone to simply place a label on something that cannot be quantified or qualified by sense perception and then to construct a mythology around it. This is the case in the science of human behavior. Abnormal behavior that is not understood, such as schizophrenia is labeled and categorized per its attending syndrome. Its symtomology is then attacked by various therapeutic methods and chemical concoctions, some which are more harmful to the patient than the so-called illness itself.<br/><br/>In this exquisite film the protagonist suffers from schizophrenia as diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Yet, the film is not about the illness as much as it is about an extraordinary man who is quite different from most of us, a man who has far greater use of his brain than perhaps 99.9% of the rest of us. It is about his triumph despite the ""malady"".<br/><br/>However, this malady, as seen by some metaphysicians takes on a more interesting casting. After Albert Einstein the entire world we thought we knew came up for grabs. In this new arena where temporal reality is invalidated and matter revealed as pure energy, where time and space are inextricably bonded and labeled illusory the astute metaphysician has no alternative but to see some abnormal behaviors as perhaps something far more profound than a dysfunction of the brain.<br/><br/>As seen here, in this very best work thus far of Ron Howard after a director's career of excellence we are given the latitude to question the nature of the ""illness"" called schizophrenia. We are also shown interweaving realities as perceived by an extraordinary mind and what happens when that mind meets the rest of us."

""A Beautiful Mind"" comes to theaters 3 or 4 times a year, usually around November when the teenage-boy vehicles clear out, all other American demographics pack inside and everyone blindly embraces the ""it"" film of the year.  Hollywood lifts itself on its shoulders and pats its own back for a job well done.<br/><br/>I recognize the elegance but resist the blueprint.  I would rather gush over a movie that moves me through its originality and daring."

","Again, I won't recycle the plot of this movie since it's well covered below, just to say that this is a good, although nearly fictional Hollywood biopic. Ron Howard is trying to put a human face on mental illness and prove even the most ostracized, alienated of people still yearn for the basic feelings of love, acceptance and relevance in this world. Akiva Goldsman's script is serviceable, though there are several phony moments, character actions and speeches that don't hit home. In other words, it has that ""Only-in-Hollywood"" mentality that stretches credibility to the limit.<br/><br/>The most deserving of it's four Oscars was the one that went to Jennifer Connelly, while nearly everyone who stepped up to the podium praised Russell Crowe and said they wouldn't be there without him. Crowe is of course, fine as always, but Ms. Connelly is every bit as responsible for the film's success and critical praise as Crowe. She's the genuine heart of this movie, generates a lot of emotion through simple facial expressions and obviously put a great deal of care and heart into this performance. It shines through and keeps this uneven film grounded most of the time.<br/><br/>My score: 7 out of 10."

","This movie is really great and it is TOO great to be true.I don't have any idea how much of it was real and how much was added by imagination(ofcourse with the permission of the real character: John Nash ) by Akiva Goldsman,but it truly deserved the Academy Awards for the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress.I think that Crowe's performance too was GREAT.But I think that the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role deservedly went to Denzel Washington who has done a terrific job in Training Day.That Denzel Washington should have won it long back is an altogether different issue.For anyone who thinks that the Oscar juries' decision for the Best Actor is biased, I think that opinion is ridiculous.The Juries take their decisions strictly by MERIT and nothing else.Russell Crowe's performance was great but that of Denzel Washington's was greater.<br/><br/>  Ironically, NOBODY took any objection when : 1. Raging Bull lost to Ordinary People in the (1980-81) Academy Awards. 2. Very less people raised their eyebrows when Shakespeare In Love was preferred to Saving Private Ryan for the year (1998-99). 3.Also what about the decision when Kevin Spacey won inspite of Denzel Washington's mighty performance in the title role of 'The Hurricane(1999)' ??? Acording to me the above three decisions were questionable(and there are still some more too but that's enough for now.) So I think that any objection to Denzel's win is merely either due to jealousy or due to lack of acknowledgement to superior talent.<br/><br/>Anyway,this movie is something we can call a MASTERPIECE and I give it a 8/10 rating."

","Though this movie looked pretty good in the previews, I wasn't entirely anxious to see it until Oscar time was approaching.  Until then, I felt ""In the Bedroom"" deserved the Best Picture Oscar, Tom Wilkinson for Best Actor and Marisa Tomei for Best Supporting Actress.  I just had the impression that ""A Beautiful Mind"" would be one of those overblown melodramas that suck up to the Academy.  Well, after finally watching this film, my opinions were altered completely.  I'm sure if Russell Crowe didn't start any emotional outbursts, he would've certainly won for Best Actor.  I love Denzel Washington, and he was great in ""Training Day,"" but he played a ruthless villain and his role didn't have many dimensions.  As Richard Roeper said, Denzel had the opportunity to ham it up a little.  But I guess the Academy wanted to be PC this year and have two African-American actors--him and Halle Berry--step up to the podium.  But I'm still grateful that the movie won Best Picture and Ron Howard (finally!) won Best Director. <br/><br/>
Crowe not only had to fake an American accent, but also fake a West Virginian accent--one that I imagine even an American actor would have difficulty with.  He is incredible as the schizophrenic John Nash, who you feel a deeper sympathy for as the film moves along.  Lots of actors have played mentally challenged characters, but schitzophrenia is a disorder with many dimensions and Crowe was entirely believable.  I'm sure he did tons of research for the role, and it shows.  Jennifer Connelly is a charming, slightly underrated actress who many are unfamiliar with simply because she's starred in mainly independent works.  She is not only beautiful to watch, but gives the best performance of her career, and her Oscar is well-deserved.  <br/><br/>The film is long, but never overlong.  I was so fully engaged, journeying through the brilliant but troubled mind of John Nash, that time ceased to exist.  And of course, anytime a brilliant film like this is released, there's always going to be a cult interested in reducing the hype by pointing out minor flaws in the story.  According to these people, the film failed to include certain elements of Nash's life, making it not entirely accurate.  This a movie!  Not a documentary!  Have you ever seen a biopic that was ENTIRELY accurate?  I don't know much about Nash's life.  All I know is his life inspired a wonderful motion picture.  Hell, I can point out certain flaws myself.  The speech Nash gives at the end was obviously doctored for dramatic purposes and I'm pretty sure the librarians at Nash's college would've kicked him out the library for marking up their windows. But this is such an amazing, touching film that I really don't care, and I'm sure most audiences will feel the same way.  <br/><br/>My score:  9 (out of 10)"

I won't give away secrets, but the less you know about it going in the better. This movie does let you into the mind of its lead character and really makes you consider your own perceptions and realities. Are we really here? Am I really typing. Picking apart this film for minute factual content or leaving out alleged details of the main characters sexuality is totally churlish and unnecessary.<br/><br/>See and love this movie. It works completely well as a piece of stand alone fiction inspired by a true story. Jennifer Connelly is stunning as usual (I question an Oscar for her, but she is effective) and there is a brilliant supporting role by the always enjoyable Ed Harris.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind will stand in time as a worthy Best Picture.

","I don't really dislike this movie, but giving it Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay!!! Come on, Academy, snap out of it: let's try giving the award to something that really deserves it and not something that is merely worthy.<br/><br/>Although A Beautiful Mind is well made (Roger Deakins' cinematography in particular being a standout), it is not in the same class as fellow nominees In The Bedroom, Lord of the Rings, Gosford Park and Moulin Rouge. All of these other movies take enormous risks, inflame passions and debate, and look like labours of love. Ron Howard's movie, regardless of the makers' intentions, comes over as a well intentioned but flatly earnest big budget made for TV issues movie. At it's worst, the movie is more about emotional manipulation than it is about producer Brian Grazer's aim of opening a window on understanding mental illness.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe has done much better work than on show here (and, deservedly, lost out to Denzel Washington for Best Actor); and Ron Howard himself has produced better movies like Ransom and Apollo 13; even his underrated The Paper is much better than this. That Howard at his least effective has beaten directors like Altman, Jackson, and Scott at their peak does not reflect well on the Academy's judgement.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, however, what does it actually mean? The history of the Oscars is littered with movies which lost out but are more memorable than the winners: Raging Bull, Jaws, It's A Wonderful Life, Psycho (hell, Hitchcock never ever won an Oscar - what does that tell us?), The Searchers, etc, etc, so it will not surprise me when, in a few years, this movie has been largely forgotten or reevaluated for it's true worth (a la English Patient) while Rings, Rouge, Bedroom and Park will stand unblemished as the true master classes in making stimulating cinema that they really are.<br/><br/>6/10"

It's certainly not a really bad movie it's just horribly middle of the road and only ever generates small moments of interest in an overlong plodding story. The subject should have been shown a lot more respect and also been given to a director with courage to show the whole story, rather than this sanitised version. <br/><br/>Apart from maybe Apollo 13, Howard's films have frequently been too safe and bland and unsurprisingly this is no exception. What should have been a memorable fascinating story about a very complex man is littered with so much pap dialog, sentimentality and swirling orchestration, we end up not caring about anyone. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor as he has proven in most of his previous incarnations, but with this role he really needed a braver film maker to let him loose again. <br/><br/>For lessons in how to film the story of a troubled mind, remember gems like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Jacobs Ladder - both far from sentimental but both totally moving and un-forgettable."

","First things first: this is clearly *not* a biopic of John Nash. So what's the story, you ask? Isn't it about the ironic combination of genius and schizophrenia? Well no, not really. Rather, it *uses* that combination to illustrate the real story, which is an allegory about those Great American Topics, conspiracy theory and The Cold War. (As such, it's entitled not to bother mentioning certain politically incorrect aspects of his personality such as his (claimed) anti-Semitism and bisexuality, so I think the critics who have been panning it for misrepresentation are missing the point.)<br/><br/>So, does it paint a convincing picture? Yes, undeniably. We're swept right into Nash's view of the world. Solid performances from Russell Crowe and Ed Harris with reliable occasional support from Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer help a lot here, and although Jennifer Connelly's cardboard cut-out devoted wife doesn't add any dramatic punch, I think we can blame the scriptwriter for that. The hard maths behind Nash's early burst of genius is skipped right over, alas, but then those Hollywood folks never did care much for science and logic. (Is maths science? I can't answer that and I *am* (or was) a mathematician.)<br/><br/>8/10. But a Best Actor Oscar nomination? Crowe is good here, but not *that* good. Is the competition really that poor?<br/><br/>(P.S. I wrote that just before the Oscars. Well I was right in the end, wasn't I? But I was wrong too, about Connelly. Oh pleeeease.

","What do you get when you assemble the geniality from Geoffrey Rush in ""Shine"", the intonation from Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman"" and the clothing ethics from Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump""? You get Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind a.k.a. John Nash, a brilliant mathmetician that keeps seeing (dead anyone?:-) people around him. Although I didn't agree with last year's oscarwinning role in Gladiator, I do believe that A Beautiful Mind gives Crowe the stage where he shows his acting ability to the highest level seen in recent years. The movie is a delightful adaptation from the original biography, althought it must be said that most facts have been interpreted ""politically correct"", unfortunately leaving out lesser flattering, but imperative facts about the life of John Nash.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly, playing the role of supporting partner to a lesser fortunate soul, gives another great performance after gems like Requiem for a Dream & Pollock. Although she didn't convince me of the fact that she was a brilliant mathmetician, she did play the role of supporting half to the utmost possible level. Her beauty is unparallelled in recent years by any other actress, and even at the end of the movie when she's transformed into an older lady, all the make-up in the world couldn't make her lesser attractive!<br/><br/>Ron Howard delivers a moving, mindbuggling bioepic that will have a profound effect on anyone that will come across it.

","Ron Howard, a Hollywood veteran who started as a child actor, has been working his way up as a director from featherweight material ('Splash', 'Cocoon') to more dramatic subjects ('The Paper', 'Apollo 13'), though with a fairly light touch ('Edtv'). Here he has come up with a sanitised biopic of John Nash, the brilliant but schizophrenic Princeton mathematician who won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on game theory done many years earlier. Being an old hand, Howard knows no-one never went broke not challenging his audience's intelligence and the significance of Nash's work is explained as a strategy for picking up women in bars. Russell Crowe as Nash keeps it as obvious as he can, with lots of muttering and strange moving about. Naturally there is a love interest in the form of Nash's wife, played nicely by Jennifer Connelly, and some loyal friends, but unfortunately some of Nash's imaginary friends are more interesting than the real ones.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to know just how much work Nash really did for the Pentagon as a breaker of military codes. It is implied the code-breaking work, which he did after obtaining his doctorate, helped push Nash over the edge, but it emerges that he was suffering from delusions even before he left Princeton. Howard's little trick of holding back on the truth about Nash's true state of mind does help us to see things from Nash's perspective, but it also confuses the story. The really interesting thing, which is not adequately explored, is the genius/madman interface. We have plenty of mad people but not too many geniuses, so what is the relationship? All Nash knows is that, stuffed up with pills he may not suffer from delusions and keep quiet but he is not good for much else  even his sex life suffers. <br/><br/>The early inappropriate treatment, insulin shock 'therapy' from Dr Rosen (Christopher Plummer) gave way to less catastrophic medication, but it seems his best work was done before he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. In remission, he was allowed to hang around Princeton and eventually was able to write and teach again, but the early genius does not seem to have returned. Princeton it seems got a bargain  a Nobel Prize from someone who was too cracked to put on the full-time payroll.<br/><br/>Because this is a strictly commercial movie it has to be judged on its entertainment and box office value rather than its contribution to human thought. Howard is quite adventurous in serving up to the great movie-going public a biopic of someone from such an arcane area as pure mathematics, but he does not fail them  there is enough sentiment to satisfy all and a tiny kernel of intellectual interest to satisfy the tiny fraction of us who like that sort of thing in our movies. Russell Crowe, who apparently did not meet Nash until shooting was finished, does a sort of madder version of his 'Insider' character. Crowe and the make-up people handle the aging of his character well (not so Jennifer Connelly who is unrecognisable in her last scenes) but because most of the drama is earlier on, the last few scenes set years later fall a bit flat. 'Enigma' (not yet released in the US) is a much more exciting mathematical espionage story, albeit an old-time thriller. No doubt Oscars will be won, and Howard acclaimed as an artistic genius for what is really just stolid Hollywood entertainment."

Take a man who is a bit uncomfortable in society, a man who is devastating in his intelligence and sadly lacking in people skills and make him ill, make him have audio and visual hallucinations and you have a potent individual. Russell Crowe is for want of a better word, beautiful, in his portrayal of this outsider, who struggles in a society he doesn't understand nor does he want to. But then by now we expect only fantastic things from Mr. Crowe. The movie follows his life from Princeton all the way through until he wins the Nobel Prize for economics.  I won't say more because it would give away plot points. <br/><br/>As for acting, there is not one person in this movie who is not impressive in their roles. Ed Harris never lets you down, as a tough talking shadowy government figure, Jennifer Connely is heartbreaking as the woman who loves Nash, but struggles to understand what is happening to him, the whole cast deserves an award for a great assemble.  <br/><br/>This movie is great because it takes an honest look at schizophrenia; it allows us to empathize with John Nash, but not necessarily like him.

I believe this way Nash would live longer in our memory; we'll always remember the young Nash fighting his demons and running up the dark corridors toward the light and becoming stronger with every attempt.

Although plagued by mental illness for years, his intellectual brilliance survived through it all. The movie does well to combine John Nash's world of reality and delusion...something that was indivisible for him as a person. One realizes toward the end of the movie that he represented a ""communion of contrasts"": on the one hand a person with ""superior"" intellectual skills, and on the other hand, a person with a mind illness that made him ""inferior"" to ordinary people.

"bronx58","10","0","1","25 December 2001"," A thing of beauty indeed! Simply amazing!
","Simply beautiful!!!  This film is without a doubt one of the best I've ever seen!  I was treated to a preview of this beautiful film in advance of its opening.  Like some of the others who have submitted reviews here, I too was completely thrown off by the trailer for the film.  I expected to find a mediocre love story taking place in the midst of some kind of quasi-thriller.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  This movie delivers on so many levels.  It was indeed a thriller (although of a different sort)...and also delivered as a love story on several levels.  Yes, the beautiful and talented Mr. Crowe affects what was in my opinion a convincing enough West Virginia accent, but more mind blowing was seeing him adapt his mannerisms, posture, and gait to the various ages, and stages, of Mr. Nash's life.  His performance was brilliantly subtle, yet right on the money.  What more can I say?  The man is a truly amazing actor!  Truly gifted!  As for other aspects of the film...there are those who find Ron Howard's style of directing to be somewhat heavy handed in attempting to extract emotions from the moviegoer - I don't necessarily share that opinion.  I prefer to think that his films are imbued with ""heart.""  I enjoy his work, and I feel that this film especially was directed with a truly artistic touch.  I never felt as though I'd been manipulated.  On the contrary, I felt as though I'd had the privilege of being allowed on a very special and exclusive journey, and found the experience uplifting.  The film allows the viewer to peer into a great mind gone haywire...and to watch him use his genius to put it back together again.  It allows us to share in some of the challenges and uncertainty which exist in the daily lives of those who have a loved one with this type of illness.  To see Mr. Crowe's oh so subtle, very realistic, portrayal not only of what a schizophrenic experiences mentally - but how he appears to those watching from the outside...well, this was truly awesome! He masterfully avoided going overboard with the role.  Playing John Nash with quiet dignity...not at all over the top.  Both Mr. Crowe and Ms. Connelly bring tremendous honesty to their roles.  I was truly impressed seeing the love, the resoluteness, and at the same time the weariness that settles in under such circumstances on a long suffering mate, all flawlessly portrayed by Jennifer Connelly.  She took us through the gamut of emotions that Alicia Nash must have experienced.  In the ""first date"" scenes, Ms. Connelly is a vision, and throughout the film she is the embodiment of grace and beauty.  Also worth mentioning, Ed Harris turns in yet another solid performance as the very creepy government agent.  Paul Bettany is a real scene stealer as Nash's roommate and confidant.  The score is simply beautiful and sets the proper mood at all times.  The film is visually stunning.  I can't see how this film won't snag Academy Award nominations all around, but especially for Russell Crowe and for Jennifer Connelly. Crowe should definitely take home another Oscar for this one!  Please!  Do yourself a favor and see this film if you haven't already...and if you have then see it again - I just did!"

"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","6","0","1","17 March 2002"," Like all awardscoopers overrated.
","It's got the Golden Globes and it's got the Oscar nominations so it can't be that good, right? The tendency I have is, frankly, to be very sceptical about this kind of award-winning film because the Oscars tend to be little more than a popularity contest. And if you look at a list of the big Oscar winners of the last decade(s) you'll see it hardly ever is the year's best movie getting the Best Film award (see for example American Beauty beating the likes of Magnolia and The Insider while Fight Club wasn't even nominated). Usually the awards are given to some babyboom-appealing toothless film about triumph over adversity with massive studio backing. Well, when you read A Beautiful Mind's tagline, you pretty much get the idea it's purely aimed at forking in the Golden Baldies. So, is it as good as the award ceremonies would have you believe or it as bad as I thought it would be?<br/><br/>The answer is: it's neither. There's a lot wrong with this, A LOT. I haven't read the book either (although the film's, uhm, 'cinematic' portrayal of Nash has brought reading it to my interest - when I get around to it, I'll read it) so there might be more wrong with it. What I do know, is that a lot of Nash's unpleasant sides have been left out of the film. We get the paranoid schizophrenia but his personal relationships (apparantly, Nash divorced his wife, only to remarry her forty years later) are sometimes skipped, as well as his bisexuality (this could have been about a bisexual genuis schizophrenic? - I would have been SO there). The point is, although the filmmakers, for some (cowardly?) reason leave out his bisexuality but do decide to insert a car chase (of all things). A Beautiful Mind is a crossover movie somewhere halfway a thriller and halfway a drama. Had they made it a mere drama by enriching the relationships in the film (the one between Nash and his wife is far too one-dimensional) I might have bought it. Had they made it a full-blown conspiracy/ schizophrenia thriller, I might have bought it. I don't buy the mixture perse. The thriller elements seem thrown in for audience entertainment alone and the human drama, under the decidly lightweight direction of Ron Howard, doesn't hit home hard enough. Plus, anyone (especially anyone who's seen one particular movie mentioned in this comment) will see the big twist coming and the movie drags toward the end. And one question continues to bug me today: did Nash, a brilliant man, really give that schmaltzy speech at the Nobel prize ceremony (if you know, please email me)?<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's performance is one that's there to please the Oscar audience. He's a genuis schizophrenic and Crowe does almost everything a role like Nash's requires. Every little gesture is there, the accent is near-flawless and he even acts well while in heavy layers of make-up. It is a fairly self-conscious performance, on the other hand, aimed directly at nabbing the awards. Give Denzel the Oscar. No, the real deal is delivered by Jennifer Connely, possibly Hollywood's most underrated actress. Anyone having a role as cliched as hers and anyone having to deliver those horrible lines and inject some real human emotion into it, really does deserve an Oscar. Ed Harris is good, but has an even more thankless role. Paul Bettany is great fun and injects some much-needed spirit into a film about, frankly, a bloody rude man.<br/><br/>The strange thing is, even though it's a straight and simple story about a brilliant man coming to terms with his environment and, far more importantly, himself, I didn't dislike it at all. I can break it down like any other Oscar-friendly far-too-feelgooder, but in the end I did care for the film's version of John Nash and his wife. I thought the scientific concepts were adequately handled (it's not trying to be a history lesson, and not a maths course either) and you can't go wrong with a cinematographer like Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie may be a mess of historical trivia on Nash's life and some narrative trickery more suited to a more surreal film, but it is entertaining. So, please, give the awards to some really good films and accept this film for what it is: average.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

"b-a-h TNT-6","6","0","1","17 March 2002"," Yep, intelligence is a terrible thing to waste...
","'Saccharine' is one of those adjectives that moviegoers use and abuse. I don't consider myself one that abuses it: although I do get irritated when watching phony sentimentality, I do not mind movies that aim for the heart. Honestly, I don't even mind movies that get a little manipulative in this respect, unless of course the manipulation is downright insulting (and sadly, it is not that rare).<br/><br/>Now, are you a fan of plot twists? Because I am going to start with one in this review already: forget about the word 'saccharine', because A Beautiful Mind, despite what a few people said, did manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence by inserting too many syrupy scenes. The bad news is, however, that this has brought a denouement about Howard's real capabilities. Quite frankly, he has not matured into the awesome director they want us to see.<br/><br/>What's that? You're saying that the aforementioned plot twist was not very good? Well, you will not find much better in the film.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind tells the fictionalized story of John Nash (Russell Crowe), Noble prize winner who struggled for most of his life with schizophrenia. In the beginning of the film, we meet Nash as a student in Princeton. He is a strange individual, apparently shy and volatile; he often speaks his mind out loud and ends up being ridiculed by students with better social skills. Apparently, Nash is also experiencing troubles with his studies, but he is constantly looking for a revolutionary idea that would permit him to be remembered as an innovator and good mathematician. One day, in a bar where he is putting into mathematics a method to pick up girls, he comes up with a theory so revolutionary that, in the future, the world of economics and beyond will literally be changed by it.<br/><br/>Years later, following the success of his theory, Nash is working for a government agency and is a professor at the Massachuttes Institute of Technology; here, he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and falls in love with her. However, for Nash life is not as easy as it sounds, as soon he -- and the viewers -- will get to learn that part of his world is not quite what he thinks. He is suffering from schizophrenia, and with the progressive degeneration of it both his love life and his work as a mathematician are at risk of being destroyed forever. Will love and genius triumph over tragedy?<br/><br/>OK, this last question sounds a little overdone and goofy, but it is not so dissimilar from level of depth that A Beautiful Mind maintains through the film. The problem with A Beautiful Mind is not so much that the film takes liberties with John Nash's story, but rather that these liberties are the result of poor presentation and weak ideas.<br/><br/>I have never read in its entirety the book that tells the real (not fictionalized) story of John Nash, but I am aware that the nature of some of his hallucinations is not played the way it is played in the film; the clear boundaries between reality and delusions are suppressed in the film to surprise the viewer with a plot twist. Fine, I am a fan of plot twists when they add something in terms of significance, but here it is clearly done only for entertainment value. The same can be said about many events in Nash's real life that in the movie are skipped, distorted or changed. It is clear that the aim of A Beautiful Mind is not to change a true story in order to explore the mind of a troubled genius, but rather to present a product as clean and accessible to the public as possible. And while this has apparently guaranteed big cash and the Academy consideration, it didn't fool me. You see, Howard's Cocoon did not have ambitions to be much more than a fairy tale, and on that level it was perfectly enjoyable. A Beautiful Mind is not a fairy tale, and I think we should expect a little more than a story where everything is on the surface.<br/><br/>I am not condemning the fact that A Beautiful Mind took a true story and fictionalized it, but rather the fact that it did not do so to add levels of depth to it; it did so to make it the most commercially palatable. Symbolism, psychical discourses, and mathematics are pretty much completely absent, and the glimpses of Nash's genius are put on screen through 'romanticized', computer-generated visual effects; anything that could have possibly disturbed the public has been removed. I am quite positive that even a documentary-like approach to John Nash's story would have given more insight about the human mind and more though-provoking material. A Beautiful Mind is not a terrible motion picture, it is a terribly average motion picture, one that would have satisfied me if it was a made-for-TV production.<br/><br/>The acting is satisfying. Crowe, who inexplicably won last year for his mediocre portrayal of Maximus in Gladiator, is up for another Oscar this year. His work here is certainly good, but not great. Jennifer Connelly has been better before, but she is equally satisfying.<br/><br/>Sadly, A Beautiful Mind cannot be recommended, and the fact that it was nominated for multiple Academy Awards probably puts a final word about the real meaning I give to the Oscars.<br/><br/>6/10"

"teejayniles2345","10","0","1","14 March 2002"," Why ""MIND"" will win the TOP OSCAR March 24
","The 2001 Ron Howard film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, is more than a front runner in the race for a Best Picture Academy Award.  It's the most traditional, logical, and emotional Best Picture among the major feature-length films vying in the category for that Hollywood ""gold medal"" triumph.  This significant ""team product"" (Universal Studios, DreamWorks, and Imagine Entertainment) deserves the endorsement that only the top Oscar can convey! As a ""traditional"" pick, consider how this 2 1/2 hour film advances an invigorating ""happy ending"" format.  The episodic chronicle of a mentally challenged individual, John Nash, and his long-suffering, supportive wife, Sylvia, neither ends with gloom nor doom.  Some might object that such recent winners as AMADEUS and THE ENGLISH PATIENT ended with death by overwork, plane crashes, and euthanasia; however, their popular source material from novel or stage play dictated the outcome of their main characters, respectively.  The typical American outlook is one of victory despite obstacles of all sorts.  This winning depiction of a delusional schizophreniac even includes his Acceptance Speech at the Nobel Prize ceremonies in 1994.  Like memorable and typical Hollywood biographies, this film offers basically glimpses of an overall success story.  The Nash family remains held together despite extreme medical and psychiatric crises. Opponents of this film's sweep onto the 3/24 Victory Stand/Stage in Hollywood point out that the depicted couple actually divorced and separated, only later reconciling.  Tradition favors memories of an uncomplicated nature and this film has an ""uneasy"" connection to what's real and what's not real at all.  If it wins because of its comforting attitude, voters may sweep along to Best Actor and Best Director awards Russell Crowe and Ron Howard as they did when RAIN MAN, Dustin Hoffman, and Barry Levinson took home Oscars. Secondly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the most logical pick out of the primary competition (GOSFORD PARK, MOULIN ROUGE, and THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING).  The Academy will likely be supportive of American-focused material for this first ceremony after the national tragedy of September 11, 2001; they'd perhaps promote the New Jersey-set film over those set in England and Paris (GOSFORD & MOULIN ROUGE).  Other films with minor nominations have settings in the U.S.: MEMENTO, ALI, MONSTER'S BALL, and TRAINING DAY;  I predict that some of these will spoil the races in several of the categories with their strongest performances or technical accomplishments.  Voters of the Academy logically might be holding off any recognition of the first-of-three installments of THE LORD OF THE RINGS saga.  Two more films will debut at Christmas 2002 and 2003.  Like STAR WARS, STAR TREK, and INDIANA JONES, they might win at the box office while never taking home the Best Picture statuette. Thirdly, A BEAUTIFUL MIND packs an emotional wallop but yet doesn't fully flatten its audience.  When I recently viewed certain of its most gripping sequences (in Nash's padded room or insulin therapy lab and in the small family bathroom), I was amazed at the overwhelmingly effective nature of the film's depiction of the ravages of mental illness.  There was so much raw power on the screen; still, we cared about all the individuals involved without losing our connection to the story and its graphically depicted extremes.  To contrast, the independently produced nominee, IN THE BEDROOM, took its audience on a roller-coaster ride that did ""hit the solar plexus."" Its pure realism about modern-day violence, from a short story by Andre Dubus deserved full recognition in this mega-category.  Its chance to play ""David"" among the other ""Goliaths"" is hard to predict, at least right now. Older voters, a majority of Academy members, would favor some emotion without feeling immobilized and stunned senseless by it, in my opinion. In conclusion, A BEAUTIFUL MIND deserves the highest award on March 24 because of its conventional approach to an American success story, its logical preference to a ""Middle-Earth"" fantasy epic, and its emotional punch that moves us to terrain where we can catch our breath without wheezing in dire pain.  When all is said and done, this Ron Howard-Brian Grazer production may not win all of its nominations but it stands the greatest chance of taking home the ""gold"" -- the Oscar for Best Picture 2001."

As you watch the film you can see the main events happen through the eyes of John Nash himself, but it is not until later in the film that you realise what you are seeing is the gradual onset of his illness.

And this is a true story! Russell Crowe shows why he's a versatile actor by portraying Nash with sensitivity and passion. Jennifer Connelly did an excellent job as the woman who thought she was married to an eccentric man and did not leave his side after finding out about his illness. Ed Harris, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer did a fine job in their supporting role of ""explaining and showing"" the mindset of a schizophrenic. Trying to tell this story is not an easy task yet director Ron Howard did it without resorting to sensationalism. This movie gave me an insight of what a schizophrenic goes through on a daily life; not being able to distinguish between what's real and what's reality is frightening or using one's energy to push away the illusion is exhausting.

Welcome to Ron Howard's world, where the techniques of film making are so encumbered by the demands of mainstream movie America that one feels as if he's seen this movie already. And you have.  If you've seen any film about someone overcoming a mental illness to deliver an uplifting message about the triumph of the human spirit, you've seen ""A Beautiful Mind.""  It's paint by numbers film making.  All of the required scenes are there---I felt as if I needed a little checklist so that I could tick them off as I went. <br/><br/>
Russell Crowe does o.k. with his role, though it's mostly a collection of physical tricks rather than a fully fleshed out performance.  I don't know why everyone's going nuts over Jennifer Connelly.  She's adequate, but nothing more, and she isn't given a lot to do as Nash's stoic wife.<br/><br/>Nash's schizophrenia is handled with sledgehammer subtlety by Howard.  The movie could and should have been much shorter had whole scenes detailing Nash's hallucinations been left on the cutting room floor.  I'm sorry Ed Harris---I like you, but your whole performance could have been left out and the movie would be unchanged.<br/><br/>Howard treats mental illness like it's a new topic that's never been dealt with before.  He's caught Steven Spielberg syndrome---it's as if he suddenly feels it's his duty to bring awareness to ""serious"" topics, but he handles them in such a shameless way, and gives his audience such little credit for being able to understand and appreciate nuance (let alone have a genuine emotional response) that his movies are becoming progressively tedious and boring.<br/><br/>I'm waiting for ""Parenthood 2.""  Let Howard get back on familiar terrain."

","Without giving anything away, I was amazed at Ron Howard's film technique to out Hitchcock, Hitchcock!  The viewer becomes highly, intimately involved with the lead character's condition by seeing what John Forbes Nash sees -unknowingly at first then surprisingly and brilliantly revealed without being tricked or melodramatic. The early treatment of mental illness, in this case schizophrenia, is graphically presented and portrayed, encompassing all the victims-both the person affected and the family/friends dealing with their loved one.  It is not preachy, yet it teaches as much  as any book or informative lecture(s).<br/><br/>Nuanced performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris et al.  A Beautiful Movie.

"shaven_sinner","9","0","1","12 March 2002"," Warm and Fuzzy, But Just the Facts Ma'am?
","I have read many of the other reviews, both positive and negative. Despite being '000s of kilometres away in Australia, we receive many first-hand news reports on the Hollywood entertainment industry and, alarmingly, reports on alleged 'dirty tactics,' supposedly designed to ruin particular movies' chances of winning Oscars.<br/><br/>I guess the studios will do what they do, simply because their revenues and budgets are dependent upon a movie's success and recognition from the Academy, in particular, and industry in general. It just seems disappointing that people will stoop to slurring a movie in the hopes that its success in any capacity will be diminished.<br/><br/>We have heard that Russell Crowe's character, Nash, was homosexual, anti-semitic and unfaithful to his wife. I do not know whether these things are true, but I remember that after the release of Schindler's List, there was criticism that Schindler's infidelities and poor treatment of his wife were overlooked by director Spielberg.<br/><br/>No doubt, the same people that are complaining about the leaving-out of facts would also complain about the movie being over-long, if extra time was taken to include the facts.<br/><br/>The director uses the film to tell the story that they want to tell. They are given that perogative by the studios, ovbiously with the consideration of commercial viability being an important factor. To label a film as bad, simply because some facts are left out, is supremely ignorant.<br/><br/>If factual deficiencies make a movie bad, then why are films such as the Godfather so highly-regarded? There is no factual basis behind the Godfather whatsoever. Additionally, its subject matter is repugnant, but the story is told in such a way as to make it palatable to a large audience. How is this different from A Beautiful Mind?<br/><br/>I can not speak for Ron Howard's intentions, but I found ABM included sufficient positives and negatives from Nash's life to provide a balanced view. The man was no saint, but he was battling a disease that I personally had no conception of, until I saw this movie.<br/><br/>There was a guy at school with me who had schitzophrenia. He suffered greatly, in addition to his disease, due to our ignorance of what he was going through. He was teased and ridiculed, much like Nash was, yet he has gone on to become a successful lawyer, after 6 years of study. This film has added to my understanding of others, much more than a mindless alien invasion movie or love story. Only the most cynical would overlook the value that this film has to understanding mental illness.<br/><br/>
The point is that directors have limited time in which to convey their messages. Let's face it, if biographical films were completely true-to-life, they would all be 5 + hours long and very boring. The director must use his/her discretion to balance a feasible story with a consideration of the audience's need to be 'entertained'. The director could include many more facts from the character's life, but if they are not pertinent to the story that the director wishes to tell, then what is the point?<br/><br/>Ron ""with cheese"" Howard, judging by the comments on this board, is renowned for making 'schmaltzy' movies. Well guess what people? If you don't like his movies, stop going to see them. Why see something from a particular director if you know that you don't like his work? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Personally, on the odd occasion, I enjoy leaving a movie theatre feeling like I have learned something and, dare I say, feeling uplifted and happy. You can try it too! See this movie."

It's also too slow and at least a half an hour too long at 2 and a quarter hours.<br/><br/>The formula is solidly there. Ron Howard's film pushes all of the accepted buttons. That particular music.

Sure there's a big significant twist which I won't reveal and Russell Crowe gives a very strong performance, but I can't enjoy these sorts of films too much these days.<br/><br/>Still the film will make big money which means that the industry has again been successful at catering to what most people want to see.

Hmmm.<br/><br/>This left him as being some sort of brilliant economic theorist which sounds like a contradiction in terms to me, but probably makes all the more sense for it.

","""A Beautiful Mind"" may not be the most overrated film of the year (""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is), but it is close - which is not to say it isn't good; it is. But just because Russell Crowe is superb and it is a feel-good cloying tearjerker does not make it great.<br/><br/>You bet it is a tearjerker, and overhyped. The two final syrupy scenes - the presentation of the pens, and the Nobel Prize ceremony - nearly gave me diabetes. The entire movie revolves around two concepts: Modern Psychiatry is brutal and ineffective, and all a disturbed man needs is the love of a good woman. So simplistic and specious.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is a good well-made, though manipulative, film taking us into the psychotic world of the famous mathematician. It is loosely based on his life, but conveniently ignores such as his delving into homosexuality which got him arrested and fired from his job. In Left-wing Hollywood I'm surprised they didn't push this abnormality. The performances, especially by Crowe, are first-rate; I being especially impressed by Christopher Plummer.<br/><br/>
No way on this planet is ""A Beautiful Mind"" in the same league as ""Lord of the Rings"" - which IS truly great. If the former wins the Academy Award it will be due only to internal Hollywood politics, which is why ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat up the great ""Saving Private Ryan""<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"". Good. See it for the performances. But I had no trouble thinking of better movies from this past year."
"MotoMike","Null","0","1","11 March 2002"," ... is to mathematics what ""Amadeus"" was to classical music
","--- SPOILERS--- SPOILERS--- SPOILERS-- A Beautiful Mind is based on the biography of the same title of John Nash (Russell Crowe), the genius mathematician who suffered from schizophrenia. It deals with his student years at Princeton, his formulation of the game-theory work that won him the Nobel Prize, his descent into and unexpected rise out of mental illness, and the effect his illness had on his career and his marriage. <br/><br/>Let me start off by saying I don't care for films where mental illness and psychological problems are considered dramatic devices. As someone who has been in therapy, and whose wife and several members of her family have been practicing therapists, I'm aware how different Hollywood's depiction of psychological problems are from reality. It always seems that the sufferer goes into breakdown mode right at the climax of the film, only to be rescued by the love of a good woman or his best buddy, with the good therapist available on the phone to tell him, at last, the Real Truth (""No! I swear to you, Herb, that Pomeranian is NOT your dead uncle ... you've GOT to believe me for once!!!"") . So I'm pretty cool to the pleasures of such films as, say, Ordinary People, The Prince of Tides, Shine, Awakenings, Girl Interrupted and Rain Man (to name just a few of way too many), and I wouldn't really like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest if I thought that it were just about mental illness.<br/><br/>That having been said, I enjoyed this movie immensely because of several things. First of all, even if you know what the movie is about, the moment of Nash's onset of schizophrenia is almost impossible to spot, even in retrospect. And as you follow the story line, you get almost no clue that some characters and situations are hallucinations. The appearance of Ed Harris. as a government agent recruiting Nash as a codebreaker is totally in keeping with the paranoid aspect of the times, and some of the more garish aspects of Nash's belief system (the ""radium implant"", the ""special building"" on campus that nobody knows about but him, the car chase) are easily chalked up to, perhaps, shoddy filmmaking. I know that I started to think this was a somewhat amateurish film with all the black hats and talk about the Russians, but I still bought into the fantasy. I guess at some point, I should have started to think,""Whoa ....  codes in MAGAZINES? A RADIUM Diode?"" .... but we see the action from his point of view and it's close enough to reality to be chillingly convincing. The point here is to make us understand a little but the depth of the problems he faced in trying to discern reality - and it was great to make the most likable character in the movie (Nash's roommate Charles, played by Paul Bettany) one of the imaginary ones. (Reminded me a lot of a certain movie where guys form a club to fight, but I won't reveal that movie's name because that would be wrong.)<br/><br/>Another fine thing about the movie is the Ron Howard's direction. Although Ron Howard's characters have their feet planted firmly in pulp melodrama, they are always redeemed by the extent to which he cares about them and makes us feel the same way. He makes the characters surrounding Nash well fleshed out and likeable, and gives Alicia Nash (Jennifer Connely) a saintliness combined with humanity that, perhaps, the real Alicia may not have had. He lets Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) be just right in the role: no saint himself, but wanting to try to conquer this affliction, in these pre-Lithium days. We like him, we really like him. <br/><br/>The casting of Christopher Plummer and Ed Harris were both inspired choices. (Let's not quite play ""six degrees of Russell Crowe"" ... ) You remember Christopher Plummer, don't you? - as Mike Wallace in The Insider, he was one of the people bringing grief to the same Russell Crowe in The Insider. And Ed Harris was famously a secret and nasty G-Man in The Firm. So when these guys show up on-screen they have an extra cachet of credibility in the roles that Nash has cast them in (even though Ed Harris isn't real!).<br/><br/>So, I enjoyed the movie, shed a few tears at his speech to the Nobel audience, felt good and lucky that I don't have this problem, but have a bit of bad taste about a couple of things. For one, it doesn't take a lot of research to show how sanitized this has been. And, curiously, the shaping of this story into a Hollywood arc diminishes the power of the story; if, as really happened, Alicia and John did get divorced, if, indeed, there was no scene with all those noble words about ""what's real"" ... then how are we to believe that his work really was significant, and mattered in the long run (which it certainly did). And Russell Crowe did a great job of acting, but I gave up waiting for him to decide on an accent. Speech coach, please? He had a good performance up until he walks into that Australian restaurant to play Flight of the Bumblebee ...<br/><br/>Wait. Wrong movie about mental illness. Sorry.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wish someone would cast Russell ""Grumpy"" Crowe in a comedy and force him to smile. I'm certain that Crowe will score an Oscar for this, and A Beautiful Mind has a good chance of walking off with Best Picture. I'm glad I saw it. But (to reiterate my point above) I have to say I don't want to see Hollywood make any more movies about people with mental illness. Like the way Hollywood deals with religion, the problems of divorced people, prison life, and classical music, there's always something kind of insulting and patronizing about these things being turned into neat dramas for our entertainment."
"Masoo","6","0","1","11 March 2002"," Begging for Oscars
","Russell Crowe seemed to be chasing an Oscar as much as he was chasing anything insightful in the character of John Nash. And it's a crying shame when Jennifer Connolly, one of the most naturally voluptuous actresses in an era where rail-thin breast-enhanced women are the norm, looks so startlingly skinny in this movie. She does a good job, but her character degenerates into awfulness. When we first meet her, she's a bright grad student in mathematics who paints on the side, but once her life with Nash begins, she exists solely as The Wife, leaving us to wonder what ever happened to her math, her painting. Not that the movie cares, of course."

Traveling into the mind of a schizophrenic is confusing and emotionless, at best. The twists and turns of doing so make a very eerie pattern of madness where one can't distinguish between what's real and what's not. Yet, there is real feeling for the character who, despite mental illness, went on to win international recognization. It was very hopeful in the end. I would recommend this film for older teens and adults. Fortunately, there was little sex, violence or vulgar language in this wonderful film. Older teens might feel compassion for this man which, I think, is the jist of this film."

","I am not a Russell Crowe fan, but found his a good performance, along with Jennifer Connelly's and Ed Harris'. But, in spite of this, the film turned out to be a little dreary and too long. Why on earth the current trend is making films as long as possible? Can't we have a good movie whose running time doesn't go beyond two hours?<br/><br/>Being a little sensitive when it comes to the same old political references, I got the willies when the ""Russians-are-out-to-drop-a-bomb-on-us"" quote came first. I thought we'd had enough of that bullshit in the past, but apparently not. To be honest, I didn't know the film's action was set in such a large period of time, starting in the early stages of cold war and ending in the nineties, but anyway that remark made me lose interest real quick. Plus the movie drags on too long. Any good film can be flawed by an excessive running time, like happens to be the case and, despite Crowe's great performance, his character is boring at times. I could not care less for John Nash if he is that dull.<br/><br/>To sum up, the film is not bad but, as for deserving so much hype, I sincerely doubt it.

There we find a fun group of genius' and one smarty pants is even ""more"" genius than the rest, John Nash (Russell-TOFOG- Crowe). Nash is a bit of an oddball and doesn't mince words with frilly superfluous adjectives. In fact he says precisely what ever his mind calculates as fact without editing. Hence he comes off a tad rude and uncaring and he's no hit with the gals, guys, or common types that wander in and out of his life. He's as socially defunct as he is brilliant.<br/><br/>His Princeton nemesis, Hansen (Josh Lucas), is nearly as ""good"" as him, and is headed for the position Nash had favored himself. Unless he can come up with something totally new, and hit the world upside the head with his astute theories. He does it is now known (and utilized) as equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games. There's no layman's terms to that, really, just think games without set rules and you'll be close. With his simple idea, he revolutionized economics,globally, and refutes the long accepted ideas of economic genius Adam Smith. Professional success is his.<br/><br/>Then the government comes to him and asks if he can help them decode some ominous codes they've intercepted. He does. His mind, which is cracker jack fast, is able to crack the code fast as an eggshell cracks- and that's pretty fast- Jack. This attracts a secret agent type, Mr. Parcher (Ed "" I played POLLOCK the artist not Pollack the fish!- Harris) who solicits even more secret assistance from the volatile Mr. Nash.<br/><br/>Nash is given top-secret clearance and put to work, finding secret messages the commies have planted in our magazines.<br/><br/>As his governmental extra curriculum begins so does a new phenomenon for the platonic genius. He meets a smart and beautiful gal named Alicia (Jennifer -classic beauty-Connelly) and as quickly as mercury is drawn up with temperature Nash falls head over quantum physics in love.<br/><br/>Meanwhile his government contact, Mr. Parcher, informs him the soviets may be on to him and there may be repercussions for he and his new bride. When Nash is shot at while meeting with Mr. Parcher the mental pressure, which is tremendous, starts to take effect. Nash is breaking down faster than an equation in a room full of mathematicians!<br/><br/>I don't want to give away the storyThat's all you get. GO SEE THIS!<br/><br/>

Last year's Grinch, and this year he tops that tenfold with this sensation, A Beautiful Mind. Bravo! His direction takes a sterling cast, and a brilliantly clever script and creates a masterpiece. Scenes are elegantly stitched together like an Armani suit draped upon an Oscar bound actor<br/><br/>Beautiful Jennifer Connelly lit up the scenes she shared with her star, and not just held her own, but also stole a bit of Crowe's glow. What a talented actor she is. Jennifer is no new comer though folks! Her stunningly realistic portrayal of a junkie in Requiem For A Dream got her a coveted nomination for the prestigious Spirit Award. She was also in the hit sleeper Pollock.. Speaking of Pollock, its star and director Ed Harris plays his shady government agent Mr. Parcher, with the slither he's so famous for; smooth as a properly crusted Crème Brule.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany ( who basically carried any frame of savable celluloid from that god-awful A Knight's Tale fiasco last summer on his broad lanky shoulders) is wonderful as Nash's best friend, roommate and confidant Charles Herman. I've loved this guy the first time I had the pleasure of seeing him perform. Though we know him here for his continuing comic roles, he's actually Mr. Shakespeare back in the Queen's land.<br/><br/>
When you see and hear Russell Crowe (see n.male adj.manly v.to drool in the dictionary) as Nash complete with a quirky West Virginia accent, an odd over-bite and a goofydoodle haircut, you'll almost forgets this manly actor sexed up the screen as a macho hard bodied pheromone projecting studmuffin in Gladiator- almost. Those familiar with Crowe's works know he loves a role that gives him a challenge. It seems to be a kind of Rugby match 'tween the screen with him. Whether he's adding pounds and years to fight evil cigarette companies (The Insider) or leading clueless neo-Nazis to battle against erroneous enemies (Romper Stomper), he devours a role and spits out perfection. He's more than a beautiful body, he's a brilliant mind. I've told Santa I'm not a greedy little girl all I want for Christmas this year is a little Crowe. A 195 pound one named Russell! Gosh is this man gorgeous! I'd like to dip his entire naked being in strawberry whip cream and well, er, umsorry.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is by far the best thing I've seen in a year. The Shipping News, with mega-talented cuteyufalagus Kevin Spacey opens in a couple weeks as well as Ali with chocolate sensation Wil Smith, and of course Mr. Ego (Tom Cruise) opens with Vanilla Sky, but for now, the Best Actor Oscar at the 74th annual Academy Awards may as well be cast with Crowe's name in it - it's his!<br/><br/>Snack Recommendation: Slow roasted Kiwi Crowe dipped in Strawberry flavored whip cream ..."

","The strongest trump card of the Beautiful Mind is its storyline. So much more could have been achieved by so much less, if only the story had been allowed to unfold without the need to mislead or dazzle the audience with special effects and directorial coups. An enjoyable, if schizophrenic film (excuse the pun).<br/><br/>This is the classic nevertheless compelling sociopathic-genius-turned-schizophrenic story. The magnitude of the Nobel prize and thus the deduced importance of the genius's work serves to augment and hold the audience. We all secretly admire and even envy the truly dedicated and gifted people, so our attention is guaranteed from the start.<br/><br/>This attention is wasted firstly by a script that at times focuses on non-story-serving scenes (several Princeton-based ones spring to mind, as well as the GO circular scene, what a pretense..) that dilutes the pace of the film and needlessly prolongs its length, presumably to adhere to the latest ""more is better"" Hollywood fad.<br/><br/>Mr Howard overstates. There is a distinct desire to dress up the story with effects, to tease or mislead the audience with a view to thrill, to fit in every trick of the trade. Understandably, since having an Academy Award story potential, one goes for the big ""8 Oscar"" prize.<br/><br/>The net result is, unfortunately, a dilution of the story, and the attention of the audience on things that don't really matter.<br/><br/>Mr Crowe is acceptable but not consistent. He is struggling, perhaps by directorial misinformation, to balance the character between idiocy and sociopathy, brilliance and simplicity. Even considering the evolution of the character, the inconsistency is apparent, especially when frantic head or hand gestures are used to denote stress and reality shocks. Definitely not an Oscar performance.<br/><br/>Mr Harris is poignant and ghostly and in general positive, although a bit too cowboyish at times.<br/><br/>Ms Connelly brings grace and beauty, but her character is not well defined to the point that it almost becomes a support role.<br/><br/>Good if sparse humour, tasteful cinematography and a soundtrack that serves but does not dominate are some of the positive points of the film.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind is a thriller, a biography, a venture into the unknown depths of the mind, a sociological study, everything and nothing at all. Perhaps that's what schizophrenia is all about..."

Now start with the clichés: The perfect award winning role for best actor is a mentally challenged person with a remarkable ability (Forrest Gump, Rain Man, Shine, etc.) add a martyr wife who supports the main character's eccentric view of the world (Pollock), make it look like a period thing, have some decent cinematography a proven director, then, start preparing your<br/><br/>speech for Oscar night. That's it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind is boring, or silly. It's in fact a competent film that delivers. Problem is, it's not the best film of the 2001.

","This really is a great film, a supremely intelligent and well-made picture that deserves to make a mint and possibly scoop the top Oscars.<br/><br/>I didn't think that Ron Howard was capable of a mature and clever film like this one as much of his work to date has been pretty light-eg The Grinch, Parenthood, EdTV etc. He had a go at 'serious' cinema with Apollo 13 in 1995, but I felt that the popularity of Tom Hanks and the naturally dramatic nature of the Apollo story carried it to its box office and critical heights.<br/><br/>That said, A Beautiful Mind is full-on clever and mannered film-making. Howard is totally on top of his game. His craftmanship and care subtly drives every scene. The film is not cluttered or over-complex, nor is it preachy or patronising while tackling its quite difficult subjects-schizophrenia, the nature of misunderstood genius, the Cold War etc. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe is a God in this film, its his best work to date. He doesn't overdo John Nash's mannerisms or accent, he BECOMES Nash, dominating the movie with an endearing mix of honesty, comic understatement and heartwarming naievety.

","It was sure a happy day when I decided to see Director Ron Howard's new film `A Beautiful Mind'. This film is one that sure looks good to be one of the best of the year. The film stars Russell Crowe, and it is based on the real life story of John Nash. Nash is an ingenious mathematician who has had to battle with schizophrenia. Crowe's performance should equal another Best Actor Oscar nomination. His work was so good that I would not be surprised if he adds another oscar to his acting awards collection.  If you multiply Crowe's work by the very effective supporting performances by Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer it will not be odd to say that this is the best ensemble acting in film this year; even though I am also divided by the fine ensemble acting of `Memento', `Mulholland Drive' and `Sidewalks of New York'.  Director Ron Howard should also receive a Best Director Oscar nomination, and any academy members who disagrees with his nomination should be subtracted from the board.

"lost12many","Null","0","1","5 March 2002"," Intelligence...Good or Bad?
","Intelligence, what can it do for you?  Well there are a couple possibilities.  It can either help elevate you to the next level, or it can bring you down.  Both of these solutions are brought to the forefront in Ron Howard's `A Beautiful Mind.'   The movie explores John Nash (Russell Crowe) who is very intelligent and his plight to be original.  So just what happens when a mathematician can't solve what life throws at him? `A Beautiful Mind' is a wonderful exploration of what it means to be great to some and crazy to the rest.  As the film begins you see a man who is totally engulfed in what he is doing.  He is also a man that has to have a theorem to make sense of anything that he encounters.  This, like many other mathematicians, would be his downfall.  Upon entering Princeton, he strives to find the one thing that no one else has discovered.  His only problem is where to find it.  Nash would look everywhere for that one thing to bring him to the head of the class.  Discovery would finally show its face as a blonde beauty in the local pub. John Nash makes headlines with his discovery and even gets the acknowledgement that he has so desperately desired by becoming a professor. While teaching he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), a young woman who is actually a student in his class.  After going out with her a few times Nash marries Alicia and begins living a very happy life.  As he is just beginning to rise to the top, he hits rock bottom. John Nash is diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic.  He is now allowing that great mind of his to control his life.  There are three characters that become prevalent at this time: Parcher (Ed Harris), Charles (Paul Bettany) and Marcee (Vivien Cardone.)  These imaginary people in Nash's life are what both push him to the edge and inevitably bring him back.<br/><br/>Parcher is a man who supposedly works for the government and needs Nash's mind to break codes and read cryptographic messages.  Parcher is the one person, albeit in Nash's mind, that pushes John to be more than just human. He is the literal representation of Nash's ego. Charles first appears as John's roommate in college.  Charles exists to push Nash to work harder on solving his equation.  He is the one that tells him it is okay to be like he appears.  This is Nash's way of rationalizing his actions.  Finally there is Marcee. Marcee exists to show the child within him.  She shows the innocence along with the consequences of his actions if he continues to recklessly pursue his dreams.  It is through these three characters that we are able to understand John Nash. `A Beautiful Mind' is a great story of the life of John Nash.  It takes us on an emotional journey through the highs and lows of one of the greatest mathematicians.  We are able to see what pushing ourselves to the limits and beyond can do.  You can end up further behind than where you began.  A story, part about being the best that you can be, and part about knowing your limits.  It is through Nash's struggle with greatness and mental illness that we ultimately see true human nature. So what does happen to a mathematician who can't solve what life throws at him? He becomes great in his own mind.  Then somewhere along the way he becomes great in the minds of others.  Not because of what he accomplished, but how he accomplished it. It however is through this journey that he is truly able to understand what it means to be great.  I introduce to you Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash Jr."

","You can almost here the voice-over in your head going ""Nominated for 8 Academy Awards"". You're expecting something pretty good, especially when the nominations cover areas like Best Director, Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. You're a bit wary because it smells a bit of ""Oscar bait"" but you go in still, with hopes up. And find yourself, in the end, disappointed.<br/><br/>Why is this movie #91 in IMDB? On what grounds has it merited it? First of all the plot. Welcome to math club. It's ""based"" on true events. Well thank you Hollywood for sifting through a man's life and plucking out only those bits you thought I'd be able to stomach. Once again we're having a nice old re-write of history in order to try and boost up cinema audience numbers. S o we're being presented with a pared down version of John Nash, a famous mathematician. What did he do? Well Ron Howard's movie doesn't bother telling us (we're probably too dumb) besides a weak mention towards the end. Instead we're focusing on the man himself and his battle with a mental illness (oh my ""Rain Man"" flash-backs). Nash, with his brilliant mind, is approached by the government to help them out. And then things go bad for him. Yes we're presented with a ""twist"" in the story but, unlike some other twist stories such as ""Fight Club"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", I was left feeling distinctly underwhelmed. We pop up and down at various moments in Nash's life, seeing how he is currently coping and yet I was left unengaged by the man's fight for health - it's typically wellish-done fluff that has been before. Make a sympathetic character-overcoming-troubles and naturally you can woo audiences over (can you say ""Forrest Gump""? Can you say ""Rain Man""?).<br/><br/>So is the acting of note? Crowe is competent but his performance here reeked a bit of ham. It's convincing enough but it seems to consist a lot of casting his eyes down, waving his hand about and muttering/talking in a shifting accent. It's easy to play an eccentric it seems. Connolly shows more potential here as the ""long suffering wife"" but her character is given little to do but wander around after Nash. We never get to see what *she* feels besides the complementary tears. She performed better in ""Requiem for a Dream"". Considering who they're up against in their respective categories I feel neither merit their awards based on this movie.<br/><br/>Howard's direction is fine. Everything looks nice, and pretty. There's the use of darkness and shadows to complement moods, scenes, etc. The score, by James I-Can't-Forgive-You-For-Titanic Horner, is used to now and then bash us around into realising we're viewing an emotional moment. Yeah, I got it. Certain touches - such as numbers hovering in the air, etc. - are good enough in showing Nash's mind but the direction gives none of the intensity shown in a movie such as ""Pi"".<br/><br/>Looking at it's awards I would certainly not give this fluff Best Picture or either of the Best Oscars. Best Adapted Screenplay? Not a chance next to ""Shrek"" and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". In fact it doesn't strike me as deserving of any of it's nominations. It's not to say this is a bad movie - I was never bored. But I was never draw in and am dumbfounded as to how this average feel-good-triumph-over- adversity tale is garnering the praise that it has.

","A Beautiful Mind is, on its surface, a story of a brilliant mathematician who submits to schizophrenia, but underneath its a fascinating examination of the power of human perception, and the danger of suspicion when it clouds intellect.  It's a powerful film with exceptional lead performances and strong direction and script.<br/><br/>For two hours and fifteen minutes, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly emerse us in the lives of their characters, John and Alicia Nash.  Nash is a brilliant but arrogant and antisocial mathematician, who slowly loses his grip on reality and becomes consumed by paranoia and schizophrenia, and Alicia is his pupil-turned-wife-turned-caretaker when he becomes dangerously unstable.  Crowe's performances is phenomenal, on par with the best of his work, and certainly superior to the role that won him an Oscar, and Connelly, brilliant last year in Requiem For A Dream, constantly finds ways to support and compliment him.<br/><br/>The film's Oscar nominations and box office revenue speak to its success, but likely Crowe and Connelly will receive the lion's share of the credit. One shouldn't overlook the work by director Ron Howard.  He takes a potentially dreary story, filled with insanity and lots (and I mean lots) of mathematical equations, and constantly finds new ways to portray them visually.  A standout; Nash rides around in circles on his bicycle, muttering to himself, as the camera rises to bird's eye level, revealing his pattern as the shot fades to a window with the same pattern written on it; the symbol of infinity.<br/><br/>The best movies present us with new ideas, questions to ask ourselves reflect on.  I wasn't just engrossed in the situations of A Beautiful Mind, I was constantly absorbed by the questions it posed about reality and obsession.  Nash tells his students at one point that a problem he has presented them with might take them months to solve.  Or, even worse, he adds with a wry smile, the rest of their human existence.  Don't expect the answers to the questions in this movie to come even that quickly."

I didn't know a lot about the figure of ""John Nash"", but that wasn't very bad. That man is very great genious but he suffers from sichzophrenia. And that makes his life too a hell. The subject of psychological illnesses were good, but I think it is not correct that Alicia (the wife of Nash) didn't bring him to a psychological centrum. First she did it, but when he had to return because his illness became worse she followed Nash and that was totaly wrong. This film can give a wrong interpretation of a psychological centrum and it will influence people that such a centrum is a hard place to be and that it is better that you don't go to such a place. But this is totally wrong!!!!! It isn't a bad place... it aren't terrible places. They help you there! The scenes of John Nash, who is trilling of electrian shocks is totally misplaced! For the rest is this movie very good, only the typical Hollywood scenes. Especially the handkerchief scene is a little bit too much of it.<br/><br/>The movie gives a wonderful image of the life of John Nash!<br/><br/>The actors:<br/><br/>1. Russell Crowe: JOHN NASH : he gives the performance of a real sichzofreen. I guess that they have such a life. He is nominated for the Oscars and he may win, but Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge) may win for me, but he isn't nominated. So I can agree that Russell will win.<br/><br/>2. Jennifer Connely: ALICIA NASH : she isn't much on screen this time, but when she is there you can't give any bad comments on her.<br/><br/>3. Ed Harris: WILLIAM PARCHER: he is a real actor and this was the perfect role for him.<br/><br/>4. Christhopher Plummer: DR. ROSEN: an old legend, he is always nice to see in such films, I hope he will continue to make such films and not such films as 'Dragenhunt' or something like that.<br/><br/>5. Paul Bettany: certainly one of the best actors of this year with 'A Knight's Tale' and the upcomming movie 'Dogville' from L. Von Trier.

","Mental illness often makes compelling cinema - think of `Rain Man' or `Shine'. Now both sides of the Atlantic have produced new movies on this theme, looking at the effect of such illness on brilliant and famous individuals: from the UK there is `Iris' portraying Alzheimer's Disease and from the US comes `A Beautiful Mind' examining paranoid schizophrenia.<br/><br/>This latter work is essentially the story of American mathematical genius John Forbes Nash Jnr whose biography of the same name was written by Sylvia Nasar. However, I say 'essentially' because director Ron Howard - known for his 'triumph over adversity' movies (`Apollo 13', `Backdraft', `Parenthood') - has given us a somewhat sentimentalised and sanitised version of a complex life. Nowhere in this film will one learn anything of Nash's homosexuality or importuning, one would never guess about his divorce and remarriage, and we are told nothing of his repressed upbringing or his son's own troubles with schizophrenia.<br/><br/>Having said all this, `A Beautiful Mind' is a must-see movie, primarily because of an outstanding performance from Russell Crowe who plays Nash from his arrival at Princeton in 1947 to his award of the Nobel Prize in 1994. Adopting Nash's West Virginian accent, his ornamental style of speech and mannered mode of movement, this is a character a million miles away from the assured confidence of Maximus in `Gladiator' and will deservedly win him many awards.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is excellent as Nash's wonderfully supportive wife Alicia. Like `Iris', there is not much on the principal's work but, again like `Iris', this is ultimately a love story - an account how a partner can be there when the spouse has literally lost his or her mind.  Director Ron Howard skilfully manipulates us, both visually and emotionally but, in a sense, all art is manipulative and, if we fall for the trap, it's because we want to. We want the human spirit to survive and succeed - and here it most assuredly does."

After leaving Princeton, he accepts a couple of assignments which involve code breaking for the government, one of these being provided by the mysterious Parcher (Ed Harris).  As he undertakes this assignment, John is filled with paranoia as his condition of schizophrenia becomes more apparent to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and the audience.<br/><br/>Although 'A Beautiful Mind' doesn't make for light entertainment, there is some humour to be found.  John's lack of social skills is evident in the way he handles women and his frankness in confessing to them that he would like to undertake intercourse as soon as possible as part of his chat up is quite endearing.  John's room mate Charles also provides welcome comic relief in the film's few lighter moments.<br/><br/>One downside of the story telling in the film is the skipping of several years at a time which may leave you wondering what's been missed out in the account of this man's life (the upside is that the passing of time is accompanied by very convincing make-up!).  The end of the film seems a little rushed in the way John seems to make remarkable progress in his recovery and the fact that his wife sticks by him during his prolonged mental illness is a little unconvincing.<br/><br/>A film dealing with mental illness is never going to be comfortable viewing but the fact that the film is based on a true life story does make it fascinating to watch.  What impressed me the most is the first class acting on display: the two leads Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly produce engaging and Oscar-worthy performances which are at times heartbreaking. In fact, Crowe could quite possibly be the new Tom Hanks in his ability to gain yet another Oscar nomination."

I find the plaudits coming the way of Beautiful Mind inexplicable. Jennifer Connolly - what did she do that was so worthy of the praise being heaped on her? Russell Crowe - farcical.

","The acting in this film is superb. Russell Crowe may get his second consecutive Oscar, (although I wouldn't mind it if they gave it to Tom Wilkinson, either). His run of performances in LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator and this is amazing. One of the best actors of our time. God was in a good mood when he made Jennifer Connelly and he included both intelligence and talent in the package. Even better is the directing of Ron Howard, one of those long-time Hollywood craftsman who may finally get his due this year, (he should have gotten it for Apollo 13 but the academy loves actors who direct their own films). What's especially great is that Howard let us see this story from the heros perspective. We figure things out when he does. What seems real to him seem just as real to us.<br/><br/>The one flaw is the depiction of schizophrenia. I surfed the web on this subject when I got home and the malady is far more complex than this movie suggests and the solution is no where near as simple, (really, there is none). Similarly, autism is much more complex than in Rainman and split personality is much more complex than in The Three Faces of Eve, etc. A movie is just not an adequate forum to explore all the aspects of mental illness. But that doesn't mean you can't make a good movie about a character who suffers from one and all three of these are certainly good movies."

","I've just come back from seeing ""A Beautiful Mind"" and I can report that it is truly a remarkable film.  To tell the truth, I can't recall seeing a film that is so overwhelmingly and consistently bland.  You can't hate it.  It tackles a worthy subject, and does an OK job of it.  The acting is OK, nothing outstanding, and Russel Crowe obviously has the Oscar Glint before him as he gets his hair styled in a very unattractive way for it.  The direction is, well, there.  Subtle, I believe is he word.  In the two and a half hours, I only had the urge to check my watch once, so that wasn't too bad.  There were absolutely no surprises, or twists, or memorable scenes, really.  It was just one of those films that you come out of and go ""Well, that was a film.  What's for dinner?""<br/><br/>I am perhaps hampered in my appreciation of this in that I did Mathematics at Uni, and don't think there is anything intrinsically cool in it. I do, however, know that there are other, bizarre people who DO think that Maths is in some way funky (Oh, you did MATHS!  You must be so SMART!). Which probably influenced me a lot because without the ""You must be so SMART"" bit, you end up with the story of a very unattractive man, with a mental problem, which never gets resolved, but moves nicely into the background.<br/><br/>A good policy for the film itself.  Ignore it.  It's won't change your life, or entertain you, or enlighten you.  It's not really worth spending money on it.

","A Beautiful Mind is definitely a beautiful movie. Please note that when I considering seeing the movie, I raised my expectations considerably. I knew how great the cast and crew were but was afraid of being sorely disappointed. Now, as I look back on the movie and some particular scenes all I can say is that there is no excuse for not to buying a ticket and sitting through two and a half hours of one of the most beautifully crafted, acted and directed movies of all time.<br/><br/>A Beautiful Mind tells the story of the 1994 Nobel award winning Mathematician professor John Nash (Russell Crowe) since he arrived at Princeton University until today. Right from the beginning of the movie you understand that Nash is different from everyone else, but only about halfway through the movie do you understand just how different he is.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is absolutely brilliant as Dr. John Nash and is to be put on an altar somewhere for every other actor to idolize. From the first moment you first see him in the movie until the ending credits you understand that he's not Crowe, he's John Nash. Jennifer Connelly is amazing as Alicia, Ed Harris is incredible as Parcher and so are all the other actors (especially Paul Bettany as Charles!).<br/><br/>A word of warning, though, this is one movie that will definitely mess with your emotions and requires some kind of patience.

"argv","Null","0","1","23 December 2001"," Good, but nothing new from Ron Howard
","Ron Howard's latest film, A Beautiful Mind, is also a beautiful movie. In fact, it's so beautiful, that it seems planned and packaged just for the Oscars, and just in time for Christmas. The film stars last year's Oscar-winning actor, Russell Crowe, as the real-life John Forbes Nash, the mathematical genius who, while a graduate at Princeton University in the 1940s, discovered a principle equation that changed economic theory. But his prodigious career was sidetracked by his struggle with schizophrenia, almost destroying his family and himself. The irony of his predicament was that the drugs that kept his psychosis in check also prevented him from thinking coherently. In order for him to think, he couldn't take his medication, which lead to perpetual delusions. He eventually learned to use his own mind's logic to keep his thoughts in check, even though he still suffered from schizophrenia The movie portrays this struggle, and shows how he learned to live with his illness, while going on to win the Nobel Prize and continuing to teach mathematics at Princeton University.<br/><br/>
Howard's treatment of the characters, plot and atmosphere are all done with his usual gifted talent for direction. But here, he employs an interesting story-telling twist: the first half of the film is viewed from Nash's perspective alone, so we're just as confused, surprised and shocked as he is when his psychosis manifests itself, blurring the line between reality and paranoia. Then, the perspective changes to an objective viewpoint, compelling us to feel sympathy as an outside observer. Crowe's portrayal of Nash's gradual deterioration into schizophrenia is believable, and as he devolves both mentally and physically, we are lead through his emotional and psychological struggle. It's Crowe's performance and Howard maturity as a director that will make this film an Oscar contender.<br/><br/>
Yet, despite its wonderfulness, the film also has its problems. Yes, it's a sweet, good-looking film, but you almost feel pulled into the same old Hollywood formula that worked in the 80s and 90s. We're not seeing anything we haven't seen before, especially from Howard. It also seems to be a fad to make dramas about a genius who is forced to deal with psychological problems, while keeping the audience somewhat unsure about what's real and what's not. This trend started with Good Will Hunting and The Sixth Sense and continues directly into this week's Vanilla Sky. In all these strength of the films are the struggles between the two extremes of the protagonist's mind. Not that A Beautiful Mind is another Good Will Hunting or Finding Forester, but their common element is that they pique our fascination and curiosity about a brilliant mind being in a confused state, using the same psycho-dilemma technique.<br/><br/>The ace-in-the-hole with A Beautiful Mind, however, is that it's based on reality, which has a disproportionately stronger emotional effect than it might otherwise have. By contrast, movies like Good Will Hunting have to be several notches better at character development and personal triumph to have the equivalent emotional impact as their reality-based counterparts. As a strict comparison of movies, the characters in Hunting were far deeper, and the drama more compelling than in A Beautiful Mind, but one can't tell an audience that. True, Nash's actual life may have more interesting because of his being real, but it's the director's job to make us feel it without the reality check as a crutch. Remember, the film was inspired by events in Nash's life, and is also based in part on the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, so more of this movie really is more fiction than real. With this much artistic license, we shouldn't be so willing to excuse oversimplified and over-dramatized accounts of events, but we do anyway. That was Howard's trump card.<br/><br/>That said, just because the movie wasn't as strong as it could have been doesn't mean I didn't like it. I did - in fact, I think the film is excellent, and well worth attending with family or friends this holiday season. It's a feel-good film that we deserve at this time, and there's nothing wrong with that."

","A Beautiful Mind' is not, in the end, the greatest film ever made, not by a long shot--but it has two incredible assets: director Ron Howard, and, most especially, actor Russell Crowe. Experiencing first hand the exquisite horror of schizophrenia is Mr. Howard's contribution to his audience; embodying its terror, hand-in-hand with the subject's absolute genius, is Mr. Crowe's. The supporting cast is excellent in their own rights, especially Jennifer Connelly as Nash's uniquely supportive wife, and Paul Bettany as Charles, Nash's roommate and friend from his days at Princeton. To comment further on the actual particulars of the film would risk spoiling the action for those who have not yet seen it, so on that point I cease and desist. It is Hollywood's latest `bad boy' upon whom I now focus attention. The role of John Nash is Crowe's apotheosis as an actor: it is a mesmerizing performance, rich with physicality and expertly executed--in Crowe's hands, Nash is awkward and arrogant and tormented, rendered so both by his illness and by his brilliance. And yet he becomes the unlikely hero for whom we cheer. Make no mistake about it--this is Russell Crowe's triumph, a glowing recorded accomplishment that unfortunately might be the yardstick from which he is measured in the future. I say unfortunately' only because it seems a monumental hurdle to overcome--it is The Role of a Lifetime, for which Mr. Crowe, as evinced in previous films, was most assuredly up to the task."

"Bob_St_Cul","9","0","1","25 February 2002"," Right actor, wrong year?
","I'm sure there are a few members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences who are kicking themselves for giving Russell Crowe the Best Actor Oscar in the wrong year. Crowe won last year for the costume epic Gladiator, although nominee Ed Harris was more deserving for his work in Pollock. This year, Crowe's stellar performance in A Beautiful Mind could be overlooked simply because he won last year. That would be a shame, because Crowe's portrayal of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician who has battled schizophrenia, is one of the top performances in film this year. Crowe covers 47 years of Nash's life, ranging from his grad school days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize. In between, he goes through hell.  In a role far removed from Gladiator, Crowe is utterly convincing as the troubled, socially inept Nash. From the film's beginning to the crisis point in Nash's illness, the tale is told from Nash's perspective-which gives director Ron Howard and scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman the chance to shine. Nash's delusions are apparent from the beginning-if you know where they are. They are interspersed with reality so well that they're bound to, at least partially, surprise the viewer when they are revealed. The result is a fascinating look at an illness whose hallucinations can seem all too real. Jennifer Connelly adds depth to her role as Alicia, Nash's long-suffering wife, who (at least in the movie) perseveres throughout Nash's illness and aids him to a gradual recovery. This film has been criticized for taking liberties with facts surrounding Nash. Some have argued that the film misrepresents schizophrenia and places it at the wrong time in Nash's life. Others have complained that the film fails to note that Nash fathered an illegitimate child, was divorced from Alicia for quite some time, and is allegedly bisexual.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where the results are powerful enough to justify a less-than-factual account. On its own terms, A Beautiful Mind is a moving tale of triumph over adversity, not to mention a classic love story.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

It's an often powerful movie, and the acting is strong, but it's really nothing to put in a top 100 like this site's users have. Maybe if you know nothing at all about the movie you'll like it, but you only need to know that he eventually wins a Nobel Prize to know exactly how it will end, ruining most of the suspense. Still, I enjoyed the scenes with Ed Harris, he's wonderfully creepy as the mysterious agent. I also liked the way the movie showed how the guy saw strange patterns everywhere, that was pretty interesting. Jennifer Connelly is not near as good in this film as the reviews make her out to be. Her performance is not that big a deal. Russell Crowe was mostly convincing but often overly mannered as Nash.

Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful story - but that's just it, ultimately, it's so beautiful it's almost idyllic, it's too sweet, the problem (sic!) is too neatly solved. I had no idea that the real story of Nash's life is far from what I saw in the movie (I read this only after I saw the movie - and it really doesn't matter, a movie is a movie and it should stand judgement by itself), it didn't ring true - because it's too bloody perfect!

","I'm as big a Russell Crowe fan as they come, but this time he has taken the facial tics too far. All one sees on screen is (O-V-E-R)A-C-T-I-N-G rather than a believably portrayed character. One can never get past the fact that it's Russell-Crowe-as-John-Nash rather than just John Nash. This does not matter so much in other (types of) movies, but here it disturbs the whole process of spectator involvement, never allowing you to relax and settle back in your seat in order to watch the drama unfold.<br/><br/>The film does manage to take the spectator into the world of schizophrenia and make it seem ""real"", and the moment of realisation (when Nash is suddenly able to separate reality from delusion) is cleverly done. As a whole, however, the film is belaboured and conventional, crying out for Academy attention with its uplifting love-conquers-all story featuring a mentally disturbed genius as the protagonist. (This practically sounds like the Oscar instruction manual on How To Get Nominated.) The attention was duly given. Never mind that the actual facts of the real John Nash's life were somewhat white-washed in the movie for mass appeal.<br/><br/>Jennifer Connelly is a graceful presence throughout the film, but her character is too good to be true. Only one or two scenes show her as a human being with messy emotions and desperation rather than as that June Allyson cypher, the long-suffering 50s wife. The standout is Paul Bettany as Nash's room-mate - charming, believable and natural, as effortless in his acting as Crowe is obvious."

Uh, it's a beautifully executed thriller that kept me on the edge of excitement through it's roller coaster thrill-ride of emotional thrills that's not overlong or fakey!<br/><br/>Watch for crowd-pleaser Austin Pendleton (Skidoo!) near the end, plus appearances from Roy Thinnes (Code Name: Diamond Head), Rance Howard (Ed Wood), Taxi's Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer (Dracula 2000), and 'Green Eggs and Ham'."

","RATING:  ***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>
On the surface, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a biopic of John Nash, one of America's great mathematicians. But that statement is misleading. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is not a film that paints a big, sweeping portrayal of the events of one man' life. Instead, in the way that Ed Harris did last year with ""Pollock"", Ron Howard gives the viewer a more personal look at the subject of the film. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't take the easy route and merely dramatize everything that Nash accomplished, for that would really only be a two-hour way of saying ""Won Nobel Prize for..."" They let us get to know Nash as only those who were closest to him knew him, and most remarkably show us how his mind processed and who he was.<br/><br/>
John Nash (Russell Crowe) is a math student studying at Princeton College. His friends are studying and building on the works of what he considers to be ""lesser mortals"", while what he really wants to do is come up with a truly original idea. He spends his time alone, trying to find definitive patterns to everyday movements, games, etc. He gets encouragement from his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), but I'll jump the gun a little and tell you this is where the trouble starts. Suddenly, he does find his original idea, and it is so revolutionary that he is given a grant to study/teach at MIT. There, he meets Alicia, a student of his that he has begun to court. The two get married a while later, but during this time, Alicia doesn't see that Nash is being plagued by delusions, one a CIA operative (Parcher, played by Ed Harris) who enlists him on a ""top secret mission"" to try and discover secret encoded messages in periodicals supposedly being sent out by Russian spies. His empty quest starts to devour him, as he dreams of the Russians coming after him and other secret forces closing in. Alicia begins to notice that something is definitely wrong, and starts to help her husband try and realize what is real and what isn't. <br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" is a solid, powerful drama. I'll re-iterate that it doesn't tell us everything about John Nash, and sometimes that irked me. I admit I did not know much about John Nash's accomplishments, and going out, I wasn't in the least bit enlightened on that front. His supposedly breakthrough work on game theory goes relatively unexplained here, and that was one thing in the film that could have used a little tweaking. However, this is about the man, not the work. Many people have complained about the film's ignorance towards Nash's bisexuality, and I would have to disagree with them to an extent. There are moments in where bisexuality is most definitely hinted at. This would be more of a problem if the film was not so obviously trying to focus on Nash's paranoid schizophrenia, something that is portrayed magnificently. <br/><br/>Akiva Goldsman has fashioned his screenplay in such a way that we are put in Nash's shoes, and then brought to see a more objective view. At first, we have little idea as to what Nash's delusions are, they all blend into reality seamlessly. Then, they start to get more outrageous, and when Nash's fears of these images start to be brought out into the public, we start to look at him from another viewpoint. However, we feel for him, because we have seen what he is going through, and we feel for those affected by him (especially Alicia) because he has become so out of touch with the world.<br/><br/>
This film is a prime example of what Russell Crowe can do when he's not out toga partying with Ridley Scott. He gives one of his best performances, portraying the schizophrenia without over-doing it or milking moments for their dramatic value. Another actor might immediately approach the subject grimly and teary-eyed, but Nash at first cannot realize what he is seeing does not exist, so why should he be afraid? Jennifer Connelly gives the other extraordinary performance in the film. Connelly has been one of the most under-appreciated and hardest working actresses in the business, and it is wonderful that she will now get the recognition she deserves for her powerful, passionate portrayal of Alicia Nash. <br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" is compelling film that never stoops to endorse melodrama or over-acting. It doesn't get all the details of John Nash's life in, that much is true, but it doesn't need to. It has a purpose, and it executes it in magnificent form. It is a fine, intricately constructed vision of paranoid schizophrenia and a man who had the will to defeat it. And although skeptics will attack it until the cows come home, the truth is that ""Mind"" is beautiful."

"nowonmai42","Null","0","1","23 February 2002"," Not so beautiful
","Somewhere buried beneath all the treacly dialogue, emotional cues, and hero shots in `A Beautiful Mind' is a good film struggling to get out. To its credit, the film doesn't preach about the inherent nobility of its schizophrenic protagonist as much as it could, although it still tries to convince us that everything, even debilitating mental illness, will work out okay, as long as we believe in the Power Of Love. Robin Williams has destroyed his career with this stuff - indeed, director Ron Howard seems determined to snatch from Steven Spielberg the tainted mantle of this country's most broadly popular, and tragically wasted, filmmaking talent. Darren Aronofsky covered this same territory in `Pi' a few years ago, but stripped away the sentiment and soft-focus to emerge with a much edgier and more interesting film.      Russell Crowe is John Nash, a mathmetician-savant with some odd behavioral tics. Nash doesn't much like people, because people don't tend to warm to his erratic behavior and mumbled insults as much as they do to, say, puppies. We meet Nash as a Princeton grad student, where he is the butt of his classmates' jokes, and is in danger of flunking out for failing ever to attend class, nor even to propose a topic for his dissertation. However, as the movies have taught us, a serendipitous breakthrough is always around the corner. A gorgeous blond in a bar presents Nash with a moment of clarity, and his subsequent critique of the prevalent mathematical paradigms of the day earns him a prestigious career at MIT, and eventually catches the eye of the Pentagon. He begins to work covertly as a codebreaker for the feds, but becomes increasingly worried as the depth of his commitment is made clear. Will his shadowy government contact really keep him safe from the Russians, as promised? What will his wife think when she find out? Do his colleagues know the extent of his involvement with the government?<br/><br/>     As expected, none of this is what it seems. Nash is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and the boundaries between fantasy and reality suddenly come into question. `A Beautiful Mind' skillfully delivers a first-person experience of the terror and bewilderment that is schizophrenia, and has fun with Nash's own sense of humor about his illness. Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance that far surpasses his Oscar-winning turn in Gladiator (which isn't saying much), but the part has the stink of one that was written with Oscar in mind for whatever leading man of the moment was lucky enough to win it. By the time Nash's condition has been made clear, director Ron Howard is already firmly in hero-worship mode. The ennobling music and absolute poignancy with which Howard presents his story seem to dare us to exhibit anything other than utter idolatry for his subject. As Nash's wife Alicia, Jennifer Connelly is forced to utter platitudes like `I can see glimpses of the man I married, and that's enough' without rolling her eyes or vomiting stomach acid. The absurdity culminates with Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize, which he dedicates to Alicia for standing by him all these years, and helping him complete the journey that got him there. Indeed, a beautiful woman by my side, and even a touch of paranoid schizophrenia, would have made my own journey to the end of `A Beautiful Mind' considerably less painful."
"Dick Murchy","9","0","1","21 February 2002"," A Near Perfect Effort
","Ron Howard seems to be back in form with this nice movie. I even enjoyed Mr. Crowe whom I feel is an over rated actor. What has been troubling Mr. Howard's most recent movies is his temptation to paste them as American Pie slices of a generic visual experience. I didn't believe for a minute the cliche acting and directing in his Apollo 13 movie. But, here he seems to be back in true form more in touch with his early films like Parenthood and The Paper. If not for the sappy ending, this would be a perfect film. It is not the film that Lord of the Rings is or even The Man Who Wasn't There, but it will probably win best picture and Howard just may take in his first directing award. Too bad, because even though this is an excellant film, the awards should go to the best. Still, by all means everyone should see this film if not just for Mr. Crowe's performance and the story (a true one) in itself."

She should get the oscar for a leading role!).<br/><br/>However I think they shouldn't have used the name of John Nash in the movie. The story that is told in the movie is extremely different from the biography of Nash (communism instead of aliens, son from another woman, divorce, etc...)!

"ruby_fff","8","0","2","20 February 2002"," An entertaining film of substance and delight. Not at all morbid in spite of the 13-letter 's' word. There's dashes of humor, bemusement a-plenty.
","To tell a story about a schizophrenic person is a challenge in itself. Yet director Ron Howard delivered a literally entertaining suspenseful film with equal sensitivity, revolving around the backbone storyline of the love relationship between two persons - John and Alicia Nash, fascinatingly portrayed by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly. It's a heart-warming film, ultimately uplifting. It affirms that with tenacity and persistence, loving and steadfast supportive companionship, hope - life's staple, will thrive and grow. Do not just give up and be overcome by other's opinions of you.<br/><br/>
It is a beautiful mind. Such fascination with the world he sees, envisions. It captivates, enchants, delights and bewitches. Confuses, too. Is it for real? Is it only fictional in his mind? Nevertheless, it's a beautiful mind. Period. Infinity. It's a MÃ¶bius strip. Reminds me of the world of M.C. Escher - it's science and fiction, mathematical and sensational. The nurturing of such a beautiful mind, as director Howard points out, is the robust element of love, tender & care. <br/><br/>To go to a movie with expectations of accuracy and truth in its delivery does set oneself up for disappointment. A movie is a movie is a movie. It is not a factual documentary, an A&E Biography, or E! channel's Scandal for that matter. Drama, in every sense of the word, is not real. It mimics a situation, its emotional characteristics, and actors give performances for our viewing pleasure. We are fortunate to have passionate filmmakers who produce films of substance. It's best to take the film for what its worth and enjoy the creative talents of the collaborative effort. Filmmakers may try to be as close to facts as possible, but they all have disclaimers at the end of credit roll for any fictitious injections in the film. So why stop yourself from appreciating the film with nagging doubts of accuracy and truth. Like the ever changing/generating molecules, truth is but for the moment it existed. <br/><br/>The excellent performances by the two leads, Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, truly deserve the Golden Globe Awards, along with Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay, and longtime producing partners of Imagine Entertainment, Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. ""A Beautiful Mind"" is further graced by fine supporting performances: Ed Harris - never disappoints, be it light in ""Milk Money,"" heavy in ""Third Miracle,"" all-encompassing in ""Truman Show,"" passionate in ""Pollock,"" intense in ""Enemy At the Gates"" or vulnerable in ""China Moon."" Christopher Plummer - a stroke of genius casting him as we can't tell for sure if he's playing the nemesis again as he often does. Paul Bettany - the brilliant Geoffrey Chaucer of ""A Knight's Tale"" who can be tongue-whipping and subtle. Universal Pictures and Dreamworks certainly luck out in joining this endeavor by being distributors of the film, U.S. and worldwide. The eight Oscar nominations included film score by the inimitable James Horner, film editing, makeup (indeed!) besides best picture, director, actor, supporting actress, and screenplay. Cinematography was by master Roger Deakins, whose superior photography quietly complemented the varying moods as the story unfolds. Deakins was behind the two recent Coen Brothers films ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" 2000 - deftly subtle & dim lighted color, and ""Man Who Wasn't There, The"" 2001 - indisputably exquisite & artistic black and white. <br/><br/>Give yourself a chance to see ""A Beautiful Mind."" Clear your mind and go see it without expectations. Simply enjoy. Yes, believe that ""something extraordinary can happen"" in your life."

","Not being a professional reviewer or critic,I make my judgment regarding a given film from the gut & heart up.  That said this movie was a standout. It was unique in that the suspense was in wondering when Nash would start showing symptoms of schizophrenia.  Of course, when the symptoms were revealed, one shared disbelief with Nash.  After seeing it early yesterday evening, I could not get my mind off the film.  I kept pondering in my own mind how it must be to be a genius who can conjure phenomenal circumstances outside reality.  I am still boggled.  For Nash, it must of been some kind of trip."

","Nobody else need be nominated; Russell's gonna take home the gold - as is Globe & Oscar - again this year.  I was awestruck by his performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"".  I also believe this will be the film that gets Ron Howard at least an Oscar nomination (having been cheated out of ""Apollo 13"").  The writing, all the supporting actors, the photography - everything was wonderful about this movie, which spans 47 years in the life of Nobel laureate John Nash.  It's at times frightening and pathetic, but you end up cheering for Nash in the end.  After seeing the movie, viewers will feel inclined to go back and rehash various scenes and say ""That's why that happened"" or ""I get it now!"" - something like ""The Sixth Sense"" made us do. This movie is well worth the money and the momentary yawn that might slip out during the mathmatical talk.  It was a delight from start to finish and shows that Russell Crowe is truly an outstanding actor - even without showing us his thighs & biceps!"

","I did enjoy this movie but do not think it should win Best Picture.  It was a typical Ron Howard film (feel good, no cursing, Americana).  I typically enjoy his films.  In comparison to the ""bio"" of John Nash, written by Nash himself, this film is only very remotely about Nash and more about Schizophrenia.  I think adding about 1/2 hour more to the film and showing more of what really happened in Nash's life would have made it better. Read the ""bio"" of Nash to see what I mean. I thought ""Memento"" was a much better picture and much more difficult for the director to make. I didn't really find the acting to be any better than many other films I saw this year, either.  Sure it was good, and maybe it was the best out of what was nominated. Basically, I feel that the film should not have been about a real character (Nash) if it was not going to be an accurate depiction of his life, outside of his mental problems.  I realize that may not have been the point of the film. In which case, it should have been about a fictional person.  The direction was good and the story came together well I admit. But should it win Best Picture than it will be one of the least dynamic Best Pictures on the list."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Masterful moviemaking can look so easy as a finished product.  Ron Howard seems to be peaking as a movie maker. Still though, he continues to get caught up in melodrama, but much less so in this fine film.  Mumbling Russell Crowe is outstanding (again) as the brilliant, but haunted Dr. John Nash.  Jennifer Connelly stands toe-to-toe with Crowe in every scene.  If you are unfamiliar with Connelly's work, check out ""The Hot Spot"".  It's a sleeper with Don Johnson and Virginia Madsen.  WOW!  As usual, Ron Howard has produced a few interesting notes. He has regular appearance of family members, including veteran actor dad, Rance.  Also, note the brief appearance of super-casting director (more than 100 films) of Jane Jenkins.  Regular film-goers will easily recognize her name.  This movie is not your typical bio pic.  This movie is about mental illness and both Nash's brave attempt to fight the disease with as little medication as possible.  This film makes a statement that disease is often too quickly treated with pills and not compassion, support and grit. Wonderful supporting roles by Christopher Plummer and the under-utilized Judd Hirsch make this a truly masterful picture.

I didn't feel that the schizophrenia was presented with enough background. Usually, hallucinations grow out of something in the person's life, but we don't learn anything about Nash's life. He is just dropped into Princeton without any history (or family), so it's a bit hard to care deeply about his descent into madness. The love story was also a bit thin; it was not clear what made Nash endearing that someone would sacrifice so much for him. Then there's the problem with mathematics. All of it is presented as extremely important to geniuses, but it can't be explained to us, so all we get is a lot of blackboards and windows coated with symbols we must assume mean something. At least with psychotic pianists, we can understand why the music is important and the love of their life. But math? Once the story turns into an after-school special about sticking by crazy people because they are gifted and deserve our love, I felt that the movie had become an excellent made-for-TV product, but an Oscar film?

","As a graduate film student, I watch hundreds of movies a year.  By now, I can tell a good film from a bad one.  A Beautiful Mind, as with most of Ron Howard's movies, is somewhere in between.  It has some satisfying moments, but just doesn't make it all the way to home base.  It's definitely an admirable effort and I did enjoy the film, but I thought it was lacking in dialogue, plot, visual appeal, and imagination. After watching A Beautiful Mind steal the Golden Globe, and quite possibly the Oscar, for Best Film from The Lord of the Rings, I have a new disliking for this mediocre film.  Anyone who has seen The Insider, also starring Russell Crowe in a drama about a real-life person, should know that it is a far more superior film in every aspect.  Go out and rent it now and you'll see that Michael Mann knows what he is doing.  And no recent film has better dialogue than The Insider. Getting back to ABM, the performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are pleasing, but Russell's character just seems to be an overly quirky and confused version of his character in The Insider.  And will somebody tell me how Jennifer Connelly has managed to look the same for the past 10 years!  Now that's impressive. I keep hearing critics comment on how ABM does such a wonderful job in getting the audience inside the mind of a genius and schizophrenic.  How do they do it?  Special effects.  I was not impressed by this, with the exception of the code-breaking scene.  And the entire movie is about a character that I don't really like.  What caused his schizophrenia?  In the movie, it is apparently John F. Nash's inflated ego.  He refuses to go to classes with ""mere mortals"" losing their ability to be creative.  He drives himself crazy because he wants to be more important than he really is.  And no one even mentioned his bisexuality and divorce from his wife... Well, if you loved this movie, that's great.  It's a relatively good film, much better than some of the trash that comes out these days.  And I don't believe in criticizing films.  Film, to me, is a wonderful and powerful art medium.  I fully realize how difficult it is to make a good film and how there are an overwhelmingly large number of challenges and obstacles to juggle with when doing so.  The only reason I'm writing this is because of the surprisingly high-regard people have for this movie.  It's not that great, and it better not win the Oscar even though that haunting prospect seems very likely.  I should also add that I have a lot of respect for John F. Nash, Jr. and all of his accomplishments.  It's just that this film doesn't accomplish as much."

Later in the film, when he stops taking his meds and these people reappear, it's completely easy to see how Nash must have felt relieved in some way.  ""I was so afraid you weren't real,"" he says, even though we as the audience know that they weren't.  This might all sound confusing if you haven't seen the film, but all I can say is prepare yourself.  It will touch and educate you deeply, espcecially if you know anyone battling mental illness."
"lisarull","9","0","1","14 February 2002"," Stunning performances that avoid the worst kind of schmaltz
","Yes this is high Oscar-fodder: it's the kind of material that makes the awards judges go weak (and look, nominations galore and wins for all concerned... except of course, in the final analysis one fears, for Ron Howard - like Michael Mann, the system rarely forgives popular TV origins).<br/><br/>And let me say first off that it would be foolish to deny that a goodly portion of the audience for this are going because they long to see something to erase the critical disaster that was ""Proof of Life"" from their memories (because, facing facts, this would make a great movie anyway, but Russell Crowe is what will have drawn most of its audience).  And, thank god, it succeeds in that.  In POL we had that body in a black vest struggling to act in an incredibly formulaic action drama.  Here, RC is back to what he does best - ACTING - and we get a white t-shirt... well, I'll definitely settle for that.<br/><br/>I dreaded that this would be a real schmaltz-fest: don't get me wrong, I liked ""Apollo 13"" and I'll cry at almost anything, but I was rather wary of how much ABM would be wringing my tear-ducts.  In the end it's an incredibly tempered depiction of mental illness and what directoral/camera trickery is done is subtle and nuanced - in keeping with the performances.  Knowing as much as I do about mental health issues and the experiences attached to them, I felt moved - but not in an obvious way - by the way this was dealt with.  Jennifer Connelly (as Alicia) does a magnificent job in portraying the quiet, and then raging, frustration and love felt by a partner in such circumstances.<br/><br/>It seems unfair to pick out individuals from the cast for comment - above and beyond Crowe's touching performance which truly inhabits the character of John Nash - since each makes such a great contribution to the overall storyline.  However, Harris and Bettany especially could have found themselves caught in the worst kind of roles, yet they lend the film immense solidity and depth. <br/><br/>Given the storyline there is not much that is radical or previously unseen, but what is done is done very well and avoids the worst excesses associated with this kind of film.  And it is not exactly about 'overcoming' schizophrenia (which implies 'cure') but rather 'dealing with' it.<br/><br/>Ultimately though it was a pleasure to see such a return to form for an actor who deserved better than dross like ""Mystery, Alaska"" and ""Proof of Life"" (note these both followed great critical/popular acclaim pieces like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Gladiator"") as ludicrously entertaining as these may have been in their own right if Crowe had not demonstrated such immense talent elsewhere."

","Russell Crowe is amazing in this role as John Nash, a super geek. The sense of humanity and impending tragedy is gripping. You really feel for the mathematician as his problems worsen. That Nash is able to eke out so much triumph from his troubled life is a tremendous affirmation of the human spirit. It's based on a true story, but rather large liberties were taken with the story as it is told in the book. That's not really a bad thing, but somebody involved with the making of this movie did make a bad decision to use a rather common trick these days, used in movies as varied as ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Sliding Doors."" The trick involves presenting the audience with a point of view other than the standard movie narrative. The mistake made in this movie is that the view of Nash's hallucinations is presented so that the audience thinks there's a conspiracy for most of the movie. This probably made the movie more commercial, but it deflected the audience from the real drama in the story."

One is they show a pacifier on the table where the scene should be late 1950's and is a nuk type pacifier which I believe didn't arrive until the 1970's.

","Do not listen to others who say schizophrenia cannot go into remission, for John Nash, in real life it did just that.  The best movie of the year and one of the top movies of all time. Written beautifully, with acting that is truly outstanding, the movie is unsurpassed in giving viewers an insight into the horrific chasm one faces with this type mental illness. Russell Crowe accurately lives this character. Equalling or topping Dustin Hoffman's performance in ""The Rain Man"". (If you ever see any youthful pictures of Nash he even looks a lot like Crowe)<br/><br/>This is a story of an affable but quirky young mathematician   destined to be one of the top two or three scientific minds of the twentieth century slowly losing reality to schizophrenic delusions. Crowe's portrayal of this character's struggle with the demons, and his emotional relationship with his young wife Alicia, played by Jennifer Connelly, will leave you on the edge of your seat. Director Ron Howard's suspenseful crafting of the torments and delusions plaguing Nash are both masterful and insightful.<br/><br/>

I believed that the way he was cutting and pasting newspapers and magazines showed how confused his mind was.<br/><br/>Last time Brian Grasier produced a movie about someone with a psychiatric disorder was ` As Good as it Gets', a movie that won two Oscars:  one for Jack Nicholson   `Melvin Udal',the obsessive compulsive writer.

I am cheering for all who got nominated, specially Russell Crowe, because he is a very good artist and because I don't believe that the Academy has ever given two Oscars in a roll to a foreign born actor. <br/><br/>I love the fact that `Alicia Nash's' played by Jennifer Connelly (Inventing the Abbotts) stayed by her husband's side until he was finally able to live with himself and society. My neighbors are getting the divorce!  This is a true story in every sense of the word.  `A Beautiful Mind' gave me more compassion than I already had for my neighbor who has the disorder. My neighbor used to send  letters to the entire homeowners association talking about how much Big Brother was giving him a hard time. It is amazing! He complained about the side effects of his medication. He has been hospitalized! It is very interesting that Ron Howard gave us the chance to see the mind of a schizophrenic.

From Charles, the British roommate, to ""Big Brother"", this film WILL put you on the rollercoaster ride of your cinematic life! Ed Harris is an extraordinary actor (see Pollack), Russell Crowe is flawless (Gladiator), and the brunette playing Nash's wife captures the perfect blend of chemistry, shyness, prowess, youthful beauty, and, later in the movie, ever-so-patient spouse, as good as anyone I've ever seen play the part (think Mercedes in The Fisher King). The fact that Ron Howard directed makes it all the more worth seeing. I RARELY cry outside of moments with my wife and newborn son, but at the tail end of this movie even my eyes watered. Four of Four Stars, Ten on a Ten Scale. Drama, some comedy, some violence, very little (if any) swearing (SURPRISE!!!), and some actual intellectual conversation.

"jedsalazar","Null","0","1","11 February 2002"," A Beautiful Film
","I went to a screening of the film, A Beautiful Mind this weekend.  Let me start by saying that I was openly skeptical about seeing this film due to two key things.  First off, this film was directed by none other than Ron Howard, which should put a foul taste in your mouth (for those of you who have seen The Grinch, can relate).  Second, I'm not the biggest fan of Russel Crowe.  I thought his performance in Gladiator, was a bit over rated (as was the movie). The only thing, that got my ass in the seat was Jennifer Connely.  She is one of the most under rated actresses in Hollywood.  Her performance in Requiem For A Dream, was over looked by the Oscars, and the Academy. Let's start by saying that I will not be mentioning this man's real life, which is the target of bad reviews that I have read lately saying that the story line left out some key things of his life, such as adultery, etc.  To me, this isn't what makes a film, so we can skip that for now. This film's opening, gives you no hint, as to what you are to expect.  A student at a promising University, allowed to attend thanks to a special Grant he recieved from the state.  Russel Crow's character seems to hardly fit in with the rest of the mathematicians.  The opening scene is a proffesor speeking to the class about how mathematicians are the real people who win wars, for our country, by cracking codes, that are read by our enemies, giving their ego's a boost, and also throwing some partiotic duty propaganda in your face.  This may, or may not was a good decision, as it almost gave away the whole plot. Russel Crow starts to gain friendship with the bunch, and discovers his wacky room mate, who drinks, and disagrees with his constant studying.  The character watches his classmates succeed by publishing their work, while Crowe, is left behind, working on a formula that many say are impossible to prove.  Dispite what they say, he continues to go deeper into this formula, and never gives up. Crow's performance in this film was actually impressive.  Showing us that he can ditch this whole ""tough guy"" appeal, and enter the mind of a true genius.  The way that he portrayed a man, that could have been looked at as a geek, was an awesome performance.  The plot seems to drag, and go nowhere for the first half an hour, but for those who of you who have finished the film, you would know, that this is needed. The way that Ron Howard visually shows us, how Russel Crowe, cracks these complex codes in his head using CGI, may, or may not have taken away from the film.  I thought it was a little too simplistic, and took away from the raw intelligence, this man was supposed to have. Let's enter Jennifer Connely's performance, as I thought it was the performance that made this film.  She starts out as Crow's student, many years later from his own days of being a student.  He is a careless professor.  Not careless about mathematics, but careless about his students, as he believes mathematics cannot truly be taught.  He opens by giving the class a problem that he claims will take a lifetime to solve. Now, the way that this film's plot merged the characters of Crowe, and Connely, was strange, and at times just plain confusing.  Even going back to the film, I think they made some mistakes with their character interaction. But besides these few flaws, Connely's performance seems to save Crowe, and Howard. The plot seemed to stick to the story fairly well, but it was the last half an hour of this film, that throws everything together, and makes me call this a truly beautiful film.  At times, I had a hard time with what I was watching.  The way that they go into his mind, and show him starting to go crazy, is hard to watch, as they did a good job, of making you feel for this bitter man.  The direction of the film was quite eligant, and was thought threw to avoid a turkey, yet you can still feel that Ron Howard had thrown in his little ""directing methods"" that took away from the raw feeling of terror, which was supposed to strike the viewers numerous times during this film. All in all I say that this is a new genre of film, and the wonderful performances of two gifted actors, and the intrigueing storyline, of this genius' fall from glory, made this a beautiful film.  I felt myself, waiting in anticipation to see the ending, and by the end credits, felt myself, craving to see this film again.  A truly breakthrough film for both Crowe, and Howard, although nothing new for this talented actress known as Jennifer Connley.  Her wonderful performance makes this film, a must see, by any standards.  Ron Howard's ""break through performance"" hype, wasn't under lived at all.  I can see him being a new director now, and producing decent films, in the future as long as he has the talented actors, and actresses, to save him. 9.8 out of 10."

","I am a Mental Health crisis worker, and have never seen a better presentation of Schizophrenia.  It was so well done that I never had any idea that the film was switching from reality to delusion until well into the film.  Kudos to all concerned in this production."
"jack_94706","8","0","1","9 February 2002"," A fine movie; a ""detailed"" book
","Enjoyed reading many other reviewer's comments, especially those who'd experienced schizophrenia themselves or who'd worked as psychiatrists and the like. I've had some acquaintance on a personal level with friends and family who've experienced mental illness -- both bi-polar illness (usually called mania or manic-depressive illness) and schizophrenia. After first seeing the movie and then reading Sylvia Nasar's book, I have very mixed emotions about both. The main ""true"" thing which comes through in either version -- is that schizophrenics do sometimes recover, or experience long periods of ""remission"" as the book describes it. Central to this, many times, is the support of family and recognition of professional colleagues. In Nash's case, many many colleagues were exceptionally tolerant and caring -- something more underscored in the book. The movie makes Nash's wife the main hero, plain and simple, in his recovery. The books paints a much more varied and full-bodied story of life with his wife, his mistress, his sons (one by his wife, one by his mistress) -- and of his homosexual liaisons which were also key to his life-long journey towards becoming nicer or more human and humane. The book contains a wealth of detail -- much of it about Nash's contemporaries rather than about his own life; I'd say you get about one-third Nash, two-thirds Nash's acquaintances and company. It's impossible to write a biography, of course, without giving background details. But Nasar had great difficulty making both Nash's personality and his so-called ""Beautiful Mind"" comprehensible or appealing. A lot of what he did and thought was more ugly than beautiful. A different title would have helped greatly, I think. Anyway, Nasar's way of coping with writing about Nash himself was to take refuge in describing those around him who were less successful but easier to describe, or who were more extreme in personality or who achieved greater acclaim before he did. She wants to show that he, to some extent, ranks with the greatest thinkers of any time -- people like Nicola Tesla, Einstein, Pascal. This may be true, and when she showed how Nash sought to approach the really knotty problems, especially those considered important by many people -- it works. But Nasar is terrible at explaining math in its particulars or in general. She does little better with the relationship between math and applied-math fields which so often involved Nash directly or ended up being important to the application of what he'd originated as so-called pure mathematics. I was ready to forgive the movie for this -- and while it gives only a suggestion of the math involved, at least it does this well, even exceptionally -- but not the book. There are close to one-hundred pages of notes at the end of Nasar's books -- and seeking those sources is the only hope for those intrigued by Nash's accomplishments or areas of research. The best ""story"" of the book, the only part well-narrated, comes near the end, and involves the Noble Prize and the fight between the Noble committee members over choosing Nash. It's a great story. In the book, after it becomes clear Nash has shown signs of recovering from schizophrenia, a slow and steady progression over ten or twenty years -- Nasar raises the question of whether Nash might have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. No one recovers from schizophrenia, especially without drugs -- that's what people used to think, many still do -- and both book and movie mention this belief. Manic-depression, however, is known to often be well-controlled with medications. I've had direct contact with manic-depressives and relatives of them, much more so than with schizophrenics -- to me there's no question that Nash was not a manic-depressive. On the other hand, from all indications, Nash was someone who suffered, at times severely, from schizophrenia, with paranoid delusions. The paranoid element of his illness may be to some degree realistically and imaginatively treated in the movie. Where the movie strays very far from the truth, in a sort of Disney way, is in the creation of his imaginary college roommate and then later with the roommate's cute little daughter who never ages. Nash never had any hallucinations or delusions of that sort; he imagined aliens were communicating with him, and felt he'd gained knowledge which would help world leaders, presidents and premiers, and even sought to communicate with the Pope. He did clip headlines from newspapers and magazines, as the movie depicts -- in connection with this paranoid-delusional obsession. The character of the roommate is well-acted, however; I personally felt it was an excellent performance. But, be that as it may, especially with the addition of the roommate's daughter, it makes for the movie's major failing. What results is a cuddly and almost kindergarten-level metaphor or simplification as part of the portrait of both the disease and of Nash's experience of it. When I watched the film, despite never having personally known or witnessed someone with schizophrenia -- I had a feeling schizophrenics and their families would find those sequences of the film offensive or simply ridiculously untrue to life. Reading other reviewers' comments, that hunch seems well justified. Nonetheless, granting that the movie departs in some large ways from the real events of Nash's life, and blunders badly with the phantom roommate element -- it's still a great film. Great movies and great books often do have blunders, sometimes serious ones, or weak sections. In this case, I think the movie especially can be forgiven its faults and distortions because of the challenge of portraying such difficult subjects. By that I mean not only Nash himself, as a personality, but more broadly the topics of advanced mathematics and schizophrenia. Secondly, it does have its heart in the right place -- the patient and loving care of family and friends can play a major role in helping mentally-ill people (not to exclude the role of doctors and medical treatments). Finally, I think it's an extraordinary performance by Russell Crowe. He's better in ""The Insider"" -- but from the all-too-little of what Nash was really like in speech and in personal mannerisms which does at times come through in Nasar's book -- Crowe's portrayal has elements of genius. Certainly the scriptwriter deserves recognition, here, too -- since the book provides mainly the film's title and little in the way of dialog or coherent narrative thrust. Some reviewers have complained that Crowe is too much of a muscle-man to portray such an intellectual. But Nash was strong; he lifted weights -- he was physically imposing, especially since he was quite tall as well. So, if you want to complain on behalf of tall-people that it was unfair to select Crowe to play Nash -- OK. But give the idea that smarts and brawn never go together a rest. Nash was not only tall and strong, but as photos and text in Nasar's biography demonstrate -- quite handsome. He had movie-star good looks when he was young and before his illness led to a decline in his dress and appearance."

","With this film Russell Crowe dispels any doubt that his Oscar for Gladiator was deserved. Had Crowe not alienated the entire Hollywood community with his sullen and belligerent manner in the months leading up to voting, he would have won the Best Actor statue for a second time. And while this is a tragedy of Crowe's own doing, it does not eclipse the satisfaction of Ron Howard finally getting his statue for Best Director. <br/><br/>This is a true story that is sometimes a little taxing to watch, and the dizzying contrast between high and low is something that is only poorly attempted by the likes of contemporaries such as Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>Speaking of contrast, naysayers who panned Russell as wooden and two-dimensional in Gladiator will have to eat those words as he renders this complex turn that is filled with both vulnerability and hubris, elation and pathos, genius and madness. After all, that's why they call it acting, which Crowe has more than proved he can do.<br/><br/>There isn't a weak performance in the cast, and the only danger is that Crowe has peaked too high too soon, a'la, say Richard Dreyfuss, or, *gasp* Anna Paquin (Hollywood's most underrated young beauty) and even *double gasp*, Tatum O'Neal, and although nobody can accuse Crowe of being an overnight success, performances like this one make us hope he isn't spent any time soon.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is lyrically beautiful, in which Crowe ascends the throne of the mathematics intelligentsia, meeting his exquisite wife, played beautifully and as a full peer to Crowe by Jennifer Connelly who won a well-deserved Oscar. The second half is, without spoiling it for you, the best suspense you will see since The Sixth Sense. In the end, it wraps up nicely with a bow, and to those whose reviews pretentiously claimed to find the story unbelievable, I can only add, this being a true story, that fact is always stranger than fiction.<br/><br/>Much is left out of Nash's back story, like, among many other things, that he had pronounced homosexual tendencies, and we are never quite given any satisfactory explanation for his descent into madness. Nevertheless, A Beautiful Mind is a towering achievement cinematically, biographically, and historically."

","One of my motivations to see this film was the fact that I have several people in my life who have a mental illness.  I was hoping the film, and the story of Mr. Nash, would shed some light on the subject - the bottom line is that movies are a poor source of Education...<br/><br/>I have a question to the reviewers and makers of this film who also have relationships with the mentally ill - Have you known ANYONE that is schizophrenic who has ""Taken a journey there (into schizophrenia) and returned to SANITY?""  That's a grand delusion in itself, is it not?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm missing the definition of sanity...<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Ron Howard succeeds in Enlightening his audience with Compassion - which, I suppose, is the best justification for the Hollywood machine."

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","2","11 February 2002"," Excellent film
","Saw a Sunday at 9:30 pm show, huge theater, with myself and about 4 other people in attendance.  I guess that's kind of appropriate for this film.  I don't consider this to be tripe.  I think it quite possibly could have been tripe if that last shot of Charles, Marcee, and Parcher had had them suddenly gone after the crowd passed by.  The singular thing for me about the film is that this is not about being cured of mental illness, but rather learning to live with it. <br/><br/>   I guess the point has been made in other films, triumph of the human spirit, live in the heart not in the head, but there is something exceptional about the performances here of Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe, as a hopeful and yet tortured couple.  It's a love story at its core, and in that respect, it's incredibly dignified.  The scene where they first meet in the mental institution is very powerful. <br/><br/>   The score, cinematography, and supporting cast all shine here.  For some reason, I found myself wondering what the little girl was told her part was. Is she a ghost?  Is she John's imaginary friend?  Or did they say that John was a sick person who needed help, and saw things when he wasn't feeling well?  That relationship especially shocked me for some reason.   <br/><br/>
   Finally, I must say though that the film doesn't quite do justice to Nash's theories.  What the heck is he trying to do with the pigeons?  What does traveling in an infinity pattern on a bicycle have to do with his original ideas?  What are the rules of this game that Hansen and Nash are always playing?  And how does ""avoiding the blonde"" evolve into the non-competitive equiilibrium that challenges 150 years of economic theory? <br/><br/>
   THANKFULLY, though, the studio's web site gives a much deeper look at these issues, in a highly entertaining and provocative way.  If they ever get around to having an Oscar for best promotional/info site, they might want to look into that one's combination of educational, recreational resources, and aesthetic beauty.<br/><br/>   Definitely one of the best of 2002, though in terms of playing madness to the hilt and getting us into the mind of the character, Memento's still your best bet."
"Brogan","Null","0","2","7 February 2002"," The movie that Ron Howard should be remembered for.
","I think that when a person is put on Earth, they are put here and in their place for a reason.  I feel that Ron Howard was put here on Earth, not for acting, but for filmmaking. Just like Steven Spielberg, both directors have has a excellent career full of features, but there will the that one film that stands above the rest.  Ironically, both Spielberg and Howard's greatest directing achievements deal with the human spirit.  For StevenSpielberg it is SCHINDLER'S LIST, for Ron Howard, it's A BEAUTIFUL MIND. For years we, as film viewers, have seen movies about human achievements.  FORREST GUMP, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and BRAVEHEART are among the human achievement films.  But those films are about the central character overcoming the odds against society or the system.  A BEAUTIFUL MIND is something much different, it's about overcoming the odds that lie in oneself.  John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe) is a highly intelligent mathematician who is enthusiastic about his solving and completing math problems.  His work and accomplishments have gotten the attention of a government program that has Nash work for the mathematics department along with two co-workers that he went to Princeton with, Sol (Adam Goldberg) and Bender (Anthony Rapp).  Nash not only does number solving, but also teaching, which is how he meets his true devoted love in life Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who later becomes Nash's wife.  It's while working for the government that Nash is recruited by a mysterous agent, Parcher (Ed Harris).  Parcher tells Nash that there is a huge cold war Russian conspiracy, where the Russians are communicating with each other by putting coded messages with letters and words in American newspaper and magazines. It is by doing this that Nash feels that doing highly top secret government work, that he feels that he is being followed and watched, and which leds Nash to become paranoid and fear for Alicia and his own life. What makes A BEAUTIFUL MIND much more different than any other film that I have seen, is that the picture takes you into the mind of John Nash Jr.  You see the world from his view, how he finds the numbers, digits, and letter codes in the media articles; the way he does formulas on how his classmates can succeed on the four of them each leaving the bar with a woman; and by looking at someone's neck tie, how the design can be done identical redone with a crystal drinking glass and sunlight.  It shows that this is a human being who means good for this planet.  Nash only would like to solve formulas and to assit society as much as possible, the same society that he admits that he doesn't get along well with.  But sadly, we see Nash's problems and fears as he feels that the whole world is closing in on him. I have always enjoyed the career of Ron Howard, NIGHT SHIFT, COCOON, BACKDRAFT, FAR & AWAY, & APOLLO 13 are all wonderful films that Howard has shown his talent and skill as a filmmaker.  But there is that one film that manages to amaze the viewer, the movie that you would expect to be good or well done, but it winds up becoming something much more.  A BEAUTIFUL MIND is that film, it gives you a lesson in life, a lesson that will hopefully change the way you would look at life forever. Russell Crowe gives the acting performance of his life with his performance as John Nash Jr.  Crowe shows on his face his fear and frustration that Nash went though when dealing with his psycholigical problems.  It is very rare when a actor gives the ability for the viewer to see and understand the world through their character's eyes and ears.  And when a actor or actress can do that, then that is when they deserve the award for Best Acting for that year.  For a while, I couldn't think that anybody could have done a better acting job this past year than Gene Hackman gave in ROYAL TENENBAUMS, I was amazed and surprised to see Russell Crowe was the person who accomplished that job. Now I am rooting for both Hackman and Crowe for Best Actor, but if I had to lean towards one, I would lean towards Crowe.  I highly enjoyed Hackman's performance, I have never laughed and enjoyed a character so much in years. But when one is in tears by being emotionally touched by the performance that Crowe gives, then you could understand the change in heart.  Perhaps it is because that I understand what Nash is going though since I also have deamons in my mind.  Then again we all have deamons or fear that lurks inside of us, it's what makes us human. And to see one try to overcome those deamons, you can't help but feel for that person. There are also excellent support for Crowe in this film.  Ed Harris as the government agent, Christopher Plummer as Dr. Rosen, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, and Anthony Rapp as Nash's friends all give superb performances in the film.  But the one person who stands out among the support, and almost outshines Crowe's performance is given by Jennifer Connelly.  I have always enjoyed the work of Jennifer Connelly, LABRYNTH, HOT SPOT, and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM have all shown how talented Connelly could be.  But it is in A BEAUTIFUL MIND where Connelly gives the performance of her life as the worried and strongly supportive wife of Nash.  It could have been easy for any other actress go into stereotype cliche and have the character of Alicia break out and yell, ""I can't take this anymore!""  No, instead we get real human emotions as Connelly, playing Alicia, is very much worried about her husband's state of mind. Yet, it is her love for Nash, which is much stronger, is what keeps Alicia supporting Nash. It has been years since I have loved a movie that won Best Picture. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoyed AMERICAN BEAUTY, GLADIATOR, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, TITANIC, and BRAVEHEART.  But there was always that one movie, that I thought, that should have won instead(INSIDER, TRAFFIC, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, APOLLO 13).I have a strong feeling that this film will win Best Picture.  And if it does, then there isn't any other movie this year that deserves it more. This is a monumental success in modern filmmaking, and by all means this movie is a must to be seen.  It should be, since it is now along with ROYAL TENENBAUMS, my favorite film of 2001 (sorry ALI).  *****"

","This is a movie about an intelligent person with schizophrenia. Rather than showing schizophrenia from the perspective of an outside observer, this film uses the perspective of the person with schizophrenia. As the film progresses, you wonder where the schizophrenia kicks in, even though it already has without your knowledge.<br/><br/>As well as this film works as a film, it is very much fantasy. Contrary to what the film leads viewers to believe, schizophrenics don't just will themselves to sanity of some sort. And the depiction of schizophrenia as another dimension that looks just as real as real life is something I doubt the accuracy of, having seen schizophrenia in real people up close and personal.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a good film about a rather extraordinary person. It's a story about someone who beats all the odds and who overcomes great adversity and emerges with their dignity intact, getting everything they dreamed of, but not at all in the expected way.<br/><br/>In short, it's an emotional story tempered by reality's shortcomings, which gives in an unusual edge of believability and which makes the highs and lows higher and lower than usual."

"Quicksand","7","0","2","11 February 2002"," Lesser Than the Sum of Its Parts
","As a critic and student of film myself, my first look at the poster for this film brought mixed emotions: directed by Ron Howard (yes!), written by Akiva Goldsman (oh no!)<br/><br/>A simple glance at Mr. Goldsman's filmography gives a very nice look at a list of movies that range from the non-threateningly mediocre ('A Time to Kill'), to the atrociously horrible ('Batman and Robin,' 'Lost in Space'). I looked forward to this film with the sort of morbid curiosity one usually reserves for a pet with a terminal illness.<br/><br/>The film is not at all horrible.  On the contrary, about 70-75% of it is quite good.  Ron Howard remains one of the most talented directors of our time, and Russell Crowe gives an outstanding, nuanced performance.  Also, there are charismatic and enjoyable performances from supporting players Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.<br/><br/>Despite the best efforts of the supporting players, however, none of them really have much to work with.  Ed Harris almost does, but by the time Goldsman yanks the rug out from under Nash (and the viewer) halfway through the film, I developed an animosity toward 'A Beautiful Mind' that I never recovered from.<br/><br/>Howard does wonderful visual work, as does cinematographer (and Coen Brothers staple) Roger Deakins.  Relating the unique, ulrta-logical way Nash's mind works is no easy task, and Howard rises to it.<br/><br/>The mediocre writing, however, does nothing more than tell a good story badly, and I don't think Howard's visual flare ever makes up for it.  I'm all good and happy that Goldsman saw ""Fight Club,"" but he's not nearly as talented as anyone involved with that film will ever be.<br/><br/>Note to the viewer-- when Christopher Plummer shows up, do yourself a favor: get up, leave, take a bathroom break, or fast forward about 20 minutes into the future.  This bungled plot device fails, but the rest of the film is really about an A-minus.<br/><br/>Ultimately flawed, but a nice homage to the real John Nash.  If those who knew him liked the film, then what else is there to say?"

","Another great film for Russell Crowe and Ron Howard. Crowe is such a powerful presence on the screen. He just commands your attention.

Being said by Russell Crowe is enough for us to know it matters. Very few actors have ever been able to do that, Brando comes to mind. The pleasant surprise from the movie was the script itself. I have heard the buzz for Crowe, and for Connelly...both deservedly so. But, I have not heard much about the power and humor of the script. Akiva Goldsman did a great job, as adapting books is hopefully becoming a specialty (Sum of All Fears is next).

"montandon","Null","0","1","2 February 2002"," Much more human than otherwise.
","As a psychiatrist who has spent thousands of hours talking with mentally ill people, I was eager to see ""A Beautiful Mind"". I wanted to see if this would be the very first movie ever to portray people with schizophrenic illness in a sympathetic light, to avoid the usual stereotypes such as ""really scary psychotic killer"" or ""impossibly weird bag person"".<br/><br/>Alas, we will have to wait<br/><br/>As portrayed in ""A Beautiful Mind"", John Nash is one scary dude. From the scene where he almost lets his infant son drown because he is convinced that his delusional friend Charles is watching the infant while Nash is elsewhere, to the one in which he very nearly assaults his wife in response to a voice telling him she is out to get  him, the film portrays Nash as a man who at any moment can cross over the line to where his delusional ideas create real tragedies. Don't turn your back on this guy!<br/><br/>But putting aside my own agenda, I would have to say that the movie has unusual strengths, thanks to masterful performances by Russell Crowe as John Nash, and by Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia.<br/><br/>Crowe gives a subtle and beautiful performance, and he very nearly pulls it off. Certainly he is good enough in the role that I never once thought ""gladiator"". His John Nash characterization has many sides - the painfully uncomfortable boy-man at Princeton, the sardonic humorist, the deservedly arrogant professional mathematician, the scared, pitiful recipient of the full onslaught of psychotically imagined auditory hallucinations - and these characterizations almost work. But the young Nash, although a standout eccentric in his early graduate studies, is not really weird enough to portray the estrangement that must have been his lot as, in the midst of intense creative efforts, he was already struggling with a delusional system he could not always distinguish from reality. And even in the throes of his worst psychotic nightmares, when he lashes out at the doctor who comes to intervene on his behalf, he is too contained. But what Crowe does get right in the performance is a lot. Somehow he has managed to learn the peculiar and highly idiosyncratic posture and gait that many people with schizophrenia display and which is unmistakable to the trained eye. Particularly nice, I thought, was how Crowe's Nash could recover from lethal social gaffes with quick wit and charm, as for example during his visit back at Princeton where he is asking the new department chairman (and his old nemesis from graduate school) if he might return to the campus to teach. In the midst of their conversation, Nash is convulsed by his delusion, and lashes out at an imagined presence. He then turns to the startled chairman and asks, ""Is there any way that you could forget what I just did?""<br/><br/>As Alicia, Jennifer Connelly gives a moving performance as Nash's once and future wife. Falling in love with a man who can find everything in the starry heavens, and who knows the universe is infinite, she is quickly disillusioned as he succumbs to an illness which was even more of a curse in 1954 than it is today. She withstands seeing her husband subjected to dozens of gruesome insulin shock ""treatments"" and later, when he is home from the hospital, has to contend with his withdrawal, lack of affection, and creative stupor, partially side effects of the drug Thorazine, which was the only useful treatment way back then. When Nash recognizes the drug's deleterious effects on himself and stops the medication, he is quickly thrust back into the terror. Nevertheless, in the movie at least, she stands by her man. She comforts him when she can, and confronts him when she must, and gradually he begins to come out of the illness. Some may feel that the relationship of John and Alicia was the smaltziest part of this movie, the least isomorphic mapping from any of John Nash's real biography to the world of the silver screen. But to me it was the most real, because I have seen how important such a relationship is to a person struggling to emerge from mental illness. Next to the medication, it counts for everything.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with the woman who is my boss at the mental health center where I work. We spent a long time afterwards talking about it. She said something I thought was particularly true. She said, ""What Ron Howard has done is to give us a movie not about a ""schizophrenic"", as if the term ""schizophrenic"" defined the person, but about a person who happens to have the illness schizophrenia.""<br/><br/>I for one hope that other artists will build on this work. Maybe people are ready to understand that, in the words of the iconoclastic hero of American psychiatry Harry Stack Sullivan, ""People with schizophrenia are much more human than otherwise."""

It never drags, and is always convincing.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciated about it was that I did not feel over-stimulated. Sometimes I think Hollywood just tries too hard to make you go ""wow!"" Instead, this movie chose to take on the pace and character of reality. It was like floating along on the river of this man's life.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe was the height of the movie -- not the least of the performance was an Australian doing a West Virginia accent, which I thought he pulled off most credibly, at least most of the time.  The woman playing the wife was not as good, though exceptionally beautiful, which is not a bad thing in a movie.  Also the man playing the roommate was very good.<br/><br/>
I didn't realize that Ron Howard, whom I can never stop thinking of as Opie, was the director until the closing credits.  Well little Opie grew up and done good!  It's funny how I almost feel like he was a childhood friend, albeit from a different state.<br/><br/>I have read that in some ""primitive"" societies, schizophrenics are treated quite differently from here.  They can be regarded as religious mystics and are encouraged to talk about their visions.  Some people think that this treatment actually works better than what we do.  This movie certainly makes one wonder whether that might not be true."

We are never really told why Nash is famous or if he actually did work for the CIA.  The love story between his wife (Jennifer Connely) is, again, not realistic in it's approach. Why does she fall in love with him and, more importantly, why do they get married and stay together.  Russell Crowe is good as John Nash, but the distance created between the actor and the audience is too much.  Jennifer Connely is good as well, but it is hard to figure her character out.  I never felt attached to either character, and didn't want to root for them to overcome.  Some of the scenes between the two are so over-the-top; the star-gazing scene is especially silly.  The last half hour of the movie is better, as we know what is going on and his life is explained.  The first portion of the movie is distant and cold, leaving a lot desired by the audience who wants to know who this guy is and what is really going on.  It is unlike ""The Sixth Sense"" when it is such a cool surprise when you find out he is actually dead. The imaginary characters in his head are never explained to having any relevance to his disease.  Not that is has to be spelled out, but why a little girl and his best friend who he never had.

As a biography of a nobel prize winners life, it doesn't stand up to much close scrutiny, but as a piece of cinematic entertainment it is as fine a piece of cinema as I have seen all year. I am continually surprised by Russell Crowe's acting abilities. I was reminded of 'The Insider' almost straight away, in that 'little man, fighting against the odds' kind of way.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is, as usual, brilliant, if a little underused.<br/><br/>The most surprising performance of all was that of Jennifer Connelly.

This is far and away the best performance of an eclectic career so far. <br/><br/>If the detractors of this film think of this as cinema, and not biography, these people may just gain more from it than they have so far.

","A BEAUTIFUL MIND is the story of how a talented man, bound by a desire to put his craft to work, attempted to defeat disability, and went on to receive praise from his contemporaries. You might think that I have successfully described the trials of the Russell Crowe character (John Nash) in the film, and how, with the help of his wife, handled schizophrenia while going on the win the Nobel Prize. The problem is, I didn't. This really isn't the plot of the movie. In fact, the plot of this film involves what went on behind the scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>We live in a time where Hollywood cannot even make a decent character study without placing it in some predefined genre with the intent of increasing box office revenue. I couldn't help but consider this while watching A BEAUTIFUL MIND. That's not to say I didn't feel satisfied with Russell Crowe's performance. To put it bluntly, this is some of the best acting you will ever see. Unfortunately, A BEAUTIFUL MIND becomes a psychological thriller that leads to a pithy resolution that ""love conquers all"".<br/><br/>
I can only suspect that this was not the film that Ron Howard wanted to make. Don't get me wrong, I've never identified Howard as being some kind of independent spirit or unconventional filmmaker. After all, Howard did direct THE GRINCH. But here is why what went behind the scenes overshadows the story: Howard does put a lot of emphasis on character development, and I could sense his desire to give John Nash's story full emphasis with a studio pressuring him to make a thriller. As a result, the film is kind of half-baked. We become more concerned with whether John Nash is delusional or not. At least, I was.<br/><br/>I still recommend A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Crowe's performance is the reason to see it, along with praiseworthy performances by Ed Harris, Adam Goldberg, and Christopher Plummer. This was also one of the few times I've went to see a film where the audience applauded at the end. I can't help but praise an action star like Russell Crowe for transcending the Hollywood genre.

As a mathematician myself, I was impressed, not so much by the glimpses of mathematics this film gives the viewer, but in the way the academic culture at the very highest levels is recreated.  Things have not changed that much from John Nash's early days at Princeton to the present time at any major university.<br/><br/>But, like ""Good Will Hunting"", this movie ultimately is about much more than mathematics.  The story of John Nash, his brilliance and madness, brought back many memories for me personally.  The consuming fire that goes with mathematical research is wonderfully depicted here.  His illness, paranoid schizophrenia, is so well portrayed by Russell Crowe, that I found myself thinking about my best friend who was driven to suicide by his manic-depressive illness.  I marvel that Dr. Nash's wife endured all the years of loneliness and emotional deprivation, but I understand because I went through much the same myself as my best friend struggled and ultimately lost his own battle.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Ron Howard's films.  They tend to overdramatize the emotional side of any situation he examines, and there are times I think he stoops to cheap sensationalism in order to make a point.  I did not get that impression with this film, however.  Akiva Goldsman's script and Russell Crowe's acting combine to lead the viewer into the wild labyrinth of an unbalanced, albeit brilliant, mind without resorting to cheap tricks to keep the viewer engaged.  The supporting cast sparkles as they make the viewer truly see what Dr. Nash sees, and without their performances, this movie would have been a colossal failure.  This movie is a real keeper.

"TheMerovingian","Null","0","1","26 January 2002"," An important message that many may miss
","NOTE:  Possible Spoiler!!!!<br/><br/>""A Beautiful Mind"" has been reviewed thoroughly enough by others before me, so I want to focus on two aspects that made an impact on me, which I have *not* seen mentioned in the reviews.<br/><br/>First, that the movie accurately depicts the social discomfort of many high IQ individuals.  I have worked with many certified geniuses over the years, and can say with confidence that many, many of them are uncomfortable with people and eventually become anti-social.  They are treated as ""different"" from the start and they never feel they ""fit in"".  By the beginning of the movie, John Nash has already given up on trying to fit in.  He knows that people don't much like him, so he sees no reason to be diplomatic or tactful.  It is not conceit.  It's often a tradeoff for gifted people - expend a *lot* of effort learning to get along, or direct that effort toward your intellectual pursuits.  I thought the subtle remarks that helped define and explain this personality were very insightful - especially when, while sitting on the pond's edge, John explains to Alicia that he is often direct (and often misunderstood) simply because he desires to take the most efficient route to gathering information.<br/><br/>The other (and much more important) issue that is presented is that of John's decision to deal with his illness without medication.  There is a pivotal moment in the movie that a lot of people missed, when John decides that with his IQ he might be able to find a way to deal with it ""naturally"". And he does.  He does ""something extraordinary"".  Considering how many times the actors have used that term both in the movie and in interviews, it would seem that more people would ""get it"".  He didn't take ""the easy way out"".  It *is* possible to overcome mental illness without therapy or medication.  I have seen it done and it's a thrill to watch as someone beats it by themselves, forever knowing that *they* have control.<br/><br/>Yes, it may take a ""most genius"" to do this with something as severe as schizophrenia, but regular folks can and do beat anxiety and depression on their own.  It's not easy but it's certainly worth it.  If this movie can send that message to the world - if enough people just *think* that *maybe* it's possible - it will stand as a society-changing film.  Don't miss the message."

"johnprestonevans","7","0","1","3 February 2002"," A Beautiful Performance
","Based on the real life of genius mathmatician John Nash, this film takes liberties with its events, but ultimately serves up a great movie about a man in madness.  Russell Crowe is fantastic as Nash.  This is a signature performance that will captivate moviegoers with a magnetic energy.  Nash's slow but steady decent into paranoid pscyzophrenia is troubling, puzzling and heartbreaking.  The character ages 50 years through the course of the film, weaving him in and out of delusions that are not made clear until the midpoint of the movie.  The first half is remenicent of the clever trickery and manipulation that the 6th Sense had, and until you realize he has this delusional disorder, you dont understand that half of what is one the screen is not real.  The 2nd half of the picture depicts Nash's struggle to overcome the illness on his own terms - using his ""beautiful mind"" to beat his degeneration.  He is a complex character, at times insecure, and others extremely arrogant and blunt, obsessed with his mathematic breakthroughs and fantasy life as a Pentagon agent.  Jennifer Connolley is good as his wife, who stands by John through decades of uncertainty and maddness.  The ending feels a bit too sweet and nice to feel very real.  It will leave you questioning how much liberty director Ron Howard exercised with the script. A good film nonetheless.  Final Rating = 7.4/10"

Ron Howard has made yet another enjoyable film... I've yet to see him make a bad one. Jennifer Connelly is Nash's steadfast wife who defies all the conventional rules and stands by her husband as he fights a nightmarish battle against schizophrenia. She gives a good performance but I don't think it's Oscar material. It's basically like Gwenyth Paltrow's popularity campaign a few years ago for ""Shakespeare in Love"".

Although the story was a bit of fiction (they somehow left out the real reason Nash left Wheeler Labs), it was actually a beautiful, inspiring and powerful story. In addition to the excellent story and directing, the acting was fabulous. When we sat down in the theatre, I said to my girlfriend ""Russell Crowe has a monumental task ahead of him: convincing me that he's a math dork, not General Maximus or Officer Bud White.""  I have to say that if anyone deserves an Oscar this year it is Russell Crowe.  He makes the audience compassionate for his character in a way that is not often seen.  Paul Bettany, Jennifer Conolley, and Ed Harris were also excellent in the supporting cast.  Overall, I gave this movie a '10.'  It is rare when Hollywood puts out such a wonderful movie.

","I have to admit that this movie was very good, although I don't think it is as great as the rest of the world, apparently.  Nash's sickness was exploited for dramatic purposes (in actuality, he might think he is seeing someone, but would not actually think he is rubbing a little girl's hair or kissing her forehead in thin air).  The directing was adequate, but utilitarian.  I wonder if most people know what a director actually does, or if they just lump the categories of best movie and best director together. Ron, I think we have seen enough of the shot with the camera revolving around Cameron Crowe's head by the third time you used it.  The acting was great all around.  The script was also good, but included only selected parts of Nash's life - only those that make him seem like a wonderful man. The writers chose to leave the parts of his real life out like when he got divorced, had illegitimate children, etc.  I guess that would have negated the ending (spoiler?)  This movie was pretty good - a 7 or 8 out of 10 - but I just don't like watching somebody's tragic life embellished for entertainment purposes."

","I know that most critics, would like to leap at the chance of giving Russel Crowe credit for his performance in anything he has ever made, but i'm going to make my point. Russel Crowe is hollywood's most.... hmm... what's that word again?.... Oh yeah.... OVERRATED actor since Leonerdo Dicrapio. I know that most uneducated critics enjoy those tear jerking moving instant ""classics"" more than anything else in the world, but I have a few points to make about why you should think differently about this film, and all the others like it.<br/><br/>A. for all of you teenybopping 12-18 year olds that think that if the academy likes it, than it must be good, let me make one thing clear these oscar winning tear jerkers will pass on within the next 5 years (Does any one still consider Titanic one of the best films ever made like they did when it came out.)<br/><br/>B. Ron Howard is one of my favourite directors, and part of the reasons I thought less of this film is that it seemed to me that he was setting out to make one of those oscar winning tearjerkers, more than he was trying to make A point about the acual issue in the film.<br/><br/>C. Any actor, that was in an oscar winning performance the previous year will have an overhyped movie the next year, which is what Warren Beatty was implying in his quote ""The Golden Globes are fun, The Oscars are buisness. Russel Crowe won best actor for Gladiator last year that is why A Beautiful mind is overhyped in my opinion.<br/><br/>I am not at all saying that this is a bad film, the performances are quite good, especially from Jenifer Connely,  i'm just saying the people praising it like it's some sort of an event in film making really need to get their lips off of Russel Crowe's ass for a bit and start realizing what they are saying."

"dw_krause","9","0","1","24 January 2002"," If you can believe it, this is a love story. a maddening and seductive one.
","The credits rolled and immediately my inner me said, ""Best Picture."" I say this a lot, of course, technically I'm allowed to say it five times a year. But I added, ""Winner. No doubt"" this time around- Never said that before. But, A Beautiful Mind is an Oscar darling. And it's appeal has never been so obvious- Character frailty, heroism, a powerful love story, resonant acting and writing and despite all the backlash from critics and purists regarding it's sexual ambiguity, something Blockbuster can carry. Remember American Beauty, in comparison, had subtle references too (actually to me they were blatant, but hey this is a general forum) and it still snagged the big statue.<br/><br/>Which leaves me to Russell Crowe, whose performance in The Insider was as close to perfect as an actor can get (He 'vus robbed!). Of course, the voters knew their mistake (although it took him a year- see Gladiator- to get it right). To the film: Crowe's versatility simply baffles me here, once again, reaching deep within who knows where to become the math genius and Nobel Prize- winning John Nash. His preparation has to be extremely unique to continually put forth this much passion into each role. I'd love to know what he does- anyone?<br/><br/>The film doesn't work, though, without Jennifer Connelly. As Nash's wife, she provides a potent chemistry with Crowe and an energetic calm that slowly creeps up on you. Not sure how, but I swear she steals some scenes away from Russy- but that's real, real chemistry folks, not the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks kind. Anyway, all the sudden, after all the math wizardry, the psycho-babble and surprises (everyone knows this about a schizophrenic I'm sure, but there is an awesome shocker in here too) you come to realize. damn this is a love story!<br/><br/>Thus, we steer are way to the captain of the ship. Ron Howard's direction here is, again, impressive- almost seducing you into understanding and thinking along with Nash's motives and emotional battles with himself and his relationships- the will-he or won't-he's are jarring and paradoxal, fun and draining all at once. A Beautiful Mind is by far Howard's most complete and compelling work  as well as his most important. Of course, he's working with talented actors who helped drive the films dramatic and emotional ranges. and a solid script. or should I say book. I'm not completely sold on Howard as a great director. I believe most of his films are largely in the IMDB 6-7 range, but this is definitely one that he deserves a 9 for. How much all this praise and these awards to come are a credit to him remains to be seen. Either way, A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful and unique love story. It shouldn't be missed by anyone."
"silly_al","Null","0","1","23 January 2002"," Reality?
","I went an saw ""A Beautiful Mind"" right before the Golden Globes because I figured Crowe would win the best actor award, and since I was still sore about his Oscar for the horrendous ""Gladiator,"" I knew it would be best to see his performance in something a little more challenging.<br/><br/>I really liked ""A Beautiful Mind.""  I thought that Ron Howard's directing was sort of pompous and self-serving, but he made a statement and I can forgive Opie for being selfish.  I really liked Jennifer Connelly and thought that she was probably the best kind of actress for the role - not too famous, but not completely wet behind the ears.<br/><br/>The story, however warm and bubbly, misses reality somewhere....perhaps during the ""love conquers all part.""  Someone else commented that it is dangerous to portray the life of a Schizophrenic as being curable once the patient finds their true love.  The commentator noted that is unusual for someone with such an extreme case to have love beat the odds and then they certainly wouldn't be cured because of love.<br/><br/>Now here is my real beef with this movie....while it is BASED on John Forbes Nash, Jr., it is not a true story.  Sure, he won the Pulitzer and yes, he was married to Alicia.  In real life, however, he was divorced from Alicia and he had a long-time affair with a woman who bore him a son out of wedlock.  While I have no personal gripe against the man and his decisions, I think it odd that the filmmakers would alter his life so much on the screen.  And would, therefore, alter the reality of Nash and his disease.<br/><br/>While Crowe, Opie, and the lot might pat themselves on the backs and think they made a gripping tale about the life of a Schizophrenic paranoid, I hope that viewers will look past all the hype and see that this disease is not curable with love and may cause a person to never have the opportunity for love.  That would be a greater and more tragic story....something that would deserve recognition and award - not the same old Hollywood sap."

"nathan19","Null","0","1","22 January 2002"," Adjusting perceptions
","As most are at least aware of the story of ""A Beautiful Mind,"" I see no reason to re-cap.  The tale of John Forbes Nash has been brought beautifully to the screen, with much tenderness, compassion and grace.  It is ultimately an exhortation to adjust our own perceptions -- to see the world not just as it is, but as it can be.<br/><br/>The film is full of changing perspectives.  Nash already sees the world in a different light when we first meet him -- as the film goes on, he begins to adjust himself, to conform to the human race, to learn of love and compassion.  We watch him warm up to his Princeton compatriots, and see his heart open to Alicia.  Not only this, but Alicia must change her perspective as well.  In the midst of John's bumbling proposal, Alicia says, ""I need to adjust my girlish notions of romance,"" and later on, while dealing with her husband's illness, tells a friend that when she is faced with the man as he is, she learns to open her eyes and see him as the man he was...""and suddenly I become that man's wife.""<br/><br/>It would be easy for a film such as this to draw Nash's mental struggles and triumphs with a black-and-white brush -- the demons he face must be conquered, and he must overcome them.  Instead, the film bravely squares the notion that perhaps (in the words of Norman Bates) we all go a little mad sometimes... and that it is a braver thing to live with your demons than to eliminate them.  (This side of glory, what hope do we have of getting away from the demons which haunt us all?)  As Nash says towards the end of the film -- ""they're still there, I just choose to ignore them.""  By refusing to demonize paranoid schizophrenia, the film casts the notion that, just perhaps, the line between sanity and insanity is not as fixed as it appears, and therefore those who struggle cannot be demonized or marginalized, but instead given the grace they need to survive.<br/><br/>Perhaps those among us who struggle with their own demons, are in need not of extensive therapy and violent treatment -- it's clear in the film that such treatment marginalizes and reduces Nash -- but instead of understanding, tenderness, and love.  I do not wish to minimize the plight of those who struggle with mental illness -- sometimes a straitjacket is as much a protection of them from us as it is the other way around.  With family members myself who struggle with varying degrees of mental illness, I know that love isn't all you need.  However, there is perhaps more of a need for it in the world than we are willing to give.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is a testimony of and about grace.  Nash, by all accounts, is a wretched soul, lonely, brilliant, tortured.  There is no immediate reason why any one should love him.  But it is the grace (undeserving favor) of Alicia that draws him in, that holds him in the midst of his personal Hell, and which gives him the strength he needs to be what he can.  May it be so of all of us."
"mrcolmer","10","0","1","21 January 2002"," Remarkable!
","Even before A Beautiful Mind, I admired Jennifer Connelly, especially from Requiem for A Dream. Now I am enamored by her. What a remarkable performance in a truly understated role. From what could have been a shadow dressing performance, Jennifer made her mark from the first scene in Nash's classroom, coming across determined and powerful yet understated, to the last at Nash's acceptance of the Nobel Prize (in heavy makeup to the point you cannot recognize her). The genuine love, adoration and support shines through. Without having seen the movie or listening to Nash's speech, you know why she is there. Playing what I consider emotional courage is difficult. Jennifer has set herself apart from the field.<br/><br/>Oh and that Russell Crowe is not so bad either. Setting aside Proof of Life, Russell has had a remarkable three-year run. From The Insider to Gladiator to A Beautiful Mind, Russell has shown the ease and skill to transforms oneself from character to character. It is astonishing to believe those were all the same person. But that is what an quality actor is supposed to do.<br/><br/>
Ron Howard, the fantastical director of such fare as Willow, Cocoon and Splash, has redefined his abilities. Movies with no epic background or splashy effects but simply strong characters and story are perhaps the most difficult to direct. Robert Redford direction of Ordinary People was just the same. The movie is less about Nash's condition than it is about how love makes us crazy and how love heals us all. These can be subtly portrayed issues unless you have the wisdom and eye to protract them. Ron has brought out the best in his performers and brought out the best in John Nash, a man whose accomplishments or name I had never heard. The movie lets you know that you do not have to be crazy to be brilliant. But it helps.<br/><br/>Come Oscar time, expect to hear these names over and over again."

","I enjoyed this movie and agree with most of the comments I have read. However, I do have a strong reservation.<br/><br/>Ron Howard has chosen a story with an all-too-familiar plot: misunderstood outsider succeeds famously.  And with a typical Hollywood-Academy-Award treatment, he focuses on charm and action rather than portray anything that might challenge us to think and understand.  Exactly what was it that Nash produced which led to the Nobel Prize?  We have no clue.  Instead we're treated to clever dialog, wild action scenes, guns, and car chases, emotional trauma, and occasional, eccentric mathematical scribbling on windows which is supposed to convey profundity. The reason Nash's biography is more interesting than most is the influential theories he developed. Emptying the piece of this intellectual content insults our intelligence and undermines the deep significance of the story."

","Overall I did enjoy this movie.  Crowe was excellent portraying a troubled mathematician.  However, the story of John Nash itself simply isn't all that interesting and one gets the impression that Hollywood is trying too hard to make a story out of nothing.  I mean Nash's mental conditions was heavily emphasized throughout the film that it came across more on a movie about mental disorders.  I wished the film devoted more time emphasizing Nash's contributions to mathematics and why his contributions were important.  At the very end you do hear a bit about that but that was much too late after 2 hrs worth of riding through Nash's mental problems.  This movie had chances to become really good, but instead of going deeper into explaining in layman's terms the contributions of Nash, so we can appreciate his ""beautiful mind"", we get carried away into Nash's nightmares and drowned for 2 hrs in Nash's mental state that could've been explained in 15 minutes. The movie echoed the sixth sense the way Nash's sees ""people"" around him all the time and it just got ridiculous in that aspect."

His appearance becomes increasingly disturbing as the film moves along. Ron Howard's direction is flawless. He has finally proved to the world that he is an amazing director and no list of the best contemporary directors is complete unless it bears his name. The brightest gem in this film is Jennifer Connelly. Her performance is so real that you can't help but feel her pain in coping with her schizophrenic husband. Her performance as Alicia is worth every supporting actress accolade in the books. Ed Harris gives his best performance ever in a supporting role as Nash's antagonist. He appearance is so subtle it is absolutely terrifying. James Horner's musical score is grade A even compared to his previous work on Titanic and Glory.

","The best thing you can do for yourself before you see this movie is to stay away from all reviews! There is an element of surprise that is essential to this flick that the reviews are all giving away. If you haven't seen it yet, then don't read the rest of this. * * * * * *<br/><br/>This is a biopic of celebrated math scholar and economics Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash, who suffered(here's the spoiler) from paranoid schrizophrenia. The film opens with his foray into school at Princeton, where is is already a social outcast, a quirky genius, and an excessive worrier of finding `that one orginial idea.' It is here he meets his best friend, roomate Charles (Paul Bettany), and his wife, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). He gets his idea, impresses the professors, lands a plum assignment at MIT, and marries Alicia. Life seems to be rolling along.<br/><br/>Suddenly John finds himself in the middle of a plot to keep the Russians from obliterating America because he's an expert code-breaker. His life becomes a turmoil of secrecy and paranoia as he feverishly works to find conspiracies in magazines. When he fears danger, his paranoia gets out of hand, until Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) commits him to an institute and declares him crazy.<br/><br/>Here's where the bulk of the film begins, and why it was important not to know whether he was crazy or not before seeing this. As you're watching this film, you're wondering, too, what is real and what is not. Is he really part of government work and is America in danger? Or are they delusions in his own mind? Not knowing anything about the film before I went it, it was exciting to watch; it is essential that the audience doesn't know what's real or what's made up because then you understand to some extent what John is going through. Had I read the synopses beforehand, I would have been robbed of this brillant cinematic trick.<br/><br/>I don't know if the producers meant for that to happen, or didn't care if we were let in on the joke, but I do give them credit for not giving it away in the trailers. Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance as the backbone of the world crumbling around her; Ed Harris and Paul Brittany steal the show, and it doesn't hurt that Adam Goldberg is in it, either. Russell Crowe may see yet another Oscar nomination his way(though a particular gripe of mine is that how many math geniuses have the good looks or the physique of Russell Crowe? Hubba hubba). He does portray John with amazing emotion and wit throughout. I did find a few flaws with some of the scenes but it's Hollywood afterall. I thought it did a remarkable turn from your basic social-outcast-genius story to one of intrigue, excitement, and human spirit."

","Crowe is an actor that I have never really enjoyed watching.  The only film of his that I actually liked was The Insider.  In everything else, his acting was decent at best.  I knew that he was a great actor, he just needed some great material to work with.  And in A Beautiful Mind, he gets that material.  After a year of absolutly horrible films, this one is a great escape.  I don't want to say anything to give away the story line or plot, because this is a movie that everyone should enjoy and see with a clear mind.

"jaywelt","8","0","1","17 January 2002"," Beautiful Glimpse - Dangerous Theme.
","I'm very torn over rating the job Ron Howard has done on this film.  There are hints of brilliance in the film, along with major gaps in character development and the portrayal of a theme that I think could be irresponsible. (See the last full paragraph for explanation on the problem with the theme.)<br/><br/>It is difficult to say who deserves credit for exposing the horror of Schizophrenia.  Howard, Crowe, and the writers, Akiva Goldsman and Slvia Nasar all deserve consideration.  I suspect one of these four if not all of them has dealt with Schizophrenia on a very personal level.  All deserve credit for creating a wonderful and worthwhile movie to watch.  The portrayal of this illness was accomplished as well as I've ever seen done in a film, and that alone makes seeing it worth the price of admission. Russell Crowe is nearly perfect in this role. Despite a rumored comment* illustrating a complete lack of understanding of what Schizophrenia is, Crowe's performance pulls you so deeply into the movie, you may find yourself forgetting about the scrambled plot. Watching; is an exercise in voyeurism.  We get small glimpses into the life of John Nash here and there, but not quite the whole story.   Howard and Crowe team up well to portray `what it's like,' but I'm afraid the story was fragmented and left me unsatisfied.  I want to know more about John Nash.  If not for the brilliant glimpse into the undesirable `life' a Schizophrenic lives, this movie would not satisfy as well on other levels.  If you were to take Crowe's performance out, you may be left with a dull biography suitable for late night television.<br/><br/>***Possible Spoiler****<br/><br/>I've been trying to decide what I think of the first 45 minutes to an hour of this movie.  In one respect I feel cheated and tricked.  (Very well tricked I might add.  - Kudos to Howard on that.)  In the other respect, I think it is vital to feeling how `tricked' a Schizophrenic person can feel. I think the decision to take the movie on this route, accomplishes one goal while hindering the other.  On the one hand, it takes us on the hellish journey many Schizophrenics face; on the other hand it makes a mess of the plot and throws the continuity off.  If we were to say the plot is not so important, and that experiencing Schizophrenia is what it is all about here, then I would have to say this movie is a 10.<br/><br/>***End Spoiler***<br/><br/>One thing about this movie concerns me.  As the movie is coming to an end we start to see a `Love conquers all' theme emerge.  While love is powerful and beautiful, and quite possibly all we need, it cannot cure Schizophrenia. Many who suffer from Schizophrenia would be extremely lucky to ever experience the kind of romantic love John Nash is portrayed as receiving in this film.  I hope that not too many people afflicted with this disease watch this movie and come away thinking they need to run out and find someone to love them romantically in order to achieve their dreams and live a full life.  One of the major and most basic horrors that come with this disease is not portrayed in this film.  That Horror is; that many schizophrenics go their entire lives  - and never experience True Love.  I can't think of anything more horrific than that.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to the family of John Nash for allowing Hollywood into their lives.  Thank you for allowing your lives to be scrutinized in order to raise awareness of this illness.<br/><br/>*I heard that in an interview Crowe made reference to Schizophrenia as a ""multiple personality disorder"".  I do not know if this is true."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","0","2","22 January 2002"," Something extraordinary
","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is an extraordinary movie with a powerful performance from Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash. John Nash is the Princeton mathematician who wrote the founding paper on game theory, and has battled schizophrenia almost his entire adult life. In Crowe's acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, he said that ""...Hopefully, we made a movie that made you believe that something extraordinary is possible."" Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, and a talented cast have done so. <br/><br/>Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman created a story about humanity, and a touching love story. Goldsman streamlined some of the events of Silvia Nasar's book, and maintained coherence. Howard does not compromise on the perception of the young John Nash, who was a genius, and also an arrogant loner-- not good with people. At the same time we have compassion for Nash's plight given an enlightened view of schizophrenia. The scene in which we discover Nash's condition is purely masterful on Howard's part. Nash's journey is amazing.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is simply awesome. He can convey what is in Nash's mind with either a look or in dialog. Crowe has such a range of intensity, and is always believable. Crowe's Nash ages 50 years over the course of the movie. At the core of the movie is a great love story. Jennifer Connelly is a revelation as Alicia Nash, John's wife. Connelly as Alicia says that John ""transforms into the man that she loves."" Connelly's Alicia has such a capacity for courage and doing what is right. She loves John. She stands by him and raises their family. Her Alicia suffers and remains strong. There are also great supporting performances from Christopher Plummer as Nash's psychiatrist, and from Ed Harris and Paul Bettany. <br/><br/>John Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994 and continues to teach at Princeton. He still accepts and deals with schizophrenia. This is very touching and truly a triumph of the human spirit. Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have created something extraordinary. They move, touch, and inspire us."

","In these times of weak screenplays, below average direction, and sub-par acting it is refreshing to know some movies can still impress and inspire me. I have seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" twice already and was mind boggled by the power and quality of Russell Crowe's portrayal of the brilliant and troubled John Nash Jr. His performance ranks right up there with the other performers who portrayed troubled or disabled individuals, most notably Jack Nicholson in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", Robert De Niro in ""Awakenings"", Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" and Al Pacino in ""Scent of a Woman"". Ron Howard's direction is superb, blending acting talents by not packing a lot of superstar punch into this film but by unleashing the power from his lead character and supporting figures.

","After critics' came down hard on his last film (""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""), director Ron Howard comes back with a bang with ""A Beautiful Mind"". Academy voters out there reading this review, listen up! You unfairly snubbed Howard of a Best Director Oscar nomination 6 years ago for his brilliant ""Apollo 13"", and if you decide to snub him of a Best Director nomination this year for ""A Beautiful Mind"", you will be sorry. Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. ""A Beautiful Mind"" tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make ""A Beautiful Mind"" the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book). ""A Beautiful Mind"" might give ""Lord of the Rings"" a run for the Oscars come this March. It's a great movie. <br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

","Following the end of World War II the world was gripped in a fear that lasted into the 1990s. that was known as the `Cold War' and resulted as mass panic that was spread by the media regarding the threat of Communism. Entire communities of sane and rational people began to see Communist agents lurking everywhere and even went so far as to blame innocent people of being in league or sympathetic to Communist ideologies. While a time of deep fears, it was also a time of great secrets that were conceived and created by some of the greatest minds of our times. In some cases, people were asked to live secret lives and keep the nature of their work hidden from everyone, including their spouses. It was the work of great minds in secret that brought on the end of World War II by the creation of the atomic bomb, and the threat of Communism drove the government to new heights of security. In `A Beautiful Mind' viewers are taken to 1947 and introduced to a young man named John Nash (Russell Crowe) who attended Princeton University on a scholarship. A brilliant man, who lacked social skills and the discipline to attend class, Nash nevertheless continued to seek for his original idea that would set him apart from his peers. Despite being ridiculed by his peers for his lack of charm and social skills, Nash made a few friends amongst his peer group and set about to disprove an economic theory that had stood as the basis for all economics for 150 years. John's hard work pays off as he proves his theory and shows the flaws and new solutions for the old beliefs. The discovery is hailed by his teachers and peers as a brilliant discovery and soon lands Nash a coveted position at a top defense laboratory. It is while working at the lab that John receives a mysterious visitor who asks him to help break a complex Russian code. John is able to solve the code in no time at all, and is soon working for the Defense Department undercover as a code breaker. The uncanny skill that John displays attracts the attention of Johnathan Parchar (Ed Harris), a secret operative who oversees John and his assignments. It seems that that Johns lack family and friends is a desirable trait, as he has nothing to distract him from his work nor compromise national security.<br/><br/>John seems very content in his work and all is fine in his life. While teaching a class, John meets a beautiful young lady named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and the two soon fall in love and marry. Just when things should be perfect in John's life, his secret life starts to interfere on his normal life, and drives John to the edge of sanity. The brilliant John Nash who is capable of solving the most difficult and complex equations known to man, and is now having to come to grips with what his life has become as the lines between reality and fantasy start to blur, and the clarity and order of his equations becomes unraveled as does his life. The film is directed by Ron Howard from a script by Akiva Goldsman and is based on the real life story of John Nash that was chronicled in the book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar.  Howard's directing is strong and he paces the film brilliantly. The life of Nash is gripping, and Howard allows the audience to develop a bond between the characters at a steady pace and shows their strengths as well as their flaws. The real story of the film is Crowe who gives a brilliant performance as Nash. He is gripping, and able to transform himself into his character so completely that he becomes Nash and viewers will forget that he is playing a role. Crowe deserves to get an Academy Award nomination for his performance, which is superior to his Oscar winning role in `Gladiator' The film shows the triumph and tragedy of life, as well as the beauty of the human spirit to overcome and survive.  An effective and very good film and the supporting roles portrayed by Harris and Connelly are strong and compelling, as they support but never overpower the brilliant performance of Crowe in this Oscar worthy film.<br/><br/>5 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach"

This movie can almost be considered a low budget, or independent film. Russell Crowe delivers an Oscar caliber performance as the tortured Nash; head and shoulders above his Gladiator role. Crowe gives in completely to the Nash character. Jennifer Conelly is excellent as Nashs wife Alicia. The last I saw her she was flaunting for the camera in ""Inventing the Abbotts."" Her performance is also Oscar worthy. Hopefully, this part will lead to more roles.

So maybe a movie like this seems better than it is but the acting was great especially Russell Crowe. The dialogue was above average containing some subtle lines and didn't seemed dumbed down for the audience. Perhaps there were moments of over sentimentality, but I admit I got caught up in it and felt some emotion for the characters particularly toward the end.<br/><br/>Some critics are annoyed that some aspects of Nash's life were left out, mostly the unsavory ones which probably made him appear a more sympathetic character than he actually was in real life. Such as that he had some bisexual experiences. I understand that criticism but look, I don't want to see John Nash take a crap on screen nor do I want to see him fooling around with another man, so those critics should shut up. I don't see how a few gay scenes would have added to the story.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie and Crowe may win the best actor Oscar."

","""A Beautiful Mind"" is one of those projects that would look like a hard sell to a producer upon close examination. Think about its premise: the story of the co-recipient of the Nobel prize for economics in 1994, a mathematical genius who was nearly overlooked because he was a paranoid schizophrenic. There is no doubt that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe's involvement was crucial to the film's coming to pass, but before one frame was shot, someone had to say ""yes."" Sylvia Nasar, upon whose novel the screenplay is based, must have been as surprised as anyone when producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard came calling. <br/><br/>This is the kind of story that wouldn't seem to lend itself to film narrative-it may not have had it not been for Akiva Goldsman and Howard's approach to the material. They leave out details of John Nash's life, glamorize people and events, all in the name of creating the best film possible. The difficulty in adapting Nasar's novel was that so much of the story goes on in Nash's head. Goldsman's script is one of the best I've ever seen put to film. It's part human drama, part perception-tampering psychological thriller. Another challenge is Nash himself. By now it's well known that the man had an awful personality. Goldsman doesn't shy away from this, but turns it to the movie's advantage. Crowe's remarkable performance as Nash is heartbreaking. The man is obviously a very dedicated mathematician, with all these ideas, but doesn't have the disposition to get them across. He's his own worst enemy. <br/><br/>The actual love story between Nash and his wife is altered, again, for the purposes of making the Nash character at all likeable. Nash had a son with Eleanor Stier before he ever met Alicia Larde. He never married Eleanor, who reportedly wished he would, but married Alicia. She divorced him in 1963 but did keep him from returning to a mental institution and stood by him while he fought his mental illness. The two were re-married recently.<br/><br/>Any inaccuracies or liberties taken have been excused by phrases attached to ""Beautiful Mind"" such as inspired by' or based on.' This film has critics scoffing over the way it oversimplifies Nash's ordeal, and yet those same critics turn around and unanimously bestow it with Best Picture nominations and awards, Top Ten list entries, praise for Goldsman, Howard, Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly. They need to remember that if Howard and company were for some reason forced to depict the events of Nash's life more truthfully, ""Mind"" never would have been made or worse, it would have been an inferior film. The industry needs more pictures like this one. Not that anyone in Hollywood cares what critics think anyhow.<br/><br/>Look for ""A Beautiful Mind"" to earn Crowe his second straight Oscar. Wins for Connelly and Goldsman are also likely. A shame, though, that Roger Deakins has been getting such well-deserved attention for his cinematography on ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" his work on this film may be overlooked.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","A Beautiful Mind would have been flawless if not for one<br/><br/>inconsistenency: Russell Crowe's  accent -- which is straight out<br/><br/>of the Mel Gibson School for Hunky Aussie Males Who Want to<br/><br/>Play Complex American Leads. To his credit, Crowe does pull off a<br/><br/>very complicated character -- but just barely. John Nash is U.S.<br/><br/>born and bred and never really strayed far from his W. Virginia<br/><br/>roots. So why did the filmmakers find it necessary to cast an<br/><br/>Australian lead? Yer guess is as g'das mine, mate. Granted,<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was awesome as the soft-spoken detective in L.A.<br/><br/>Confidential (keyword 'soft-spoken') and as the outspoken Roman<br/><br/>warrior in Gladiator, but as a complex leading man from a very<br/><br/>provincial area of the U.S., Crowe misses the mark at times.

","I am fascinated by the fact that so many brilliant minds are tormented with psychological disorders. It adds to the complexity and the mystery of the mind. The true story of John Nash is one of the best and most interesting examples of the troubled genius.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie is a hoax. From seeing the trailer I thought this movie was to be a bad romance mixed with a bad thriller. The trailer almost fooled me into not seeing the film, which proves to be the worst piece of marketing I have ever seen. This is neither a romance nor a thriller, and it is far from bad. A Beautiful Mind is a terrific drama about schizophrenia. It deals with psychology in a beautiful and original way.<br/><br/>
Russell Crowe did not deserve his Oscar for Gladiator last year. He does deserve it for A Beautiful Mind. I believe his achievement matches that of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest. He is quite frankly stunning, and plays on a tremendous variety in this film. Jennifer Connelly may very well win an Oscar too. The stunning beauty should have been an A-list actress at least ten years ago. Let's hope she is finally recognized.<br/><br/>If The Lord of Ring hype fails, I believe Moulin Rouge or A Beautiful Mind will take the Best Picture award in March.

","Mathematical genius John Nash (Russell Crowe) seemed to have all the skills he needed to succeed in life, without realizing he would suffer the unexplainable before actually seeing the rewards of that success.  A Beautiful Mind is a phenomenal movie about the unexpected turns our lives can sometimes take.  It's a story of a man any one of us would envy; living a life that would be our worst nightmare. Nash makes an astonishing discovery in graduate school and stand on the brink of distinction. Instead, the handsome and arrogant Nash finds himself on a painful and mind wrenching journey. After years of struggle, he triumphs over unimaginable odds and finally receives his acclaim late in life.<br/><br/>Supporting actors Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Adam Goldberg, Paul Bettany, and Jennifer Connelly provide Crowe with a stellar cast that adds depth to this movie that astonishes you and leaves you dumbfounded.  Words cannot properly describe this movie.  The acting is unparalleled.  I've never been much of a fan of Russell Crowe's, but I guarantee you that my respect for his acting has increased ten fold, if not more.  He gives the performance of his life.  He deserves all the recognitions and accolades the Academy or anyone else can give him.  Ron Howard, who directed the movie, has once again proven his talent in bringing to life the screenplay of Akiva Goldsman, based on the true-life story of Nobel Prize winner John Forbes Nash, Jr.<br/><br/>The film score will haunt you with its beauty.  James Horner, who produced the film score for Titanic, has once again hypnotized the audience with what is sure to be another Oscar-award winning soundtrack.<br/><br/>Giving this movie a perfect rating was not easy of me, but I couldn't in all honesty find any reason why not to.  The screenwriting, the music, the cinematography, the acting.it's all there and it's the best I've seen in a long time.  Normally you find a movie's virtues in parts.  One movie might have a great story but poor acting; another will have great acting but a poor script.  This movie will satisfy your appetite in a way no movie has recently.  I'm not by any means saying it is the best movie of all time. I'm merely saying it's the best movie I've seen in a while.  Watch, listen, and enjoy.let your senses, your mind, and your heart be delighted.<br/><br/>

Ask me if I've seen ""Grynch.""<br/><br/>With ""A Beautiful Mind,"" Howard proves himself to be, truly, at the top of his game.

The rest of the cast is pitch perfect.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amazing thing about A BEAUTIFUL MIND is how Ron Howard and DP Roger Deakins visually get across what it is to be schizophrenic -- a very real mental health issue that, to my knowledge, has never been examined so seriously in a film (sidenote:  though it's not mentioned in the film, Nash spent time at McLean Hospital near Boston, the same mental institution where Susanna Kaysen, author of ""Girl, Interrupted"", James Taylor, Ray Charles, and writer Sylvia Plath also spent time).<br/><br/>An uplifting film without being preachy, and a story people from all walks of life can identify with at many different levels -- a very rare Hollywood film indeed.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"Don Stephens","7","0","1","16 January 2002"," Press Return...
","Ron Howard's ""A Beautiful Mind"" is just the kind of movie Hollywood makes. An eccentric genius falls in love while battling his personal demons.  It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but I've seen it before, and in a better version.<br/><br/>Avid watchers of film will equate ""A Beautiful Mind"" with a little indie flick that came out in 1998 called ""Pi.""  (The actual title is the mathematical symbol.)  That film also depicts a mathematical genius, number theory stretching beyond his control, and the game Go.  But ""Pi"" itself was possessed of a spiraling madness.  A reclusive mathematician whose computer spits out a 237 digit number which could be translated through Hebrew into the name of God, and thus finding patterns in all the chaotic events of daily life.  It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, (who also directed ""Requiem For A Dream"" and is in talks to helm the ""Batman: Year One"" film) and was shot on grainy, 16mm black and white.  ""Pi"" had edge and daring and a lot of other stuff ""A Beautiful Mind"" doesn't have.<br/><br/>That being said, ""A Beautiful Mind."" is a lovely little film. A man's battle with himself, and a love story to boost ticket sales. It's one of those slivers of a true story that is mostly fiction but we all wish happened anyway.  Russell Crowe, in a brilliant performance, plays John Nash, a West Virginia math prodigy who can afford to be arrogant because he's always right.  The rest of the movie for the most part is nothing new, but the character of John Nash is something I don't remember seeing.  Mumbling in his near indecipherable accent, hobbling along as he ages, looking positively ill at ease in a tuxedo.  This is a new level of fearlessness for Crowe.  After a guy plays a disgraced-yet-studly Roman soldier in one of the most overrated films ever made, there is a level of coolness that one might feel the need to live up to.  Not Crowe.  He takes off his leather skirt and jumps right back into the deep characters where he left off with ""The Insider.""<br/><br/>As a director, Ron Howard is shamelessly commercial.  That's not always a bad thing, but it ain't always good either.  From his worst movies (""Dr. Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas"") to his best, (""Apollo 13"") Howard shows no artist's touch whatsoever.  My feeling is that he just falls ass-backwards into the scripts that'll probably be the highest grossers. Well, more power to him.  If he makes more movies like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" he may find himself with one more fan.  But pay Aronofsky some royalties, will ya?<br/><br/>*** out of 4"

"lhseaglerunner","8","0","1","10 January 2002"," `A Beautiful Mind' is a Moving Picture of Mental Illness
","`I don't like people much.they don't seem to like me either'-John Nash, `A Beautiful Mind'<br/><br/>
This single quote, which could sum up scores of main characters throughout the history of Hollywood, is perhaps the perfect way to sum up the attitude of `A Beautiful Mind's' protagonist, John Nash. Afflicted with a disease, schizophrenia, he manages to confront it and eventually conquer it on his journey through the highs and lows of life.<br/><br/>
We first meet John Nash (Russell Crowe) he comes across as an egotistical, yet brilliant mathematician, and because of his ego, he focuses his energies not on reviewing other ideas of his mathematical predecessors, but instead on finding `an original idea.' This quest poses problems for Nash as he struggles to find his idea, but throughout, he is supported be Charles (Paul Bettany), his partying prodigal roommate. When Nash finds his idea (of course he will-it's Hollywood), it is an economics that completely-and accurately, flies in the face of 150 years of economic theory.<br/><br/>
With this idea, Nash receives a cushy job as a member of an MIT think-tank that is funded by the government. It is he who gets the call to go in and break a nearly impossible Soviet cipher regarding agent movements. After rendering these services, he is called upon by Agent Parcher (Ed Harris) of the CIA to search for Soviet codes in magazines during the tense periods of the early 1950s. With all of this defense work, it becomes natural that he becomes a little paranoid and stressed, which only bring out schizophrenic delusions.<br/><br/>
To add to his already complicated life, the prickly and brusque Nash falls in love with a student of his, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who, despite his manner and direct approaches, loves him as well. To make a long story fit into the space of this little column; they fall in love and get married. But Alicia begins to get worried about her husband's paranoia. In the fall of 1956, Nash is taken, quite forcefully to a psychiatric hospital, where he learns that the world that he thought he knew was mostly in his imagination. Now Nash is forced to find some way to conquer his delusions in the tortured battleground of his mind.<br/><br/>
What can I say about this movie? Well, for the most obvious choice, it was nearly flawless. Russell Crowe is excellent in this turn from some of the more, shall we say, physical movie roles. With `Gladiator' on my list of favorite movies, I personally could not picture Crowe as an academic. I'll admit it, I was wrong. Director Ron Howard has made me say that I AM WRONG. That sounds humble enough, right? The supporting actors were also superb in their roles. Ed Harris was the perfect guy to place, with no offense intended, a jerk. He played out his character strongly and made certain that the audience would not love his character. Jennifer Connelly was stunning as she portrayed the loving, faithful, yet anguished wife of a man haunted by invisible demon. Awe-inspiring performances all around.<br/><br/>
The issues that `A Beautiful Mind' dealt with were also strong and daring. Thinking about all of the films that I know of, I can only think of a few that portray mental illness as part of a primal theme, with most of it showing the physical aspects such as autism in `Rainman' or the treatment of it, ala `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' This film delved into the invisible demons of schizophrenia, which were portrayed on the screen to give the movie some sense. But this is so much deeper than just the story of tragedy and triumph-it is really an allegory, a parable for living. Nash was forced to deal with his demons, to face them head on, which could also apply to anyone's and everyone's lives because as humans, we have fears and problems that should not be shirked from, but instead, be faced head-on so that the demons will be conquered. (Note to readers-If I have just gone off on a tangent, I apologize, too much studying of themes for Lit class I guess.)<br/><br/>
It is my prediction right here, right now, that `A Beautiful Mind' will garner a handful of nominations for the Oscars, and without knowing the rest of the field, I think that it should do very well. Go see this movie, it will touch you, it will move you, but most importantly, it will teach you about life and living. One hundred percent."

","I went and saw this film because what little I had heard or seen intrigued me.  This man, who saw everything in life a little different, was tormented down to his very soul by the part inside of him that seperated and made him the brilliant man he was.  Russell Crowe was able to lay every other character he's ever played aside (and even laid his own persona aside) to pick up and thereby bring life to John Forbes Nash Jr.  Crowe's Nash was multi-faceted, disturbed, genius, and passionate all rolled in to one brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Some have much to say for Mr. Crowe and the kind of man he is.  His award winning performance in Gladiator was exhilrating and he very much so deserved the Oscar.  (Although, I think we all could have done without the inflated ego after the fact.)  But as an aspiring dramatic actor, he deserves every vote of his nomination for his portrayal of Nash.<br/><br/>
Many of us are tormented by something in our minds and our lives.  Some by personal demons, some by chemical imbalance, and some just because of their creative genius.  As one who is daily tormented, I thank Crowe for being part of this masterpiece."

","I loved the biography written by Sylvia Nasar and I must say that the screenplay could have trusted the audience with more of the complex story written in this work. I liked the visual approach of the movie giving us an insight that was not available in the book, a novel perspective and an interesting solution, but I think that, as it was stated in the New York Times, the audience could have been trusted with the complexity of the situation. The portrayal of Nasar is so much more intense, and some much more realistic. I liked the movie, but would recommend that anybody who sees it read the real thing afterwards in a wonderfully written biography that shows you that life with a genious, with madness, with a mad academic world and in a paranoid era was very very far from the hollywood treatment of it. The acting by Crowe and the visual idea of getting us into that world was wonderful, but I hope that there is in the future more trust that an audience can deal with much more complexity.

"DrMoonlight","8","0","1","9 January 2002"," Honest and touching.
","I was a little skeptical when a friend recommended A Beautiful Mind to me.  My experience with Ron Howard's films has been less than delightful, and I was still angry at the dim-witted, wasteful Grinch released last year (especially when I learned that Dr. Seuss had refused every offer to let his stories be turned into live-action films). Thankfully, my friend's reccomendation was warranted, and I found this movie to be perhaps the most honest look at mental illness to come out of Hollywood in years.  I found this story especially touching because I recognized in Crowe's portrayal of Nash a strong resemblance to a very dear friend of mine, who posesses the same combination of psychotic tendencies and astronomical intelligence. Many film portrayals of mental illness show their characters essentially being cured of uncurable disorders.  Beautiful Mind shows a much bleaker reality.  Nash, like millions of others all over the world, can learn to adapt to some extent, but will live with his schizophrenia for the rest of his life.  As heartbreaking as Nash's story is, it is important to remember that among paranoid schizophrenics, he is relatively lucky to have companionship, employment, housing, and an intelligence that allows him to understand and fight his illness.  The vast majority of those with his disorder are homeless, friendless, and perpetually confused. But his fortune, for some reason, helps make him sympathetic to the audience, as  do a series of plot presentation devices which force the audience into his shoes in a way that very few movies have managed to do. Sadly, for all the strengths of this film (including an astonishing performance by Crowe), they are too often overshadowed by Howard's weaknesses as a director.  I was especially underwhelmed by his liberal use of Horner's mediocre soundtrack.  Many scenes would have been much stronger relying on the weight of the dialogue and the power of silence. The music was used in a way that was distracting and often made beautiful moments feel somehow manufactured and artificial. Beautiful Mind is, however, a beautiful film, and if you have someone in your life with a mental illness, you will find it particularly essential.  Even if you don't, this film is a powerful catalyst in helping us all understand"

","I hate to say it, but Ron Howard is nothing more than a glorified hack.  The man we remember fondly as ""Opie Taylor"" and ""Richie Cunningham"" has become the new King of Hollywood, churning out one populist hit after another.  But to take the harrowing story of John Nash and turn it into ""Good Will Hunting""/""Dead Poets Society"" mush is going too far.  Not only does Howard fool around with the facts to satisfy his crowd-pleasing neurosis, he saturates his film with a cliche-ridden musical score.  Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are solid, but their efforts aren't enough to give the film more bite.  This is a story about a very serious mental disorder, one that nearly ruined this man's life.  One wonders what a director such as David Lynch or Peter Jackson would've done with this material (think ""The Elephant Man"").  Nash deserves a darker, more complex take on his condition, not syrupy strings and cute little one-liners the audience can see coming a mile away.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

Just when I thought I had a handle on the plot and was convinced I knew exactly what was going to happen, reality would drop from beneath my feet. Nothing was given away.

","I have to agree with everyone else's comments about the acting in this movie.  Everyone was wonderful and utterly believable, especially Russell Crowe.  I am not usually a big fan of his (I thought Denzel Washington should have won the Oscar last year), but Mr. Crowe really hit one out of ballpark with this one.  He will definitely be nominated for his portrayal of John Nash.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie however were certain portions/segments of the movie that were just so ""unsubtle"" that I felt that we were being bashed over the head with the message -- such as ""love will conquer all"" or ""family really does matter.""  I rolled my eyes during a few shots/sequences, which, unfortunately, pulled me out of the ""world"" of the movie.  That being said, I thought it was an otherwise wonderful piece of storytelling, if a touch too Hollywood in wanting to spoonfeed the audience with some ""this is how you should be feeling/what you should be thinking of now"" shots or dialogue. I would have given this movie a 10 had they treated the audience as being just a little bit more intelligent."

Russell Crowe's performance is brilliant, as usual, giving us insights into a character that I believe no other actor today is capable of. It will be a crime if he does not receive an Oscar for this role just because he won one last year.  Ron Howard has crafted a film of such emotion and power, it will also be criminal if he does not receive the recognition he deserves at Oscar time.  Jennifer Connelly is fantastic, as are the other supporting characters.  My only complaint about the movie is the choice of Charlotte Church for the vocals on the soundtrack; I'm not sure what it is, maybe her voice is just too ""instrument-like,"" but I was very disappointed in her performance of the love theme, ""All Love Can Be.""  Her voice blends into the music to such an extent that I can't hear or remember all the words, even though I have seen the movie more than once and have listened to the soundtrack several times.  Someone whose voice stood out more from the accompanying music would have been better."

The movie would have been more complete if we knew why John Nash won a scholorship to Princeton, and more detail as to why he won the Nobel Prize. With that aside, however, this was an excellent film. The acting is superb and once you leave the theater, it makes for great conversation.

","A fantastic film with fine performances by all its actors, A Beautiful Mind keeps you both entertained and amazed by both the intricacies of the plot and the stellar performances of its actors.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe turns in a magnificent performance as John Nash, a mathematician with an amazing set of problems ( both in real life and mathematics ) that he is forced by circumstances to solve. <br/><br/>
While I am used to seeing stellar performances by Mr. Crowe, what I was amazed by was the absolutely stunning portrayal of Nash's wife by Jennifer Connelly.  While many have often stated that Ms. Connelly was talented beyond her previous screenwork, she proves that without doubt in this film. So often in the past Connelly has been used as a pair of breasts to be seen struggling against fabric or more often bared to titilate male viewers.

","A Beautiful Mind is satisfactory.  That is about the most soaring adjective I can come up with; in a better world, then, I would be damning the movie with faint praise, but in fact since most Hollywood movies these days are decidedly unsatisfactory you can take that as a recommendation, if not a wild one, that you fork over some of your hard-earned moolah and watch this flick.<br/><br/>It is a middle-of-the-road movie about a far-out topic; it is a meat-and-potatoes approach to a subject as delicate as sushi.  Certainly one would have enjoyed a more adventurous and transcendent approach to a movie about mathematicians, but at least ""A Beautiful Mind"" succeeds in its modest way at drawing us into a difficult and not-inherently-dramatic story.  The movie is leagues better than the edgier Pi (1998), which tried to illuminate math with an artsier touch.<br/><br/>I'll leave it to others to describe in detail the astonishing make-up and acting work that turns Russell Crowe, successfully, into a 70-year old man. <br/><br/>
A Beautiful Mind is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but in an era when most movies are painfully dull and vulgar, it is pleasing to sit in a theatre full of patrons enjoying the modest intellectual charms of this film."

The mind of Nobel laureate John Nash is the core of this biography.  From his early days at Princeton, where he tasted intellectual defeat early, to his triumph in Stockholm, Nash, as played beautifully by Russell Crowe, goes through intense combat with his psychological demons, including an apparent slip into schizophrenia.<br/><br/>`A Beautiful Mind' is the best exposition of the mind's ability to gyrate to a different tune since `Memento.' While the protagonist of the latter can't remember from one minute to the next, Nash is dangerously aware of every fantasy his mind can offer, including images of a flamboyant roommate, government operatives who may or may not exist, and a little girl who never grows old.<br/><br/>The tyranny of his mind's fantasies is not solvable by any mathematical equation. Its solution may be in the speech at the award ceremony, where he praises his wife for getting him there.<br/><br/>Crowe's performance will remind you of his mannered and suffering whistleblower in `The Insider.'

","I saw 'Beautiful Mind' because 'Vanilla Ice' was sold out. I had heard a great deal about this movie, and Russel Crowe's performance. So expectations were high. I had some idea about the story, and I know how hollywood deals with the real life stories of great/extraordinary personalities. And thats why I didn't like the first half of the film. It was so conventional, and Russel's character has been built up in such a stereotypical way. He's the typical absent minded, aloof but highly intelligent and witty mathematician, surrounded by equally talented but more worldy friends and foes. He lives in own world, and his fascination is breaking codes, playing with numbers. He jots down complex equations on the walls, on the window panes, anyplace you can think of. In one of the scenes he's show trying the formulate the pattern of pigeons' movement in the park! Balooni!! There's only so much I could take about his eccentricity. I mean c'mon, mathematicians and scientists normal people like you and me. I hate it when they try to create a larger than life picture of someone just to establish the story line. Instead they can show his actual contribution to the world of mathematics in general and economic in particular. But they assume that the person sitting in the audience lacks the intelligence to understand the technical stuff, so lets just simplify it for them by showing them wierd equation on the board and the walls and the window panes.<br/><br/>Anyway, so thats the first half of the film. Hollywoodization of the life and works of John Nash the mathematician. But all this changes in the second half when you realize that its not that this film is not just about the life of a great mathematician, but there's something more mysterious going one. I got hooked up into the movie only when it was revealed that Russel's character is a schizophrenic, and the movie gets better and better from this point. If only the story could have been told in a better way, like keeping the audience guessing from the first scene whether whatever John is going through is real or just his imagination, this could have been a much more engrossing film. This film could have been turned into a complex visual saga by going into Russel's imaginary world and the real world. Towards the end of the movie there are a few samplers of it, but not enough.<br/><br/>Russels Crowe's performance keeps improving throughout the course of the movie. In the beginning his actions look animated. At times he's confident, and at others he acts like a retarded fellow. Everybody else did a ok job, nothing noteworthy. Ed Harris's character hardly generates any impact. Ron Howard I believe makes movie which try to cross over from purely commercial arena to meaningful domain. Its very difficult to keep a balance, and thats why this movie lacks the punch."

","I'm known to give my personal opinions of movies to my friends and coworkers on a daily basis, with ""A Beautiful Mind"" being no exception. But with a film this affecting, I'm also drawn to share my thoughts with the members of the IMDb. Simply put, ""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film which extends far beyond the 2 hours and 8 minutes that you will spend viewing it in the theater. The characters continued to haunt me after the movie, thanks to the Oscar-inducing performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and all of the supporting players.  They are not merely acting, yet are transformed into the characters, leaving no trace of a line between their part and reality. Of course a film is only as good as a screenplay would allow, and the story contained within is written in a way that compliments everything that is truly great about ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Ron Howard can nearly be forgiven for his work on ""The Grinch"" for the inspiring work he has contributed to this film, and I hope that the critics remember him when awards are being given out.<br/><br/>I know that most reviews give you a synopsis of the film, revealing many of its major details to give you a picture of whether or not you would enjoy a film, but I've never been one to spoil movies with plot details.  I can only tell you that if you're looking for an emotionally-charged movie with near perfect acting, cinematography, directing, editing and a screenplay which will cause the story of John Nash to inspire you, then consider ""A Beautiful Mind.""<br/><br/>In closing, if Crowe isn't awarded the Best Actor Oscar this year, then my faith in movies and its rewards system will be seriously tarnished."

"vsphil007a","Null","0","1","5 January 2002"," A Beautiful Mind, A Perfect Film
","The stifling back of well-deserved tears is the best way to applaud Ron Howard's `A Beautiful Mind,' a remarkably poignant and thrilling bio-pic about mathematician John Forbes Nash, Jr., played by Russell Crowe. The fact that this is the only 2001 release (limited engagements began December 21) I'd approve of winning the Best Picture Oscar is a testament to its power long after the credits roll. The Plot: Loosely based on Sylvia Nasar's biography, `Mind' prominently focuses on Nash's Princeton years, where this eager genius is hell bent on discovering a `truly original idea,' for only then will he be able to leap over the shoulders of giants his fellow colleagues insist on standing upon. The pursuit of this idea allows Nash to apply game theory to dating, in a clever scene which shows Nash and his cronies applying game theory to the world of relationships. His idea comes at a great price, for Nash's sole purpose of being, his mind, becomes his ultimate downfall. Delusions and schizophrenia set in upon receiving a job at the Pentagon, under the command of Ed Harris' William Parcher, a man whose existence is as questionable as Nash's sanity. Grounding him in reality is his wife, Alicia (the beautiful Jennifer Connelly), who loves her husband without the luxury of being guilt free. `Mind' pulls a `Fight Club-esque' twist, concerning the validity of Nash's life's work and the very problem no brain can solve: the human heart. The Good: Everything great and wonderful about film has blessed director Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the latter redeemed for his work on `Batman and Robin.' Both are at the top of their form, Howard's camera so tightly focused and Goldsman pen fueled by poetic prose any actor would be honored to recite. Such an honor is bestowed upon Crowe, who continues a great streak of roles that expand his stardom while fine-tuning his craft to perfection. (The `Gladiator' Oscar should be re-engraved for this role.) There is a moment in Crowe's performance where we see the actor overcome by the joy of his craft, unable to contain the happiness of having good material and the honor of serving it justly. The quality of the supporting players, Harris, Connelly, and Christopher Plummer all support, and never distract, from this film's forward, feel-good momentum, an accomplishment so rare that it begs to be experienced. The Bad: The last twenty minutes feel like the epilogue to `Mr. Holland's Opus,' with too obvious old-age makeup distracting from the film's narrative, which up until then has used its special effects as tools rather than distractions. The film's bitter-sweet ending, where Nash's last triumph, the Nobel Prize, is a bi-product of his defeats, both professional and personally. The dÃ©nouement provides the film's master stroke, quickly referencing a recurring plot point which sums up both Nash's and the audience's experience as unforgettable. There is a full-circle motif in `Mind,' something few films achieve and most movies just abuse. But the creative talents behind `Mind,' especially Crowe's passionately human portrayal, seem to have found a happy medium between sappy and brilliant, mind and heart, a medium the film's subject and audience still aspire for."

"Altaira","10","0","1","4 January 2002"," Wow.
","Let me tell you just how good ""A Beautiful Mind"" really is. I have a kidney disorder that makes it necessary for me to visit the restroom every hour. I was on the verge of exploding halfway through this movie and yet I didn't move for fear of missing even three minutes of this fascinating event. (As soon as the closing credits rolled, I ran.)<br/><br/> ""Mind's"" greatest achievement, in my humble opinion, is the way it makes schizophrenia accessible to sane people. The general public knows schizophrenics tend to talk to themselves, repeat certain actions and do things generally at odds with the norm. But why? It's nearly impossible for a sane individual to understand why this happens...and more importantly, what that feels like. Without this essential empathy, many people become frustrated with the mentally ill, asking why patients can't pull themselves together and just bear up. We express this same impatience with the criminally insane who act upon delusions with disastrous results. It is incomprehensible.<br/><br/> ""Mind"" does all it can to change that, and it succeeds. Unless you are familiar with John Nash's story, you probably won't guess he's schizophrenic until partway into the movie. He's eccentric, abrupt, and highly intelligent, but doesn't seem crazy. The reason: His delusions are as real as reality to Nash, and likewise, they are real to the audience. *(SPOILER)* I suspected the decoding fantasies weren't real, especially when Nash began postering the walls with newspaper clippings. But his fictictious roommate threw me---and there is the point. The audience is just as fooled by the delusion as Nash is, who cannot tell the difference between truth and delusion.<br/><br/> Incidentally, I came across a professional review that blasted ""Mind"" for including ""all that spying stuff that had nothing to do with Nash's work that was thrown in for Hollywood thrill."" I feel badly for that chap, since he missed the entire point of the film. But that just proves Ron Howard's genius in creating a picture of insanity indistinguishable from reality.<br/><br/> There are some truly shocking moments in ""Mind."" When Alicia finds her husband's secret cache of newspaper clippings behind their house, I was eerily reminded of Jack Nicholson's wife in ""The Shining"" discovering his endless, typewritten pages of the same phrase. The scene that follows, culminating with Nash's realization that his delusions are indeed a false reality is brilliant. In a moment, remembering ""Marcie,"" Nash has a flash of insight, and he finally accepts his illness--ironically, through his intellect.<br/><br/>When Nash imagines that someone is going to kill Alicia, he lunges at her--and only through his eyes do we see how a seemingly senseless actof violence is a gesture of love, filtered through the smog of delusion.<br/><br/> Now my take on the acting: Superb in every sense of the word.  Russell Crowe sure knows his trade. There's never any question about the authenticity of his character, although the accent wasn't consistant. Crowe doesn't rely on his elaborate makeup to age Nash---his walk, words, and voice do that elegantly in the movie's end. Crowe will probably get at least another Oscar nomination out of this one. Heck, he might even win it again.<br/><br/> Ed Harris is, as always, perfect. Harris continues to be one of my favorite actors, simply because he's flawless. With delusions like these, no wonder Nash was torn between treatment and ""spying.""<br/><br/> I hope people see this film. Not just because Russell Crowe is cute or because it's a Ron Howard piece, but because you will learn something important. You will learn why compassion is an absolute must when dealing with the mentally ill. You won't glare at the next person you see muttering to themself. And when someone you love is dealing with a disorder, be it schizophrenia or depression, you won't ask them to ""pull themself together."" You will understand why they need your love--because they are just as confused as you are."

","Walking out of the theater, I realize that my two friends did not know previous to seeing the movie that John Nash was indeed a real person, and didn't know that this movie we had just watched was not a work of fiction (at least, that it was not based on false events).  I ask myself:  What was keeping me going?  Was it the fact that I had previous knowledge that John Nash is a real human being, and that this movie I'm watching is his story? If this is true, then what did my two friends have to go on?  All 3 of us had equal reactions to the film (very good), yet went into viewing the movie with such completely different mindsets.  Explain!<br/><br/>The music for the film A Beautiful Mind is incredible.  It is a virtual composer's pencil outlining the emotional and psychological overtones of the film throughout.  Being a musician, my ears are primed, and I admittedly go into the theatre sometimes with my ears more open than my eyes.  Yet if we are to believe that the sub-conscious has any relevance at all in connecting with our conscious experiences as human beings, than you (and I) have to believe that James Horner (the composer) has not only successfully tapped into my two friends for 2 hours and 25 minutes and efficiently musicated their experience of this ""fictional"" work, but has created a film score that both compliments and adds to the experience of this awesome movie.  If there were ever a case where you wanted to tap into your sub-conscious, I would suggest walking into that theatre with your eyes peeled as well as your ears wide open."

Russell Crowe blew up with Gladiator and could have coasted on the fame but instead took this challenging role and much to his credit and my pleasure really dug deep for this film.

A story of love, genius, and madness, you are taken into a real life story of 'the brilliant John Forbes Nash', the famous mathematician. The set is Princeton University, and the story begins as John undergoes a mission to try and solve a mystery that has been on his mind forever. In solving and submitting it he is immediately set on 'the sailboat to fame' and later is recruited as a code-breaking spy by Ed Harris's character. In the process he is engaged in a relationship with his later to be wife played by Jennifer Connelly, but soon, John finds out that reality is indeed all in ""A beautiful mind"""

"lawprof","Null","0","2","8 January 2002"," Biography? History? Cinema Art Over All?
","The film industry's fascination with biographies, real, imagined or twisted goes way back.  Perhaps D.W. Griffith made the first important one when he created a silent-screen Abraham Lincoln generally unrecognizable to historians (his U.S. Grant is a funny caricature of a very able general, one of America's best).<br/><br/>Film depictions of dead individuals are different than those of living people or those associated with them.  It matters little if Salieri was trashed in ""Amadeus.""  Music lovers know his works as being very fine and uphold his character as unblemished by the taint of suspicion of poisoning Mozart.  Beethoven is a semi-buffoon in ""Immortal Beloved.""  No matter - every conductor programs his works with awesome regularity and often tedious results.<br/><br/>When it comes to the living, those involved in making a biopic must consider a number of issues, a libel action not being the least predictable.  On the theory that art transcends mundane reality we have been given ""Shine"" in which a brilliant Geoffrey Rush convincingly portrays a supposedly virtuosic but schizophrenic David Helfgott.  One hearing of the actual pianist's sad attempt at resurrecting his aborted career puts paid to that vision.<br/><br/>More controversially, ""Hilary and Jackie"" presented a version of reality by one part of the late cellist Jacqueline du Pre's family, a picture that included a claimed sexual relationship by the musician with her brother-in-law, apparently with the acquiescence or even encouragement of her sister.  A torrent of articles has been spawned by that movie and bitter partisans of both factions are angry.<br/><br/>What to make of ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Russell Crowe is brilliant, Jennifer Connelly even more so, Christopher Plummer is miscast as ""Dr. Rosen,"" a psychiatrist who projects a whiff of evil more real than Professor Nash's powerful hallucinatory helpmates and enemies. Ed Harris is perfect as a spectral government secret agent.  James Horner's score is workable and digital enhancement makes teen ingenue Charlotte Church's singing slightly ethereal.<br/><br/>The choices made by the director and script writers as to what to portray about this living, brilliant, erratic and certainly very complex man says more about them and film marketing than it does about their protagonist. That he and his wife were separated for very many years is omitted as is the apparently verified reality that he was bisexual.  It seems that being gay is ""in"" these days in Hollywood while being attracted to both genders is not.  Mc Connell as the wife is unbelievably loyal.  Perhaps my somewhat biased perspective as a lawyer allows me to admire the performance while denying the possibility that her devotion could have been that intense. Well, of course, it wasn't.<br/><br/>Academy Award nominations are guaranteed for this well-crafted fable. Most schizophrenics aren't geniuses. Most people aren't either. Schizophrenia is eminently more treatable now than when Dr. Nash was at the nadir of his personal and professional life but his accommodation with his disease was then, and remains, extraordinary.<br/><br/>This film is high cinema art.  If Dr. Nash and his wife have no problem with how they're portrayed, neither should we."
"jhclues","10","0","2","8 January 2002"," A Beautiful Film
","As we go about our daily rituals and routines of living, in our own individual way, whether we are conscious of it or not, we are conforming to what we know to be the reality of our existence; a tangible, substantive reality we recognize, understand and trust.  And our senses provide the proof of that reality.  If we can see it, we can believe it-- which we do, and with good reason.  It's real.  But then again, what is `real' to one person isn't necessarily real to another, because there are instances in which an individual's `reality' exists only within the boundaries of his own mind, in a shadowland not unlike what many would think of as the Twilight Zone.  Only this place is not the creation of Rod Serling, but a very real place which exists-- with parameters set according to the individual-- within the mind of a schizophrenic.  And it is to that place that director Ron Howard takes us in `A Beautiful Mind,' starring Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>	Crowe plays John Nash, a mathematical genius, who since the late forties has left his mark on such prestigious bastions of knowledge as MIT and Princeton, and whose `Equilibrium n-tuple' is perhaps the most important idea in noncooperative game theory ever conceived; equilibrium strategies being the things we predict about people.  It's not been an easy road for Nash, however.  As he himself puts it, he doesn't like people much; nor do they, in general, like him.  And it's made constructive social interaction something of a problem for him throughout his life.  Beginning as early as his student days at Princeton, he was noticeably `different,' not only in his relationships with others, but in the way he conducted his academic pursuits.  Even within his small group of friends-- fellow students-- he is a challenge.  He seems able to open up only to a select few:  His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), being the first and foremost, and later the somewhat mysterious Government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris), whom Nash first encounters while involved in a project at the Pentagon, and eventually one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Nevertheless, his future is filled with promise, but in the early Â‘50s, while doing some covert work for Parcher, the mental illness which will devastate his life becomes apparent, and his life takes an unexpected turn into that shadowland that will test the loyalty of even those who love him the most.<br/><br/>	One of the reasons for Ron Howard's success as a director is that he understands human nature and has the ability to convey his insights to his audience.  He knows how to express the inner-most feelings of his characters in a way in which the viewer will be able to identify and relate.  And this film is no exception.  In bringing John Nash's story to the screen, he concentrates on the man, rather than the illness, and it's that which makes this such riveting drama.  While we get a glimpse of the physical horrors of schizophrenia, it's in witnessing the devastating and debilitating effects of it on Nash and those close to him that makes the film so emotionally involving.  Howard seems to be saying, this is a man's `life' we're dealing with, not just an academic case study; it's the humanity of the story that's important-- and that's exactly what he delivers.  He tells the story in a way that allows the viewer to empathize with Nash, as well as those around him, and he makes Nash a sympathetic character without resorting to any mawkish sentimentality.  Howard gives you Nash as he is, an individual of extraordinary ability, with achievements and problems to match, and presented within a framework that is very real and entirely effective.<br/><br/>	As Nash, Russell Crowe once again demonstrates that he is so much more than just a celebrity or a `movie star,' but an actor in the truest and purest sense of the word.  When you can watch an actor doing a part and completely forget that what you're watching is a performance, you know the work is exceptional, which is exactly what Crowe is here.  The story follows Nash through a span of close to fifty years, and the aging process is presented seamlessly by Crowe, who takes his character from youth to old age quite naturally and so subtly, that as you're watching you don't even give it a thought until, at the end, you suddenly realize that you've just experienced a man's entire life.  Howard and some outstanding makeup work must take some of the credit, of course, but beyond that it's Crowe who sells it, who makes it so real and brings Nash so credibly to life.  It's a performance that has Oscar written all over it, and deservedly so.  <br/><br/>	After a string of outstanding performances in a number of films (like `Requiem For A Dream' and `Waking the Dead'), Jennifer Connelly should finally receive some of the acclaim she is due with her portrayal of Alicia. Early in the film she effectively plays to her natural, dark beauty, but this is decidedly not a glamorous role, and as the story progresses Connelly successfully manages a much deeper expression of who her character really is and what she is made of.  It's an emotionally challenging role, and she certainly rises to the occasion.  And, like Crowe, she develops her character quite naturally, not only physically, but through a maturity of manner and perspective, as well.  It's a good piece of work, and if justice prevails she will receive the notice she deserves for it, because it's definitely one of the many strengths of the film.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (Dr. Rosen), Adam Goldberg (Sol), Vivien Cardone (Marcee), Judd Hirsch (Helinger) and Josh Lucas (Hansen) .  Thought provoking and emotionally stirring, `A Beautiful Mind' is, in the final analysis, a beautiful film, rich in it's humanity, and a journey that should not be missed.  I rate it 10/10."

","I don't expect much from Ron Howard these days.  I don't expect much from Russell Crowe either.  But this is a combination that just seemed to make magic.  I have given Crowe credit for his role in The Insider, but his role in Gladiator was not deserving of the Best Actor Oscar.  It was uninspiring garbage and it did not fit him.  Crowe has since redeemed himself with his role of genius John Nash.  About a year back, I picked up the book A Beautiful Mind and thought that this was one of the greatest stories ever told.  When the film was put into production, I felt cheated that a man like Russell Crowe was set to play Nash.  I was wrong.  Crowe grabbed this role and played it to the bone.  His character development throughout the movie was awe inspiring.<br/><br/>I don't like Ron Howard.  He is generally out to make a blockbuster picture and it kills me.  Why?  Because he has talent.  Even though he was on Happy Days, he has grown into a very controlling director.  This man wasted his talents with The Grinch and A Beautiful Mind has brought back the visionary mind that I saw in Apollo 13.  This is simply his best work.<br/><br/>The book had it all.

","MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Being an aspiring scientist myself, I was really looking forward to the story of John Nash, the schizophrenic mathematician who wins the nobel prize. From an objective standpoint, I could say that the movie was really good. But, from my personal standpoint, I was a little disappointed. John Forbes Nash (Russell Crowe) is a new graduate student at Harvard University. From the very start he has no friends (all his classmates accurately think of him as an a**hole), and he seems to have no chance of ever getting a girlfriend (his idea of wooing a girl being ""can we just skip the small talk and have sex, because that's all I'm interested in""). But that doesn't bother Nash. He doesn't like anybody but his new roommate Charles (Paul Bettany) anyway. All Nash really wants to do is come up with an incredibly original idea in the world of mathematics. His incredibly original idea does come out, shaking the grounds of things that were held true before hand.<br/><br/>After graduating, Nash is asked to stay at Harvard and teach.  He is even summoned to the Pentagon to crack a mysterious code that Russians are sending to each other. It is after this visit to the Pentagon that two things happen. First, he falls in love with one of his students, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). Surprisingly, she can handle his buttheaded personality, and his bluntness. She even loves him too. Second, William Parcher (Ed Harris), a secret government agent, has asked him for help in cracking more codes for the government. Nash learns that the Russians plan to drop an atomic bomb in a largely populated civilian area. Parcher asks that Nash read every American magazine published, in the hopes of finding some hidden code, which will put a stop to the Russians' plans.<br/><br/>Now Nash leads an exciting life. He has friends, he has a dangerous and exciting job, and he now has a family. But not everything is as it seems to be. After all, John Nash suffers from schizophrenia, and Nash can't tell the difference between his delusions and his real life. Neither can we.<br/><br/>I guess I've never been a huge fan of dramas. For me, there just wasn't quite enough to keep my attention until Nash's illness comes out. Then it is quite shocking, and the story is very intriguing. Russell Crowe did a wonderful job, balancing between a genius man and a crazed man, all the while being likeable, even when acting like a jerk. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as Nash's wife, not quite sure how to cope with her husband's illness. My favorite performance would have to be Paul Bettany's though. The first movie I saw him in was A Knight's Tale. A movie I loathed, except for him. He has some truly great talent.<br/><br/>I was also a little disappointed with the mathematical aspect of the movie. For me, I never really understood why he won the nobel prize. I wish that they would have gone more into his works as a scientist. But, I know that is not what the movie was supposed to be about, and I only want it there because I am a budding scientist.<br/><br/>Overall many great performances, and an interesting storyline will give this movie high marks. But I think the lack of passion, excitement, and detail will keep it from being a great movie in my eyes."

","When I went to this advance screening of A Beautiful Mind I expected a strong film due to Ron Howard and Russell Crowe being associated to this movie.  My expectations were high and they were more than met, the preview for this film is kind of misleading there is really a strong story at the heart of this film.  It's not like a biography of John Nash it is merely based around some events that took place in Nash's life.  I predict that this film will grad a best picture, best director, best actor, and best supporting actress nomination when the academy awards nominees are announced in february.  The same way that other recent movies have had success by helping the viewer to escape this film helps you to escape but into a more realitic setting.  Crowe's performance could actually win him another oscar I know it's hard to win back to back but his performance is really THAT impressive.  But what really holds the film together is Jennifer Connelly who stole every scene she was in, in the harsh independent film Requiem for a Dream.  Connelly is the balance to the film because it's hard for the viewer to always understand Crowe's Nash.  Connelly gives the same kind of supporting balance to the film as Marcia Gay HArden gave last year in Pollock.  A Beautiful Mind will be remembered as the film where even Crowe's harshest critics will have to admit that the he's talented."
