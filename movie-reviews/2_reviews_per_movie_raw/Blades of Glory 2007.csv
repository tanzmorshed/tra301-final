"snow0r","8","150","247","12 April 2007"," Fantastically Overblown
","Blades of Glory is the story of Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrel) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder), two rival ice skaters banned from competition after a podium brawl at an ""Olympic"" event. After Jimmy's stalker finds a loophole in the rulebook (yes, you read that right), the pair join forces to reclaim their rightful position at the top of the skating rankings.<br/><br/>While it follows the predictable rise, fall, and rise again pattern of most comedies, Blades of Glory is different enough to be memorable. The costumes are ridiculous, the set-pieces are brilliant (including a very awkward chase sequence involving a crossbow and an unfortunate mascot), and the performances, what these films hinge on, are excellent.<br/><br/>The Ferrel-Heder exchanges are drenched with homoeroticism, and their struggles to come to terms with each other's lifestyles (Ferrel: ""I'm a sex addict. It's my cross to bear"" and Heder: ""If you can dream it, you can do it!"") are funny enough to carry the film for large sections. The supporting performances of the Waldenbergs (Will Arnett, Amy Poelher, and Jenna Fischer) fill in the gaps successfully, their conversations charged with an unusual mix of villainy and incestuous desire. Then of course there are the skating scenes, which are quite a sight to behold, in all their spandex-and-diamonds splendour.<br/><br/>Overall, Blades of Glory is hilarious. Pretty much every aspect of it is fantastically overblown, and it keeps you laughing quite steadily for its 90-minute running time. Boom!"
"atliel","8","200","363","15 March 2007"," I'm happy to say that it is VERY FUNNY
","When I first saw the trailer for this film I didn't think much of it. It looked as if it were just trying to cash in on the popularity of Will Ferrel after the success of Talladega Nights. Well, I was wrong, big time wrong. First off, almost every scene in this film is hilarious and the trailer does it no justice. Don't get me wrong, I love Will Ferrel films for the most part but this one looked like it would be an exception. Instead this film fits perfectly with my taste in comedies like Talladega Nights, Zoolander, Anchorman, Water Boy, Old School and Billy Madison. If you like these kinds of films you will love this film."
"kelandis","9","132","248","28 March 2007"," Funny and worth a watch
","I saw the press screening of Blades of Glory last night, and I have to say...I haven't laughed so much at a movie for quite some time. Jon Heder shines in his role and portrays a character that seems carefully written to avoid any similarities with Napoleon Dynamite; I was actually surprised that there weren't any references to ND (that I noticed), since there were a few Ferrell lines that reminded me of Anchorman (which was just fine!). Ferrell and Heder work wonderfully together; the ice skating scenes are pulled off very well; and, of course, there are tons of quotable lines. Overall, a funny, satisfying movie (especially if you're into ice skating or Anchorman/Talledega Nights-type humor)."
"revadirchy","8","90","178","31 March 2007"," Pleasantly surprise, solid comedy throughout the whole movie!
","I saw the preview several days ago and figured it was just another case of, ""put the funniest parts of the movie in the trailer to hook the public and then be disappointed later"", but I was surprised and the comedic cohesion between John H. and Will F.. The dialouge was some of the funniest I've heard in awhile and the physical comedy was timed perfectly. This is not just another mediocre performance from Heder and Will that we have grown accustomed to. This movie really delivers and there were plenty of great cameos. Including Jenna Fisher from the office and even Nancy Carrigan. If you truly have an eye for good comedy, they you'll love this movie. I think it was the best comedy I have seen in awhile."
"Bloomaholic","10","112","227","31 March 2007"," Wonderful Film! I Loved It!
","I saw this movie last night and I have to say that I was impressed. I went with a friend to see this and I didn't think it would be that funny. The trailers were hilarious, but I thought they had used up all the funny jokes in the trailer and left nothing for the movie, boy was I wrong. If I went more than 5 minutes without laughing, there were very few times I did. <br/><br/>The story is quick and is fast paced, I was never once bored or wondering what time it was and when it was over, I wanted to go back and watch it again!<br/><br/>I have never been much of a Will Ferrel fan, but now I am, he was absolutely hilarious and it was a great match to put him with Jon Hede. They played off of each other wonderfully and just a random argument between them had you rolling on the floor with laughter. The movie stayed pretty fresh and I didn't feel like it was mindless humor and I even really felt for the characters. <br/><br/>It was a funny and interesting plot and unique and you couldn't really, entirely predict the ending, so it kept me guess. What was great,was that it started off really strong and ended strong as well and the ending left you pretty satisfied. For a comedy, it surpassed my expectations and I simply loved it! I recommend anyone and everyone to see this movie! I loved it!!! 5/5 stars!!"
"violentsociopath","7","88","177","30 March 2007"," Better than I expected
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie for two reasons: a) Heder hasn't done anything funny since Napoleon Dynamite and b) I thought Will Ferrel's shtick would start to run thin. Both actors played the type of character I expected from them. Heder gave something similar to the Napoleon Dynamite character and Will Ferrell was Will Ferrell. What I didn't expect was the humor. Ferrel carried the show and played the funniest character by far, but Heder didn't drag him down like I thought he would and the two worked well together. Heder was Jack Lemmon to Ferrell's Walter Matthau.<br/><br/>As far as the supporting cast, Poehler and Arnett were good as the Machiavellian doubles team that are the skating rivals to Ferrell and Heder's characters, but no one else really stood out. Jenna Fischer was lackluster as Heder's love interest and Craig T. Nelson did not make for a funny or interesting character either. Two people I thought would have been able to shine in larger roles were Andy Richter and Rob Corddry. Both are funny guys, much funnier than Nelson or Malco, and were underutilized in this film.<br/><br/>The humor was low brow to be sure, just like in every other project Ferrell does, but I happen to like that sort of humor, so I enjoyed it."
"Solipsisticblog","7","54","105","9 March 2007"," ""Blades"" is surprisingly funny
","Will Ferrell and John Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) as figure skating partners. Sounds like a bad SNL skit? Right? I wasn't expecting much from this comedy whose trailers looked dull and uninspired. It seemed sure to bore. So when I sat down in the theater, I went in prepared to hate this movie. But then the credits began to roll, I was pleasantly surprised by the roll of names: William Fichtner, Craig T. Nelson, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett (Gob on Arrested Development), Rob Corddry, Jenna Fischer (The Office), and Romany Malco (The 40 Year Old Virgin). So I knew that even if the movie stunk, it would be fun to see the actors together on the screen. Also surprising was to see that Busy Philipps (Freaks and Geeks) had a role in creating the story.<br/><br/>The story is simple: arch rivals Chazz (Will Ferrell) and Jimmy (Jon Heder) are forced to become figure skating partners after they are banned from competing in singles skating. With the help of their coach Craig T. Nelson--in David Carradine mode--the men try to put aside their differences and compete for gold.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell does another variation on his Ron Burgundy/Ricky Bobby character: clueless egotist full of machismo. But he does it incredibly well and this time adds the wrinkle of being an insatiable sex addict. Not surprisingly, he gets the movie's biggest laughs and successfully carries the movie. Jon Heder is okay. He doesn't get in the way of Ferrell and surprisingly, given his monotone acting, scores a few laughs as a cherubic man-child. Amy Poehler and Will Arnett compliment the movie well with their absurd comic turns as brother and sister skating partners and arch-enemies to Chazz and Jimmy.<br/><br/>The film has a surprisingly light touch and at times feels like a live action feel gooder from Disney. But Ferrell as sex-addled Chazz dispels any notion that Blades is family fare.<br/><br/>The movie is instantly disposable, but very funny. Audiences are gonna enjoy this one."
"IOBdennis","1","26","47","6 September 2007"," Sophomoric clap-trap
","Did I remember to laugh during this stupidly inane piece of trash? I don't think so! Nothing, absolutely NOTHING was funny. It was so inanely stupid that it was downright insulting. Here's the basic premise of the film: how many ways can you make homophobic jokes? Let's have them grimace at touching hands. Let's invert them so they have each other's crotches in their faces. And make sure that at every possibility, Will Farrell indicates his displeasure and disgust at homoerotic overtones with the same weary expression. It's almost as if the actor himself was saying: ""Here we go again. I have to register displeasure."" Lame! A terribly poor excuse for a movie."
"Rogue-32","8","72","152","6 April 2007"," This film actually warrants a sequel!
","From the very first second I laid eyes on the absolutely hilarious poster for this film, in my neighborhood multiplex a few months ago, I knew with extreme certainty that I'd be seeing it the very first week it opened. Caught it on Wednesday and I'm here to say the movie most definitely delivers on the promise of the poster, big time.<br/><br/>Jon Heder finally gets a role he can have some fun with for a change (which hasn't really happened since Napoleon Dynamite), and he's superbly cast as the sheltered and phobic Jimmy MacElroy, the perfect foil for Ferrell's sex machine on skates, Chazz Michael Michaels. Ferrell is fast becoming more and more adept at portraying genuine characters in his movies, not merely hollow caricatures, and he is clearly in his element here.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie, the set-up, is wonderfully written, and the over-the-top tone that's established in these opening scenes is successfully carried throughout. The energy level stays high, the plot never gets tedious or bogged down, and, best of all, the routines that the two of them perform together as partners are truly hilarious and original. I was left wanting more, and that speaks volumes."
"tajna_rabota","8","69","147","1 April 2007"," Classic Farrell and Heder - which actually works out really well!
","What can I say? The whole theater laughed during this whole movie. There were a few cheap laughs and some very obvious jokes thrown in, but the delivery was par for the course as far as Farrell is concerned. In other words, if Farrell is your kind of comedic character, you'll love this movie. If, say, Hugh Grant is your idea of a comic character, you'll probably hate this movie. Will Farrell's character was essentially Ron Burgundy on ice skates, which is a great idea. Ron Burgundy was, of course, the embodiment of the so-called ""alpha-masculine"" persona of the '70s and '80s. - unabashedly proud, sexist, and narcissistic. Put him into a sport that in many peoples' eyes in inherently effeminate and you've got a sure-fire crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Jon Heder was a little less Napolean Dynamite-ish in this movie. He is still the same innocent, ignorant, nerdy, awkward person as in his debut character. That said, he is a little more image-aware in this character, and as the movie progressed I saw less Napolean Dynamite (a major problem in his career until now, IMO), and I saw more of this ""other"" character. Heder's character is hard to describe other than to say it is Napolean Dynamite combined with Derek Zoolander - a lovable ignorant narcissist. Put that on ice skates opposite Ron Burgundy the figure skater and you have 93 minutes of great fun.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work is Farrell's willingness to do anything in a movie and Heder's reluctance to do such things. They are polar opposites as far as comedic actors and their comedic emphasis are concerned. But those two personalities really work well to complement each other on screen in this film. 8/10"
"khuniak","5","13","22","19 April 2007"," not as funny as i thought it would be :(
","Well a pretty cliché movie, was really looking forward to watching it and felt totally let down by ferrel. His acting seemed sub par and to be honest the whole movie just felt totally wrong.<br/><br/>The movie was very cliché, much of it seemed ripped straight from the movie ""Zoolander"" now that is a funny movie. Don't get me wrong there are a few really funny scenes and many that will make you cringe but overall the was for me below average and didn't quite pull it off.<br/><br/>This movie just seemed like ferrel tried to hard, and the entire movie seemed like he was trying to boost his own ego. My only recommendation is to wait for this movie to come out as a rental and save yourself some money."
"MVBarra1","9","66","144","30 March 2007"," Will Ferrell does not Disappoint!!
","This movie is a must see. If you enjoy Ferrell you will love this film. It is just a feel good laugh out loud comedy. There is not a bad performance in the movie. I didn't care for the Hector (Nick Swardson) story line. It was mildly funny in a sort of creepy/annoying way. That is the only blemish on this hilarious movie though. Ferrell and Heder play very well off each other. I am glad to see Heder play something a little different then Dynamite. Yes he sounds very similar but thats his voice. Poehler and Arnett make a great pair that you love to hate. Its great to see Craig T. Nelson doing what he does best, playing a coach. The end of this film rides the line of being either so stupid or comic genius, For my money its GENIUS!! <br/><br/>This film is a must see. Especially if you are a Ferrell fan. It is great.

I'd rather watch all the really funny, creative stuff that regular people are putting up on youtube.

Reading all these glowing reviews about a crappy movie like this is like listening to someone raving about a gourmet dining experience at McDonalds. Make your own entertainment. Boycott Hollywood!

"sonydude32","2","25","50","15 April 2007"," ""What the f**k was that?!""
","The summary perfectly sums up my thoughts about this sub-par comedy, which is more idiotic than hilarious.<br/><br/>There were some moments in the film that warranted a light chuckle. For the most part, however, the ""humor"" was largely unremarkable and relied more on shock factor than anything really smart and witty. Now, there's nothing wrong with shock factor in comedic context, but you can't rely on it virtually all the time as it seemed to have been done with this picture.<br/><br/>Couple this with the ridiculously overblown finale involving rockets (I won't go any further if you actually want to see this film) and it all makes for a film that ended up not being real satisfying nor truly amusing.<br/><br/>Getting up to leave the theater, all I could mutter was ""what the f**k was that?!"" Whatever happened to razor-sharp wit and believable situations in comedies these days?"

"Puritan77","1","30","62","10 April 2007"," How hard can acting be?
","Two skaters, Two bad actors, and 1 terrible script = Blades Of Glory. I have thought a LOT of times when I see a terrible movie, that it is definitely the worst movie ever made...well, after watching this, I now have a new #1. Will Ferrell's character does something out of the ordinary in this film, he likes to get drunk...wow who would have thought? Chazz Michael Michaels???, wow I'm thinking Will Ferrell came up with that all by himself. Everything he said was pure idiocy and far from funny, same goes for Heder. John, listen man, YOU ARE NOT FUNNY! <br/><br/>Most of the people in the theater left before it was half over, leaving only a handful of people who were mostly sleeping or passed out from boredom. I fell asleep once and had a nightmare that someone was throwing shards of glass in my eyes, then I woke up and the movie was still going, then I silently started weeping to myself because it wasn't a nightmare at all, it was a comforting dream, the real nightmare was on the screen in front of us. I don't see how people involved in something like this can make large amounts of cash, and just like this movie, it's pointless. To save everyone time and money DON'T SEE THIS! Or, you can have the same affect at home like you just watched it. <br/><br/>Go to the corner and stare at the wall for 2 hours, then take $10 out of your wallet and use it for toilet paper."
"dirkwildenborg","1","27","55","2 May 2007"," This year's worst movie so far
","First let me get this straight: This production has nothing to do with art. It is about moneymaking and moneymaking only. <br/><br/>There are no clever jokes here; this movie's definition of fun resembles the word ""straight"" in the first line I wrote being torn out of context and used in a practical situation. Every supposed laugh is based on clichéd gagging and tired stereotypes. This movie even bypasses logic, when needed, to give way to these ""jokes"". Some kind of ""sex addict"" (I didn't make that up; the movie actually makes use of this given) who can skate with the best but is at the same time dramatically out of shape? Sounds awesome!<br/><br/>Also, how exactly is it ""funny"" that a guy like him skates the way he does? Where does it make sense that in figure skating, a macho with sex appeal but without any skating techniques wins prizes? <br/><br/>The movie spends no time on character development, except for the hideous scene where the awesome sex addict explains how he got his tattoos - this of course will turn out to score high numbers on the scale of all-time idiocy. It also flat out screams 'homophobic'. The antagonists (stereotyped gayish brother and sister, where everything gay = evil/bad/unworthy of success and needs to be defeated...) are horrendously designed and perform miserably.<br/><br/>The plot is non-existent: two guys who can't stand each other (but can relate anyway due to one thing they have in common) end up doing two things:<br/><br/>-either liking or disliking the other -either winning or losing a final showdown<br/><br/>What ever will it be?! Can you stand the tension???<br/><br/>The script for this disaster is thus pure lameness and doesn't care about morale or reason. If I were gay, I'd feel insulted by this movie. If I were a figure skater, I would feel insulted by this movie. If I were Korean, I'd feel insulted. If I were human, I'd feel insulted. Oh.<br/><br/>I hate this production from the bottom of my heart. Just when I thought I knew what lame was, I saw this and wow, I didn't know lame looked like two idiots getting paid lots of money for pretending to be skaters and doing other dumb stuff nobody cares about? Thanks for pointing this out Will Ferell!<br/><br/>If you wanna see this kind of movie done right, go see ""Stuck on you"". It isn't perfect but it is fun and has class."
"editor-299","5","12","22","28 March 2007"," Ferrell hits the ice, but scores some laughs
","Will Ferrell's comedy efforts fall into two categories; he's a gentle, sweet, mousy, befuddled man-child (""Elf,"" ""Bewitched"" and, to a certain extent, ""Kicking & Screaming""), or he's a loud, drunken, usually half-naked idiotic lout (""Old School,"" ""Anchorman,"" ""Taladega Nights"").<br/><br/>His newest film, ""Blades of Glory"" (a takeoff on the ripe-for-parody world of competitive figure skating), falls firmly into that second category. Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, a self-confessed sex addict (""I'm attracted to women,"" he flatly states to counselor Luke Wilson), who is also skating's resident bad boy rebel. <br/><br/>Inebriated, cocky, unshaven and wild, Chazz makes women swoon and somehow convinces enough judges that his eclectic routines are works of art. In the opening scene, he flaunts his sexuality on the ice the way John Travolta did on the dance floor (well, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit), but he does win the gold medal in a Stockholm competition. <br/><br/>But, just in case one thinks this film is just a tankful of Ferrell gas, there's another component  the kind and gentle Jimmy MacLeroy (Jon Heder, ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Benchwarmers,"" ""School For Scoundrels""), who was adopted by a ruthless billionaire (William Fitchner, ""Crash,"" ""The Longest Yard"") and turned into a skating Ivan Drago. <br/><br/>He, too earns enough points to claim a gold medal, but when the two are on the awards stand, they begin fighting, causing former ""Knightrider"" and ""St. Elsewhere"" veteran, William Daniels, to strip them of their medals and ban them from competing for life. <br/><br/>Fortunately, a weird stalker finds a loophole in the banishment  while they cannot skate individually, they may team up and compete as a pair. Thus, the premise of two males who hate each other dancing about the ice is born. Sports stations and newspapers cannot get enough, but the current pairs' darlings, brother and sister team, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and SNL's Amy Poehler), have no love for these rebels of the frozen rink, while undercutting their every move. <br/><br/>With disgraced and loopy coach, Craig T. Nelson (""Coach""), putting them through their montage workouts (including attempting to solve the potentially-fatal ""Iron Lotus""),this becomes very much like ""Dodgeball"" with the world championship coming down to these two teams.<br/><br/>And while this is certainly no sophisticated Cary Grant screwball comedy, or a classic Preston Sturges film, or even a Three Stooges laugh-fest, there are enough genuine giggles for me to give it my personal thumbs up. Most of the yucks clearly come from Ferrell's alcoholic stumblings, but Heder has a few nice scenes, too, mostly playing of his character's effeminacy. <br/><br/>Once again, my criteria for comedies is different than my scale for drama. Here, it's the laugh factor. ""Blades of Glory"" gets some cheap ones with some crude, sexual remarks and situations, but overall, fans of both Ferrell and Heder will no doubt enjoy this one.<br/><br/>Pleasantly surprising, however, was the small but sweet performance of Jimmy's love interest, Katie Van Waldenberg (Jenna Fischer, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" TV series, ""The Office""). She adds a new dimension to what could have been a throwaway role."

The worst thing as well is the fact that Will Farrell is a good actor and can be up with Stiller in the comedy film stakes and he's been given this kind of poor material.

It really astounds me and worries me that some 20% of people are giving this 10/10 for what is an appalling comedy... how can this compare to something like Dodgeball/Kingpin/Naked Gun etc etc?

"Buddy-51","6","5","9","7 October 2007"," moderately amusing dopey comedy
","In ""Blades of Glory,"" Will Ferrell and John Heder play two rival figure skaters, Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, who are permanently banned from the sport when their gold medal tie results in a fisticuffs melee on the arena ice. After the men go their separate ways for awhile, Jimmy learns of a loophole in the rules which would allow them to return to skating but only if they compete in the doubles category. Even though the two men hate each other with the heat of a thousand white-hot suns and they would be the first all-male duo in the history of competitive skating, Chazz and Jimmy agree to bury the hatchet and take a stab at mounting a comeback. The fact that the two of them are complete opposites in terms of demeanor and style - Jimmy is a cupie-faced innocent while Chazz is a swaggering macho man, both on the ice and off - only adds to the absurdity.<br/><br/>""Blades of Glory"" never aspires to be anything more than a dopey, crowd-pleasing, mainstream comedy, and, as such, it generally hits the mark. It's true that it runs out of comic steam from time to time and that it is more amusing when the two men are arch rivals than when they are the best of friends, but there are enough laughs to make the film decent fun for the not-too-critical viewer. Ferrell and Heder make an enjoyable comic team, while acting stalwart Craig T. Nelson provides just the right balance as their winning-obsessed coach. As the evil, self-absorbed sister-and-brother duo determined to sabotage the boys' chances, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, fine comic actors under most other circumstances, are burdened here with having to bring to life two overly broad stereotypes. Despite their talents, that effort ultimately exceeds their grasp.<br/><br/>Special note should be made of the amazing CGI work, without which this film could never have been made. Even though we know none of these actors could possibly be doing any of these skating moves in real life, we are thoroughly convinced of its verisimilitude for the duration of the film. And the movie does a nice job lampooning all the snazzy graphics, corny biographical features, and sappy, self-important commentary that have become a staple of modern TV sports programming."

And then something truly horrific happened, that truly horrific thing is simply called Bewitched. Despite being the best thing in a bad movie his career hit a stumble somewhat, he wasn't sure what comedies he should be in. He got a bit more on firm ground with Talladega Nights, but that didn't propel him to the extreme greatness I found him before Bewitched was made. With him also messing round with more serious roles in Stranger than Fiction I wondered if he could hit his stride once more. Well Blades of Glory sees him sprinting once more, its a shame then that no one else in the movie can keep up with him. You see while Blades of Glory is a very funny movie full of very funny ideas, its also a movie thats seriously lacking until the ending. The major problems are that the supporting cast are just way too forgettable. The main villains, while having amusing moments, aren't memorable, the coach is certainly no Patches O'Houlihan from Dodgeball, and the creepy stalker is so wasted an opportunity its almost pitiful. Jon Heder finally delivers a performance that is at least passable since Napoleon Dynamite, and as I've said Will Ferrel is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>So what goes wrong with Blades of Glory then? Mainlly its the hit/miss rate of comedy that affects it the most. The movie does have a lot of hits, and when it hits hard the movie is heading into Dodgeball greatness. The unfortunate thing is that for every hit you usually get a miss as well. And when the movie misses, it misses pretty badly. Thankfully the hit rate is still pretty good and the fact that these scenes are so damn funny you ignore the bad scenes makes it a still enjoyable experience. The supporting cast as I mentioned has problems as well. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler have the potential to be great villains, and the well staged finale sees them almost living up to their potential, but the fact that they're under-written and under-used is a big weakness. The central romance with Heder and Jenna Fischer is also a bit of a misstep as it never seems to be going anywhere and its not remotely believable.<br/><br/>Thankfully Blades of Glory has a superb finale that sees it at its comedic best. In fact had the entire movie had the wit and humour of the last twenty minutes then the film could easily be just as good as Dodgeball or Zoolander. The characters are also extremely likable, well the lead two are very likable at least. Heder makes his character interesting and still being reasonably funny, he at least tries to keep up with the comedic genius of Ferrel, he never reaches him but he has his moments when he almost does. Of course the genius behind it all is Ferrel, this might not be as good as his performances in Anchorman or Talladega Nights, but he's still clearly having a blast, and whenever he is either drunk or screaming you can't help but laugh like mad. But the scenes that truly show the comedic genius, have got to be the ice skating sequences, or at least any scene wearing ice skates (you'll know what I mean when you see it). Whenever the skates are on the movie excels, leading to the finale involving a routine to Queen's Flash Gordon. I was crying with laughter the minute I heard the song start.<br/><br/>Overall Blades of Glory is an entertaining movie that features great performances by Heder and Ferrel. Unfortunately it collapses under the weight of these two performers and nothing else can keep up with them. A great ending and some truly funny moments dotted around make it a movie well worth seeing. But don't expect anything amazing as it never reached Dodgeball territory."

","Just watched this and I must say this is terribly overrated. Everybody was saying this movie was SO HILARIOUS!! But damn, they sure was wrong. The humour was very low and I laughed probably 1 or 2 times. Even though the second half of the movie was much better than the beginning still it was terrible.<br/><br/>This movie does remind me of Zoolander. Both of them is about a sport/job that most men think is for females and gays. And most of the jokes was making fun of the occupations. In B.O.G. they made fun of the ""tricks"" while in Zoolander they made fun of the looks and the expressions.<br/><br/>But there was one BIG difference between B.O.G. and Zoolander. Zoolander was funny and interesting. Not to mention it was the original. And yes I know Will Ferrell was also on Zoolander.<br/><br/>And as you can see I gave this a 5/10 after all. Well the second part of the movie saved it from an even worse rating. If I was only going to rate the first part then that would be a 2/10.<br/><br/>Anybody who want to name some of the best jokes in this movie and what was so funny about them? Because I couldn't really find any great jokes. But I find lots of lame ""haha look how ricidolous he looks""-jokes."

"castizodelforo","5","3","5","2 September 2007"," Zoolander on Ice
","""Blades of Glory"" is a fairly entertaining comedy that uses the ""odd couple"" concept at its core. Will Ferrell, as usual, is the funniest member of the cast, basically carrying all the comedy bits by himself. The script is so ""run-of-the-mill"", it feels like you've seen this movie before. Actually, you have: it was called ""Zoolander"", and used male modeling instead of figure skating as its theme. I found the parallels between Blades of Glory and Zoolander uncanny.<br/><br/>Both movies use a couple of self-obsessed dorks who are at the top of their game in an activity with less-than-manly overtones (male modeling, figure skating). Check! <br/><br/>Add lots and lots of funny gay undertones, which drive the comedic aspects of the film. Check! <br/><br/>Our two likable dorks are bitter enemies that have to find a way to work together in order to get back on the game and defeat their enemies. Check! Also, at a point in the movie, these bitter enemies have to dance awkwardly in a showdown (the ""walk-off"" of Zoolander, and the initial skating competition in Blades of Glory). Check!<br/><br/>In both movies the characters are introduced by TV anchors, as part of a live broadcast. And one of the two main characters is a sex addict. Check!<br/><br/>In both movies our heroes save the day by performing an exercise or maneuver that everyone else claims is impossible to accomplish (""Blue Steel"" in Zoolander, ""Iron Lotus"" in Blades of Glory). Check!<br/><br/>Overall, ""Blades of Glory"" is an entertaining movie with some very funny moments, particularly those involving Ferrell. The script feels like something we have seen a dozen times (Dodgeball, Zoolander, School of Scoundrels, etc). Jon Heder's Napoleon act is starting to wear very thin, by the way. Overall, this film is the definition of a ""renter"", nothing more."
"JosephLee411","Null","3","5","7 April 2007"," Better than Talledega Nights, not as good as Anchorman
","Blades of Glory(2007)<br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell as Chazz Michael Michaels Jon Heder as Jimmy MacElroy Will Arnett as Stranz Van Waldenberg Amy Poehler as Fairchild Van Waldenberg Jenna Fischer as Katie Van Waldenberg Craig T Nelson as Coach(ha!)<br/><br/>Plot: Two rival skaters get into a fight and cause some mayhem, so they're banned from men's figure skating. A loophole shows that they can re-enter as a two-male tandem, but to win the gold medal, they have to go through the Waldenberg siblings.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is sort of a love him or hate him guy. While most people love the roles he's involved with, there are those who do not find him funny at all. The same can be said for Jon Heder. So putting them with a movie made a lot of sense, because lots of people love the both of them. I loved the idea, even if I'm not a huge Heder fan. Will Ferrell as a figure skater? I guarantee that's how the movie was pitched because that had me hooked.<br/><br/>Ferrell shined in his role(and not because of the shiny suit either), as he had lots of off-the-wall moments that are normally his style. His character was very Ron Burgundy-esquire which I guess says if it isn't broke don't fix it. He's funny again so it worked. The introspective videos shown about Chazz Michael Michaels were gold.(""Personal philosophy: Clothing optional."")<br/><br/>Jon Heder as is less annoying here, and actually kind of funny. Good casting as the ""pretty boy figure skater"". The rest of the cast does their jobs well, especially Will Arnett, who says some odd things and kept me laughing.(""Yeah, remember how they used to be alive?"") Also, we have a Craig T Nelson sighting, and I'm sure someone knew what they were doing casting him as a character known as ""Coach"".<br/><br/>This movie does tend to waver as there are some moments where it tries to be funny and falls on it's face. The entire chase scene between Arnett and Ferrell was funny in some parts, but dragged. The romance story that was thrown in felt forced. It didn't really have a place in this movie. This was more about Chazz and Jimmy, and when those two are on screen together(or when Poehler and Arnett share the screen) it works. When they're not, it doesn't. So the two rival teams do have a lot of chemistry. One could say they have way too much chemistry, but that adds to the comedy factor(You'll see.)<br/><br/>Blades of Glory is funnier than Talledega Nights, but never reaches the status of Anchorman. It's funny, but it's not consistently funny, and when it's not funny, it is actually kind of boring. If you want a good laugh, wait until DVD.<br/><br/>Rating: *** of *****"
"worldofjohnboy","6","3","5","2 April 2007"," It will make you laugh, but not continuously...
","Let me first state that I believe Ferrell is a comedic genius and have just about every single film of his (yes, even Bewitched).<br/><br/>I am very open-minded when it comes to comedies... I like simple comedies that make me occasionally laugh throughout as well as the slapstick, gut-wrenching ones that I never stop laughing at. I walked into the movie expecting the first kind, but hoping for the second... I got what I expected.<br/><br/>Ferrell and Heder worked very well together, the plot was well worked and there was the occasional scene that I turned to my friend and just burst out laughing at. Overall, I didn't laugh continuously like many people are saying they did. Don't get me wrong, this was a funny film, but those of you that are used to the Ferrell characters and films that make your belly hurt 30 minutes in may be a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>As far as films that feature Ferrell as the main character go, this ranks around the middle of the pack, hence the 6 of 10 stars. It's not as hilarious as Anchorman, Elf, or Old School, but is certainly as good if not better than Talledaga Nights, Bewitched, or Kicking and Screaming."

I went to see this with my parents, who are in their fifties, and they both thought it was a great, funny movie. There are a load of great comedy actors and actresses including a further showcase of the talents of Jon Heder. I was also glad to see Jenna Fischer from The Office in the movie. She does a great job as a supporting role. I would say this is worth seeing in theaters but would also be a great rent-and-take-home movie. Overall I'd give it a 7/10.

","I must say I didn't expect too much of this movie when I walked in; it just seemed like an okay way to spend a Monday afternoon. I was right. It was a good time waster, but not too much more than that. Will Ferrell seems to be getting more crude and less funny, and Jon Heder hit his peak with Napoleon Dynamite (his only funny moment in Blades of Glory was running ridiculously down a hotel hallway). I was expecting a little more out of Will Arnett and Amy Poehler, but they didn't give much.<br/><br/>Pretty much the same thing as the trailer, only dragged out 90 minutes longer. No surprises, unless you count the feeble attempt at a twist as one. But who expects a good plot when they see a movie like this? It was semi-enjoyable. A fun movie, but not funny (more jokes that didn't work than ones that did). But I found myself laughing a little anyway, just at its ridiculousness."
"Quinoa1984","7","4","8","1 April 2007"," a comedy working from used parts, never gets off the tracks of being just a ludicrously stupid farce
","Blades of Glory is in part a spoof on the trashy romantic ice-skating drama The Cutting Edge, only this time playing off more-so on the homosexual subtexts of men in ice skating and in the utter lack of shame in Will Ferrell. It also co-stars Jon Heder, but aside from one or two big moments (like his scene in the toilet stall, or in some of his happy-go-lucky bits of dialog) it's really Ferrell's show here as comic impresario. Somehow, Ferrell's shtick doesn't get too tiresome, at least just yet, because of how much effort he puts into being a stupid louse. But a stupid louse that has a level of intelligence, because as one could see from past Ferrell movies his level of comic timing, with the emphasis on the immature and the inane in verbal terms as well as on top of the physical stuff (just seeing his body is a crack-up, especially here with his multiple tattoos), it somehow works for the end goal of the filmmakers. There's so many goofy bits here that one may overlook how anything story-wise has been used more times than I'd care to think about with sports movies- which is part of the point of the lampooning.<br/><br/>Ferrell and Heder are competitive ice-skaters, banned due to a fight during their equal gold-medal awards, and only get back into the competitions by going as a duo, which raises some obvious eyebrows. Then there's the whole rift between the dastardly brother/sister team (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), the grueling training sessions where their trainer (an underrated comic actor in Craig T Nelson) prompts them on impossible North Korean skating moves of death, and a love interest in an assistant/sibling to the villains for Heder's character. Nothing to get excited about on that front, the actors then base everything for laughs on attitude (how the skaters do their ""acts"" during skating), facial expressions (Ferrell drunk during the kiddie ice-skating show), the go-for-broke gay jokes at the expense of the stars (an Aerosmith song has been rarely used to such an effect), and just other off-the-wall humor. It's all very obvious, but the wink and the nod doesn't disappoint. It might for some; by now Ferrell's been in more than one sport-spoof, and he's likely to be in more of them. But it also allows for him, as well as Heder and others, some ample comic opportunities. One of the funniest bits for my money is in a chase on skates between Arnet and Ferrell that leads them to the arena- but still on skates.<br/><br/>It's goofiness completely for the sake of the audience, and though it doesn't spark up really remarkable comedy moments like in Anchorman and Talladega Nights, it's good to take the edge off on a Sunday afternoon; it's the kind of comedy that will work best with a bunch of friends anticipating that within the PG-13 range anything goes."
"jocrane14","8","4","8","31 March 2007"," There is only one Will Ferrell
","I was totally shocked how much I enjoyed this movie. Is it dumb? Yes. Is it stupid? No doubt about it. Is it funny? YES. Will Ferrell carries the movie from start to finish. Doing his Neil Diamond routine from Saturday Night Live, Ferrell had me in stitches from the very start. Jon Heder is not funny and I really don't know why he was cast in this role, besides being as girlie as possible.<br/><br/>Will Arnet and Amy Pholer have a couple of funny parts and Jenna Fishcer from the Office, does do a whole lot besides look cute. Jim Lamply, also has a few laugh out loud moments. The skating routines done by the duet are probably the funniest scenes in the movie. But much like Anchorman, its dumb, it knows its dumb but somehow works.<br/><br/>So if you're a Will Ferrell fan, go see it. If you don't think he is funny, Don't go see it."

","First of all, a handful of questions......<br/><br/>What happened to subtle humor? Why do filmmakers like this think they have to kick you in the testicles to get a laugh, or is it just hilarious to them? Don't they ever have jokes that the audience has to use their brains to figure it out? Why does Hollywood put comedies down the gutter, film after film? Do they think ""sex"" is the only funny topic? <br/><br/>In this typical crude, obnoxious, sex-obsessed comedy of today's world, the topic is ice skating and, of course, a big plug (if you see it that way) for same-sex pairings., Actually, story-wise - the film is a rip-off of Zoolander and Dodgeball, which were much funnier films, by the way. In this one ""Chazz Michael Michaels""(Will Ferrell), a slob who proudly admits he's ""a sex addict,"" and ""Jimmy MacElroy"" (Jon Holder),a pretty-boy small blonde guy who looks more the like the real-life thing, are both are thrown out of competitive ice skating when Ferrell starts a fight on the ice.<br/><br/>Several years later, figure skating guru, ""Coach"" (John T.Neson) figures the boys could sneak back into competition by being pairs. Hey, whoever said you couldn't have two same-sex partners, he reasons? Of course, you know the guys will quickly evolve from stooges to champions.<br/><br/>Along the way you get the same old/same old bathroom jokes and sight gags in today's comedies, meaning nonstop sex jokes, guys with their faces in the other's crotches, guys with their skates and other objects rammed into their groins, nonstop innuendos or gross-out scenes and generally low-life material we've come to expect from a Will Ferrell film. As for Holder, this is the first time I've seen him since ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and he's okay. I don't think he'll win any acting awards but at least he's isn't anywhere as offensive as Ferrell.<br/><br/>Hey, I like dark humor. It can be very funny at times, but Ferrell's character overdoes it. Cut his crudeness and insults in half and you might have had a semi-decent movie. Yeah, I know the character he plays in here is supposed to be repulsive, but it's overplayed to the point of losing the humor.<br/><br/>Stereotypes? I won't even get into the gay issue with this movie. How about the villains with the big German names (Von Waldenberg)? How long is Hollywood going to hang onto its hatred of Germans? Get over it.<br/><br/>I was sorry to see real life skating star/announcer Scott Hamilton involved with sleaze like this. I thought he had more class. The same could be said for some famous other skaters of the past, but they only had cameo appearances.<br/><br/>Finally, in this sex-sleaze ""comedy,"" I see two of the writers were guys named Cox. That figures!"

Yet people still wet themselves laughing at the same one dimensional characters doing a stupid voice and talking the same crap.There is no talent in these movies.

","Personally, I thought this film was extremely well done. I know people are saying that it's just like Will Ferrell's other movies; but it really isn't. I mean his character is similar in ways to other characters of his but not completely the same. I thought Jon Heder did a really excellent job working off of Ferrell. I'm so glad that I'm getting to see Jon Heder in other film projects; but his character was just really funny and played well. Real life couple Amy Poehler and Will Arnett did excellent jobs as brother and sister. I had heard that there's little sexual moments between them and well there were probably about 1 or 2 of them and it kind of creeped me out but not way bad. Just when they kissed at the end really made me kinda nauseous but then I remembered that they're actually married in real life so in the end it didn't bother me. I would've liked to have seen Jenna Fischer have a bigger or different role. I mean I believe she did a really good job but it just wasn't a total breakout performance. But I did like her and Jon Heder's performance together, they worked well together. But I have to confess, being a huge fan of The Office it was really odd for me to be seeing Jenna kissing Jon when I'd rather be seeing her kiss John Krasinski who plays Jim on The Office. That would've made me really happy, ha-ha. All in all the movie was done well. I appreciated the very very small role that Andy Richter had in the film; he said very few lines but was funny to see him as a Canadian cop. I'd recommend seeing it, but maybe it's just me. I saw it with my mom and she said she had never heard me laugh so much at something. Also most of the other people who were there were laughing with me, it had a good turn-out for the first showing of the movie at my local theater. So if you're looking for a really funny movie, that won't really disgust you and is actually pretty clean, I would totally recommend Blades Of Glory."

","Will Ferrell has always been hit or miss for me. He's great in Stepbrothers and A Night At the Roxbury but just painfully bad in films like Get Hard. Luckily Blades of Glory is the perfect fit for him and he shines alongside Jon Heder in this ridiculous figure skating comedy.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a fictional figure skating culture where outrageous stars win the hearts of the audience with outlandish routines and acts. Will Ferrell plays the rock star figure skater who is forced to pair up with the classically trained Jon Heder in order to compete as the first ever male figure-skating pair after an incident forced them away from the singles scene. Opposite them is the sibling figure skate-match up of Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, each as funny and ridiculous as Ferrell and Heder. <br/><br/>Blades of Glory works because it revels in its made up figure skating culture and playing to the actors and themes strengths without going completely overboard. It's no comedy for the ages, but it is a comedy good for a lot of laughs."

But, LORD help me, he still makes me laugh anyway, in spite of myself. Lines like ""I see the Virgin Mary...No, that's not her!"" just crack me up. It probably means I need professional help, but since people are still paying to see these movies I guess I'm not alone.<br/><br/>Not one of the great pictures or funniest pictures of all time, but good for a chuckle, in spite of yourself, if you can overlook the third-grade humor and grossness from time to time.<br/><br/>It's Will Ferrell. Nuff said."
"blanche-2","8","2","3","25 November 2007"," Very funny, very silly
","I skip most current comedies because the humor is geared to the lowest common denominator, and I prefer the screwball comedies of the '30s and the more sophisticated comedies. So normally I wouldn't have seen ""Blades of Glory"" except that I am a figure skating fan. It's the story of two top American figure skaters, Chazz and Jimmy (played by Will Ferrell and John Heder), two bitter enemies, who, after a fight on the winners podium are stripped of their medals and banned from skating. Jimmy ends up working in a sports shoe store and Chazz wears a costume in a children's' skating shoe. Jimmy's stalker finds a notation in the rule book that indicates that he only can't re-enter the mens single competition. It says nothing about pairs. Unable to find a female partner, Jimmy's old coach hooks him up with the macho, drunken Chazz Michael Michaels, who was skating's bad boy.<br/><br/>This is a very funny film with good acting, good characterizations, amazing skating, and a lot of slapstick. Particularly if you're a figure skating fan and have followed it over the years, you will appreciate the enthusiasm and seriousness of the commentators, in particular, Scott Hamilton. I have no idea how he kept a straight face, but it made the film even funnier. The routines, the costumes - the whole parody of the skating world is perfect. I especially liked the Van Waldenbergs' irreverent routine based on the JFK-Marilyn Monroe romance, which begins with Kennedy saying ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" and has Marilyn, in her famous white dress with the halter top, popping pills and posing as she did over the street grate in ""The Seven Year Itch."" HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>The references to skating stars like Michelle Kwan, who supposedly wanted to marry the Will Ferrell character, Oksana Baiul (who is colder than dry ice? OKSANA) and Kristy Yamaguchi was especially appreciated, as was seeing Brian Boitano, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming and Nancy Kerrigan in the film.<br/><br/>It was one laugh out loud moment after another. Even if this type of movie with its sporadic vulgarity and sex jokes isn't for you, if you've been a fan of figure skating in the past 10 years and remember the Nancy-Tanya debacle, you will enjoy ""Blades of Glory."""
"omegaknight_d","10","2","3","1 April 2007"," Flash Ahhhh Ahhh!
","With out a doubt the most ridiculously funny cinematic spectacle I have seen in a theater. Heder and Ferrell excel at devoting wholly to the most moronic roles they can sink their meaty overbearing teeth into, specifically Heder on that one. From the costumes, to the skating, they handled the figure skating portions as if they were big fans. Great use of camera work, wire play and visual effects made the skating sequences breathtaking and gloriously over the top as well. As for the humor and dialog it is razor sharp and as silly as you can get. Here's an example:<br/><br/>(Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy walk into the Coach's home, he asks them to remove their shoes, so as not to damage the Berber carpeting.)<br/><br/>Chazz: Who's gonna be stepping in baby food?<br/><br/>Jimmy: It's Berber you idiot, it's carpeting.<br/><br/>Chazz: What are you some kind of carpet expert?<br/><br/>Jimmy: Yeah, maybe I am.<br/><br/>Chazz: Yeah, well Im the carpet master!<br/><br/>You will laugh, you will pee, you will be thrilled and you will roll down the aisles begging, pleading, dying for more.<br/><br/>It's an awesome display of cinematic comedy and if you don't think so I'll get inside your face and kick your ice!"

","I love this movie. I have seen it so many times I've lost count. Ridiculous, over the top, hilarious and heartwarming. Brilliant acting and chemistry from the leads and some hilarious one liners all add to the madness and fun. Okay, so the premise is not entirely original but the twist of it being on ice is a fun touch and some of the moves choreographed are epic. The lead males are so ridiculously opposed in personalities but the bond they form is very well carried out and plausible by the end. I recommend anyone who loves off the wall humour sees this, particularly any Ferrell fans out there. A lot of people say this movie is too dumb because the humour is too over the top to be taken seriously.. Yes- it IS tacky, cheesy, over the top in many parts- that's the point. It's supposed to be. Ironically,to those labelling this kind of comedy as suitable only for those with an IQ of zero.. If you can be smart enough in your wits grasp the deliberate nature of this type of humour, you will get it's appeal."

","This is the kind of silly comedy to be watched just to relax, and if you see it with your friends it will be funnier.

The skating scenes are the funniest. What I didn't like were the bad guys they could have been better and funnier.<br/><br/>Chazz and Jimmy are professional skaters who will have to be partners despite they don't get along so they can compete again after they were banned of competing individually, but they will have to beat the champions the Van Waldenberg (brother & sister) to get the glory again ........<br/><br/>If you like the Adam Sandler movies then this movie is for you otherwise avoid it."
"Karl Self","6","1","1","1 February 2009"," Blazing Blades!
","Strangely, professional ice skating is yet unmarked comedic territory -- or at least I can't think of another comedy that deals with it -- which Blades Of Glory boldly enters. Hollywood's top gauche actors, Will Ferrell (that burly one with the overly closely set eyes) and Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Heder (should consider closing his mouth once in a while and losing that perm) team up to reach for gold. For about one hour it's pretty solid, if predictable, comedy: Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) are top figure skating champions who lose their license for duking it out on the podium. After a while in the doldrums, they discover a legal loophole and storm back onto the ice as the world's first all-male pair skating team, only to face the world's most pernicious Teutonic siblings on skates ...<br/><br/>Amazingly, both Ferrell and Heder learned to skate well enough to blend in seamlessly with the SFX, which makes the figures look surprisingly authentic (no mean feat, and of the directors remarked quite believably that this movie was like a Waterworld on ice). It's mostly cheap but effective jibes against the colourful world of ice skating, where primadonnas perform amazing feats in glittery spandex (and that's just the men) -- and the references to Tonya Harding, Brian Boitano and Elvis Stojko come thick and fast. The movie is at its best when it just lets Will Ferrell rip -- such as in the Sex Addicts Anonymous scene. Will Ferrell might not be the comedian to impress your in-laws with, but he is like the Boris Spassky of silly fun. The movie runs out of steam and gags towards the end and can't escape predictability, but, hey, it's still good entertainment on a slow evening."

","Quite honestly I went to watch this movie without any prior expectation. My friends had taken all the good movies by that time and I was left with few seeming stupid movies. I picked it up randomly or pseudo-randomly [:)]. I didn't even check IMDb rating before watching. For the first 15 minutes I kinda felt wasting my time but later it became interesting. The fun actually started when Mckenroy and Michel were registered as a team. Their first performance was pretty good. And then it turns to good comedy. Sex addiction, horse shampoo, My Humps, sliding of Mackenroy with bare chest, holding Mackenroy up by his 'pinus', watching at each others too what wasn't there. If you are cynic person you may not like it, but if you don't worry about logic and looking for a pleasant time to have fun then I recommend this movie. This could be a family movie too if you trust your children with a little bit sex terms [;)]. Maybe this movie doesn't deserve any nomination of big awards but certainly you wouldn't regret if you watch this movie."

The only thing that stands out is the humor and more importantly the skating stunts. Applause for the efforts. Will is trying to be original and Jon is trying his best to fit in and both have done it well to some extent. The bitter part to swallow were the occasional exaggeration which were tasteless e.g the jet-type exit of the actors from the stadium at the end. The climax was delicately managed but this one ruined it. After all its the finishing touch that matters the most!!!!

","Some of these reviews are extremely harsh. Seems like some people don't realize this movie was a parody more or less. Like an extended comedy sketch. <br/><br/>It has some funny moments, but parodical or not, it's very predictable, and no matter what the script had in mind regarding this little 'problem', it just doesn't work that well. I don't know if this proves you need a good story for a movie, or if the humour doesn't make up for the lack of that but, I've seen better, for sure. As far as the Anchorman references go, I barely think it's comparable. Anchorman was more bizarre and frankly, less 'popcorn-friendly'. It was also clearly better."

","""Blades of Glory"" is about 2 ice skaters, Chas Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder), two former ex-rivals who decide to team up as a duo when they are banned from individual events. Their ban came from a punch up that occurred on a podium after a heated competition several years back. MacElroy gets the idea from a stalker (one of the better characters in the movie who was way underused). He approaches Michaels who baulks at first but soon realises it's a chance for him to hit the big time again.<br/><br/>Not Ferrell's best work, but some OK jokes. The humour is much more warped and abstract than his normal stuff and is consequently very hit and miss. Heder doesn't bring much to his role, maybe an Owen Wilson or such could have brought more to the role."

","I expected little from Blades of Glory, as I usually do when I see a comedy on DVD that I've never heard of. On the other hand, I live in central eastern China now and everything here is pirated, so it's no surprise that I know little about what is going on in American theaters. At first glance it seemed like an expected pairing of a hugely famous comedian, Will Farrell, with a new and inexplicably famous comedian (I'm sorry, Napoleon Dynamite just didn't do anything for me), riding on the wave of attention generated by his debut film. <br/><br/>The movie is better than I expected, but is still nothing more than your standard Saturday Night Live comedy, and even those are generally much better than this. Farrell and Heder play Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, two bitter figure skating rivals who can't stop acting like children, even when standing on the podium. The result is that they get into a fistfight after obtaining an unlikely tie in an important competition. They set the mascot on fire and everything. As is to be expected, they are booted out of professional competition forever. <br/><br/>MacElroy gets a lowly job fitting skates on bratty kids at a skating rink, never letting go of his tireless skating perfectionism, even when it gets him kicked off of the cushy skate-fitting job and back to the store-room or something. Michaels, on the other hand, continues to skate, although in the capacity of some goofy character in an ice-skating performance for children. His incredible amount of boozing and womanizing does two things, it makes me wish he didn't have my name twice in his name, and it ultimately gets him fired for puking in his costume during a performance. <br/><br/>After a few years, some nutjob stalker of MacElroy's (played by that guy who seems to like nutjob stalker roles) discovers a loophole in the rules. Michaels and MacElroy are banned from competition, but only SINGLES competition. They can still compete as a pair, which leads to all sorts of low-brow hilarity. Both main characters are goofy caricatures, even goofier than you might expect, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. But in general it's entertaining enough, the production values are impressive. I've seen better but this is not a bad way to spend an hour and a half..."

","Will Ferrell really picks this movie up and carries it on his shoulders. I think, without him, I wouldn't have laughed once. That's a testament not only to how hilarious his improv-esquire comedy is, but also to how lame the supporting cast in this was. Heder's schtick has worn out its welcome, Arnett + Poehler are both pretty weak, and Fischer looks great but brings nothing to her character. She's already typecast, I think. It's got some moments that are utterly brilliant (Hector + the North Korea video in particular) but a lot of the humour falls flat and the story is incredibly generic.

","Honestly, I have found very few of Will Ferrell's roles enjoyable. He just isn't a comic actor that I like. Here he is brash and rude figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels. His main competition is played by Jon Heder, who I always seem to like in his various roles. In fact, he is one of the two characters I like here. He is Jimmy MacElroy, an orphan who was adopted so that his father could turn him into a champion figure skater.<br/><br/>The premise for the move begins when the two men get into a fight during the awards ceremony of a national competition where they tied for 1st place. As punishment, they were banned for life from individual competition. So they each went off and worked in menial jobs.<br/><br/>One day Craig T. Nelson as the old Coach sees a TV news report where the two get into a fight again, and visualizes them as skating partners. There is no rule against them making a comeback as a skating pair, so they are entered and begin training.<br/><br/>The bad guys turn out to be Will Arnett as Stranz Van Waldenberg and Amy Poehler as his sister Fairchild Van Waldenberg. (In real life they are husband and wife.) They are reigning National pairs champions, and they will do anything to win, including getting their sister, Jenna Fischer as Katie Van Waldenberg, to spy on Chazz and Jimmy, and later cause friction designed to break them up before the International competition.<br/><br/>While the movie has numerous funny scenes, overall I found it to be a pretty dumb movie.

That's because everyone is much too occupied watching dirty shows just like this one. But I had my head screwed on right. Not only that, but my family also hated it, too. My sister said that there was nothing in there that was funny (and I don't blame her). I don't even want to know why this thing reached number one at the box office that year.

The movie is short, not very funny and this could be one of Will Ferrell's worst performances. I would hate to see Will Ferrell's career end on a low note, and hopefully the next roles he chooses will be funny and the plot will be much more interesting.

The only film of his that I'd rate is the so-goofy-but-still-funny ""Anchorman"" but his woefully unamusing turn in the disappointing ""Bewitched"" was toe-curlingly bad. In fact, Ferrell had a lot riding on this for him to regain my good favour but thankfully, he had played an absolute blinder. For once, the shouting mania of his usual performances has been replaced by a controlled and brilliant turn that pays off with what might be the best film of his career.<br/><br/>Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, an ego-driven ice skater who lives fast and hard. Developing an intense rivalry with the virginal genius that is Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) that comes to a head at the World Championships in 2002 when the pair are banned for life after a fist-fight at the top of the podium. But after an apparent loophole is discovered, Chazz and Jimmy find themselves swallowing their pride as they team up to compete in the pairs, much to the surprise and disgust of everyone else. But they seriously worry the brother-and-sister team of Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) and their non-skating sister Katie (Jenna Fischer), who soon captures the heart of MacElroy.<br/><br/>Like ""Anchorman"", ""Blades Of Glory"" picks a soft target and goes straight for the jugular - with hilarious consequences. Ferrell is perfect as the sleazy, sex-addicted idiot whose passion for gold is matched only by his hatred of his rival. And Heder tries his best to match Ferrell and he does well enough but this is Ferrell's show. The annoying shouting and over-acting have gone and been replaced by a faultless comic performance. It's surprising that nobody else has picked ice-skating up as a victim for spoofing but the lurid campness and faintly pornographic moves are replicated without much amplification and there is no getting around the fact that this is a funny film. Towards the end, it loses its way just slightly as it veers towards the wrong end of surrealism but because ""Blades Of Glory"" is about as silly and implausible as you can get, it's no great deal.<br/><br/>So what's not to like? Well, to be honest, not a great deal. The humour sometimes steers away from being too ""family-friendly"" but that's like saying ""Casablanca"" is rubbish because it's in black-and-white. I'd happily recommend ""Blades Of Glory"" to almost anyone except ice-skaters who take themselves too seriously. Everyone else will get the joke and enjoy this movie. As for Ferrell, he's back on form but he needs to be more consistent in his roles and his acting to justify his A-list status.

What we get instead are two lead actors doing what they do in every movie they are in and a whole lot of name actors being as effeminate as they possibly can because I guess gay men in the skating community equals a huge laugh riot. I will admit that this film had some funny moments and also some decent acting, but overall the production was shoddy and relied way too much on its stars to bring the fun amidst many redundant routines.<br/><br/>Anyone who reads my reviews knows that I am not a big Will Ferrell fan. Sure I loved him in Stranger Than Fiction, and he can make me laugh hard at times (Old School), but in the end, his boorish, blowhard persona ends up coming into every comedic character he has. I guess if it cashes the checks why add nuance? He does much of the same here and if you like that, than you'll probably be entertained throughout. As far as Jon Heder, I won't go as far as some reviews I've heard, saying the kid can't act or cause laughs if his life depended on it, however, he doesn't really succeed in his role. I think he worked really well with his adopted father, played with a one-note performance by William Fichtner, but that only lasts about five minutes. When he is alone and with Ferrell he goes into a geeky tantrum trying to prove his manhood, and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the husband and wife team of Will Arnett and Amy Poehler is humorous as the competition. Their schemes are enjoyable and Arnett's dimwittedness is a nice foil to Poehler's take-charge emotional blackmailing of their sister into doing their dirty work. That sister, played by Jenna Fischer, is the best part of this film. She plays the cute yet shy girl well and her naïveté mixed with her ability to look the part of a sex-fiend or wholesome woman works perfectly in the role. I also enjoyed Romany Malco. No matter how much I don't want to applaud one of the many ""acting gay"" performances, I thought his reactions were spot on. Maybe it was because he is the total opposite on the brilliant show ""Weeds,"" but when he just stares, shaking his head at what is set before him, I always chuckled.<br/><br/>The thing I can't forgive is the horrible use of special effects on the skating sequences. All the cuts to extreme close-ups after long shots were annoying by themselves, (I know these actors can't do the moves themselvesat least don't go back and forth so much making it obvious), but when they tried digitally grafting Ferrell's and Heder's faces onto the faces of the real skaters I was literally cringing. The faces were stretched on and totally fake. Also, when the actors were participating in a difficult move, the movement became stilted and stop-motion-like from the amateurish wirework. When one was lifted into the air, the fast paced camera-work zoomed out and the actors slowly moved around until they touched back down to the ice. And then what do we get? Oh, yeah, a close-up of the actors to make sure we don't forget they are the ones doing the skating. One more thing, too, is the overuse of the TV background footage of how they got there. This movie is the king of using clichés and gimmicks til the very end instead of spicing things up with an original idea.<br/><br/>Despite it all, though, I can't give Blades of Glory a totally dismal mark because of one priceless scene. When Will Arnett and Will Ferrell are in a chase to get to the stadium on skates, I couldn't stop laughing. Sure it was all normal and stupid when they put their skates on and race to the skating complex in the distance, but when they set foot onto pavement and the chase slows to a crawl as they try not to fall, I loved it. Granted, I would have liked them to do more with the escalator, (why show us their skates lodging in the grooves of the steps if they don't get stuck at the top?), however, once the crossbow comes into play all is redeemed. The scene reminded me a lot of the backstreet brawl in Anchorman, another film I abhorred, and wouldn't mind if I had the opportunity to see just that one scene again."
"guyfromjerzee","5","3","6","7 April 2007"," Funny idea......not so well-executed
","Will Ferrell's movies almost never fail to make me laugh out loud, so naturally I was eager to check out this flick. After seeing ""Old School,"" ""Anchorman"" and ""Talledega Nights""--how can I go wrong? Though I wouldn't totally blame Ferrell for this film's shortcomings, I was pretty disappointed. The premise is great. Many funny ideas can derive from the sometimes-ridiculous sport of figure skating. I think the filmmakers figured, ""We have a movie about a two-male figure skating team starring Will Ferrell. What else do we need?"" What we're left with is a bit of a one-joke comedy, with only a few laugh-out-loud moments. Maybe if Ferrell co-wrote the film, like he did with ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights,"" the gags would've been sharper. I can tell some of the sight gags probably sounded funnier on paper, and of course some of the sight gags are simply repetitive and go on way too long (i.e.: a scene involving Will Arnett chasing after Ferrell, both wearing ice skates).<br/><br/>As I mentioned in my review for ""School for Scoundrels,"" I'm convinced that Jon Heder is only good at playing Napoleon Dynamite. Let's face it, the character he played in that movie was very broad and doesn't require as much real acting chops as is needed in the roles he's been taking lately. He has minimal acting skills and doesn't have great comic timing. When he's not portraying an over-the-top character like Napoleon, he's simply bland. On the bright side, the gorgeous Jenna Fischer has a supporting role in the film. I've always thought she was pretty when watching her on ""The Office,"" but after seeing her in skimpy lingerie....I'm practically in love with her. My God, there is not a more beautiful sight than Jenna Fischer in skimpy lingerie! If there is a compliment I can give to the film, it's that the two main characters were not written as homosexuals. I'm sure some writers would've taken the safe route and had them play flamboyant homosexual figure skaters, since it's the stereotype that almost all male skaters are gay (though I'm sure a substantial number of them are). So if you're a Will Ferrell fan like me, you might be disappointed. I wasn't looking for a biting, satirical, intellectual comedy. I was just looking to laugh my head off, and in that regard, the film falls flat."
"gaz_uwic","7","3","6","7 April 2007"," Ferrell on form!
","This is the story of two figure skaters - Jimmy McIllroy (Jon Heder) and Chazz Michael Michaels (the excellent Will Ferrell) - who, having been disqualified from singles competitions, form the first ever male duo partnership in order to attempt to win ice skating glory. The two leads are like chalk and cheese - Heder's character the clean living, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth type and Ferrell's self proclaimed 'sex addict'. The film itself has laugh out loud moments - mostly involving Ferrell - but, in the second half is also quite a charming film that sees you cheering McIllroy and Michaels along (although, obviously you know what's going to happen). The first 40 minutes of the film are admittedly quite slow as we get to meet the characters and learn a bit about their backgrounds. Yes, it's necessary but you can't help but feel there could have been a few more laughs along the way. Having said this though the second half more than makes up for it. The laughs come thick and fast, often with 'weiner' jokes, but it's the way you, or specifically Will Ferrell, that tells them! The dance and ice skating routines are well choreographed and offer laughs within themselves and there's an overall heart warming climax to the film that you can't help but enjoy. Be you a die hard Will Ferrell fan or not, go see this film for chuckles galore and a good night out!"

","I run a movie theater and have worked with films for several years now. I thought this to be another typical silly funny movie with a few chuckles but not much else and a lot of downtime and back plot that did not need to be there. When I watched it I was laughing throughout almost the entire film and found Ferral and Heder to be great actors playing off of each other with fantastic outcome. A review in my area commented on this movie as being Talladega nights on ice and Napoleon dynamite on ice, i totally disagree. Ferral was great at improving (he had to, they just could not have written some of his lines, lol) and Heder was totally his own character being Jimmy, I never thought he was Napolion and would go ""such an idiot!"". This person could not have actually seen this movie, they were just going off of typecasts. I thought the same thoughts, but did not voice them, and after seeing this film, I was very pleasantly surprised and recommend seeing it to all who were worried it would be a flop:) ""Capture the Dream"" :)"
"bboguhn","10","3","6","31 March 2007"," An instant classic
","This film is an instant classic. If you love Ron Burgundy and Ricky Bobby, then this film is for you. For me, it was better than Talladega Nights and almost as good as Anchorman. Ferrell is at his best, playing Chazz Michael Michaels as extremely as he can. Most of the laughs in the film come from him. Jon Heder, though, provides an innocence to the film that another actor might not have been able to pull off. And it was nice seeing Jenna Fischer in there. Perfectly cast, perfectly acted, perfectly written. Hats off to Ben Stiller for producing this beauty. If you're up for laughs, sit back and let this film take you on a 90 minute ride."
"kierz-2","7","3","6","31 March 2007"," How can something so wrong be so right?
","Will Ferrell and Jon Heder in another chocolate and peanut-butter experiment from the comedy studios, end up being more like a chicken sushi roll, too weird to explain, and too tasty to not enjoy. Blades of Glory is to figure skating what Baseketball was to MLB, ridiculously and barely related and yet surprisingly fun. The doubling, L-Cam and wirework effects were pretty good as they were far off enough from reality already to give themselves enough license to do whatever they wanted. Jon Heder shows some range from his ""Aww, shucks,"" persona of Benchwarmers and School for Scoundrels, and Will Farrell is definitely reaching somewhere between Ron Burgundy and Ricky Bobby for his Chazz, both almost original but not quite. While these characters work well off each other it is the very wrongness, the taboo breaking of having two men going crotch to face and trying to act like it isn't happening that makes this far more amusing retrospectively, than the sheer shock value of the infamous scene in Borat. Admittedly the latter had me almost hurt myself laughing at the time, every time I think of it since I want to press Delete in my brain. While this movie had me shaking my head, at least in this case I could look my wife in the eye and smile and shrug and be pleased to see her laughing rather than worry if I was going to get in trouble for bringing her (Like I write these things!). Considering the subject matter of men's pairs figure skating, sex addiction, incest and stalking are all par for the course for this film, it was surprisingly appropriate and easy to stomach, certainly a feat as memorable as the Iron Lotus."
"the_Poppuns","8","3","6","30 March 2007"," A few slight wobbles, but they stuck the landing
","I really enjoyed it. The very beginning seemed a little off. I don't know I think I was actually judging their skating at first. Ferrell looked like he wasn't doing anything but Heder looked pretty good and I guess I thought that I couldn't believe that anyone would think their performances were even close. I know it's a silly movie not a skating competition but as a figure skating fan those critical reflexes just kick in. Craig T. Nelson, I'm not a huge fan of either, so it took a while for me to adjust to what seemed to be a slow building to something. At least I was hoping it was.<br/><br/>Well once we get to the point when they do decide to team up it's all smooth sailing from there. I personally have always wanted to see a pairs team made of two men so it's interesting that the thought occurred to someone else. I guess there was a fair amount of computer effects for the skating scenes but they came off really well. I saw a few figure skaters names during the credits for stunt work so I guess that's how they did it, but you couldn't tell. There were a lot of laughs especially from Will Arnett who, let's face it, is a god among men and I could have used more scenes with him. Blamey was alright. Jon Heder did a really good job as a stereotypical figure skater and I have to admit that he looked really good with that hair. Terrible but true. Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell. He does his normal thing as a dufus/sweetie. The only person I didn't like was that girl from The Office. I don't think she was good for this kind of comedy.<br/><br/>I think fans of figure skating should love it and Will Ferrell fans should too. So that's everyone right? I was going to give it a 7 but then they used my favorite theme song for their final skate so that bumped it up to an 8/10."

","Real-life married couple Amy & Will shine as the villains you love to hate. (They don't actually exhibit ""sexual friction as a brother & sister skating team"", as I read somewhere. So relax.) <br/><br/>All the supporting comedy performers are great -- however Jon Heder just is not in the same acting league as the rest of them. (I kept thinking: ""Hey, there's Rob Corddry. Now HE'D be great in this part. Or Owen Wilson. Or Jack Black.... Or....."")<br/><br/>But I guess they needed a flyweight actor that Will Ferrell could lift over his head. However, Jon does look dazzling in those skating costumes.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell does his usual great job, but the material is thin. (Like in his skating costume.) <br/><br/>These sure are two homely male leads. I have to wonder: Would two equally funny and average-looking women be given starring roles in a film? I think they'd be told to sit in the back of the bleachers for the crowd scenes.<br/><br/>(But enough of my bitter personal experiences in Hollywood!) <br/><br/>Oh and Pam from ""The Office"" is in the film. Sort of. She seems to be in Jon Heder's comedy acting league.<br/><br/>Look closely at the long shots in the skating climax. You can clearly see it is the skating doubles, not Will and Jon.<br/><br/>The film is good -- but not great. It seems to be missing something -- like an Act 2.

"oneloveall","5","6","17","30 March 2007"," Covers it's comedic niche with about as little effort as possible but still provides a few memorable laughs
","Not being a huge fan of Will Ferrell's overdone antics, my expectations were at a humbled minimum upon viewing the latest showcase for his repetitious, though always smart comedic offerings. Surprisingly, the bland and undercooked laugher dealing with two silly men figure skating as a pair, barely managed to appease even my lowest predictions. Playing out like yet another halfway developed, openly lazy, SNL-sketch-launched-to-big-screen, the little laughter Ferrell can muster does not save the majority of lifeless chuckles that miss the humor mark. Often I found myself dispelling air in a way that sort of prompts the psyche for belly laughs, but hardly being able to follow through. All these insincere, mere formalities of dispirited chuckling may have indicated a uniform cleverness throughout the lame plot's dialog, but rarely rises to the level of hilarity a good comedy is supposed to provide. Only near the end, in the actual skating routines does the humor excel at invigorating the crowd, while a majority of the scenes beforehand demonstrate an under-rehearsed duo largely forsaking any synergy the script had called for between the two flamboyant leads.<br/><br/>Credit the continual and baffling casting of Jon Heder in these lead comedic roles as one of the chief reasons much of the laughter rarely lifts off the ground. Ever since landing the iconic role in Napolean Dynamite, to which he played to a tee, producers have made the mistake in thinking Heder can actually act outside of the narrow dork he so readily defined in that indie smash hit, and every big budget comedy that has cast him in a primary role since has suffered for it. While not necessarily a poor casting choice to have him playing the uber-fairy skater Jimmy MacElroy, Heder simply cannot rise above his trite delivery to provide any sort of edgy humor in any scenes, that responsibility falls squarely on Mr. Will.<br/><br/>Though admirably keeping any witty vulgarity flowing naturally as the macho, sex-addicted, drug-using figure skater, Ferrell's character feels too recycled from random other characters he's portrayed to create much of a genuine funniness, a far-cry from his more involved work with partner Adam Mckay (the more creatively average Talladega Nights). In the end the king of offbeat one liners and the charisma-less ultra dork are oddly enough upstaged by relative newcomer and gifted sideman Nick Swardson in an inspired and perceptive take on the stalking psychopath, demonstrating a hunger for comedic delivery that is all but noticeable throughout the majority of mediocrity."

While I wasn't aching with belly laughs, it was a very funny and likable movie. The rest of the audience seemed to be having a good time too.

"bob the moo","Null","2","4","28 November 2007"," Not as hilarious as I wanted but amusing nonetheless, and with some good moments
","In the world of male solo figure skating, two US giants are ahead of the pack. Jimmy MacElroy was raised from a boy with the single goal of being a champion, with the millions of champion-maker Darren MacElroy behind him. Chazz Michael Michaels is the opposite of MacElroy's perfect presentation  a rough and ready man with a sex addiction but yet undeniable talent. The two have battled for years but things come to a head when they share gold medal position. On the podium a fight breaks out between them and the pair are banned for life from the sport. Years later they are both doing nothing but getting by until MacElroy's stalker approaches them with a loophole in the sport rules  they are only banned from single events, not pairs.<br/><br/>Undeniably silly this thing but yet quite pleasing at the same time. We have seen this sort of sports spoof several times over the last few years and the quality has ranged with some highs in Dodgeball but others not totally working as well such as Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Blades of Glory falls more in the latter camp as it is not brilliant but still has fun if you are in the mood. Considering the idea behind it I was rather surprised that it was not constantly off-the-wall material but mostly it had me amused throughout. The plot is straightforward but serviceable. The skating is outrageously silly (although some of the effects do push it) and overblown in a carefree way. The script does have some really good lines but too often I found myself looking for more than the dialogue was giving me.<br/><br/>Ferrell is good in the main role and he works the fact that, ignoring everything else, he is still a very unlikely figure skater. Heder is very much secondary to him because of the differences in the characters but he is good value for what he gets to do. Arnett and Poehler do tend to steal any scene that they are in, while Fischer is an enjoyable addition. Fichtner, Nelson and others fill out the cast well. As with Dodgeball, I enjoyed the commentators and the script does make good sport of them, but I would have liked them to have been more a part of the film than they were.<br/><br/>Overall though, despite it not being the most hilarious or clever thing you'll ever see, it does have plenty of laughs and did consistently amuse me even it did lack that many really good moments."

A few laughs? Absolutely. Have we seen this plot before? Surely. Even the casting of the legendary skater Scott Hamilton doesn't come as a surprise. Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill have (thankfully) non-speaking cameos. Let's keep adding those cliché ingredients to make another mediocre comedy: the pretty love interest, the kooky adversaries, the domineering coach, etc, etc. Here are the comedies that come to mind with this same old formula: Dodgeball. Anchorman. Kicking and Screaming. You get the picture. Ferrell, remember Stranger than Fiction?

Besides that, this movie has a great plot, and is very well put together in my opinion. It's a great movie to see with friends or on a date. This movie is definitely one of the best this year. If you want to see a good movie, see Blades of Glory. No joke. Usually I like to wait and rent new movies, but this is definitely and totally worth paying 6 to 9 dollars for."

","Blades of Glory stars John Heder and Will Ferrell as skaters who, due to zany circumstances beyond their control, are forced to skate together as the sport's first male-male pair. The comic premise here, as if it needs explaining, is that figure skating, at least in pairs' form, is all about sex. And no, it's not implicitly sexual, but you'll see when you watch this that the nature of the sport is that it just does not work when you stick two definitively heterosexual men into it. The results will make you cringe. But is it funny? Well, sort of.<br/><br/>Another lesson the film reminded me of was that Will Ferrell, hilarious as he is, doesn't make a good movie by himself. You need to add in the right complements: preferably a screenwriter like Adam McKay and costars with improvisational ability like John C. Riley, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, and Vince Vaughn. When this happens, the actors get into a zone where jokes bounce off one another in a way that can't miss and they yield comic classics like ""Old School"", ""Talladega Nights"", and ""Anchorman."" This film has its moments but it never really gets into that zone. It has its quotable lines and flashes of brilliance that will make for a good trailer. The film features great performances by some great comic actors who with any luck will be able to use this as a springboard to bigger and better roles. These are Saturday Night Live's Amy Poehler and Will Arnett (formerly of Arrested Development) as a rival pair, as well as The Office's Jenna Fischer as their goody-two-shoes sister. But still, the film never creates that atmosphere where you're laughing so hard you can't focus on anything else. It doesn't have enough momentum to carry over from scene to scene. It might be because after Dodgeball and Talladega Nights, sports parodies are no longer a novelty. It might be because Ferrell might just be overusing the same macho comic persona a little too much. It might also be John Heder. I'm not sure whether I want him to succeed at something other than Napoleon Dynamite so that people can once and for all move past Napoleon Dynamite (which I thought was decent but nowhere near as deserving of all the praise it received), or if I just want people to just skip the middle step and forget Napoleon Dynamite AND John Heder, period. The point is that if you subscribe to my theory that Napoleon Dynamite was a complete fluke of film popularity as it relates to film quality, than Heder has a lot to prove in your eyes if he wants to share the screen with Ferrell. Whether he delivers is arguable. He does have some range and proves he can be people other than Napoleon Dynamite, but I don't think he meets the bar set by Will Ferrell's costars, at least in this particular movie."

","A bit of ballet, precision, and dignity accrue to figure skating, a small world where civility dances with ability. Enter Will Ferrell, the defoliator of formula racing and TV broadcasting (among other occupations), to skewer the rarefied competition of Olympic figure skating.<br/><br/>Joining Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite slacker blasting, Ferrell's mock machismo makes him the Tom Jones and Heder the Owen Wilson of ice. Ferrell's Chazz Michael Michaels and Heder's Jimmy MacElroy are disqualified from competition because of their infantile public combat. They reconcile in time to enter competition as a team.<br/><br/>As in most Ferrell outings, the laughs are sparse but satisfactory for a lightly satirical evening at the movies. Some outrageous bits such as flames shooting from Chazz's palms and a beheading during an extreme act evoke laughs if only for their audacity, not to mention the Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting where Chazz can barely contain his abstinence.<br/><br/>A bit of gay bashing is requisite in comedies today, and two men skating begs for the satire, yet Blades of Glory does little of it in favor of its roasting pretentious figure skating. The innuendos for the brother and sister team, bitter and unethical rivals of the boys, provide tantalizing hints of incest as well. But mostly it's Ferrell's self inflating character that carries the film.<br/><br/>The climactic competition, you guessed it: between the boys and the brother/sister team, concludes with an amusingly outrageous assault on JFK and Marilyn Monroe (albeit way too short to do justice to the possible outrages such a satire could yield), an affront to those who revere those icons, a delight to those who see pretense and revisionist history as fair game for SNL and Will Ferrell. Blades of Glory is not going to be the comedy of the year, but it will provide laughs anyway."

","""Blades of Glory"" is a formulaic but funny comedy starring Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as a pair of male ice skaters. The plot's ""Dodgeball"" meets ""Cool Runnings"" meets ""Semi Pro"" meets ""every Will Ferrell"" movie, but Ferrell manages to elevate things somewhat. He plays Chazz Michael Michaels, a crotch-grabbing, man-chest exposing ""ice devouring sex tornado"". Jon Heder, who took straight faced ridiculousness to remarkable heights in ""Napoleon Dynamite"", matches Ferrell's brand of dead-pan goofiness blow for blow.<br/><br/>There are several epochs of irony, one of which American comedy seems to currently be wallowing in (Ferrell is a caricature of a dopey American, blissfully unaware of how ridiculous he is to the rest of the world). First you had Socratic irony, which was really a form of rhetorical dialogue. From this – saying the opposite of what's true to underline the truth - you'd trace a line from Chaucer, to More, Sidney and Milton, arriving finally at Swift and Austen. Then you had Romantic irony, which was a sort of philosophical tool. German philosopher Karl Schlegel believed that it bestowed a ""multiplicity of perspectives"" from which the ""truth could then be unlocked"". Then you had a sort of post WW1 irony which was used as a tool of dissent to highlight the disjunction between, say, patriotic rhetoric and the reality of war. This led to a widespread use of irony as a means of puncturing deceitful propaganda. Up until this point irony always had some moral objective; it offered an overview, serving to cut through accepted wisdom and expose fraudulence. It might say ""This belief is wrong"", but it doesn't say ""All belief is wrong"". But then came the era of postmodernity, which trades in postmodern irony. Here, everything is exclusively self-referential, there is always an implication that art is used up (and so justifiably recyclable), and irony is used to undermine all sincerity, all possibility of truth, all emotion, all moral certainty, as well as to kill off the possibility of a meaningful moral position. Irony, then, is indistinguishable from cynicism. It now assert its right to have no position whatsoever. It now says ""nothing at all"". As Paul de Man pointed out, ""this does not make it into an authentic language, for to know inauthenticity is not the same as being authentic."" <br/><br/>Meanwhile, every comedy coming out of the US wears a badge of goofy irony, satire even, without actually being about anything. These scripts go far beyond making no effort to laughing about their lack of effort. Of course holding Ferrell responsible for a lack of radical comedy is silly, especially when you consider that his ""The Other Guys"" is pretty much the only watchable mainstream satire about the recent global financial crisis.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing. See Ferrell in ""Everything Must Go"", based on a Raymond Carver story."

","Someone told me that this film was either alright or rubbish, I can't remember which, but the two opinions wouldn't make a difference to me wanting to see the film. Basically there is rivalry between the two world famous professional ice figure skaters, sex addict and improviser Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) and germ fearing and precise Jimmy MacElroy (Napoleon Dynamite's Jon Heder). After getting into a very heated fight on the awards platform that according to law they are banned from the ice skating event for life, causing them three years later to go into skating related only jobs, e.g. skating pantomime and selling them. Desperate for gold medal glory once again, one of the two men reads the rules carefully about competing in ice skating championships, and according to law, they originally did singles skating, there is nothing that says they cannot compete in doubles. Therefore Chazz and Jimmy try to patch up any differences and tram up in order to become the first ever male-male pair to skate together, going against new skating sensations the Van Waldenberg, Stranz Van (The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret's Will Arnett) and Fairchild (Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel's Amy Poehler). After mixed rehearsals and slowly building up a working relationship, Chazz and Jimmy enter the World Championship Pair's Division with hundreds of surprised faces, but end their performance with a standing ovation. Coach (The Incredibles' Craig T. Nelson) knows that the final of the competition has to have something that will stun everyone, and he shows them a clip of the most dangerous skating move ever performed, with fatal consequences if done wrong, called the ""Iron Lotus"", he wants them to perform it. Before they can get to the final, they are kidnapped by Stranz and Fairchild, and they kill the Winter Sport Games Mascot, Snowflake, and they get away to beat them while restrained. Of course Chazz and Jimmy escape and make it to the ice rink just in time, and despite the original rehearsal planning, they swap places for the potentially deadly skate move, but they do it, the Van Walderbers are arrested, Jimmy kisses their daughter and his love interest Katie (Jenna Fischer), and they win the gold returning to glory. Also starring William Fichtner as Darren MacElroy, Romany Malco as Jesse, Nick Swardson as Hector and Rob Corddry as Bryce. Ferrell and Heder together make a great comedic duo, the skating sequences are surprisingly good viewing, especially to songs like Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" and Queen's ""Flash"", a good fun ice skating comedy. Worth watching!"

","""Blades of Glory"" might as well sell itself as a live production called ""Ron Burgundy and Napoleon Dynamite on Ice."" Stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder do nothing to escape the comedic shells that have consumed their careers and while the results are sometimes funny in that cozy, familiar way, it's all rather stale, especially when thrown into a typical sports underdog plot line.<br/><br/>The film applies both the styles of Heder and Ferrell to the world of professional figure skating, which the writers must have thought was ripe with comedic opportunity. Instead, it ends up being full of spots to crack homophobic jokes and bathe in the comedic awkwardness of guys touching guys. Essentially, the two world-renowned skaters' hostility costs them their careers, leaving their only chance to skate again up to a loophole in the skating world that says they can compete as an all-male pair.<br/><br/>Ferrell is at his most stereotypical playing a Chazz Michael Michaels, an ignorant, childish and narcissistic sex-addict, not all that different from when he made a cameo as another Chazz in ""Wedding Crashers."" It works sometimes because it's Ferrell doing what he's best at: tossing out creative insults and flaunting his unfit, harry body, but with years having past since ""Anchorman,"" it's a tired act. Heder, who hasn't found much luck post-Napoleon Dynamite, doesn't get any luckier playing Jimmy MacElroy, a wimpy, whiny child skating prodigy. These comedians aren't channeling their talents into new characters, they're merely spitting out lines in attempt to be funny because their characters are written to their strengths and not to be unique, or entertaining for that matter.<br/><br/>The most likable thing about ""Blades of Glory"" might be its supporting cast. While there's always the Saturday Night Live junket (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play Tanya Harding- esquire antagonists), Jenna Fischer of ""The Office"" plays the love interest and Craig T. Nelson makes the most amusing appearance as Michaels and MacElroy's coach, a role he made famous on television in the show ""Coach."" Nick Swardson, a Happy Madison product, is also quite enjoyable as an effeminate psycho-stalker of MacElroy.<br/><br/>There's a decent amount of good material, like Arnett chasing Ferrell through Montreal on ice skates or Ferrell ruining the on-ice kids show that employs him when he begins vomiting inside his costume, but there's nothing exciting or new to latch on to that makes the film more than simply worthwhile. It's easy to watch, but it's certainly at the bottom of the pile for Will Ferrell and others."

","The best way to describe this movie is ""light"". It's fairly innocent, filled with low-key humor and has a simple plot. If it strongly appeals to any audience, it would probably rank highest with very young teenagers. That said, the movie does have a slightly redeeming quality: the first 15 minutes are actually really good - if you're going to watch anything, see that much.<br/><br/>Basically, the story is about two competitive male ice skaters who, because of excessive bickering (that turns physical), get kicked out of their sport. However, they soon learn that they are still eligible to compete in ""doubles"" ... and that they are the perfect (any only viable) partners for each other. It's anything but smooth sailing! While the two lead actors (Ferrell and Heder) do a reasonably good job, the material they have is only a bit above average. It's good, but not quite past the threshold needed for a string of real laughs.<br/><br/>Storywise, it's pretty simple. Team up ... attempt to overcome obstacles ... compete in big event for the ""gold medal"". The events and cameos by major ice-skating superstars (Brian Boitano, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming) make the movie mildly amusing, but it never really takes off.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, the first 15 minutes are the best part of the whole movie; if you're going to watch anything, see that much.

","I was really pretty disappointed in this movie. I just watched it on HBO because frankly it didn't look all that funny from the ads. It had some decent laughs strewn throughout but nothing flat-out hilarious. I'm not the stuffy kind of viewer who hates physical comedy either. I can watch Anchorman for the 5th time and still laugh out loud pretty hard a few times, but this never had those moments for me.<br/><br/>It's the typical Will Ferrell movie where he is the idiot savant and the joke's on him. He never realizes it or just rolls with it, you know the rest. He was funny here and there and can still come up with the completely off-the-wall things to say. Heder is better when he talks less. I loved Napoleon Dynamite, but here his character was the Will Ferrell style of over-the-top. Didn't make sense to me so much. Arnett and the SNL chick were OK, but could've been given some funnier things to do.<br/><br/>Really the best part was Jenna Fischer in a corset. She seemed to be well-aware that the role was pretty silly and she didn't fit in the movie that well. But then again, they needed a pretty goody-two shoes and she seems to fit that. I'd like her to aim a little higher though, as I bet she could do some pretty good comedy with a good script.<br/><br/>Better than the 50th showing of ""Breakfast Club"" on TBS but not better than the 30th you know what I mean?

","A very fun and entertaining comedy that does a seamless blend of over-the-top physical comedy combined with a subtle but respectful mockery of the ice skating profession. The genius, and downfall, of the film all comes in the casting. The decision to put Will Arnett and Amy Poehler in the same film is one of the most remarkable and praiseworthy of all time. The decision to make the husband/wife team play siblings is even more brilliant. The extra step of adding Jenna Fischer as their other sibling is almost too orgasmic to still be wearing pants. But then...oh, then the earthquake of pain and suffering comes. This is in the form of the unexplainably working Jon Heder. The man is a disgrace to the world. You shouldn't put him on the big screen, you should hide him in a coffin at the bottom of the Atlantic. He isn't and never will be funny in any form of the word, until he is being murdered by me in which I'll be laughing my head off. Ferrell is always fun, though he is still just playing the 'Arrogant, idiotic and talented' type that he's been playing since 2004's Anchorman. Scenes between him and Heder, which is the majority of the film, only help to make me realize how little screen time the combination of Arnett, Poehler and Fischer had and how they needed about a thousand times more. The film should have just been this trifecta, instead of the idiocy of Jon Heder ruminating through my eyes for an hour and a half. The Iron Lotus was still one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen, though.<br/><br/>P.S. - Jenna Fischer was insanely sexy."

The movie has got a funny plot, with two complete opposite contenders there's obvious that there will be some funny moments, but mostly because of Ferrell keeping the small amount of originality he's still got left. Ferrell was glorious in Anchorman, but his career seems very downhill as he obviously performed better as a supporting actor than a leading role. BLADES OF GLORY could surely have been much better, and there's a lot of things failing, but still I couldn't avoid being happily surprised with the final finish as I had very low expectations to his movie.

","I'm fast converting to a Will Ferrell Fan, given that I've laughed out loud at his silly antics, in particular, the recent effort in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. And now, joining forces with yet another up-coming comedian in Jon Heder (School of Scoundrels, The Benchwarmers), I had high hopes of watching Blades of Glory to chase the week's blues away.<br/><br/>However, expectation can be quite a bitch, and while Blades of Glory was funny, it wasn't laugh out loud funny from start to end. It had its moments, but only certain scenes to bring out those tears of nonsensical joy. For the most parts, it was pretty plain sailing - you know it's funny, just nothing to get that extra tickle out of you. And worse yet, the best moments were in the trailer, leaving you wondering if there were any more scenes left in the story to top those.<br/><br/>The story tells of two rival ice skaters who belong to opposite sides of the sport. The introduction plays out like Zoolander, where the profiles of each character are put through funny montages. Jim MacElroy (Heder) is your typical bred-for-excellence sportsman, with impeccable manners, demeanour and discipline, executing his moves by the book. Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) on the other hand, is your bad boy of the sport, a sex-addict who fuses sex into his moves, the master of improvisation whipping female fans everywhere into a frenzy each time he skates. They're like fire and ice, and in one of their typical bickering, bring disgrace to the sport and are banned from the men's competition for life.<br/><br/>Until a loophole is discovered, and they combine forces, unwillingly, to return to the sport under the pairs competition, irking reigning champions, Van Waldenberg siblings of Stranz (Will Arnett) and Fairchild (Amy Poehler). Threatened by the ludicrous return of Michael Michaels and MacElroy, with their pedigree pairing and stealing of limelight, the movie spends for the most last third of the movie on their unscrupulous tactics, and the cause- effect. Thrown into the fray is Jenna Fischer as Katie Van Waldenberg, who provides some uninspired romantic moments with Heder's Jim, and a faux pas sibling rivalry/woe in some emotional blackmail moments.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned, the movie is a mixed bag. I would have expected Farrell's alpha-comedic role and Heder's for-fodder-role to combine seamlessly and bring on great laughs, but the pairing seem to be diluted instead. The best bits naturally are when each of them start to skate, and then skating together during competition, with plenty of moments for physical jokes - the usual groin and gay no holds barred punches. If you'd ask me to choose who's the funnier of the two, my vote will go to Farrell, and he gets more screen time too. Boom! As compared to the whinier Heder who plays the usual roles quite repeatedly.<br/><br/>Fans of Bo Bice will want to sit through the end credits as he sings the theme Blades of Glory, and stay tuned during the credit roll for an additional (though not so funny) extra involving a deranged obsessive fan."

They both rag on Jenna Fisher who plays the ""cinderella"" (Katie Van Waldenberg) of the story.

","Will Ferrell and I have had a tumultuous relationship. Ever since leaving live skit comedy Ferrell has tried far too hard and always makes the films he's in feel like it should be a 3 minute skit and not a 2 hour movie. There are a few exception but I found his creation of the ""Will Ferrell Comedy Troupe"" (Wilson, Stiller, Carell, Rudd) as I call them...more annoying than anything. Anchorman...horrendous....BeWitched...disastrous...Talladega Nights...I could go on. And then every once in awhile he stumbles upon a script that actually suits him and I think it's more complete accident than anything else. Blades of Glory has everything you could want from a slapstick, spoof-like film and it actually all works pretty well together. The idea of it being centered around figure skating immediately makes the premise humorous because if two guys looked less like Figure Skating champions it would be Ferrell and Heder. Add in some great cameos and supporting roles and you've got a brainless and yet laugh out loud good time.<br/><br/>One of the surprising aspects of Blades of Glory is that the two stars share equal time and equal roles despite Ferrell being the bigger of the two stars. Will Ferrell plays overly confident, sexaholic skating star Chazz Michael Michaels. As usual with Ferrell his performance is overblown and as much a farce character as you can get and yet for some reason this time it works. As dumb and idiotic as his character is you actually enjoy him and he has some genuinely funny moments...one of my favorites is his performance on the treadmill as he sings ""My Humps"" and has bread rolls thrown at him by Heder. I can honestly say this is one performance of Ferrell's that I had no problem watching. Part of that I attribute to his co-star Jon Heder who has done a great job pulling himself away from the stereotype of Napoleon Dynamite that made him a star. Granted his performances aren't a far stretch from Napoleon but even still he's lovable and watchable and always manages to be the guy you root for. Heder and Ferrell have great chemistry together and Heder doesn't let Ferrell overshadow him which makes for a great picture. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play their skating adversaries, the devious and disgusting siblings the Van Waldenbergs. They are used sparingly making their performance funny without being overdone. Everyone is used in light moderation and that's the beauty of this comedy is that it's not TOO MUCH but just enough to make it hilarious. Jenna Fischer is very good as Heder's love interest, and Craig T. Nelson is terrific as the straight man to Heder and Ferrell and they all mesh very well together.<br/><br/>The co-directing team of Will Speck and Josh Gordon seem to really nail how the film needs to fit together. It's not one of the funniest films I've ever seen but it's definitely worth seeing and you can't help but get a few good howls out of it. This entire review is coming from someone who hates spoof movies and overall has never liked Will Ferrell but after seeing this I might be more likely to give him a bigger chance next time around. I think the key to surviving a Ferrell movie is the right director and script and being able to control his off the wall, over exaggerated humor and it just so happens that Blades of Glory does exactly that. 8/10"

No I was not looking forward to it. Shame then, because it is very funny when it wants to be. From start to finish I was never low on larfs, particularly in the incredibly slow and awkward shopping mall chase. Jon Heder, he out of dynamite, provides able support, proving that movie was no flash-in-the pan, and there are many moments where Will Ferrell's previously annoying flapping-your-arms-about-the-place routine is actually very well placed here.

He just didn't seem to mesh with anyone, until Anchorman. That was our first indication that he could do something better, and still remain within the comfortable confines of his realm.<br/><br/>Bewitched, besides being a folded comedy with which I could not find total satisfaction, was entertaining, but mainly so due to Michael Caine and Nicole Kidman, but Farrell certainly can NOT take the credit for contributing much at all to that film, other than work and screen-time.<br/><br/>Blades of Glory is the second. It is a story about redemption overlaying a strong comedic premise, which works on screen as well as it did on paper. Two hostile rival Olympic single skaters join forces to compete as a figure-skating duet. Both are men. And they hate one another.<br/><br/>I had little hopes of the execution of this work, having been a somewhat disappointed Farrell fan for years, however, this work far surpassed my expectations (or lack thereof). Farrell hasn't found someone with which his quirky, blustery style meshes 100%, but it works well enough to be funny, instead of making you cringe and groan.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this due to Heder's more toned-down pouty comedic style utilized herein. If only Farrell would turn to more intelligent comedy. His fans KNOW he has it in him, and it would be a great improvement. But this was still fun, and more importantly, it was highly entertaining and brings a moral, whether you look or not.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of the best Farrell movies out there, to date.<br/><br/>It rates a 7.6/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","I finally got to see ""Blades of Glory"" three weeks after its initial release and I had only heard positive things about it. Someone even told me that it was a laugh-a-minute thrill ride and came out much funnier than ""Talladega Nights"", which I happened to enjoy. However after getting to watch for myself I have to disagree. While ""Blades of Glory"" was funny, it was achieved in a cutesy kind of way. But the real Grade-A laughs were few and far between. Instead I was placed under a barrage of smirk-inducing gags that made me smile, but came short of laughing-out-loud.<br/><br/>The plot was fairly unique and simple enough for everyone to understand rather quickly. Also the short running time made sure that the story didn't start to sag. The two leads were perfectly cast as Will Ferrell and Jon Heder put in excellent turns as the bad boy and effeminate heterosexual, respectively. It was also great to see Craig T. Nelson back on the screen as he always does an excellent job. The notable appearances from Nick Swardson and Andy Richter were appreciated as well. Actually all the ensemble cast was up to speed except Amy Poehler in my opinion. She just does not seem to be up to par as an actress and I don't think she's funny.<br/><br/>This was a decent film that even breathed out moments of inspiration and had it not been built up so much beforehand I'm sure I'd rank it as excellent. In the end I can't help but feel somewhat letdown by it to a point as far as the humor was concerned, but at least the story was there. It appears that it was meant for a younger audience then Ferrell's latest installments. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone but especially teenagers since this offers more appeal to their age bracket. I'm looking forward to seeing both Ferrell's and Heder's next films still, hopefully they'll both be much cooler...without the ice."

","This movie is for everyone who loves Will Ferrell style humor. The light, sarcastic, silly character he plays went so well with John Heder's depiction of a spoiled feminine ice skating champion that it may send me back for a seconds. Prior to seeing the film, I was a bit concerned that this movie, like some others, would contain dull material as opposed to what was shown in the previews. Fortunately, this was not the case and the previews were only a taste of similar scenes throughout the movie! I kept finding myself surprised at the amount humorous details that kept popping up. The thought that went into the ice skating scenes was matrix special effects meets Saturday night live. I can't wait to buy this for my personal collection."

","This is a great movie for good laugh out loud fun. Heder gets out of his ""Napoleon Dyanamite"" image, showing how well he can portray a delicate, determined skater. A better performance that on ""The Benchwarmers"" with Rob Schneider and David Spade. Ferrell,another great performance, is funny as usually as a bad boy skating star. Amy Pohler , performed in ""Saturday Night Live"" along with Will Ferrell, also does a great job as a spoiled star skater. The skating scenes are hilarious and incredible and the last scene gives the audience suspense and laughter. There is also a good meaning of friendship and teamwork. Funny plot, funny, characters, you will laugh throughout the whole movie."

","We have all seen Saturday Night Live, and Will Ferrel wasn't very much of the main character. But he was in more than a handful of hilarious sketches. Now he's doing great movies like Elf (8 stars), Anchorman (7 stars), and of course The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (9 stars). This movie (Blades of Glory)is a lot like the ballad of Ricky Bobby. In Ricky Bobby, the movie starts out with 2 friends, Will Ferrel, and John C. Reilly. They become enemies near the middle, and become friends again at the end. It's about sports, love, and jokes that you will never stop laughing at.<br/><br/>Now, Blades of Glory, it starts out with 2 enemies, not 2 friends. They do something bad and can't skate in their division anymore. Jon Heder's queer fan says that Jon can skate in pairs. They skate in pairs, and Will Ferell (Chazz Michael Michaels) does a lot of hilarious jokes that never cease to be funny. Blah, Blah, Blah, they win the champions, and you will never stop laughing so hard in your life! 9.5 stars, baby!!!!!"

","Two male figure skaters of distinctly different personalities: Graceful,girlish and innocent Jimmy MacElroy(Jon Heder,who takes comedic physical abuse better than just about anybody!)and boorish,Alpha-MAle and sex-addicted hotshot Chazz Michael Michaels(Will Ferrell,back to his usual,oily,near-improvisational comedic self)have battled each other constantly over the better part of the last decade,finally have their rivalry come to a head in the Olympics,which leads to both skaters being banned from competitive skating for life.<br/><br/>Of course,that can't be the end of story and,sure enough,when alerted to the loophole in the competition rules of the sport,Jimmy seeks to find someone to pair with to compete in pairs figure skating. Of course,he has absolutely no luck finding a female,but bumps into Chazz--now a washed out actor at a ""Disney-on-Ice""-style show--and is talked into,by his similarly burned-out mentor(Craig T.Nelson,not-too-gruff),pairing up with his former bitter rival to recapture some of their previous glory.<br/><br/>With super support from the villains of the movie,that being in the form of a brother-sister pairs combo(played with the right amount of sneer by comic aces Will Arnett and Amy Poehler),this film runs with the predictability of a Swiss watch. Ditto that of the sweet potential love interest(a charming and sexy-cute Jenna Fischer)and at least one cameo of the usual suspects of Ferrell-based comedies:Luke Wilson as a sex addiction counselor. Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck,chartering a story and script by Busy Phillips and John Altschuler,are nearly transparent here,as you the viewer,if you seen any films like this(i.e. Old School,Talledega Nights for examples)coming miles away. For the most part,though,I didn't mind at all. <br/><br/>Unabashedly over-the-top and tailored to fit the stars of the show(particularly Ferrell),this film makes no apologies for being a loud,colorful and vulgar comedy. My summary line comes from my theory that many comedies,particularly ones that are major studio financed and fronted by bankable stars,have a quality similar to empty-calorie or junk food: incredibly tasty,immediately satisfying and utterly lacking of anything of deeper value. Still,films like this are good palate-cleansers,particularly after a winter and fall season of movies where the solid quality lie in mostly dark,searing dramas(examples:Letters from Iwo JIma,Breach) and inventive,sanguinary action movies(example:300). Bottom line: I laughed enough to find this well-worth the viewing experience,and assuming you aren't prejudiced by who or what is in this offering,I suspect many of you will feel the same,too."

","I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the film. At first I thought it would be a bit cheesy and perhaps dumb but as soon as it started all those thoughts left and I was presented with a hysterical feature. One of the things ""Blades"" has going for it is that it is not over the top, which may occur in such a film, ""Blades"" leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>Farrell and Heder do make a good team. Both of their characters possess qualities and quirks that are similar to past roles but that does not lessen their performances but in fact adds to them by creating a familiar relationship with the audiences. Poehler and Arnett play very entertaining villains and contribute frequently to the ridiculousness of the film.<br/><br/>The movie provided laughs throughout, several via the skating and one of my favorite sequences is a chase scene between Farrell and Arnett that will not be soon forgotten. This is one of the movies I can just think about and bust out laughing. ""Blades"" delivers for the kind of movie it is supposed to be. My only suggestion would be to bring a friend."

","Competitive ice skating is an easy target for satire comedy, and the outlandish premise of this movie was inevitable. Although it's predicated on a joke that invites a sophomoric and slapstick approach, there are enough cleverly devised bits here to make it work.<br/><br/>Two guys join forces to compete as an unprecedented two-man team in pairs figure skating, and the resulting sight gags are usually pretty funny. Chazz Michaels (Will Farrell) is a beer chugging slob, and Jimmy MacElroy (John Heder) is a clean-cut pretty boy type. The collision of the two stereotypes bounce off each other pretty well, in an ""Odd Couple on Ice"" sort of way. One weakness is that Farrell occasionally overplays his part, while Heder understates his, and the two approaches don't always mesh. Another minor problem is the editing of the competition sequences; for example, you see very little of the rival couple's final routine. Supporting actors are uniformly strong, the best being Jenna Fischer as Katie, the girlfriend of one of the two skaters in a cute subplot. Cameo roles of well known champion skaters poking fun at themselves were a nice touch.<br/><br/>A screwball comedy that provides laughs throughout, with a few comic moments that are downright hilarious. It's good, silly popcorn fare, and worth a look."

","I'm a Will Ferrell fan, and have been for some time now. This said, however, I was extremely disappointed with Talledega Nights. Except for a few funny moments, it was about as entertaining as the sport it made fun of. I was afraid that Ferrell might have lost his touch, but all my fears vanished as I watched Blades of Glory. It is every bit as good as Anchorman, with almost as many quotable lines. Heder and Ferrell are backed by a solid supporting cast, including SNL's Amy Poehler, Arrested Development's Will Arnett, and Jenna Fischer of The Office (USA). This film is the third in Ferrell's ongoing project of satirizing masculinity by portraying various stereotypical male icons of less than normal intelligence. I found myself laughing from the opening brawl until the final showdown, and quoting the movie with my friends for the rest of the night. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an hour and a half of laughs in the theater and a week or more of laughs from repeating lines with your friends."

","Don't get me wrong, I love Will Ferrell. He has done some of the best comedies that I have ever seen and i'm talking about Anchorman mostly. But this movie just flat out sucked thanks to Jon Heder, I hate him so much and the only thing that he has been in that is watchable is School for Scoundrels and that movie is only saved because of Billy Bob Thornton because in no way is Heder funny. Napoleon Dynamite was stupid, he ruined The Benchwarmers because if that movie would have just been Rob Schneider and David Spade then it would have been a lot funnier and now he has ruined another movie due to one thing and that is that this guy is seriously gay, he always has a role where he mentions doing something with a dude or is actually touched by one like he is multiple times by Ferrell in this. He just needs to come out of the closet and get it over with, at least Neil Patrick Harris had the guts to do it.<br/><br/>Overall this movie gets a 3 out of 10 because there are always a few funny moments with Will Ferrell in his movies, but unfortunately Heder's gay ass just ruined yet another comedy. Shame on any director that casts him for any part unless its Clay Aiken's biography or something. Avoid this movie because anyone who likes it is obviously gay and likes to see figure male figure skaters rub all over each other, and because it is the worst that Will Ferrell has ever done and I hope he progresses with his next one."
"MovieAddict2016","3","2","5","2 August 2007"," Am I missing something here?
","When I saw the ads for ""Blades of Glory,"" I knew what to expect - another funny satire from the Frat Pack lads that wouldn't be anything great but would be filled with some good slapstick and at least have a handful of memorable gags.<br/><br/>Well, I was wrong. Although the approach is similar to comedies such as ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Dodgeball,"" it's definitely the worst film I've seen so far of the ""Frat Pack"" series of films. It just isn't funny.<br/><br/>The problem is that the film is largely a one-joke premise. And it's poking fun at something that is more obvious than something like NASCAR or unpopular like the game of dodgeball - figure skating is such an easy thing to lampoon, but after five minutes of sight gags and jabs at the sexuality of the sport, where is there to go? A plot is formed: Will Ferrell is a bad-boy figure skater who, taking advantage of a legal loophole, joins forces with Jon Heder's androgynous super-skater to win the gold medal. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play a brother-sister duo who become the mandatory Evil Overachievers and attempt to destroy the two skaters by having their sister (Jenna Fischer) go ""undercovers"" and break up the two men's relationship on the ice.<br/><br/>The plot is weak, and the movie knows it's weak, but that's not much of an excuse when your material isn't funny. I once loved Will Ferrell but I've quickly grown tired of him now - his shtick is becoming tiresome. At least Ben Stiller knows how to change various elements of his performances and can create something very funny like White Goodman in ""Dodgeball"" - but Ferrell is just playing the same shtick here that he's been doing for his last few films: an arrogant buffoon who squints his eyes a lot while acting dramatic, yells at people, and says stupid things that he doesn't realize are stupid while keeping a straight face. It was hilarious at first, but now it's really old.<br/><br/>Even a lot of the jokes are recycled. The movie mocks the intensity of those mini-biographies that appear at sports events and awards shows - too bad it was already done (far better) in ""Zoolander."" I also must say that I find Jon Heder to be quite annoying and I don't think he's a very talented comedic actor. It would have been much funnier to see Ferrell paired with someone of talented background - I'd even take Stiller playing his naive-type character again in place of Heder.<br/><br/>Will Arnett is WASTED - he was so hilarious on ""Arrested Development"" and his presence here is thrown away. Jenna Fischer has achieved a level of recognition on ""The Office"" in the U.S. - but this film proves that she won't have much lasting power. She has no absolutely no presence on screen and her character is so thin, unrealistic and - worst of all - totally bland that she comes across as being more insulting than the transparent love interests in Adam Sandler's early movies.<br/><br/>Fans will attack me for taking the movie too seriously. That's not the case. The problem is that the film mistakes being silly for being funny - like Monty Python minus their brilliant wit. The movie is so focused on being silly that it leaves its brains at the door, and that's the problem: recycled gags, unfunny and repetitive visual jokes and poor acting really sinks this. I suppose in the right hands it could have been a very funny sports parody like ""Dodgeball"" (which managed the balance of wit and silliness far better) but they really missed the mark on this one."

","Will Ferrell is one of my favorite actors rite now, most of his movies are hilarious. However, although I'm not a fan of John Heder because I found Napoleon Dynamite to be a waste of 90 minutes of my life, I can still appreciate his work. I watched this movie, not expecting it to be the funniest movie I have ever seen, but at least expecting a decent comedy. I was completely mistaken. The few laughs one does get out the movie come from Will Ferrel; John Heder only brought the movie down with his predictable and dry jokes. All the jokes are 'played out', nothing original, and nothing you haven't seen and/or heard before - but in all fairness you will get a few laughs out the movie (hence my 3/10 rating rather than 1/10), but not nearly as much as you should considering it is a Will Ferrell comedy. The clichÃ© and uninteresting storyline made the movie even worse - two enemies team up to overcome the odds and work together to win the competition. That's basically the whole story right there. I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching a this movie, when after 20 minutes into it I knew exactly how it would end. I simply hoped to get some laughs, but as it turns out, that hope was in vain.<br/><br/>In the end they fly away together. I still do not understand that. I am not homophobic and I apologize if the following words offend you, but I feel the need to get this off my chest. Not only is it the gayest way possible to end a gay movie about two gay men ice skating together, but it does not make any sense. I am still not sure if the ending was suppose to be funny or dramatic, but I found it to be neither - I found it to be retarded.

","Once again Will Farrel plays a stuck-up ""bad boy"" who wants to prove that he is the best. I waited to see this movie for a few months and I saw this movie on its opening day. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny parts, but overall, this movie was just okay. A lot of their jokes were repetitive, and I only really laughed out loud 2-3 times through out the entire movie. Will Ferrell's performance is similar to that of Ron Burgandy, which is what made his role disappointing. Jon Heder's performance was alright. The performance by newcomer Jenna Fischer is charming. Amy Poehler is great at playing a bitch. She and Will Arnett complement each other's roles nicely. My favorite character was the one played by Nick Swardson. If you see the movie, you'll know why. I think he was the funniest. In my opinion, don't go in with high expectations."

Now I'm not saying that this film is full of witty, clever jokes but, oh my god, it is SO funny. Blades of Glory is unpretentious with its jokes but it hits the nail on the head every time.<br/><br/>The main thing is that the characters by themselves are funny. It's not just one humorous character surrounded by a bunch of normal people.

Nothing is special about Ferrell. NOTHING. His supporters are nothing but a bunch of young, dumb, ignorant, immature losers. That's all they are. It's really sad what kind of garbage we continue to see these days. The state of current comedy is at an all time low right now.

Heder's performance as Napoleon Dynamite will never get old and Ferrell seems to provide laughs no matter the material. For whatever reason though, neither of them are particularly funny in 'Blades of Glory'. This just feels like you average, generic comedy and neither actor really made their role their own.<br/><br/>'Blades of Glory' had the potential to be a comedy classic but instead it's very hit and miss - probably more miss than hit in fact. Far too much of the first half of the film is laugh-free and for a satirical comedy it focuses way too much on storytelling and misses too many opportunities for jokes. Compare it to similar movies like 'Dodgeball' and it's clear that 'Blades of Glory' comes up short.<br/><br/>It could have been great, but 'Blades of Glory' is amusing at best and a big let down overall."

"StevePulaski","6","1","2","6 February 2013"," Light on humor, but heavy on theatrics
","One of the newest things for comedies to satire are activities that have been officially called sports, yet they're activities we can't help but subtly sneer at. Balls of Fury gave ping-pong a quirky satire, The Big Year would go on to showcase the eccentric sport of birding (bird-watching), and Will Speck and Josh Gordon's Blades of Glory gives us a predominately genial, high-spirited comedy on the competitive nature of professional figure-skating. And who better to carry out the challenge than comedian extraordinare Will Ferrell and relative newcomer Jon Heder, still riding off of the Napoleon Dynamite fame three years after its release? What Blades of Glory reminds all of us of is Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, one of Ferrell's previous comedies and, for those who enjoyed that film or whole-heartedly loathed it, could suffer by comparison for better or for worse. For one thing, Blades of Glory provides us with a glossier, more aesthetically attractive atmosphere, concocted off of set-pieces, stunning skate techniques, entertaining theatricalities, and a story of over competitive hatred between two professionals that transcends into bonding and teamwork. On my checklist, that's quite a lot for a satire on figure-skating to include.<br/><br/>The film opens by showing us the 2002 World Winter Sports Games, where we are introduced to the extremely talented and proclaimed sex addict figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) and the equally talented, yet effeminate Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder). Both men get a few minutes to show off their true talent before getting into a huge fight on the ice, leading to their expulsion from figure-skating entirely.<br/><br/>Three and a half years later, Jimmy works at a sporting goods store, while Chazz, who has gained weight and become even more addicted on alcohol and sex. It would appear that their lives, now well past the line of obscurity, will continue to spiral in the downward direction, until an obsessed fan (Nick Swardson) informs Jimmy that he was only banned from individual skating and not from pair skating, thanks to a contract loophole. Jimmy nabs his old coach Robert (Craig T. Nelson), who gets him Chazz as a last minute partner so he can compete.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film centers on Chazz and Jimmy training for the big championship in figure-skating, with intentions to beat Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), the brother and sister pair who have become increasingly cunning and manipulative in their desire to win.<br/><br/>One of the most pleasing additions to Blades of Glory is its surprising lack of humor targeted at homosexuals. Don't misread that sentence, for it's still present, mainly toward s the clean and slightly feminine Jimmy. But with homosexuality bearing a notable presence in the figure-skating world, it's nice to see the film not take the easy way out and go for the unfairly-achieved gold.<br/><br/>Blades of Glory is about as good as a satire about figure-skating can be. The jokes are largely hit or miss, the performers are capable, if a tad uneven, and the direction by Speck and Gordon is at least efficient enough to take seriously. This isn't likely to go down in the books as a satire of epic proportions, but as far as slapstick, goofball comedies go, it's smart enough and snappy enough to show you a more earnest good time.<br/><br/>Starring: Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, Craig T. Nelson, William Fichtner, Jenna Fischer, and Romany Malco. Directed by: Will Speck and Josh Gordon."

","So they decided to do a movie on figure skating since most of the other sports movies has been taken up. And I must say, as stupid as this movie is, it was sort of entertaining to some degree and is at least watchable. The premise is about 2 whinny figure skaters that get kicked out of ever competing after a incident and now has to work together in order to make there comeback as a double. The mainly most of the movie is about 2 whiny guys having to work with each other, while there other rivals are planning to sabotage there hard work in order to take the gold. Sound familiar right? Well it's cause it's a pretty generic flick, with some gay jokes thrown in. Ferrell and Heder work together alright, they basically reprise the same roles they do in there other movies. It's stupid, but watchable although you won't gain anything from it besides few cheap laughs. Rental at best.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Floated2","2","1","2","6 September 2009"," It seriously wasn't funny
","The movie was so stupid and wasn't funny in the least bit. Jon Heder's 15 minutes of fame expired a long time ago and this movie proves it. Maybe if the frat pack was cast it may have been more entertaining, but the plot script and Heder ruined the film. I wonder why Owen Wilson wasn't cast as Jimmy, I think he would have had a better performance compared to Heder. The movie is short, not funny and this could be one of Will Ferrell's worst performances. Seriously, I had high hopes before watching this movie because a few of my pals told me they loved it. The expectations were never met, this movie is garbage. As a Will Ferrell fan I would hate to see his career end on a low note, and hopefully the next roles he chooses will be funny and the plot will be much more interesting. There were too many sex references in this movie and more curing than expected. The film was way too predictable and we have seen this same plot happen many times.<br/><br/>If this movie was ""R rated"", i think it would have been MUCH better and funny. Think about it, had they threw in F-bombs and more sexual content, it would have been better (look at Semi-Pro, now imagine it without the F-bombs and ""R rating"". This film was terrible save your time and see something else or rent a frat pack comedy if you're in a Will Ferrell mood!"
"jonathan-577","8","1","2","25 January 2009"," (crotch) in-your-face humour
","I'm thinking this is my favourite of the four Will Ferrell comedies I've seen - no received nostalgia or Halliburton cameos to disrupt the high-concept laffs. Jon Heder can't really match Ferrell mug for mug, but both serve a burlesque of homosexual panic so broad and overt that I can only imagine how it played in theatres. Ferrell is really walking an impressively sustained tightrope with his embattled masculinity routine, and he keeps finding new angles with each project. Arnett and Poehler are great in support - check out their JFK-Marilyn routine. As usual, this peaks in the second act, when things are going badly; can't beat the ice capades shtick. But it sustains to the end; my roomie looked out in bewilderment at what all this hysterical laughter was about."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","1","2","28 September 2008"," A good, underrated, sports comedy
","""Blades of Glory"" tells the unlikely story of a pair of arch-rival figure skaters, banned from singles competition, who join forces to exploit a loophole in the rules. As you might expect, this skating odd couple is confronted with numerous comical situations on their way to Olympic glory.<br/><br/>Like any successful comedy, this one has a well-assembled cast. Will Ferrell & Jon Heder make a good team and play off each other nicely. The requisite 'bad guys' are portrayed with relish by Will Arnett & Amy Poehler. Unfortunately, Jenna Fischer, in the romantic interest role, fails to maintain the high standard established by the rest of the stars. Well, at least we have Craig T. Nelson turning back the clock to his days on ""Coach"" and a few other notables in small roles (William Fichtner, Rob Corddry, etc...).<br/><br/>The story unsurprisingly follows the usual sports arc, that being: team isn't so good, team practices while bonding and, finally, team competes once again 'for all the marbles'. Thankfully, the laughs come steadily enough that the bare-bones plot is a non-issue. I did find it satisfying overall, though the over the top finale was a tad too unrealistic for my tastes. Not that what preceded it was exactly realistic but at least it adhered to the laws of physics.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint the film is merely average, which is fine for a comedy since the performances should carry the picture. The skating scenes look passable but the actors are obviously restricted somewhat by their actual skill in that area. The soundtrack is fairly well chosen and the end credits feature a stereotypically earnest title song sung by Bo Bice.<br/><br/>I think that with a few small tweaks this film could have been a modern comedy classic. As it is, it's an enjoyable (though ultimately forgettable) romp that deserves better than the 6.6 IMDb rating that it has at the time of my writing."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","1","2","22 September 2008"," Not the most consistent comedy I've ever seen, but still a reasonably satisfying farce
","I guess I first found out about this 2007 comedy while watching TV, either while it was playing in theatres or shortly before, and it seemed like a movie I would want to see, since I knew it starred comedian Will Ferrell, along with Jon Heder, who rocketed to fame with his starring role in the 2004 hit teen comedy, ""Napoleon Dynamite"", both of whom had previously made me laugh. However, it took me a while to get around to watching it, I don't know exactly why. It wasn't until the last time I went out to rent movies, just a couple days ago, when this was one of the films I picked out (knowing I wanted to beforehand), and while it wasn't as consistent as I could have possibly hoped for, I definitely laughed.<br/><br/>Sex-obsessed, arrogant Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) are two very talented figure skaters, but very different ones. Jimmy is very exact, whereas Chazz likes to improvise, and their personalities are very different as well. These two compete in men's singles skating and end up tied with the gold medal! Unfortunately, while on the medal platform, the two get into a fist fight, and as a result, they are stripped of their medals and banned from men's figure skating for life! Three and a half years later, they both have different jobs, and don't live the happiest lives, but Jimmy is informed that he has only been banned from singles skating, and can still participate in pair competitions! So, he goes to search for a partner, and he and his past rival soon meet again! After another fist fight, Jimmy's coach sees potential in the two, and manages to pair them up and begin to train them to be the first male/male figure skating pair! However, conflict between the two continues, and it doesn't help that two rivals, Stranz and Fairchild van Waldenberg, a champion figure skating pair, are willing to play mean tricks to ruin the male/male pair's hopes of winning!<br/><br/>You can be sure this is a silly comedy, crude at times (which is why it's rated PG-13), not that I'm complaining. My main complaint is that it's not as consistently funny as it could have been. Other than that, I don't have too many complaints. The fist fights (as well as some verbal conflict between the two lead characters), Chazz's job in the children's skating play, ""Grublets on Ice"", playing the ""Evil Wizard,"" what he does when he appears in the play drunk one time, and Chazz calling Jimmy and singing his own rendition of Aerosmith's 1998 hit, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"", in his umpteenth attempt to get him to call back, were all highlights for me when it comes to humour. The film is only occasionally hilarious, but when it's not, it's often still amusing, to varying degrees, and sometimes maybe not at all. Will Ferrell is usually humorous in the film (though his many haters would likely disagree), and Jon Heder provides laughs at times as well, playing a character that resembles his most famous one. The two main characters are both likable. Lastly, towards the end, the film gets exciting as it gets to the climax. So, if you're a fan of Will Ferrell and/or ""Napoleon Dynamite"", while ""Blades of Glory"" may not be a classic, you could easily still find yourself laughing."
"MartinHafer","8","1","2","7 September 2008"," Totally stupid--and I liked it!!
","BLADES OF GLORY seems like a natural follow-up to Will Farrell's TALLADEGA NIGHTS, as its spirit and silliness are sure reminiscent of this wonderful comedy. However, here the setting is ice skating and Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite"") is also the co-star.<br/><br/>The film begins with Heder and Farrell tying for the gold medal in the world championship that is obviously supposed to be the Olympics. However, the Olympics are an extremely litigious organization and would have sued the studio for every penny they could get, so the Olympic trademark rings were changed and the word ""Olympics"" never were uttered in the film. Despite both men winning the men's individual gold, however, they were bitter rivals and began a hilarious fight on the podium--with horribly unexpected results. In retaliation, the men are stripped of their medals and banned from Men's Figure Skating. However, later they learn that this did NOT mean that they could not compete in pairs and they men create the most unusual skating team in history!! Now before you read on, it's very, very important that if you see the film you are the type person who can suspend disbelief. Sure, the moves they make aren't legal, two guys are NOT allowed to skate in pairs skating and the film is chock-full of impossibilities....and don't even get me started on the ending!! The bottom line is that if you are a nit-picking twit, you'll drive yourself crazy making sense of the impossibilities in the movie. My advice is to resist this urge strongly and just sit back and enjoy. The film is hilarious and it's amazing to see Farrell and Heder skate as well as they did (though it's obvious that some CGI was used--believe me, NO ONE could do much of what was done in the film!).<br/><br/>Original and exceptionally silly and stupid, this is a great ""turn off your brain and enjoy"" sort of film (much like TALLADEGA NIGHTS). While I often like very cerebral films and art films, sometimes I just need a liberal does of stupid and fun and this film fits the bill very nicely."

","If you haven't seen The Cutting Edge (a great film and probably the best figure-skating film of all time), or are not a professional figure skater (or someone close to one), you'll miss a lot of subtle humor in this film. As it says in the trivia section, the ""Iron Lotus"" trick in the film was based on the Pamchencko from The Cutting Edge, and is in fact the same trick. This parody doesn't stop there, however, as I felt like I was watching an alternate-universe version of The Cutting Edge, written by someone with a penchant for sick-comedy.<br/><br/>What makes this parody work is that it parodies both the sport and its inspiration film equally. The bluerint for the two films is almost identical: prima-donna skater (John Heder as Jimmy/""Kate"") suffers bad break at the same olympics as nuts-and-bolts skater (Will Farrell as Chazz Michael Michaels/""Doug""). Jimmy's failure causes his overbearing ""father"" to disown him, but then, a partner is finally found for the pairs, while Jimmy's crazy coach (Craig T. Nelson as Coach/""Pamchenko"") nurses along the love-hate relationship between the two protagonists against an evil pair of sport royalty (the von Waldenbergs/""Peckarovskis"").<br/><br/>As in The Cutting Edge, the skaters are tempted to sleep with the enemy, in this case ""Katie"" von Waldenberg, the sister of the rival team. An evil plot is hatched (this time from the opponents rather than the judges) to keep the leads off the medal podium, and part of stopping the plot is Coach's infamous ""iron lotus"" move, which in this movie had been tried once before, with much more predictable and hilarious results. A subtle beauty of this film is that you realize just how much this is based on The Cutting Edge only after you see the iron lotus.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote this film either really loves or really hates figure skating, probably a bit of both, but also left no stone unturned int parodying a sport that needs to be parodied, and a film that was way better than the critics ever realized. I would love to have been in the room when D.b. Sweeney and Moira Kelly were watching this film. My guess is they wouldn't have stopped laughing once.<br/><br/>What is perhaps most amazing to me is that while I activeily dislike almost every actor in this film, each of them stayed true to the material, allowed it to be the star, nad was bearable in their ""supporting"" role. So was the film."
"MLDinTN","7","1","2","23 March 2008"," the dirty side of figure skating
","This movie exploits the dirty side of figure skating so to speak. It's entertaining and amusing. Not a great comedy, but certainly good enough. Will Ferrell plays his usual character stereotype. Jon Heder plays Jimmy, the rival to Ferrell's Chazz. Both get kicked out of men's figure skating after a funny series of events. They both get loser jobs. Jimmy's coach comes back into the picture, and they come up with the idea of pairs skating. Jimmy can't find a girl in time, so he takes Chazz as a partner. Of course, hijinks ensue, since the two can't stand each other. The Van Waldenberg's are the leaders in pairs figure skating and they do all they can to sabotage Chazz and Jimmy. The funniest scene of the movie is when Jimmy calls Katie to ask her out for a snow cone. Chazz tells Jimmy what to say and Katie's brother and sister tell her what to say. That was so funny.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This movie is like any Will Ferrell movie, so if you like his other films, you will like this one."

The constant battling of Ferrell and Heder over the minor issues of partnership (bunkbeds, sink space, manliness etc) were filled with amazing, seemingly improvised, lines! The chase scene was a masterpiece (listen for the hostage line!).<br/><br/>However, I asked the guys who I was with what they thought, and they said ""It was OK. Not as good as Anchorman"". That's were B.O.G's problem lies. The curse of Ferrell, making a darn good film seem tame, as viewers everywhere say ""Anchorman was better"". Is this excellent film forever going to be overlooked.

","I'm a fan of Will Ferrell and John Heder, and the mere idea of the two as disgraced rival ice-skaters forced to team up and compete as a pair made me grin like an idiot. But would the film be as funny as the concept?<br/><br/>Well, whilst it might not be a perfect 6.0, the comedic duo definitely go for gold, putting in a couple of terrific performances that get a winning score from this judge (I'm giving it 9 out of 10 on IMDb).<br/><br/>Ferrell is sex addict super-stud skater Chazz Michael Michaels; Heder is his spoilt, effeminate rival Jimmy MacElroy. When the two are awarded joint Gold in the Olympics, they begin a fight which results in them being stripped of their medals and banned from men's singles figurative skating... for life!<br/><br/>However, several years later, they become aware of a loophole in the skating rules which allows them to take part in world competition once more... as a pairs team. Together, they attempt to win gold once more, taking on the Waldenbergs, a brother and sister pair whose suggestive (and somewhat incestuous) ice dancing makes Ferrell and Heder's routines seem almost normal in comparison.<br/><br/>From the moment that Heder takes to the ice, resplendent in his sequined Peacock costume, this film is a relentlessly funny, gag-fest that, whilst perhaps not quite reaching the greatness of Anchorman, is certainly on a par with Ferrell's Talladega Nights and slightly better than, although not quite as quotable as, Heder's Napolean Dynamite.<br/><br/>Sure, there is no denying that Blades of Glory is low-brow, OTT (and some might even say homophobic) humour, and it will not be to everyone's taste, but fans of dumb comedy (think along the lines of Benchwarmers, Zoolander or Dodgeball) should find this movie hilarious.<br/><br/>And even though cinematic comedy is very subjectiveone man's Chevy Chase is another man's Pauly ShoreI defy even the most pretentious film-lover not to crack a smile at the sight of Ferrell and Heder, with face in each other's groin, performing their 'fire and ice' routine.<br/><br/>Go on, admit it... it's making you chuckle just thinking about it."

From the skaters'outfits to their choreography, everything was consistently funny. <br/><br/>Will Farrell's characters can sometimes be a bit annoying, but in this film he was kept in check by a pair of directors who knew how to best channel his talents. There were a few times when Jon Heder seemed a bit like Napoleon Dynamite, but he usually held on to his new persona pretty well. <br/><br/>Overall, this is the best comedy I've seen in years."
"jameselford","7","1","2","30 August 2007"," Ice to see.
","You know exactly what to expect when you walk into a Will Ferrell film, and Blades of Glory is no exception.<br/><br/>Weird, slightly askew jokes? Check. Will Ferrell walking around in his Y-fronts? Check. An underdog taking on the world (with the occasional beer in his hand?) Check. A sex drive that seems slightly frightening? Check.<br/><br/>Blades dishes out this familiar recipe in spades, which to my mind can only be a good thing. After all Will Ferrell is a comedy genius. Proof: he has no humility. This is the same guy who ran through the streets butt-naked in Old School. In this film, he shows no fear wearing very tight spandex suits whilst slicing the ice. And admitting his sex addiction. ""It's my cross to bear."" Yet with all these loopy goings-on he shows no hint of ""yeah, I know, I'm FUNNY."" A brilliant showman, and one who despite his one-joke appearance, continually surprises us with his ability to make a show of himself. That does take skill.<br/><br/>Jon Heder annoyed the hell out of me in Napoleon Dynamite (but then, so did the film.) In this he's actually very likable. Yes, he's relegated to the role of sidekick (but then he doesn't make 20 million a film...) but plays the character true whilst still maintaining a certain level of weirdness (the flowing blond hair is just disturbing on so many levels.)<br/><br/>Craig T Nelson, where have you been all my life? I love this guy. he brings such a sober style of comedy to the film. He plays it straight-faced all the time, and yet I cracked up every time he showed. Yes, he plays the same kind of role that Rip Torn played in Dodgeball (plus there's many similarities between the two, but more of that later). But he's just such a cool actor that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. When God laughs, it's because he watches them. they are the greatest comedy duo in a long while. So dry. If you're a fan of Arrested Development, you'll recognise Arnett as the egocentric GOB, and Poehler as his random wife. They're married in real life. In this, they're brother and sister...with slight intimacy issues. To say more would spoil the little moments that litter this film with giggles.<br/><br/>All in all a great film.<br/><br/>Upside: Funny cast, no-brainer plot line. Downside: A little too long, the ending???<br/><br/>Overall: See it if you're a stoner/need a giggle/love Ferrell."

","I laughed, true, but I think it was only a half step above a Sat. Night Live skit (It's no Bad Santa for sure). <br/><br/>BUUTT, that being said, Will Ferrell does pump out some good lines. My favorite was definitely this; When he was trading insults with Jon Heder's character after not seeing him for a few years... Jimmy (Jon Heder): ""I See you got fat."" Chaz (Will Ferrell): ""I see you still look like a 15 year old girl ... but not hot!"".<br/><br/>And what makes it funny is that it's true. Jon Heder does look very femme bottom. I hope they paid him well cause that role ain't doing nothing to win him street cred. Talk about destroying what he got with Napoleon Dynamite. <br/><br/>That was like the worst role ever. Like anybody could even know that. Gosh."
"ExpendableMan","8","1","2","17 August 2007"," Great stuff, Ferrell hits all moves
","Thus far, if you look at his career, you can plainly see that Will Ferrell has largely appeared in two sorts of movies: those where he's given free reign, and those where he has to prop up the movie and stick rigidly to a script. Examples of the former would of course be Anchorman and Talladega Nights, both of them riotously enjoyable comedies where his improv skills go to town. Examples of the latter would be Bewitched, or The Producers, hardly films to write home about. It is a tremendous relief to say therefore that Blades of Glory, despite seemingly being knocked together very quickly after the wicked one-two punch of Talladega and the pigeon-hole evading Stranger Than Fiction, is just as funny as any other classic Ferrell film you can name and rightly deserves its place on his CV.<br/><br/>Of course, anyone who's familiar with his best work will find few surprises in the character of Chazz Michael Michaels, a pompous, sex-addicted figure skating champion who might as well be Ron Burgundy in a leotard, but when the film is this funny it's hard to complain. Just witness the montage sequence where Chazz keeps ringing his friend Jimmy's mobile phone, leaving increasingly stupid answer phone messages through the course of the night. Or the bad-taste but deliriously funny sequence where he visits a sex therapy group (complete with Luke Wilson cameo). It might not be much of a stretch, but he sure makes one hilarious ice-devouring sex tornado.<br/><br/>However, this isn't just a one man show and equally impressive is John Heder as rival-skater-turned-partner Jimmy MacElroy; a naive and idealistic foil to Michael's brash egotism. Heder plays Jimmy with just the right amount of innocence and awkwardness but somehow manages to avoid many similarities with a certain Idaho dwelling nerd. To his eternal credit, Heder isn't overwhelmed by Ferrell on screen either and the two's burgeoning friendship forms the basis of a lot of the laughs, as they share a natural camaraderie not unlike that which Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson handled so well in Wedding Crashers.<br/><br/>Backing them up is a reliable supporting cast of comedy regulars. Will Arnett appears alongside his wife Amy Poehler as a brother & sister skating team who share a disturbing, incestuous relationship that is even more ridiculous than the leads. Craig T. Nelson plays it straight faced as the stern, no-nonsense coach and even Romany Malco from the 40 Year Old Virgin appears for a brief role. Best of all though is Nick Swardson as Jimmy's obsessed stalker Hector, worshipping his hero by sending him cups of blood and promising to kill him one day. Furthermore, the set pieces come thick and fast, from the outlandishly homo-erotic skating scenes to a strong contender for cinema's most ridiculous chase sequence.<br/><br/>You could easily argue that playing the same character over and over again will eventually do more harm than good, but for those of us who still regularly quote Anchorman, Blades of Glory is a triumph. It's relentlessly stupid, packed with memorable dialogue and is another feather in the cap for Ferrell. More please."

","I'm not generally into overly silly comedies but for some reason I loved this movie. I laughed pretty much all the way through in spite of the fact that if you deconstructed it has many components of a bad movie.<br/><br/>It has a predictable plot, clichéd characters, low brow humour. However it somehow balances out these faults, though it is hard to say how.<br/><br/>If I were to attempt to say why it wasn't bad I'd say: It is well paced. It doesn't try to be anything than what it is - a lot of comedies these days suddenly try to be serious like they are embarrassed to be ""just"" a comedy. At the points at which it is in danger of turning soppy it maintains the comedy unlike the Wedding Crashers (which I enjoyed none-the-less but it did slow it down). It doesn't have any annoying ""forth wall"" breaking that brings you out of the movie. There is also comedy going on in the background that you might miss (for example some of the stuff the commentators say).<br/><br/>It manages to make the main characters sympathetic although they definitely don't start out that way. Movie clichés are tweaked just enough to make them fresh and funny.<br/><br/>Some have made the comment that they think the movie is homophobic. Personally I think that says more about them and society's stereotypes than the movie makers. It is NOT making fun of homosexuals at all but rather people's reaction to homoerotisism. If you are a offended by it is probably a sign that you are homophobic yourself. There is a difference between camp and gay, if you don't get that you won't get why it isn't homophobic.<br/><br/>All that being said I wouldn't recommend analyzing this movie into oblivion while you are sitting there. Just sit back and relax."

","It's no Anchorman or Napolean D. However it has some decent moments and some great uncomfortable moments that Ferrell movies are famous for.

With that being said, you always know that you are in for at least a decent time whenever you watch a movie starring Willie F. I think this movie is best suited for a night at the college dorm or kicking back with buddies over a few brew-ski's. It's humour that young adults are used to and can appreciate but it is nothing profound or new. For that reason I'll give it a 6. Good for cheap, easy laughs and again, there is nothing wrong with the picture minus the predictability. Watch it on a lazy night if you're in the mood for a comedy, but my best guess is that two months after you see it, won't be something that sticks with you and your friends won't be quoting it.

"Listen_to_the_Law","4","1","2","15 April 2007"," Yet another miss for Will Ferrell
","Why have I blindly ventured off into another movie starring the groan-inducing king, Will Ferrell? Could it be stupidity, or just unintelligent curiosity to see if I may've been too hard on Talladega Nights? Looking back, I'd have to say both. Before the movie, I tried to erase any past bad feelings I had toward Ferrell and his anti-laugh style, and for a few minutes it worked. But after a while, it was the same ol' garbage lines and dumb character that he plays in just about every other movie he stars in. Now I'm not saying Will Ferrell is bad- I'm just saying that I can not stand him. I can see how some may get too much of a kick out of him, but to me, he's just an immature loudmouth who must certainly carry a large ego because he never feels the need to alter the character he plays.<br/><br/>Focusing on the positives nowone of the better parts to the movie has to be Jon Heder, who plays male ice skater Jimmy MacElroy. Heder has shown major career improvement and ""evolution,"" if you can call it that. Many of the few funny parts from Blades of Glory happen solely because of Heder. Ferrell, on the other hand, is Chazz Michael Michaels, a man who is ""sex on ice"" and wants everyone to know that he is a ""sex addict who loves females."" Those parts, when spoken in the movie, are minor laugh-riots. However, minus those few lines, Ferrell just doesn't make me laugh at all. In fact, he one-ups that statement: he actually makes me mad- mad because of that damn ego that is always shining through his body, or in Blades' case, his spandex (yuck, by the way, but that's a whole other topic that I will not be addressing).<br/><br/>Besides Jon Heder's fairly good performance, the storyline and idea in Blades of Glory is intriguing. When I saw the trailer, I was mildly amused, and since I can see an infinite amount of movies for free, I figured I'd go see it. Now, this being a comedy, the storyline is not supposed to be the main attraction. To me it was: the soap opera aura that was floating around Ferrell and Heder and their cheating rivals was interesting, as was the end chase between Ferrell and the cheating husband. That is until Ferrell opened his mouth.<br/><br/>I thought to myself through the parts that I didn't appreciate if the situations in Blades would be funny if they were really occurring, like in real life. I came to the conclusion that in real life, these situations may be funny, but the movie made it so unrealistic that it had no hope for capitalizing on that ideal outcome. So don't blame me for not enjoying Blades of Glory, because I tried to. -Nick Harvey<br/><br/>Good) Heder does fairly well, idea is OK Bad) Ferrell: never understood him, probably never will Sex Innuendos) Just flat out horrible, along with all the groin jokes"

A few laughs which actually are funny but most of the jokes are pretty rubbish.<br/><br/>If your skating fan then your bound to recognise lots of people in this film (and will have no clue who the hell they are if, like me you aren't a skating fan) but I think skating fans will truly hate this.<br/><br/>Ferrall actually manages to make himself bearable for 90% of this film. Jon Heder, better known as Napoleon Dynamite brings nothing to his role and is there on name value alone. He plays the role sounding and acting like Napoleon Dynamite. <br/><br/>He could have at least tried to change his voice a little. Ferrall plays the same role he's played in every movie he's ever been in but has obviously been reigned in by either the writer, producer or director as he isn't as much of an asshole or idiot as he usually is and he actually managed to make me laugh (once, during the entire film).<br/><br/>The film isn't really all that funny, it's a case of disengage brain and watch. Forget the fact that 2 men would never be allowed to compete like this, forget that they would most likely have to qualify to even appear in their 1st event that got them to the winter sport games.<br/><br/>The ending (where they fly out of the arena) totally ruined the entire film, making a mildly bearable film totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>Will Ferrall fans will love it."
"dave9211","8","1","2","9 April 2007"," Will Farrell gets gold again
","I have seen a few Will Farrell movies and enjoyed them all. 'Blades of Glory' is one of the best! It tells the story of two male figure skaters who are banned from skating, after a few years they decide to team up and compete together as a pair. As the films unfolds the audience see a transition in the characters from being competitors (the fight scenes are some of the funniest) to becoming friends.<br/><br/>Will Farrell (Old School) is always consistent when it comes to comedy I cant say he's bad in anything, but sometimes runs the risk of repeating his characters in films. He plays Chazz Michael Michaels in 'Blades' and is not too far from Ron Burgundy in 'Anchorman', but it's easily forgiven, as character and film are classics!<br/><br/>Relative newcomer, Jon Heder, starred in the cult film 'Napoleon Dynamite'. He proves strong against Farrell and defiantly proves himself, although still being slightly similar Napoleon in this film. Both are geeky, stupid characters manage to have the audiences in stitches.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are the interactions between the two leads. They work fantastically well together, whether it's the skating or the fighting (the opening with Jimmy skating was hilarious). The film sometimes does fall into the same trap as other Farrell movies, same humour, cameos from other actors and characteristics but its forgivable as Farrell always makes them watchable and entertaining.<br/><br/>While I loved 'Anchorman', 'Blades' could possibly be up there with it! And is without a doubt the best film I've seen this year."

","Because men don't know how to bond anymore...<br/><br/>You know it's a funny world when the movie with the strongest message for its audience disguises that message so brilliantly, its stupid.<br/><br/>Blades of Glory, the story of two male rivals who become two pair skaters, is not that funny, the film is ludicrously generic, the script weak, the laughs thin (but they are there) BUT it works well as what it is: farce. Ice Skating is, obviously, a bizarre enough sport already and yes there is enough Lycra body suits to make you feel queasy -so the script goes for a healthy dose of testosterone in Ferrell's performance. I felt Ferrell performance was heading towards nonchalant and lacked the spot-on timing that made Talladega shine. Jon Heder is more on point but his character lacks a little.<br/><br/>Jon Heder's Jimmy MacElroy is the artistic, shy teenager type, and so, of course, falls for the younger sister of the pairs' arch-rivals the bizarrely close sibling team that are the Van Waldenbergs - a sweet and fine role by The Office's Jenna Fischer, who I predict is a future star and will turn better and better - and Will Ferrell the sex-addict macho man who learns that he doesn't walk alone.<br/><br/>My major criticism is the utter predictablitility of the plot: it feels like going out to buy new trainers, getting home , opening the box, and discovering your old trainers are in there. Guys, please don't just keep on repeating a winning formula - hero falls, journeys, retrains, discovers values, wins - over and over again: the hero plot needs some serious workover if this is the best that it can do...<br/><br/>BUT it works for this simple reason: it does what the Western did in the 50s, or buddy movies did in the 70s, or hero and sidekick movies did: it shouts men who can be themselves and be mean ""without the gayness"" as Will Ferrell's Chazz MIchael Michaels would no doubt state. In a world where men are not allowed to be men (And ice skating must be the pinnacle of all such worlds) Blades of Glory is pretty much a great movie about how men can do what women do naturally - like each other - and still be men, and remain straight, cos straight men can bond too.<br/><br/>All this subtext is disguised on a morass of stupid, and mainly, sorry, lame humor - but if you're in the right mood it works: the achievement is that the two keep it all silly enough - and it requires no brain cells to sit back and watch - it just fails to really elevate the film to a better level by never quite capturing it title - the sport aspects of skating are not as thrilling as Nascar - these blades of glory are simply not sharp enough for greatness..."

","All I wanted was for this movie to make me laugh, and I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. I found it to be surprisingly funny, much more so than Ferrell's 'Talladega Nights' last summer. 'Blades of Glory' is along the same comedic path as 'Zoolander,' where-as to arch rivals in a highly overrated and highly effeminate sport/profession must set aside their differences and make nice with highly entertaining results. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder make a perfectly miss-matched comedic pair. I was afraid Heder would be highly over shadowed by a comedic veteran like Ferrell, but together they make the movie work, each with vastly different styles of comedy that in the end compliment each other well. I would recommend this movie if you are sick to death of films like 'Norbit' littering our theatres and just want to genuinely laugh at a movie that intends to be silly and is successful in doing so."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","1","2","1 April 2007"," Perfect Pair
","In ""Blades of Glory"" Will Ferrell and Jon Heder boldly go where no men have gone before: the world of competitive pairs figure skating. Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck's ""Blades of Glory"" on the surface does not appear to be a big budget movie, but it delivers the big laughs in a stupid funny movie that is just plain funny. ""Blades of Glory"" is hysterical. No one does straight brazenly stupid like Will Ferrell. As figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels, whose tag is ""Sex on Ice"", Ferrell takes no prisoners. Jon Heder as rival figure skater Jimmy MacElroy, is the perfect straight-man. Amazingly, Ferrell and Heder are true comedic partners. ""Blades of Glory"" works, because Ferrell and Heder play it straight up. One does not try to out funny the other. Instead they play their roles in earnest, and let the screenplay by Jeff Cox and Craig Cox generate the laughs. This figure skating parody may lack some of the bite of the ""Talladega Nights"" take on NASCAR. However, ""Blades of Glory"" provides a breeze of authenticity with appearances by Scott Hamilton, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, and Brian Boitano. Confessed sex addict Chazz (Ferrell) even makes an outrageous pass at Nancy Kerrigan.<br/><br/>Ferrell and Heder play arch rival figure skaters Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy. Chazz is the skating outlaw and sex symbol on ice. Jimmy is the distinctively sensitive orphan child prodigy. Following a ridiculous awards brawl after tying for Olympic Gold, Chazz and Jimmy are banned from Men's Singles competition for life. Three and a half years later, Jimmy's Coach (Craig T. Nelson) discovers a loop hole in the ban. The lifetime ban does not apply to pairs figure skating competition. Therefore, Chazz and Jimmy make history and the tabloids as the first ever male-male pairs team. Coach inspires his men that as a male-male pairs team they can risk moves that other mixed pairs can'tincluding his ""Iron Lotus"" death spiral. Chazz and Jimmy challenge the reign of pairs champions Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), an eerie brother and sister duo. Innocent Jimmy is smitten by the Van Waldenberg's younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer). Thus, the stage is set. Can Chazz and Jimmy overcome their egos and determine who the dude of the pair is? Can Coach inspire his men to reclaim their past greatness? And is there no limit to the ruthlessness of the Van Waldenbergs? Well, ""Blades of Glory"" is predictable to its soul. However, it is also refreshingly funny. There are groin jokes, and there are more groin jokes.<br/><br/>Most of the humor comes from perfect casting of the characters. Will Ferrell's Chazz is so shamelessly stupid and arrogant; one need only applaud and admire. Ferrell's gift is that he stays in character throughout, oblivious to how funny he is. He and Heder have great chemistry. They have a hilarious scene where Chazz describes the origin of his tattoos. Jon Heder is a surprise. He actually fleshes out the sensitive Jimmy as a charming innocent. His relationship with Katie (Jenna Fischer) is humorously sweet and awkward. Fischer is also great as Katie, an unwilling pawn of the Van Waldenbergs. Craig T. Nelson is awesome. He provides a surreal and ridiculous authority. The only weakness may be Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler). Though likely more an artifact of the story, Stranz and Fairchild are inept and evil without posing any real comedic threat. Arnett and Poehler are funny, but in a one note fashion.<br/><br/>As ridiculous as the skating scenes are, they land with artistry and style. Gordon and Speck orchestrate the ice with skill. The sliding ""scissors"" move by Chazz and Jimmy had me laughing so hard I couldn't breath. The training scenes with Chazz and Jimmy are hysterical. ""Blades of Glory"" gets high marks for degrees of over the top, and certainly for delivering the big laughs."

","This was a huge improvement over the disappointing Talladega Nights. Don't get me wrong, Talladega Nights was a good movie, but very inferior to the masterpiece known as Anchorman. Like Anchorman was just so witty, Talladega Nights tried to do what Anchorman did (almost with the exact same plot, except with Nascar in Talladega, it wasn't the most original and it just was not as funny). Blades of Glory is not the most original plot or that far from the plot of Anchorman (Ferrell being caught up in his ridiculous ego, failing, and then making a comeback) but it takes it to a new level. They kind of use the same mold but twist it so it is not so much original but where when you're watching the movie, you cannot notice the similarities so much. It is a similar plot but a totally different ballgame. Also, Ferrell uses the same style of humor that he used in SNL. I just felt he was pulling more of his old tricks than trying to be funnier than the previous movie he was in. To make a long story short, the trailer to this movie really gives it no justice. It might look stupid but really is a fun way to spend an hour and a half of your life."
"diac228","7","1","2","1 April 2007"," Huh? This movie is sweet? Heder is actually funny? There is more than just catchy one-liners here? Surprise, surprise
","Don't look now, but we have another surprisingly funny movie here. While the formula remains the same, Blades of Glory succeeds with more than just Ferrell's ability to improvise. We have a decent script full of creative gags, plot turns, and content that does not involve our poster boy in the picture. This movie is full of surprises, as it is surprisingly sweet, surprisingly smart, and surprisingly violent. Jon Heder is actually bearable this time, and with a nice supporting cast; Blades of Glory is not as quotable, but just as complete a picture as previous Ferrell films (Might have to do with Ben Stiller producing this one). Besides, any movie that can make figure skating remotely interesting deserves some special praise.<br/><br/>Blades of Glory is about two figure skaters, Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder), banned from men's figure skating for life after a melee erupts following a tie. However, years later it is discovered that they can skate again, but as a pair in doubles competition. Because of their miserable status at the time, the two try to reconcile and get along and be able to compete. With the help of an old coach (Craig T. Nelson), the former rivals try to win the gold by working as a couple. However, there is a brother-sister skating duo (Will Arnett and Amy Poeheler) that does not approve of their comeback attempt.<br/><br/>Ferrell and Heder make a decent comedy team, but it is Ferrell and his barrage of one-liners that once again steals the thunder and the entire film from everyone else involved. His presence alone is funny, and almost everything that comes out of his mouth is a stupid and quotable line. Heder has been rather afraid of branching out to different roles since his breakthrough role as Napoleon Dynamite. However, his best talent, which is his dance movements, comes through here as he portrays a very sensitive, artsy, and flamboyant figure skater. He actually does a good job here, which is quite a shock considering recent efforts. A delightful supporting cast is there for more than just star power--Arnett, Poeheler, Nelson, and the adorably sweet Jenna Fischer (The Office) do great in their roles.<br/><br/>Unlike other (especially recent) comedic vehicles, it's more than just dialogue and cameos running the show. With good skating choreography, great writing, and funny long-lasting gags, Blades of Glory successfully separates itself from other Ferell movies like Anchorman and Talladega Nights. The long fun gags include an ice skate chase that escalates way beyond the ice, a disgusting way to recover a key, the running joke of the homoeroticism with the sport, and a forbidden skate move that has rather strong consequences. The technical aspects of Blades of Glory are a mixed bag. Some of the special effects are good, but other times its obvious and laughably fake. The direction (Josh Gordon, Will Speck) is at times good, and then at other times lacks energy. Finally however, the editing was spot-on, as the movie never drags and remains at a respectable running time of 93 minutes, despite the slew of hit-and-miss jokes.<br/><br/>Of course, while it is Ferrell's best in a long time, it's not without its flaws. The hit-to-miss joke ratio is better than before, but still could use some improvement. For example, every ten attempts at humor, it succeeds six to seven times. Some of the misses are a bit gut wrenching however, especially that of an obsessed fan. The other problem is, if you do not like Ferrell, then there is no way this film will change your mind. Ferell plays the same character as in his previous works, except a lot more sex-driven and much more vulgar. There is nothing really new here, just a different environment and with a better script. Don't come in here expecting a totally different Will Ferrell.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Despite its flaws, Blades of Glory is another fun film from funnyman (say those previous four words ten times fast) Will Ferrell, but this time we have a better cast and better men behind the camera. The improvising still exists, but nowhere near as much as before. With a nice blend of stupid humor and physical humor and also a hint of shock value, Blades of Glory is arguably the best ice skating comedy we've ever seen. Come to think of it however, it might be the only ice skating comedy out there. This is Jon Heder's best film, as he finally separates himself from the nerd stereotype he is so ""good"" at portraying. Finally, we see plenty of potentially wonderful careers rising here, especially that of Amy Poeheler and Jenna Fischer. Blades of Glory: The ""Frat Pack"" delivers somewhat yet again, but in a much more complete package of entertainment. If you liked the Frat Pack movies of before, this is definitely for you."

","If you are expecting to see Anchorman/Talladega Nights/ Dodgeball, well, this really is not quite at that level. The film seemed a little rough, as if it were kind of rushed to the theaters. Outside the two main characters, not one other character is remotely developed or valuable to the story. That being said, if you love Will Ferrell, who cares? Ferrell is funny at everything he does and his Chazz Michael Michaels character is no exception. But the character is a little more SNL skit than motion picture character like Ricky Bobby and Ron Burgundy. Heder is pretty good, but obviously it is Ferrell that is going to bring the fans in. Like most Ferrell movies, the plot is not essential, we want to see Ferrell, preferably with his shirt off, acting crazy. He does both. If I really had to rate this film fairly, I would give it a 6, but hey, I love Ferrell, so how about a 7."

The movie had serious potential to be worth it but Will ruined it. If it was not so obsessed with sex it might have been decent. There was just no reason for that and I am disappointed it got a PG-13. I got so sick of the movie, I had to walk out. It is not worth the money to go see it in a movie theater.

","A beautifully acted and directed film that will be hilarious to anyone who has ever watched an Olympic ice dancing competition. One wonders whether it's far from the truth! Will Ferrell is perfect as the hyper-egotistical superstar Chazz Michael Michaels who, rather predictably for a Ferrell film, has a spectacular fall from grace. He's barred from skating for life, for fighting with rival Jimmy McIlroy (Jon Heder), who is also banned. But McIlroy's nutty stalker, Hector (Nick Swardson) finds a loophole, in that Chazz and Jimmy could try becoming a male- male dancing pair. Almost stealing the show are Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as the Van Waldenberg siblings, the hysterically nasty, incestuous rivals to Chazz and Jimmy. They blackmail their Cinderella-style, sweet younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer) to do all sorts of evil things to Jimmy and Chazz, but Katie instead falls awkwardly in love with Jimmy. Poehler and Arnett are obviously loving their dastardly roles and I don't know how Ferrell and Heder were able to keep straight faces through all of their own ridiculously silly dialogue and routines. All in all, a very good movie."

","For some reason I have always wanted to see this movie. Yesterday I finally got the chance and now I feel quite puzzled why I ever wanted to see this movie so badly in the first place.<br/><br/>It had always been the premise of the movie that wanted me to see it. It was so ridicules and silly that it sounded hilarious to me. But as it turned out the movie did far too little with it and wasn't being all that clever or original with any of its comedy.<br/><br/>It's not like the movie ever becomes truly bad but it just doesn't become hilarious either. It was a true middle of road movie, that was being average in about every way thinkable. Average story, average characters, average jokes and even average acting, despite the presence of many comedy greats.<br/><br/>The movie is being very typical for a silly modern comedy, with childish humor, absurd characters and a ridicules main premise. Everything is deliberately over-the-top, so if you can't stand these type of comedies you can better stay away from this movie. Also when you're not a big Will Ferrell fan it is best to avoid this movie, though I must say Will Ferrell seemed a bit restrained- and like he was holding back in this movie.<br/><br/>Most of the jokes of the movie are homosexual orientated, which doesn't come as a big surprise really. It's what makes the comedy of the movie often too predictable and lame even. It's not like the movie is homophobic though. I mean, the movie is being far too silly and over-the-top for that. If you are offended by this movie, you are taking things far too seriously and I doubt that comedies are your thing.<br/><br/>The movie still really tries but in the end it does feel like a very run of the mill movie, that besides remains underdeveloped. Some of the side-plots of the movie seemed to have some potential in them but the movie drops them before they could develop properly. All signs that the directors Josh Gordon & Will Speck didn't always knew what they were doing, or were playing things too often, too safe. A more confident and experienced director could had turned this movie into something more funny and also more original probably.<br/><br/>The movie never becomes great but it just doesn't ever become all that great either. Therefore see this movie or don't. You won't feel any better or worse afterward.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","To put it blunty: There are few movies on the planet I would consider worse than Blades of Glory. Visualize with me an absolutely inane and tired plot with terrible dialogue tied up with lame actors. You might have something close to Blades of Glory.<br/><br/>The plot plods along predictably, following a very familiar sports movie plot line. An unlikely duo is pitted against snobby rivals who try to cheat but are ultimately foiled by the forces of good. Adding Will Ferrell and Jon Heder and calling it a comedy does little to remedy this train wreck of a setup, or its cardboard romance subplot.<br/><br/>The jokes are flat-out dull, especially for the bizarrely-underused craziness of Will Ferrell. If you think incestuous figure skaters and routine references to Jon Heder's testicles are comedy gold, you may have a job on the staff of (Heaven forbid) Blades of Glory 2.<br/><br/>The ask-a-Ninja once made an advertisement for Blades of Glory, but I have this to say to the interested. There is no glory in Blades of Glory."

","From the beginning of this film (when you see the young boy skating on the lake) I pretty much knew what I was in for. Another formulaic Will Ferrell comedy romp. Don't get me wrong, I think Will's a very funny guy, but the jokes in this movie were weak. I loved ""Tallegeda Nights"" because the humor was low-brow and appealed to guys. (I mean how many women like NASCAR).<br/><br/>The humor in ""Blades of Glory"" was mostly of a sexual nature, but not ""Bathroom"" humor. For instance Jon Heder's character says he was forced to be circumcised to ""Lower wind Resistance"". These types of jokes appeal to chicks.<br/><br/>I just sat thru this movie and basically didn't laugh much and wondered how it did so well at the box office. It seemed to borrow heavily from ""Zoolander"" and ""Dodge Ball"" (2 great movies in my opinion) but didn't really pull it off simply because we've seen it all before. Maybe if you've never seen these 2 movies you'll think Blades of Glory is hilarious."

Jon Heder matches him as the clean American 26-year-old virgin boy (Hollywood's new favorite subject). They form an all-male skating couple! This is a new comedy idea, well supported by Craig T Nelson as their coach. It's funny, down to earth, and its intention is to be an intelligent but silly movie .

Will Ferrell plays a character that would stand perfectly well next to all of his SNL characters, which, I know, is kind of a backhanded complement. But he's funny, God bless him, and the writers (Jeff and Craig Cox, as well as several others) give us plenty to laugh at besides him. John Heder was starting to suggest that he had nothing in him besides Napoleon Dynamite, but he's pretty funny here. Amy Poehler and Will Arnet are great as the villains, and Nick Swardson, a Minneapolitan whose stand-up act I'm going to see in June, has a great role as Heder's stalker (stick around for the end credits to see a hilarious bit with him). There are so many great comedy moments, but the climactic chase sequence between Ferrell and Arnet, which starts out funny enough on ice skates but gets about ten times funnier when they reach dry land, has to be one of the funniest sequences of all time. This is the rare movie that I was sad to see end, because I just enjoyed it so much."

Too silly in the beginning, it picked up after Ferrell and Jon Heder started teaming up with Craig T. Nelson coaching. A subplot involving a rival brother-and-sister team played by real-life married couple Will Arnett and Amy Poehler and little sis Kate played by ""The Office"" star Jenna Fischer contributes to the most hilarious scene in the movie: A call to Kate from Heder's character in which each is coached to say certain double entendre lines that don't match their personalities. Amusing cameos by various skaters Nancy Kerrigan, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, and Sasha Cohen partly makes the movie a little more tolerable than it really is though the funniest scenes come from Ferrell even though he seems to be trying a little harder than usual. Scott Hamilton and Jim Lamply also do well with deadpan lines as the announcers and when I read the credits, two of the stunt performers were Canadian Silver/Gold skaters David Pelletier and Jamie Sale. There's also an amusing scene between Ferrell and Fischer that plays sweet and a little sexual that almost-but not quite-crosses the line.

","This movie has a storyline that you wouldn't think would be one from a Will Ferrell movie. This actor normally plays macho guys with uber masculine personalities and professions, but this film features him as a professional ice skater. He does put a bit of masculinity in his character, which is portrayed in the very first scene with his first performance shown in the movie. This different, yet same, character portrayal by Ferrell was a great change that I enjoyed watching.
I also thought it was very interesting to see Ferrell star with Jon Heder in this film. The two actors have particularly different styles when it comes to comedy; Ferrell's is more inappropriate humor, while Heder has more of a weird and quirky style. This film seems to combine these two styles in a hilarious manner, creating a wider range of humor for the audience. 
The plot of this film was pretty different, but also somewhat basic (they're in a competition, they have rivals, there's a romantic interest). What really makes it hilarious are the unique characters of Jimmy and Chazz, and other characters like the Van Waldenburg siblings, Jimmy's number one fan, and the pair's coach (played by Craig T Nelson). 
This movie is a very quotable one, and is the perfect mix of Jon Heder's quirky and Will Ferrell's classic humor."

It also takes a dig at the campiness of ice skating. Chazz is a macho, a sex addict with a tough style of dancing. You can guess he is based on the 90s Canadian ice skater Elvis Stojko. Jimmy is more fey and artistic.<br/><br/>The films make good use of CGI as we actually believe that the actors are skating.

","Blades of Glory (2007): Dir: Josh Gordon, Will Speck / Cast: Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, Jenna Fischer: Very funny comedy that takes jabs at figure skating and same sex couples. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder play professional figure skaters whom are banned when their differences result in a catastrophe. A loop hole allows them to reenter as a pair. Great setup delivers on background but it skates on predictable circumstances and formula. Directors Will Speck and Josh Gordon are backed with flashy production that mirrors and makes fun of figure skating. To their credit both directors were involved in two projects called Culture and Angry Boy. This marks their biggest marketed film to date. Ferrell plays a sex craving brute who is good at what he does but must put his ego aside if he is to regain glory on the ice again. Heder is abandoned by his adoptive father and struggles with insecurity. Both leads are funny but it isn't difficult to predict the union and the outcome. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler portray a scandalous sibling team who will attempt to sabotage the duo. Jenna Fischer factors in when she is used to sabotage the skating duo with sex but she will soon realize the errors of her ways.

","Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy are banned from figure skating for life after a brawl breaks out between the two of them during the medal ceremony. With the help of Coach (Craig T. Nelson) , Chazz and Jimmy reluctantly decide to make a comeback in pairs. The Van Waldenberg's (Poehler & Arnett) do everything they can to thwart those plans to undermine them with underhanded tactics. I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan. I hated this movie the first time I saw it. I thought it was completely unfunny. I'm not sure if it was the type of mood I was in, but I actually thought it wasn't too shabby this time around. The premise is absolutely juvenile and silly, but there are some genuine laughs here. The laughs are intermittent, but I laughed a lot more than I expected to. This has your ""typical"" comedy cast and I dislike figure skating as a sport in general, but Ferrell and Heder manage to make it work somehow. It does have some lazy humor (Ferrell singing My Humps by the Black Eyed Peas flopped badly) But there are some raunchy gags that legitimately cracked me up. The figure skating action is actually fun to watch. Despite that it's done in comedic fashion, I didn't mind watching it. Will Ferrell gives one of his better performances here. He's still lazy at times, but he actually made me laugh. I'll give credit where it's due. Jon Heder plays a great straight man. His chemistry with Ferrell was solid. Craig T. Nelson takes everything seriously and was a lot of fun to watch. Amy Poehler & Will Arnett make solid foes for Ferrell & Heder. Jenna Fischer did well in her role. As a huge Boy Meets World fan, I had to point this out! William Daniels (Mr. Feeny) makes an appearance as a commissioner!<br/><br/>I'll take what I can get. It's far from great, but I laughed a fair amount, even if it was sporadic. If you enjoy silly humor, you'll certainly get your money's worth here. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>6.4/10"

","That is one of the most funniest movies I know. It is rare in these times that I can watch a film over and over again. It is perfectly written, acted and overall very nicely crafted. It is a perfect parody on that ridiculous seriousness of this sport. The lines are so funny and the story is hilarious. Sometimes it hurts my stomach because of the laughing. Here at IMDb's it is completely underrated. Maybe from Dumb&Dumber fans ? I have no idea why this movie is not at least rated around 8 Stars. Because of this movie I watched more Ferrell stuff like -The Anchorman- but as so often, I hardly can smile at most of the Hollywood comedy's. This one is something else and makes me laugh every time I watch it ! I give it a ten out of ten. It's flawless."

Ferrell always knows what to say in his roles for them to be really funny (although he more recently played a serious role in ""Everything Must Go"").<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a funny one.

As with White Chicks, I have to wonder why anyone would bother making a flick where the intended audience are already making all of those same jokes, and, indeed, they needn't be made, because, for all those of us who are not into the subject being mocked(there, fashion and the Hilton sisters, and here, professional ice skating), I'm sorry to say, it already looks silly. This was directed by the duo who do the cave-man commercials, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that it's overdone and seldom funny. The script leaves no doubt as to the fact that those who wrote it still giggle when they say naughty words. You know why Trey Parker and Matt Stone get away with that? Because they have a lot of truth in their material, and their satire is biting. This just tries to get laughs from the audience by having men behave effeminately. The characters are purely based around gags they could do, and this has next to no substance. I can't claim that this engaged me for a second. The acting is fine. Every recognizable face in this but Ferrell and Heder embarrass themselves. The plot is formulaic and utterly predictable. There is crude, and occasionally downright disgusting, stuff in this, and the language is moderately strong. The DVD contains featurettes that I will review on their individual pages, a music video, deleted scenes, a gag reel and alternate takes. I recommend this solely to big fans of the two stars.

","I'm a big Will Ferrell fan. Anchorman is pure genius. Old School is great. Even Talladega Nights and Semi-Pro, while not brilliant, were well worth watching and had plenty of laughs. Somehow, Ferrell missed the mark with Blades of Glory.<br/><br/>Ferrell is the only one who manages to deliver any laughs in this movie and they are few and far between. Unless you have the mind of a 12-year-old, you'll quickly get over the homo-erotic humor of two guys figure skating together, and start looking for something more clever. Sadly, there isn't anything more clever going on here.<br/><br/>The constant bickering between Ferrell and Heder gets old fast. Heder was great in Napoleon Dynamite, but he doesn't have much to offer here. Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, both usually eccentric and hysterical, are given weak supporting roles as the ""evil"" reigning pairs champions. They're always trying to destroy their competition in any way possible, much like the bad guys in a stereotypical Disney movie.<br/><br/>A lot of Ferrell's incredible weirdness (which makes him great) fails to come through in this movie. Instead we're left with predictable, overused physical comedy and a tired sports-movie plot about overcoming adversity. I'm a little baffled by the 6.6 rating here on IMDb, as this is clearly Ferrell's weakest film."

This hilarious premise provides the backdrop for one of the funniest comedies I've seen in quite a while, full of outrageous physical comedy, silly homo erotic moments, and some silly sight gags made all the sillier by some intentionally cheesy looking special effects. Ferrell has rarely been funnier and has a surprisingly solid screen chemistry with Heder, who makes the most of the best role he's had in quite awhile. There are also funny supporting turns from Will Arnett and Amy Poehler as a brother and sisters pairs team who are threatened by the new team, Craig T.Nelson as Chaz and Jimmy's coach and Romany Malco (THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN) as their choreographer. A riot from start to finish. Don't miss this one."

","The Will Ferrell & Jon Heder 'odd couple' buddy comedy ""Blades of Glory"" pokes a lot of good-natured humor at straight-up masculinity with its hilarious pairing of two guys as figure skaters in a competitive sport traditionally dominated by male & female teams rather than a same sex twosome. Imagine the D.B. Sweeney & Moira Kelly romantic comedy ""The Cutting Edge"" (1992) with two dudes ice-skating in tandem instead of the usual male & female duo, and you've got an adequate idea about what to expect from co-directors Will Speck and Josh Gordon in their big-screen debut.<br/><br/>Speck and Gordon called the shots on two short comedy films, ""Angry Boy"" (1996) and ""Culture"" (1998), but they are best known for a number of Geico commercials that they have helmed along with the Super Bowl spot TV commercial 'Exaggerating Dad' for Emerald Nuts. Were it not for the brilliance of Ferrell and Heder in the lead roles, this soporific satire about figure-skating would amount to little more than a live-action spin on the venerable 1960s' cartoon series ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" with real-life married couple Will Arnett & Amy Poehler cast as a villainous combo along the lines of Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Although brothers Jeff and Craig Cox penned their screenplay based on an idea by Elizabeth Jean 'Busy' Philipps, ""Blades of Glory"" virtually replicates the plots of two earlier Ferrell hit comedies ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004) and ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (2006).<br/><br/>As super macho athlete Chazz Michael Michaels, Will Ferrell qualifies as the wild man of the skating rink. An alcoholic with a sex addiction dilemma, Chazz resembles a tall, flabby Jim Morrison, when he isn't espousing the politically incorrect mind-set of a drunken Neanderthal, picture the late comic genius John Belushi from either ""Animal House"" or ""1941."" When we first see him on the ice, Chazz sports a black Waylon Jennings' Stetson, dresses like a biker, and skates to hard-rocking strains of Billy Squire's 1980s' classic hit ""The Stroke."" Women swoon as Chazz skates past them, and they shower him with thongs and double-D bras. No sooner has the pelvic-thrusting Chazz strutted his he-man stuff than rival figure-skating champ Jimmy MacElroy (John Heder of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""The Benchwarmers"") glides onto the ice to the melodic tunes of Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. Slender, elegant, tasteful, with a hallo of blow-dried blond hair, Jimmy impersonates a graceful peacock, decked out in a powder-blue, spandex outfit, with a fluff of tail feathers sprouting from his rump. These guys cannot stand the sight of each other either on the ice or off the rink. Indeed, they hate each other with a passion. The recipients of a shared gold medal for men's singles at the Olympic World Wintersport Games, Chazz and Jimmy struggle to tolerate each other during the awards ceremony. Chazz's blend of raunchy cologne with his taco-meat smelling body odor prompts Jimmy to assault him. The two scuffle before an audience of millions while the judges gape in horror.<br/><br/>During their fisticuffs, they tip over a flaming candleholder that ignites the costume of a guy inside of a mascot suit. Commissioner Ebbers (the always funny William Daniels, who provided the voice of the car in the 1980s' TV show ""Knight Rider"") and a panel of real-life skaters, including Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Brian Boitano, and Nancy Kerrigan, summarily ban Chazz and Jimmy for life from figure-skating.<br/><br/>Not only does Jimmy lose his wealthy Donald Trump-style sponsor Darren MacElroy (William Fichtner of ""Armageddon"") who had discovered him in a Catholic orphanage and nurtured his figure-skating talent, but also his coach (Craig T. Nelson of ""All The Right Moves"") loses his job. Simultaneously, Chazz winds up skating in a children's ice show as a wizard, but he gets fired for boozing it up and puking inside of his costume. The only person who displays loyalty to a disgraced and fallen Jimmy is his male stalker Hector (Nick Swardson, better known as the male hooker Terry on ""Reno 911""), who is under a restraining order to stay away from Jimmy. Hector, however, uncovers a loophole in the bylaws that allows Jimmy to resume his figure-skating career, but only as a participant in a doubles team. Yeah, you guessed it, Jimmy and Chazz team up at the behest of the coach who wants to give them another shot at stardom.<br/><br/>Despite some uneven pacing in the early parts of this over-the-top comedy, ""Blades of Glory"" serves up a plethora of sight gags and off-color jokes that won't be soon forgotten. Ferrell and Heder make an interesting pair in this definitely off-beat coupling."

Over all, Blades of Glory is a fun movie with some fun laughs and gags. Will and Jon actually clicked very well and were a perfect combo, it seemed like they really enjoyed working together. Also, I think the thing that worked for me is that they broke out of their typical characters that they play, they were no longer the leading role, but actually worked as partners. The story was definitely entertaining and reminded me of Zoolander, only with... synchronized skaters.<br/><br/>Chazz Michael Michaels is a former porn star turned ice skater and is also a sex addict, but he's doing very well in the Olympics along with his component Jimmy MacElroy, an orphan adopted by a rich millionaire who is also a champion skater. They both are fighting like crazy and end up loosing their medals due to their constant battles. But when they want to return so badly to the ice, they are allowed only if they have a partner, and they get one, only this time, they're the partners to turn in the most exciting performances. But the duo they're competing against, the Waldenburg siblings are going to make sure that they fail and fall flat on the ice.<br/><br/>Blades of Glory is a fun comedy that I have to admit was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. The scene that definitely got me is the chase sequence between Chazz and Stranz, when they have their skates on and they're on the marble floors was just priceless. I think I would recommend this, definitely if you enjoy comedies like Zoolander, this is right up your alley.

","Blades of Glory is an underrated, hilarious comedy about to arch enemies having to work together to win their lives and glory back. A pretty common premise, but seriously folks, it has never worked better in the history of cinema. Will Ferrell totally redeems himself for all the crap he's been doing since Saturday Night Live. The role as an anarchistic, sex-addicted cowboy-skater couldn't be performed better by anyone. Jon Heder is not quite as funny as his innocent sidekick, but no one could be, and he's doing a good job. Especially their skating scenes together is historically funny. Blades of Glory just never stops being funny, and every time You start to think it's getting a bit old, it flips around and takes a new direction.

","If you have ever watched a men's figure-skating routine and wondered how someone could not feel challenged in their masculinity standing in front of thousands of people wearing what amounts to frilly leotards, then ""Blades Of Glory"" was made for you.<br/><br/>It's the story of Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder) and Chazz Michael Michaels (Will Ferrell), rival figure skaters who get each other thrown out of men's singles competition. But nothing prevents them from returning as pairs skaters, skating with each other, in fact, as encouraged by Jimmy's former coach (Craig T. Nelson).<br/><br/>Before you can say ""Brokeback Rink"", it should be said that the homosexual context, with one glorious exception when Jimmy and Chazz perform their first routine, is somewhat minimized in favor of character-based comedy. Jimmy is a hopeless goodie-goodie, while Chazz is described by sports anchor Jim Lampley as ""an ice-devouring sex tornado"" claiming carnal knowledge with both Michelle Kwan and Oksana Baiul and filling his programs with crotch grabs and thinly-disguised references to his untamed libido.<br/><br/>""That was disgusting,"" Jimmy tells Chazz after watching one such performance.<br/><br/>""That, young man, is how babies are made,"" Chazz purrs.<br/><br/>As Will Ferrell comedies go, ""Blades Of Glory"" isn't the borderline classic ""Anchorman"" was, but it is smart, stylish, and funny all the way through, something that can not be said of many of his other, more highly touted flicks (""Old School"", ""Talladega Nights""). Chazz may be a slight variation on the Neil Diamond character Ferrell played on ""Saturday Night Live"", but as Ferrell develops him in what appear to be largely improvised scenes, Chazz emerges as a character of enough depth so as to sustain your interest over 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Also helping is Heder carrying more than his share of the picture. ""Blades Of Glory"" is really as much about Jimmy than about Chazz, and Heder gives his straight-man part enough unique idiocy to sustain and even enhance our enjoyment of ""Blades Of Glory"" when Chazz is not around.<br/><br/>Add to that Lampley and Scott Hamilton's game impersonations of themselves as skating commentators (Lampley: ""Chazz Michael Michael has dominated this audience like a stack of classic Euro-porn""); the goofy nemesis of rival pairs skaters Fairchild and Stranz Van Waldenberg (Amy Poehler and Will Arnett), who take to the ice dressed as Vanilla Ice rappers, Marilyn Monroe, and JFK; and over-the-top costumes and CGI effects, and you get a film that amuses on multiple levels all the way through.<br/><br/>It's not sharp comedy, Will Ferrell plays too much for the cheap seats for that to ever be true, and there are only two gut-buster sequences to speak of (one being Chazz and Jimmy's first pairs performance, the other involving a drunken Chazz at a children's ice show). But you walk away from ""Blades Of Glory"" with no thought other than wanting the DVD, thus making it a perfect escape on ice."

","This movie is one of those Hollywood Cinderella stories that we hear of from time to time. Unknown Directors, Gordon and Speck, teamed up with a pair unknown brothers (Jeff and Craig Cox) to somehow land a project with star Will Ferrell and Napoleon Dynamite's star, Jon Heder. The result is a silly comedy, that is just as dumb as it appears to be, but is entertaining, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Chazz Michael Michaels (Ferrell) and Jimmy MacElroy (Heder) are bitter figure skating rivals who are stripped of their gold medals and left banned from men's figure skating. Soon, they find a loophole that will allow them to compete in the pair's arena, much to the consternation of the ruling champions, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Arnett and Poehler), who set out to disrupt their progress. Their coach (Craig T. Nelson) has a secret move, though. It's dangerous, but can min it all for themÂ…if they can just master it in two weeks! This movie has some funny moments with overblown skating scenes, though the gag about homophobic guys who are freaked out by physical contact with another man is played to death. Look for some cameos by a number of skating stars. This will be enjoyed by Ferell fans and others who don't mind comedies that don't recognize any limits on how silly a movie can get.<br/><br/>This work was first posted on realmoviereview.com"

","The preview was just horrible. The movie was funny. Well directed, and acted. I like stupid humor and 'Blades of Glory' has lots of it. Such as the fight at the Olympic podium part. The toilet paper scene, and the sex addict meeting. 7 out of 10. Will does a good job, and is not over the top. Jon Herd is a talented actor we will see more of him in the future. Turn your brain off for this movie. A good rental. A weird concept. Can 2 guys skate in doubles? My bet is no! The skating scenes were great laughs. Tawnya harden part was added in. Nancy gets a bit part. I think Will is picking better movies to play in. He doing more lead roles, which he handles better with time."
"Antagonisten","6","0","2","3 September 2007"," Do you like Will Ferrell?
","It seems to me that Will Ferrell is working like a factory these days. Movies like this one seem to come out every six months or so. Or maybe that's just how it feels, but after seeing movies like ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"" and others in rather short succession it feels like Ferrell is everywhere. And why not i guess, he does have genuine comedy talent in my opinion.<br/><br/>This movie is about the rivalry of two male figure skaters. One of them, Will Ferrell, is the bad boy of skating. The other, Jon Heder, is a saint-like mamas-boy. After a competition they start to fight, after that they are both banned from male skating forever. Although new ideas soon get them both back on the ice, this time as a team.<br/><br/>The whole figure-skating thing just begs to be turned into a comedy. It's a silly sport (figure-skaters will have to excuse me) and on top of that of course very feminine even for the male skaters. I guess part of the reason why figure skating is considered so feminine is the fact that if you skate you either figure-skate or play hockey... And those things are at very opposite ends of the scale. Anyway, the idea of Ferrell as slating's bad-boy works pretty well. There are quite a few memorable scenes in this movie, most of them happening on or around the ice. It also has quite a few moments of silly comedy that doesn't really go anywhere. But in general the whole set-up works pretty well.<br/><br/>I guess the main thing here is whether you like Will Ferrell or not. If you don't like him, this is bound to become tiresome rather quickly. I think Ferrell is one of the most talented people doing these kinds of movies, so personally i didn't mind. I did like Talladega Nights better though. Still, if you like this brand of comedy (the brand of other Will Ferrell-movies and movies like Dodgeball, 40-year Old Virgin etc.) this will probably keep you entertained. I rate it 6/10."

","This film is about the unlikely partnership of two ice skating rivals in the world championship of double figure skating.<br/><br/>The idea of fusing modern moves, such as hip hop, robot dance and even resuscitation into ice skating is really good. It works well because these are new ideas, and they provide visually dynamic scenes. The costumes are also interesting, and the most memorable one is of course the skate rockets. The initial rivalry between Chazz and Jimmy is built well, and the subsequent partnership is also strong. The jokes are good, and the ice skating moves have to be seen to be believed.

","This movie is another one of a long line of Will Farrell movies that are so bad, they're good. As usual, this isn't an intelligent comedy in any respect, but I'll be damned if I didn't bust my gut laughing at least 10 times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The film is a healthy mix of inane dialogue and visual humour, with both Farrell and Heder giving compelling performances. Farrell is especially gifted with random off the wall comments his arguments with Heder are comedy gold. Even funnier than the dialogue though, are the numerous skating routines in sequined spandex, replete with uber-homoerotic moves which are guaranteed to make you cringe and laugh your a** off at the same time.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the baddies were quite lame (as baddies go) and their sister doesn't really do much to gain the audience's affection either. I suppose the movie wanted to retain the focus on the two protagonists, which is probably a good idea in this type of flick.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid comedy and well worth a watch or two on DVD."

","Next to Anchorman this is by far the funniest of Wil Ferrels comedies. It is constantly quotable, holds its humor from start to finish which is thanks to the screenwriters. The director's won't allow Heder to let Napoleon go but it works for the most part none the less. The characterization of MacElroy and Michaels creates true rounded humorous characters. The ice skating sequences are a crack up and even at times tense. Josh Gordon and Wil Speck keep Ferrell under control which the director couldn't do in his previous dismal effort of Talladega Nights. It's a fun way to spend an hour and a half, and all though you can explain the plot in thirty seconds this film doesn't ask for much more. What you see if what you get, and what you get is a really good belly laugh."

","Will Ferrell can do almost anything and here is play a sex addicted (heterosexual) American men's single figure skater, Chaz Michael Michales. His main competition is played by John Heder from Napoleon Dynamite as James McElroy who is adopted by a rich billionaire who takes talented orphans and makes them superstars. He's played by the great character actor, William Fichtner ( I remember him from As the World Turns). Heder can actually hold his own playing this gifted, sexually naive, effeminate skater. Both skaters get booted from men's single competition after a fight. So after three and half years of doing ice shows and working at a sports store, McElroy's longtime coach played by Craig T. Nelson reunites them to do pairs skating. Unfortunately, the top American pairs skating is played by the funny Amy Poehler from Saturday Night Live and her real-life husband Will Arnett as Fairchild and Stranz Von Wallenburg. They are like Kitty and Peter Carruthers of their time, another brother-sister team from the United States. The Office's Jenna Fischer plays Kate Von Wallenburg, the younger sister and assistant to her siblings' obsessive quest for the gold. In the meantime, Kate and Jimmy fall for each other but Kate's sister Fairchild has other plans for her sister. The Von Wallenberg siblings are always blaming Kate for their parents death in a car accident as they were driving her to ice skating practice. Of course, there are cameos by Olympic Gold Medalists, Peggy Fleming, Scott Hamilton who plays a commentator and Britan Boitano, and Olympic Silver & Bronze medalist Nancy Kerrigan at the National Skaters ASsociation. Of course, the writers have worked around not setting it around the United States Figure Skating Association and their Olympics is the Wintersports in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It's a funny movie despite some flaws. If only ice skating was about art instead of about how many triple jumps that a person can do in four minutes. Most of the music, costumes, and actions in the figure skating world shown here wouldn't pass the world skating league."

","this movie is hilarious. the kind of fun that you'd get from situations that would make you feel embarrassed and uncomfortable, but all turned to a good joke and lots of humor. somebody compared Will Ferrell's character to his role of Ron Burgundy in Anchorman, and it might be true, because here again he is the self proclaimed macho and super hero of skating, but here we also see another side of this character - one that turns from prima donna to team-player, from narcissist to a friend and 'brother' - and the transformation of course is laughable.<br/><br/>Cant tell much about other actors' performances except that they do good job supporting the main characters. Jon Heder makes a good role depicting the feminine part of the duo opposing the masculine Ferrell. it is truly laughable<br/><br/>i thought that the movie goes too fast, but well, i guess that is because the authors wouldn't want any of us to take it that seriously.<br/><br/>i give it 9/10 because of the nice jokes, the fun characters and hilarious situations. have fun<br/><br/>peace"
"dfle3","8","0","3","24 July 2007"," Absurdly funny movie
","This is the funniest movie I've seen at the cinema this year-it's funny in an absurd way. The premise of the movie is simple yet absurd...two brilliant male ice-skaters tie for a competition gold medal and end up fighting as a result. They are both banned from the sport for life. Due to a loop-hole they can skate competitively again...in pairs skating. You can guess what transpires here.<br/><br/>The feuding skaters feud, no doubt, due to their completely different personalities. Chaz, played by Will Ferrell, is a macho, testosterone fuelled sex-addict with a butch skating style. Jimmy, played by ""Napolean Dynamite's"" lead, Jon Heder, is an effeminate and graceful skater. Much of the humour involves them having stupid school-boy like exchanges.<br/><br/>Another big factor in the comedy is how 'unseemly' it is for two male skaters to skate as a pair. Chaz can't seem to hide his disgust at some of the positions he and Jimmy have to get into for their art.<br/><br/>One thing that I got great enjoyment from was the choice of music-some beautiful music (""Time to say goodbye"") to introduce Jimmy, and the macho rock of ""Stroke me"" for Chaz. And Queen's classic ""Flash"" gets used to great effect too.<br/><br/>Early on, there is some commentary of the two guys skating which would be very familiar in style and substance to that provided here in Australia by Roy and H.G. in their brilliant Sydney Olympics 'parallel' commentary for their short series ""The Dream"" (should be on DVD, I think). Blades Of Glory is like what a sport would look like IF what Roy and H.G. described was actually accurate. For Roy and H.G. fans, you will see in the movie plenty of ""battered sav"" and ""I'm a princess"" skating moves.<br/><br/>The film does feature some adult content, so is probably a bit too risqué for pre-teens. One of the highlights of the movie is a 'legendary' skating move called ""The iron lotus"". It is a truly stunning set piece & good for some Holy Grail type laughs.<br/><br/>A competing pair also provides some laughs from left field-their last skating routine in the movie is right out of the Roy and H.G. handbook of interpretive dance!"

","Lessons I Learned from Blades of Glory: Heder will never win an Oscar, and the night is a dark time for everyone--but not for Alaskans and dudes with night vision goggles. The movie is brought to a higher level of stupid thanks to Ferrell's hilarious performance. Props to him for making his Chazz Michaels--who literally pairs up with Heder's Jimmy MacElroy to win the Olympics after they're banned from singles ice skating--multidimensional in such a comedy. I wish I could say the same for Heder; during the entire movie I was wondering why Napoleon Dynamite was ice skating instead of feeding Tina. Anyway, I wasn't even bugged by the film's ending (similar to a ridiculous one belonging to a 1978 film), because by the end of its two hours my I.Q. had dropped about forty points and life was simply a box of chocolates and shrimp gumbo. Thanks to Ferrell's acting and some so-dumb-they're-funny jokes I realized that films like these feed America's stupidity...and I was okay with it. ***"
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","8","0","2","11 July 2007"," Will Ferrell's Funniest Film!
","Blades of Glory is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I loved it so much. I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell anyway and I've always found him to be a comic god, but this film was just icing on the cake. Come on, Will Ferrell as a professional ice skater? It just had to be funny! The plot is pretty simple. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder (Napoloeon Dynamite) play rival ice skaters Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy McElroy who get into a fight and are banned from the championships. But then one day one of Jimmy's obsessed fans named Hector finds a loophole in the championships. Chazz and Jimmy can compete in the finals if they have a partner. So then Chazz and Jimmy decide to become partners, despite their hatred for each other. Then they must compete against brother and sister Stranz and Fairchild Von Strausenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler) who are among the greatest skaters in the history of ice-skating.<br/><br/>Some of the funniest scenes in this film included Chazz and Jimmy training to become partners and preparing for their stunts. Most of the jokes involve them being two men wearing tight leotards and touching each other's manhood during their performances, but they worked and they were funny! I don't recall any joke in this film falling flat. Will Ferrell was his usual loud, over-acting self doing disgusting things and being in his underwear, but it had me in tears it was so funny. I enjoyed this one more than I did last year's Talladega Nights. Jon Heder played a role a little different than Napoleon Dynamite and I was impressed. He was sweet and funny and cute and innocent as Jimmy. I didn't quite understand why his character was made out to be so feminine, but I still liked his character. One of the funniest scenes in this film is when Chazz (Will Ferrell) took off his shoes and socks and walked across the ice barefoot to show how much of a man he is. And then Jimmy stripped down to his underwear and slid across the ice on his bare chest to outdo Chazz!! My sister and I were howling at that scene. I loved all the skating sequences. Ice skating is a beautiful sport to watch. I love the hand movements and all the twists and turns the skaters do. Very elegant.<br/><br/>Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were equally as great as the brother and sister team who intended on winning and outdoing Chazz and Jimmy. Their relationship was a little creepy, as in some scenes they got a little too close to each other and in one scene they actually kissed on the lips!! But I thought it was so funny because Will Arnett and Amy Poehler are actually husband and wife. I found that interesting. I loved the scene where Will Arnett was chasing Will Ferrell through the building and they both had their skates on!! Craig T. Nelson was also great in a supporting role as Chazz and Jimmy's trainer/mentor. I didn't understand why the makeup people made him look so old but he was still great. He had some great one-liners as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, Blades of Glory isn't a great film by any means, but it is definitely fun to watch and anyone who is a fan of Will Ferrell or Jon Heder should enjoy this one. There are a lot of sex jokes in this film and it's not for the little kids, but it is still pretty funny. It will definitely keep a smile on your face. I love Will Ferrell! He is one of the greatest comedians of our time. I enjoyed this film so much and I will own the DVD!! I'm so glad I got the chance to see it at the $1 movie on Wednesdays! Thanks for reading my review!"

Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite, The Benchwarmers) plays Chazz's nemesis, skating prodigy Jimmy MacElroy. In a competition, the two had to share the men's single's gold medal, and so a fight ensues between the archrivals, which leads to their being banned from men's competitive figure skatingin the single's division, that is! Jimmy's crazed fan discovers a loophole in the rules, which enables the two to team up to compete in partner skating, much to the displeasure of skating sibling sensations Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (played by real-life husband and wife SNL stars Will Arnett and Amy Poehler). They coerce their sister Katie (played by The Office's Jenna Fischer) into spying for them, but she ends up falling for the competition.<br/><br/>As always, Ferrell irreverently ad-libs his way throughout the movie; hence, the need for the remarkably alert cast to react and play able foil to his spontaneous bursts of hilarity.

Ferrel's movies are centered around sexual humor usually, and Heder in my opinion doesn't fit in with the whole sexual humor thing. But the duo still give the crowd plenty of laughs. And of course Will Ferrel himself is a riot. Overall the movie is worth a trip if you've got time on your hands, but if you're a fan of Anchorman like I am, don't expect to this one to pass it.

Unlike his mad rival Jimmy Makinro (perfect Jon Heder), Chazz is a loner. And a sex maniac. and of course, tons of beautiful women would do anything to sleep with him. Unlike him, Jimmy was under tough love - control all his life, by his stepfather (William Fitchner, again with Ferrel).
