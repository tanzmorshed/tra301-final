","A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.<br/><br/>He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?<br/><br/>Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.<br/><br/>As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.  But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.  We know Travis will snap again.  But the story doesn't end with Travis either.  It continues today in the cities and in the schools.  The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.<br/><br/>This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  It didn't cause those things.  It predicted them."
"francheval","10","277","325","13 February 2006"," Diary of a madman
","The script of ""Taxi Driver"" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't, while violence accumulates inside him. One of those unnoticed people with dark things on their mind, one of those who break up the news one day with some extraordinary outburst of rage, to fall back immediately into anonymity.<br/><br/>The gradual transformation of man into beast in this movie is chilling. It's still funny and pathetic when the hero threatens himself in front of the mirror (""you're talking to me?""), but when he comes out with a mohawk hairdo and dark glasses, it is obvious that nasty stuff is going to take place. As in ""A Clockwork Orange"", violence is recuperated by society depending on what purpose it is used for. Whereas he was about to murder the candidate for presidency, ""god's lonely man"" fails and instead kills a vicious pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. The potential criminal becomes a hero for a day.<br/><br/>Such stories happen everywhere of course, but it seems that the bewildering atmosphere of New York City's summer night was the best choice. ""Taxi Driver"" gives us a very realistic approach of New York, in a way that is not seen on screen so often, at least not anymore, whilst that city is probably the one in the world that has been filmed the biggest number of times.<br/><br/>Most of the movie takes place at night. The credits open on the blazing lights of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly in the dark rainy streets. A kaleidoscope of neonlight appears through the dripping windows as the driver's eyes blink in the front mirror. The night is the hero's universe, it's the time when ""all the animals come out"", as he says. By contrast, the few daylight scenes look somewhat off-key, but this was definitely intentional.<br/><br/>The final scene still appears today as extremely violent, but at least, it shows murder for what it is. Brutal, ugly, crude. It is something one tends to forget about after seeing so many police series where people get shot so often that it gets casual. Real violence is not casual when you face it, and here is a film that makes you face it.<br/><br/>The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.<br/><br/>Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","121","141","20 November 2003"," Ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Robert De Niro!
","Taxi Driver, the classic that made Robert DeNiro Robert DeNiro. It's amazing to see how far this man has come in cinema, some of my friends ask me questions about films and advice, one of my friends had asked if they wanted to see where Bobby got the big notice I usually recommend Taxi Driver, granted he was in The Godfather Part 2 and was incredible, but Taxi Driver made him stand out as a strong lead actor. Taxi Driver is just all together a great film that is absolutely perfection. Martin Scorcesse who also was just really starting out made this movie that brought us back to the film noir genre. He made this great classic and I don't even think he realized how much it would stand against the test of time, to this day we still know this film and even if you don't know it, you know the infamous speech ""You talking' to me?"". This is a film about isolation, loneliness, and self destruction at it's worst.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle who claims to be an honorably discharged Marine it is implied that he is a Vietnam veteran is a lonely and depressed young man of 26. He settles in Manhattan, where he becomes a night time taxi driver due to chronic insomnia. Bickle spends his restless days in seedy porn theaters and works 12 or 14 hour shifts during the evening and night time hours carrying passengers among all five boroughs of New York City. Bickle becomes interested in Betsy, a campaign volunteer for New York Senator Charles Palantine. She is initially intrigued by Bickle and agrees to a date with him after he flirts with her over coffee and sympathizes with her own apparent loneliness. On their date, however, Bickle is clueless about how to treat a woman and thinks it would be a good idea to take her to a sex film. Offended, she leaves him and takes a taxi home alone. The next day he tries to reconcile with Betsy, phoning her and sending her flowers, but all of his attempts are in vain. Rejected and depressed, Bickle's thoughts begin to turn violent. Disgusted by the petty street crime that he witnesses while driving through the city, he now finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training. He buys a number of pistols from an illegal dealer and practices a menacing speech in the mirror, while pulling out a pistol that he attached to a home-made sliding action holster on his right arm ""You talking' to me?"". Bickle is revolted by what he considers the moral decay around him. One night while on shift, Iris, a 12-year-old child prostitute, gets in his cab, attempting to escape her pimp. Shocked by the occurrence, Bickle fails to drive off and the pimp, Sport, reaches the cab. Later seeing Iris on the street he pays for her time, although he does not have sex with her and instead tries to convince her to leave this way of life behind. But after her rejection as well, Travis decides to take things into his own hands, ""Pow!"".<br/><br/>This is one of the most memorable movies of all time and has really stood it's ground. It's personally one of my favorites and made me fall in love with Robert DeNiro all over again. The script to Taxi Driver is just so incredibly powerful and the performances were just perfect. Jodie Foster, this little girl at the time was such a presence on screen, she pulls in what was a very tricky performance and was hauntingly beautiful. Cybill Sheppard was also very beautiful and I was absolutely in love with her character and felt so bad for her. Everything about Taxi Driver is just great, I don't know how much I could go on about the love I have for this film. It's a film that you will never forget and trust me, if you haven't seen it, go out and rent it immediately, you won't regret it. It's bloody, it's twisted, it's crazy, but it's one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"bob the moo","Null","145","175","13 February 2006"," A wonderfully engaging and convincing slide into a modern madness from a director and actor showing some of their best form
","Travis Bickle is a Vietnam veteran who cannot sleep at night and just ends up travelling around. To try and use the time effectively he becomes a taxi driver. Things start to look up for him as he works nights and slowly starts to live a little bit. He meets a girl, Betsy, and arranges to see her a few times despite the fact that he is a little bit out of the ordinary  a quality that seems to interest her. His connection to the night allows him to see young prostitute Iris being bullied by her pimp Matthew and he begins to see his role to perhaps save her  him playing his part in cleaning up the sewer that he feels New York has become. However when his view of normal life puts Betsy off him he starts to retreat more and more into the night, looking for meaning in his life and growing more and more outraged by the world he is part of.<br/><br/>Hardly the most uplifting of films it is engaging and impressive and truly deserves the reputation it has. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader have produced a film that convincingly portrays a man cut out of society who has the slightest connection to normality before finding it eroded away. The script is brilliant because the detail is engaging but it is this descent into a very modern type of madness that drives the film forward. Travis has just enough about him that is recognisable that it makes it so easy to go along with the rest of his madness. A major part of this is getting the feeling right about living in a cesspit; a city that seems to have forgotten its way morally  New York is the strongest example but elements of it could be parts of any city I suspect. In painting this world in such a real way, Scorsese has made Travis all the more convincing and, to a point, all the easier to follow in his fall. Like I said it is not a film to morally uplift you but one that is depressingly fair. There is no redemption in this modern world and although it appears that the violence at the end somehow redeems Travis in reality by showing ""society"" accepting his action it drags the rest of us down nearer the world that he hates and has become part of. I love King of Comedy for the same reason albeit in a different world.<br/><br/>Scorsese injects a real understanding of the place and a real sense of foreboding into even the earliest scenes. He inserts clever and meaningful shots into scenes that other directors might just have filmed straight and his choice of scene and shot compliments the script is depicting Travis descending into madness. What makes the film even better is De Niro showing the type of form that makes his recent form such a major disappointment. He is outstanding as he moves Travis from being relatively normal to being eaten up from the inside out. His eventual implosion is impressive but it is only as impressive as the gradual slide he depicts over the course of the film. Although he dominates it, others impress as well. Foster stands out in a small role, while Keitel makes a good impression as the pimp. Shepherd is not quite as good but her character was not as well written as the others so it isn't all down to her. Regardless, the film belongs to De Niro and although the quotable scenes are the ones that are remembered it is in the quieter moments where he excels and shows genuine talent and understanding.<br/><br/>Overall an impressive and morally depressing film that deserves its place in cinematic history. The portrayal of a city and a man slipping into moral insanity is convincing and engaging and it shows how well to ""do"" modern madness and the effects of the moral void of parts of society. Scorsese directs as a master despite this being at an early stage in his career and De Niro is chillingly effective as he simply dominates the film in quiet moments and quotable moments alike. I rarely use phrases like ""modern classic"" because I think they are lazy but this is one film that certainly deserves such a label."
"david_vigues","Null","344","436","16 May 2004"," A story about a lonely man
","Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.<br/><br/>This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.<br/><br/>In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking' to me? You talking' to me?' which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece."

","The impact that ""Taxi Driver"" had in its day hasn't diminished, on the contrary, it has acquired a relevance of Shakesperean proportions. Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does."
"JosefSerf","Null","248","321","4 May 2004"," An Enigmatic Masterpiece
","If a picture is worth a thousand words then this movie (moving picture) is worth a million words, which is why it has probably generated at least a million words.<br/><br/>What can one say. The obvious: that ""Taxi Driver"" is great, it is. That it is a masterpiece, it is. What sets this film apart from so many other films, including great films, is that it is an enigma. Every time I watch this film I see something else, I notice something else, I feel something else, I wonder something else. And I am, clearly, not the only one who reacts to the film this way that is why it lends itself to endless speculation and discussion.<br/><br/>Since so many positive reviews have been made, rather than add my own red hot glowing review I thought I would address those people who have written that they don't like ""Taxi Driver"" because, they say, they find it dull and boring, hard to follow, etc. These people miss some important points about the film.<br/><br/>ONE, ""Taxi Driver"" is NOT an action film. If you want an action film watch ""Die Hard"" and its numerous sequels, or ""Lethal Weapon"" and its sequels, not to mention ""Rambo"" and thousands of other ""action flicks.""  Nothing wrong with them, per se. Nothing wrong with liking them either. But is wrong to put down ""Taxi Driver"" because of what it is not.<br/><br/>TWO, ""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what ""Taxi Driver"" shows - Bickle's pathetic life.<br/><br/>THREE, some people say that they don't understand the plot, Bickle's attitudes and behaviour, etc. But that is because ""Taxi Driver"" is about a man who is profoundly emotionally disturbed although he (and his buddies) don't seem to know it. His actions aren't rational because he isn't rational. His actions make no sense because he makes no sense. Offhand, I can't think of any other film that has depicted mental illness as well as ""Taxi Driver"" and no film that attempts to show the world as seen by someone like Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>There you go: three reasons to address the most common criticisms of the film with one notable exception, its controversial ending, but THAT is a whole topic in itself which is just more proof of why ""Taxi Driver"" is so worthwhile - when viewers aren't sure what actually happens in the end (Is Travis hallucinating as he is dying? Is that what the slow moving overhead tracking shot suggests? Or does he really become a hero in the media and get realeased back into the world with his buddies? Etc, etc.) The questions and issues raised by ""Taxi Driver"" just go one and on.<br/><br/>Now if after reading the above you still don't think ""Taxi Driver"" is a great film, I can't help you. I am NOT saying you have to like (or love) ""Taxi Driver"" just appreciate it or at least acknowledge its greatness even if it isn't your cup of tea. Actually, I don't love ""Taxi Driver"" because it doesn't lend itself to love. It is too disturbing a picture precisely because it is way too close to reality, it cuts too close to the bone for my comfort (or rather, discomfort). It is not comfortable to watch because it isn't supposed to be. So if ""Taxi Driver"" makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy it should because real life is uncomfortable and uneasy (unless you are born rich or something).<br/><br/>Finally, after watching it again for the nth time I have begun to notice (and feel) just how smooth ""Taxi Driver"" is. The overall feel and flow of the film is incredibly smooth in which not only each scene but each and every movement and gesture flows into the other imperceptibly. Sometimes I play back scences and sequences over and over to catch how it happens. In fact, I see it happening and still can't quite figure out how it is done but I have a hunch - DeNiro. DeNiro is just amazing in this film. If you haven't done it already, watch it with the remote in your hand and play some of the scenes in slow motion and you will SEE what I am talking about. Only DeNiro could do what he does. The sheer minimalism of his performance is just stunning. How he gets so much from so little never ceases to amaze me. DeNiro's performance in ""Taxi Driver"" only reminds me of what sports announcer Curt Gowdy exclaimed after one of Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson's incredible plays in the 1970 World Series,""This guy is another world!"""

","A lonely Vietnam veteran who has insomnia spends his nights as a taxi driver in the dirty streets of New York, where he encounters a young prostitute who he tries to help make a difference. <br/><br/>This is a very good film and one of Martin Scorsese best (Goodfellas being my fave). An excellent portrayal from Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle the cabbie and good performances from Jodie Foster as the child prostitute Iris Steensman, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel as a pimp called Sport. <br/><br/>You actually get drawn into the isolation and anger that Travis is feeling towards these lowlifes and because of that you really feel sympathy for him. Though after a while the loneliness and the city really starts to haunt Travis's mind, causing violent instincts and paranoia. <br/><br/>This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle 'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere created. <br/><br/>This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a film. <br/><br/>5/5"
"TomC-5","10","275","366","2 November 1999"," Scorsese's dark masterpiece of urban alienation
","Despite what some might see as limited by technical flaws and/or as an overly simplistic plot, Taxi Driver deserves its critical reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Some 23 years later, the existential plight of Travis Bickle, ""God's lonely man,"" continues to pack a hard emotional punch. In fact, it's hard to know where to begin when praising the elements of this film - such elements as the dark location shots of a (now gone) seedy Times Square, the cinema verite settings of the cabbies and campaign workers, the magnificent Bernard Hermann score, Paul Schrader's fine script, the memorable performances of Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle all must be mentioned. However, the brilliance of this film is primarily a result of the brilliance of De Niro and Scorsese, one of the greatest actor-director teams in movie history. This is an unforgettable film and rates a 10 out of 10, in my estimation."
"DaveDiggler","9","80","102","25 June 2008"," A Descent Into Madness
","""Taxi Driver"" starts off with a beautiful and perfectly fitting score from composer, Bernard Hermann, as we see the blurred city of New York as the fast paced lights from cars and signs are distorted and put into slow motion. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to ""Raging Bull,"" and among the finest acting performances of all time. <br/><br/>Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, ""God's lonely man."" Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. <br/><br/>The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause: Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, ""So long."" As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war."

","So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was, as I have been every single time I've seen it, struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twenty-five years ago. It has not only NOT aged, it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic, and one of the handful of truly great, timeless movies.<br/><br/>Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this, both separately ('The King Of Comedy', 'Light Sleeper') and together ('Raging Bull', 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'), but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend. <br/><br/>Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast, including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel ('Reservoir Dogs'), Peter Boyle ('Hardcore'), the underrated Victor Argo ('The King Of New York') and Joe Spinell ('Maniac'). Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good, and even Cybil Shepherd, the butt of many jokes, is fine as Bickle's obsession.<br/><br/>
When you combine these actors, Schrader's outstanding script, and Scorsese's brilliant direction, with the stunning cinematography (Michael Chapman) and haunting score (Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort), you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple."

","***** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>How would anyone be able to relate to Travis Bickle ? He`s a freak show , a fantasist and a loner who watches porn films in cinemas with a cola in one hand and a candy bar in another and to all intents and purposes is an assassin and a stalker , but he also strikes a cord with any man who`s been angry and young and rejected . He`s an outsider that society has turned its back on : "" Why won`t you talk to me "" is the heartbreaking question every young angry man screams at the world when he`s very alone<br/><br/>
Scorsese directs Paul Schrader`s low concept script on a shoestring budget - That`s not a criticism , quite the reverse because this leads to a hyper-realism and it`d be impossible to think that a major Hollywood studio would produce something like this nowadays where everything is about making money while playing it safe : A character study of a disturbed loner ? 12 year old prostitutes ? Vigilante executions ? Too controversial , not enough explosions , not enough CGI . If there`s a flaw in the screenplay it`s at the end where Travis wipes out the pimp business and becomes a hero which left me confused . Doesn`t society punish murderers even if they kill scum that use 12 year olds as prostitutes ? Even if he was cleared by the jury surely Travis would still have stood trial for murder ? but this is never referred to in the closing scenes , but I guess this is a comment on how society can quickly make a hero out of a villain and how a nobody can become the talk of the town , but still it seems to go against the grain of the script where we - Or at least the young males in the audience - recognise that an uncaring society is the villain where as Travis is the hero all along <br/><br/>Despite the flawed ending of the screenplay ( Which is superb untill the last ten minutes ) this is still a movie masterpiece with Scorsese getting an acting tour de force from his cast . Jodie Foster as a child who sells her body on the streets of New York , a totally disturbing , brilliant performance , and DeNiro and Keitel in the same movie ! I`ve no idea if this is just hype but I heard all the stage schools in the USA were swamped at the time by applications from applicants in Compton , Hell`s Kitchen , South Central and The Bronx who`d seen DeNiro and Keitel in the "" I`m hip "" scene ( A scene that was totally adlibbed by the actors ) and decided that acting could be cool and macho after all . As I said I don`t know how true this is but the performances of these two actors has given a massive amount of credibility to the acting profession and it really is sad to see the DeNiro of today churn out so much garbage . This his greatest performance . I also rate it as Scorsese`s best movie <br/><br/>As a footnote may I recommend to all the angry young men reading this review to track down the albums of Matt Johnson aka The The especially the mid 80s albums SOUL MINING  and INFECTED which have lyrics that could have been written by Travis himself . Matt is a great fan of Scorsese and it shows"

","A nicely made dark and majestic experience, see the world through the eyes of a weird taxi driver, as his character progresses from a total embarrassment to a mad dog. The movie sends a clear message about society and human ego, and how a man's pride can drift him into insanity.<br/><br/>The mood is nice, a prime example on a classic Noir movie, it builds up and prepares you mentally for the big ending.. an ending that failed to live up to the hype that the movie has built in you.. though it had a short yet exciting action scene the ending is pretty simple and is more about delivering a simple message rather than leaving you amazed or satisfied.<br/><br/>The dark comedy in the movie is pretty clear, it shows you how messed up society really is, the movie was executed flawlessly when it comes to cinematic and production, but it will disappoint you at the very end, the ending was just too ""MEH"" to bear, especially after an excellent build of events preceding it, such a pity.<br/><br/>I'm sure the movie was a big hit at the time of its release (after the Vietnam war), but I'm not sure it would be enjoyed the same at our current time, so let me put it this way: - If you enjoy a dark Noir mood with nice character development then watch it now. - If you enjoy movies with subliminal messages then add this one to your ""watch when I have nothing else to watch"" list. - If you're looking for a great story with a nice twist to it, I wouldn't recommend Taxi Driver."
"MovieAddict2016","10","30","42","1 October 2005"," Notes from Above Ground.
","Somewhere in the shadows of the night, hidden within the restraints of his taxicab, a lonely man watches with disgust. His eyes survey the streets with all the malice and passion of a burning fire, his large pupils an open doorway leading into his soul. The demons haunt him; voices in his head convince him that the world is closing in and the only way out is through some form of moral redemption; a physical and emotional catharsis.<br/><br/>The stranger's name is Travis Bickle and he is God's Lonely Man: a discharged Vietnam veteran who wanders the streets at night in a permanent state of confusion and self-loathing.<br/><br/>Travis takes a job as a cab driver to keep out of the porn theaters that have been occupying his time  deciding he might as well get paid for roaming since he does it anyway.<br/><br/>But Travis' filtered input and odd output seems to suggest something is dreadfully wrong. The mild insanity of our protagonist begins to escalate. He approaches an attractive political campaign adviser, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), and asks her out to dinner. She agrees, but the date is cut short when Travis takes her to an X-rated film.<br/><br/>Travis soon meets a young underage prostitute named Iris (a fourteen-year-old Jodie Foster), whom he feels a desire  nay, a need -- to rescue from slavery. Iris' pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), becomes another of Travis' demons.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver was released in 1976 to split praise. Some critics hailed it as a masterpiece, whilst others were a great deal more reserved in their accolade. In Newsweek, Jack Kroll wrote ""() in their eagerness to establish rich and moral ambiguities, the Catholic Scorsese and the Calvinist Schrader have flubbed their ending. It's meant to slay you with irony, but it's simply incredible."" Some critics just hated the film in general and felt the entire runtime was a mess of pretentious storytelling and depressing, gritty themes.<br/><br/>Depressing? Yes. Gritty? Yes. Brilliant? Most definitely. Scorsese does not merely address Travis as a character; he puts us inside his head. And even so, there are instances of abnormality in Scorsese's camera work that suggest paranoia and schizophrenia; moments of displaced subjectivity in which we are neither looking quite through the eyes of Travis nor through those around him, but more at length to his sideyet it seems that his body (primarily his hands) are below us, at the side of the frame, indicating an altered version of the traditional P.O.V.<br/><br/>Scorsese's movie is structured using diverse narrative elements  one of the most prominent being dramatic irony rooted in Greek tragedy (in this case, many set-up and pay-off moments). When Travis exits the brothel for the first time, a Mafioso figure says, ""Come back any time."" Travis responds, ""I will."" We know he will, too, and when he does, that's the pay-off.<br/><br/>Above all else the film is rooted in the basic existentialism philosophies of Berdyaev, Heidegger and Nietzsche. Scorsese later admitted this his toying of genres and philosophy was entirely incidental (""It just felt right"") but one can't help but imagine Schrader may have been influenced by Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, in which our narrator begins, ""I am a sick manI am a spiteful man."" This brings to mind the scene in which Bickle dictates his journal entries to us and delivers an ultimatum to the ""filth"" on the streets, preceded by senseless introspective rambling.<br/><br/>Moving on, the ultimate puzzle of the film: Does our hero live or die? After Travis is shot in the climactic battle, he lies on a sofa, presumably dying, and makes a gesture with his fingers, pretending to shoot himself in the head. The camera pulls up, overhead, and exits the brothel. It then pulls back across the street and up into the heavens, surveying the crowd below.<br/><br/>In the next scene, Travis is alive and well, presented to the world as a hero through the media. Yet as Travis pulls away from the curb at the end of the film, Herrman's familiar four notes (the same ones as used for the final shot of Psycho, implemented when Norman Bates' lack of absolute sanity is finally revealed) come into play. A bell rings. Travis looks in his rearview mirror, as if maybe something caught his eye And then, suddenly, the movie ends.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver's ending cannot be resolved further more than conjecture and opinion. Scorsese himself says on the DVD making-of documentary that he believes the ending is open for analysis. Did Travis live? Did he die? Are the demons on the street still haunting him? Are we meant to sympathize with him and believe he is a hero, or are we meant to refuse him as one? (Or is this our natural reaction against Scorsese's own wishes -- which would explain the negative reviews in '76?) <br/><br/>But it is ultimately the haunting image of Bickle drifting through the endless hordes of nameless people on the streets of Manhattan that lingers with us after the film has ended, and remains the most prescient today. How effortlessly this man can disappear into the multitudes  God's Lonely Man once again alone, alienated and betrayed by the world he has come to loathe. That, above all else, is the most poignant aspect of Taxi Driver."

","""Travis Bickle"" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era ""noirs"" ever made.<br/><br/>Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with ""cleaning up"" New York City.<br/><br/>In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.<br/><br/>Bickle's transformation from a ""disturbed"" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, ""You talking' to me?"" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes I'll never forget.<br/><br/>The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film. <br/><br/>Director Martin Scorcese has made a number of well-known (but not particularly box-office successful) films, and I still think this early effort of his was his best. He's never equaled it, although I think he and De Niro almost pulled it off five years later with another whacked-out character, ""Rupert Pupkin"" In ""The King Of Comedy."" <br/><br/>In any case, there is no debate that Scorcese and De Niro are a great team and that Taxi Driver is one of the most memorable movies of the Seventies."

","Scorsese's best.  Not too many hyper-critical reviews of this film have anything near as intelligent to say about what the director and the screenwriter had in mind when they created this American gem.<br/><br/>To those people that have seen it and thought it was ""slow"" or the pacing was sub par, they don't know what they're talking about; ""Taxi Driver"" is about the gradual and eventual take-over of insanity, and not about violence, action-shoot-'em-up 'slash' car chase... or whatever they expected from it.  The modern audience today is expecting everything--comedy, drama, unbearable suspense, spfx--all rolled-up into one-stop entertainment... and no, I'm not anybody's grandfather, or here to tell you that movies were great in my day, but, viewers, lighten up already.<br/><br/>De Niro, and the rest of the cast, do a serviceable job in this micro-cosmic window into the life of Travis Bickle--a Vietnam vet--who, true, writes mind-numbing entries in his diary, leads a, for the most part, dull existance as a cabbie, and strikes out with a female political campaigner who, after Travis becomes a hero, discovers she is indeed attracted to unstable, sometimes violent chauffeurs.<br/><br/>The rest of this movie's story is for the less initiated viewer; decide whether you've truly become desensitized to sexual and violent content in today's films...

","I mean, seriously. What is it with this movie? I've seen it twice, read stuff about it, got a lecture on it, and I still can't see how anybody could call this movie a masterpiece. So Scorsese shows us a shot of an empty hall while DeNiro is talking on the phone. So what? And is the fact that he constantly makes us aware that we're watching a movie a sign of Scorsese's greatness? Even when it doesn't serve any real purpose??? I particularly dislike the ending - the lack of comment on the violence and the way Travis turns out to be a hero. Is this a critique of violence or a celebration of it? It is clearly not very hard to imagine someone inspired by Travis's resolution to ""clean up the streets"".<br/><br/>Besides, I thought the film was pretty boring.

"Boba_Fett1138","10","22","32","18 February 2006"," An individual's fight- against loneliness and for justice.
","""Taxi Driver"" is a beautiful portrayed of an individual who tries to do things his way, in the hectic and dangerous New York of the '70's. He already isn't a stable person to begin with (he's a Vietnam veteran) but through his loneliness and due to his own personal views and idea's of society and the world, he gets more and more consumed by the rotten society until he feels it is enough and decides to take matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Beauty of the movie is that it gets interpreted by everyone in his or hers own way. Everyone sees some different things in the story and characters. I think this also was what writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese had in mind, while making this movie. <br/><br/>The story takes us into the world of Travis Bickle. We begin to see society through his eyes and we more and more begin to understand the character as the movie progresses. It makes his character not only a understandable one but also a very realistic one. Nothing in this movie is overdone or made to look better or worser than it is in real life.<br/><br/>The movie is made extra powerful through the performances of the cast. Robert De Niro is a sensational main lead and the supporting cast is also real great. Some well known actors that were still unknown at the time of this movie make an appearance, such as a very young Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Victor Argo and an almost unrecognizable young Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>The entire movie is sensational- and with lots of style directed by Martin Scorsese, who knows how to set the right mood and atmosphere. The simple- but effective and realistic from Michael Chapman and the musical score by Bernard Herrmann (his last) also add to the atmosphere. Also of course the fact that New York City serves as the backdrop for this movie, gives the movie a typical dark and gritty feeling and atmosphere. Everything is slowly but powerfully build up in the movie and every sequences plays a significant role. A result of this is that the movie is filled with some unforgettable sequences, of which the famous 'You talking' to me?' sequence is the best known. But also the violent ending leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>It's still a movie that applies today, after 30 years now. Because lets face it, what exactly has been changed in society compared to 30 years ago and now? The subject and meaning of the movie could still apply to present day. It makes ""Taxi Driver"" a timeless and important movie that is a perfect reflection of society and already is worthy of the 'classic'-status. <br/><br/>Yet another essential '70's viewing.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"aurinidmj","3","108","186","22 August 2009"," So open to interpretation that the plot falls out...
","The movie starts off with a mystery man walking into a dingy cab company and applying for a job. Something's off about him, he's friendly on the surface but underneath it there's something stiff and cold. He mentioned the Marine Corp, did something in Vietnam break him? Has he seen too many tragedies, and this waxen face is the most he can muster? Does he see the hookers and pimps, the human slime wandering the streets, and question what he was fighting for? And what about those pills he keeps taking – is there some underlying mental condition? Then, driving around in his cab he sees a woman. He stalks her to her job at a Senator's campaign office, and at first we think there's going to be some sort of conflict here, but then the camera pulls in to focus on her – and she's just as waxen and artificial as he is. Both of them speak with bizarre dialogue, just two degrees off of normal. Eventually he walks in, and they start dating.<br/><br/>Then, another twist – Senator Palpatine *ahem* Palantine gets into his cab one night. When the Senator asks what he cares about, he tries to explain the human vermin wandering the streets. You see fear in the Senator's eyes... but he responds with a greasy quote about working hard and changing the system.<br/><br/>At this point I was intrigued by the movie. I wanted to see how these characters would interact, conflict with each other; I wanted to know why the Taxi Driver was slightly off, and why this woman seemed to mimic him. Was the violence eventually going to be about some political or moral principle? Or will it be an emotional, shattering break down like some sort of Shakespearean tragedy? Unfortunately, none of this came to pass. For some reason he takes the woman on a date to a... porno theatre? In between orgy scenes and Dutch dialogue, there's a microscopic view of sperm fertilizing an egg. Whatever. The girl is initially hesitant, but accedes to watch the film, only to storm out in disgust five minutes later. She then disappears until the ending of the film.<br/><br/>When he gives up on calling her, he starts stalking a 12 year old prostitute. They go for coffee, and he tries to convince her to quit. She calls him a square.<br/><br/>Then he buys a whole bunch of guns and builds a nifty spring-mounted holster for his arm.<br/><br/>Then he talks to a Secret Service agent, then wanders off.<br/><br/>There's a long winded conversation between him and another cab driver – okay, I missed this part because I was busy talking about how many unnecessary scenes there were in this 115 minute long movie – but the bits I did catch didn't seem that critical.<br/><br/>Then we watch a love scene between the 12 year old prostitute and her pimp. It's romantic, and it goes on forever. We have no idea who his character is – he's just 'the pimp.' Then the Taxi Driver shows up planning to shoot Senator Palpatine, screws up and runs away. After that he goes and shoots the pimp, the hotel owner, and a Mafioso. He then tries to commit suicide (never giving the 12 year old the money he'd set aside for her in an earlier scene), but he's out of bullets. For five long, long minutes we watch the camera pan over the bloody scene.<br/><br/>Then we find out that he survived, he's a hero, and the girl went back to his parents. He's back to driving a cab, hanging out with his old cab-driving buddies (who were never fleshed out) then the girlfriend from earlier in the movie asks for a ride. He drives her home, they don't talk, and he doesn't charge her for the fare. Now the movies over.<br/><br/>This movie fills me with rage and confusion. None of the characters are fleshed out, most of them are unnecessary to what little story there is, it's completely unrealistic – not in an artistic 'suspension of disbelief' way, just a stupid way – and I can't discern any point to this movie. Why does he call the street people scum, yet go to watch porn movies every night? What's his fundamental problem? Is he fixed at the end of the movie, and if so, what's fixed about him? All of this build up of him becoming Rambo, only to shoot three guys – and even then, screw that up badly? What about the love scene between the pimp and the 12 year old? Why the politician? And for god's sake, why were there so many dragged out, unnecessary scenes where absolutely nothing happened? 'Open to Interpretation' means that you can use a film/novel/song as a platform to discuss feminism, politics, racism, violence, human nature, and anything else – but the art itself has a distinct strand to it. This movie does not. It's sort of like the late-era Beatles' songs where they just slapped together random words... only those were at least entertaining and contained emotion. This movie had none of that. The only emotion it successfully conveyed was alienation – because I'm sure as hell feeling alienated right now.<br/><br/>Deep existential questions are troubling my soul – if such ugliness as this can exist, than does beauty even matter anymore? This film is so ugly, sad, and broken that compared to it the most vigorous celebration of youth, love, and beauty is nothing but whistling in the dark as the universe dissolves into entropy, a featureless room-temperature void...<br/><br/>I don't know if I'll ever feel joy again. Even the blue soulful depths of melancholy are a sweet fruit which will forever be gone from my life. It's with my last act of will and human charity that I beseech you – if you love yourself, then please – Don't watch Taxi Driver!"

I can't, for the life of me, see how these people would give this certified dud 8 & 10-star ratings.<br/><br/>I mean, Taxi Driver's story was less than interesting. There wasn't a single likable character in the whole lot of these NYC losers. The directing was, for the most part, very amateurish and inconsistent. And the violence was, at times, almost laughable.<br/><br/>This, to me, was not in any way a satisfying movie-experience, yet people seem to, literally, fall all over themselves, heaping unwarranted praise on it.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that most of these people who love Taxi Driver to pieces are probably now in their 50s and 60s.<br/><br/>These people saw this film when it was first released in movie theaters back in 1976.

Or maybe that's the alure for some people. If you look at the votes for this thing people either love it or hate it. I'm mostly indifferent. The problem I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his ""instability"" is! Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. Awwww, poor thing. Well neither can I, and a lot of people can't sleep at nights. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? Nope. The truth is, we don't know what his problems stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't as an audience connect with. Good performances overall don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overrated drama.

"JoeKulik","2","45","77","21 May 2015"," Taxi Driver (1976)-A Film With A Fatally Flawed Storyline
","I watched Taxi Driver (1976) a couple of years ago & thought that it was a film with a fatally flawed storyline that didn't really deserve the big box office response & all the critical accolades it got.<br/><br/>However, now that I've just viewed Taxi Driver a second time, I must report that I STILL feel that it's a film with a storyline SO flawed that there is JUST NO WAY that I can consider it much more than a mediocre film, at best.<br/><br/>True enough, Taxi Driver is a film with some great qualities. The cinematography is exciting & innovative. The acting of the WHOLE cast is really superior.<br/><br/>However, all the great qualities of this film are for nothing, as far as I'm concerned, because, at least for me, if a film has a story line that is fundamentally flawed, then that just makes the rest of the film pointless. True enough, there plenty of fine films out there with improbable characters &/or improbable storyline elements where through good acting, & good direction they were able to pull off at least a semi-plausible, or semi-believable film. However, there are fatal flaws in the storyline of Taxi Driver that no amount of good acting or good direction would ever be able to overcome.<br/><br/>1) That cabbie Travis would take beautiful, educated, impeccably dressed, upscale campaign executive Betsy to a hard core porn movie on their first date is just STUPID. Look, Travis spent time in the Marines & he has a reputation of being the only cabbie who will take fares even to the roughest parts of NYC without getting into trouble, so he has lots of life experience & lots of ""street smarts"". Moreover, his social boldness in walking in off the street to talk to upscale Betsy, & his smooth, seductive language when he is wooing her in the campaign office & then again in the coffee shop belies a level of social sophistication that is beyond the narrative of this film. So why is a guy like Travis, who apparently has so much ""on the ball"" STUPIDLY taking an educated, upscale gal like Betsy to a hard core porn movie on their first date?<br/><br/>2) That Travis begins to get deranged & delusional after Betsy blows him off, & that he buys a number of guns, & starts to systematically stalk candidate Palatine & then, after his assassination attempt fails that he goes to rescue adolescent prostitute Iris, killing several guys in the process is pure BS. Having a BA & a MA in Psychology, I can tell you that mental illness just doesn't work that way. If Travis spent such a long time plotting the assassination of Palatine, then no simple foiled assassination attempt would allow him to focus his obsessiveness elsewhere. In reality, a paranoid borderline psychotic like Travis would just regroup for another attempt to kill the object that he has been stalking for so long, not just ""turn on a dime"" & choose a new object to kill.<br/><br/>3) That Travis is a deranged guy who has been plotting the murder of a Presidential candidate for a long time, & then starts a caring, empathetic relationship with the kid prostitute Iris is just from outer space. A guy who is as twisted as Travis, who spends 24/7 obsessed with killing a prominent person just doesn't take a ""mental health vacation"" & goes to express concern to a teenage hooker & has a rational conversation with her. SORRY, but the severe mental illness that Travis was exhibiting after Betsy blew him off just can't be switched on & off that way.<br/><br/>4) That Travis is hailed in the newspapers as a ""hero"" after he murders 4 bad guys while ""rescuing"" Iris is just STUPID. a) Replete with his Mohawk haircut, & unconscious to boot when the cops arrived after the big shootout, Travis would've been pegged as a bad guy who was in a shootout with other bad guys, & as a lowly NYC cabbie Good Luck talking your way out that corner. b) Even if the cops & the DA did recognize that Travis was not a bad guy but a misguided vigilante ala Bernard Goetz, chances are good that he'd still end up in prison for murder because not even bona fide cops have the legal authority to have the type of self initiated, unprovoked shoot out with the bad guys that Travis had.<br/><br/>5) That elegant, beautiful, educated, upscale, uptown Betsy actually seeks out the lowly cabbie Travis & makes overtures to him at the end of the film is UNREAL enough in itself but that Travis blew her off & just drove away leaving her standing in the street is just FANTASTIC, UNBELIEVABLE, & the stuff of children's FAIRY TALES not of an adult feature film.<br/><br/>For these reasons, & others, I must conclude that Taxi Driver is an otherwise OK film but with an ill conceived, bush league storyline that is not even worthy of a B-movie, much less international film awards. Obviously, writer Paul Schrader did no research on the complex personality that was the centerpiece of his screenplay."
"ScottAmundsen","1","78","141","18 June 2013"," Why This Film is a Classic is a Profound Mystery
","Martin Scorsese is one of those directors whose work I just don't seem to get. His films are not totally inaccessible, like most of the work of Stanley Kubrick, but sitting through a Scorsese production is often an exercise that pendulums back and forth between crashing boredom and utter incomprehensibility.<br/><br/>Of course, everyone knows by now that TAXI DRIVER is about isolation. Specifically the isolation of one man in the midst of a bustling city. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Viet Nam veteran, applies for a job driving a taxi in New York on the graveyard shift; the reason he gives for wanting the job is that he does not sleep at night. That anyone would hire him to actually drive a vehicle under those conditions seems odd, but then everything about Bickle is odd. Clearly he suffers from a profound sense of isolation, but most of that is of his own making, since when it comes to social interaction this guy is so clueless that he makes burnout Reverend Jim from the television show ""Taxi"" seem like Albert Einstein by comparison.<br/><br/>Travis finds himself attracted to Betsy, a woman working on the presidential campaign of a politician (Cybill Shepherd, proving yet again that she cannot act her way out of a cream puff factory), and he has sufficient social skills to get her to agree to a movie date. Then he takes her to a XXX porn film. Of course she cannot get out of there fast enough, and he is totally bewildered; in his mind it was a perfect date movie.<br/><br/>A good deal of the story is told via Travis's inner thoughts, spoken by De Niro on the soundtrack. This device was old even in 1976, and there is too much of it; the audience is already alienated from this man, and having his thoughts overdubbed places him even farther from anything remotely approaching understanding.<br/><br/>Possibly the best scenes in the movie are the ones with Jodie Foster as Iris, a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis attempts to rescue from what he sees as a sordid life. Iris is possibly the most interesting person in the film; Foster plays her as a girl walking a tightrope between what she has to do to survive and the necessity to avoid danger; she is receptive to Travis at first, but even a twelve-year-old can see that this guy is not playing with a full deck. And at least she breathes some life into an unbearably tedious movie.<br/><br/>Which brings us to De Niro. He's good here, but he's much better elsewhere; watching him I had the impression that Scorsese went to one of two extremes: either he gave the actor no direction at all and let him do as he pleased, or he micromanaged every nuance of the character and in the process sucked the life out of it. Whatever, the result is a stilted and peculiar bit of acting that seems beneath a major talent like De Niro. Yes, we get Travis's isolation, but we never know what caused it, or why he is just so damn WEIRD.<br/><br/>And of course, as is Scorsese's habit, all of this is presented under the guise of ""gritty reality"" (think GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL, both of which ram ""gritty reality"" down the viewer's throat until the urge to run screaming from the theater is almost overwhelming).<br/><br/>I am a native of New York City; I was born there and lived there until I was forty-two. Martin Scorsese is also a native of the City, but I do not recognize the picture of NYC he paints in this film at all. The simple answer is that we are seeing the City through Travis Bickle's eyes, but while he describes what he sees, we never find out WHY he sees things the way he does; it is perhaps the most frustrating aspect of a very frustrating film.<br/><br/>Great film? Depends on which critic you ask. The late Roger Ebert loved it. Leonard Maltin thinks it's awful. I suspect that, like most of Scorsese's oeuvre, this is one of those movies you either love or you hate. Well, I didn't exactly HATE it, but most of it is insufferably boring. De Niro presents us with a wacko character but fails to provide a provenance for his behavior. About the only good thing I can say about Cybill Shepherd is that her role is brief; she's absolutely PAINFUL to watch. It is only Jodie Foster, all of twelve years old yet wearing an ancient expression in her eyes that tells the story of where this girl has been, that draws and holds the audience's attention; honestly, without Foster the film would have no life at all.<br/><br/>And possibly the worst of it is that Bickle's increasing descent into violence is left totally unexplained. It would be easy to assume that it was his Viet Nam service that unhinged him, but the movie does not play that way and at any rate if that were the case it would have been an easy matter to communicate it. To put it in five short words, this film is a mess."
"classicsoncall","9","11","16","16 April 2011"," ""Here is a man who would not take it anymore"".
","In a calculated exercise, I watched ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" back to back today. Two classics, and two films generally recognized by critics and fans to be among the best of all time. Personally, I think Bull was the better showcase for both De Niro and director Scorsese as the four years between films allowed both to improve on their respective crafts. In terms of favorites, that might be a moot point, as both are darkly disturbing and violent films, with main characters that aren't particularly honorable, much less likable.<br/><br/>Indeed, both characters, the fictional Travis Bickle and the real life Jake La Motta were haunted by personal demons that manifested as forms of mental illness. La Motta's brand of violence was legal inside the ring, what he carried into his personal life resulted in a lifetime of unintended consequences. The outcomes of fictional characters can be manipulated to suit the priority of the writer or director, so in the case of ""Taxi Driver"", the protagonist winds up as sort of a hero, at least to the parents of twelve year old hooker Iris. I'm not sure if the point of the film had anything to do with showing how one's life can turn on a second's notice or not. However when Bickle's assassination attempt on Palantine (Leonard Harris) was foiled, the succeeding events could have led to his own demise. Instead he's reborn, sort of. One could sequel the story after Betsy (Cybil Shepherd) gets a cab ride from Travis at the end of the picture, but it's probably better left to the viewer's imagination.<br/><br/>A tiny detail caught my eye in both pictures today which I'm sure I would never have considered had I seen them days or weeks apart. In the carnage of the shootout scene, when the cops make their presence in the doorway of the rented room, Bickle puts a bloody finger to his head simulating a gunshot, and two drops of blood drip from his finger. Scorsese used the same device again in ""Raging Bull"", when Jake La Motta is badly bloodied in his final fight against Sugar Ray Robinson. As the boxer sags against the ring ropes, the camera focuses on the top rope a few inches away from La Motta's outstretched arm. Two drops of blood fall from the rope to the canvas to further intensify La Motta's defeat. At the time, I couldn't say why I found that to be so fascinating, but now I do."

","I just watched Taxi Driver (1976)<br/><br/>De Niro is Travis Brickle a lonely man with little social skills, who lives alone in New York. He works nights as he is struggling to sleep, possibly due to PSTD from the war to some other incident we do not know about, we never find out, we only know his military history. When he is amongst his fellow taxi drivers he has a child like shyness (He never speaks unless he is spoken to, and often zones out of conversation) that eventually begins to give way to anger.<br/><br/>We see everything from Travis's point of view, he hates the city and the scum in it, we get lots of tracking shots of the city, the vile people in the streets and of a lonely De Niro slowly walking through the streets alone and constantly writing in his journal.<br/><br/>After stalking/following a crush Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) he starts to have a relationship with the lady (these are the only times in the movie, where he seems remotely happy), only for him to react badly when he is rejected.<br/><br/>He becomes further upset with his failure to help a 12 year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) under attack from her pimp (Harvey Kietel) At some point he stops taking his medication and with guns he obtained through a co worker (He first uses a gun in self defence during an armed robbery in a convenience store) he starts planning something, but we are not sure what. All we know is he writes he will be dead by the time Iris reads his letter.<br/><br/>After having a radical make over and then becoming violent including murdering 3 men, he is perceived as a hero by the public, even though he did not do it to be a hero, and does not think of himself as such.<br/><br/>It's a slow burn and seriously depressing movie, it stays with you long after you have watched it. All the cast are great, it has an amazing score and you must watch this movie."
"batmanorgiants","10","3","3","22 July 2019"," Probably the most uncomfortable I've ever felt watching a movie.
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is famous and infamous for a lot of reasons. Questions over whether or not Travis is a lunatic, an intelligent cunning man who knows what he wants, or a depressed man trying to gain revenge on a world that doesn't like him and which he doesn't like in return ( I personally believe it's the third one) or the countless theories that the ending is a dream sequence/ a hint he's a violent ticking time bomb that will strike again as a hero or the villain he originally attended to go out as. But what stuck me the most about the movie was his characteristics. You see, when I first started watching the movie, I got a sense that the intelligent, observant, insightful man Travis was trying to show to world, and by extension the audience was full of crud. Why? Because I act and lash out the same way as he does. The projection he lays out to Betsy explaining to her that ""all the telephones in her office doesn't hide her loneliness"" , his uncalled for criticism of her coworker, his obsession to Betsy bleeding into his lust to kill the senator. These are all things I can see myself doing I've tried to convince myself and other romantic interests of how sophisticated I am when in reality I don't stand by anything. Notice how Travis has no interest in politics but yet tries to act as if he has any interest in what his significant other is passionate about in order to impress her. But when she asks him basic questions of his policies, his mask cracks. He has the charisma to breeze over the questions but that still doesn't excuse the fact that this is a man without a true identity. All he knows is hate. Hatred for how Betsy treated him, hatred for his fellow taxi drivers acceptance of the destructiveness that happens around them, hatred towards Sports manipulation of Iris. All he wants to do is push his pain and hatred to other people. This is the only reason he planned to kill the senator. He just wanted Betsy to feel what he was feeling. He's no hero: everything he did was selfish and it was for himself. He never wanted to be seen as anything or condemned/ praised for his actions. He just wanted to cause misery and die. His ""saving"" of Iris wasn't even wanted by her: he only did it so he can feel accomplished in completing a mission that will, in his mind, will lead him to die from the gangsters or through suicide. He fails and he's left to suffer again. It's almost as if the film is warning me over my self destructive behavior. My treatment of women is similar to that of Travis albeit a lot less violent and extreme. However the consequences can still be as dire. Loneliness, suffering, and self hatred manifested in a lust to cause others the same pain. I am grateful of how Robert was able to portray a depressed and isolated man in a such a believable and terrifying manner. Everything from his snide tone to his devilish smirk leads to one of the greatest performances I have ever had the privilege of watching. I absolutely detest and hate all of the characters in the movie, especially Travis, but to me that's only because of how personal this story feels to me. It surely is a masterpiece of a movie and I highly recommend watching it. 10/10"

The story revolves around a lonely 26 years old taxi driver that was a loner and outcast and clearly have physcological issues. His ill-conceived atttempts to woo a young women named Betsy backfired and push him finally into mental instability.<br/><br/>Then as if suddenly realizing that there is clearly nothing much in both the script and the story line in this sorry excuse for a movie, the Director saw fit to inject the last 10 mins with a meaningless violent bloody gunfight. The entire movie is so meaningless that people must be blind to rate this as a classic.<br/><br/>I urge anyone thinking of renting or buying this movie to think twice.

","On the cloudy, hazy streets of New York City, a single yellow beacon stands out. A lonely, insomniac, mentally unstable cab driver does his job. All while plotting to cleanse the city of ""human trash."" Welcome to a real-life nightmare: Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>With an omniscient feeling of loneliness (symbolized by a taxi) present in Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), our anti-hero protagonist has his one element that anybody who has ever experienced loneliness in their life can relate to. However, anyone who shoots up a brothel and attempts to assassinate a senator is by no means a role model. Travis Bickle (despite his one trait that an audience can relate to) is such an emotionally disturbed person that he sees very irrational actions as perfectly sane, making him a danger to himself and to other people. The phenomenal score by Bernard Herrmann (known for composing scores for Alfred Hitchcock from 1956-1964) reflects everything about Travis. His insanity, loneliness, bigotry, and instability are all represented in a way that hypnotizes the listener in a cocktail of sound.<br/><br/>Travis is a man that has nothing to live for in life. His infatuation with Betsy is doomed to go nowhere. He feels the need to lie to his parents (in the form of a letter) to make his life look better than the boring reality. Travis cannot discern rationally what deeds are right or wrong and, quite frankly, I doubt that he cares.<br/><br/>The climactic final shootout (which threatened to give this movie a X rating) is an intense scene that has not lost an ounce of power today. As a kid born in the mid-90's, I can only imagine what effect images like a man having his hand blown apart by Travis's Magnum .45 had on 1976 audiences. The scene also drives home the extent of Travis's fragile mental state.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a masterwork from Martin Scorsese. Possibly even THE masterwork (GoodFellas and Raging Bull create tough company) of his entire career. A disturbing wonder (more so for me as I am a high- functioning autistic) of the cinema that is telling of our society and of the human psyche. There are few classics in cinema that have withstood the test of time (in terms of multiple decades) in a way in which they have only become more relevant than when they were initially released. ""Taxi Driver"" is certainly one such movie."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","14","23","13 March 2009"," A Masterpiece
","Taxi Driver (1976) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Scorsese's masterpiece is a raw, powerful and nerve wrecking look at depression and loneliness. The film centers on taxi driver Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a man clearly with his own demons who finds a purpose in life when he meets a 12-year-old hooker (Jodie Foster) who he plans on saving from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). To me this is one of the richest films ever made and it's one that can easily be overlooked in some circles if you don't really connect to what the film is trying to say. I didn't care too much for the movie the first few times I watched it because I was too young to really understand depression and loneliness. After I understood what those things could do to a person is when I fully became aware of the power in this film and today it remains one of the most powerful films ever made. To me the entire film is pretty much about Travis trying to find someone to fit in with but of course it never really happens until he meets the hooker. He tries fitting in with the Cybill Shepherd character but falls flat on his face. He tries fitting in with his co-workers but that doesn't work out too well. No matter what Travis tries he keeps ending up alone and as he put it, he's God's lonely man. This film works on so many levels but I think the psychological one is where it's best at. Getting us into the mind of Travis works for many reasons but the biggest keys are the direction by Scorsese, the brilliant music score by Bernard Herrmann and DeNiro's groundbreaking performance. Putting those three things together is what makes this a classic but we can also throw in the screenplay by Paul Schrader, which rightfully gives the movie the time and patience to let the Travis character grow right in front of our eyes. DeNiro's performance is certainly one for the ages, although I think he would get even better with Scorsese's RAGING BULL, which would follow in four years. His performance here is nothing short of amazing because you can't help but be terrified by this guy because of the look in DeNiro's eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for him at the same time because there are countless moments where he embarrasses himself because he simply doesn't know how to fit in. The word anti-hero gets used a lot and perhaps that's a good term but I think it's something much deeper than that. DeNiro hits all the right marks without a false note anywhere. Foster is also impressive in her few scenes in the film as is Keitel as the pimp. Shepherd is also good as his Albert Brookes and the underrated Peter Boyle who has one of the best scenes in the movie where he's trying to talk some sense into Travis. The visual look of the film is mighty impressive and Scorsese's directing style is nothing short of amazing. The slimy looking streets and the dark atmosphere are one of a kind and something many films tried to copy but could never get it as perfect as it is here. This here remains one of the greatest American films ever made and I'm really not sure any movie could top it in showing the effects that loneliness can have on a person."
"CineCritic2517","1","43","85","7 September 2013"," An insufferable bore
","De Niro plays You-talkinna-me Travis Bickle, a loner and a socially inept New York City cabby who takes the job because 'he cannot sleep at night'. As Travis sees more and more of the filth and depredation on the streets he tours, he turns to violence in an attempt to better the world.<br/><br/>The movie is insufferably slow and repetitive while it channels the impressions Travis gets moonlighting the streets of New York. The dialog throughout the film feels unnatural and hammy and sucks the life out of an otherwise potentially interesting watch. There's also not much of a plot here which makes the 2 hour viewing quite a challenge. Foster does well but simply isn't believable as a child prostitute working for a pimp played by Keitel. Keitel himself also fails to convince due to the lackluster and rather phony script. Shepherd makes a short and forgettable appearance as Travis his love interest and seems to be cast only for her pretty eyes and patented stare.<br/><br/>Though wonderfully moody and well filmed, Taxi Driver is at its core an uninteresting character piece that goes on too long and tells us too little. The music score consists of variations on two jazzy reprises by Bernard Herrmann that are set on repeat throughout the film. When after an hour you hear it being played for the gazillionth time, it starts to become more than a little silly."

","I watched this movie with some friends and family after hearing some positive things about it. I figured that a highly acclaimed film with Robert Deniro couldn't be bad; I was wrong. The plot never seems to satisfy or even make sense. Why does he talk to the Secret Service guy? Why's he trying to kill Palantine? Why is he a hero for taking the law into his own hands? How does killing a few pimps bring him back his sanity, when the sleaze and filth he loathes is still all around him? And, really, what's with the mohawk? <br/><br/>I really don't understand the hype with this movie. Poor script, poor cohesion, but maybe that's what you get with a psycho for a main character. (The conversation between Travis and ""Wizard"" outside next to the cab is mind bogglingly incoherent.) <br/><br/>Only Deniro's acting saved this from receiving a 1."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Readers of my other comments know that I believe that there are different types of films, depending on whether the skeleton is the writer's, the actor's, or the camera's. The more I use it, the more confidence I have that in general, one drives out the other. Just before reseeing this, I worked on `One-Eyed Jacks,' which is probably the touchstone of the actor driving out the eye.<br/><br/>But here, we have a happy accident of three talents that don't step on each other: DeNiro, Schrader and Scorsese. Of these, Schrader is the strongest and every deviation from his vision weakens the fabric. The one main example is Keitel's dance with Jodie.<br/><br/>The key device here is that the narrator is Bickle. Everything is/must be something he personally witnesses (until his death) and reports to us. The idea is far from novel. Why it works here is Scorsese's intuition to play the camera OFF of Bickle, while De Niro works to keep the attention on him. That tension (which Schrader intended) is what makes this work.<br/><br/>But this is not perfect. Keitel, like De Niro doesn't get this dynamic; we don't want De Niro to, that would ruin the main device because we want him to pull to himself against the camera. But when Keitel does his stuff, it has a negative effect because there is no narrative countermeasure..<br/><br/>Foster's presence was good enough when this film was new because the very idea of a 12 year old whore was enough. But seeing it a quarter century later, you can see her thinness compared to the rest of the cast. They really understand their characters and crawl into them. She has no idea, none at all.<br/><br/>Another problem is the cab metaphor. Paul didn't quite center that one. He did get it right later with the ambulance in `Bringing Out the Dead,' which used the same energy of selfish actor pulling one way and camera pulling another way. But that time, they fought over the vehicle at the same time they fought in your mind. And of course that had De Palma's eye.<br/><br/>Finally, the camera we see here has energy, but far less than what Scorsese's buddy De Palma was doing at this time. Imagine what De Palma (or Hitchcock) would have done with that angel shot after the massacre."

","Taxi Driver is one of my all-time favorite movies. Each time I see it, I am absolutely amazed at De Niro's genius. Perhaps no other actor can better portray this, or most other characters, at least those that require a great deal of talent and the ability to really become the character. De Niro never fails to amaze, and Taxi Driver is far from being an exception. The main protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle, is an alienated, slightly psychotic Vietnam veteran-and NYC cab driver-who being absolutely disgusted with his surroundings (at night driving a cab through all parts of the city), takes it upon himself to save a very young prostitute, Iris,( played by Jodie Foster)from all the ""scum"" (recurrent theme)-and the life of a prostitute, including a pimp. He also falls in love with a woman who works on a political campaign for a fictional senator, Palantine. Although he fails to win her over, he does attempt to assassinate Palantine..perhaps he wants to be a hero, or to save his love interest from what he regards as a useless environment. The recurrent theme is clear throughout the film- Bickle attempts to help those with whom he becomes obsessed, from an environment that disgusts him. Paradoxically, however, the lonely, useless character becomes regarded as a hero, for going to great lengths to save the object of his obsession (Iris). Taxi Driver takes you through the mind and reasoning of a lonely, obsessive man, and his attempts to bring justice to those who ultimately do not understand or care for him."
"rmax304823","8","10","16","29 March 2009"," Urban Anomi.
","A truly disturbing movie. Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro), great name, falls into a mood of brooding, amorphous rage and is frustrated in his attempts to murder a politician. So he wipes out a couple of low-life pimps instead.<br/><br/>The story tracks him through his descent into insanity. Interesting folks are encountered along the way but have less impact than rubber bumpers have on a pinball. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle, for instance. Boyle is one of a handful of taxi drivers, like DeNiro, who gather at a certain café to shoot the breeze on breaks. He's particularly funny in his working-class disinclination to think things through. ""Them queers"" have to get married and divorced in California, he says wonderingly. I saw this in the Castro Theater in San Francisco and the audience erupted in laughter. When DeNiro asks for advice and gets nonsense in response, Boyle asks, ""What do you want, Bertrand Russell?"" <br/><br/>The film is unusual for Martin Scorsese. His most successful work has been with solidary groups, like small time hoods and the Mafia, in which there is an agreed-upon set of rules, and everyone knows everyone else. This one digs into urban anomie. ""Anomi"" is a concept developed by the French sociologist Emile Durkheim and it means, essentially, ""without rules."" It's the kind of thing you experience when you drive into a vast strip mall parking lot and all the yellow lines guiding traffic have been erased. What do I do NOW, Ma? <br/><br/>Scorsese is examining a social world that, as an Italian Catholic, he really has had little contact with. The film was written by Paul Schrader who, as an ex-Calvinist, is a little more familiar with this sort of ontological anxiety. It crops up in the production design. When DeNiro makes his unfulfilling meeting with Jody Foster, the twelve-year-old whore, it collapses in misunderstanding but in the background there are a multitude of Catholic candles. The climactic scene has a voice reading a letter to DeNiro from Foster's square Midwestern parents, congratulating him for an act that was ancillary to his own agenda, which was evidently to bring the world down around his ears.<br/><br/>A film of the 1970s, it resonates less with audiences today. The racial troubles that were so headline-grabbing at the time show up less often in the news today. Not that the problem of race is solved, but the categorical thinking that divided us into two warring tribes has less relevance. The resentment simmers but has been cut off at the ankles, partly by our recent election of an African-American to the highest office in the nation. At the same time we have to admit that, as a nation, we are pustular with hatred for each other and for other countries that may not behave the way we want them to. Our leading presidential candidate has made it clear that he will go to war with Iran if Iran doesn't give up its nuclear ambitions. These attitudes come from the same place as Travis Bickle's. <br/><br/>Most powerful shot in the movie: the camera slowly moves in on a bubbling glass of Alka Seltzer on the table in front of Robert DeNiro. All that fizzing is but one step removed from the explosion that is to follow."

"graham-290","2","26","55","30 December 2005"," This is the type of film I like, and I didn't enjoy it at all
","I like character studies, I like De Niro, I like urban movies. <br/><br/>Given that, I was somewhat embarrassed to have reached 38 years old and not managed to see a film much ballyhooed as a classic. Instead, I should have been thankful. It's not just that the pacing is slow, the music vaguely irritating, and the story lacking.<br/><br/>The problem is that a character study needs to be about someone who *has* a character. We need to see development and we need to care about them. Travis doesn't have a well defined character. His mental instability ebbs and flows, is never properly defined (probably a good idea from the director's viewpoint), and his actions seem random rather than prompted by illness. Does rejection by a ""good"" person make him re-classify everyone as bad and lead to his vigilante-ism? Or is he attempting to re-cast Iris as a ""good"" person? Who knows? Certainly not the viewer as no clues are given.<br/><br/>Even if we draw a veil over that issue, and the ludicrous idea that he would be seen as a hero for deliberately killing several people, the lack of rationale for, well, anything, makes empathy with the title character impossible. Frankly, there is no reason to care what happens to him, and so, ultimately, no reason to watch this movie.<br/><br/>""Rocky"" roundly trounced Taxi Driver at the Oscars. Well done, class of '77"

","***** WARNING: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>Well, what can I say? Taxi Driver is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The other facts contributing to the facts that everyone seems to love this movie is absolutely mind-boggling. <br/><br/>First off, the film has absolutley no plot. It's a bunch of stuff that happens. The scenes have no meaning and are very boring. Second, Jodie Foster is credited right after Rob DeNiro. She appears in the movie for about 4 minutes total (literally). Third, the ""extreme graphic violence"" in the movie is nothing more than a little bit of ketchup and water in the last 5 minutes from a few bullets. And last, the score really, really sucks. Admit it, it does. <br/><br/>When I first heard about Taxi Driver, I was very excited. From all the reviews that said ""It was the most realistic film ever made"" or some such thing. Then I saw it and realized it was one of the most unrealistic films ever made, as well as awful. Mr. Scorcese, if you ever read this, my advice is: when you want to do a ghetto movie, let somebody who knows what he's talking about do it."

","As a modern viewer of this, many plot lines and themes seem quite familiar, from the Veteran feelings presented in Rambo, to the over all dream like substance of the smooth jazz and late 70's aesthetic shown in Joker. The key to this all, is that this movie came first, so while watching it with that modern lens makes it feel less original and less of a classic, truly it shows just why it is a great film and has the renown that it deserves. For, without this film, many modern films that we know and love today may have been very different, if exist at all. The movie has one feeling the natural unease that comes with watching those around them be corrupted and destroyed while at the same time one of them is trying to soothe you and tell you that everything is going to be all right. It's strange, it's uncomfortable, but in the end it truly is great."

","""You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here.""
This line highlights one of the film's most significant themes...loneliness. The story is about former Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who is suffering from mental health problems and toxic masculinity. The first time we meet him is during his attempt to become a Taxi Driver stating to the manager that he specifically needs the job because he can't sleep at nights. Taxi Driver is considered one of the best character studies in cinema with Scorsese's direction playing a major part in it as we, the audience feel Travis' loneliness and anxiety every time he stares at a couple or a potential criminal. Scorsese puts us in Travis' point of view by having us look through his eyes using slow motion in order to make us focus wherever Travis is focusing and it's through the way he watches and observes several people that we start getting in his head. The beauty of Taxi Driver lies with the amount of information the audience receives for its main character by simply looking at the screen and noticing how the camera works and where it focuses. Whereas a movie nowadays would simply build its character through dialogue and/or exposition, Taxi Driver through Scorsese's brilliant direction and Michael Chapman's beautiful and informative cinematography allows us to know Travis without ever hearing a word of dialogue. One would argue about the fact the film has a background narration of Travis' journal entries, although that is merely used as a tool of exploring some of his thoughts, operating more as a companion to the film's main series of events while also adding to the film's noir aesthetic, instead of being an exposition dump about plot. Examples of the film's brilliant visual storytelling that convey character are scenes like the one with Travis on the phone trying to earn Betsy back as the camera pans to an empty hallway, as if the camera had a personality of its own and was embarrassed watching our protagonist's pointless and humiliating attempts or the scene in the coffee shop where he is distracted from the bubbles of his glass, showcasing his inner anger that boils within him and how cut off from the rest of the group he is or even the scene where he watches a movie, in which a man gets dumped by his girlfriend, with Travis throwing the TV on the ground breaking it because he is reminded of Betsy dumping him. There are so many more scenes with brilliant camera work that give the audience information about who Travis is and how he perceives the world, whether we're talking about the way he is so turned on by guns and the idea of enacting his crusade of blood, to the way he views black people as potential pimps/criminals without having enough context to back this up. Bernard Hermann's score creates a dream like aesthetic with his jazzy soundtrack that is often calm and romantic but hides an unsettling undertone of horror, hinting at the film's initial romantic feel that will later be swapped with a depressing journey of loneliness, despair and a cynical quest for self-discovery.
Besides the technical aspects of the film that make it such a masterful character study, the other reason I love Taxi Driver is the themes it explores through its not-that-much intellectual but relatable antihero. Chapman's masterful portrayal of 1970's New York with the production design of the film being so realistic (because it was 100% real) summarize the film's case study: the decadence and degradation of post-Vietnam America and what that does to a person. Assuming Travis is indeed an honorable discharged and didn't just lie about it so that he can be more respected and accepted (notice the manager's reaction in the opening when Travis mentions he was an honorable discharged), the film tries to explore the world's now-greatest city that back then was a cesspool of prostitution, drug dealing and crime. Paul Schrader, who wrote the script drawing from his own similar to Travis' experiences, does a masterful job of realistically portraying the psychology of a lone male with a lack of basic socializing skills that is so frustrated not only with the city's decadence but with the alienation of his urban environment. The film is one of the most powerful experiences I've ever felt in film because it rarely dramatizes the things it wants to show. It is as real as it gets from a simple interaction with a woman at the beginning, that leads to Travis' brutal rejection to a robbery, that leads to Travis simply shooting a man without second's hesitation as he worries about not having a permit for his gun, with the store owner brutally beating the dead corpse of the robber with a crowbar afterwards. Everything seems so shocking because everything seems so real. The film is more reliant on the character and his actions and less on the plot, which involves two women that throughout the film Travis tries to befriend and ""save"" from other males that seem to ""own"" them. Betsy, the first woman that Travis seems to perceive as his get-away to a life devoid of loneliness and despair, rejects him (having initially won her over) after he takes her to a porno theater simply because he had seen other couples attending the theater, making him think it was ok. And that's where his basic lack of socializing skills starts to kick in, with the audience realizing his innocence, since we know it's his ignorance and not his intentions that made him take such a bad and idiotic decision and Betsy seems to understand that too: ""We're just different"" she says, as she gets into a Taxi and abandons him. Later on, Travis decides to approach Iris, a 12-year old prostitute that he swaps Betsy for. What seems to connect these two female characters is the male figures behind them. Betsy is working at the campaign office of Charles Palantine, a senator that campaigns for president of America. Although the two might have not met in person, it's the way Betsy describes and idolizes Palantine that shows us how he has put a spell on her, preventing her from realizing the truth Travis witnesses every night. To Travis, Palantine is the personification of politicians and although the film never idolizes or condemns him, it's not that hard to understand Scorsese's and Schrader's view on him (and thus their view on politicians). You simply have to look at the streets of the city that Travis roams all night...which we perfectly do. Travis thinks he knows better (even if he doesn't follow political issues that closely) and so do we, as we share his anger and just wonder how can Betsy be so attracted by someone she doesn't know and is responsible for the city's condition as opposed to a guy that was prepared to do anything for her and simply made a mistake out of his own ignorance. Taking a woman at a porno theater on the first (or any) date is indeed a bit unforgivable but we feel Travis' frustration as we probably had some sort of similar experience. Getting dumped by a woman for doing something inappropriate as a result of inexperience (first date anyone?) is totally realistic with the film simply presenting an extreme situation. Iris and her ""protective"" male figure on the other hand, are the film's more literal representations of decadence. A pimp that manipulates a 12-year old girl into being a drug addicted prostitute with their relationship being more direct and intimate compared to Betsy's and Palantine's non-physical and distant connection. Travis perceives his role as ""God's Lonely Man"" as he attempts to fill his empty life with some sort of purpose. He failed to be with his angelic savior Betsy so now the only mission that gives him some sort of purpose is to stand up against the evils of the world and become a hero. His interest is not in Iris but in the man behind her. She is just an excuse for him to go to war with the scum he is so disgusted by.
And so by the end, after a brutal and shockingly violent shoot-out, that lacks any dramatization and is as realistic as the rest of the film, Travis is hailed as a hero by the public for taking out the right people. The idea of the ending being a dream sequence is romantic and ok by me, although the suggestion of a mentally ill loner being praised by the public for killing is scary, especially if one considers how he would have killed Palantine, a public figure in case he wasn't spotted by the bodyguard. The unsettling glance of the mirror serves as an indication that Travis is not well and that the real massacre begins now as he spots his next victim.
In the end, what is Taxi Driver?
To me, it's a film that takes the issues that a male, who is supposed to act in a certain way in order to be perceived as an Alpha-male goes though, in an alienated society that has lost its way. We all have a Travis Bickle inside of us but the film is concerned with portraying the extreme example to keep things interesting. After so many years, Taxi Driver is still relatable as we go through an age of technological prosperity, which indirectly obligates us to socialize through apps such us Facebook, Instagram and various dating apps. We go through an age of massive globalization, with urban setting dominating over the natural and even though we're now the closest with our fellow citizens, it feels like we are yet so much further. Crime, corruption and the so called ""animals"" that come out at night just like Travis says early on, are not only a thing of the past but of the present as well. Depression, isolation, the need for some sort of connection with the other sex, that seems all the more difficult due to outrageous expectations, absurd lifestyles (from both parties) and the turn to pornography are real problems existing today as they did back then. What is Taxi Driver? It is the world seen through the eyes of a depressed loner...a world not at all that dissimilar with our own...with the eyes observing it being not at all that dissimilar to that of a real-life Travis Bickle.
MASTERPIECE: 9.5-10/10"
"FilmLion","9","2","2","24 January 2020"," Beautifully disturbing well crafted film
","Taxi Driver is one of those movies that stay with you. I first saw this movie approximately 15 years ago, then saw it again last night. Some of the storylines in this movie are still daring even by today's standards. Taxi Driver's DNA can be found all over the productions coming out of Hollywood since it's release in 1975 to present day.<br/><br/>Visually, Taxi Driver has that great saturated color that is seen in films from the middle 1970's, but still has a gritty texture. This helps give the whole movie a slightly hypnotic feel that really works as you see the character of Travis Bickle descend into madness. The scenes of Travis driving around at night in his cab really showcase this hypnotic feel while also symbolizing the state of mind of insomniac Travis Bickle. One brief shot near the beginning of the movie simply shows the dark pavement of the road with mottled reflections of color from the lights of the city as the taxi moves about New York City in the night.<br/><br/>The performances of everyone in the cast are excellent in this movie, and definitely hint at the great films that Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel would go on to make later in their careers. And of course the same goes for director Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Something interesting to note for fans of 2019's Joker: if you watch both of these films, it becomes evident that Joker ""borrows"" very heavily from Taxi Driver. Joker director Todd Phillips is obviously heavily influenced by Taxi Driver and used most of the elements of Taxi Driver's storyline in Joker. Robert De Niro also has a role in Joker.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film recommended for viewers who appreciate a movie that reveals itself in layers."

","I doubt the 2-hours is a favorite of NYC's chamber of commerce. The grime and sin fairly drip off the screen-- location filming on the streets being a big, big plus. Poor cabbie Bickle, he's trapped in his own isolation and can't decide whether to break out or celebrate. He'd like to connect with high class Betsy, but he's too self enclosed to realize his porn movies are an insult to her. Then too, he'd like to affirm conventional values by rescuing little Iris from life on the street. But she's too much in love with her pimp, a part of the city filth which he takes care of with an angry gun. Hailed now by the cops and public as a hero, he nevertheless falls back into isolation as passengers come and go from his private cab. Still, he's done his bit to clean up the city. Now he can drive at ease within his self-enclosure. Perhaps the moral is we're each condemned to live inside our own cab. Or is his problem more simply an instance of urban neglect.<br/><br/>Heckuva job by Scorsese and Co. that holds fast audience interest even minus a storyline. Instead, it's an account of one man's struggle inside an alienating environment, and actor DeNiro triumphs in a darn difficult role. In fact, he's in about every scene, so there's plenty of chances to fail.<br/><br/>No need to go on; 1000+ reviews says it all. Nonetheless, I nominate the movie for existentialism's hall of movie fame. Plus next time I take a cab, I'll darn sure be nice to the driver."

","Reading the above comments just makes me reach for the bucket-I may have to reach for the toilet bowl before I finish reading all of them.<br/><br/>This movie is a sad excuse for a B-movie. De Niro's acting has never been so poor, with half-lines and a semi-hashed script which would put a soap opera to shame. The movie is slow, for no apparent reason, the ending is nonsensical and the entire movie is random and without purpose or direction. Now, I hear some of the 'fans' out there shouting ""it's meant to be random, that's what Travis was feeling"" or some other wishfully throughout tripe, but come on, give it up, you've pushed this movie up to #37, you've taken the joke too far, give it up. <br/><br/>I don't know what Scorcese was thinking, maybe he was going through a lonely period in his life feeling a little down, a little alienated, who knows? He must have gone through a similar patch before making Gangs of New York.<br/><br/>I think the only reason why people exaggerate this movie is because they approach it with the formula: De Niro+Scorcese=Ingenious film-making. Hey, it worked for Mean streets, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino. Sorry life, like film-making isn't so simple. You have your good days and your bad days, Taxi Driver was filmed on one of the latter days.<br/><br/>Not worth it! p.s The 2 stars the movie got was for De Niro being in it."

The hero is shown as confused, psychic. But he acts perfectly alright while trying to woo his girl. He becomes confused, when the girl deserts him.

Now, did the girl asked for it? No But our friendly neighborhood taxi driver, decides to do the job.<br/><br/>6. In the end he is killing all people. When he fires people get killed, but even after two fatal shots he is alive. This is not a supposed action flick, but a masterpiece.<br/><br/>7. The press hail him as a hero.

"nazztrader","3","15","30","2 February 2012"," This Emperor has an obvious ""wardrobe malfunction.""
","So many have told us this is a great movie, if not one of the greatest. Why? At the beginning, we are introduced to a man, Travis Bickle. who is behaving in a kind of infantile way. We have no idea why. Is he new to the city? All we really ever learn is that he was in the Marines, honorably discharged, and he thinks New York City is filthy, disgusting, etc. Why? The cinematography actually makes the city look vibrant and dynamic. I was there, at the time, though not quite an adult yet, and never got the sense that it was a filthy, disgusting place, despite my parents' somewhat paranoid attitudes. Granted, I did not travel all over Manhattan, as a taxi driver might, but that just compels the viewer to ask why he is in New York in the first place, let alone driving a taxi there!<br/><br/>When Iris talks about going to a commune in Vermont, he says that it's not the kind of place for him. What is? Yes, we understand he is ""disturbed,"" but we are given no clue as to why, which creates a frustrating quality to this film. We get quite a bit of cozy music (which sometimes goes ""dark"") with the wonderful cinematography, and in general the city appears quite interesting, and not especially dangerous. Why weren't there several scenes of violent crime? Was prostitution only occurring in Manhattan at that time? There is a kind of self-contradictory quality to this film that irritates, and there is not even an attempt to resolve it. A glaring example of this is the long scene with Iris and her pimp; what are we meant to infer from it? It almost seems like Scorsese wants us to think that the ""bad"" New Yorkers aren't really that bad. If so, it contradicts the apparent point of the film. If not, why was it not cut out of the film?<br/><br/>We do see some characters that represent the more ""positive"" side of New York, including the politician, Charles Palantine, and one of his campaign workers, Betsy. Does New York appear to them the way it does to Travis? For the most part, if they are concerned with someone who might do them harm, it is Travis, not the people he regards as ""scum."" This is where the movie could have gone, and it would have been consistent with society, especially the ""white flight"" of that era. We would see that less educated, more ""ethnic,"" ""white"" people had become nearly paranoid with stories about fictions, such as the ""black snipers of Newark,"" for example. We could then see the politician character fanning the flames of such fear, perhaps prompting Travis to do something violent. We could get flashbacks and find out that Travis sees Palantine as a surrogate father. Those kinds of scenes could provide some grounding (social and psychological) to this film. It would be a shocking twist for us to think that Palantine is taking Travis under his wing, only to find out that he is trying to use Travis to further his political ambitions, and at that point, with the cozy music turning ""dark,"" an actual drama might just arise !<br/><br/>I like the idea of the world as seen through the eyes of a troubled man, so I don't object to this approach, but the audience needs some idea of why that person is the way he is (and you can't put in scenes that don't include that character, such as the one with Iris and her pimp). As it stands, this is a confused film. It's like the cinematographer went ahead and made his film while the director was making a contrary one. The soundtrack seems like an attempt to bring the two together, but it doesn't work because we haven't been shown enough contrast between ""good"" and ""bad"" New York, and too much is seen from the perspective of a character who seems seriously disturbed and clearly paranoid, for some unknown reason. And astute viewer might assume that it may be about racial strife, if we consider the recent history, circa the mid 1970s. Perhaps Scorsese just took that for granted, but there are ways of making your ideas known with subtlety, and Scorsese was unwilling or unable to do that here, for whatever reason. I think of an unfinished Old Master portrait when I think of this film, only with the background finished rather than the head !"

","This movie earned rave reviews for one reason only, salacious interest in a twelve year old prostitute. A gratuitous detail, why did she have to be twelve?<br/><br/>Travis Bickel played by de Niro elicits no sympathy or credibility at any point. <br/><br/>Witness his lame dialogue at chatting up the Cybil Shepard character on the phone. Witness de Niro giving her an LP and admitting that he ""knows nothing"" about music. Witness him telling the politician Palladino that he supports him and hopes that he wins the election, and then telling Palladino that he ""knows nothing"" about politics. There was another instance where the lead character confesses that he ""knows nothing"" about some or other issue that had been explored and then summarily cut off by ""knowing nothing"".<br/><br/>Witness the lead character performing the standard and predictable American procedure when a woman states her disinterest in him. The man must grab her by the arm and pull and shove her about. I do not find this (admittedly mild) form of assault to be romantically feasible yet it is standard fare in American movies. Are American women different? Do they change their minds after a little display of childish violence? <br/><br/>We also have the great Scorsese attention deficit, lazy sloppy and stupid showing the protagonist cutting off one of the sleeves of his shirt (why?) and in the next shot the sleeve is back. This isn't a goof, it is unforgivably lazy. At this point you realise that this ""masterpiece"" is a piece of junk.<br/><br/>At some point we arrive at the point of the movie, the unnecessarily young prostitute. More lazy sloppy work follows. Predictable painfully shallow dialogue. ""why are you doing this?"" etc.<br/><br/>Now the pace of the film speeds up because our stupid lazy director is running out of film stock.<br/><br/>Now that the director has fulfilled his child sex fantasies he can give us a gratuitous violence and loving pornographic focus on obviously fake blood and gore and the film quickly wraps with an easy implausible ending.<br/><br/>Our twelve year old whore has gone back to school??? with parents who can't afford to visit New York and she is apparently happy in the rust belt town of Pittsburgh. Poor and happy in Pittsburgh don't make sense. <br/><br/>Her close associates have been violently murdered in front of her and she trots off to school with a bunch of strangers in some godforsaken city?<br/><br/>Our hero has casually killed three people using unlicenced firearms, yet he suffers absolutely zero consequences (another American specialty?) save for hero status in the media and (predictable) interest from the Cybil Shepard person.<br/><br/>A shallow stupid and unoriginal story.

","Travis Bickle is the sort of person you wouldn't even see if you encountered him on the street -- and if you did take note of him, you would make a point to ignore him. He is a non-entity. In his role as a cabbie, you would be aware of him only in the same way you would notice the color of the upholstery or be aware of a strange smell inside the cab. On the rare occasion that Travis might make his presence felt, you would tolerate his existence -- maybe even graciously acknowledge him with a smile or a noncommittal comment. You would only remember Travis if he said or did something particularly rude or offensive or bizarre; and then only as long as you might remember what you had for lunch or what your horoscope said.<br/><br/>There is no reason to remember, or to feel bad about not remembering, a Travis Bickle because he has no real effect on your life. He does a job, he fills a space; just like millions of other anonymous everyday workers. But the sad thing about Travis is that he has no real effect on anyone. Most people have a life -- family, friends, interests, a purpose beyond being part of the machinery. Travis only has a job. You would not notice Travis, but Travis might notice you. And judge you: He might decide that you are part of what makes life worth tolerating, but more likely he might see you as part of what makes the world an unbearable hell. <br/><br/>It is the nature of film that when it casts an eye toward the ""little guy,"" the attempt is to show that the ordinary man has something extraordinary about him that society is missing -- even if that is just an everyday niceness. This being a Martin Scorsese film, written by Paul Schrader, filmmakers with a near-suicidal view of mankind, the point of TAXI DRIVER is just the opposite. If Travis Bickle is a remarkable person in any sense, it is in a negative way. Travis is not a good man; he is petty and mean-spirited and bigoted and self-absorbed and judgmental. He views the world with contempt; he has to, he has to have more hate for the world than he has for himself. <br/><br/>TAXI DRIVER is the story of a man living the proverbial life of quite desperation. In self-imposed isolation, Travis is mentally unstable, and probably was long before the film starts. The film supposedly is loosely based on THE SEARCHERS, but it has much more in common with PSYCHO. Travis, like Norman Bates hides his insanity behind a facade of banality and nurses it with his loneliness. Insignificant men with a significant amount of pent up anger. The main difference -- and it is a telling difference -- is that we don't see Norman's rage until the end, it takes us by surprise; while we never doubt that Travis has inner demons. What Travis does is a foregone conclusion. <br/><br/>Paul Schrader's dark, oppressive script pointedly refers to Travis as a walking contradiction, often at the cost of the story's credibility. He's not particularly bright and at times almost shockingly slow, but his journal entries are surprisingly articulate. He declares a woman to be ""an angel,"" but is dismayed that she is offended by being taken to a porno film. He claims to have an honorable discharge from the marines, yet he seems to have been born yesterday, not even knowing the meaning of a common phrase like ""moonlighting."" Schrader's superficial screenplay is long on obscenities and racial slurs, but short on simple logic. <br/><br/>The shortcomings of the script are offset to a great degree by solid performances and Scorsese's stylish direction. As Travis, Robert DeNiro is in virtually every scene and even though the screenplay falters at various times, DeNiro holds the film together with a consistency of tone and insight. Forgoing his usual bombastic method posturing (during most of the film), DeNiro plays Travis with a compassion that makes this otherwise horrid little man pitiable, if not sympathetic. He makes us care for Travis, even though the story offers us no real reason to. Jodie Foster, playing the child prostitute to whom Travis hopes to play savior, still has the youthful freshness and wise innocence that made her a treasure as a child actress. (Though I have trouble respecting Scorsese for casting a 13-year-old child, even one as mature and worldly as Foster, in a part that is so squalid and degrading.) <br/><br/>Scorsese sees in Travis' New York City a teeming cesspool, but with cinematographer Michael Chapman, he makes it the most photogenic cesspool imaginable. He doesn't romanticize New York, but he does romanticize Travis' seething hatred of the city. However, he does wisely counterpoint Travis grubby view of the world with a sense of a real world, where friends and coworkers joke and talk and, well, exist. Unlike RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, Scorsese films where psychotic characters exist in closed worlds where their lunatic behavior seems the norm, TAXI DRIVER underscores Travis' outsider status by giving us a realistic world that he is isolated from. As such, TAXI DRIVER has an honesty that his other violent epics lack.<br/><br/>But Scorsese provides us with at least two scenes that ring utterly false. His own gratuitous cameo as a passenger graphically boasting of his plans to murder his wife seems to be Scorsese's way of showing that there are people who are even crazier than Travis. Why? To suggest that Travis is justified in his paranoia? Also the final climatic bloodbath provided only a cheap shock at the time and now seems like a tiresome cliché of special effects gore. Such over the top mayhem doesn't underscore the brutality of the violence, it trivializes the rest of the film. TAXI DRIVER, like DeNiro's performances, is best in its still moments of quiet desperation.<br/><br/>The irony of the violence is that it eventually makes Travis famous, though it could have just as easily have made him infamous. The bullets that kill the pimp could have killed the politician. In Travis' mind they are pretty much the same. Unfortunately, I don't think some people get that. Travis, in the end, is not a hero, he is a murder. He is not purged of his demons; they are just temporarily placated. The famed ""you talking' to me?"" scene has reached iconic status, symbolic of tough-guy cool -- not unlike Dirty Harry's ""Make my day."" But both Travis and Harry are dangerous icons; filmgoers delude themselves into accepting their insane displays of violence because the right make-believe characters get killed. They are protected by the fantasy of film; in the real world they would eventually be revealed to be the monsters. To his credit, Scorsese at least suggests that in the end Travis Bickle is still insane, and armed and dangerous. Even so, the ending is uncomfortably ambiguous: I don't think that Scorsese is as afraid of Travis' insanity as he is in awe of it."

"yurikon","10","6","10","5 March 2006"," Taxi Driver interprets Shakespeare
","THE SICILIAN CONNECTION Taxi Driver and The Winter's Tale What follows comes from work in progress on how Scorsese's movie may cast light on Shakespeare's play.<br/><br/>At the end of Pasolini's film of dipus Rex the blind king walks out of his world into the streets of modern Bologna. If Leontes, King of the Sicilians,went missing, where would he reappear? The hero of Taxi Driver turns up in modern New York of 1976, as if out of nowhere, or maybe one of his own bad daydreams. He's looking for a job to suit an insomniac. Like the Great Gatsby, Travis Bickle seems to be be born of his vision of himself, and this casts doubt on the substance of both self and vision.<br/><br/>He gets a job driving a yellow cab. Then he falls for Betsy, a girl with class Then he goes out of his way to foul up by taking her to a blue movie. There, his attention is soon distracted from the real woman at his side . Betsy checks out in disgust. Later he calls her on the phone, but you can't tell whether there's really anyone at the other end. So his thoughts turn to 'saving' Iris, a twelve-year-old hooker who has also come out of nowhere, into his cab. Taxi Driver is set firmly in the eponymous mean streets of an earlier Scorsese movie, and before that, of The Godfather, the daddy of them all. Travis now has to kill some bad people, one of them Iris= trick, a Mafioso. Travis has already killed her pimp Matthew, or Sport - almost twice. In the street outside the tenement where she trades he shoots Sport in the belly before going inside to continue his righteous massacre. The pimp reappears in the hallway, alive and armed, and has to be gunned down again, as if to get it right. But Iris is saved, Betsy forgives Travis now that he=s a hero, and Travis survives. Or does he? Do they? Does any of it happen at all? Can such questions be asked of a work of fiction? In Taxi Driver the narrative viewpoint seems clear. The film opens and closes on Travis' brooding eyes. Intermittently he gives a running commentary in voice-over, which turns out to be the journal he keeps. Sometimes the screen shows things that appear to happen independently, without his knowledge. So these events seem to be 'real'. But they decrease in credibility. Travis sits in his taxi outside a building inside which a tender scene takes place between Iris and her pimp. And now Sport says: Come to me, baby, and he puts a record on the phonograph. He tells her: I'd like every man in the world to know what it is to be loved by you. Inadvertent humour can't get much bleaker. But whose joke is this? Travis buys a suitcaseful of artillery. He practises quick draws in the mirror. Sometimes he packs two guns, but he (as distinct from his reflection) is right-handed. Especially with his star weapon, a forty four magnum. In due course he uses it to shoot off some of the fingers of Iris' 'timekeeper'. Strangely, this has earlier and out of his hearing been described as a typical Mob punishment. Then, in reverse shot, we see the gun in Travis' left hand. He goes on to finish killing the pimp, the mobster and the timekeeper. And then himself - a death he has clearly intended or expected - except that now he=s all out of bullets. So he pretends. He points a finger at his own temple. It lets fall a single drop of blood. He gives a death=s head grin. His thumb works an invisible hammer. Bang, I'm dead.<br/><br/>Afterwards he gets police commendations, glowing press reports and grateful notes in what looks like his own handwriting. He loses the scar where a bullet creased him in the neck He grows back his hair, which he'd shaved to a Mohican crest. Finally exalted to a realm above human love and desire, Travis can patronise Betsy, who wistfully seeks him out, but can't get to him now. He's gone through the looking glass. Taxi Driver is perhaps the most chilling representation of psychic death ever to reach a universal audience. The question is: what sort of representation? In a Steinberg cartoon the subject, pencil in hand,is shown completing the picture which is himself. That picture is another of those 'impossible' objects which is possible because there it is. The work of art has become its own creator.<br/><br/>It's been said that a work of art goes about the world independently of its author's power to intend about it. In Taxi Driver it's as if the film itself has decided to dispense with the conventional markers that distinguish between what's 'really' happening and what's inside the hero's mind.<br/><br/>Such a work enacts the idea that all events, including events 'in the real world' are events in the consciousness; may only be events in the consciousness. We create the world, as they say, from moment to moment as we go along. If our dreams are allegories of the way we experience this world, then by extension our waking perception may be the same; except that it has to adjust itself - from moment to moment as we go along.<br/><br/>The movie screen, arena of the 'dream factory', is the obvious place to see this happening. So is the theatre. Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale is like a still, a tableau which suddenly comes to life out of a sort of Arcadian trance as in the Book of Genesis; and as in Genesis, with the touch of the serpent's tooth. It shows a man in torment because he's recreated the world as the hell in his own mind. A hell which he has to exorcise in blood. To understand Shakespeare's great work you could do worse than read it through the eyes of Taxi Driver."

","What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such."

","""Taxi Driver"" is in a way one of the most timeless movies ever, inspired by ""The Searchers"" directed by John Ford.

It is perhaps only ""Taxi Driver"" that has convinced me that Martin Scorsese is a great director and that Robert De Niro has a huge capacity as an actor. I think that the other things that I have seen by this couple is not even close to ""Taxi Driver"".<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese´s masterpiece has turned to be one of the most referenced modern movies ever. ""Taxi Driver"" is not pathetic, but still it gives the viewer such strong emotions from start to end, simply because of the strong job by Scorsese (and his team) that he surely won't surpass.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 of 10."

","According to another reviewer on this site, JosefSerf: '""Taxi Driver"" is about loneliness and loneliness is characterized by an almost crushing boredom and emptiness and Travis Bickle's character reflects that. His life is dull and boring, hardly anything happens to him and that is what ""Taxi Driver"" shows - Bickle's pathetic life.'<br/><br/>And that's what you get, a crushingly boring movie about a deranged man.

","Unless I'm hopelessly not getting it, the plot suggests that do-it-yourself-justice, including death-penalty, is very cool and stylish.<br/><br/>
The ""hero"" (De Niro) is made as a figure to identify with [the viewer is put into the hero's point-of-view most of the time, and, more important, into the hero's mood all the time - the monotonous melancholic soundtrack (basically, solo-saxophone) reflects the hero's extreme loneliness, and loneliness is a feeling known to everybody], and the hero's fascist ideology (some people are 'dirt') is not questioned anywhere. The film glorifies violence and fascist ideology, and that's about most disgusting message I can think of, and not very original either.<br/><br/>Every James-Bond does the same, I admit, but the difference is, that in case of James Bond, noone expects art, makers and viewers know, that a new James-Bond is  going to be the same old entertainment via special effects, completely lacking a story apart from standard testosterone-phantasy. Taxi-driver is like James Bond minus the special effects. If the message actually should have been ""the hero is an asshole"", then the film is inane.

His portrayal and character are completely fascinating from start to finish. He creates a character that somehow transcends out of the screen and glues the audience into believing, sympathizing, and experiencing with his character. The same can be said for Scorsese. Up until this point I always had Raging Bull as his finest, but something about his work here is completely mesmerizing. Taxi Driver comes together as an incredible piece of filmmaking, with completely intriguing dialogue, and story-wise it is flawless (although technically wise I would say Scorsese was still getting the hang of it). <br/><br/>BRAVO to Taxi Driver, and I cannot believe I waited this long to see it."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","3","4","12 August 2007"," ""Someday a real rain will come"" (spoilers)
","It's always a bit worrying when someone tells you that they deeply identify with Travis Bickle. What, so you enjoy taking women to porno films, have a gun fetish and enjoy befriending 12-year-old prostitutes? If you say so, mate.<br/><br/>But seriously, although it's a bit disturbing when people tell you they agree wholeheartedly with Travis Bickle's outlook on life (""someday a real rain will come""), I'm sure most people can relate to him to a certain extent. The loneliness is certainly something that most people have felt at some time. And really, even though you're surrounded by millions of people, large cities can be the loneliest places on the planet. Everywhere you go you see people making connections while you can only peer at them from the outside.<br/><br/>This is certainly the case for Travis. He's a perpetual outsider. He just doesn't fit in anywhere. Just take the scenes with his fellow cabbies. Here are his work colleagues, people who go through the same crap as him, and yet he has nothing to say to them. They can't understand him and vice versa. But despite this he does try and reach out. He tries to tell one of his colleagues the crazy thoughts that are going through his head. But just as you feel he's going to reveal himself, he has to swallow some of the stupidest advice that's ever been put forward. A chance to make a connection has been lost. And yet, even though this cabbie spouts random nonsense, one thing he says has a ring of truth. He tells Travis he should get laid.<br/><br/>And that's what Travis really needs. He desperately needs a shag. He needs a proper release. But while Travis does try and meet someone, he goes about it in the wrong way. In one excruciating scene he tries to pick up a woman at a porno theatre. Yeah, that's going to work. A woman who's working in a porno theatre is really going to want to date one of the jerk-offs she has to serve.<br/><br/>And then of course there's the scene where he takes Betsy to see a movie. Fair play to Travis, though, he does ask this attractive woman out on a date and does a decent enough job of holding a conversation with her (although he's rather intense and insults one of her work colleagues), but just when things may be going right, when he may have a chance to ease his crippling loneliness, he decides to take her to see something from his favourite genre  porn. Even though Travis is desperately trying to reach out to outside world he's continually reinforcing his loneliness. And when Betsy's response to this charming outing is overwhelmingly negative, and when she no longer wants to speak to him, he blames the world for his sorry situation. He's completely unable to look within himself. The problem, apparently, is with everyone else, not him.<br/><br/>So in light of this failed attempt to get laid, Travis reverts to a form of masturbation. I mean, all the guns he buys and all the macho posturing before the mirror is pure onanism. He's striking out against his impotence and the world that mocks him for it. And all the time when he sees sex or couples in love on TV he points his gun at them. He wants to destroy these people who have the audacity to pursue some sort of happiness.<br/><br/>And when you think about it, Travis' whole idiotic attempt to kill Senator Palantine is the action of a jilted lover. Here's a man that Betsy adores so therefore Travis is going to blow his brains out. But of course Travis can't even do this. Again he's impotent.<br/><br/>So with this act of vengeance a failure, the next best thing for Travis is to 'rescue' Iris, the 12-year-old prostitute played by Jodie Foster. I guess it's a strange kind of delusion that affects the lonely man, but they often seem to think that they're on some sort of righteous mission; that their pain and suffering is there to serve a greater good and that they'll be worshipped when they're finally understood.<br/><br/>And so finally Travis gets to strike out against this diseased society. He finally gets a chance to get his gun off. And he does it in the most vile, sickening way  blowing fingers off and blowing people's brains out. This is the girl's knight in shining armour. This is her hero  a man sporting a Mohawk and dripping with blood.<br/><br/>And so this begs the question as to whether the epilogue is some sort of pre-death fantasy on the part of Travis or whether it's a satirical swipe at the way we sometimes make heroes out of monsters. I mean, we get to hear a letter from Iris' parents where Travis is lauded as a hero. We get to see Travis with his work colleagues  now he's one of the gang. And then finally we get to see Betsy. You get the feeling that maybe she wants to apologise to Travis and give their fledgling relationship another try. But instead Travis drives off. Surely this is precisely what Travis would want to happen. He'd want to become the righteous hero, he'd want to gain acceptance from those around him and he'd want a chance to stick it to that filthy whore who didn't understand him. Surely in reality his bloodbath would be quickly forgotten. And surely, if he survived, he'd end up in jail.<br/><br/>But that ambiguity is one of the many things that makes Taxi Driver such an outstanding film. You're presented with one of the most unflinching depictions of loneliness and how you respond to it is up to you. Hero or villain, saint or sinner  the choice is yours."

These are the hours when the city is at its worse. Bickle takes it upon himself to do something about the scum-ridden city. De Niro brings the brilliant script of Paul Schader to life, guided by the genius of Scorsese's camera and the fantastic supporting cast comprised of Cybill Shepard, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel and a young Jodie Foster.

"JoeytheBrit","Null","4","6","4 September 2005"," On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody...
","Taxi Driver is one of the first earnest studies of urban alienation that, in a very real sense, predicted many of the inevitable consequences such a condition spawns, and from which America (and Britain) has suffered over the past two decades. It proved to be a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy when, less than five years after it was filmed, a loner shot the US president to impress an actress who had appeared in this film. The implications of this are a little frightening when you think about it <br/><br/>Robert De Niro is scarily convincing as Travis Bickle, a nondescript Vietnam vet who observes the dissolution on the streets of New York from the isolation of his cab. Each night he drives the streets, witnessing a tide of depravity that spills into the back of his cab, and each morning, after his shift, he has to wipe from the back seat the results of those intrusions. That's a bad enough experience for any man, but Travis is a loner who longs for a normal life and relationships but is too inarticulate and confused to be able to obtain them. He ruins his chance with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), campaign worker for a senator seeking election, by taking her to a porn film on their first date, and is genuinely confused when she takes exception to such behaviour. As Bickle tries to win her back on a public phone, his face hidden from the viewer, the camera pans away from him to focus on a corridor leading to the street as if embarrassed for him, and from then on, as his descent into madness gathers pace, Travis seems to edge further toward the edge of the screen in almost every shot.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann's score superbly captures both the sleazy side of the New York streets and the sense of foreboding that permeates the entire film. Scorsese guides us through Bickle's increasingly disturbed state of mind without resorting to sensationalism or cheap manipulation of the audience, and Paul Schrader's intelligent script creates a completely believable character in Bickle as an unremarkable everyman who shares our standards of what's right and wrong but with a skewed perspective that has turned him into a ticking time-bomb. Only the speed with which Bickle and Iris develop a relationship and the contentious ending, for which too many people try to find a hidden meaning, weakens the film overall. That ending just doesn't sit right with the rest of the film  and Scorsese himself has discounted theories that it may be a dream sequence  but that shouldn't dissuade anyone with an interest in intelligent, thought-provoking films to catch this one at least once."

Great stories wrecked by Scorsese; like Casino, and awful movies made worse by Scorsese; like Aviator. So where does Taxi Driver fall? Right along side with Casino, an intriguing story and characters ruined by an incompetent Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>The story revolves around a man (Robert DeNiro) who takes a job as a taxi driver, and wants to get his life organized, finally does so when he meets a teen prostitute (Jodie Foster), and wants to help her regain her life.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro's performance and character he plays is definitely inspirational, along with his line ""You talking to me?"", which this movie is credited for starting.<br/><br/>But even great stories with great actors can still fail miserably due to lousy presentation cause of a flimsy director, namely Martin Scorsese. He ruined Taxi Driver by making it dull, lame and impotent, as he did with his other films. Out of all the directors, like John Carpenter and George Lucas, they normally ruin masterpieces the second time around with remakes, special editions, and prequels/sequels. Scorsese wrecks masterpieces the first time around.<br/><br/>The story alone is enough to warrant the movie a 7/10, but the awful directing renders Taxi Driver to 2.5/10. If directed by anyone except Martin Scorsese, then Taxi Driver had a better chance of winning best picture. But with Scorsese, Taxi Driver is thankful that the Razzies didn't appear until the early 1980's.<br/><br/>But the character study and story are too much to ignore, and demands a remake without a movie wrecker like Martin Scorsese."

","This story of a Vietnam vet, Travis Bickle, who becomes increasingly isolated and alienated until he explodes in violence is a fine piece of film-making. When it was over I asked myself if it was worth watching and did not arrive at a definitive ""Yes.""<br/><br/>Travis works some of the sleaziest streets of New Your City. He drives his taxi against a backdrop of prostitutes, drug dealers, pimps, porno houses, and various lowlifes. He seems repulsed by what he sees, but in other ways obsessed by it. <br/><br/>He tries to make contact with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who is working on a presidential campaign. She initially shows some interest, but on one of their first times together Travis takes her to a porn movie and she is so disgusted she walks out on the movie as well as on Travis. This scene says a lot about Travis' social ineptitude, but it puzzles the viewer as well--if Travis is so turned off by the sordidness he sees, why participate in it? Before going into the movie he tells Betsy that she will like it and that indicates he is not a stranger to such movies; has he been going to them alone? This plays into the repulsion/obsession theme. <br/><br/>If the sordidness is what is driving Travis over the edge, why is his first target of violence the presidential candidate? Is it a way at striking back at Betsy's rejection, or just the manifestation of a confused mind? When Travis kills all of the lowlifes at the end, he is basically exonerated and applauded. If he had been successful in executing his first target, the movie would have had an entirely different outcome and audience reaction. In judging Travis it should be kept in mind that he could just as well have been an assassin as an avenger.<br/><br/>The acting is terrific. There are some iconic scenes like the taxi emerging from a cloud of steam and DeNiro's ""You lookin' at me,"" scene. Jodie Foster turns in a good performance as a twelve-year-old prostitute and Harvey Keitel is perfect as a hopped up pimp. Interestingly, one of the scariest scenes has Scorsese himself playing a contentious fare in Travis' cab, with murder on his mind.<br/><br/>The original score by Bernard Herrmann alternates between being evocative of the sad and depressing street scenes and being overly intrusive.<br/><br/>I appreciated this as an accomplished work of art, but having been dragged through the hell presented, I was looking for some additional reward or meaning. The storyline of an alienated loner erupting in violence is not exactly breaking news. The one scene that was perhaps the most meaningful to me was between Bickle and his fellow driver ""Wizard"" (Peter Boyle). In his inarticulate way Bickle tries to tell Wizard that he is having some real problems and feels like he is going to explode. Wizard basically responds with the ""Hey, everything is going to be OK,"" line. Maybe the message is that we should pay closer attention to what people are saying. But it is hard to see what is going to stop Bickle's slide toward the abyss. <br/><br/>I would like to have come away with a better understanding of Travis Bickle and his motivations. We know almost nothing of his life before we meet him, except for his tour in Vietnam. Did that contribute to his actions? But maybe the point is that there is no way to truly understand such a man."

"donuthaters12","10","5","9","24 July 2013"," A Dark Journey Through New York
","Martin Scorsese is a director where I'm unsure whether I would love the picture or not as there are some from his work that I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I would. So I came into this thinking maybe it will be decent but nothing more. The film is most definitely excellent and so far my favorite film from him.<br/><br/>The plot of Taxi Driver is a man, Travis Bickle, who decides to become a taxi driver and in this profession he sees the filth and waste of the city and this frustrates him deeply. Along the story, he encounters a beauty that stands out from the crowd and a young prostitute he, by chance, sees once in a while and becomes involved with. What held my interest the most is Travis' perspective of the world around him. Schrader has written a fantastic screenplay that keeps itself grounded and personal as we follow this man alone and we only see his understanding of the world, not anybody else's. The story does focus on areas like his romance with Betsy, and his relationship with Iris but it all adds to the point of his frustration. It's plot kept me hook throughout the whole ride and requires a bit of patience as the screenplay is more like the journey of a dark cab ride rather than the destination.<br/><br/>This film is herald by many as his greatest film, I can surely say that this film is his best I have seen so far as I have not seen all that he has done. This film felt like a journey of not just Travis but New York as Scorsese wants us to be the passengers of Travis' journey. It clearly shows that Scorsese loves New York and knows how to capture it's beauty and it's filth. The film feels very personal to Scorsese, which is the reason of this film being so grounded as at some level, Travis is Scorsese in a way. There are many people who watch films and feel detached with the protagonist's intentions but I'm the type that follows them and accepts them regardless of their intentions and values. Yes, there are people out there who may watch this film and think Bickle is a little insane but I think he's the only man in the city who has a clear mind.<br/><br/>Michael Chapman may be the cinematographer in this film but I felt that the film's image was more tamed by Scorsese rather than Chapman. Scorsese to me, feels like Terrence Malick when it comes to the cinematography as both seem to have a clear idea of what they want and how it should look, which is the reason why their films at times can be a little bit indulgent, not in a bad way. Taxi Driver captures a different side of New York that nobody ever wants to see. Even if the streets are lit by brightly colored neon, the place is still looks like a garbage landfill, and this is because Scorsese knows the area so well that it looks very convincing. I would still give props for Chapman as I think he still had a major contribution in some way.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann is a legend. The man is responsible for many film scores that have become iconic and adored by many. Taxi Driver's score has this jazzy smooth quality to it that fits very well with the time period and the setting that the film has taken place. The saxophone gives this smooth sound but at the same time feels very sleazy, which fits with Travis' perspective of his surroundings. There are at times where it gets dark and a little crazy, especially when the score is building up and then crashes. Herrmann's work here may not be as iconic as his work on Psycho or Vertigo but great enough that other composers have taken inspiration from him, especially if the film's setting is in New York.<br/><br/>The film is driven by DeNiro's performance, which I can definitely consider as one of his best. This is definitely different from his previous work in The Godfather Part II, which is more out there. In Taxi Driver, he plays it simply without any overacting, which is the reason why the whole film feels very smooth. I liked seeing De Niro playing roles like this where he isn't a gangster or a mobster but rather a regular guy. The two women in this film were casted excellently as they were very appropriate for their roles. Cybill Shepherd in this film is beautiful, she is radiant and elegant, and works well with De Niro. I was a little skeptical with Jodie Foster playing as a young prostitute as I have only seen her in strong roles like Silence of the Lambs and Inside Man but she really pulled it off here. Younger actors sometimes tend to overact but Foster kept it easy and light. Harvey Keitel was great but a little bit underused, same goes to Albert Brooks. The acting in this film is spectacular and will definitely be adored by those who like their film with easy-going acting.<br/><br/>It contains simple acting gritty photography and excellent direction from Scorsese; making the screenplay come to life. The film overall is fantastic, just seeing New York in this light makes this definitely worth a watch."

He is one of a kind. I love the way he tells the story through the lens. He is the best storyteller with the camera. I love breaking down this film.

He was the first director to make me think about what's happening behind the camera than what's happening in front of it. Genius Director<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is amazing in this film. His portrayal as a lonely human being is frightening. You love watching him on screen but at the same time, you want to look away but you can't. You want to know what's going to happen to this very disturbed character but you're afraid to see where this character is going to take you.

"johnXny","10","5","9","22 February 2011"," At a Glance: Taxi Driver
","Giving this movie more than just a quick look should be named a mistake already. Through all of things it covers such as the Political Campaign to Sport and his girls, are only a small thought in the true Character study of Travis (De Niro). Its not really a day in the life of someone who's crazy, but a life of hardship and loneliness that has been brought to this very point the viewer is witnessing. If you watch the movie for more than ten minutes or review and try to get a better understanding you'll notice different details about what the movie is actually trying to display. <br/><br/>** SPOILERS ** <br/><br/>The movie starts off in New York City where we first see Travis applying to be a night shift cab driver. He claims to not be able to sleep at night and drives around. Through the movie we evaluate how lonesome and anti-social he is by how many times he fails to befriend or make conversations with others. Through messing up a relationship with a woman working at campaign office, and other faults such as a murderous man in his cab, a teen aged prostitute, and the ""Scum"" observed on the streets, Travis slides deeper into a disturbed mental state which causes him to become violent and stand up against what he's finds wrong through the film. He attempts to assassinate the presidential candidate through the movie that Betsy supports because like Sport (Harvey Keitel) to Iris (Jodie Foster), he is a man holding her back from being set free or being with him.<br/><br/>**THE ENDING**<br/><br/>If you've seen the movie you would be aware of the ending that almost donned the film an X rating.<br/><br/>Iris is declared free and is sent back home to her family. (this is the only part of the ending we can actually call true)<br/><br/>Ending 1: The Viewers misunderstood, but emotionally well ending.<br/><br/>After the massacre Travis spends time healing in the hospital and is eventually released and named a Hero by the press. Iris's family give him thanks for rescuing her and being such a good person. Life returns to normal and he continues to drive his taxi, he picks up Betsy and a fare. Through confidence they speak and she is impressed by his actions, she asks how much and but he doesn't take her money. Travis is finally known and loved for protecting the girl and taking wrong doers off the streets. Accomplished. Driving off he views himself in the mirror, and a piercing noise dissuades his attention and his mirror gets moved trying to view something in the street. This ending could be called true by the possibility of a sequel in the works.<br/><br/>Ending 2: The Satisfying and perfect character study ending.<br/><br/>Through the film we watch Travis go from being a sort of normal guy just trying to get by, from the end he slips up and finds himself working between assassin and vigilante. We watch him kill the people holding Iris from living what would be a normal life, and see him being wounded in the process. As the police come in Travis his fingers to his head like a gun and you see when his head tilts back his eyes roll back. In film thats dignified as a characters death. Directly after the scene, we notice Travis's life has improved and he has been renown as a hero by the press, thanked by Iris's family, a good guy, and also confident to the woman he's been trying to get the entire movie. Travis finally has the satisfaction he's been looking for the whole time, but doesn't it seem like its happening rapidly together? In the film you have watched Travis's persona changing along with the character analysis. Knowing his goals the entire time you finally get to see them flourish, after the tone of the film changes entirely. To the Point where Travis tilts his head back, to where he adjusts his mirrors, your seeing his fantasy and fulfillment he was always wishing for. To be seen and noticed, as a hero or maybe even less. Travis is finding satisfaction in what isn't actually true, as his last dying thoughts. He doesn't notice something in the rear view mirror with a sharp noise, he vanishes from his sight because he isn't truly there. His life has ended and his fantasy has finished along with the film. <br/><br/>As the movie is a character study for insanity this ending would be perfect because you see him from his good descent to a vigilante to his last dying thoughts of love and being noticed he dreamed of. It makes the movie beautiful and worth all of the hype just to see, his character as detailed and deformed as it is. I can watch it over and over and notice something else every time. <br/><br/>The ending is haunting every time, no matter how you think about it because it leaves you with a 'what just happened'? If it means a sequel to find out what happened with fiction or reality, life or death for Travis. I Think i would rather keep the mystery"
"mercuryadonis","10","5","9","12 January 2002"," Travis Bickle is the definitive Gotham City avenger...
","If only bad-ass cartoon characters like Batman and Spawn could muster  one-tenth of the psychotic rage Travis Bickle possesses. Bickle's cape is the Vietnam Marine jacket that he wears throughout the film.  The way ""Bickle"" is stenciled  on the back it might as well be a giant ""S"" or the insipid Bat logo that various actors have exhibited though a series of pointless films.  The whole film unspools like a dream that a Vietnam grunt could be envisioning while dying in a rice paddy on the other side of the world. (Oh, wait, that was Jacob's Ladder...) Travis is a gratingly rascist  and moralistic character and the black pimps and drag queens he regards with such contempt through his cab window could be stand-ins for the Vietcongs he couldn't quite vanquish when he had the chance.  His plan to assassinate the Presidential candidate is undertaken with the same ritualistic precision of a military mission.  For Bickle the war has not ended and he has simply transposed the conflict onto the streets of New York. His bipolar view of the world--people are either angels like Betsy or ""scum sucking scum"" like Sport--is eerily prophetic of America's current perception of world events. (You're either with us or you're with the terrorists)  When Travis wishes for  ""a real rain that'll wash the scum off the streets"" he sounds chillingly like John Ashcroft or, Dubya, or even Guiliani (who almost accomplished what Travis couldn't)  It's sobering to think that an outlook as disturbed and childishly naive as Travis' could morph into the mainstream point of view.  <br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILER) Current politics aside, the little coda at the end of the film, when Travis is back at his job, a reluctant hero among his fellow cabbies--albiet with a lingering soreness in his neck --has always mystified me.   Could it be that that last ride with Betsy, whom Travis merely glimpses at through the mirror, is in fact his out of body release into death as he sits amidst the bloodbath back in the hotel room? I think Scorsese strongly implies this when De Niro takes one last look at himself in the overhead mirror and suddenly his face disappears from view.  Notice the musical sting right when that happens.  It's utterly chilling; a depiction of death more unnerving than anything I've ever seen in another film.  (Or at least on par with the flash of white leader when a man shoots himself in Mean Streets.)  The film is timeless and it reflects meaningfully, like a looking glass, on each era we pass through."

And yet it is so boring that I was constantly looking at my watch, hoping it was close to being over.<br/><br/>I gave three stars: one because it is the minimum, one for DeNiro's performance, and one for Foster's performance.<br/><br/>Despite TD's hype, I cannot recommend it."

You don't start playing with guns and shooting people, just because you see crime on the streets... Or perhaps you do, and slowly evolve into doing this, but then I would have liked to see him evolve emotionally. Instead we see a guy, uncapable of expressing his emotions and we are puzzled by what really goes on in his head.<br/><br/>Furthermore it was unclear to me what message the movies was trying to convey... It was probably about how rotten society is and about how society can drive a man crazy, but was he a hero, a victim, or just part of this crazy society?

It's depressing with an annoying misplaced soundtrack. And peoples clothes and haircuts makes it impossible to take it seriously. If you expect this movie to be a vengeance movie, you will be disappointed. Nothing happens for the first hour and a half.

","A film like 'Taxi Driver' makes me wonder whether, perhaps, it's just my fault, not being able to appreciate ""great"" cinema. 'Taxi Driver' is, unarguably, one of the most highly regarded works ever committed to celluloid, and many claim that the chance to essay the character of Travis Bickle, the tormented protagonist of the tale, is every actor's 'wet dream'.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle, unquestionably, is unforgettably portrayed by a De Niro at the very top of his form. Every move is measured, nuanced, and honed to perfection. As a performance, it is a tour de force. No questions about that.<br/><br/>But what about the film itself? I read both the reviews, of this film, by the highly regarded and universally respected Roger Ebert, who, clearly, is overawed by it, as he is by Scorcese himself. Myself, I came out of the experience with a ""Was THAT it?"" feeling. Internet reviews of the film had raised my expectations so high that, at the end of it all, I felt as if someone had hit me with a wet sock.<br/><br/>Ebert, in one of his reviews, meditates considerably on the ending of the film, which, he wonders, might be a dream, and partook more of the character of ""music"" than of ""drama"". To me, it seemed nothing of the kind. To me, the film appeared to be a straightforward story of a vigilante, who - to avoid straying into spoiler territory - achieves something honourable, and is lauded for it. I found nothing dreamlike about it, and, with all due respect, felt that the film ended on a note which was disappointingly flat.<br/><br/>I do not intend to expound on the story of the film, which is straightforward, and would be well known to net surfers, having been discussed ad nauseam an interminable number of times. The Wikipedia introduction to the plot of the film, though, I felt was misleading. It claims the film to be the story of Bickle's
""descent into insanity"". To me, it seems nothing of the kind. Bickle appears just as sane, at the close of the story, as he was at its start.<br/><br/>Apart from De Niro's performance, which invited the four stars I have, somewhat hesitatingly, awarded this film, I found nothing really to right home about. Sure, Jodie Foster, at twelve and a half, is cute as a button, but she really has nothing much to do. And I also feel that the wonderful Harvey Keitel, who stays on screen for exactly two scenes, is sadly wasted.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointment.<br/><br/>Or is it, perhaps, that I just do not appreciate great cinema? Maybe. Who knows?"

Travis is one who is at odds with society, fed up with pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and all the other scum of the earth, he slowly works himself in his sleep deprived and drugged state to become a one man army ready to kill anyone he believes to be part of the problem.<br/><br/>His interactions with other cabbies, Betsy (Shepherd) a Presidential Candidate campaign worker, Iris a teenage prostitute (Foster), and her Pimp ""Sport"" (Keitel) fuels his destructive mission to rid New York City of its problems. His attempt at normalcy with Betsy, by taking her on date to a movie that disagrees with her sensibilities ends in disaster, mostly due to Travis' supposed naivety about what is considered appropriate and tasteful entertainment.<br/><br/>While plying his nightly trade as a NYC cabbie, he has some unusual encounters, including a fare from a fairly psychotically jealous man showing Travis the place where the man's wife is cheating on him, and then a short encounter with Iris who gets in his cab, and then forced out by Sport, who throws Travis a dirty crumpled up twenty dollar note for the trouble, Travis then makes it his mission to rescue Iris from her situation while also making a menace of himself to the visiting Presidential candidate.<br/><br/>This film is still relevant in these times, as social media, and other such technological & society advancements have brought about a new degradation of values, with many wanting their fifteen minutes of fame by any means necessary, which now brings with it many who sell their souls to attain notoriety.<br/><br/>I love De Niro's performance as Travis, its one that has many facets to it, in it is a man who is angry, naive, sleep deprived, lonely, a sociopath, and a killer.<br/><br/>A scene in the Presidential campaign office where he is rebuffed by Betsy due to the terrible date experience, and ushered, and menaced by the opportunistic & snotty campaign co-worker Tom (Brooks), shows the range of De Niro's performance as he goes from apologetic, and sheepish to angry, and ready to fight.

"Desertman84","10","4","7","25 February 2012"," Truly A Must-See Classic
","Taxi Driver is a 1976 American psychological thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader. The film is set in New York City, soon after the Vietnam War. The film stars Robert De Niro and features Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.<br/><br/>In Martin Scorsese's classic 1970s drama, insomniac ex-Marine Travis Bickle works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout decaying mid- '70s New York City, wishing for a ""real rain"" to wash the ""scum"" off the neon-lit streets. Chronically alone, Travis cannot connect with anyone, not even with such other cabbies as blowhard Wizard. He becomes infatuated with vapid blonde presidential campaign worker Betsy, who agrees to a date and then spurns Travis when he cluelessly takes her to a porno movie. After an encounter with a malevolent fare (played by Scorsese), the increasingly paranoid Travis begins to condition (and arm) himself for his imagined destiny, a mission that mutates from assassinating Betsy's candidate, Charles Palatine, to violently ""saving"" teen hooker Iris from her pimp, Sport. Travis' bloodbath turns him into a media hero; but has it truly calmed his mind? Written by Paul Schrader, Taxi Driver is an homage to and reworking of cinematic influences, a study of individual psychosis, and an acute diagnosis of the latently violent, media-fixated Vietnam era. <br/><br/>Scorsese and Schrader structure Travis' mission to save Iris as a film noir version of John Ford's late Western The Searchers (1956), aligning Travis with a mythology of American heroism while exposing that myth's obsessively violent underpinnings. Yet Travis' military record and assassination attempt, as well as Palatine's political platitudes, also ground Taxi Driver in its historical moment of American in the 1970s. Employing such techniques as Godardian jump cuts and ellipses, expressive camera moves and angles, and garish colors, all punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's eerie final score (finished the day he died), Scorsese presents a Manhattan skewed through Travis' point-of-view, where De Niro's now-famous ""You talking' to me"" improv becomes one more sign of Travis' madness. Shot during a New York summer heat wave and garbage strike, Taxi Driver got into trouble with the MPAA for its violence. Scorsese desaturated the color in the final shoot-out and got an R, and Taxi Driver surprised its unenthusiastic studio by becoming a box-office hit. <br/><br/>Released in the Bicentennial year, after Vietnam, Watergate, and attention-getting attempts on President Ford's life, Taxi Driver's intense portrait of a man and a society unhinged spoke resonantly to the mid-'70s audience -- too resonantly in the case of attempted Reagan assassin and Foster fan John W. Hinckley. Taxi Driver went on to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, but it lost the Best Picture Oscar to the more comforting Rocky. Anchored by De Niro's disturbing embodiment of ""God's lonely man,"" Taxi Driver remains a striking milestone of both Scorsese's career and 1970s Hollywood. <br/><br/>In summary,Taxi Driver must-see film for movie lovers, this Martin Scorsese masterpiece is as hard-hitting as it is compelling, with Robert De Niro at his best."

I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, ""What did I fight for?"" His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism. See this, but be prepared to keep changing positions in your seat."

","Gritty, grim, and depressing, ""Taxi Driver"" tells the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a desperately lonely Vietnam vet who takes a job as a New York City cabby. The job should, in theory, draw him closer to people. Instead, it does just the opposite. Through the endless repetition of impersonal contacts, the ever-present prostitutes and pimps, and all the other reminders of urban indifference and sleaze, Travis' loneliness and alienation deepen into concealed rage.<br/><br/>Both delusional and morally judgmental, Travis counters in the only way he knows how, by taking up arms, literally. In his words: ""Here's a man who would not take it anymore"". He shaves the sides of his head, he pumps iron to get physically fit, perfects his weapons skills, and sets out to be a one-man vigilante committee.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was, and still is, a relevant cinematic statement on urban alienation. The film's tone seesaws between menacing and dangerous on the one hand, and tawdry and seedy on the other, depending largely on Bernard Herrmann's excellent background music, and the moody neon of nighttime Manhattan. The taxi itself functions as a visual metaphor for loneliness.<br/><br/>The film looks and feels like typical 1970's drama: dark, downbeat, somber. There's almost no humor to offset the weighty subject matter. Dialogue is realistic for NYC street life. My major technical objection is the violence, which is overplayed. I did not much like the film's ending.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" has evolved into a cinematic classic, owing to its social message, Scorsese's direction, and Di Niro's flawless performance as the anti-hero at the center of the urban maelstrom. This is one of those films that a viewer can appreciate for its technical quality, but not really enjoy watching. Indeed, I find the film to be somewhat tedious to sit through. It's all just a bit too grungy and sordid for my taste."
"lschwartz106","Null","4","7","25 November 2004"," No Sympathy
","This film is memorable and is always a compelling piece of film-making. It offers a realistic view as the urban environment as the ultimate alien environment to a person who is incapable of connecting to other people. At the beginning of the film, we have sympathy for Travis. His thwarted efforts at trying to have a conversation with the woman who works behind the candy-counter in the porn theatre is pathetic. When Travis takes Betsy for coffee, we see him doing his best at getting the relationship off to a good start. We see a man who doesn't know the ""games"" that people often play in interpersonal encounters, and we are hoping that he gets a second chance with Betsy. But when he does, that's when our sympathies dissolve for Travis, and we realize how out-of-touch he is, how utterly socially inept he is. For the obvious reason that he takes this beautiful and educated woman to a sex film. How unaware and tasteless can a man be? Why should we feel sorry for Travis when his subsequent efforts to try to et back together with Betsy go rebuffed? From then on, we don't have a film about loneliness as the film claims to be, but a film about descent into madness. Travis becomes a comic-book character, who is acting in his own movie, albeit as either a cowboy or an Indian. Travis becomes an Action-Hero suffused with anomie. He becomes a socio-pathetic warrior in search of an enemy. His intentions with Iris are noble, but the means of execution are criminal. He becomes more violent and misanthropic than any of the sleazy characters he disdains."

","Utterly Amazing film and is unquestionably one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion Robert Deniro is one of the best actors of all time and his performance here is spellbinding (but more on that later). This film has incredible direction by Martin Scorsee and amazing performances all around. beware the finale is not for the faint of heart for casual viewers as it was incredibly graphic for it's time kinda tame now still very graphic indeed we get a very graphic gunshot to the head with blood and brains splattering on the wall a knife in the hand and arm blood everywhere in the finale and a few more graphic bloody gunshot wounds. For some reason i felt a little uneasy while watching this film but in a good way i was deeply disturbed by some of the scenes SPOILERS!! watching DeNiro fiddle around with those guns made me feel uneasy. The Acting is no doubt Oscar Worthy Robert Deniro is quite simply one of the best actors there ever was and ever will be (sorry to get off subject here when i say Arnold Schwarzenegger is my favorite actor i mean he's the most fun to watch not the best as far as acting goes in fact he's not really that great of an actor he is just a fun guy to watch. just wanted to let people know that Now Deniro is no doubt my favorite as far as acting is concerned and his performance here is simply amazing astounding words can't describe it he had me squirming in my seat with a sense uneasiness always he deserved to win That Oscar by far YOU RULE BOBBY!!!!!. Cybill Sheppard is beautiful and does great here wish she had more screen time though. Peter Boyle is also good here in his very limited screen time. Jodie Foster is an amazing actress and she took on a tough role here and did a wonderful job!. Harvey Keitel is the man and he cracked me up and looked funny with long hair (or was that a wig).

","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a riveting, disturbing and powerful masterpiece of a film that gives new meaning to the word ""snapped"".  The scenes, quotes and characters are legendary and so is this film giving breakthrough performances to Albert Brooks, Jodie Foster, and of course, Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a disturbed taxi driver who drives his taxi all around new York City going crazier every day.  He also meets Iris (AKA Easy) played by Foster who is also disturbed, but in a not as good way.  And what the story leads up to is one of the most memorable pieces of cinema ever. The film is great, the score by Bernard Hermann (his last) is excellent, and the feeling, and atmosphere is perfect.  So, ""are you talking to me""?"
"jef3914","5","7","15","6 March 2002"," A Critic's Film
","I just went back to this film for the first time in several years, and I'm afraid a dispassionate look at (and perhaps a re-examination of) Taxi Driver is in order. I was stunned by how substandard I found it, and made me realize that as many people as I've heard talk about how great a film it is, hardly anyone at all actually says they ENJOYED watching it. Just because something's bleak doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable; I'm sure you can all think of many films that fit both criteria (if you can't, go rent Saturday Night and Sunday Morning).  Not that there isn't a lot that's great about the movie, mostly down to Scorsese and De Niro, who both turn in extraordinary efforts. But--and the DVD version of the film helps point this out--the script is third rate (and could only have been written by a film critic), the story never really develops (the episodic format of the screenplay is an easy way out to avoid watching Travis Bickle's descent into anomie, instead we get to measure the regress by watching his hair grow shorter), and the other characters are little more than caricatures, as we never learn more about them (other than De Niro's and Jodie Foster's) after the first minute they are onscreen.<br/><br/>Rent or buy the DVD, read the script, and see how much better this film was made by Scorsese's ability to interpolate the ad libbing on the part of De Niro (and Harvey Keitel), and his amazing ability to capture NYC at its absolute nadir, when Bickle's description of the city to Senator Palantine is not overstatement. As for other performances, Jodie Foster is extremely good in a role that doesn't have her on the screen that long, Cybill Shepherd acts like a very attractive block of wood (her forte), and Albert Brooks plays yet another annoying guy. Keitel is superb as the pimp, but his chemistry with De Niro is the only such instance in the whole film.<br/><br/>
It's ultimately a beautifully filmed weak story, and even the line that everyone quotes ad nauseam (and no, I'm NOT talking to you) was ad libbed by De Niro. Wish he'd written the whole thing. I think the film critics' union banded together here to support one of their own. Watch it, but keep your eyes open."

And this is by far one of the worst of the type. It is so badly presented, and so poorly finished, that it makes Bronson's plain urban avengers and Eastwood's lust for violence real masterpieces. De Niro's acting is the only part that can be saved.

"DeathFish","10","8","18","27 May 2007"," Character development.
","Martin Scorsese's masterpiece Taxi Driver, was in the beginning met by various criticism and accusations. Many shut their eyes and were appalled by the violence and uncovered nature of the film. Even though judged by some, others witnessed the revelation of a genuine film-pearl, as Robert De Niro's character ""Travis Bickle"" entered the screen. The protagonist in this movie, is perhaps one the most complex and thorough characters in the history of film-making. Because of the extreme centralization of the main-character, the entire movies perspective takes basis in Travis' own perception and interpretation of the world around him. Every scene in the movie becomes, because of the focus on Travis, very subjective and personalized. We witness the world through his eyes, and take over his prejudices and beliefs. Travis lives in the busy and crowded city, but nonetheless he is alone. Loneliness is in many ways the very essence of his being, and at some point it almost becomes his identity. Walking through the streets alone, as a nobody, he dreams of being a somebody. He longs for company, both socially, sexually and intellectually, but cannot seem to find it anywhere. In his attempt to find company he finds Betsy, a young beautiful blond who develops an interest in him, but his social inexperience repels her from him, and he is left alone, even more lonely than before. The entire film is right from the beginning heading for the very debated violence near the end of the film, this also goes for Travis' life. His life has always in some way headed for this moment and therefore it is given even more importance. His Mohawk is a symbol of rage and lust for blood, which the native Indians possessed before they were going to battle, a so-called warning signal. The foundation of the movie is character development of the main character. This development is clouded and complex and at the same time obvious and simple. Only through repeated viewings can the full development of Travis be discovered and analyzed. Every little piece of conversation, monologue, action or sound plays a part in the corruption and development of Travis' mental state. The plot itself is very simple but still intriguing and luring. The cooperation, or lack of same, between Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader, has a fantastic influence on the film and gives it its' multidimensional flow. Basically everything from writing to screenplay, directing, acting and setup is superb and flawless. The movies many aspects and open possibility to interpretation, makes it ideal to repeated viewings and second thoughts. The directing is on top level, and the great debut by Jodie Foster together with Robert De Niro's fantastic acting makes sure that the entire potential of the movie is used. Fabulous achievement. 10/10"

","As every single other Scorcese movie, this one is strangely as well as massively overrated.<br/><br/>I'll make this simple: if you're not sucked into the senseless, remote action going on there's nothing left but the weakest and most pernicious and ambiguous moral at the end.<br/><br/>The film is completely random in every possible way: the worst way being at its core, it is nihilistic and unnecessarily bleak. The entire first part of the film for instance with Cybill Shepherd serves no purpose in the storyline but is rather a fully interchangeable/disposable introduction to the film and means to merely convey the notion Deniro's character longs for emotional connection and companionship, but they could've replaced that entire part with a number of other ones in a way that wouldn't shake up the story at all.<br/><br/>There's no explanation or significant reason for the turn of events and the change in texture and atmosphere of the film as Deniro's character becomes exceedingly more extreme: just as everything in this darn thing, conclusions are jumped to and never given a prior development. Things just happen, because the movie-makers (writer and director) were disturbingly inept at their jobs of creating coherent structure and developing a plot and its various ideas.<br/><br/>Some scenes are just purely random (why the attempted assassination of Palantine ?), added to the just as unnecessary violence and this here is only a 'personal nightmare' for the viewer, not Deniro's character and what not.<br/><br/>Philosophically bleak, not dark or haunting just bleak, as in stupid and morally violent, and pernicious. Influential ? This couldn't influence a hair in my nose. Terrible cinema, terrible story telling, terrible everything. Okay dialogue, De Niro's good...<br/><br/>2/10."

","I did not like this movie and I will be happy if I never see it again. The ONLY bright spot was Travis saving the 12 year old prostitute and sending her back home to her parents but I have to say I found the rest of the movie very confusing. For example, for a man who thought the city was full of immorality and degenerates why did he think it was all right to spent his free time in X Rated theaters? And what made him think it was OK to take a girl he just met to a porn film? Also, what possessed him to cut his hair into a mohawk and why did it appear that he was going to kill the nominee for president when he ended up killing Iris's pimp? The only answers I was able to come up with was as a former Marine, he needed to validate himself once he re-entered society. Since the secret service were onto him he went for the next best thing and managed to save a young girl in the process. Thank God all that porn didn't cloud the inappropriateness of a 12 year old turning tricks!"

","TAXI DRIVER tells the dramatic tale of Travis Bickle. He is a cab driver, who is haunted by disturbing images of New York City's dark undersides of crime, confusion, prostitution, and corruption. As Travis tries to integrate into the sleazy undertones of the city, he becomes obsessed by the environments around him. He is eventually driven to madness by urban decay.<br/><br/>The fast pace and disarray of New York is brilliantly demonstrated in this film. Travis, in search of anything that he can bond with, is forced into picking up prostitutes, often with very sad and bitter results. Various events, such as these, drive him further and further to the breaking point.<br/><br/>Great cinematography and acting however are compromised by an often very boring storyline where the viewer can not develop any type of connection to the other characters. Other than Travis, supporting actors seem to exist only in reactionary roles to show how the pain of the underworld effects him.<br/><br/>I was turned off as well by Travis' first person narratives. His ""diaries"" were no longer interesting after the first several entries and became monotonous. Travis doesn't really DO anything in terms of action sequences until near the end of the film. However, by this time, I was bored because I wanted something to happen on screen. TAXI DRIVER, can at times convey powerful psychological FEELINGS of HOW someone may respond to urban madness. But there is not enough action in the story to maintain interest throughout the film. Most viewers will know what is going to happen before it happens. You will also spend a great deal of time just waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>TAXI DRIVER is similar to looking at a mental health practitioner's notes on a patient who paints a road map that the person may be disturbed. It than tries to go inside the mind of the disturbed patient and the viewer is supposed to be incredibly absorbed into what he/she is thinking. But if you know the person or the similar situations presented by him/her in their own life, the practitioner's notes just reinforce what is already known.<br/><br/>Instead of surprises or strong action sequences, which TAXI DRIVER should have been, the viewers get a psychological road map of New York and its undertones as portrayed in Travis' mind with a predictable conclusion. This results in an OK film, but nowhere near what it could have been. Taxi Driver is overrated."

"michael-crooks-1","10","5","10","21 October 2007"," A character study of an angry loner
","Taxi Driver is a character study of Travis Bickle, an angry loner whose anger with the world drives him further and further towards violent rage. The intense focus of the movie on the personality of a single character, almost to the exclusion of the other characters, is reminiscent of Citizen Kane. Like Citizen Kane, the main character's personality is allowed to speak for itself and the viewer is left to interpret what the character's actions mean as best they can; like in real life, there are no easy answers that sum up who a person is.<br/><br/>It is this ambiguity that makes Taxi Driver such an engaging and intelligent film, as the viewer has to think for themselves about who Travis Bickle is, and what his motivations are. Reviewing the comments at IMDb shows that everyone draws their own conclusions.<br/><br/>I think he is and always was dangerously psychotic. I think his loneliness is self-created and not the fault of society; he is not shunned by his fellow taxi drivers when he approaches them, but never tries to be friendly with him. He has the capacity to meet people; after all, when he tries he walks straight into an office and picks up a gorgeous woman. Yet he can't maintain a normal relationship because he makes no attempt to maintain normal human interests like music and films; all he does to amuse himself is go to porno theaters. But neither is he unambiguously bad; he reaches out to a child prostitute and tries to help her. He is a flawed and complex person.<br/><br/>In the end he is hailed as a hero for freeing her and killing her pimps. In my opinion, people miss the significance of this ending. If all we knew about Travis Bickle came from the brief period of time when he thrust himself on the publics attention by killing pimps and helping a child prostitute, wouldn't we be inclined to view him as a vigilante hero, like the cop who breaks the rules and gets the bad guy while suspended? But it's only because we've seen his prior behavior, when he was a nobody and when nobody paid attention to him, that we can put his actions into context and see that his actions were motivated more by rage against the world and a desire for attention than any desire for justice. He could have just as well killed the senator and been a villain instead.<br/><br/>The acting, casting and cinematography of this film are all excellent. But for me what really puts this film on top and gives it a 10/10 is that is has the ambiguity and depth that rewards thinking and repeated viewing, that makes it engaging rather than being just something to watch."

","My brother commented that is was the weirdest movie he'd seen in a while and I have to admit it is definitely odd but strangely entertaining. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a disillusioned Vietnam Vet who goes to work as a Taxi Driver in NYC because he has nothing else to do. He comes into contact with some strange people which is OK as he is very strange himself. He meets a beautiful woman (Cybill Shepard) who is working to elect a Senator to the Presidency and he messes it up big time. He meets a extremely young girl (Jodie Foster) who works as a prostitute and works to save her from her predicament. You as the viewer watch Bickle lose himself and apparently his sanity minute by minute and somehow he pulls it together and you're simply amazed by the transformation. Scorsese and DeNiro are currently negotiating for a long overdue sequel and I hope they are able to do it. I know many fans have been wanting one for decades."

Mainly because of the good grades this movie got by critics and also from critics and I like De Niro and some of Scorsese's films (most of all GoodFellas) I taped this movie when it was on TV a few weeks ago. I started this movie thinking it would some kind of average or just above average movie, because I tend to not like some of those movies that are generally being enjoyed, like The Godfather, I think, even rated very high all the time it deserves a 6 or maybe 7 out of ten. But now getting to the movie, in my TV guide it got 4 out of four and the plot was outlined as, whacko Taxi Driver's life changes dramatically after a meet with someone. After the film starts you get some kind of average, what happpens in the life of a Taxi Diver, then he goes nuts (after 1 hour) and you think, YES, now it'll really begin. He buys guns and eventually even shoots a guy. And then evantually as before ... nothing, it goes on for another 20 minutes or 30 like that and then I just couldn't stand it no more. Nothing happens, this is JUST an average story about the pretty normal life of a man, that changes at a moment(I don't know  if this happened I didn't finish the movie), with average performances from the cast, without any thrills, chills, laughs, brutal scenes, touching moments and so on..........

This film's plot just seems to go all over the place. I didn't even know this was the movie with the famous line, ""You talking to me?"". That seems like such a generic thing to say, but I still think of it every time I say that. <br/><br/>The plot is that Robert DeNiro plays Travis, a taxi driver (duh!) who is dissatisfied with his job. He falls for a woman named Betsy, but their relationship ends badly. He tries to become physically stronger and more intimidating by working out and using all sorts of weapons. He comes across an underage prostitute named Iris. He decides to free her from her pimp. This is a movie where there's a lot going on, but it's still easy to pay attention to, which is always a plus.<br/><br/>Leonard Maltin shockingly only gave this film two out of four stars, complaining that it was too violent. Honestly, it's not really violent until the climax. What matters is how unbelievably 70's this movie is. It works so well as a time capsule, making you reflect on pop culture at that time. This film became infamous because it allegedly inspired Ronald Reagan's failed assassin, who wanted to impress Jodie Foster.

"a_chinn","10","3","5","15 October 2017"," Profoundly disturbing but brilliant tale of urban isolation, obsession, and rage
","Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film, writer Paul Schrader's best screenplay, and actor Robert De Niro's best performance. De Niro plays unstable Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who the film follows down his rabbit hole of isolation, obsession, and eventual violent rage. The plot, as it is, has Bickle working nights as a NYC cab driver, becoming infatuated with pretty campaign worker, Cybill Shepherd, but when he sours that relationship due to his weird behavior, he becomes obsessed with saving pre-teen hooker Jodie Foster from her slimy pimp, Harvey Keitel. The plot could easily have become a simple Charles Bronson/grindhouse tale of urban vigilantism, but it's much more than that. Much has been written about ""Taxi Driver"" in terms of urban decay, isolation, desire, sex, misogyny, and as a critique of the media, all by others more eloquent than me, so I won't even try, but I will say that on a visceral level, the film is a ferociously disturbing piece of filmmaking. The audience is slowly drawn closer and closer to Bickle's madness, in a similar way to ""Repulsion"" or ""Peeping Tom."". The audience almost understands and sympathizes with his where his thinking is coming from and are found rooting for him against the even more despicable of characters during the film's disturbing finale. Scorsese has presented a New York City that truly is a brutal urban nightmare, but at the same time has created surreal hallucinatory vision of NYC that may only be Bickle's perception of reality. Also of note, the film features memorable performances by Victor Argo, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. Additionally, this was the final film scored by Bernard Herrmann and he delivers a memorably unrelenting and oppressive score that ranks among his finest. Overall, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid, though due to it's profoundly disturbing nature will likely deny the film wide appeal."

","I have a friend. He also reviews movies. One day I had an idea that we should review each other's favorite movies. So I gave him my blu-ray of In Bruges, and he gave me his blu-ray of Taxi Driver. This review is dedicated to my friend.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a very controversial and interpretive movie. However, this being a spoiler-free review, I will not be able to elaborate on that very much. However, what I can do is highly suggest that you watch it, and interpret it, for yourself.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute masterpiece. I struggle to find any flaws with it at all. Martin Scorsese cements his place as one of the greatest film makers of all time. He paints a very bleak, immoral picture of New York City, dripping with filth and scum, allowing the camera to take the place of the protagonist's eyes. Almost every single shot is unchangeable, and every scene tends to hold so much more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>One of the strongest points about this film is it's protagonist, Travis Bickle, a painfully lonely ex-marine who sees New York as a revolting cesspool of irredeemable filth, and he wants to do something about it. Many people who watch this film will see Travis as a psychopath, and while I can certainly say that he is very deeply disturbed and unstable, insane is not a word I would use to describe him. Travis Bickle is one of the most complex and interesting characters that I have ever seen on the big or small screen, not to mention Robert De Niro's incredible performance. De Niro sinks into this role, to the point where you forget you're watching an actor in a movie. Although he didn't win the Oscar that year, he certainly deserved it.<br/><br/>But now for the very brief summary. What is this film about? Loneliness. Taxi Driver is an in-depth examination on the effects of loneliness and isolation on the individual. Without spoiling anything, loneliness is the main emotion pushing Travis's every action.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is an unquestionable masterpiece and one of the Scorsese's best. This is undoubtedly a must-watch for anybody with an appreciation for great film and is not to be missed."
"Leofwine_draca","10","3","5","9 November 2016"," An incredibly dark thriller with an exceptional central performance
","Quite rightly regarded as one of the best films of all time, TAXI DRIVER is without a doubt compelling viewing. What the film lacks in plot it makes up for in characterisation: De Niro is with us from the start, we follow on his journey as he slides into extreme violence and becomes a vigilante. Although it's obvious that this man is disturbed from the very beginning - a man who considers pornography to be ""just another movie"", who is always at breaking point. You can't really blame him though. After all, his empty life is forever surrounded by people who don't deserve to live, who don't deserve to populate this planet, and nobody is doing anything about it. It's up to Bickle to do the dirty work himself. He is the new rain coming down on the streets to clear away all the garbage.<br/><br/>Just about everyone involved here is extremely lucky in not putting a foot wrong. Martin Scorsese basks in his finest hour, even later classics like GOODFELLAS just can't hold a candle to match the intensity and complexity of this film. Check out the clever cameo where he plays a passenger spying on his cheating wife. The film focuses on De Niro's character, meaning that a lot of other roles are underwritten; Cybill Shepherd appears only fleetingly as a kind of idealistic fantasy figure. Jodie Foster excels as a child prostitute, hard and yet fragile at the same time, and Harvey Keitel is suitably slimy as a no-good pimp. In small roles are Peter Boyle and Joe Spinell. However it's De Niro who commands the screen, this is his film, we see things through his eyes. I don't think his quiet, brooding darkness here has ever been matched.<br/><br/>There are countless moments to enjoy. Bickle talking to a 'secret service' man, a deliciously pleasant conversation full of deceit and lies; the infamous ad-libbed sequence in front of the mirror, where ""You talking' to me?"" became a classic movie quote; the almost tragic conversations with Iris. The ending itself is a shock, a total bloodbath made all the more horrific because the violence has been relatively tame up to then. Only three people are killed, but each shot and stabbed a number of times; fingers a blown off, necks spray blood, faces riddled with holes, heads splattering over walls. And then the ironic ending, where Bickle is revered as a hero instead of a cold-blooded killer; a more telling portrait of today's society there couldn't be. For a study of the reasons a person is driven to extreme violence, you couldn't do much better than this."
"asifahsankhan","10","3","5","31 October 2016"," ""Are you talking' to me?"" —is one such line that will stun you forever!
","Some motion pictures produce the uncanny sensation of returning the spectator's gaze. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver—a movie in which the most celebrated line asks the audience, ""Are you talking' to me?""—is one such film. It came, it saw, it zapped the body politic right between the eyes.<br/><br/>The 12th top-grossing movie of 1976, Taxi Driver was not just a hit but, like Psycho or Bonnie and Clyde, an event in American popular culture—perhaps even an intervention. Inspired by one failed political assassination (the 1972 shooting of presidential hopeful George Wallace), it inadvertently motivated another (the 1981 attempt on President Ronald Reagan). The movie further established its 33-year- old director as both Hollywood's designated artist and, after Taxi Driver was awarded the Palme d'Or at Cannes, an international sensation—the decisive influence on neo–New Wave filmmakers as varied as Spike Lee, Wong Kar-wai, and Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Brilliant and yet repellent, at times even hateful, Taxi Driver inspired understandable ambivalence. (At Cannes, the announcement that it had won the Palme d'Or was greeted with boos.) How could reviewers not be wary? Taxi Driver is nakedly opposed even to itself, as well as the culture that produced it. For Travis, all movies are essentially pornographic; had he met his creators, he would surely, his history of Times Square, consider them purveyors of ""scum and filth."" It's the slow deliberation with which this lunatic kicks over his TV and terminates his connection to social reality that signals his madness—and the filmmaker's.<br/><br/>No nostalgia, though: In other aspects, the world of Taxi Driver is recognisably ours. Libidinal politics, celebrity worship, sexual exploitation, the fetishization of guns and violence, racial stereotyping, the fear of foreigners—not to mention the promise of apocalyptic religion—all remain. Taxi Driver lives. <br/><br/>See it again. And try to have a nice day!"
"Seraphion","6","3","5","3 October 2014"," A classic example of great acting without necessarily focused story.
","The movie goes on quite unclear about the main conflict that the main character has to settle. It seems like there is nothing that he is fighting for. This thing went on for almost the entire movie. The finale's result thus comes as a surprise. This lack of clarity and confusion also reflects in the scoring, changing back and forth between being romantic and being mysterious. I see the inspiration of some later works in this movie, which may include Al Pacino's Insomnia, The acting side, on the other hand, is very nice. We get to see Robert DeNiro's totality in plating his character here. Jodie Foster, despite her rather short duration time, manages to give her role a significant meaning. Albert Brooks and Harvey Keitel's presence bring more color to this movie."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","3","5","9 January 2011"," Still has the power to shock...
","Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the 70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances, the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening. There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Steffi_P","8","3","5","8 June 2007"," ""Morbid self-attention""
","This picture has been recognised as Scorcese's first masterpiece. It's not his first really great film  that would be Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (which I actually prefer to Taxi Driver)  but it's his first work as a really mature director. He'd shown talent before this, but there's just so much detail and control on display here.<br/><br/>Taxi driver is a film about two worlds as seen by Travis  the low-down, dirty underworld and the clean, respectable, ""normal"" world. Travis desperately wants to be part of the normal world but isn't equipped to break out of the low world. Scorcese's camera roves around in prowling point-of-view shots, to show us Travis' wandering mind. He makes great use of colour to create the two different worlds  grimy greys and greens for the low world, clean whites and reds for the high world. There are plenty of little details that add extra layers  for example the two guys arguing in the background during the opening scene.<br/><br/>Scorcese is often thought of as a modern director, part of a new wave. But actually Scorcese and this new wave were extremely retrospective. In Taxi Driver you can see shades of Hitchcock in the way he puts the audience inside the character's state of mind. He is like Kurosawa in the way he tailors his shooting style for different moods  particularly that director's High and Low. The character of Travis and the seedy world he inhabits also occasionally reminds me of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom as well. In terms of style Taxi Driver could have been made by any of these, by this time, elderly directors. It's only really the frankness of the sex and violence that mark it as the work of a young director.<br/><br/>Travis is the first of Scorcese's loser heroes. Like Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy, he does the ""wrong"" thing to achieve his aims, but ends up succeeding anyway. This is the most modern thing about Taxi Driver  it's the very opposite of Hollywood's old code of ""no crime without punishment"".<br/><br/>Like a lot of American cinema of this era, the Vietnam war casts its shadow over Taxi Driver. It's subtle  Travis is an ex-marine, and it's fairly clear his wartime experiences have contributed to his current state of mind. During the war there were plenty of heavy-handed allegorical films, and later there would be lots of heavy-handed films dealing with the war itself, but coming in between this is perhaps the harshest depiction of the Vietnam generation.<br/><br/>So yes, Taxi Driver is expertly constructed in terms of its direction. It's also brilliantly acted and scored (perhaps Bernard Hermann's best score). It's extremely bleak and difficult to watch though. While it's possible to sympathise with and understand Travis the picture lacks the humanity of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Raging Bull or King of Comedy, and it's never really spoken to me as deeply as any of those films."
"WriterDave","9","3","5","2 January 2007"," The Cinema of Alienation
","Working for the first time with misanthropic screenwriter Paul Schrader, and using Alfred Hitchcock's music score maker extraordinaire Bernard Hermann, Martin Scorsese crafted one of the bleakest and most memorable films about alienation with 1976's ""Taxi Driver"". Here we have the lonely cab driver Travis Bickle cruising the sleaziest streets in New York City, looking for love in all the wrong places, plotting his way to leave his mark with violence, and looking for redemption in the rescue of a child prostitute named Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).<br/><br/>Like the finest films from its decade, ""Taxi Driver"" is a intimate character-driven film haunted by the ghosts of Vietnam and Nixon-era politics that stained the psyche of the American people, especially those disenfranchised in the urban sectors. It's also a classic Scorsese story, nihilistic to the extreme, and containing what is still one of the most graphic and shocking bloodbaths when Travis Bickle finally goes on his rampage. The end result is quite ironic, and leaves a bitter halo imprinted on the viewer's mind.<br/><br/>By all accounts, this is a landmark film: one that heralded the first masterpiece from a director who would go on to a long and fruitful career, presented Robert DeNiro as a formidable headliner, and proclaimed Jodie Foster a serious actress. It's also one of the most controversial movies ever made, as it is the only film that can claim to have inspired an attempted presidential assassination when John Hinkle tried to shoot Ronald Reagan to impress Jodie Foster whom he became obsessed with after seeing this film, which is not too far removed from Travis Bickle's aborted attempt to kill a Senator to impress Cybil Shepherd's character. All of this makes ""Taxi Driver"" a film classic, albeit a very dark one that will always have many people crying foul."

","Perfect movie making, that includes a great lead actor, director and scored with perfect music. Some can relate to either the narrative or/and the character development. My father believes the film meant a lot to him in the seventies coming back from a war he didn't want to fight in, so its interesting to see how reverent it is today. The ending confused me."
"gavin6942","8","4","8","29 August 2009"," Well-Made Film, Though Not Sure It Stands Time For Me
","A taxi driver (Robert DeNiro) grows sick of the filth he sees in society, or at least New York. Attracted to a political campaign volunteer (Cybil Shepherd), he tries to find some redeeming qualities in life... but his brief hope in politics is dashed and he realizes the only way to clean up New York is with his own hands.<br/><br/>I am unsure how I feel about ""Taxi Driver"". I liked it. Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro are a great team, and the gritty violence of this film really is portrayed in a way that captures the viewer in a death grip. Jodie Foster is amazing, especially considering her age, and the historical place this movie has (given the Reagan shooting and all) makes it timeless regardless of the film's merits.<br/><br/>But it has its flaws. The film quality is grainy (though, as i say, this adds to the gritty feeling). Harvey Keitel, despite being a great actor, is in the wrong role. And compared to some of Scorsese's other work, this doesn't come across to me as some of his better material. His more recent contributions -- ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York"", for example -- are vastly superior in pretty much every way. While ""Taxi Driver"" is not a bad film, it is easily overshadowed by the other Scorsese offerings.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, I would recommend you do. If for no other reason than giving Scorsese a fair chance, this is worth checking out. The man has been sidelined for too long and someday critics and other people will look back and see his body of work as powerful and influential art."

"tlarry858","6","4","8","7 December 2002"," The film's claim to greatness is fatally marred.
","Director Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) is a famous, if somewhat infamous, film.  On the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest films of all time, Taxi Driver is listed at number 47, above The Third Man (1949), number 57; The Silence Of The Lambs (1991), number 65; and even Scorsese's much better film Goodfellas (1990), number 94.  Leonard Maltin (in Leonard Maltin's 2002 Movie and Video Guide) gives the film a less than perfect review.  Maltin writes, `To some, Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's perception of hell-as a crazed taxi driver's vision of N. Y. C.-was brilliant.  To us, this gory, cold-blooded story of sick man's lurid descent into violence is ugly and unredeeming' (p. 1362).<br/><br/>Is Taxi Driver a great film or a very bad one?  The film concerns Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), an ex-Marine, and his problems in reintegrating himself into a post-Vietnam American society.  Travis suffers periodically from severe migraines that may be a result of his war experiences (or his neuroses, fears, or perverse imagination-we never find out).  His migraines operate on a symbolic level as well.  Since Travis is in great physical condition, his sickness must be emotional or spiritual.  In fact, the film implies that Travis's sickness is twofold: barely suppressed rage plus a profound despair-that sickness unto death.  (And what is the source of his despair?  That too, we never learn.)<br/><br/>We know Travis is socially challenged; we know this because Travis takes Betsy, the girl whom he idolizes (Sybill Shepherd), to a porno film on their very first date.  She is supposedly a high-class, sensitive young woman whom he desperately wants to impress.  Has he no common sense?  Was he raised by monkeys?<br/><br/>It is as if there is something important lacking in him-something vital and alive that has become numbed by the war (which he never discusses or speaks about-a forbidden topic).  Oh, yes, he will admit he was in the Marines, but he goes no further.  He can connect with no one.  He is a product of a dysfunctional society-a new antihero, a rebel without a cause, but without the charisma of the Great Dean.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is simply that Travis doesn't care who is the recipient of his deadly anger, his repressed violence and savagery.  It's all the same to him-a presidential candidate or some low-life gangster. (Some film reviewers apparently miss or overlook the fact that Travis first means to kill Senator Charles Palantine [Leonard Harris], the politician whom Betsy works for.  Only after being thwarted in this unmotivated attempt, does he decide to whack the mobsters who menace Iris Steensma (Jodie Foster), the pint-size prostitute.)<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film, despite its great power and marvelous acting, is a cold-blooded work of art.  As in the Beatles's Eleanor Rigby, Scorsese walks from the grave, the death-in-life of an urban cesspool, and no one is saved. There is no hope, no vision, and no teleology that results from all of the frenetic activity.  There is no appeal to basic humanity or to religious or moral or ethical values or beliefs.  Perhaps the film's claim to greatness is fatally marred.  That the flaw is in humanity itself is no great consolation."

","""Taxi Driver"" is an American classic. Very early in any cinephile's journey it will come up as a must watch film. This carries with it a danger, though. For some, like myself, they end up seeing Taxi Driver when they aren't really mature enough as a film watcher do appreciate it.<br/><br/>After seeing Paul Schrader's ""First Reformed,"" I wanted to dig into more of his films and while he didn't direct ""Taxi Driver,"" he did write it. I'm also not a big Scorsese fan but really it's more that I'm not a fan of gangster films and he makes a lot of them. I love Scorsese when he isn't doing the mob, so I wanted to revisit ""Taxi Driver,"" for that reason as well.<br/><br/>A Scorsese film I have a shot at liking? I couldn't let myself go on, disliking Taxi Driver just because I was too young when I saw it the first time.<br/><br/>So there was definitely a lot about this film that I didn't understand or catch the first time I saw it. Having been raised pretty conservatively I was not aware of many of the issues Bickle was dealing with throughout the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps more than anything else though, the thing that I most didn't get when I was younger was that it is a character study.<br/><br/>I remember feeling that nothing was happening in the film when I watched it the first time. For someone whose main movie experience is with typical Hollywood fare, a film which simply follows a person around and the main plot is happening within the inner workings of their brain, is a bit alien feeling.<br/><br/>As an more experienced cinephile, I now appreciate and can see what the film is doing, even in the moments which I do not relate to as well."

The raw emotions and portrayal by the young actor are so good it makes you realize how talented the duo of Scorsese- De Niro is. Jodie Foster is impeccable as the young prostitute and the writing of Paul Shrader keenly exposes the cesspool of 1970s America(New York City to be specific)- one of the best character sketches in all of cinema.

"treykirssin","10","2","3","23 June 2018"," The Greatest Film of the 1970s
","Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" is one of those movies that sticks in your mind for a long time after you see it. You know the kind. I don't mean the interchangeable gorefests, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. This is a film that haunts us not with blood and gore (although there is plenty of that), but with its unflinching portrayal of the protagonist, Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>Travis is simply one of the greatest movie characters of all time. Despite his noirish voice-overs, he never really tells us exactly how he's feeling-yet we feel like we're almost inside of his brain the entire film. The trifecta of Scorsese's direction, Paul Schrader's script, and Robert De Niro's performance paint a vivid picture of this troubled soul without words having to come into play.<br/><br/>First things first, Travis is not a good guy. But that doesn't mean that he's unsympathetic. We can see how isolated and distanced he is from the rest of society, and recognize his attempts to reintegrate himself. We would like him to succeed. But we know he won't because the series of events in this movie feels as inevitable as a ticking clock.<br/><br/>The movie gives us a sense of how impotent Travis feels among the everyday crime of the city. The early scenes are painful, as Travis attempts to woo Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) on a date in which he takes her to a pornographic theater. After that fails, he talks to fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle), looking for advice about the bad thoughts he's been having in a rare moment of self-reflection. But Wizard offers him nothing in return, and this is the moment in the film where Travis enters the void. He makes an attempt to assassinate the political candidate Betsy is campaigning for, but after that falls through as well, he decides to go on one final suicide mission, saving the underage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster, in one of the best adolescent performances I've ever seen) from her pimp (Harvey Keitel). The climax is chilling, as Travis walks into the whorehouse fully armed and blows everyone in the place away, the camera switching to slow motion to embody his complete detachment from his actions.<br/><br/>And this is where we get to the heart of the film. In an earlier scene, as Travis is rejected by Betsy over the phone, Scorsese slides the camera over to show an empty hallway, saying that it's as if we can't bear the pain of seeing Travis rejected. However, by the slow-motion finale, Travis, by way of his isolation and loneliness, has become so numb to what he sees around him that he doesn't even connect pulling the trigger with killing a human being. In his eyes, he's just pushing a button to solve a problem. In this aspect, the film remains more relevant than ever, as it goes a long way towards explaining why so many seemingly pointless crimes are committed every single day.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is absolutely flawless in his greatest performance. He possesses the rare skill of convincingly showing one emotion to the characters around him while also signifying to the audience what he's actually thinking. He plays a different type of role than the macho, charismatic type he usually plays in Scorsese's films (think ""Mean Streets"" and ""Goodfellas""), and he never steps wrong, whether he's portraying social awkwardness, deep loneliness, or, finally, a vengeful wrath.<br/><br/>Scorsese's camera has never been so restless and searching, his New York never so dystopian and hopeless, his view never so bleak and grim. What he's showing us is hell on earth, and you feel it in every scene.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" has as much hope as the desert has water, a portrayal of how depression and despair can lead to unthinkable acts. After it's all over, we have to ask ourselves: has anything really changed?"

Under the cloak of the night, he cruises the City and gets to witness a reality that is not socially suitable for daytime mores. In the course of one of such rides, Travis is faced with a wilting flower that causes him to pause and reassess the many spheres he transits through daily. Out of this dualism, Travis' perverted views of reality start to materialize and, as such, he becomes both hero and hitman.<br/><br/>A Mohawk, then, ensues. <br/><br/>But one miscalculated move leads to a heartbreak that drives Travis over the edge. Then, heavily armed and washing his meds down with beer, he sets out to right two wrongs; one perceived and the other actual. A failed murder attempt, symbolic of Travis' inner naïveté, leads to an impetuous and bloody showdown that brings him to a near-ultimate atonement before a pseudo trinity.<br/><br/>As a result, one Iris is set free and is back in due full bloom.

","Taxi Driver has become such a staple of modern cinema that it's become cliche to call it a classic film; needless to say I firmly stand by this status-quo for the film and I love it for the neo-noir psychological drama I see it for. This is a film truly exploiting its complicated time-period and all the post-'Nam trauma Americans suffered because of the costly tirade. And who else other than Robert De Niro to showcase a grungy story about late-1970s New York involving cinema's most famous taxi-driver: Travis Bickle?<br/><br/>This is not a film for casual-movie lovers: Taxi Driver is a subtle, psychological and violent film that speaks volumes about the psychology of war-veterans trying to keep a normal life for themselves. Travis Bickle is a traumatized but street-weary soul who means well, but he can't overcome his droll post-war trauma and day-to-day; he's a misunderstood man who is never truly empathized by any of the supporting characters, but the film's audience does. Travis is the sort of character made for cinema whereas any other medium would've worked against the point they're making with Travis; loneliness is hard to depict in a non-expository manner and it takes the big-screen to show how isolation really feels. Travis wants to clean the streets of what he sees as 'filth' but he has involuntarily BECOME part of that filth himself. We're with him all the way, but we can't help but feel sorry for him and his mental-illnesses that he carries with him throughout the story.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is one of cinema's finest masterpieces that's still as relevant today as it was in the 1970s. It's period-cinema that still has a lot to say about mental-illness in its 70s context, and in a contemporary context. Truly a genius work of art that has no equal. 5/5 stars."

It's still a good movie but, in my view, no longer the great and ground- breaking movie that it was back then.<br/><br/>What I liked. Well, I liked De Niro in his first serious appearance in a well funded movie. And Jodie Foster was sensationally good in her first box office movie at the age of 13. The script was well written and the movie impressively directed by Scorsese although special effects were pretty much in their infancy back in '76.<br/><br/>What I didn't like (now anyway). Well, I came to detest that sax ""melody"" which was repeated ad nauseum all the way through the movie. It got to be like finger- nails on a blackboard to me by half way through. Why in God's name couldn't Scorsese see that all that repetition of something so tuneless would really get on people's nerves after the 8th or the 10th time? Cybil Shepherd was fine but how about Albert Brookes with that stupid 70s hair and, let's be honest here, he was never really an actor was he?<br/><br/>Something else too. I just can't work out how someone/anyone can pre- meditatedly murder three people and walk free from Gaol to continue his life as a cab driver.

","The 'Taxi Driver' (1976) written by Paul Schrader, directed by the master Martin Scorsese and played by Robert De Niro as its lead protagonist is considered a cinematic spectacle that diagnoses the 'scums' and 'filthness' of a consolidating liberalism hegemony that was at its embryonic stage during the 1970s. The principle protagonist is Travis ( played by Robert De Niro) who is a marine and a Vietnam war veteran who works as a Taxi driver in New York. Travis is a weird figure who seems mentally unstable and an introvert detached from society.<br/><br/>Travis apparently suffers from insomnia and shows profound introvert characteristics with vague gazes and looks diverted while interacting with his taxi drivers colleagues. He lives alone far away from his parents, he doesn't follow politics or arts(music) and seems disaffected from societal efforts of betterment and improvement. For Him evil reigns and even politicians cannot fix it. This normative and boring life of Travis is reinvigorated with purpose and value as he come across a young preadolescence blond prostitute named Iris ( Jodie Foster) who is being pimped by gangsters. He goes into gun battle with the gangsters and saves Iris while he himself later recovers from coma to proceeds with his work as a taxi driver.<br/><br/>The 'Taxi Driver' narrates a story of an ailing society and the inaction and docility in the face of this danger that's engulfing this modern society of ours. The messiah is a 'white man' (Travis) who once shoots in the face a Black robber. De Niro and Jodie Foster act superb and are captivating to the audience. The 'Taxi driver' is more relevant now than in the 1970s, when society is growing dis-affectionate to politics or Hope of an' alternative world' in the face of a naturalized neo-liberal ideology that disregards and undermines 'the will of the people' as the fictitious presidential candidate in the Film puts correctly. The ripples that the 'Taxi driver' initiated in the 'cinema of Politics' will reverberate throughout time."
"erickmelof","10","2","3","11 February 2017"," One of my favorites
","Taxi Driver is my favorite film from the director Martin Scorsese and it's definitely one my favorites movies of all time. It's brilliant direction, remarkable acting, deep writing, the dark 70's New York atmosphere that gets even better with the beautiful soundtrack score, everything is just perfect.<br/><br/>The movie is about this Vietnam War veteran (Robert DeNiro at it's finest) that needs to get a job and, because of his insomnia problem, he decides to get the taxi's night shift. In the meantime, he gets attached to a beautiful woman working on a political campaign (gorgeous Cybill Shepherd), and to a teenager working as a prostitute (early and prodigious Jodie Foster). The rest is history.<br/><br/>Going against the trending of the time, instead of showing a wonderful and perfect New York City, the film exposes the bad and dangerous side of the town: crime, prostitution, trending porn theaters. It matches with the story.<br/><br/>There are numerous reasons of why you should watch Taxi Driver. It's a classic, it's in Robert DeNiro's, Jodie Foster's, Bernard Herrmann's and Scorsese's curriculum, it's deep dialogues and monologues... It's an excellent film."
"LuchinoP","10","2","3","3 February 2017"," Scorsese's finest hour - and that's saying something
","Many filmmakers have tried to tackle the ""isolated"" and ""alienated"" individual (and usually end up excreting pretentious borefests consisting of a solemn individual staring at walls and smoking cigarettes, preferably in French) but 'Taxi Driver' is the real deal. No other film has dealt with alienation and loneliness in such a raw and hard-hitting way. Travis' downward spiral of ever increasing disconnection from the outer world and festering disgust toward it is darker than any horror movie I've ever seen - watch the scene with the jealous husband (played by Scorsese himself) for a demonstration.<br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' has it all: the top-notch performances (especially De Niro's portrayal of the disaffected titular character), Bernard Herrman's moody score (which maintains a sense of underlying threat, with the gentler moments only lasting so long before those 'ill- boding' horns and drums come marching in again) and the gritty visuals - New York really does look like Hell's Kitchen here, with the steam from the sewers, the sleazy reddened neon-lights and the pimps/hookers/junkies/crooks roaming the sidewalks like walking dead transforming the city to some sort of nocturnal urban pandemonium. <br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' drives on pure raw emotion and mood, and is one of those rare cinematic jewels worthy of the abundance of praise it constantly receives. Perhaps Scorsese's finest hour."
"msweetlv","10","2","3","25 January 2017"," ""Keep the Meter Running""
","The Mastermind Scorsese created this neo-noir thriller fueled, not just with the unleaded Travis's busted leased cab needs, but also with some of the (raw-est) acting I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Seemingly harmless Marine Vet Travis Bickle, having issues sleeping takes up a graveyard cab shift to help him pass his meaningless hours. This cabbie takes a liking to a young desk clerk campaigning for the upcoming presidential candidate. After losing her interest by taking her to see some ""Swedish smut film"" he becomes obsessed with being part of her life. Losing ""the girl"" pushes Travis deeper into isolation, and a loneliness that he cant even express to his cabbie friends.<br/><br/>During the Film Travis progressively loses touch with society, and decides to take the responsibility of cleaning up the slums of New York. De Niro, envelopes this sense of a ""hero's innocence"" when his character justifies his paranoid, and violent actions and evokes a feeling mental instability that truly deserves the Oscar he won. <br/><br/>Regardless of the year this was released, this film is truly one of the greatest Film-Noir movies ever made. From the opening sequence, to the last ""So long"" , this movie is a masterpiece ."
"nicholas-40387","10","2","3","2 January 2017"," Taxi Driver is an experience
","Taxi driver is a movie that delivers a cinematic experience like very few. It follows the character Travis Bickle in a 70's New York filled with drugs, sex and drink which he hates and wishes never existed. However unfortunately for him it does and he wants to do as much as he can about it and he attempts to but whilst trying to live a 'normal' life. However he soon realises that people aren't what he thought they were. <br/><br/>This constant struggle in accepting society torments him and the audience throughout the movie with tense on screen acting from DeNiro and the sexy yet disturbing score by Mr Hermann. <br/><br/>Altogether whilst this film isn't as simple and playful as the likes of other Scorsese movies such as Casino or Goodfellas, it's certainly one that requires more thought and complexity to the nature of humanity, and for that reason I personally prefer this picture to the rest of his."
"blanoue324","9","2","3","6 December 2016"," Great movie but kinda disturbing
","Martin Scorsese made a really good movie. The whole movie has a really amazing sound track. All sorts of background noises make it really seem like your in NYC. Robert De Niro was amazing in his role as this insomniac. Jodie foster plays a young girl and she is excellent in her performance. She plays a very important role in the movie but she only spends a couple minutes in it. When he says his inner thoughts in his head it gets pretty creepy. The whole movie is basically a spiral into darkness. The camera work is amazing. There are all sorts of weird camera techniques like the top down view after he fights the gangsters. Top down isn't a normal view and it makes you think he died like if he was having a out of body experience. There is also extensive use of mirrors to show De Niro's eyes while he's in the cab and in other places too. The music track is also really good. The saxophone is used very often but sometimes there is darker music alluding to possible darker things happening. The movie finishes on the brighter side with him turning out as a hero instead of an assassin. The movie is very good but it can be very disturbing."

","Wow, I can't believe it took me this long to getting around to watching this movie. I was on vacation earlier this week, saw it On Demand and finally decided to give it a try. I thought I had an idea of what the movie would be like, but I was off, and that's a good thing. This had a great story, great acting, great script, great directing, and great suspense. I absolutely love the raw classic look of the 1970's. <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro stars as Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old honorably discharged U.S. Marine. He's depressed and lonely and drives a taxi to make money. He soon becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Their relationship is quite awkward. He also becomes interested in helping a teen prostitute named Iris (played by a young Jodie Foster) get out of the hooker life. Travis becomes a vigilante by buying up guns and tries to help clean New York of corruption and overbearing pimps. I will consider buying the 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray of this film. I highly recommend TAXI DRIVER!!!"

"midas-jacobs","10","2","3","24 January 2016"," ""You talking to me?""
","In this Martin Scorsesse film, we get to know Travis Bickle. Travis is an unstable Vietnam war veteran, who now works as a taxi driver. During one of his night routines, he meets a young girl, who is by his believe a girl forced into prostitution, and now he wants to save her and make the world a better place.<br/><br/>Like I have said this movie is directed by Martin Scorsesse. Scorsesse is an amazing director. I haven't seen a lot of him, yet, but I really want to see them all. He uses a lot of steady cam. My favorite style. To my knowledge there was no shaky cam. This can be obnoxious at times, so luckily this wasn't there. The cinematography is very pretty. This was done by Micheal Chapman. He has worked with Scorsesse for a couple of other times. The clothing and clothes overall were great. There are iconic items in there (the clothes of De Niro) The make-up was fine, just the fake blood. It really looked fake. the colors just didn't fit. But I have read a reason for this, so I understand why they did this. The pacing of this movie is fantastic. It starts of kind of slow, but then near the end it speeds up. And due to this you gets this tense feel, which is very good. The music is very interesting chosen, in the beginning, I was a bit skeptical about it, it looked to me that it didn't fit, but at the end of the movie I thought that it was a very well chosen soundtrack, which fitted the theme.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless. I absolutely adored the acting of De Niro. Robert De Niro played Travis, the taxi driver. He was a very interesting character, because he is so unpredictable. I liked that they first showed us his daily routine, how he talks to his friends and so on. But then how he gets paranoid, and crazy. You can notice it actually pretty early on in the movie, and this may sound stupid to a lot of you, when he looks at the glass of soda in the cafeteria. And the camera focuses on it from above. For me this showed who Travis is, by just a glass of soda. And that is one of the reason why I loved this movie, how they could just show a entire character in one shot. This was/is one of Robert De Niros best movies ever in my opinion (havn't seen Raging Bull) The next person I am going to discus is Jodie Foster. This is one of her first roles, if not her first. She was fantastic too. She played the prostitute, called Iris. De Niros character wants to save her, so she can have a better live, a normal live. Her character was less interesting as Travis, but I still liked her though. Jodie Foster was convincing, and had a very good portraying. Now the group of taxi drivers. They were all very realistic. They felt real, and looked like real taxi drivers. The last person I am going to talk about played the character called Betsy. Cybill Shepherd played her. In this movie, she has a sort of relationship with Travis. What I really liked was the chemistry between them. And how she helped him to get driven of the edge, so he will snap. Well, she did it without the knowledge about it, but still.<br/><br/>The script was written by Paul Schrader. It is a very good script. Here are also Iconic elements, like the ""You talking to me?' scene, but this isn't my favorite scene, although they portray really good how crazy he has already become. My favorite scene is when Travis picks up a pedestrian, who is ultimately going to kill his wive. I really liked this scene, because it sort of showed us how Travis will be. It was a tensful scene, with very good dialogue, that is why this scene stood out to me. I didn't even realize that it was Scorsesse himself playing that man, and now I am surprised to know that. It was very well acted on his side, and of course on De Niros side as well. The narration in the beginning of the movie is good. By using this, we get to know Travis better. And we can also see inside of his head, which also helps with portraying the craziness. <br/><br/>If you combine all of the good elements I have just said, you will get a dark, realistic portraying of a man who is losing his mind. But with great cinematography, acting and writing. I absolutely loved this movie. It is one of those movies, that only get better, the more you think about them. I would definitely recommend watching this classic!"

","Taxi Driver is one of those films that I know everything about and yet, in reality, know nothing. I thought I'd seen it several times before and yet, this was the very first time.<br/><br/>In fact, I know so little about this film, I'm pretty sure I'm watching a tale about the day-in-the-life experiences of a taxi driver, including the multiple personalities he picks up along the way. My instincts tell me though that something different, perhaps even bizarre, is going to happen, but I'd be just as content to see De Niro get together with the beautiful blonde and ride off into the sunset, but somehow I know this isn't going to happen.<br/><br/>I imagined something brash and vulgar, but instead it's a superbly laid-back and relaxing experience. The camera work is astonishing too, with such clear lines and easy angles.<br/><br/>Even though I know nothing about this film, I can still perceive its importance. Is it a story about a confused man coming to terms with being a straightforward taxi driver, or a man that's gradually going out of his mind, sliding through the sewer of life?<br/><br/>In case, just like me, you think you've seen this film before but really haven't, I'm telling you - it's an absolutely excellent, rewarding film that casts aside pre-conceptions of backstreet trashiness and replaces them with a newly found respect for mankind, it's that powerful.<br/><br/>A 10/10 viewing experience without any shadow of a doubt."
"raphaklopper","10","2","3","17 June 2013"," That is not Robert De Niro! THAT IS NOT ROBERT DE NIRO, it is Travis Bickle, one of the best characters ever created!
","Who said that lonely people could never be totally badasses and be true heroes?? Well, with that, I meant exactly what this masterpiece by Martin Scorsese tried and managed to show to the world, and again on the main stage of most of his films, the city of New York.<br/><br/>In the movie we have the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a veteran of the Vietnam War who lives in his small apartment in the big apple. Travis has severe sleep problems suffering of insomnia, staying up all night, then he decides to work as a taxi driver. Managing to work day and night and earn a good salary. During his travels he meets and falls in love for the beautiful Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works in the presidential campaign of the Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). Travis becomes obsessed with Betsy, following her to work, to her home and finally one day he finally call her out, but loses the chance of having a relationship when he takes her to watch a porno movie. With the loving disappointment Travis goes crazy and starts trying to take justice into their own hands. He gets this chance when he meets the young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster).<br/><br/>Through this simple story and the character Travis, Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader were able to explore and send a message and critique against the society. What at the beginning seems to be a study of the human condition with the character Travis (which partly is), it is actually a great criticism that Scorsese make against society showing its dirt and evil.<br/><br/>Travis is all part of this critic, a veteran returned form war and working as a taxi driver he gets to know various types of people, moreover working at night. Travis begins to have its own philosophy what is good and evil in the city. The night he seems to see the devil walking through the streets in the bodies of prostitutes and drug dealers, and he sees himself as the renegade hero trying to do justice in some way, trying to send a message, which after several failed attempts. At that point he meets Iris, he finally sees his chance, a poor girl in the middle of all evil suffering at the hands of clients and dirty cowards, Travis then begins to act.<br/><br/>Not only the story is very well written and explored in a brilliant way, while Scorsese through his direction in a large scale gives a realistic and dirty picture of New York society, showing the dirt and lack of respect and kindness (even his appearance in the film as a customer of Travis help it). But to make everything more pretty he also shows several places of the city, all of them connected to the story.<br/><br/>At the level of writing and directing the film is simply fantastic, and the performances are not different. All excellent, Jodie Foster superb as always, as much as she was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and most of all her work; Robert De Niro..... PERFECT, embodies his character in an impressive way, while we watch the movie we always forget that is not Travis who is driving the Taxi and talking to himself to the mirror (with that I mean we forgot that is a movie at all).<br/><br/>A true masterpiece, explores the society in a realistic and obscure way. Thanks to a fantastic writing and direction that created an unforgettable character with superb performances and an ending that makes us open a big smile on our face, ""Taxi Driver"" has invisible flaws being a true classic of cinema, one more that Scorsese gave us, an unforgettable film and a dark and fun experience."
"carol-white99","9","2","3","21 March 2012"," Classic Deniro at his best!
","'Taxi Driver' remains one of the most fascinating and intriguing movies ever made in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Critics have stated it to be Scorsese's best and perhaps it's one of the most quoted films. Paul Schrader's riveting screenplay is very detailed and layered. It's very much based on his own experience which is probably why it's so rich in atmosphere and depth and obviously, not to forget, the memorable lines. Scorsese does a commendable job bringing it to screen. Aweseome director that he is, he puts it all together wonderfully. The fluid narration, the haunting score (comprised mostly of some fantastic saxophone pieces), the brilliant lighting, solid cinematography etc work together effectively. Moreover, Scorsese definitely captures the rawness and stark reality of the harsh street life that Bickle witnesses every night. Robert De Niro delivers one of his most memorable performances as Travis Bickle. His understated portrayal of the title character is still a much talked about discussion. While this is clearly De Niro's film, he is aptly supported by a stunning Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle and Jodie Foster."

","The presence of Robert De Niro--in the title role--is the most important reason why this work is an outstanding motion picture. He completely becomes--Travis Bickle--a socio/psycho-path. An incredible achievement....and De Niros finest hour. He refused to break character during filming---and made some of his co-players --a little nervous on set. Martin Scorsese uses some wonderfully inventive direction---but his usual sloppiness --in relation to continuity--is there for all to see. Writer Paul Schraver wrote a great script---very New York --but universal in its examination of loneliness. However--it is the gradual disintegration of Bickle--into madness, that is the rock solid viewing foundation of this Classic movie experience."
"ElMaruecan82","10","2","3","4 February 2011"," The Roots of Violence through a Powerful Character Study ...
","From the dark and misty streets of New York City's nights, two eyes contemplate the desolated degradation of society  the one who sees is Travis Bickle, Martin Scorsese's most tormented character, a cinematic icon who, through Robert De Niro's unforgettable performance, personifies the roots of violence in the most significant way.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle, less by vocation than because of his insomnia, works as a nighttime taxi driver. The sleeping problem is the reason of Travis' job, and certainly not the cure for the alienating feeling about to ravage his soul, the torment devouring his heart, despite a ""clear conscience"". The opening shot of the film is a close-up on Travis' eyes; literally, he can't sleep means he can't shut his eyes, he can't ignore what happens before them. He sees because he's lucid. Junkies, whores, drug-selling pimps etc, all the miserable and rotten (low) life of the disillusioned post-Watergate America inspires Travis a pitiless comment: a rain should come out and wash all this filth. This rain is expected as redemption, creating at the same time, a psychological discomfort due to the guilt of being a simple observant just waiting  The filth sticks on Travis' soul like dirt on clothes and in his mind, if you're a watcher, you're part of the filth, if you're not, you're a 'washer'. Watcher or washer, it seems easier to plant seeds of violence in a land of guilt, and Travis' heart is full of it, like the majority of Marty's lead characters <br/><br/>Travis' psychological odyssey is constantly written in a diary, through a daily routine monotonically regulated by the meter. The meter governs Travis' life like the clock of a psychological ticking bomb, which is is almost defused by an angelic creature named Betsy, a beautiful sophisticated blonde, played by Cybill Shepherd, and crystallizing whatever Travis needs to become a better man. Symbolically, when she notices him the first time, it's raining as if she was the providential rain that would wash Travis' dirtied soul  And the interactions between Travis and Betsy emphasize the intelligence of the film, because it raises an interesting question about Travis's responsibilities in his psychological troubles. Is he necessarily a victim of the system? Of a post-Vietnam trauma, or any other alienation? or is he just a social misfit in the pathetic sense of the word? <br/><br/>Travis Bickle was listed number 30 on AFI's Top 50 cinematic villains; many will argue he's an antihero. I don't think his outcast status should automatically prevent him from the 'villain' label, which doesn't make him any less fascinating. Anti-hero or villain, he's clearly a sociopath driven by a growing feeling of hostility which after the rejection by his country, by society, and women, hit him like a real psychic boomerang. The gap between Travis and society grows larger, and nature hates emptiness. Gaps must be filled. When Travis criticized Betsy's nerdy colleague, he indirectly summed up his personal philosophy ""he puts his energy in the wrong directions"", he said. Life is about putting energy somewhere. And Travis is not suicidal, despite his troubles. Travis' life is about filling gaps, which catalyzes his decision not to be a watcher, these are the roots of violence: not to take it anymore. We're not born violent, it's an existential choice expressed through acts, not thoughts. Violence is a physical energy; the rest is bullshit, pure hypocrisy like denouncing a situation without having the guts to fight it.<br/><br/>Travis doesn't belong to the street, to society, so when all the efforts for normality and happiness become useless rejection, frustration, anger, alienation, all that negative energy plants seeds of violence in the land of guilt, to let a ferocious desire of revenge grow. Travis' energy is injected in a new skin, for a new goal, a selfish one, a redeeming one, in his burning eyes: revenge. The ticking bomb works again, and the explosion is imminent.<br/><br/>Travis' legendary training, canalizing 100% of his energy for revenge, builds him a kind of supernatural strength through push-ups, exercises to increase pain resistance, and rapidity to draw a gun. The legendary ""You're talking to me"" scene, one of the most impacting and iconic movie quotes, can be summed up in one word: paranoia. Travis imagines himself talking to his victim; eager to be pushed, to have an excuse to use his gun. He asks for trouble, any opportunity to pull the trigger is welcome, and he's not afraid, he's got nothing to lose. Violent skills and paranoia, the deathblow that start the tickling bomb's countdown  <br/><br/>Travis has two choices: and violence is the medium of both, one is an assassination attempt and the other, concerns the situation of an underage prostitute, Iris, portrayed in a scarily authentic performance by a young Jodie Foster. Like the iris, she lives in the middle of Travis' eyes, in the center of his thoughts. She's an innocent flower that needs help, and she's Travis redemption. He can be a killer or a hero but the point of the film is not to make us root for Travis, but to show how violence works as a hazardous double edged sword. A bloody massacre can have positive consequences by purging bad blood, just like good intentions can pave the road to hell. In both cases, violence acts as a redeemer for the guilt-carrier soul, and as en exorcism of the frustration and anger's demons, violence like an operatic climax of alienation.<br/><br/>Marty's masterpiece is a character study that invites us to explore the very roots of violence, through Travis Bickle, a character who's 'talking to us' by writing redemption in bloody letters, redeeming violence no less horrifying than the condemnable one. The irony is that after watching Marty's masterpiece, even the most horrifyingly violent acts that can't be justified, can at least be explained. Indeed, even the victims are not always innocent"

","""Taxi driver"" is not only one the greatest films of the Seventies, it's also the best Scorsese & De Niro production.<br/><br/>A Vietnam veteran, now a New York taxi driver, lives in a nightmarish loneliness. The meeting with a baby prostitute and the will of rescuing her will give him a new aim.<br/><br/>The movie is dramatic and passionate. It's a story of an anti-hero who wants to save another anti-heroin. Also when he tries to court another woman (Cybill Shepherd) the result is a complete disaster (look at the scenes...!), it's impossible for him to enter a ""normal"" world. There's an anguish sense through all the movie, underlined by Bernard Herrman score. Definitely ""Taxi driver"" is the momentum of the ""nouvelle vague"" in Hollywood movies. Actually the Seventies were the only time when big studios really allowed independent directors to do their own films. Now these two worlds are more separated than before.<br/><br/>This film won the ""Palme d'or"" at Cannes Film festival in 1976, and brought chance to Scorsese, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel and (of course) Robert De Niro -the same year he made Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Novecento"", the year before he won an Oscar for ""The Godfather part II""."

","SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>On the first viewing of this monumental picture I was pretty convinced that it was a good movie,but after the second,third.....I was impressed:No overwhelmed by it.This movie truly has everything. A great story,beautiful settings,superb acting overall,brilliant directing,a haunting and unforgettable score,legendary characters,first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work.Every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of ""Taxi Driver"".<br/><br/>The movie is about a guy who lives in New York in the seventies.But he's not normal.Although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages.Here we are introduced to Travis Bickle,played by a brilliant Robert De Niro.The dispatcher takes a look at Bickle's credentials and notices that he's a Vietnam veteran.This moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on Bickle's experiences in Vietnam.It is the ultimate decline of an American guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic. The entire movie is based on this one ""confession"" if you will.In two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man.<br/><br/>Bickle accepts the job as a night Taxi Driver,with cab number 3596 hence my user name,since he can't sleep(all because of the war).In the scenes that follow we observe Bickle as he goes crazy,all caused by his experiences in Vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city,depicted as a hell on earth.Travis is disgussed by what he sees:""One day, a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets."" But then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel,in the shape of a woman called Betsy (played by Cybill Shepherd).He is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie.She doesn't understand him or his problems.This is the moment that Travis slowly but surely freaks out,he wants to kill the senator/presidential candidate just because Betsy works for him. But he doesn't go through with it.The ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker Iris (A very young but convincing Jodie Foster).He already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her,she is the physical shape of hope in the world.In one moment of rage and lunacy Travis kills her pimp Sport (played by Harvey Keitel) and some other people.This scene is not only the highpoint of Travis' decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie.Iris is saved from the clutches of evil and Travis has become a hero.What follows is a coda that is,in my view,the only weak point of the movie since it isn't really necessary.But it is acceptable as a closer.In my demonic mind I would have rather had it that Travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people.But maybe I'm too pessimistic!<br/><br/>For this kind of story no place is better like New York in the 1970's.Although I was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time I can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade.Other brilliant movies set in New York during the 1970's are:""The French Connection""(1971),""Death Wish""(1974) and ""Midnight Cowboy""(1969).Sure,""Midnight Cowboy"" isn't from the 1970's but it really exhales the sad realism of New York at that time.I must say that not each movie made in that time about New York depict a desperate view of the city.Especially films by Woody Allen like ""Annie Hall""(1977) and ""Manhattan""(1979) show a more fairy tale look of the city.I must say that,although fairy tales a not true,I really like these movies also. I've been to New York in the summer of 2002 and I went back a year later (just because I really love the city).Nothing from the view of the 1970's has remained,Time Square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of Disney and tourism.I must say,I'm not really sure which version is my favorite.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970's.Never was there any better decade in cinema history.Besides the fact that the 1970's will always be remembered as the starting point of the Blockbuster with ""Jaws""(1975),it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever.Martin Scorsese being the best of the bunch!<br/><br/>The acting in ""Taxi Driver"" is really first class.Besides the legendary role by Robert De Niro there are great supporting roles by Jodie Foster,Peter Boyle (most famous for his role as the monster in ""Young Frankenstein""(1974) by Mel Brooks and his role as the detective in Schrader's (yes the same as the writer of ""Taxi Driver"") movie ""Hardcore""(1979),Cybill Shepherd,Victor Argo,two cameos by Martin Scorsese (one is hard to see,the other hard not to) and there is a great performance from my favorite actor Harvey Keitel as Iris' pimp.It is a shame that Keitel didn't get a bigger role as he had in Scorsese's breakthrough movie ""Mean Streets""(1973).Still,it is an essential character in the movie.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail.Each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery.He really lives up as being the greatest director of them all.Together with the underestimated ""Casino""(1995) this is his finest achievement.Scorsese's uncompromising criticism of the war in Vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in ""taxi Driver"".He already had given his view in his classic short ""The Big Shave""(1967).But now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in American history.And then to think that there isn't a second of film in Vietnam in the movie.<br/><br/>The score is provided by Hitchcock protege Bernard Herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra.Together with ""Vertigo""(1958) and ""Psycho""(1960) this is his best score.The main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better.It almost has the sound of a horror score,it is that haunting.<br/><br/>Each character is extremely well worked out.Travis Bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while Iris is the embodiment of hope.Betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world. It is therefore impossible to hate Travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book.The finest examples are:""You talking' to me? You talking' to me? You talking' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking' to? You talking' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who do you think you're talking to? Oh yeah? Huh? OK."" and:""Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man."" The dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost.All the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war.The ""You Talking' to Me?"" scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain't the best.<br/><br/>The best scene to me is the final massacre scene.Not only is it the scene in which Travis completes his journey into lunacy,but it is a beautiful sequence to look at.The camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye,Michael Chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie (he would cooperate with Scorsese again on ""Raging Bull""(1980).To me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after Travis has done his killing.The camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived. It truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the Odessa stair sequence in ""Bronenosets Potyomkin""(1925) and the stargate sequence in ""2001:A Space Odyssey""(1968).<br/><br/>Finally there are a few things to mention:Steven Spielberg has actually cooperated on this film,he's the supervising editor.Yet another addition to the already monumental status of ""Taxi Driver"".There is a funny sequence in a porn theater where Travis goes in to see a movie,the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there! What a way to to fool the rating commission. Scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years later:""Bringing out the Dead""(1999).Although it doesn't have the power of ""Taxi Driver"" it isn't a bad movie,not at all.It was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but I really enjoyed it.It is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit.<br/><br/>A definite masterpiece,one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan. 10/10"

If you add that to a completely mind-blowing screen play by Paul Schrader you got yourself a movie that you cannot forget about when you leave the theater.  Robert DeNiro IS Travis Bickle, a veteran who lives what many consider to be a greatly disturbing life, but it seems very normal to him.  And, of course, how could you possibly forget the line, one of the most famous lines of all time ""Are you talking to me""  I can relate to that part and I think that most other people can to.

","""Taxi Driver"". Will the cinema ever experience another year like 1976? My goodness think about the five Best Picture Oscar nominees: ""Rocky"", ""Network"", ""Bound for Glory"",""All the President's Men"", and of course Scorsese's disturbing ""Taxi Driver"". Robert De Niro (Oscar-nominated) is an ex-Marine who has been through Vietnam and survived, but will he survive the mean streets of New York City? He is not sure and his thoughts make it apparent that he will destroy those who may be willing to destroy him before they get the chance. Things start to look up when he falls in love with the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, but he blows it and it appears that no matter what De Niro will always do something to keep himself alone. Friend and fellow driver Peter Boyle tries to show De Niro that things are not as bad as they appear, but fails in his attempt. Now De Niro's thoughts become more outrageous and he gets an idea to assassinate a presidential nominee that Shepherd is working for and looks to rescue a very young Jodie Foster (Oscar-nominated) from her sadistic pimp (Harvey Keitel). Everything will become more outlandish and in the end everything will come to an end, but in the end, is it really the end? The film is dark, ugly, unconventional, and out-of-this-world. Martin Scorsese proved that he was here to stay with this one and De Niro only re-affirmed his greatness after his Oscar win in 1974 for ""The Godfather, Part II"". The supporting cast is super and even Albert Brooks makes a lasting impression in a short appearance as Shepherd's co-worker. Paul Schrader's screenplay is super and overall the whole film is an amazing accomplishment that stands tall against the other great movies of the 1970s and every other decade for that matter. 5 stars out of 5."

"ArthvrPendrag0n","10","1","1","18 November 2019"," ""I got some bad ideas in my head""
","Taxi Driver is the kind of movie that totally blurs the line between fiction and reality; because it is built into realistic premises it is almost impossible to watch it without getting a familiar feeling from it. Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a lonely man in a big city; he's a war veteran suffering from insomnia. Becoming a cabbie was a way to pass the time. It's important to notice that he's a man that has no significant bonds with the surrounding society; actually, he loathes the society around him. As a taxi driver he's everywhere in the city, he's a part of it, but at the same time he seems to be stuck in his own world - he drives all kinds of people around, but he has ties with no one. Even the other cabbies are not really people he can count on, they're just part of the engine.Travis is stuck in a big city, nurturing some kind of revolt against it; he clearly despises the things he sees, with an emphasis on the many distinct social groups he observes during his shift - ""All the animals come out at night [...]. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this sc** off the streets"". It's interesting though that Travis seems to be aware that living a life apart from everything is not the ideal; despite his judgemental stance towards society, he also devotes himself to reflect upon his very existence as a part of it - ""All my life needed was a sense of direction, a sense of someplace to go. I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, but should become a person like other people"". However, he seems to lack the basic understanding of how social interactions work; that can be observed for the first time in his failed attempt to talk with the concession girl, a very inappropriate thing to considering he was about to watch a adult movie. Travis' habit of watching adult movies seems to be a plot device to show us how astray from common sense he was - considering attending to erotic movies is actually a taboo. When Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) is introduced in the story we see that almost instantly Travis develops some sort of obsession towards her; the idea he makes of her, in his head, seems to be enough to put her above everyone - ""She appeared like an angel out of this open sewer. Out of this filthy mass. She is alone: They cannot touch her"". He approaches her in a rather appropriate way at first; he's sincere about his intentions and she seems to be somewhat interested in the weird man asking her out. The initial rendezvous seems to be rather normal, but Betsy makes an almost prophetic remark about him - ""No, no. Just the part about the contradictions. You are that."" Later on, Travis takes Betsy to the same movie theater he usually goes to, to see the same type of movies he usually does - naturally she feels engrossed by it and leaves. Travis is unable to understand why she would be angry, why she would be disgusted, which only goes to show how of a dysfunctional human he is. Afterwards he keeps trying to approach her, but she keeps rejecting him; his infatuation towards her seems to turn into anger - ""I realize now how much she is like the others, so cold and distant. Many people are like that. They're like a union"" - some sort of anger that seems to be directed to society itself. Being rejected by the only person he seemed to value in the whole city, having no other people to count on, without a sense of direction, it's obvious his mental health would deteriorate even faster. Being alone is not something easy, especially when you're surrounded by people; Travis convinces himself that he is fated to be lonely - ""Loneliness has followed me all my life. The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks. There is no escape. I am God's lonely man"". Scorsese comments on how urban centers can be damaging to a person using a taxi driver, someone who has an ambivalent relationship with the city and its people, as a plot device. Society is a complex thing, and also oppressive - even when you're out of it, you're actually in and if you do not learn how to fit it will consume you. Scorsese doesn't try to portrait Travis as some sort of hero, in fact his disabilities are what really get highlited, he tried to portrait a sick person. Ultimately, Travis resorts to extreme actions just for the sake of being noticed by the world around him - ""Listen you screwheads: Here is a man who wouldn't take it any more, a man who stood up against the sc**m, the c***ts, the dogs, the filth. Here is..."". And in the end, when everything seems to get back to normal, society finally notices him - but ignores totally everything that served as a backup for what he's done. This movie will never really get old due to the realistic nature of the plot; 'tis highly relatable, but at the same time I personally view it as a warning. People can be time bombs and we never know when they'll blow. Theres a bit of Travis in each one of us and that's why we should be careful to not get bad ideas in our heads.<br/><br/>
I want to praise the amazing soundtrack by Bernard Herrmann; not only it is atmospheric it is also very memorable. The movie wouldn't feel the same without it. Sadly he died right after completing the recording sessions, but his soundtrack remains one of the best things I've ever heard in my life - and I think that is for many others."

The urban nightmare of alienation from which he can never wake is perfectly (therefore, repellently) captured by both director Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader, effectively complemented by Bernard Herrman's jazzy score fragmented by dissonant brass and shards of noise (the legendary composer's final work before his death). Culminates in a brutally violent ""avenging angel"" incident, but it's arguably even tougher to watch Bickle's uneasy and even humiliating interactions with those he tries to connect with; even the camera slides away at one point to focus on something, anything else. The cast is uniformly superb, including Foster's underage prostitute, Brooks in his first film role, and even Shepherd, who has limited range and versatility as an actress, but is well-suited for the material here; as for De Niro, he gives one of his finest performances (in a career full of great ones), frightening and tragic and mesmerizing, a mind and soul deteriorating right before our eyes.

Today is a friday, I'll go home, sit alone, and wait until I have to sleep, there is no point in doing anything, listening to music, watching a movie, or even playing games, the joy in doing it is just gone... tomorrow it starts all over again, God knows for how long. In Travis own words: ""loneliness has followed me my whole life everywhere"", so it's time to face it and try to overcome the bad sensation, when I managed to deal with this, I can start again.

"DVR_Brale","9","1","1","7 August 2019"," An insight into isolated deteriorating mind and your mind as well
","Here I explain what is behind TD's success as a psychological movie.<br/><br/>Even forty years after the initial release, Taxi Drivers is still a relevant movie from which we can learn important things. TD deals with far too serious subject to be easily forgotten or neglected. Conspicuously detailing effects of loneliness, Scorsese takes us right into a milieu and mind of a person who is suffering from chronic isolation left to his deteriorating mind.<br/><br/>So we're following a story of ex soldier, now a taxi driver working nights in New York. As he drives we see dirty streets revealed by too bright street lights with strange looking people on the sidewalks. Our driver, Travis, doesn't value this people highly; in fact, he is disgusted by everything on this streets. Every now and then we can hear him sharing his thoughts, as a narrator, a background voice, on different matters. This gives us valuable insight into his mode of thinking, current feelings and mental state. So here we have a double insight: one into Travis' mind, world of subjective; second into his everyday life, world of objective. This portrayal is done in a Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground style since this work influenced development of Travis character.<br/><br/>Here I shall emphasize what makes this movie special. This double insight, into subjective and objective, is presented very clearly. But it is the opposite with conclusions we can draw from this insights: we can not draw clear conclusions. Travis is not flagrantly troubled. Some of his comments and actions look pretty normal and sound. For example, he is pretty slick in approaching a girl. But on the other hand, especially towards the end, we are made sure his mental state is not a normal one. And there we have it: here we can experience from the first hand what it looks like to be manipulated by someone. Furthermore, we're even put in a position to feel bad for Travis! It's easy to think of him as a hero, as final scene reveals, and as a victim of society dissolved in debauchery.<br/><br/>Here we can see that Taxi Driver can be seen as a movie with a very specific ability: it can trick you into thinking that you're doing psychoanalysis only on Travis when in fact you're doing psychoanalysis on yourself as well! That's because you change your opinion about Travis constantly as he gets mad and thus natural question comes up: why is that? And here you're confronted with your own motives and standards.<br/><br/>So the careful watching of the movie can really serve as a kind of mirror in which you can see some Travis' traits in yourself. Pair this with prevailing theme of loneliness and isolation and you get a movie which can have a powerful impact on the audience.<br/><br/>Here the details of the movie and plot aren't that important because there's nothing solid to hold onto. You have to see this movie and focus on Travis, seeing how his behavior reflects his inner dynamics and hearing him read his diary. Further topics which are explored include the so called Madonna-w***e complex and superiority complex, as well as misfortunes of living in a big city. So to conclude, let me mention that photography and music strongly contribute to TD's ambient. Taken all together, TD really is a great, one of a kind movie."

The sound mixing felt particularly odd to me, but then again: could just be a sign of the time.<br/><br/>Other than that, the intense, edge-of-your-seat tension through multiple scenes left me very, very intrigued throughout the runtime.

"elicopperman","10","1","1","16 February 2019"," The Story of Loneliness Through the Perspective of an Isolated Man
","The 1970s was one of the most revolutionary decades in motion picture history. Because of the creative freedom given to filmmakers in Hollywood like never before, the world began to witness gems from the up and coming talents all around, such as Coppola, Spielberg, de Palma, Bogdanovich, Lucas, Friedkin and many more. One notable filmmaker who really made it big with a knock out psychological drama during this time was Martin Scorsese. Even though he had made other films before, Taxi Driver is the one flick that changed his career forever due to its worldwide acclaim from critics and audiences. To this day, it remains an incredibly fascinating insight on loneliness and isolation.<br/><br/>The main storyline revolves around a disturbed loner of a New York taxi driver named Travis Bickle, who roams around the violent streets while losing his general sight of reality. Upon meeting a campaign worker Betsy and a child prostitute named Iris, Travis becomes hellbent on saving the world his way, even if it means to take the controversial step. At its core, this film is a representation of how feeling isolated from the world can mess people up. Travis, especially being a Vietnam veteran, bases his inner negativity on the general bleak vibe of New York City itself, as it's a place filled with people who he just can't be with. In addition to the psychos and women who don't have much respect for him, there's also plenty of disgusting creeps and losers who somehow manage to approach women without much effort. It isn't until he discovers Iris and hears the plotting of a crazy New Yorker bent on killing his wife for cheating on him that Travis feels he has a reason to take down the sleaze bags in the corrupt city once and for all; a rebel is born out of his shell.<br/><br/>What's really interesting about Travis is how the film intentionally leaves out certain details about his overall character in order to present who he is now. There are many moments in the film, particularly at some of the political rallies, where he mostly looks around smiling strangely, yet they convey so much by showing an intriguingly chilling side to the guy worth questioning. Evocative characterization works best when a certain figure is shown to be who they are through emotional resonance, and Travis could be one of the most interesting characters worth dissecting through anyone's point of view. In addition, the acting is fantastic, especially with Robert De Niro giving the perfect contrast between Travis' softer side and psychopathic persona. Cybill Shepherd gives the most amount of humanity in Betsy, Albert Brooks creates the perfect amount of awkwardness in Tom, and a then young Jodie Foster comes off very genuine as a child under the influence who may have the brighter picture than Travis might regarding what could become of her, all with the right amount of spunk and pathos.<br/><br/>When it comes to technical aspects worth admiring, one notable scene that sticks out is where Travis is rejected by Betsy on the phone as the camera pans away to a hallway. Scorsese has stated that the purpose of this shot is to peer away from the pain inflicted on Travis at said moment. Even if we're not seeing the man himself, the context of the scene is enough to make one feel the same amount of suffering the guy is holding within. In contrast, the more gritty and violent scenes can get slowed down to display the horror Travis inflicts upon the criminals, making them appropriately shocking. The cinematography by Michael Chapman provides a good mixture of mundane daytime events and hauntingly grim nights in such a tumultuous city filled with crime and lowlives. Bernard Hermann's score also succeeds in creating subtle paranoia through his famously chilling scores that elevate the already grieve stricken emotions that plague both Travis and his outlook on where he lives.<br/><br/>Is there any reason not to call this a timeless masterpiece? Taxi Driver is, has and always will be remembered as one of the most psychologically traumatic films ever made, both in style and in substance. Two of the most recurring themes/tropes in many of Scorsese's films is modernized crime and conflict within crooks, so this film could be his crowning achievement in that department. I don't think I can say this is a must watch enough; it's a flick worth seeing at least once just to gain the experience from a ruined character. It may mess with you, but it will make you think long and hard about what you stand for, whether you're lonely or not."

","I don't like violent or depressing films, but even I could see greatness in Taxi Driver. For example, it wouldn't have been as great without the music, which gave it a very noir feeling at times, without beating the noir idea to death. And some of the 'atmospheric' shots, like the taxi driving through steam billowing out of a manhole, were really excellent - but only because the music was appropriate. And the final scene, where we view Betsy symbolically fading into the darkness, was pure noir ending to me. 'Maybe next time, Baby, if you're good.' But speaking of that scene, I was confused. When shot-up Travis was leaning back on the couch, I looked closely, wondering 'Is he dying, or isn't he?' And incidentally I wondered why the policeman didn't shoot Travis, since he was holding a gun, but then maybe policemen weren't quite as trigger-happy in those days. When the movie picked up after the excellent crime scene street view zoom-out, showing Travis talking to his buddies, I thought 'Hey, what's going on here? Isn't he dead?' And then when Betsy (Cybill Shepard) shows up, and she acts like maybe she regrets rejecting Travis, I'm thinking, wait a minute, this is seriously not likely! So then I had to Google 'What's with the ending to Taxi Driver?', and find that some think it's Travis's dying dream sequence, while Scorsese says it shows that people viewed Travis as a hero for shooting gangsters. To me that would be his way of emphasizing how screwed up things were. And supposedly the final bit where Travis reacts to something in his rear view mirror suggests that he may flip out again. So which is it? Dead, or alive? I'm pretty sure the answer is 'both'. I think Scorsese was hedging his bets, very cleverly (and incidentally leaving open the possibility of a sequel). First, Travis could have been dying after the shootout, but it wasn't clear - which I think was intentional. Those who feel Travis should die in the gun battle he started can believe the ending is a dream sequence (especially since it plays out like a dream sequence), while those who like the idea of instant justice can believe it's not. Sometimes ambiguity is just what you need."

","A wild movie that nearly 1000 people have reviewed so what can I offer? Nowadays taxis have made way for Ubers and Lyfts and the drivers definitely aren't helping people. In fact, we need a Travis Bickle for the Uber drivers!! OK, not the real ones, the ones posing as Uber drivers to take advantage of women.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) was an enigmatic character. He was very hard to pin down. Was he vigilante, was he anti-establishment, was he racist, was he suffering from PTSD, or was he just plain crazy? He could easily have been all of that but you were going to keep your eyes on him because you never knew what he was going to do."
"andrewroy-04316","7","1","1","22 August 2018"," A very good character study about loneliness in urban society
","Taxi Driver is a very technically well done movie that didn't quite rivet me at any point. De Niro and Schrader both do excellent work in this film, and the themes Scorsese plays with are very well done. Travis' struggles to fit in with society naturally are well developed, as we see him try to be friendly with several characters and remain alone and dissatisfied at each turn. The personification of the city of New York was very well done. My favorite element of the movie was the use of the music and lighting as cues to show Travis' gradual descent into madness and violence. That being said, I found the ending to be good but not great and that the movie just didn't quite connect with me. It was very interesting thematically to have Travis kill the pimps and be treated as a hero for it, and end up right back in the same place driving a taxi and struggling to interact appropriately with Betsy, even after he was declared a hero. The shooting and his ability to move normally and live through the shots to his neck and shoulder were unrealistic, and the climax just didn't feel like anything more than a violent scene, it held little emotional weight for me. I have the utmost respect for Taxi Driver as a technically well done movie and study in the loneliness of a specific character in relation to society, but it's not a movie that was relatable to me or had me feeling invested in the characters."

","Often considered a cornerstone of cinema Taxi Driver left me wanting more. Its not that the movie is bad but perhaps the reputation preceding the product killed it for me.

Martin Scorsese has crafted a moody drama film set in his native streets of New York and the cinematography is sublime. It makes you feel uneasy because you are on the level of Travis.

","Have you ever had that feeling where you're alone. You feel like your isolated from the world. You move into a big city and you feel scared. or maybe you're trying to escape something like a traumatizing experience. That is the main message of Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro)plays a Vietnam veteran who is suffering from insomnia. He moves to New York and decides to become a taxi driver. He feels like a loner due to him being a Midwestern and him entering a big city in unnerving to him. He develops an obsession with porno theaters and becomes disgusted by the world around him which is full of prostitutes, drug addicts and pimps. He tries to rescue an underage prostitute named Iris(Jodie Foster) from the world she's living on. Will he succeed or will he die a hero like in war?<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is the definitive term for a 70's sleaze movie. it's set in New York, it takes place mostly at night, involves violence, bloodshed and sex. You can sympathize with Travis about what's happening to him, he's an outcast who feels like he doesn't belong. The city is also perfectly done too. It's almost like Travis is living in a garbage can, where people discard the things they don't want.<br/><br/>To me, Robert De Niro is Travis Bickle. He's a guy who almost everyone can sympathize with. And you also understand his motivations too. Jodie Foster also does a really good job too. She can come across as an innocent girl but you're not sure if she likes what she does. The other supporting characters do a really good job too. Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle all provide good performances that add life and sanity to the movie.<br/><br/>But the main stars of this movie are director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader. Schrader has said multiple times that this was partially based off a true story and you can tell that the way he writes his dialogue can come close to home. Scorsese was a new director when this was released and this is one hell of a movie to have as one of your firsts. You can also tell that Scorsese adds some of his memories from when he lived in New York into parts of the movie.<br/><br/>What else can I say, Taxi Driver is not only one of the best movies to come out of the 70's, it's also one of the best movies ever made. It deals with a lot of things that people can relate too. Go see it. it's definitely worth your time."

"gab-14712","9","1","1","18 October 2017"," Martin Scorsese's Defining Movie!
","Taxi Driver is truly the movie where director Martin Scorsese really comes into his own. 1973's Mean Streets did not really connect with me as it did with other people and 1974's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore was a very entertaining road trip movie but it's not a classic. Now Taxi Driver is absolutely the definition of an instant classic. This film, about a loner with borderline homicidal tendencies, was well-received upon release and to this day, the movie holds up incredibly strong. There are many themes that can be applied to the film which we will get more into later, so this film is one of those rare ones that will challenge you to think; to make your own personal opinions about what is occurring on screen. Paul Schrader's screenplay is well-written and his words are easily brought onto screen with such effectiveness. Then again, I also think Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro helped bring those words to life.<br/><br/>So the film focuses basically on one main character. His name is Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) and you might recognize the name because how iconic this character is. Anyhow, Travis Bickle is a Vietnam War veteran suffering from bouts of insomnia. He spends his days in porn movie theaters and his nights driving a taxi around New York City. Essentially, Travis is a man who is socially inadequate and he often thinks about what is wrong with the world-particularly in New York. He generally despises people, but he has a soft spot for Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works for the office of Senator Charles Palantine, whom he later wants to assassinate. Also important to Travis is helping an eleven-year-old runaway prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) whom Travis wants to protect from her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>So who is Travis Bickle and what does he stand for? I ask this because this movie is all about him and it is effective it getting the audience to sympathize for this character despite possessing qualities of a bad human being. We are told he is a veteran from Vietnam and that he was psychologically affected from the experience overseas. His voice-over in the beginning of the film suggests very strong opinions about people of NYC. As he cruises down the city streets, he talks about the filth of the city. The pimps, the prostitutes, the robbers, etc. He mentions if he had his own way, he would clean up these streets. We also learn that Travis is a man with a quick temper and a violent edge to him. I loved how he pretended to know everything about the political candidate, Senator Palantine just so he can get the girl. My favorite scene (or one of my favorites) is when he drives the Senator himself in a taxi pretending he knows all about his campaign. And I wont do spoilers, but there is a certain connection between Palpatine and the mohawk on Travis's head.<br/><br/>This is a film that requires powerful performances if you want to make this a good movie. But with Scorsese at the helm, everyone performs amazingly. Of course, Robert De Niro did an astounding job in making Travis Bickle his own. He performed the character with ease, though this must have been tough on the actor. But I truly believed this character as a loner who is violent and has very strong beliefs. I loved the rapport he had with the young Jodie Foster. Foster began acting at such an early age, and you can see how skilled she is when she holds her own against De Niro and both have strong chemistry with each other. The rest of the cast is rounded by the likes of Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd (who is a joy to watch as Betsy).<br/><br/>I must say the cinematography and the score are standouts of the film. Michael Chapman filmed mostly at night and the picture has a gritty, real-time feel to it. The score was created by Bernard Herrmann, and this would be his last score before his passing. What a way to end a storied film career! His score yearns for the loneliness of Bickle's heart. The saxophone is synonymous with the empty shell that is Travis Bickle. It's a powerful, though often haunting score.<br/><br/>The film does not go without its controversies. The ending was deemed way too violent and Scorsese actually had to de-saturate the color to get an R rating. Though I believe it plays an essential role of the film, I agree the film (especially the ending) is very, very violent. Essentially, the end has Travis going on a murderous rampage against Sport so he could return young Iris to her family. The film is also home to a political assassination, which was set up very well. Though this is a characterization piece, expects lots of violence and blood. In fact, The attempted murderer of Ronald Reagan, John Hinckley Jr. based his assassination attempt off the events in this movie.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver, admittedly can be a hard film to watch. Though an iconic character, Travis Bickle is not a pleasant man. But one cannot help but root for him. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I found some interesting interpretations of this character. There are religious and social interpretations. He can be described as ""an avenging angel,"" and I can see that point very well. I loved how Scorsese kept the movie ending up to grabs. In other words, each person may have a different interpretation on what happens in the end. The film wouldn't have worked unless it got excellent acting and powerful directing. And that is what we get. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro pulled off a cinematic gem. Although you might get a little depressed watching at times. Don't say I did not warn you.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"christopher-underwood","10","1","1","19 September 2017"," sheer perfect cinema
","This is a stunningly good looking movie with the dialogue, almost seeming improvised, also of a very high order. The early shots, especially, the night scenes with neon reflected in puddles and viewed through the rear view mirror of the taxi, take the breath away. There is a beauty in the accumulated sleaze and it is ironic that DeNiro should speak of it with such disgust. But speak of it so well does he that we are caught between the two realities. That this seeming nobody could charm the sparkling Cybill Shepherd is at once unbelievable and believable. DeNiro plays these early scenes so well. I realise the writing is near perfect but even so it is stretching a point the ease with which his seduction proceeds and although we are on his side, we can barely believe our/his luck. As the film proceeds and we begin to realise just how mixed up or even psychotic the guy is we still cannot shake a liking for the character. All of this is helped enormously by the incredibly beautiful score by Bernard Herrmann and there are times when the visuals, the music and DeNiro's monologues combine to achieve sheer perfect cinema."
"RyanCShowers","Null","1","1","9 December 2013"," We're All Lonely
","Watching Taxi Driver made me realize everything I thought I knew about movies was wrong and I had much to learn about film. The truth of my initial viewing is Martin Scorsese's direction dropped me so far into Travis' mind and I never understood any of his actions as wrong. I didn't see him as a vigilante or even insane, I felt his struggles, loneliness, and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people. It was not until I read up on the film after the fact that it hit me, Taxi Driver is a diary of a mad man, not a ""hero's tale."" This led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me, lined in a sour sorrow that maybe I was crazy because I've been extremely lonely. Maybe everyone's crazy. Are we crazy because we're lonely?<br/><br/>We've all felt like that dead animal Travis focuses on as he watches TV, while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul. What Scorsese makes of Taxi Driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel, but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely: we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap. We try to reach out, but the people we want, do not want us back. There are people that accept us into their lives, even if we surround ourselves with them, we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want. This makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness.<br/><br/>Betsy represents who Travis wants unmutually and Iris is the woman he can literally have, but has no interest in possessing. Using his masculinity, Travis can't extract revenge on Betsy by killing the man she looks up to (the presidential candidate), so he kills the man of Iris he is able to murder (the pimp).<br/><br/>Taxi Driver show's Travis' loneliness in two specific acts in the finale: 1) the need to change the world's problems (with the shootout) and 2) wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself. After Travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save Iris, he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. The light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint Travis feels. Loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to. <br/><br/>Not only is it my opinion that I think this is Scorsese's best film, but I would guess this is one that's most personal to him. In particular with the placement of his cameos 1) by gazing at Betsy, he's acts as Travis 2.0, showing his fascination and love/lust for her. 2) the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs Travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence. The framing of Scorsese to DeNiro make the director like the ""devil"" on the side of Travis' shoulder, telling him to feed into his dark side.<br/><br/>Scorsese is aided by Robert DeNiro's portrayal, there's no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as Travis Bickle. One of the finest performances in cinema, he's a factor that made my first reaction so personal. DeNiro's finest scene is talking to The Wizard outside the coffeeshop. We understand Travis, we've been in his mind, we know what he wants to say, but he struggles to communicate when he tries.<br/><br/>The point of view of Taxi Driver is crucial to the brilliance of Scorsese's work. He puts us in Travis' mind and his feelings. To realize Travis's violent, criminal actions fed me food for thought: how do we know if we are like Travis? Inside our own minds, we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain. We have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds, even in Travis' head, we feel victimized by Betsy. However, if we look at the story from Betsy's point of view: Travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move. Can we *really* blame her? Perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people's perspectives, not only our own in everyday situations in real life. <br/><br/>During my most recent viewing, I took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness. The taxi itself boxes Travis in from everyone him, he's enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy. Taxi cabs are yellow, yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic, which gives Travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick. Travis sees New York as a filthy space with evil people. Scorsese makes us feel Travis is driving through Hell, with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab. The first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of Travis' eyes, full of confusion and fear of the unknown. The symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography, as well as creating new inspired camera shots.<br/><br/>""We are the people,"" is the slogan of Charles Palantine, it also becomes the tagline of the film. ""We are the people"" unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness. It impacts us all, even if the wave hits some of us harder than others. The last shot of Travis looking back into the rear-view mirror tells us that Travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring Betsy now that she desires him, but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface."

","Taxi Driver is an American drama directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Paul Schrader inspired from 1956 John Ford film 'The Searchers'. The screenplay is crafted so artistically by Paul showcasing a raw, nerve- wrecking and powerful look at depression and solitude. The film has the capability to become an altogether successful venture when the actor-director synergy can make astonishing wonders happen. De Niro and Scorsese happen to be one such example. The collaboration between these two has given us some of the really extravagant films. The movie starts with a Taxi moving in a slow motion as it leaves a foggy smoke behind as credit starts appearing in the cloud of smoke giving a more artistic feel to the beginning of the movie. Travis Bickle an ex-Marine officer suffering from chronic insomnia returns to Manhattan, New York after the Vietnam War. A person having no real life experience in flesh-and-blood human relationships gets alienated in the city of aflame and enthusiastic people. Travis takes up a job as a taxi driver on a night duty travelling around the city watching the night- life and prowlers that rule the streets of NY after nightfall. He is a person who tries to mimic the interactions he sees on the streets and goes horribly wrong, watches dirty movie in a porno theater, falls for a girl working in the Senator Palantine's campaign, takes her for a porn movie making her feel awkward and terribly angry. His small acts highlight his lack of human touch and his unstable mind. The director had pivoted the confused notions of the protagonist successfully as the audience was meant to assume him to be a psycho. Travis in the latter half of the movie, fails in repeated attempts to get his love back and finally makes up his mind to assassinate the Senator only to flaunt his prejudice. After a failed Palantine assassination, Travis freeds himself from frustration as he guns down three men who he holds responsible for corrupting a girl's youth in a brothel to rescue a 12 year old prostitute named Iris in an unsurpassed bloodbath. Scorsese proved himself a creative genius through Taxi driver. Only part remains undisclosed in movie is the reason Iris chose to run away from home only to become a prostitute at an age where she ought to be going to school, giving an uneasy feeling to the viewers. Like all the Scorsese directed films, redemption is the soul of the film. The audience, terrified and overwhelmed by urban crime will readily respond to any film about heroic vigilantism in future. Courtesy: Martin Scorsese. The review title pertaining to a stupidly cracked joke by Travis in the film, the drama is one of the most organized and a soulful drama made in the history of Hollywood."
"tupungato","8","1","1","20 November 2012"," Powerful but flawed
","To fairly review a movie from the 1970's, one must separate elements of that often ridiculed decade, such as fashion, hairstyles, technology, and jargon, from the story and the performances. S/he can't allow the plaid pants; broad-collared shirts; contrived sounding street talk; over-the-ears, less than natural, post-hippie era hair; or even the absence of I-pods and cell phones to keep him/her from directing his/her judgments only at the believability of the movie's plot and the acting.<br/><br/>So... keeping the popular culture of that time in perspective, I think Taxi Driver deserves high marks in part because it helped to make people aware that a soldier usually returns from war (Viet Nam or any other) troubled, not simply relieved that he is no longer experiencing horror and motivated to transfer his work ethic to the home front. The movie reveals, too, that a veteran may not have caring parents and friends and a comfortable home to ease his transition (though the difference between the memories of explosions and screams and the calm of an office or store creates its own special stress); he may have to find his way alone.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver succeeds, too, because of the acting. Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jody Foster, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel perform convincingly as the victims, degenerates, and survivors of a depraved New York City subculture. Only the FBI agents come across as a little typed.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver doesn't score high in all areas, however. While the cast impresses, this starkly realistic story actually lacks in realism. In the climatic scene When Travis (Robert De Niro) rescues Iris (Jody Foster), by gunning down the miscreants who exploit her, he has carried out a rehearsed plan (he had purchased several firearms) motivated by an overpowering and unrelated rage as much as he has valiantly acted on his concern for this once innocent girl. The writers, as they should, make Sport (Harvey Keitel) and his buddies look like low-lifes, but when these men rebound growling and screaming from 38-caliber pistol blasts from point blank range they behave like zombies, not humans. <br/><br/>During the outcome phase the less-than-likely events continue. Newspaper recognition of Travis Bickle's act seems plenty appropriate, but a police officer, FBI agent, or common citizen would have probably seen and commented on the similarity between the man in the newspaper photo and the mohawked character who drew attention to himself when he conspicuously fled the plaza where he had considered -- he pulled out a gun for many to see -- killing a senatorial candidate as he spoke to an audience of 500+.<br/><br/>And not long after the newspaper makes the public aware of Bickle's courageous deed, he receives a letter from Iris's parents thanking him for saving their daughter. Like the newspaper story aspects of the letter rate it low on the probability scale. I can understand that such a letter would include the parents' gratitude and feelings of indebtedness toward the person who made possible the girl's return home. I don't accept, though, that the parents would also tell of their daughter's successful readjustment to her school routine and renewal of friendships. After the abuse that Iris weathered and the violence that she witnessed, she would suffer post traumatic stress that would rival that of the Viet Nam veteran's."
"StevePulaski","10","1","1","3 April 2012"," Does for the people what he can't do for himself
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver bleeds with style and substance, and features Robert De Niro in, quite possibly, his best performance. He immerses himself in the role of Travis Bickle, an honorably discharged Vietnam Marine who is an extreme loner, basking in his sorrow, despair, and utterly melancholy woe. He gets a job as a night time cab driver that will hopefully control his insomnia, and maybe give him a purpose in life. He claims early on that while other cabbies refuse to pick up some people, like prostitutes and blacks, he doesn't care who you are. He'll get you where you want to be. If only he could do the same for himself.<br/><br/>Early on, Bickle falls in lust with a political campaign volunteer named Betsy (Shepherd), he has been closely watching, but not stalking. He sees Betsy is crying out for purpose and love, and doesn't feel comfortable behind a desk on the phone every day, supporting some politician who probably wouldn't do the same for her. On top of vaguely balancing a respectable relationship, near the end of the film, he tries to save Iris, played by a very young Jodie Foster, a teenager involved in explicit prostitution, treated like meat by her despicable pimp and the rest of society.<br/><br/>To me, Taxi Driver plays like an earlier version of the underrated Michael Douglas film Falling Down. Both films involve heartbroken loners, not only contemplating their purpose in society, but are also disgusted with the arrogance and mean-spirit that plagues the world. The blatant carelessness of the well being of other people. Both De Niro and Douglas give career worthy performances, but Douglas played more of a character going over the edge, while De Niro's character strives more on subtleties.<br/><br/>There has been a looming debate on the film to whether or not the character of Travis Bickle is good or evil. This debate can go on for hours, because the film provides enough evidence for both sides of the argument. One could say Travis is good because he eventually sees society as a corrupt, evil place that acts on impulse and favors arrogance over honesty, and decides to take action, and one could say that Travis is an evil character because he ignores countless instances in the world and commits crime by eliminating it. I believe he is a good protagonist, with some flaws, just like many human beings. Either way, he makes for a very interesting and intriguing character in a film.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the smaller additions that make the film into the work of art it is. For one, the writing, by Paul Schrader who would later work with Director Martin Scorsese on The Last Temptation of Christ and Raging Bull. Schrader's polished and commendable writing is not only sly on the themes, but definitely makes the film warrant multiple viewings. Just by seeing it once, I can tell it probably won't be my last. It seems Taxi Driver has layers that will gradually be peeled off one by one with each of the following viewings, and I can see this evolving into a film that seemed pretty upfront upon the first viewing but becoming more complex later on.<br/><br/>The cinematography is award-worthy. Who would've thought Scorsese's next step would be a black and white film? The colors are vibrant, as well as the atmosphere, being very seamy, expressive, but also very ominous and eerie, especially in the night shots. Some scenes even allow us to experience them in detail with classical music nicely placed in the background. Some actually take place in Bickle's cab as we cruise down the street and are met with shots of the sidewalks, evoking prostitutes, pimps, and street-walkers all with a sort of sympathy and vague understanding of their hardships. It seems Scorsese wanted to breed life into those that seem like they have none, and that's where the picture comes off as wonderful. At the time, we were rarely shown the lower-end of the food chain, and now, there is a film resting on that end, wishing it would be in a higher, more respectable position, but continues to find that wish elusive and imaginary.<br/><br/>Am I still coherently here, or have I lost you? Let's just end this way; Taxi Driver is a fantastic blend of urban isolation and alienation and is successful at providing humanistic characteristics to those who seemingly are void of any. The film is beautifully located even in its seamiest moments, elegantly written, and carefully directed, as Scorsese breaks new ground with this dark, very deep psychological thriller that may have you resorting to something happier afterwards. The man does it again.<br/><br/>Starring: Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."

","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is an overwhelming reality of violence, and remained as one of the darkest picture about the transformation of an innocent being due to the environment that he's in. Opening with a lot of smoke, the taxi looked like it was emerged from hell. Travis Bickle is the one that's driving that taxi, he lives alone in his messy apartment, he's an insomniac, he eats a lot of junk foods and sugar, and the only show he knows to watch is pornography. At nights, during Travis' working hours, we take a look at the saturated color of New York, the dirty streets filled with all kinds of scum in Travis Bickle's deep paranoid eyes. During the day, we see the hope in living at a place like this, until Travis was rejected again by the society that he declares like a union, cold and distant. Travis' downward spiral cannot be stop, each time he is going deeper into violence. Travis' confrontation with violence is beginning to be excessive, hearing the words at the backseat by some mad husband planning to kill his wife with a .44 magnum, and in the streets some mad man shouting ""I'll kill her, I'll kill her"" only deepens Travis' idea of the bloodbath in the brothel later. He asks some advice from a fellow cab driver, Wizard. But they ended up not understanding each other's point, this is a critical moment for Travis, he seeks for clarity but did not get it, he was saying ""I've got some real bad ideas in my head."" And that idea will come to life, as he buys his own .44 magnum and different kinds of pistols, he gets his first kill on a small store trying to save it from a robber. Scorsese effectively isolated Travis from the society in each distant shot. Not only that Travis Bickle was influenced by Norman Bates, in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but almost the whole film is Hitchcockian, from Scorsese's cameo, the homage on Rear Window in one scene and the frequent over the head shots. But at some point, Scorsese rises up from his master. In the second part of the film, Travis Bickle became John Wayne, trying to save a young prostitute from her pimp, a mirror plot from The Searchers. He acts again like a sane man, but he is slowly being dragged away from the reality. In the bloodbath, violence exploded, released from his captivity, he doesn't know what he is doing, but planned this thing obsessively and now that it happened, it is ironic that he was praised as a hero who rescues a young prostitute. The final scene as he drove Betsy into Manhattan, he seems like that he is back into sanity, but again he gave us a paranoid threatening look at the rear-view mirror, like the one he's been giving through the whole course of the film, and you know it might not be a happy ending after all. Bernard Herrmann's last score was truly a magnificent piece, it colored and shaped the image of Taxi Driver, haunting and unforgettable jazzy score. Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro all in premium shape and at their best in this agonizing dark masterpiece. Taxi Driver is so affecting because this story is all too real, Travis Bickle is not just a character in a movie, he is the character of the society, he is the voice-over of the isolated humanity, victimized by the system of the world."

","Is there an American film more wrongly and regularly misinterpreted than Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, Taxi Driver? Not even 2001: A Space Odyssey, by Stanley Kubrick, nor Apocalypse Now, by Francis Ford Coppola, have been intellectually, politically, and critically twisted and turned away from what they really are- and this all aside and apart from the silly debates over art influencing real world violence after John W. Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, due to his own obsession with actress Jodie Foster. The film has been deconstructed and reconstructed (see references to Death Wish and The Searchers) according to prevailing political and artistic whims more than several times, and matters have been further complicated by the many claims of the film's protagonists, from screenwriter Paul Schrader (is there a better example of a filmic one hit wonder?), to director Scorsese, to star Robert De Niro, the claims and counterclaims about the film have devolved into legendry.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost out to the formulaic boxer flick, Rocky, penned by Sylvester Stallone It did, however, win the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not only a great motion picture, but it is one of the best portraits of a character ever filmed, and Travis Bickle is one of the scariest characters in film history. Probably only Martin Landau's character, Judah Rosenthal, in Woody Allen's Crimes And Misdemeanors, is more truly horrifying (and certainly far more evil). But Bickle is every bit as scary, for he is far more unpredictable to those about him. Yes, he is not a cold blooded murderer, like Rosenthal, but he is certainly violent, and a racist- not of the KKK White Supremacist sort, but of the passive, scared little white boy sort; and much mileage has been gotten from the fact that the film's final shootout victims were all white, when in the original screenplay they had been all black (Scorsese and Schrader bowed to studio pressure to change that fact, because by not making a change, the beancounters claimed, the film might incite race riots, and lead to financial culpability). These elements are what make Bickle scary, and why he is so realistically portrayed. Yet, there is also the niggling truth even the film seems loath to admit, that Travis Bickle really and truly IS a hero, and not merely a crazed lunatic. Note that I wrote 'not merely,' for this is an important point: because most critics resort to binary thought in such matters, that does not change the fact that Bickle is a dangerous and paranoid man and a hero; and these are not mutually opposing claims. And by 'hero,' I mean it in the absolutely most sober sense of the word. Heroes are not perfect men, but they are real men (and women, of course). And heroes are not necessarily even ethically 'good' men (imagine that!). But they are brave, they are determined, and they are relentless, in the pursuit of the goals, things, and people, they deem as good. But, most of all they are 'real,' not like the fictive heroes that populate books and films, comic books and video games. And rarely has there ever been a more chillingly realistic portrayal of a hero in film than Travis Bickle. Now, do me the favor of not misinterpreting that, OK?"
"Chris_BS1212","10","1","1","25 April 2010"," Scorsese, Schrader, and De Niro combine to deliver a masterpiece
","In Taxi Driver Scorsese gives us a deep character study of a lonely man, ""God's lonely man"" if we're to believe our narrator Travis Bickle (De Niro). Travis is a Vietnam veteran who takes a job as a taxi driver at night in New York because he can't sleep. He cruises around New York looking for a fare and constantly finds himself drawn to the seediest parts of the city, despite his hatred of everything these places stand for and the people who live and make their living there. Right from the start we have an idea of where Travis is going from when his cab emerges from the white smoke of hellfire. Not literally of course but there is plenty of similar imagery throughout from the overhead view of the guns that the dealer lays out on the bed like a priest looking down at the altar to when Travis holds his clenched fist above the gas fire stove. Like all of Scorsese's greatest films Taxi Driver is imbued with ideas of religion and guilt.<br/><br/>There is little plot to this film but that is unimportant, real life has no plot. Taxi Driver is about character and the character of Travis Bickle is so frighteningly real that he is captivating throughout. This is a man who fails to connect with those around him on almost any level, his date with the beautiful, idyllic, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) goes disastrously wrong and there is even a lack of camaraderie between him and his fellow taxi drivers who are the closest thing he has to friends. And yet Scorsese makes him fascinating to watch, of course De Niro is great here and how he manages to get us to empathise with Travis is no small feat.<br/><br/>This is a film that I could watch again and again, and I surely will, it is a classic. The way Scorsese shoots the film, New York has never looked so gritty and Herrmann's accompanying score is fantastic, the only shame being that this was his final work. Films like this just do not get made any more."

Like mentioned from this writer's headline, a motion picture which is a Legend of it's own! Suprsingly, Scorsese won the Academy Award for Best Director 30 years after 'Taxi Driver' released. Now, that's injustice! De Niro didn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in here either? 'Taxi Driver' is a milestone, no praise can justify it's talent & respect.<br/><br/>This is a story of lonely man, 'be aware', it doesn't cater to any age group, it's for them who understand Cinema & understand the depth of 'Taxi Driver', this is not an entertainer, it's like a haunting tune.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction ""O My God', so so amazing. Paul Schrader's writing, flawless. Performances, De Niro is a legend, an astounding performance. Foster has been pretty since then, her performance, simply superb. Harvey Keitel, another fine performance.

","Taxi Driver is an overall boring movie. In most of its running time it's depressing, uninteresting and hard to follow. Still, I can see that it succeeds in doing what I think Scorsese wanted, to portray mental sickness. There is no doubt that he is a good director, and that a movie can be well done even without much entertainment value.<br/><br/>It must be said though that there was some interesting parts. The ending was good, and I think Foster did quite well as Iris. All the craziness of de Niro just made me depressed, but that's what made a great impression on me. Even though I just wanted to turn it off most of the time, the story about Travis depressed me so much that I just couldn't stop thinking about it for a long time. I couldn't sleep for many hours, just twisting my mind with thoughts of his miserable life. And that's the brilliant part. By showing us how hard life can be on someone, de Niro and Scorsese made a difference. Maybe some people got a different view on the ""scum"" of society by watching this movie, and that is an accomplishment. <br/><br/>All in all, even though I never wanna see it again, this is a good, but not great, movie. 7/10"

","Travis is a nowhere man, an angel with a clear conscience. He feels that the city is a very dirty place and could do with a thorough cleaning up, flushing all the thrash down the toilet. He feels nauseated and can't sleep at night. He wants to do what is right, he wants to do his part. He wants to help others that seem to carry the same impulse but are trapped victims of a modern age throwing its energy in the wrong directions. there is an echoing in this film that makes it clear that you are not the job you are employed to do. Here is a man who stands up and says 'NO' to all the bullshit. Here is......Here is a one man revolution crescendo. He feels he is on a mission. He feels that one must not dedicate his life to morbid self attention. A man waiting for a change, suddenly there is change, he makes it. Many will agree with me that this film is one tight masterpiece. Great chemistry between Director Martin Scorcese and actor Robert De Niro who after this film remained famous until now for his tough quote in the film ""You talking to me? Are You Talking to me?........"" Great script, great direction of photography, great cast and acting, great soundtrack, all very tightly fixed together. Superb direction! In my opinion this is definitely and almost undiscussably Scorcese's greatest of his greatest piece of work. I love how a secretary working in a voting office for a political candidate with another clerk parallels with the relationship between a sedated hooker and her pimps to say the least. This is the stuff that makes Travis feel all the more and more sick and he realizes it. He must do something, he sees these women as angels, good people like himself and he does not want the scum to touch them. As great as the crescendo is in this film, so is the dissolving, the relief at the end parallel to a fizz in his drink earlier in the film, a detail many fail to notice. Every detail has parallels in this film that are very necessary. However, whether you watch this film under a microscope like i did more than once or twice or simply at face value, as a film lover one would not fail to recognize even through its sheer feeling of suspense, that this is a great classic quality movie. Film making at its best. The ultimate cowboy movie. Very unconventional."

","To those who can't figure out the base of this movie; You need to pay attention to the ""deep story line"" as I call it.<br/><br/>Travis has a whole bunch of issues, and it seems like little time to solve them. <br/><br/>In my opinion his time in Vietnam is the culprit. Focus on that. He does his time,and with no time to collect his thoughts he's back in the U.S. and dumped at the 7-11. 99 per cent of the time this was the outcome for Vietnam Vets. One day war ,the next day 7-11. No de-briefing.<br/><br/>I believe this was Travis' problem.HE WAS STILL IN Vietnam. Think about it. It took the finally to correct him."

","Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese and legendary actor Robert DeNiro have made a hard, disturbing, isolating, gritty movie masterpiece. This is a fantastic piece of cinema.<br/><br/>DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam war veteran who has now become a taxi driver is a unstable, lonely man. As different series of events unfold he becomes more unstable and has the urge to lash out at a society that has gone down the sewer.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a superb piece of cinema. Every actor acts with passion so we believe them. In particular a young Jodie Foster stands out as child prostitute Iris, who is befriended by Travis. She delivers a great, heart-wrenching performance. We really feel for her character and all that she has gone through. Harvey Keitel does a great job as the PIMP Sonny. The audience doesn't like him one bit and that's thanks to Keitels great performance.<br/><br/>DeNiro delivers a truly great performance. Even though Travis is a lonely, violent, unstable cabbie we do feel sympathy for him and we almost cheer him on.<br/><br/>Scorsese has done a fabulous job of directing and the score by Bernard Herrmann is absolutely terrific. The dialogue is great and thought provoking and the cinematography is brilliant. The final scene at the brothel is very disturbing and violent but it's a scene that sticks with us and really is well done.<br/><br/>This was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar but sadly didn't win. This movie will go down in history as one of the greatest films made.<br/><br/>5/5."

","Comments written in 2005 on Taxi Driver will doubtless take into consideration things like De Niro winning an Oscar four years later with ""Raging Bull"", Scorsese still haven't had any luck with Oscar (he wasn't even nominated for Taxi Driver), Foster's rose to stardom, etc, etc. And yet, as one critic puts it, even today, the only thing about Taxi Driver that is out-of-date is the fashion.<br/><br/>My immediate association of Travis Bickle (the New York taxi driver immortalized by De Niro) is with Paul Kersey, played by Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"" (1974). But then, these two are in fact very different types of vigilante. Kersey's action is driven by a personal tragedy and it's very clear in his mind what he is doing. Bickle, as one critic puts it, is ""certifiably insane"". But then, he is also clear about what he is doing, but in a different way.<br/><br/>I can't remember who said that the mind of a mad man is just like the mind of a child (maybe nobody said it). When Bickle, after winning a favorable reaction from his blond goddess Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), blunders by taking her to a porn movie, his apology is as sincere as a 10-year-old boy's who has accidentally broken a neighbor's window with a baseball. This one layer of Bickle's mind, this innocence, is always there, even when it is subordinated to his absolute detestation of the ""scum"" of New York that finally drives him to become a psychotic. So much have been said about the urban alienation, the inability to relate etc, etc, of this character. The deepest impression in my mind from De Niro's portrayal, however, is his childlike innocence."
"tonymurphylee","Null","1","1","22 June 2005"," My favorite Martin Scorsese film.
","It is an intense allegory of a lonely and disturbed taxi driver. He drives around the city doing his job and hating it. This man does not have a good life or anything close to a good motive. Whether it be from his insomnia with the painful memories of the Vietnam war or just wanting to get out of his version of hell, the streets of New York, is irrelevant. One day, he meets a child prostitute and is so disturbed by her situation that he decides to use her as an opportunity to act out in violent and unusual ways. <br/><br/>When I watched picture I wondered if I was supposed to feel sorry for this man. I felt like I shouldn't have, but I did. He is so disturbed and so inhuman, but in his mind he is perfectly stable and strong. I love films that challenge me like this one did. Travis Bickle is not a good person. That's one of the things that is established almost right away. He is among one of the most insane and disturbed characters I've seen in a motion picture. However, unlike other films that would paint him in a negative and stereotypical light, Scorsese has the balls to force us into his mind and force us to see the world from his eyes. We recognize what state of mind he lives in and what he feels about this world he sees. It is very unpleasant, but it is a powerful and daring thing for Scorsese to do. <br/><br/>There are parts in this film that seem to say that hell is the only place that Travis could exist in, no matter what. He is incapable of existing outside of this realm of decadence and self-destruction. He searches for good things in his life and grabs hold of them so tightly that he forces them to become bad things in his life to suit his situation. <br/><br/>Eventually, the film comes to the conclusion that he should stop searching for good things to change his life, and start searching for bad things so that other people's lives can change. The film is hard to watch at some parts, not because of it's explicit violence, but because of the emotional pain that Travis goes through. <br/><br/>The hardest scene to watch is a part where Travis picks up a deranged passenger played by Martin Scorsese himself. A film like this is special when it can achieve those kind of emotions from a viewer. The emotional pain is a lot harder to watch than the extreme violence that occurs in this film.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the violence is easy to watch because it isn't at all. It is sickeningly abrasive and nightmarish, yet strangely enchanting. The blood looks very much like red paint, with a slightly light tone to it that makes it looks somewhat pretty when splattered on the wall.. It is all the more so in that the film forces us to view this and shoves our faces in it while trying it's best to spare us from the emotional pain. <br/><br/>This is one of Scorsese's finest and most complete films. It is a powerful and polarizing work of art. It is among one of the most emotional and suspenseful films I can say that I've seen and it's one that you'll definitely remember!"

","I just ended to see Taxi Driver, I just say that is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, is an excellent portraying of that filthy, unsocially, vicious and decreased part of New York, with characters that used to live there and that are creating mean business, that we don't want to see, not only there, but also in my city, in fact, some of the society is identical to the poor parts of Colombia, especially when the black threw thinks to Travis and the taxi. Very psychological and suspenseful, Taxi Driver is not only a film classic, is New York. The second movie I saw form Scorsese (The first only was Gangs of New York, also a classic for me), and the first when De Niro was starting his long-living career, and Jodie Foster as well: Their performances were accurate and also their situations and conflicts. For the other hand Chinatown, directed by Roman Polanski, starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, is the representative of film noir, descendant of The Maltese Falcon and Rebecca. Jake Gittes was that detective that is unhappy with the world, anyway, somehow, I saw that the screenplay was perfect: No mistake, creative and hard-boiling. Perhaps Robert Towne could be a writer for a lot of prizes. When I saw Faye Dunaway, I expected no less: She act like that femme fatale, but she doesn't begin as that, but she evolves into becoming a femme fatale, thanks of that father, daughter, sister and husband. The society of 1930s, portraying in Chinatown, was very perfect: It contains tha social life, tha customs and everything. ¡¡I expected less from that part, I deserved my surprise!! Corrupt politicians, infidel wives, lovers, criminals and anti-semitic. Perhaps many people, that already saw the movie, would say ""The romantic part was incomplete: It needed to be more influential inside"", or something like that, however I think different: The Film Noir contains un-sentimental love and promiscuity, and the part of love was that: It contained everything I read about the genre. Indeed Chinatown is another classic masterpiece, directed by another living legend: Roman Polanski Taxi Driver is film noir too. And is that society the one that expresses each one of the elements of film noir, and historical if we think about Vietnam War, speaking about Travis Bickle. For the other hand, it doesn't need too much for understand his mind: He hates his world, he feels he's better than anyone of them, and he thinks he is some think of hero, trying to save society form itself: He's totally insane. I recognize I'm not very specific with some elements of these two movies, but I prefer to bring you a synopsis about what you are about to find out rather than explain you the details. And i'm not a professional film critic anyway.<br/><br/>But I can say one critic: Academy Award should, at least, nominate this movie for more than just four Academy Award. ¡Screw them, for that and for ignoring Scorsese, especially with Raging Bull and Goodfellas! Remember the words for Mark Caldwell: They involve the AFI, but I would replace them for ""Oscars"": Thank you Scorsese. De Niro don't worry yourself about the AFI, their just a bunch of pompous elitist f**k's<br/><br/>When you go to videostore, look for these two movies, watch them and ask yourself: ¿Which one can be the Absolute Film Noir of 1970s? ¿Taxi Driver or Chinatown?"

","It is obvious from the opening scene, that this isn't you usual run of the mill film. A young Robert De Niro, driving around the streets of New York, scoping the streets for scum, with his harsh voice over, expressing his dismay and disgust at all the ""rubbish polluting the streets"", and with the piercing and disturbingly memorable score from Bernard Herrmann, make the opening few minutes of Taxi Driver memorable, and sets the mood perfectly for the next 105 minutes. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a deeply disturbed insomniac who finds some solace becoming a taxi driver. His already unstable nature is swayed from psychotic to calm during the course of the film. After his newly appointed job as a taxi driver, he witnesses the many harsh realties that plague his city of New York. Working five, sometimes six times a week, and only at nights, he truly sees what a pathetic halt the world has come to. Drug dealers, prostitutes, and pimps line the streets. In an heroic act that can only be admired, he takes a young prostitute under his wing and attempts to get her out of the apparent rut she seems to be stuck in. With a lot of money, but not much to live for, Bickle decides to ""clean"" the street of New York himself. The results is a violent lash-out, which can only be described and brutal and vicious.<br/><br/>This unsettling film, from director Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull 1980, Mean Streets 1973), is truly able to connect with its audience, and leaves them with a sour taste, as it should. In a director/actor relationship that is envied by many in the industry, the Scorsese/De Niro team once again bring realism to the screen, which touches upon a sensitive nerve in us all, as well as being visually appealing and dramatically intense. De Niro, gives a stellar performance, perhaps his second best effort to date in the Scorsese/de Niro partnership (the first being Jake Lamotta in Raging Bull). His portrayal of and unhinged Vietnam war veteran is played to precision, as the audience feel as though they are moving with him through his extreme moods. We see the sensitive guy who has fallen in love, the naive boy who takes his new girlfriend to see a porn film, and then we see the obvious anger and hatred towards the world, and the violent actions that follow. Scorsese direction is to be admired. Although he has denied it in many interviews, Scorsese has the ability to connect with his audience. But not in a way that Spielberg or Lucas would. Scorsese is able to put forth a realistic view on the world in which we live. The film is bleak in the point it tries to portray, and its dark settings and meticulously placed lighting creates a world that would really exists. Much like Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"", this film presents to the viewer a shocking reality that many people would prefer not to know about. It is this element however, that is evident throughout many of Scorsese films, and the reason as to why his films have such a huge effect on many people. <br/><br/>A brillaint film."
"SamuraiNixon","10","1","1","7 March 2004"," ""Loneliness has been following me my whole life."" -- Travis Bickle
","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is one of the great ineffable anti-heroes of the twentieth century. He is analogous to Joe Christmas of Light in August. They are characters of great loneliness, confusion, and angst. However, they would take opposite paths in life. Bickle is a mysterious figure who applies for a taxi position, because of his long bouts of insomnia. He is a former marine, honorably discharged, and is distrustful of blacks. The taxi is Bickle's vessel of loneliness. His interaction with humankind is the meager conversations with cabby clients and the small talk with other taxi-drivers. Most of his time spent is driving in the urban maze of the city during the night. This is Paul Schrader's version of Hell. <br/><br/>One of the key scenes in Taxi Driver is when Travis Bickle is talking to Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) on a payphone after a disastrous date and the camera pans to an empty hallway. It is as if Travis's pain is too much for us to watch. Scorsese said that this was one of the most important shots in the movie. The scene also represents many transitions for Bickle. Betsy represents a possible happiness for him. However, with Betsy breaking off the relationship, Bickle goes into a state of monomaniac insanity. He shifts his focus from Betsy to trying to save Iris (Jodie Foster), a teenage hooker. <br/><br/>The relationship between Bickle and Iris was influenced by John Ford's The Searchers where John Wayne searches for his niece whom is living with a tribe of Indians. When he finally finds her, she does not want to be saved. He saves her anyway. This is analogous to Iris who is hesitant to leaving or staying, but her destiny is not in her hands. She is under the guise of a pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel) who sports a quasi-Indian hairdo (Searchers allusion), has one red long fingernail (Lucifer allusion) and calls Bickle ""cowboy"" (Searchers allusion). He promises much for Iris, but will not let her leave. Bickle wants to help Iris, but she says that she does not need it. She can handle herself. Bickle will save her anyway.<br/><br/>
Palatine is Bickle's embodiment of evil. He is a hypocrite who will not clean up the filth, the scum of the streets. He is also the controller of Betsy. Bickle can see the lies and the evilness of Palatine, yet Betsy will spend countless hours trying to elect him and will not return Travis's telephone calls. After the failed assassination attempt on Palatine, Bickle then goes after Sport -- the scum of the streets and the controller of Iris.<br/><br/>
The chaotic bloodbath that follows is Bickle's catharsis and redemption. . ""Here is a man who would not take it anymore."" After he disposes of Sport and several other people, he sits down bleeding on a couch. The camera looks down and slowly scrolls away showing all the carnage. It is as if Bickle's spirit is floating away. What happens next really surprised me.<br/><br/>
The camera slowly scans several newspaper clippings. Apparently, Bickle went into a coma and eventually came out of it. He is considered a hero. Travis gets a letter from Iris's parents and they thank him for finding her. Later he picks up Betsy as a fare and she seems apologetic and asks how is he doing. Nothing more comes of that, because Travis lets her off at her stop and just smiles and takes off without even collecting a fare. It seems that everything right is now happening to Bickle. This cinematic masterpiece actually ends semi-happy. A twist I hope Hitchcock could have approved of.<br/><br/>
De Niro would receive an Academy nomination for best actor, but would lose to Peter Finch who would win posthumously for his performance in Network. Robert's performance is perfectly played. Before shooting for the role, De Niro actually got a taxi license and picked up passengers for several weeks. He borrowed the clothes from Paul Schrader. Many scenes are improvised including the famous ""You talking to me?"" which is one of the most famous cinematic lines along with Midnight Cowboy's ""Can't you see I'm walking here?!"". What I like most about this film, besides the great performances and the great musical score by Bernard Herrmann -- his last, is that it is like a Melville novel where there is allegory and the writing transcends a straight narrative. Many film critics have different interpretations for what the allegorical nature of this film is. Great films should be like that. Multiple viewing should be rewarded."

He feels more at home by himself with his thoughts and fantasies then socializing with people. <br/><br/>In the movie Travis has two relationships. One with a woman the other with a girl, both end up disastrous. The first with Besty, Sybill Shepherd, a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palintine, Lenoard Harris, and the second with Iris, Jody Foster, a 12 year old prostitute who turns tricks for and is looked after by her pimp Sport, Harvey Keitel. <br/><br/>Travis spots Besty at the Palintine campaign offices in midtown Manhattan while he's driving his cab and falls in love with her. Travis going so far as to volunteer to work for the Palintine campaign so he can be with her. After a while Travis gets friendly and close enough with Besty to take her out to the movies on a date with him. It turns out that Travis' limited knowledge of the entertainment world, the only movies that Travis watches and knows about are porno flicks, leaves him hurt and humiliated when Besty, shocked that Travis would take her to an X-rated theater, walks out on him.<br/><br/>Some time later Travis back on his job driving a cab one night in the East Village encounters Iris trying to run away from her pimp Sport when she jumps into his cab. Sport gets into the cab with Iris and after sweet talking Iris to come back with him gives Travis a twenty dollar bill for all the trouble that Iris caused and tells Travis to forget all about it. Travis soon becomes fixated with rescuing Iris from her life on the streets and from working for Sport for whom Travis begins to develop a very strong and violent dislike of.<br/><br/>As the movie slowly moves to it's bloody and explosive conclusion it's obvious that Travis has gone over the deep end. Arming himself to the teeth and getting himself into shape, both physically and mentally, for the battle against all those evil forces that are lurking around him that is sure to come. His frustration together with his ignorance and alienation of the real world has turned Travis, who was friendly and likable if just a bit odd at the beginning of the movie, into a Frankenstein monster. <br/><br/>The movie ""Taxi Driver"" is filled with academy award caliber acting imaginary and gritty big city photography and a multi-layer story that's easy to follow due to a very skillful job of directing. The movie also has one of the most haunting and memorable musical score that I've ever herd in any movie and it more then deserves all the accolades that it received over all these years. <br/><br/>The only bad thing that I can say about ""Taxi driver"" is that director Martin Scorsese made the movie too soon in his career. It's been 27 years since Scorsese made the movie ""Taxi Driver"" and since then, with all the films that he directed, he's never come close to making any movie as good as it and for all we know he never will. Like Orson Wells in 1941 when he made ""Citizen Kane"" that over forty years until his death in 1985 Wells could never do anything on film to top that movie and the only place that Wells could go after he made ""Citizen Kane"" was down."

","Revisited Taxi Driver last night after perhaps a decade away. It is still brilliant and fresh for those of us who recall the NYC it portrays. Read a lot of the reviews on the site and most people get it so there's no point repeating what has already been said. However, as it concerns the scoring of the picture, if you listen closely Bernard Herrmann has concluded the film with exact same chords as he did Psycho when he worked for Hitchcock (revealing perhaps his or the director's link to Norman Bates). Check it out! You don't have Psycho? Shame on you, go and get it then along with Taxi Driver you will have seen two of the most important American films of the last fifty years. p.s.

","""Taxi Driver"" is an amazing movie in every sense.  Beautifully directed, scripted, and acted, it is one of the most outstanding pieces of cinema created in the 20th century.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Travis Bickle, a lonely, disturbed man totally out of step with society.  He takes a job as a cab driver because he can't sleep at night.  He goes through several different events that have an impact on the story.  First, he meets Betsy (Cybil Shepherd), a campaign worker for Senator Palentine, a man running for president.  His relationship fails with Betsy, and he moves on.  He then meets a young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster), which leads to the bulk of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I have deliberately left out many important plot points, because the movie should be viewed for itself.  The themes and characters of the movie are among the most well developed and complex in any movie ever filmed.  The beauty of the film is in Schrader, Scorsese, and De Niro's ability to present a character so off the wall, so despicable, and so unique, but yet one that we can all relate to in some ways.  There is a little bit of Travis Bickle in every one of us.<br/><br/>How so?  Travis is ""God's lonely man"".  He sees himself as being different from everybody.  He describes them as ""cold and distant"".  He doesn't approach it in a hostile way, rather going about his business, blending in as a nice, charming man.  But, the loneliness is there.<br/><br/>This theme of loneliness is central, but so is the theme of redemption. Travis needs to do something big.  He doesn't know what, but he has to do it.  However, as he attempts to do it, he slips up, several times, because of his inability to connect with the real world.<br/><br/>Everybody has felt this way, some of us more than others.  We've all felt out of step with society, in need of some form of redemption, if not on the scale that Travis Bickle has.  De Niro's flawless performance, in my opinion as good as or better than that in ""Raging Bull"", communicates this loneliness to the viewer.<br/><br/>Aside from the themes, the characters, and the performances, the movie is a technical masterpiece.  The lighting, camera angles, the editing - all are perfect.  Scorsese created a work that technically stands up to any film ever made.<br/><br/>Watch this movie.  If not because it is a cornerstone of modern cinema, a must see for any movie buff, then because it can present an emotional connection to the main character that few films have ever done before.  Many viewers will dislike it because it lacks a fast pace, a Hollywood storyline, or an action or explosions.  But, for those who can truly appreciate cinematic greatness in all of its glory, this movie must be seen to be believed."
"solitaryman2","10","1","1","8 February 2000"," The most important American movie of the last 50 years
","This is my favorite movie, absolutely. I never felt so near to a fictitious character before. Travis Bickle is simply the most charming character of movie history: he's not a hero, he's not intelligent nor good looking, nor tragic in the traditional sense of the term, yet no one before him has entered into possession of the screen with such power and naturalness. It's useless to quote particular scenes in a movie which from the beginning to the end carves its name on the rock of history, proclaiming itself as an absolute masterpiece and Robert De Niro as one of the greatest actors of all times, surely the best of the last 25 years. No other movie has pictured so pregnantly the loneliness of a man and of ""the man"", and no other movie has showed better what it means to be sensitive in a cold world of lies. In my opinion, the best American film of the last 50 years."

If he would have killed Senator Palatine, then he would have been scum. But since fate has him killing ""Scum"", pimps and whorehousemen, he becomes a hero. In the eyes of society.<br/><br/>So in the end we are left with the message of it is not why you kill, but who you kill.

Aside from watching Robert DeNiro in his first role, I thought there wasn't much to like in this movie --and I'm not just talking about the violence. The ""romance"" between DeNiro's character and Cybill Shepard's sleek young professional is improbable to the nth degree, and even a clueless shmuck like DeNiro wouldn't be stupid enough to take a high class girl to a porno film on his first date. I suppose the viewer is expected to infer the reasons for every other unexplained development in the movie: DeNiro's purchase of an arsenal of weapons larger than some U.S. units are equipped with in Iraq, his sudden urge to rescue Jodie Foster's child prostitute, the approach to the candidate for president (couldn't get close enough to kill him, I guess), the final scene driving Cybill Shepard's character in his taxi (a dream sequence while he's still in the hospital or after he's died?), the letter of thanks from the parents of the child prostitute (also a dream sequence? also after he's died?). Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn. As for the direction, if Scorcese hadn't done better work than this, he'd be an obscure footnote. I expected to like this movie a lot more than I did."

I also enjoyed Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and cute little Jodie Foster.<br/><br/>However, the acting carries almost all of the weight in this film and doesn't eradicate the many dissonances.<br/><br/>For example, the movie builds much on the ""filthiness"" and amorality of NYC. The state of the city is exaggerated so much, however, that it is difficult to relate to the characters being affected by it. Also, some of the characters' behaviors seem unrealistic for me.

After seeing the movie 4-5 times, I still have to admit, there are some scenes which I don't fully understand, but I can still somewhat appreciate them. Robert DeNiro's acting is superb, as is Cybill Shepherds, and Jodie Fosters. All of them play their respective character convincingly. All of the minor characters are also interesting; most of them are either a psycho, racist or just plain despicable, in some way or another. The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes, from being a nice, gentle guy, to being a gun-toting self-help psycho, is amazing. It's got some slow scenes, but overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes a psychological drama, or any hardcore DeNiro fan. 8/10."

That would be Robert DeNiro pointing his bloody finger at his head like a gun, after his brutal shoot out.  Then they camera follows a track to police cars and they should fade out.  We would have a had a dark, brutal film with an anti-hero. Then it goes on for a few more minutes, and Robert DeNiro has friends and is a hero to everyone.  It changes the whole tone of the movie, and I feel that Scorcese copped out at the end and softened up the movie.  It went from a masterpiece, to a decent movie.

"moonspinner55","7","6","16","27 March 2002"," We never learn much about Travis Bickle, yet the talent involved makes him a compelling figure
","""Taxi Driver"" begins so ominously (with blinking neon lights and rising street heat which seem like symbolisms for Hell itself) that people watching it for the first time automatically prepare themselves for a Masterpiece. Martin Scorsese's film is indeed quite good, but it's also flawed, murky and confusing, talky in the wrong places, and features such an over-hyped performance by young Jodie Foster as a pre-teen prostitute that I imagine most viewers will be let down by what amounts to an extremely minor role. Robert De Niro's work is the centerpiece of the picture, playing haunted New York City cabbie Travis Bickle, a man so consumed by the evil on the streets that he eventually stoops to its level. Bickle is a human time bomb; he's ready to explode, and it wouldn't matter where he was or what he was doing. The movie doesn't make any apologies for Bickle, but I didn't buy some of the reasons for his actions (it's briefly alluded to that Travis wants to ""save"" Foster from her sordid existence, but one gets the feeling he just wants to shoot at somebody...anybody). I've seen better movies about people-as-targets, the City As Hell and urban alienation, but I think the reason why so many people remember ""Taxi Driver"" and keep returning to it is Scorsese's style. The filmmaker has an unflinching, fearless ability to take on the most neurotic of outcasts while wedging his camera into the most provocative or squalid of surroundings. His picture moves at a staccato rhythm--and it has too much chatter--yet the seamy, sticky ambiance is so tangible you can practically feel it on your fingertips. Cybill Shepherd does excellent work as a beautiful woman stumping for a senator's presidential bid who comes into contact with Bickle; Harvey Keitel is oddly-placed but compelling as a smug, self-assured pimp; and Oscar-nominated Foster, while just a bit self-conscious, does well with a sketchy role. De Niro, who was also nominated for an Oscar, is so adept at these kind of misfit characterizations that we're ready to fill in the blanks left behind by screenwriter Paul Schrader. We don't really learn much about Travis Bickle--deliberately, one assumes--yet De Niro and Scorsese draw us into his dark world. It's a fascinating portrait. *** from ****"

","This movie is slow. Everything about it is slow. The scenes are long and dragged out. Characters repeatedly pause and have little characteristics and habits that make them stand out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the slow pace kills any tension I would have had. And those traits were annoying me throughout, getting most of my attention, instead of the plot.<br/><br/>Rest assured though, I wasn't in any harm of missing the meaning of this film because I missed out on the plot: it seemed to be missing as well.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro stars as Travis Bickle, a marine who was discharged and now wants to work long hours. He gets to, driving a taxi, and he's real happy about it, the long hours that is.<br/><br/>He actually hates driving a taxi, because, though he says he'll go anywhere and take anyone to anywhere, in doing so, it's opened his eyes to the 'scum' on the streets. He's real upset about that.<br/><br/>He meets this girl, Betsy (Cybill Sheperd), who he suddenly feels the need to stalk, until he decides her manager for the campaign she's working to promote (for Palantine) is 'bad' for her. Then he decides he needs to intervene, by telling her how beautiful she is. She's convinced he's sane and nice, and goes out with him. After a few days, he ends up taking her to an X-rated film, because those are the movies he goes to. She storms out of the theater, and doesn't give him any chance to explain. That annoyed me, because she was acting all high and mighty. But I can't be angry at her, because Travis was being the real idiot, ""I didn't know you didn't like these kinds of films. If I knew you didn't, I would have taken you somewhere else."" Nice job.<br/><br/>Next DeNiro meets Iris. He wants to help her get off the street, because she's too young to be in her line of 'business.' DeNiro decides she should be at home, and in school. Of course he's right, and it's upsetting that she disagrees. It's almost cool that he decides he needs to help her out.<br/><br/>So then DeNiro buys a lot of guns from this guy who claims every gun he has is a ""really nice gun."" DeNiro should have killed that salesman and taken all the guns. But he didn't, because killing random people clearly isn't the point of this movie.<br/><br/>Next DeNiro practices being tough. Then he wants to kill the president. Then he wants Betsy back. Wait, those might be out of order.<br/><br/>The problem with Taxi Driver is the fact that Travis's character is so one-dimensional, yet people impose depth into him. He basically wants to save this girl from throwing her life away, then attempts to kill himself after he does it. He writes a would-be suicide letter, which was entirely pointless nonetheless, considering he lied all the way through it to his parents.<br/><br/>The whole deal with the president felt like some sub-plot idea that fell through but the director decided to keep it in there to lengthen the movie.<br/><br/>The most agonizing scene is clearly when DeNiro follows the Wiz out to his cab on that night and they end up telling each other, ""I don't know what you're saying"" and ""Maybe I don't know what I'm saying."" Thankfully, these two aren't the only ones who don't know what they're saying - the audience knows it, and hopefully someone tells Paul Shrader, the writer, that he clearly didn't know it either.<br/><br/>The effects of the shootout? Old and tired and boring.<br/><br/>The disturbing nature of the film? Missing, blame time.<br/><br/>This may have been great back in 1976 - but there are thousands of movies that have been released thus far, and a high number of them are more interesting, better paced, with a better script, and a more sound plot. From the reference list alone I can pull out several I recommend over Taxi Driver: True Romance, Natural Born Killers, Leon, Desperado, Collateral.<br/><br/>Let's not jump to conclusions and assume Taxi Driver is a bad film in any way. It certainly isn't - but it's done itself in over time. There's nothing left here that you can't get somewhere else, where it's done better."

I'll try to be concise this time.<br/><br/>No doubt the talent that went into this film, and ended up on screen, is enormous. Well written, well designed, well directed, well edited, well scored, well acted; dialogue crisp, rhythms strong, illusion complete. What could possibly be missing?<br/><br/>A lot, as it turns out. Imagine a series of diary entries written by the best prose stylist in the world, and imagine that this master stylist really believes in the thoughts he or she is expressing ... but that these thoughts are monotonous, trivial and of no concievable interest to anyone else. The world of Travis Bickle is well realised and we are completely drawn into it, but it's a world consisting of next to nothing. Travis is a narcissist. Nothing is real to him but himself and his own subjective impressions. That's all he sees and that's all we see. We get no sense of the world - the external world, that is - that this person inhabits (is New York really the jungle he sees it as being? who knows?); nor do we even get much sense of his psychology, his inner world. Just a series of subjective impressions. (The fact that the last ones are so ugly and violent, and unredeemed by any REASON for their being so ugly and violent, also detracts from the film.) It's done well, but one doesn't much care whether it's done at all.<br/><br/>I'm not saying anything positive against ""Taxi Driver"", you understand. A superbly crafted film is still a superbly crafted film. But those who say that it's one of the greatest film of all time (or some such rash claim) simply don't understand what greatness consists of."

And the point is...? There are credibility gaps galore--when he first takes out Betsy he takes her to see a porno movie! No way is he so dumb that he's take a classy woman like her to that. He shoots four (I believe) guys dead to ""save"" Iris yet is never punished for the crime. And just why was he trying to save her? She didn't ask him. Why not just report it to the police? This deserves just one star but the acting of Keitel and especially De Niro and Foster adds some points. Only for those who enjoy wallowing in sick unpleasant situations and characters for no good reason for two hours."

","Beautiful violence. After Clockwork Orange I'd say this was a controversial movie, this movie hit headlines everywhere. So buckle your seat-belts and prepare for a disturbing, dark piece of art called Taxi Driver. Let's talk about the scene that caused a lot of drama, the scene where Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is at the Charles Palantine campaign and attempts to shoot the ""future president"" but the secret service man runs after him and doesn't catch him. Which inspired the shooting of Ronald Reagan, although the bullet barely missed him, hitting McCarthy instead (who sacrificed himself, with a bullet hitting him in the chest and one to the lung). The attempted assassination was done to impress Jodie Foster, the most talked about part of the movie is towards the end where Travis puts his bloody finger to his head and utters the famous lines, ""pew, pew, pew"". Does he survive? Yes, he was in a coma for a while and got back out well and recuperating. Does he get arrested? No, because he basically just murdered a bunch of criminals/pimps (being a pimp against the law). It's a timeless classic and just gets better with every viewing. Grade: A+"

","The tension between the writer, director and lead actor is what drives a movie. The director usually wins that battle, unless the actor is highly intelligent (like Guy Pearce) or a superstar (like Tom Cruise). It's very rare for the writer to win that battle like he does here, but Paul Schrader is in the same room as John Sayles, Robert Towne, William Goldman - our finest movie writers.<br/><br/>At the time this movie was released, a 12 year old hooker was not something being portrayed in every Hollywood movie. Watching it again lately, you can see how thin Jodie's performance was. It's no fault of her own, she had been acting since a baby. She did the best she could.<br/><br/>The key to a movie that has the lead providing voice over narration, is that the entire movie must be something he personally witnesses. The scene with Harvey and Jodie dancing doesn't really fit into the narrative because Travis is not there in that scene. The movie - and the tension - only works if Travis is in the scene. The camera plays off Travis, and De Niro has to work his butt off to keep the attention on him. The tension in the movie works when this works.<br/><br/>I do believe he died in the ending shoot out. The camera hovering over everyone like an angel makes that perfectly clear. There's no other reason for Cybill to get into the cab at the very end after everything that happened to her with Travis."

","I was touched by this movie. A man like Bickle could easily exist and I think does exist in most of us. He came back from his service in Vietnam in his 20s. He comes back to dingy, decrepid streets littered with trash, prostitutes and drug dealers. He gets an honest long hours job of driving a cab. He tries to assimilate normally, but he is unnerved by the sinning and corruption going on. Politically that is too. He tries to create a relationship but he fails. Finally, Bickle being already mentally unstable and on the brink of doing something crazy meets the sweet 12 year old prostitute who wanted to get away from the sleazy life of crime. By this time Bickle is destined to rescue this girl and teach her that what she is doing is no good. So he does what he needed to do and kills the sleazy scumbags, and the girl thankfully got sent home. It's a shame Travis was suicidal, however, at least he took a few monsters with him. Great message in my opinion."

","The movie just didn't touch me at all.
I couldn't sympathize with the main character due lack of cause- What caused him to be the way he is. There are no flashbacks and almost no hints except he was in the marines and got an honorable discharge.
Beyond that, the description for the movie includes the young prostitute. The problem with her is that she just... Doesn't fit being in the description at all. While being foreshadowed and shown in the start, she only held meaning and importance in the end, when our main character found where to put all his anger and frustration at. At the ""company"" she was working at, all because his assassination failed miserably. 
Except of frustration and anger and mental stability, there wasn't much to our main character. He had the Hero Complex, he thought himself to be a hero like in the movies. He had anger that fueled the complex. 
Beyond that- What's to him? Who is he as a person, aside of the complex and anger? What does he like? What was his dreams, aspirations? 
He's not that much of a character.

","Taxi Driver is one of my favourite movies: it's Martin Scorsese's finest piece of work and this film further consolidated Robert De Niro's acting skills outside of The Godfather Part II; this guy didn't need an ensemble cast of gangsters in this movie to show that Travis Bickle is a truly traumatized war-vet attempting to fit in 1970s New York. De Niro is truly in a class of his own in this movie, which portrays loneliness in a way few movies can capture. It's a sad but excruciatingly well-done neo-noir thriller that gave us the big-screen career breakthrough of Jodie Foster, playing Iris, an under-age hooker.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is now over forty years old, and it's widely cited as one of the greatest movies of all time, and I absolutely understand why. This is a story that relates to outsiders: not just in the broad Western-country sense, but in a universal sense. Travis tries his best to fit in, but he's only really accepted when he's behind the wheel, transporting the city's filth. He tries to impress a girl and he just doesn't get what makes for acceptable means of social interaction (like taking his date to the porn theater). We see New York through Travis' eyes and it basically all washes over him until he bumps into Iris, and finds out about her 'job'. He won't have anymore of that so he decides to try and help her.<br/><br/>Need I say anymore about Taxi Driver? It's a neo-noir masterpiece that's managed to transcend space and time in the cinematic medium, comparable to other masterpieces in generations gone by like Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Star Wars, Back to the Future and Pulp Fiction. Taxi Driver is the equivalent of Holy Texts in cinema; it's that masterful and it's that good a watch.<br/><br/>If you're one of those film buffs that's missed out on this movie somehow, just give it a watch.

","In my opinion, this is the best film of all time. The cinematography was definitely of high quality. Also, this was the final soundtrack composer Bernard Herrmann made before he died. The jazzy soundtrack captures both Manhattan in the 70s and the growing loneliness of the main character, Travis Bickle. I've always loved the way the film is almost entirely centered around Bickle. It never focuses on a character unless they're with Bickle. Aside from the beginning of the scene at the campaign office, the film is all about his mental health. In the beginning, the viewer perceives Travis as an extremely lonely and somewhat socially awkward character. As the film progresses, these two character traits cause him distress and sadness. It is the two main traits he had in the beginning of the film when he was more sane that caused him to lose his mind. Bickle had trouble interacting with other people and maintaining healthy relationships with them. He didn't have any close family or friends to support him and for him to spend time with. Because he was constantly alone and being rejected by society, he spends his time either in his rundown apartment or driving his taxi in the sleazy streets of New York City in the 1970s. When Bickle ends up connecting with a teen prostitute who stepped into his car, the underlying hero in his character begins to show, but still in a subtle way. Late in the movie, it becomes quite clear to the viewer that Travis is going to attempt to save this young girls life. This shows that some good still remains in his character. His intentions, however, are still troubling because at the same time as selflessly helping a confused teenager get a better life, Bickle begins to further succumb to his insanity and makes plans to assassinate a senator who is running for president. When this proves to be unsuccessful, he focuses on helping the prostitute. Travis's mental health is seemingly very inconsistent at this point. Why would he want to help the girl? The reason he wanted to help her was the same reason he wanted to kill the senator. All his life, he had been rejected by the society surrounding him. So, he figures if he could get any kind of national attention, positive or negative, people might finally stop completely disregarding him. Although the ending was left pretty ambiguous, we find out that he has in fact reached his goal of getting the public's attention. And instead of negative attention like he would've gotten had he killed the senator, he got positive attention. Overall, this is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. Every aspect of it is flawless. 10/10."

Bernard Herman's score for Taxi Driver is so deliciously haunting and descriptive that if it weren't so perfectly written and executed it would pop out of the film and take your attention away. Herman's character themes become such an integral part of their development that you don't realize how interwoven the score is to each portrayal until the film is finished and the music begins to linger in your memory - bringing with it the appropriate visual. Just as he did with the Alfred Hitchcock films he'd scored, Herman creates the iconic aural colorization that makes you wonder how the story could have ever existed without it."

Ultimately what I find different about the two movies is that 'Joker' is a lot more acknowledging to the fact that our protagonist is mentally ill and needs help. I also notice the complete difference in movie scores, while Joker's movie score delivers an award winning powerful score that heightens many of the movies scenes. Taxi Driver's score however is very repetitive and honestly boring. Most of the dialogue is delivered in an even duller way than the music. It's not till the last 40 minutes of the movie where something actually starts to happen. I wouldn't say Taxi Driver is a bad movie but just a little dull.

","One of the most renowned contemporary American filmmakers, with a fair amount of high-end films, is undoubtedly Martin Scorsese. From its beginnings in the sixties to the present time, it has dabbled in practically all film genres and at the same time generated work dumbbells with great actors, such as in this case, Robert De Niro with whom he has made a dozen films, including his most recent work ""The Irishman"" and since 2002 with Leonardo DiCaprio with whom he has also filmed several and very good movies.
""Taxi Driver"" 1976, continues with his critical description of his native New York that had begun in another great 1973 film ""Mean Streets"" showing without contemplation the degrading life in which part of its population operates. Supported by a script by Paul Schrader, of strict Calvinist training, which denotes the strong moralistic burden of the film, Scorsese through the vision of a taxi driver ""with studies here and there"" Travis Bickle, (travel vehicle) presents us the imperative need of the human being to be recognized, to be someone and even more important to find meaning in life.
Thus we enter the routine life and pathology of a lonely man, in an impersonal city full of garbage, crime and vices. ""I think somebody should just take this city and just ... flush it down the f----n 'toilet"".
Scorsese, plays the passenger in the taxi who notes his wife's infidelity, to personally underline the rot of his society. Travis, witness of all this and of his bewildering and traumatic personal experiences, and immersed in his great psychosis, decides to take action and do justice on his own. ""Listen you f-----s, you screw heads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore ...""
This film is key for countless reasons, in addition to positioning Scorsese as a 1st-level filmmaker, it consolidates Robert De Niro as a talented actor and drives the very successful career of Jodie Foster when playing a prostitute with only 12 years of age.
Both the Michael Chapman cinematography and the sometimes poignant and at other times relaxing music of Bernard Herrmann, added to the script of Paul Schrader and to the excellent interpretations of Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster make ""Taxi Driver"" a classic and current film from the end of the S XX.
Cast includes Cibyll Shepherd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks."

","SYNOPSIS:
Travis (Robert De Niro) is a nighttime taxi driver in New York City who little by little gets driven to the point of violence.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Maybe I watched the wrong film, but I don't see the draw with this one. I know it's a classic and possibly I'm the only one with this stance on this film, but I wouldn't just say the writing is okay, I would say the writing is bad. That's constructive criticism if I've ever heard it... All joking aside, I do believe this was poorly written, because of how much I didn't care for anybody in this film. I feel I should at least care about what the main character is feeling or doing, but I don't. The whole sequence of events with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) made no sense to me and I didn't believe any of it. I don't know if she was trying to get something out of him or if she was somehow actually attractive to this guy. Then Iris (Jodie Foster) was a really weird character that was confusing. The acting was fine. Not De Niros best, not Fosters best. The standout for me was the whole scene with Martin Scorsese. He had the best moment by far and in the scene I also really like De Niros subtlety in that scene as you slowly start to see the monster rise.<br/><br/>To close this out, maybe I watched the wrong film or maybe there's something the film was going for that I just wasn't picking up, but at the end of the day I was disappointed with this one. 4.2/10."

","Sound in this movie had a big roll in setting the mood of each scene. There was a lot of non diegetic monologue and music; the music provided the atmosphere while the monologue explained more about the plot. An example of this is at the end of the gunfight scene when loud dramatic music is playing while all of the blood, bodies, and guns are being shown to the audience.<br/><br/>The cinematography throughout the movie was jarring for the most part. The film mainly consisted of short clips, whether it was back to back dialogue or a casual drive in the taxi. An example of this is when Travis had his hand in his jacket during the end of the campaign rally. At that moment, it cut to a different angle of Travis pulling out the gun; then the camera turned around to the Secret Service members' reaction. A different perspective was used to show Travis changing his mind, then running away from the Secret Service members. Overall, making that one moment of the movie feels extremely fast-paced."

","The repressed desire of the taxi driver Travis in the film was the re-discovery of the film this time, which was the subject that I was most concerned about.<br/><br/>It is actually quite obvious in the film: the unsatisfied desire makes the atmosphere of the film appear dark and heavy most of the time. In the previous movie viewing impression, I think it was because of the emotional dispute between Travis and Betsy, which did not pay much attention. This time it was the opposite. In the scene where Travis was on duty at midnight for the first time, the picture switched back and forth between the close-up of his eyes and the street scene-the girls under the street lights-and I finally realized it. I probably guessed the emotions behind Travis' eyes. He cursed the prostitutes-hoping that the heavy rain could wash the garbage off the streets-but he had been watching the women, his eyes entangled in love and sex.<br/><br/>From the current point of view, of course, sex and love are two different things. Sex does not necessarily mean love, and love does not necessarily mean sexual happiness. They are not two in one. However, to Travis, he was obviously not aware of this at this time, but he had already noticed the contradiction of ""two in one"". His belief was broken when he took Betsy to an adult movie theater for a date. In fact, you can see that when walking out of the theater, Travis is quite puzzled about Betsy's resistance.<br/><br/>When it comes to the ending, the performance of politicians has always been quite satisfactory, so according to the ending in the original impression, I can't understand the director's arrangement for him to be assassinated: Is it just because Travis' emotions are not irritated? Is the pattern of the big director Martin Scorsese (Martin Scorsese) so small? It turned out that in the end, the assassination was unsuccessful, the politician did not die as a result, and Travis had alarmed the bodyguard before he even acted. The audience unavoidably smiled when Kennedy was assassinated.<br/><br/>The ending began to shift towards the end that was different from my impression; the end was reversed several times, which was unexpected."

","I have known this film for a long time, and I have not seen it. I do not know why the great works in the film history are all those depressing pieces. This time, it is not easy to divide them into several times.
Robert DE niro in the film is very thin, although a tired, but the real young, and very handsome, I really think so. His performance in the film is introverted, everyone will pile on the ambiguous smile, when a person, the face is expressionless.
Martin scorsese and Robert DE niro work together to create an image of the weary, the weary from the inside out.
Travis coming from the war, although young, she has experienced the vicissitudes of life, he is a man, driving a bright old cab ramble in the river, both white and black ghetto or what is shady area, he go through it all, so what happen maybe he want, good disturb his boring life, even if it is a bad thing, but what things didn't happen to him, so he began to find their own things to do.
He saw a woman, she was wearing a white coat, appeared in front of his mature grace, symbolizes the purity of never being polluted, he fell in love with her, even in the heart of parents also mentioned her, he ask her to have dinner, buy her she ever mentioned record, but they, after all, not a man of the world, so he make her office, was finally booted out.
Then she met another woman, and the first woman is the opposite, she was reduced to dust, pure and she did not come close, but young rebellious, unworldly. Instead of saving her the first time they met, he drove away, and because of that, he remembered him.
Then, for no apparent reason, he wanted to kill the President. He prepared everything meticulously, as if there was a blood feud with him, and every procedure was not neglected. When he appeared on the outskirts of the crowd with his new haircut, he finally externalized his weariness.
Travis, care about the process and the behavior of the to do a thing in itself, rather than the result of this matter, at the same time, he to the society at that time, although he is very dirty, very disappointed, but he shot the President's behavior is not disappointed at his record, want others to President candidate, so want to, just to think of Travis too radical, he was tired of everything, don't care who will run the country. So when he failed to assassinate him, he immediately gave up and went on to what he called a plan to free Ellis.
Before that he has met several times, and Ellis his righteousness is words to advise Ellis to stop working in the same, really is persuasive, but Ellis is not brought his affection, she also don't think what's wrong with the present life, she was immersed in a pimp false tender feelings sweet meaning, it's hard to imagine that Ellis will hold such a strong sense of justice. Perhaps Travis simply saw Ellis' makeover as another way to pass the time in his life.
He acted after the assassination of the President.
Just borrow one and kill them all. I've heard a saying before, the timid are afraid of the bold, and the bold are afraid of the desperate. Measured by this standard, Travis is undoubtedly the most terrible what kind of person, he doesn't care about being hit, the reason why he escape is before you want to hit all the others, so when all the gunfire stopped screaming only Ellis, Travis lifted the pistol, aimed at his chin, successive a few trigger, if there were bullets in the gun, Travis early die, but god don't let him get a bullet didn't give him the rest.
When the police arrived, Travis smiled as he watched them raise their bloody left hands to his temple and pull the trigger.
Maybe the world is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
Travis has experienced the cruelty of war, with the exhaustion of body and mind to leave the battlefield, the war only bring pain for him, but I did not bring any honor, when he USES the bloody and violent to defeat their spiritual emptiness and tired, when he put all the order and the moral principles behind, but fate and he opened a joke, let him be the hero of media coverage, won the appreciation of people, after all this, Travis, can not think how ridiculous.
After the injury healed, he was discharged from the hospital, his hair grew back, he started driving a taxi again, and his life was on the right track. Perhaps after this, Travis was completely relieved.
When he met the girl he had been attracted to, he looked at her in the rearview mirror. She was still very bright and attractive. Yes, seeing this movie, I couldn't help but doubt the credibility of the type printed on it every day.
He politely talked to her about her support for the President without looking any different, as if he had completely forgotten that he was about to assassinate him. He never tried to ask her out for dinner or a movie until he took her home, because he knew she had a good taste and would turn up her nose at the porn she liked.
She stood in front of the car bent over, hesitated, as if to say something, but the words, the absence of a completely different, how much?
As soon as the words were out of their mouths, they completely replied to each other, crossed off everything in the past, he smiled, said a goodbye, and drove away. Leave her behind, with a slightly wistful expression. This time, it's really goodbye.
I believe that Travis will never kill anyone again and will never fall in love with anyone again. He is just in front of his taxi driver and only has the relationship of money and interests with all people. He is not afraid of anything.
The streets of the night are flashing with colorful bright lights, to the world paint it does not have the color, like a cocktail, very rich, but not pure."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","0","0","20 April 2020"," An iconic, ageless film
","For me, Taxi Driver is one of those films that I absolutely love, yet find it hard to put into words just how much I appreciate it. It's a strange, dark, brooding film, with very little in the way of plot. As far as the narrative is concerned, it's a pretty straight-forward character study of one of the most interesting yet disturbing characters in the history of film- Travis Bickle, played amazingly by Robert De Niro, in what is perhaps his best performance of his career (actually, maybe second best- I think he's a tiny bit better in Raging Bull, another great Scorsese film).<br/><br/>Throughout the film, we see ex-Vietnam War veteran Travis Bickle attempt to settle into life in New York City. He gets a job, and makes an excruciatingly uncomfortable attempt at getting a girlfriend, but as time goes on, he finds himself more and more alienated from society, and all the while his mind is deteriorating because of his lack of sleep, his loneliness, and his probable internal traumas from fighting in Vietnam. In his delusional state, he comes to see himself as a hero who can clear New York of its crime rates and undesirable citizens, and in the final act he attempts to save an underage prostitute (played extremely well by a disturbingly young Jodie Foster) from the life she has fallen into. This leads to a grim, violent, surreal, yet somewhat inevitable climax which is completely unforgettable.<br/><br/>The style of this film is perfect in letting us feel the mental state Travis Bickle finds himself in. Scorcese pulls off the incredible feat of perfectly visualising Travis' dull, depressing, repetitive life without boring the audience. It's a visual masterpiece- you're not gonna find a whole lot of visual effects, and it's definitely not a traditional spectacle film by any stretch of the imagination, but there's just something so brilliantly hypnotic and surreal about how this movie's shot. Scorsese captures New York City in a way I've never seen in any other film, making it look sleazy, filthy, and unpleasant, and perhaps even going a short way to justifying why Travis feels so compelled to clean the city up.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Paul Schrader is just as good as the directing by Scorsese. He writes dialogue that sounds natural, yet is still quite stylised in some regards. I get the feeling that at least a few scenes in the film were improvised due to how natural the dialogue often sounded, and that may be a testament to how natural the actors while playing their characters. The film is brilliantly paced, as while it may feel somewhat slow at times, it's never boring, as there's always something to think about, or some beautifully realised shot to look at. The narration also works fantastically- narration in films often feels forced, but here it contributes beautifully to allowing the viewer to get an insight into Travis' disturbed mind.<br/><br/>That's perhaps the films greatest achievement- the way the film explores Travis Bickle as a character so well that we as an audience feel as though we know him by the film's end. De Niro is scarily convincing as an actor, Scorsese's personal, intrinsic shots often reflect what Travis is either thinking or feeling, and the narration feeds us Travis' inconsistent, delusional, and often disturbing thoughts on the world around him and the people who inhabit it. It's a character study through and through, and perhaps one of the best out there. It's a fairly confronting film, even by today's standards; (actually, maybe especially by today's standards- I don't believe this film could have ever been made in America in a decade that wasn't the 1970s, which was certainly the most radical, ""out-there"" decade in USA film history), and some are likely to be turned off because of this, as well as by the slow pacing the film exhibits. But I'd say you have to give the film a shot at least once in your life. It's a movie you have to commit yourself to, but once the film successfully absorbs you into its world and its characters, it becomes a fantastic experience.<br/><br/>The musical score, the acting, the writing, and the direction all add up to something that I'd describe as a masterpiece. Can I guarantee you'll feel the same way about this movie that I do? Definitely not, but you have to give it as least one viewing. It's a famous, iconic film for a reason, and, in my eyes, definitely one for the ages."

","I could never wrap my head around seeing Robert De Niro as a young man and how different of a role he played in Taxi Driver than his other films. This movie had it all, action, disturbance, suspense, and a whole lot of crazy. You could just imagine Alex from Clockwork Orange being friends with Travis in this film with the amount of insanity and how they stand by their stance on things 100%. The director, Martin Scorsese has helped direct and produce over 60 films and is known most for this film. It was honestly amazing seeing him work with Robert De Niro in possibly his last film ""The Irishman"". This film is a about a mentally unstable veteran taxi driver named Travis. Travis is fueled by the world around him from politics to prostitutes. He channels this anger through doing what he thinks is right for the world. This movie always keeps me on my toes and is a great rewatch. The movie ties its events very well together and portrays a great story to watch. My only issues with this film is on how the other actors never really left an impact on me. It was mostly centered around Robert De Niro but whenever anyone else came on screen they just didn't feel important. So close to a 10/10 but a perfect movie is hard to accomplish."

","""He is a Prophet and a Pusher. Partly true partly fiction, A walking contradiction""- These lines are the best to describe the character of Travis Bickle as played by Robert De Niro. Yes you guessed it right. Today we are going to review one of the masterpieces of 70's ( not THE MASTERPIECE of 70's ) directed by Martin Scorese - TAXI DRIVER. In one word , the blend of Schrader's script , Scorese's direction and De Niro's performance is both compelling and disconcerting.
STORY
Travis (played by Robert De Niro) is an ex-marine and Vietnam veteran , suffers from Insomnia and lives in isolation in New York City. His Insomnia makes him take a job as a night taxi driver , driving passengers around the city. He used to maintain a diary and often he used to watch pornographic films thinking that is the only type of films existing in this world. ( A note : This film should not be taken as a New York Film , it is not about a city but about the weathers of a man's soul ) Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy ( played by Cybill Shepherd ), a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he naively takes her to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the ""cold"" people he detests in the city. Rejected by beautiful political aide Betsy after a catastrophic date at one of the ubiquitous porn theatres, Travis becomes ambiguously obsessed with child prostitute Iris (played by Jodie Foster), abused by her pimp Sport (played by Harvey Keitel). The violent pressure inside his skull is made worse by listening to the psychotic fantasies of a creepy passenger, a cameo from Scorsese himself.
That evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel. Travis shoots Sport in the stomach, causing a shootout to start. He shoots Iris' Time Keeper in the hand, but Sport gets up and shoots him in the neck before Travis guns him down again. Then Iris' customer comes through the door from her room and shoots him in the arm and Travis kills him with the sleeve concealed gun. He is attacked by the Time Keeper again who he stabs through the hand and finally shoots dead before the crying Iris. As the police arrive, Travis attempts to commit suicide, but runs out of ammo. Travis' shootout is seen by the police and press as an attempt to rescue Iris from armed gangsters. He is not prosecuted, and is hailed as a local hero in the press.
He receives a letter from Iris' father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to Pittsburgh, where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror. Thus the film ends leaving us to a disturbing picture of social disarray.
CAST :
ROBERT DE NIRO was an excellent choice for the protagonist of the movie. He clearly proved that loneliness is the cancer that allows self destruction to reach its peak. His eyes clearly had an expression of disgust and an aim of removing from the streets of New York. Although he could have run his taxi throughout the cities he preferred to roam around in this nasty lanes of NewYork. His dialogues also had a special significance as his words perfectly fitted his character. There is a scene where he says ""you talking to me?"" Watch this scene and you will fall in love with the MAN. ( Comment down if you want a detailed character sketch of this character and how Todd Phillips got inspired from this movie to make JOKER-2019 ) here's Jodie Foster, chillingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to ""save.""
DO I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ?<br/><br/>YES. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU LOVE GOOD FILMS. THE FILM IS MUCH AHEAD OF ITS TIME AND IT PORTRAYS THE LIFE OF EVERY CITY. NO MATTER HOW CHARMING OR ATTRACTIVE YOUR CITY MIGHT LOOK LIKE BUT IT MOSTLY ENDS UP WITH THIS SHADY STREETS , DIRTY BUSINESS AND WHAT NOT. AS A COMMON MAN WE ALL THINK OF BURNING THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY TRAVIS. ALTHOUGH HE IS PORTRAYED AS A HERO AFTER THE END OF THE CLIMAX BUT THE FILM ENDS WHERE TRAVIS LOOKS AT THE CITY WITH HIS SIDE VIEW MIRROR WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION AS HE HAD BEFORE SHOWING THAT HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THIS CITY HAS REMAINED THE SAME. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS BRILLIANT. IT HAS CAPTURED THE 70s AMERICA LIKE NEVER BEFORE. YOU WILL NOT ONLY GET TO WATCH A BRILLIANT STORY BUT WILL ALSO WITNESS AN OLD STREETS OF AMERICA"

","In the beginning of the movie when Travis is walking along the street Travis fades out and then fades back in further down the street.
After this scene the movie uses a voice over of Travis talking about his hours as a taxi driver and what his typical nights were like driving around in his taxi.
You can tell that Travis is an alcoholic because throughout the film he has a drink that is in a paper bag which most will understand is alcohol.
When Travis walks into a shop where it starts off with a few men talking, Travis walks through a gate where he needs to get a ticket to get in and my eye caught the editing. I like how you here the the diegetic sound of the buzzer when he walks through then the movie does short cuts of ""stop"" and then cuts to the ticket that Travis takes. In this same scene the movie uses a few clips of POV. One time when he leaves the store and looks at Charlie T and then right after he leaves it is used again when Travis sees a man on the street.
The scene when Travis is at the shooting range the movie shows Travis shoot and then cuts to the target that he shot and then zooms in quickly to show where he shot on the target."

","People said that Joker is similar to this movie and I now see why they would think that. Doesn't make it any less enjoyable, of course. But back to Taxi Driver: we have Robert DeNiro portraying a man named Travis who isn't exactly... well. Probably because he's a veteran. Being in the war can mess you up. But he's also a bit of a creeper. And he lives in New York, a place he believes is filthy and full of scum (and it is). In the beginning, he decides to drive people in a taxi as a night job, which works because he can't sleep. The whole time you're watching him, you get the feeling something could happen at any moment, thanks to Scorsese's directing. And that's why I enjoyed it. The score is pretty good too. There isn't that much music, but when it's used, it really sets the mood for the scene it's in. And while this is one of DeNiro's first movies, he does a really good job. Sometimes his delivery is kinda awkward, but I think that should be expected from a guy like Travis. Everyone else is also pretty good. I had no idea Jodie Foster was in this movie until I did a double-take. And naturally, I loved her character. I would also say this movie says something. Like we never really know who could be a threat. Because nobody pays attention to the taxi driver. They're just harmless people that may be rude from time to time. But that's always the case. It is important to stay vigilant. You never know when someone might snap.<br/><br/>I think Taxi Driver deserves an 8.4/10 (Great)"

","""Taxi Driver"" is a story about an ex-Marine, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro)presumably a Viet Nam vet with problems in that he is an insomniac. He takes a job driving a taxi at night and goes to watch porn movies by day. He sees New York City as a cesspool of evil what with the prostitutes, drug addicts, pimps, johns et al roaming the streets at night.<br/><br/>One day Travis see a beautiful girl in a white dress and becomes obsessed with her. She turns out to be a campaign worker for Presidential hopeful Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). Her name is Betsy and co-worker Tom (Albert Brooks has an obvious interest in her as well. Travis gets up the nerve to confront her at her workplace and invite her out for a cup of coffee abd a piece of pie. All goes well and Travis asks her out to a movie.<br/><br/>Travis buys her a gift and takes her to a porn movie unaware that this will not appeal to Betsy. She becomes angry and storms out of the theater and never wants to see him again. Travis is distraught. He goes out and buys an arsenal of guns with an eventual plan to rid the streets of the smut he despises. He seeks advice from veteran fellow cabbie ""The Wizard"" (Peter Boyle) who advises him to sit tight and things will right themselves.<br/><br/>One night, a young hooker, Iris (Jodie Foster) climbs into his cab but is forcefully removed by her pimp Matthew aka ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel). Travis takes little notice of it at the time and goes about his business. Later, a passenger in his cab who wants to kill his wife's lover (Martin Scorsese) describes the damage a .44 Magnum will do to various parts of the body.<br/><br/>Travis again encounters the 12 year old Iris and feels that she should be out of the mess she's in. He ""hires"" Iris for some jollies but instead offers to help her return to her parents. Sport convinces her to stay. Travis snaps and formulates a plan to free Iris from her pimp's grasp.<br/><br/>Travis shaves his head into a ""Mohawk"" and arms himself to the teeth. First he seemingly stalks Palantine but is driven off bu his guards. Next Travis goes to Sport's house of ill repute and.................................................................................<br/><br/>Many were or are opposed to the subject matter of this film and its' graphic violence. It's well handled by Scorsese as he brings an unpleasant subject front and center. I had trouble though, with the ""happily ever after"" ending following the climactic carnage. It was probably done to appease the censors as the story could have ended with the violence.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro was just coming into his own as a major star having won an Oscar two years previous for ""The Godfather Part II"". He practically has to carry the whole film by himself and does so masterfully. Jodie Foster, a former child actor, who really was 12 years old at the time gives us a glimpse of her immense talent.<br/><br/>You talkin' to me, you talkin' to me."

We stay with him behind the wind shield as he glides into the jungle of prostitution, drugs and colorful neon-lit darkness. Great imagery illustrates his view onto the world...
his anger is unpredictable, the movie is not an absolute view - we follow an anti-hero closely (there's rarely a frame without our main character). Traumatized by his previous life (Vietnam war), he fights to find a place in the world surrounding him. He fails with Betty, he struggles to save the Prostitute Iris - his anger and sense of misplacement try to find a source he could aim it to... and finally he kills (and get's killed) in a final shoot-out in the bruffle where he found Iris, trying to save her from the pimp who (as Travis thinks)holds her back from happiness... and from him.
We dive in slowly into his word, his world get's disarranged piece by piece - and slowly we begin to see his true needs, desires and objectives. Great narration techniques right from the start!<br/><br/>I loved the visuality of the movie: deep red and green colors of the night jungle, pastel colors of brought daylight... many scenes littered with advertising, brands and the overall wave of post-war consumerism. The camera movements illustrated the story well, very well... it was easy to adjust to Travis state of mind and understand his struggles truly. Interesting how a film from the seventies depicts an era so well after so many years... objectively 'true' or not, it unveils the darker layers of society.<br/><br/>I rewatched it after seeing JOKER (2019) to unveil some hidden parallels - quite a few turned up (storytelling wise, visuality,...), but most of all this movie is a stand alone in-depth journey into madness, anger, violence ... and the desire to find closure, revenge ... and his place in a forsaken, disordered, struggling society.<br/><br/>Tragic life, tragic ending... a deep look into a troubled life - still relevant, still powerful... 40 years later.

","One of the most lauded and influential films in cinema history, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the highlights of the gritty realism that characterized American film during its peak in the 1970s. A near flawless panoramic view of one man's world and state of mind. Travis Bickle is an ex-marine who drives a cab in New York City. Soaking in the streets of the big city the sights and sounds of the great metropolis with its attendant hub of activity: noise, dirt, rude and bizarre individuals, violence, crime, he's equally dismayed and repulsed at the world around him. Disappointed in his personal life the harsh existence slowly gnaws in him as the ugliness of society gets into his head culminating in a series of events that lead to an end that's equal comedy, pathos and liberation. Robert De Niro perfectly embodies the lead character with his unhinged, wasted, weary, awkward, autistic-behaving simpleton personality who gradually takes the viewer into his steady descent into madness. The Big Apple is the perfect background to the dark and grimy flick mirroring its own decay and collapse at the time. Justly regarded as one of the most distinguished and important films ever made this is a prime example of art doing justice to life and one work of art that only gets better with time."

It's quite difficult writing a review to a picture that has been awarded all the plaudits (by critics world wide). The intensity of the whole piece, just rolls and builds with each manic scene. Bernard Herrmann is worthy of a huge mention. He delivered one of the most apt musical scores and drips seediness throughout.

","Taxi Driver just oozes good filmmaking. The cinematography feels fluid, accomplished through a carefully considered combination of great framing, camera angles, camera pans, and what seems to be a deliberately slow pacing. While these techniques are particularly effective in Act 1, because it allows viewers to get an intimate feel for the characters and the gritty atmosphere of 70's New York, however, in my opinion, it dulls Acts 2 and 3 quite noticeably. It is at these parts of the movie when my connection with the main character, Travis, weakened considerably. I feel the latter half of the movie could be improved if it moved just a bit quicker.<br/><br/>Besides the film techniques, the actors give great performances. De Niro is overflowing with charisma, and gives great to depth to the uneducated but perceptive Travis character. Cybill Shepherd is also very good here. The acting is emphasised by the way the shots are prolonged, which also helps to make the dialogue feel very realistic.<br/><br/>In general, Taxi Driver is a great watch if one wants to see Scorsese's filmmaking skills, De Niro's charismatic performance, and a quick view of New York back in the day."

","What can you say about ""Taxi Driver"" that hasn't been said already? It's phenomenal. I'm not a fan of Scorsese's other directorial efforts, really--nor am I a big DeNiro fan--but everything about this film is absolutely, unquestionably RIGHT. So many people seem to be confused when they watch this movie: they either root for Travis Bickle when he finally loses his marbles, or they feel that ""Taxi Driver"" tries to justify racism and misogyny. I don't think there's any need to go to such extremes. Yes, there are elements of racism and misogyny here, but the film doesn't promote those attitudes. And as for Travis being the nominal ""hero"" of the film, I don't believe that this was Paul Schrader's intention, either. There ARE no heroes; ultimately, this is just the very grim story of a marginalized man who loses what little control he had to begin with. This is why ""Taxi Driver"" appeals to people, I believe, but it's also why the film is routinely misinterpreted. As Schrader has said, this is a film about alienation. ""Taxi Driver"" tells an interesting, engaging human story and that's what makes it great--not the social commentary, or what's viewed as such."

","I cannot begin to explain how much I actually love this movie. It has stuck with me since I've watched it two months ago.<br/><br/>I watched this movie in 2018, 42 years after it was released. This movie stayed, stays and will stay topical. A story about a man drenched in loneliness, searching a meaning to live and who cannot bear to see the inequalities that show up in a big city as New York City. Travis Bickle, a war veteran of 26, depressed and feeling lonely in the world's biggest city. It's something I think everyone will experience at a certain time of their life, whether it'd be in their teens, in their twenties or whenever. Feeling lonely in a big city is maybe what connects everyone.<br/><br/>The movie is about Travis. Travis and his thoughts. A man alone with his thoughts, his view upon the city, upon life. He has shallow relationships with the other characters that play a part in his life and we see him struggle with that. He tries to play a part in everyone's life and tries to become a part of it but never succeeds. His sense of humour covers up his difficulties he has during these conversations and it seems Travis has floated away from society, like he is someone watching, not taking part in it. Travis feels helpless after noticing the things that have gone wrong in the world and goes mad. I think his plan to save Iris from prostitution is a way of trying to make things right, and in a way, seeking a reason to live - to give his life a meaning instead of driving around all night without giving a real contribution to society, to help it get better.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is an amazing work by Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader which will always be a great work, and I think it will age well, just like it did the last 42 years. It will continue to grab people and take a hold of them, changing their view on society. Everything about it feels right. The acting, the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere. It's a masterpiece, if you ask me."

She was able to make the audience feel pity for her.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie was well portrayed, it was slow and dismal. This feel was the result of showing the night traffic in New York City.

","'Taxi Driver (1976)' is an interesting, subversive and unflinching character-study, an amalgamation of genres that provides unexpectedly effecting results. You'd expect it to be a thriller, but it is actually more of a slow and methodical drama - despite all of its violence and otherwise seedy elements. As with most of Scorsese's work, the picture isn't interested in judging any of its characters or mindsets, no matter how deplorable they might be. Rather, it depicts its events with a candid honesty and asks us, the audience, to make up our own minds about them. This could sometimes be misconstrued as glamorisation, especially in its sequences involving guns and the 'cool' portrayal of 'masculinity' surrounding them, but I don't think this is the case. By portraying every scene in the same 'flat' way, the feature opens itself up to analysis, which is necessary on the part of every viewer - or at least those willing to think, and invites interpretation and critique, not of itself but of the choices of its characters. Speaking of characters, this features some of the most deplorable characters in any of Scorsese's work. These mostly arise in the latter movement of the piece, surrounding Jodie Foster's child prostitute character, and the moments including them are uncomfortable to say the least. As is the implication that more of them exist within the city, unseen but ready to crawl from beneath the surface or having just scuttled back down below. The feature is disturbing, especially in these harsher sequences, but it never crosses the line. It just maintains its method of being as candid as possible, portraying its seedy situations and asking us to do the judging for it. These moments don't make it hard to understand our protagonist's mindset that the city is filled with scum, though. Speaking of our protagonist, 'Travis Bickle' is easily one of the most unique and well-realised characters ever put to film. He certainly isn't a hero, he isn't even an anti-hero, but he also isn't a villain. He's just a man struggling, alone, to cope with his mental-illness and otherwise keep himself afloat. His deterioration from lonely and despondent to angry and disturbed, ultimately homicidal, is a compelling and engaging one. You like him and want him to be okay, but the events of the film weigh down on his already damaged psyche and turn his disillusion to all-out rage. The delusion that his violence could be motivated by pseudo altruism, a need to save - or 'clean' - his city, is one that only serves his need to justify his actions. He needs to act out his newfound impulses for no-one other than himself. Whether his first attempt fails due to extenuating circumstances as it appears or if it is due to his conscience is up for debate, as is if he wants to 'save' anyone at all. What isn't, is that he needs to act out his urges on someone, and he just so happens to do it on the right people. That's the only way he could ever be labelled a 'hero', and dangerously so. The 'downward spiral' arc isn't often done, though, and that, along with the fact it is done so deftly, is why it is so captivating to watch. The structure of the overall piece is unconventional, too, with a dream-like feel compounding its sort of 'aimed aimless' vibe. The performances and writing are excellent, both combining to make one of the most nuanced characters in film history. For me, this is the definitive Robert De Niro role. He should have won an Oscar for his work here. The two-handed score is phenomenal, as well. It combines flashes of our lead's possibly traumatic past with another character's certainly traumatic present, foreshadowing their fateful meeting. The direction is great, too, and serves to add to the effect that we are peeking into a man's life, a man who could be living next door. That makes the film quite scary. It's also sublime. A fantastic piece of work that's subversive, unconventional, uncomfortable and deeply effecting. 8/10"

","First off, the cinematography was great, Robert De Niro was great, and the plot was great. I was all just great! What I like most about the film is it's unique yet mundane plot. Well, Its base is in the mundane life of a New Yorker. It's uniqueness come from these very ""New York"" esque random occurrences. The things that happen in the film are very out-there but could easily happen to any taxi driver in NYC . Its New York! It's a crazy ass city and the film says that perfectly. 
Secondly, I appreciate how the romance wasn't predictable. Anyone accustomed to mainstream film would've expected Cybill Shephard's character to forgive and fall in love with De Niro's character, but she didn't. In a way, that IS what drove the plot. It's interesting because in most film, romance drives the plot, but in this case, a lack of romance is what keeps the story moving. 
I also appreciate how un-Hollywood De Niro's character is. He has the makings of a secondary character due to his odd, quiet, ""no-one-understands-me"" personality. I think it is cool that the main character has such un-likable characteristics. i.e when he stalks Betsy (Shepard) and tells her about herself (which is apparently attractive), or when he threatens to kill her after she stops returning his calls. He is simply a weird guy and I enjoyed that.
In terms of cinematography, I love the initial scene where there are a series of close ups of the taxi itself. I think that was a great choice and an interesting way of making the taxi feel like an actual, independent character. The building of the conflict and resolution were compelling as well. It's like the plot switches up on the De Niro as well as the audience. It's very clever.
At the end of the day, Taxi Driver is a cinematically gorgeous film that illustrates a life not yet seen or understood by the mainstream; a seriously lonely man turned hero in the weirdest, most New Yorker way."

For all those who never seen it, my advice would be to give it some time. ""Taxi Driver"" is not made for the impatient. It is NOT an action movie. It is a disturbing movie about a man's mental downfall. It is NOT fun to watch, brilliantly disturbing nonetheless.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese got ignored by the Oscars for decades on end. Though recently Scorsese got a standing ovation at the Oscars that lasted longer than any other because of the enormous gratitude and admiration amongst his collegue directors and actors. But way back in the seventies Martin Scorsere was a young and upcoming talent and ""Taxi Driver"" got ignored at the Oscars, although Robert de Niro did get a nomination, which he didnt win.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was only recognized for it's true significance by ALL the critics many years later. A lot of mixed reviews upon first release though. Some hailed it as a masterpiece (Cannes Jury Prize), others considered it utter garbage. Mostly the violence was mentioned as off putting by the critics. That's strange, because there is not a lot of violence in it, but when ""Taxi Driver"" had just been released in 1976 it got a bad rep for it's violence anyway. The (only very small part of) violence is purposeful and crucial to the story. It aint violence for the sake of it. The portrayed violence is the climax of a story about alienation in which the leading character sees no other solution for his problems then starting a killing spree. Lots of analyses about the reasons why this man turns to violence are on the tip of my tongue, but you better judge for your self why you think violence is portrayed the way that it is in this movie. Lots of different opinions here on Imdb.<br/><br/>Legendary movie composer Bernard Herrmann (famous from his Alfred Hitchock scores) who wrote the soundtrack is memorated at the endcredits, because he passed away after the making of ""Taxi Driver"". His soundtrack could truly be labeled as another leading role, because of the powerful impact it has got. The soundtrack mixes in with the voice over of Robert de Niro, who describes the filth of New York, while the jazzy tunes surround him during his nightshift as a taxidriver. This soundtrack is seductive and smooth at one time, yet pounding dark and eery sounding at other moments.<br/><br/>I think Herrmanns soundtrack together with the photography of another movie legend Michael Chapman gives us viewers one of the most impressive raunchy backdrops of New York City life ever recorded in the seventies. You can feel and smell the filth of the streets through their music and filming. Michael Chapman's use of the camera is extremely intuitive and acts as a fly on the wall, heightening the true to life depiction of Robert de Niro's alienation in New York City. Some of his shots are so extra ordinary and playful that they take me by surprise every time I see them. Just gorgeous alienating dreamlike shots that seem to float over the scene, instead of directly capturing it. You just gotta see it yourself, to experience the dark beauty of it. Because dark, yet beautiful it is!"

","Honestly, at first, by no means did I like the character, Travis, starred by Robert De Niro. His ignorance totally made him nothing but a hippie full of stupidity and embarrassment. Neither his dating with Betsy nor his habitual pause with that silly smile could I tolerate for any more in the scene, yet this proves that Robert De Niro did make a great job on the acting. HOWEVER, at the last scene when Travis leaving a cold and numb ""goodbye"" to Betsy without taking the fee for driving, I found Travis my favorite character in the film. Travis is a sarcastic admonishment for modern people who seemingly aren't ignorant, and makes this movie an art of sarcasm. Travis was credited as a hero for saving Iris from a prostitute because of his strong intolerance of ""the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit"", so he ""stood up"". Compared with Palantine, as a symbol of most modern people, all his actions remain watchwords, slogans, and in speeches. All we modern people care about is where the stress should be put in the sentence, ""We are the people"", leaving the true problem gradually turning an ignorant and innocent man into a mad one. Finally this madman committed a serious crime which is so called ""a hero act"" to modern people. See, how sarcastic is this? We all have madness to these problems, yet we hide it instead and presume on some guy like Travis to stand out. In my perspective, what Travis has done and become aren't hero things but nothing more than what a morbid society forces him to do. He brutally killed three men in a federal society and is crowned as a hero. See how mad this society is to the useless politicians. Taxi Driver and taxi drivers, these ignorant people, are both reminders for we modern people not to just maintain the situation but to reform and reinforce it."

","Taxi Driver - An insane Award winning film by director Martin Scorsese in 1976. Robert DeNiro is playing a mentally unstable and loneliness occupied taxi driver.

"DKosty123","8","0","0","4 January 2018"," Fine Film With A Great Cast & Story
","Besides the great Martin Scorsese directing thi film, and Paul Schrader (Raging Bull) writing the script, the cast is pretty much a who's who of stars and supporting actors in the 1970's and beyond. Jodie Foster, all of 14, had been acting since age 7, though this was her biggest role to date. Robert DeNiro would later do Raging Bull, but his role here as Travis is excellent. Fresh from The Godfather Part 2, his experience shows in this role. With support like Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Kietel you can't be talking to me about a more capable cast.<br/><br/>The main story has to do with the taxi cab drivers in Manhatten, and New York City. With most of the filming done on the streets it gives the atmosphere a real feeling and the scenes an authentic look. The action scenes are pretty bloody and this is before CGI came along. It is all fictional and the protitution and the mob are a part of the story. <br/><br/>It became notorious that John Hinckley Jr. who attempted to shoot President Reagan is supposed to have gotten a fixation from Jodie Foster's role in this film. While she is good here, DeNiro is definitely the star though Foster's acting in this definitely put her well on the way to stardom. Pretty adult material for her at this age, and it is handled well. As for Hinckley he got released from jail in September, 2016, and is living with his mom.
 <br/><br/>Leonard Harris role as Charles Palantine is the supposed politcan running for President here. The Reagan connection happened long after the movie was released. This is a gritty street story with mobs and cab drivers."

The camera is a great narrator in this. I love all the high shots of the city. It almost takes you in the mind of Deniro. How he views the world. A remarkable, disturbing film that used a unforgettable musical score. The narration by Deniro throughout the movie helped you get in his mind even further. A dark and dreary movie. It really got grim and the script kept you waiting for a giant explosion to happen. It built it slowly and almost reminded me of a Hitchcock feeling to it."

It really makes you realize what war can do to someone. The actor playing Travis does a fantastic job and seems so realistic of a Vietnam veteran. The meaning of this film is so much more than most other films and really hits the viewer. Although the plot is simple it has such a powerful meaning. You can really connect to Travis because at some point in your life everyone feels lonely and you have sympathy for his character."

Many colleges use this film in Arts courses to display and analyze how well it is actually pieced together. The acting and script are very convincing but where it fails is in the actual storyline (which isn't really much). One of the most outstanding features of this sophomore Scorcese effort is that it introduces us to 2 future mega-stars in Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster. Also of note are the supporting performances of Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, and Cybil Sheppard. Albert Brooks also turns in a short but very convincing performance.

","Unusual certainly isn't bad. This movie is just different, and I liked that. One of my favorite things is how they took an ex veteran and placed him back into society, which is a real thing obviously. But what I mean is how he reacts to everything around him, and I find that to be important. It's probably awkward to say, but this movie was tough. The main character was tough, and to see him go to such great lengths for a little girl, it's kinda touching. Violent? Definitely. Kind of perverted? A little, some parts rubbed me the wrong way, and though child prostitution is a real thing, it'll always bother me. That's another important theme to be discussed though, along with veterans trying to come back and make a new life for themselves. The lighting and the effects helped bring this movie to life, and it did really shine for me in the end."

","When diving into this movie you may think this is about living in the city, or about New York City itself. It reality its more than just about that, its showing how the city can tear down someones soul so quickly. Director Scorsese does a great job making you understand that concept. This movie actually surprised me. It wasn't my favorite out of all the other ones I've seen but the actual concept and process of going through the plot was well thought out. The perceptive of the main character is shown really well-showing how he's slightly lost his mind due to the war but still being down to Earth wanting to help people. The scenery shown of NYC is pretty impressive and shows you a different side of it."

","A great psychological film from a master director called Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say who is greater , if it is Robert De Niro as Travis or Martin Scorsese who made the Travis. I'd give in to the argument and come to terms with diplomacy and say both are great but personally, I love Martin more than Robert. Robert sure is a great actor but the way the whole film is handled by Martin is one thing that made a fine beginning for a man, who gave us very very significant films in his career.<br/><br/>Lot goes on in creating an atmosphere that makes us delve into the film as audience and lot more goes into such writing and detailing. Right, from making the room like that of a reckless taxi driver to the setting up of a brothel room the environment is such dream like that it seems like to be a place we see at times in reality and at time in our dreams. Salutations to the Art Director, Cinematographer and the Director who have envisioned such ambiance and resented the same. <br/><br/>The writing.. the screenplay is one that on the face is simple is simple, like Travis (Robert De Niro) preparing for a shoot meticulously and a few shots of holding gun and looking himself in mirror and all will make that. But the execution and enacting the writing is what makes this film special. It's not an easy thing to direct psychological films and that's the very reason I respect guys like Welles, Polanski, Hitchcock and Scorsese above many. <br/><br/>The music score also helps a great deal and thanks to Bernard Hermann to have given such a score that is jazzy, psychedelic and at times creepy too. <br/><br/>OK, now to Robert De NIro, he would have got all the best actor awards, had there not been a ""Network"" coz he carried the character Travis Bickle with such ease on his shoulders that I had felt the same pain as he did, when he is rejected by a girl. Thus, all through he made me empathise with him and took me into his mood, his reason of doing a certain thing. I just gave into Niro's character I must say. <br/><br/>When the last time I saw in 2006 post my engineering days, I could not see any Indian actor but now I see Ranbir Kapoor can replicate a Taxi Driver as he has got in him everything. But I hope, this film is not remade ever and even if it does, it has to be someone like Anurag Kashyap directing Ranbir Kapoor. <br/><br/>A 4/5 for a great film and very important film that has defined psychological films, and indeed was the arrival of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro."

","I think this film is good because of two reasons.<br/><br/>First, both the first scene and the last scene are the same. In the beginning, main character drives a taxi and he disappears into the darkness. In the last scene, he does the same thing. I think that ordinary films are not like this because through stories, main characters change and they become better, happy ending. In this film, main character does not change. His loneliness may increase through the story.<br/><br/>In addition to it, I think the expression of loneliness is good in this film. For example, Travis sees the vulgar town in his taxi, he writes a diary and talks to the mirror. Back music makes these scenes lonelier too. The most impressive scene is that he breaks the TV. I think the reason is that he cannot accept ordinary happiness because he is so a lonely man. He cannot sleep without drags and he doesn't have any people he can rely on. However he tries to make a girlfriend, he fails to it and becomes lonelier. And so finally he plans to assassinate the next president. I think loneliness makes people madness."

Robert DeNiro is one of the best actors of his generation and this was a classic performance from him, he made the film more believable. Taxi Driver is a suspense film and you have no clue what Travis Bickele is going to do, he almost comes across as hero like Batman but with a darker side. Taxi Driver shows what could be going through the mind of a lonely person dealing with depression, and what they could be capable of doing if pushed over the edge. I highly recommend this movie if you love films like American Psycho, Black Swan, and The girl with the Dragon Tattoo."

","People may find this film, repellent, disturbing, disgusting. Some scenes, and I use the word more here, are just repellent. But it's not a nice world out there on the cold streets of New York's lower class areas, populated by all types of sleaze, Deniro so flatteringly describes, as well as to it's solution., many will agree with. He's an unforgettable hero icon, who's been a living inspiration to a lot of wannabe tough guys, and movie goers, and we shares Travis's views, all down the line. He's a fictional character who will never be forgotten, in one of Scorsese's most brilliant and daring works, contrary to many unsavory critics. We shares Travis's world, anger, annoyance, aggravation, frustration, denial, all pent up, but when it explodes towards the end, it's deadly, culminating in him being praised a hero, when returning twelve year pro, Iris (Foster) to her family. Travis, on the account of a lack of sleep, takes a job as a hack- taxi driver, cruising all over town to the worst of it, picking up some real dirt, where too from Deniro's perspective, includes a senator running for the coming election, who again, is all talk. The cab ride scene, with him is interesting to watch from Deniro's slightly tipped mind, praising him, where really he's taking the p..s out of him. It took me a few viewings to grasp onto the concept. Harvey Keitel in one of his best performances, is great as a lowlife, scum sucking pimp. It's a performance of detestable brilliance, while Cybill Shepherd holds your attention, as a sexy campaigner, who's becomes Travis's short lived love, and he is a acute observer of people too. Deniro of course is masterful as Travis Bickle, his eyes, penetrating, sometimes gives us cause to think, violence is only seconds away, his whole body form takes on character, like nothing you've seen before, showing many anxious and nervous emotions. He does have a sort of perverted sense of humor too, but we know where this is leading. Taxi Driver only becomes gory towards the end, in two graphic frank scenes, where he really explodes, but this is what the whole movie has been building up. This is what we've been waiting for. Those scenes are truly warranted. Taxi Driver is masterful work in it's almost now, 40 year existence, and will live on many many years yet as a movie classic, steered by one of the greatest actors on earth. Riveting film making, including one including one repulsively disturbing scene, featuring the director himself."
"lindamillerpt","10","0","0","13 May 2014"," One of my favorites.
","Taxi Driver is Martin Scoresese's best film as far as I am concerned, possibly tied with Goodfellas. It is so hard to review a film like Taxi Driver because there is so much good about it. First of all it paints a portrait of one of the most memorable characters in cinema history as far as I am concerned, that being the portrait of Travis Bickle, played masterfully by Robert Deniro. What an incredible actor Robert Deniro is. He is definitely one of my favorites, and he gives one of his best performances in Taxi Driver. This is a film about a lonely man, and it is illustrated so well as such because Robert Deniro is in almost every single scene in this film. The film deals with him, and only him. The only other characters that the film includes are only as a result of Travis running into them or coming into contact with them, and even when other characters are on screen, the story still remains completely about Travis and very little about the other characters. That makes this film a very simple film. This is not a complex story with multiple story lines. It is a simple story about one man, but that quality makes this film extremely effective. This film is also very much left up to your own interpretation, which is something that I absolutely love in films. An example would be when Travis is talking to the soon-to-be president in the back of his taxi cab and he talks about ""cleaning up New York's streets."" You can think of what he means by that in whatever way that you want. As I said, the acting in this film is incredible by Robert Deniro, but also Jodie Foster brings an outstanding performance to this film as well, playing the twelve year old prostitute, Iris. The direction of this movie and the script writing are also fantastic, and are just a few of the things that make this film incredible. This film also has one of the best endings that I have ever seen. If you have never seen Taxi Driver, do yourself a favor and watch it. It is short, effective and unforgettable. One of my favorite films ever, and also in my opinion one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver gets a 10 out of 10."

In the moment Deniro was definitely Travis no question about it. The grittiness of what New York City use to be was a great back drop for the movie. It is this ambiguity that makes Taxi Driver such an engaging and intelligent film, as the viewer has to think for themselves about who Travis Bickle is, and what his motivations are.

","Taxi Driver is one of those movies that stays with audiences afterwards. It depicts the new Hollywood's ability to really tell a story that seems as if it could be something that really happened. Furthermore, it is significant to the beginning of director Martin Scorsese's career as one of the greatest crime drama directors that will ever live. Taxi Driver reveals for the first time the effect things like returning from war, love obsessions, and living amongst a moral disregarding society can have on someone. Travis works as a moonlighting taxi driver and as a result sees the crime ridden and disgraceful underbelly of NYC. Being subject to this in addition to falling for a women who denies him as a result of his inability to act socially acceptable drives him to act in an irrational state. Among other things Travis begins to acquire several handguns (illegally), murders a grocery store thief with an unregistered weapon, seeks to convert a teenage prostitute into a normal girl, and attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate as well as displaying several disturbing outbursts of anger. All the while he his writing home to his parents conveying to them lies about what he does for work. Travis's transformation from a lonely, confused about life Vietnam veteran into a sort of deranged vigilante indicates he is going to do something drastic. The now psychotic looking Travis (got a mohawk and dressed in military uniform) enters the brothel were the teen prostitute works massacring the pimp, his security guard, and a man who the girl was servicing. Travis is praised for his actions and regarded as hero for putting an end to this unethical activity. But it is not clear his intention was to put an end to this wrongdoing or if this was simply the act of a person who was seriously loosing touch with reality. After coming into contact against with the women he fell for the closing scene shows him looking into his rearview mirror with a once again deranged facial expression. The significance this film has is its illustration of a disturbing reality and the story that occurs within that reality. Such a detailed and realistic portrayal of Travis's life would not have been possible in the classic Hollywood, signifying a new standard of what was to come of crime dramas and films in general."

Although he isn't your usual good guy he does want to help and make the world better and his way of helping is by helping a 13 year old girl, Iris, who recently was left by her pimp, oh did I mention she was a 13 year old prostitute. This movie is definitely a psychological drama and Scorsese uses certain editing tools to increase our eagerness. He uses a lot of slow camera movement to build up the expectation. The movie also takes place in New York City, which is paints at this horrifying place by making the scenes dark and unpleasant. One editing tool that Scorsese uses that really put us in the mind of Travis were the voice over. One example of this was when Travis is reading his diary, but all of sudden mid sentence the shot cuts and repeats itself. Your first thought might be that the movie skip or there was some type of error, but no, it actually is meant to abruptly stop and start over again. This edit is done to show us how Travis' mind really works, it give us an inside look on how Travis' thoughts flow, and his current mental state.

The innocent this time is a young Jodie Foster, who plays a child prostitute who just wants to go home to her family. The soundtrack is very ""New York City"" and adds to the overall tone of the film, and DeNiro shines in this role.

","Taxi Driver is a film that marked the start of the 'modern filmmaking'. Scorsese, in fact, still haven't done anything as good as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull' yet, not coincidentally both came in his earlier filmmaking years. 'Taxi Driver' is not much different than Scorsese's recent works, it has the vulgarity and the dirty life in the streets as focus, but differently than films like 'Goodfellas' and recently 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Taxi is done with an artistic approach, instead of just a thin paper of vulgarities translated for the screen. <br/><br/>The most interesting thing about this film, is the character development. You really want to hate the driver, because is admittedly a despicable, antisocial, racist crazy freak. But we are so near to him all the time that's virtually impossible. We feel sorry for him, but never hate him. He believe in what he believes, and the viewer knows and understand why, despite him being wrong. That is really interesting. Somehow, you can forgive all his faults. Then he tries to establish a relation with a woman, and in the beginning they do relatively well with each other, judging by the circumstances of their meeting, but quickly he realizes that she is way too different of her(in his head, he thinks that she is as dirty as the rest of the world). He became even more upset after that 'big' disappointment, even because he really don't likes the 'dirty' people. and by 'dirty' he refers to prostitutes, bandits, people that works and have a social life, and the most controversial of all: he hates 'blacks'. He is racist, noteworthy. And a completely antisocial person, but that is easily assumable.<br/><br/>His 'rage' against the world just grows more and more, and there is a point when he start to think about really f***** up stuff. He buy guns and then becomes to train and also mastering his abilities of 'hit-man'. He became determined to 'clean' the streets, but his thoughts never turn in actions. He just drive his taxi at night and then train with his weapons in the free-time, but never do nothing about it. I think this is an interesting concept, you know, about people who have fear to concrete his actions. Its an spot on metaphor, because this really happens, people which never create courage to do what he wants to. So, we all know that he isn't a crazy psycho, I mean, he still crazy, but we know that psychos don't hesitate, feel fear, or anything.<br/><br/>But apart from the 'most interesting' thing, there is also the 'most important' thing about the film, who shall be understood. It's, after all, a harsh critic about those individuals that put the fault in everyone due to their condition, but not in themselves, and how this human beings are egocentric. Noteworthy, how the 'driver' behavior changed, after doing something he considered 'relevant' in his life. He simply became a cool person(apparently) after that. Is a fantastic metaphor, it's basically saying if people could do everything they wanted to, so they would be not upset about the world, that in their vision is being 'unfair' with them. Obviously, it's my point of view, can be refuted or accepted but will still a theory and my point of view. There is more thoughts about the film here than the content about the film itself, I guess, but I just think that's a film that it's content can't be told at all only with detailing about his components, how it was made etc., so a superficial review about the cinematography, the storyline and the direction, wouldn't be enough, in my opinion. It's a film that really left you thinking about it for a long time. It's rich in content, and open for various interpretations. Dawn, I don't even mentioned about the 'contradiction' idea, which is the base for the story of the driver. So, as you see, there is a lot of stuff in the film to be analyzed.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I think that's a done review, perhaps it's a review targeted more for people who have watched the film, but it hasn't 'super spoilers' or something like that either. I didn't tell even half the story, so if you'll haven't watched it just yet and read my review, don't worry. You'll still enjoy it, for sure. Now, my rating is 9.5/10. One of Scorsese best, alongside Raging Bull, and It absolutely deserves it's 'classic status'. What more can I say? Watch this film."

The problem was that I was very settled with the sorts of movies I enjoyed, I thought I only enjoyed old Hollywood classics or human dramas, anything with a slight mention of violence or action would turn me off. So for a very long time I put off seeing Taxi Driver – this was the biggest misjudgement I have made in all my life when it comes to films. When I finally did see Taxi Driver it changed my opinion of cinema and left me feeling very silly for thinking that I could pre-guess what I liked before I had seen it. I had sat down thinking I would get nothing out of the film, however after it had ended I was blown away. Taxi Driver is a highly regarded film but I knew in that moment that this film will never be regarded highly enough.<br/><br/>The films main character Travis Bickle (Robert De Nero) is a truly fascinating human. On one hand it is feasible to see him as a possible saint, someone who wants the world to be a better place, someone who wishes to fight and strike out against evil. On the other hand one could see him as the most messed up of all humans. To me, neither is true. He is in fact in the same mindset as all other humans in the film, but is way past the psychological stage which lets them deal with the faults of humanity in humane ways. In a way, Travis is just an extreme version of all of us. He has more anger to want to clean the streets of evil. However, there is a good and evil way to go about this, but in the end Travis chooses the latter. This sees him kill several evil people in the name of something good – but what's to say that in doing this Travis has not become an evil force himself?<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a brilliant visual treat as many of Scorsese's other films are. Its imagery ranks beside the most iconic in the history of cinema. The films editing leaves you on your toes at every scene, not for one moment is there even a hint that pace will slow or that the style will steer off course. Yes, the film is very violent at times, while this is horrific, it does evoke a very strange reaction in me. Questioning whether this violence is necessary to beat evil, or if by becoming violent one only adds to evil in the world. This is such a hard moral question but is one that Taxi Driver presents very well.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about Taxi Driver is its main theme by Bernard Herrmann. This was Herrmann's last big score before his death in 1975. The music works extremely well with Scorsese's gloomy imagery of night time New York and submerses the audience very deep into the mind-set of Travis Bickle, which at times is a very scary place to be.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is an in-depth character study of good and evil, how they work with and without each other and how they can both lead to disastrous consequences. Taxi Driver is a must see film."
"The-Sarkologist","9","0","0","11 December 2013"," Into the mind of Travis Binkle
","This movie is brilliant and is based around a man named Travis Binkle. As I said previously, he is a very dangerous man. I say that because he knows how to kill, and he will do it without hesitation. He kills only four people in the entire movie, but we can see that he desires to see many more people dead. His history is that he used to be a US marine, and that makes him even more dangerous.<br/><br/>At first we are allowed into Binkle's mind through his writings, but the further into the movie we go, the less we are allowed to see. At first he is very descriptive of everything that happens, right down to what he and Betsie order on their first date. As the movie goes on, his writings become less detailed, and he explains his actions even less, and as such we are left to work out why he is doing what he does.<br/><br/>Binkle is the type of character that we can relate to, but don't want to. We see ourselves inside of him but it is a side of us that we chose to ignore and to suppress. He is a violent man that is repulsed by the lack of morality in society and the deceitfulness of the policy makers. He takes little interest in the dressings of society, such as music, movies, and politics, but he immerses himself, though not participating in, the decrepit vices of society. He sees himself as a cleaner whose job it is to clean society, but realises that the job is far to big for him, so he settles on releasing those who are entrapped within this evil.<br/><br/>As such we are introduced to two women: Betsie, a campaign worker for presidential candidate Palantine; and Iris, a twelve year old prostitute caught up in the world of vice and not understanding the truth of its destructive nature. These two women are opposite in everyway, yet Travis sees them both as being trapped. He sees Palantine in the same light as Iris' pimp Sport: both are peddlers of lies and deceits, and both have had experiences in Travis' cab. Sport drags Iris out of the cab when Iris attempts to leave, while Palantine uses it once with a prostitute and a second time for a ride to the airport. Iris has run away from home and has been caught up in prostitution and drugs, while Betsy is a campaign worker for Palantine who seems to be hassled by some guy that works in the same office.<br/><br/>As such, Travis sees Palantine and Sport as men who are holding these women prisoner. Palantine is a gaolor in a metaphorical way while Sport is a gaolor in a physical way - yet Travis views both of them with contempt and chooses to kill both of them. He doesn't manage to kill Palantine, but he does manage to kill Sport.<br/><br/>This is the climax of the movie, when Travis goes through Sport's apartment killing all of his men simply to rescue Iris, who says she does not want to be rescued. In fact neither woman wants to be rescued, though Iris occasionally sees the trap that she is in, but generally chooses to ignore it. Now, if Travis killed Palantine, he would be called a murderer and probably have been executed, but instead he kills Sport and his gang, and though we expect him to be considered a murderer, and even he realises that he has done a huge wrong when he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger, even though it is empty. Instead of being a murder, he is praised as a hero - the ultimate irony.<br/><br/>The final thing that I wish to discuss here is the nature of Travis Binkle's loneliness. The only character we really get to know is Travis Binkle and even though he desires to build a relationship with another person, namely a woman, he simply does not know how. He attempts to court Betsie, but destroys that when he takes her to a pornographic movie, and when he attempts to reconcile with her, she simply does not want to know him. Martin Scorsese says that the scene when he is on the phone with her and she rejects him is one of the most important scenes in the movie for the depth of Binkle's pain reaches its lowest, yet the camera shies away from Binkle at that time for we are not meant to know how harsh his pain is.<br/><br/>Binkle simply does not seem to understand the nature of relationships. He is not a selfish man, and he does not live to excesses, but he simply does not know how to relate with another human being. Most of the time he spends in the movie is alone, or driving somebody around. He tries to reach out but nobody is willing to grasp hold of him and pull him out of his spiral of destruction. The only respect he does receive is from the parents of Iris who are over joyed that their daughter has been returned to them, but they are unable to visit Travis, and thus he is once again left on his own.<br/><br/>The movie closes with Betsie returning to Binkle, but by now it is too late. He has left her far behind and now that his violent rage has been let out upon Sport and his gang, he is back to his quiet unassuming self. But a lot of time has passed since Betsie left him, and now when she returns, he no longer sees her the same, and as such lets her out of the cab never to see her again."

","I watched taxi driver for the first time when I was 18. At that time I knew this was a really great movie. I then revisited it over a year later and realized it was a cinematic masterpiece. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as Travis Bickel. This is also one of Martin Scorsese's finest work as a director. A strong supporting cast including a then 14 year old Jodie Foster, Cybil Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle contribute to this outstanding film. The story is about a New York City taxi driver's assent into madness. I highly recommend you see this film for the acting, directing, and also because it is one of the greatest films of all time."

","Quite possibly the greatest character study of a man's descent into madness. ""Taxi Driver"" came screaming out of 1976 winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and showcasing the talents of two youths from the Bronx. Writer Paul Schrader wrote the script in less than a week, and was heavily influenced by the self narration and themes of Robert Bresson's ""Pickpocket"" (1959). He, De Niro and Scorsese would go on and change the face of 1970's American cinema drastically.<br/><br/>To those who have seen it, I think everyone can understand and connect on some level with Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro at his finest). A troubled mind isolated from the outside world, addicted to porn and ""supposedly"" back from the Vietnam War. Suffering insomnia and chronic pill popping, he decides that if he wanders around aimlessly at night anyway he might as well get paid for it. He takes a job as a taxi driver, working over hours and traversing all city zones. Unfortunately for Travis these kind of late hours expose himself to the ""filth"" of New York, that was literally at the time porno theatres, prostitution and drug dealers etc.<br/><br/>All this we see through his eyes, and we vaguely connect with the kind of hatred he feels (A little hypocritical because he also watches porn compulsively). After unsuccessfully trying to court political campaign volunteer Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he frequently ends up bumping into the life of Iris (Jodie Foster), a 12 year old prostitute (Her pimp is played by the enigmatic Harvey Kietel). After realising he is truly alone and unable to shake off his worries even with the advice from other taxi drivers (Amongst them acting legend Peter Boyle), Travis ultimately snaps and decides to take the law into his own hands.<br/><br/>What follows is a plethora of famous movie quotes, and Robert De Niro's tour-de force performance. Filled with motifs and themes what with the Mohawk haircut (Based on real accounts of soldiers after Vietnam), Travis's alleged racism and circumstances where he could have easily been hailed as public enemy no. 1 instead of a hero. Paul Schrader revealed that the script's hidden message was for Travis to try and successfully kill the father figure of the women he knows (Infamously John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Reagan in 1981, in a bid to impress Jodie Foster after watching the movie). All of which leads to an ending that has been debatable over the years, yet a somewhat redemption at least lies for our fallen cabbie. <br/><br/>No other film has ever depicted New York quite like ""Taxi Driver"" since. It's also one of the movies that you can successfully share the characters feelings of loneliness and possibly find some kind reassurance that even Hollywood leading actors can feel sad now and then. The camera flows through the simple narrative, and Scorsese employs the right kind of close ups at the right time (The scene Martin declared the most important is where Travis grovels down the phone and the camera moves to the right, because it is to pathetic to bear). Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrmann's haunting final score that plays throughout is my all-time favourite piece of movie music, because I love Jazz and it accompanies the lit up nightlife and credit scenes beautifully (Albeit it's played a little too much throughout the movie).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: If I were to ever make a top favourite list, ""Taxi Driver"" would most definitely be in my top 5 (A little unhealthy I know). De Niro is flawless, and Director Martin Scorsese's camera work makes it all look effortless. The narrative and setting all feels self contained, but the slow progression of madness feels that anything could eventually happen. 10/10. There really isn't anything else quite like it."

","Taxi Driver is one of favored movies by critics primarily because it presents a realistic, or you may say naturalistic, portrait of life in a mirror, which can show a man who shaves his head for no good reason, who will even doubt about his own existence, who are you talking to? talking to me?, and love. the protagonist through the story falls in love, makes an attempt to kill a politician, ruins his relationship with a foolish behavior toward his beloved and then kills a man and saves a prostitute. this is all that life is about, frequent mistakes and always being on the verge of becoming a hero or a fool. great acting by Deniro and Judy Foster makes it so great a movie. and the scene that Deniro shoots at the man is like the most real murder you can ever see in a movie."

","""Taxi Driver"" is a grim, grim Film. It captures perfectly the Hell that Man inflicts on his fellow Man, but also the Hell a man (Travis) inflicts upon himself. It doesn't feel linear, or even coherent. Put simply, one feels when watching this Movie that the plot is secondary, expendable even. If Travis had just taken a different route one night, an equally unpleasant story would have arrived, and manifested itself in pretty much the exact same way. It's the characters, mirror images of the Us we must ignore to function, that make this so fascinating. The Film seems initially uncertain, part character sketch, part love story, part crime drama. Really though, it's all about one man: Travis Bickle. This man's disassociation with Life and general misanthropy could have seen him be a pivotal figure in 1976's emerging Punk Rock scene, but instead we find him a mentally unstable, ex-Nam vet. Forget violence, sex, drugs, Travis is the most frightening thing in this Movie. Analytic to an agonizing degree, derision and loathing flow freely, heaped upon the decadent underbelly of NYC. Travis's diary detail his justification for wanting to ""flush this city down a f*****' toilet"", but as later exploits reveal, Travis has no higher moral ground: he's an unhinged maniac, and any channel to express this frustration, anger, fury will be seized, instantly. Any target is enough, be they depraved scum or Political Leader. <br/><br/>In conclusion, watching this man descend into the very depths of Mental Hell is an experience you may enjoy, possibly. Will you forget it quickly? Unlikely."

","Take it from someone who drove a cab for years: the TAXI DRIVER scenario is all-too-plausible. DeNiro's performance is dead on: I saw more than one ""Travis Bickle"" out there on the streets at night, men who carried guns (though it's illegal for a cabbie to carry one in this town), who drove drunk (or worse), who robbed passengers (often by running what's known as ""a hot meter,"" where the meter is switched from a mileage counter to a timer, usually at long stoplights, thereby allowing the driver to make more money off of the unwitting passenger) and who talked incessantly of ""cleaning up the city"" (a common refrain, especially among former cops). Of course, some of this behavior is understandable: cabbies themselves must pay for their own gas at the end of every shift (which means that, more often than one would wish, one ends up owing The Company money at the end of the night); the driver eats it when a customer bails out on him and doesn't pay (a common occurrence with college kids, who think it's funny); if a cab goes down (usually because of a slack mechanic- and the term ""reliable mechanic"" is as much an oxymoron as ""honest lawyer"" or ""trustworthy politician""), it's the Driver (as most of them like to be called, ""hack"" or ""cabbie"" being each in their own way demeaning) who's s*** out of luck: bills to pay or not, if there's no cab for you to drive, you don't go out; and robbery (you're on your own if you get robbed- and, if you don't have the money to pay The Company their 50% of each fare for the night, you OWE The Company). Because I wasn't part of the Inner Circle where I worked, I usually got the s***-end of the stick every night- what were known as ""the crack runs."" I wasn't allowed to refuse a fare and, because the dispatcher had it in for me, I eventually came to be known as Crack Man. More than once, I came THIS close to dying out there: I once had a crack dealer literally hanging from the passenger window of my cab grappling with my passenger over a piece of ""rock"" (crack cocaine). A crowd of dealers charged my cab. I proceeded to pull a manuver that I remembered, quite literally, from Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND (see chapter five). It saved my life. Anyone who can't buy the premise of TAXI DRIVER has never driven a cab."

","New York City on summer nights has a certain feel to it, and ""Taxi Driver"" managed to capture the intensity of its atmosphere. De Niro does an amazing job as the disturbed Bickle, who acts irrationally and in ways which may escape the audience, but this is suitable to his character, his mindset. The perspective of being in the cab, seeing his point of view, adds to this and draws you further into the scummy side of the city. The problems Foster's character faces are still all too relevant today forty years later, and this movie is great in turning a murder into a heroic act and revealing the trafficking and exploitation of young people as the crime. Even after such an iconic movie focusing on the subject it is an issue largely ignored. Calling Bickle a hero is questionable, not only because of his actions but because of his mental state as well. He is constantly lonely and sinking into psychosis throughout, with the dark photography and despicable New York as the perfect backdrop."

","Travis Bickle is a disgruntled war veteran who feels alone in a big city. Travis obviously has demons from his childhood, or the war. Travis, played by Robert De Niro, has a warrior mentality and shaves his head into a Mowhawk. Travis wants to fix the problems with society all while engaging in deviant activities such as viewing pornography and planning for violence. <br/><br/>Travis tries to save a young prostitute showing his softer side, but his violence eventually comes out after being rejected by a woman he is pursuing.

","A very steller performance by Robert De Niro. He is an estranged ex vet who works the latenight shift as a taxi driver. He feels as if he has no real purpose after the war and has a tendency to find himself in trouble from his violent outlashes. Eventually he finds a prostitute whom he begins to care about and watch after. It starts to pick up a lot of pace at some points and also has some slow points.It also does a very good job of portraying the city environment to add to the realism. The lighting in scenes really helps set the mood. There are a lot of twists and scenes that keep you nailbitting. I think it is a great movie that should be seen by everyone."

","This film was excellent. No other way to phrase it, really. De Niro is an incredible actor in everything he does; but this movie was good for more reasons than just De Niro's unmatchable talent. The message of the loneliness and torture inside a disturbed mind is one that is not frequented enough by film. Yet one could argue that it is one of the most important phenomenons to be aware of. In an age where random violence is becoming increasingly more prevalent and excessive media coverage is bringing these stories of real-life horrors into everyone's living rooms, it seems bizarre that as a society we are not more interested in the abnormal psychology of the human mind. The irony of Travis' loneliness in the middle of New York City, one of the most densely populated areas in the country, is another thing that brings meaning to this film. Loneliness is a state of mind; not something that happens just from physical isolation from people. The final scene was hard to watch, I'll admit. The ugliness of the raw violence was almost too much for me to handle. But I also found some realness in this murder scene that doesn't seem to appear in movies as much today. This film was absolutely excellent and I highly recommend it!"

","Taxi Driver is Martin Scorsese's harrowing portrait of an introverted man so lost in his own purgatory that he seeks a method of escape to radical extremes. There have been little films quite like Taxi Driver and yet the issue is one so universal but difficult to illustrate. Behind the waxy façade of the yellow cabbie, Taxi Driver is quite literally the story of a killer. Like most of Scorsese's works, Taxi Driver is guiltily enticing.<br/><br/>The film utilizes a known Scorsese technique which would later become a hallmark for the director's later films; the technique is an insider looking out, or vice versa. In Taxi Driver, 26-year old introvert Travis Bickle is plagued with insomnia, bad hygiene and a mural of desensitizing images created by New Yorkers, after dark. New York City itself is an inferno, a feculent wasteland of scum, dirt, and trash. There are no red, white, and blue American flags here. Lady Liberty is far from the screen. Bickle's New York is virtually a labyrinthine Hell. Bickle is summed up by the amount of narration he provides and the cab fare he earns. There's empty coke cans strewn about his apartment; at one point we see him concocting his own food of bread, sugar, and whiskey. He's in a vapor lock and is pestered by this transparent issue for the duration of the film. Whether it's behind the windows of his taxi cab, through the glass frame of a political office, or even into the cumbersome television set, Travis is never immersed with other people. He's an observer who cannot tolerate the scum around him but on the contrary wishes to conform and fit in. For this very reason, Taxi Driver is a masterful depiction of an introvert's zest to fit in with an extrovert world. Bickle always weighs himself down with the self-righteous image of those extroverts around him. Never once does he consider his own life as self-sustaining, indulgent, meaningful, or normal. He's God's lonely man.<br/><br/>Opposite Bickle's voyage into madness are politicians and scumbags. The politicians are played by Cybill Shepherd as Bickle's dream woman Betsy, and Albert Brooks as Tom, a political adviser. Politics are something Travis can never understand, and a pivotal reason for this is its necessity for cooperation, community and teamwork. Bickle only lives in and out of his quixotic fantasies, never once actually considering his own political preference, or what Betsy and Tom strive for. Thus the politicians are the epitome of all extroverts—a social club that Travis could never possibly join. Senator Palatine, the elected official, is the personification of New York citizenship. Palatine's logo is ""We ARE the people"". Travis must have construed this negatively, hence his descent into pure isolation.<br/><br/>The other group featured here are pimps and whores in Manhattan's alphabet city, a vile block of bricked tenements that, in one upward pan shot, are bleeding from the windows in ethnic minorities and undermined citizens. The ""lowest scum"" as Travis describes is ""Sport"", a pimp who panhandles and profits off of an uncertain 12-year old girl Iris, nicknamed ""Easy"". The second half of the movie engages in Travis's agenda to free Iris from the clutches of the pimp business. I reconsider that he not only wants Iris out of that city block, but out of New York altogether. There's a moment where Iris scoffs at Bickle, tantalizing him for judging without seeing past the end of his own nose. It's an interesting dynamic when a 12 year old girl recognizes everything wrong with a recalcitrant 26 year old man who in his own mind, doesn't understand the rest of society. The brilliant part about Iris and Bickle's scenes is how they are both misfits, able to see each other's issues without wholly acknowledging their own. The two are both trapped in impossible love stories: Iris in the hands of an unscrupulous pimp while Travis is crestfallen over the rejection from Palatine-supporter, Betsy.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is such an earnest approach to the dehumanizing of a man that it might frighten some audiences. It all depends on the viewpoint of the viewer. If you're anything like Palatine or Betsy, you'll surely laugh at how crazy and incorrigible Bickle is. But for those insiders looking out, here is a fine catharsis."

","Although I've seen Taxi Driver many times, on TV and on DVD, today I had the rare opportunity of watching it on the big screen, seated in a dark theatre room, the way all movies should be seen. No matter how many times I watch the movie, and in whatever conditions, I never cease to be amazed at this movie, at its boldness, at the fact it exists at all. The '70s are my favourite era of film, both in American and around the world, and for me Taxi Driver is one of its most magnificent achievements, so many decades later still towering over many of that decade's masterpieces, so ahead of its time the tribulations of the protagonist still disturb modern viewers by how prescient and immediate they are.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who can't sleep at nights and drives around, and so he may as well do that for money. Bickle is lonely, socially inept, almost always wears his army jacket, his name written on the back, a part of his identity he clings to tenaciously. Bickle is the proverbial nobody, but in his slowly-decaying mind he conjures thoughts of becoming a great man, of doing something important. His thoughts, though, are as blurry as his conversational skills and he's not sure what he wants to achieve, what ideas are those. Nevertheless constantly writes in his diary that he wants to clean up the city, which is an open sewer full of filth, and the movie slowly shows Bickle changing into a megalomaniac vigilante with delusions of grandeur. The movie, and Bickle, are preparing the viewer for a spectacular finale, and they don't disappoint.<br/><br/>Although the movie makes it clear Bickle is slightly unbalanced from the first moment we see him, applying to a job as a cabbie (in a short but memorable scene with Joe Spinell), it doesn't bother trying to give reasons, or any background on his past life. His hatred for lowlifes, pushers, prostitutes and pimps isn't a cause but just something his already deranged brain focuses to release his anger. When he tries to be an ordinary man, and find love and companionship, we see how out of his element he is. His conversations with other cabbies are always tense and awkward. And when he tries to date Betsy, a woman (Cybill Shepherd) involved in a campaign to get Senator Palantine elected as President, she breaks up with him when he casually takes her to a porn movie. When his experiments at normalcy fail, he concentrates his efforts and money to remake himself into a vigilante with a confused plan to murder Palantine on vague motives (Bickle's mind is hazy, the movie never is – it just puts the viewer right in his head, which probably makes not a lot of sense even to himself) before becoming obsessed with saving a teenage prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her smooth-talking pimp (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>Every scene and line in this movie is carefully thought to show Bickle's deranged state of mind and to carefully and thoroughly chronicle his descent into suicidal madness. Few movies are more perfect than Taxi Driver in bringing together all aspects of filmmaking into a perfect whole. Lawrence of Arabia, Chinatown and 2001: A Space Odyssey before, and a handful since. It's a marvel to see it unwind before your eyes: the dialogue, the performances of everyone, the shots of New York at night, Bernard Herrmann's half romantic half bleak score so often perfectly mirroring and enhancing Bickle's state of mind. Although DeNiro is to commend for this performance, undoubtedly the best of his career, all the other actors are equally excellent, from Shepherd to Foster, from Keitel to a young Albert Brooks in a short but wonderfully comical role. Martin Scorsese's direction was perhaps never this crisp and accurate again, and Paul Schrader never wrote such a remarkable screenplay again. It's clear on every scene that these men and women brought their best talent to the movie, and thanks to their hard work we've been graced with one of the best movies ever made."

We transport people from one spot to another and connect them with those important to them, as Marx quoted we would be ""an urban ghost"". Painstaking, lower class, boring and working with loneliness. Passengers pay, and we are heading to any direction or anywhere appointed to us, even the hell provided you tip well. I am just a humble servant behind the wheels, not entitled to ask anything about why they choose their destination, I can't choose my own way, just a zombie obeying orders from my superior as Travis did in the Military, the difference is now he's serving another god, the customer in the back seat. He never made a choice of his own.<br/><br/>Temptation Of Sleep<br/><br/>This can be a monologue of a taxi driver, or such confusion applies to the modern generation. But the point of this film is that in position of a taxi driver, it is focused and amplified, he is aware and awake all the time, he silences and drives, he saw and couldn't let it go, and end up in pain and insomnia. <br/><br/>Wheras we could fall asleep easily. Sleep helps us forget what we shouldn't keep in mind. We ignore the dark side of the society and enjoy ourselves in the production-consumption cycle, but for some upright souls that's irresponsible. Our veteran driver witnesses the dirty city, with a good will at the beginning, he had Bess, ""pure as an angel out of this filthy mess"", and her campaign team stand for a political hope for the citizens especially for our driver, if elected this new administration may wash away all the unjust and foul on earth. Bess and her team is a piece of white paper, an utopia for our idealist, it represent an exit door for him, so once the door shut down by her refusal, he confused and became angry. <br/><br/>Bess could not help him any more, his colleague the witch couldn't help him, so as a veteran he had to rearmed hims with weapons he no longer needed, yes the guns, he thought he would never touch them in a civil society since he discharged from the Marine, so he declined other fellow driver's suggestion and insist that he didn't need one to protect himself, but now he believed he's in need of one to reestablish order and justice. If the politicians couldn't wash away the scum off the street, then he should replace them or even perish them.<br/><br/>A Return To Greatness<br/><br/>So he walked out of his taxi and reenter the society to interfere. He met the underage prostitute and mentioned that he wanted to ""take actions"". His ultimate goal, probably ""A return to greatness?"" as is the propaganda poster issued by Candidate Goodwin, what a coincidence! Goodwin means Good wins and defeats the evil on earth, in this campaign it indicates Travis on Goodwin's side against Bess and her senator candidate. Yes Travis knows little about politics and politicians like the senator were just making use of the ignorance of the public for their own profit, votes and power. Travis saw through this and was disappointed by it, so his political utopia and romantic illusion broke at the same time, he couldn't count on other's mercy to achieve ""Good"", if he still expect ""A return to greatness"", he's all alone.<br/><br/>Unfortunately return to greatness is an unseasonable slogan, far less popular than ""We are the people"" with ""WE"" underlined. The masses don't care greatness, they are obsessed with mediocre stuff, free choice and cheaper goods. Then for Travis, after an unsuccessful murder of the so- called leader, rescuing an underage prostitute would definitely remained to be a meaningful thing to do, it is absolutely a right thing, no doubt about it. While really? It turned out Iris was rather satisfied with her life as a prostitute, she didn't feel the need to be saved by anyone, it's her independent decision as a child, not an adult yet though, would you please mind your own business, Mr Driver?<br/><br/>It's also the democracy dilemma. In a democracy people believe that they can make their own choice, but was that the ultimate good? Is greatness something worth to pursue? Modernization has blurred the distinction between good and bad, the driver wanted to restore the great order, he failed, he would be called a dictator if he force someone else in the name of their good, wouldn't he? We can sleep quietly and comfortably at night, he can't, he's awake, all the time. <br/><br/>It's always good when someone keep awake watching and thinking when most are sleeping."

","Before I started to watch this movie, I was awed by whatever I had heard about this classic and was also in awe of the two legends involved - Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Nero. Immediately after watching this, I was a bit disappointed. This is not to say this wasn't a good work of cinema, which it is, but guess I am a victim of ""The Over-hype"". After a few hours when I pondered upon my experience, the cinematic excellence of this classic dawned upon me. It is not as smart and hard-hitting like my other Martin Scorsese's favorites (""The Departed"", Gangs of New York), but this one grows on you. This film had it all - good starcast (its all about Robert Di Nero), good camera-work, strong script to work with, nice editing to tie-up the movie, apt music which added to the element of the movie (as intended by the director) and of course, strong direction to bring it all together.<br/><br/>The first aspect that impressed me was the way story was portrayed by Mr.Martin Scorsese. If you actually look at it, this is just another story about a disturbed Nam marine who is back and is trying to adjust to his life post coming back from war. He is a loner, disturbed and wants to clean the streets cowboy-style. It could very-well have ended as just another action flick. But Mr.Scorsese had other plans. The movie started with the new york streets and how filthy / busy they are. At the same time, no shot was particularly stretched - it was all shot in passing, like a dream. The continuous shots of the streetlights and the traffic signals was actually very psychedelic, as if on drugs . The saxophone music, while adding a touch of classic element, was making the viewer very comfortable, as if watching in half sleep. Now I realize that it was all because this was how the protagonist was feeling - he could not sleep (insomnia). What a wonderful way to invite the viewer right in the midst of the protagonist's life ! It feels like I was made to be the cab passenger of Travis's taxi and I watched everything from the back seat. Cinematic excellence at its best !<br/><br/>Travis (Robert Di Nero) has been shown to be very eccentric with a quirky sense of humour, which was very rusty at times. His character (disturbed war hero) demanded such confused feelings and reactions. One of the best performances by Mr.Robert Di Nero (Raging Bull with Scorsese being another noteworthy one). ""You Looking at me?"" will always be an iconic phrase for all times to come.<br/><br/>This review would not be complete without the mention of Bernard Herrmann's background score. The soundtrack brings out the central theme of the movie in the viewer's mind - loneliness and at times its absolutely terrifying. Deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie could have been categorized as action/crime but Mr.Scorsese made it a drama/crime movie and portrayed a strong nightmarish experience. Its a down-right riveting piece of film-making. I give it 8.5 out of 10."

","Taxi Driver isn't one of those movies where you can just sit down any moment and watch the film nor is this film for everyone. The film is told from the view point of a taxi driver named Travis, played by legendary actor Robert de Niro. It tells the tale of this taxi driver who begins to question the life around him during his time as a nighttime taxi driver and eventually attempts to put an end to the scum the city has produced. <br/><br/>The acting, first of all, is brilliant. Robert de Niro is in this movie...Need I say anymore about him. A younger Jodie Foster is also in this movie as Iris, a young girl who is a prostitute who was unable to be saved by Travis one night and was set off with a bribe. This continues to haunt him and so, Travis leads a rescue mission to save Iris and reduce the town of its violence. <br/><br/>The movie is simply said, flawless in every manner. There isn't a weak part about the film. The character of Travis is very interesting, the dialogue is moving, the acting and direction is brilliant and the story is great. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, this movie isn't for everyone and many will not like this movie if the genre of Drama doesn't suit them.

","Taxi Driver is just an awesome movie. I can't really think of what else to say about it. It's an awesome movie, and everyone knows it. But what makes it so awesome? Well for me, there are a lot of things. First of all, Robert De Niro is always awesome. This was the movie that really kicked off his career, and he's what makes this movie. Second of all, I love how dark and gritty this movie is. I know there were movies in the late 60s and early 70s that were really violent, but Taxi Driver took it to the next level with its gritty cinematography, realistic setting, and amazing performances. This movie feels so real, that it's actually kind of disturbing. Just like Midnight Cowboy, this is an ugly movie, but that's where a lot the appeal comes from. Third, I love low budget movies that become iconic. It doesn't have the perfection and class of The Godfather movies, but that's what makes it so effective. The low budget look and ugly tone make the movie seem all too real, and not to far off from reality. It's actually very inspiring for anyone who wants to become a filmmaker. Fourth, it was one of the first movies to show the hardships veterans of the Vietnam War had trying to fit back into society (the dark tone of the movie emphasizes how tragic a thing it is for soldiers who have returned home). Soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War were often protested, so I'm glad this movie addressed how difficult it really is for them. Taxi Driver is just an all around great movie. It may be dark, it may be bloody, it may be a little too ""real"" for some people, and it may have almost gotten President Reagan killed; but if you're looking for a movie that defines awesome, then Taxi Driver is that movie."

","Essential film to watch. Director Martin Scorsese, and Screenwriter Paul Schrader shows a life full of private fear, emptiness, and loneliness in 'Taxi Driver'. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is that Taxi Driver, a Vietnam Vet whom seldom speak whom drifts in and out of 1970's New York City wicked night life. He witness a lot of wrongs and faults in civilization by how the people act around him. Robert De Niro character is similar to Don Quixote and Dostoyevsky's ''Idiot''. He is a good man trapped in an evil and sick world ,the difference with Travis is that he gets through it by becoming even more vicious than the world of slime, he inhabits whereas Quixote remains delusional and dies and the 'idiot' goes insane. He slowly growing tired of it, and losing hope and looks for a way out. These supporting cast ''way out' are Betsie and Iris. (Cybil Sheppard & Jolie Foster). Both being symbolic of Travis having a madonna/whore complex somewhat. Betsie is a campaign volunteer for Sentaor Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris) who is running for President.. Iris is a 12-year-old child prostitute who is attempting to escape her pimp Matthew 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel) who he becomes obsessed with helping her return to her parents' home, sending her money to do so and a letter in which he states he will soon be dead. Disgusted by the street crime, politics and prostitution that he witnesses through the city, Travis finds a focus for his frustration and begins a program of intense physical training and shaving his head into a mohawk as he become a weapon for violence. The scary underlying concept in the movie that many overlook is that Travis Bickle is the manifestation of America of the 1970s. A confused society recovering from the failed war in Vietnam, from poverty of the working-class, from racism towards blacks, from drug addiction, and from mental illness. Bickle has adopted the confused mix of the military values of militancy, honor, and chivalry (his initial modest courtship of Betsy) with sexual perversion, racism, and disillusionment with society. The ending of the movie can be interpreted in many ways. Was Travis a hero or villain? Did he die or live? Some people might not like the movie, due to the sexual and racist undertones in the film, the violence, and the cursing. Taxi Driver is and will always be a disturbing film, however it's thought provoking and now there is a lot of depth to be seen in this very critical film. It's an experiment, NOT entertainment, only vaguely art. It presents no solutions, promotes despair, and really is a glorification of violence, and of the filmmakers own self conscious congratulations of himself on his own daring. It's a experiment of the mind."

","Taxi Driver is widely considered by film critics as one of the greatest films ever made. It is indeed an impressive work of cinematic art and a very powerful unforgettable film. However, I would say that it is not flawless and it doesn't achieve everything.<br/><br/>One of the major problems of this film was the lack of rationality regarding the behavior of the main character. Of course, that was the whole point of the film, but the way Scorsese did it was to make him take out a girl on a date to watch a porn film! That's ludicrous. Nobody with two working neurons would ever act in such a way. While film doesn't need and shouldn't be realistic one has to make the viewer engage in suspension of disbelief and to make a taxi driver take a girl on a date to see a porn film is more ludicrous on context than anything in the Lord of the Rings films.<br/><br/>Final rating: 9/10, it is superb but not a timeless masterpiece."

Taxi Driver was a commercial success, and that can be based majorly on the good work done by Martin Scorsese the director. The movie's cinematography is also exceptional, from shots taking from the taxi to the one's of Bickle on the street, it was classic. Scorsese and his cinematographer, Michael Chapman, would fit themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot.<br/><br/>Paul Schrader wrote the movie script; he made Bickle a Vietnam veteran because trauma of the war blended perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis.<br/><br/>Taxi follows the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) who works the nightshift, driving his cab throughout New York City.

","Taxi Driver brought three of the most precious gems of cinema into prominence, namely Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese and the then 13 year old Jodie Foster. This 1976 Martin Scorsese psychological thriller takes the viewer into a very different world, away from the candyfloss romances, away from the opulent surroundings, from the big dialogue mouthing mobsters or high school cheerleaders. It takes them into the mind of a frustrated and an unstable person who is becoming dangerously psychotic due to the filth that he sees around him.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is the unlikely protagonist of the film who also serves as the film's narrator. A discharged Vietnam Vet with seemingly no professional or social skills, the 26 year old (the age he gives his employer) finds it almost impossible to adapt back into the society. He takes a job to drive a taxi in New York at night for 12 hour shifts both as a means to combat his insomnia and to give some direction to his empty and lonely life. His only activities other than driving the taxi are maintaining a diary (which is the narration of the film), watching pornographic films in seedy theatres and writing letters to his parents in which he blatantly lies about working with the secret service and being on important missions all the time. <br/><br/>He gets infatuated with a campaign volunteer Betsy (Cybil Shepard) and asks her out. He later takes her on a date and being socially inept, takes her to one of his frequented seedy theatres. She leaves offended and breaks off all contact with him. His attempts to reconcile with her end in his humiliation at her office which make him further shun himself from society. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, instead of calming him down, driving the taxi at late nights makes his mental condition worse as, owing to the odd hours , he sees the worst elements of the society at work. Most of his fares during that time too are from the underbelly of the society. His mental instability makes him want to lash out at the decadence that he sees around him. He buys guns and starts intense physical training for someday that perceives that he might have to fight the evil that he hates so much. One night, a twelve year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) gets into his cab and pleads him to help her get away, only to have her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) pull her out and throw a crumpled note on the backseat. Travis tracks Iris down by posing as her client only to discover to his dismay that she is very content with her life as a prostitute and has no intent of returning to her family. She says that she was stoned on the day when she tried to escape her pimp/lover.<br/><br/>This breaks down any remaining sanity in Travis and saving Iris from this wretched life becomes his sole obsession. He loses all sanity, even trying to make a ridiculous attempt on the life of the presidential candidate (from which he barely escapes) for whom his former love interest Betsy is campaigning. Finally, he decides in the end to save Iris at any cost, paving way for a devastating climax. <br/><br/>Even after more than three decades of being made, this film remains the most harrowing portrayal of an unstable mind. Martin Scorsese pours his brilliance into the script in which the dialogues are the farthest thing from eloquent or flowery yet hard hitting. The film is painfully real and not for a moment is the viewer given any false hopes that things are going to get better and something good will surely come out in the end. The viewer knows the end cannot be any better and sadly goes with this unlikely protagonist on his march to the abyss. This film is rated highly by any director today worth his salt and remains an inspiration for any film student today who wants to make it big.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro's portrayal of Travis Bickle is superlatively brilliant. Much has been written about it and all I can add is that it's a privilege to watch him live this role. He makes you feel disgusted, afraid, sympathetic and sorry for Travis all at the same time, because the viewer realizes that he too unknowingly wants to lash out at the evil all around him. Being a method actor, DeNiro drove a taxi in New York for a month for long hours in order to become Travis Bickle, instead of merely playing the role. The result is for all of us to see. Jodie Foster's portrayal of the twelve year old drug addict hooker Iris is disturbingly awesome. The scene of her first meeting with Travis where she tells him that he's got only fifteen minutes to do his thing is definitely not for someone raised on goody goody cinema.The rest of the supporting cast is effective as well, Harvey Keitel being remarkable as Sport. <br/><br/>The fact that Robert de Niro, Jodie Foster and Martin Scorsese did not win the Oscar for their performance or Taxi Driver didn't win the best picture again proves that awards don't go to the best films most of the times. Rarely does a film come which takes the viewers out of their comfort zone and make them see cinema for what it is, a fulfilling art and science instead of merely being a medium of entertainment. But when it does, you should not miss it. This timeless classic is applicable today as much as it was in the 70s, simply for the fact as its caption states that in every street in every city in the world, there is a nobody waiting to be a somebody."

","Taxi Driver Taxi Driver directed by Martin Scorsese is a mind-blowing piece of art that emphasizes on human interrelations and justice use. When I saw this film, I was blown-away by Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickles. The character, Travis Bickles is a loner with psychic problems especially insomnia, and a personality disorder. We have also learned that he is honorably discharged Vietnam veteran. He is a night-shift taxi driver who fails to make a connection with society since everyone is impersonal and cruel to others. The people treat him as an invisible being. In addition, the streets of New York City are corrupted, dirty, and immoral. Travis mentions that he wants someone to clean up the city's corruptness, and votes for the leading candidate for president. Later in the movie, when his girl of dreams, Becky dumps him for the way he acts to her because he thought that Becky was an ""angel"" compare to the dirty citizens of New York and thought that no one should hurt her, but he was wrong. Therefore, he decides to takes revenge on Becky by trying to assassinate the leading candidate for president, which Becky supports largely. Travis arms himself with weapons supplied from a black market, and shaves off his hair on his head. Yet, his assassination plan fails. Thus, he tries to find another way to release his anger by becoming a vigilante. As the film progresses, we begin to learn that Travis has a loath for prostitution, and he begins protecting an underage girl, Iris (played by Jodie Foster) from her abusive lover, ""Sport."" When Iris repudiates Travis's help, Travis becomes infuriated, and uses his anger to attack ""Sport"" and the gangsters in a bloody shoot-out. Eventually, he gets shot, but prevails by killing ""Sport."" At that point, Travis is ultimately claimed as a hero in society when he saves Iris. It is ironic because in the beginning of the movie, he followed the laws of society and acted ""invisible"" to others. However, when he breaks society's laws, he becomes a hero which seems to help him to escape his miserable fate in life. That is one of the themes of the movie: glorification of violence. People start to care for him. Unfortunately, in the end of the film, one can never know if Travis actually died or lived because everyone has their own interpretations. I would say that Travis's triumph is actually a tragedy since we don't know the impossible answers to the questions. He might have died because at the end, it was almost like a dream sequence that played on an emotional level, but we still do not know. The ending is supposed to be enigmatic. Martin Scorsese ended this film that way with no real answers for the ending because the director made the audience cared for Travis Bickles. We wanted to know what really happened to him, so that teaches us a very significant lesson about life. The moral of the film in my opinion was that if humans were impersonal, unfair, and unloving to others, society would deteriorate and fall into chaos in life. Another reason I enjoyed this masterpiece for the reason that it was very gritty, and realistic to the 1970s of New York City. In general, Taxi Driver is a must-see for people who love heavy dramas."
"UnknownRealmsDotNet","9","0","0","22 July 2012"," Scorsese's break out film is a classic!
","Taxi Driver is Scorsese's breakout film. It is dark, visceral and haunting. Only his fourth film, this classic bears all the marks of a seasoned auteur. Intricately crafted shots, perfect timing, and on top of that, De Niro gives one of his most disturbing performances. Together they paint a portrait of a man slipping into insanity and his personal self-destructive fantasy. That said, I don't believe this film is as insightful as everyone says it is. I've seen in three times now and I can't understand it's 'purpose.' What is the point of this? Is Travis a representation of the angst filled youth (of the 70's era) -- wanting to change the world, but misguided in how they try? Is this a portrait of how isolation destroys a man? Is this a tragedy? But these ideas aren't overtly clear. Especially by the happy ending (how he is somehow turned into a hero). Only after watching documentaries with interviews with the creators did I understand their intentions with certain scenes. But like most creators, the writer/director here were so close to their art that they thought what they were doing was self-evident (when sometimes it wasn't.) The character Travis himself is not sympathetic, while even anti-heroes have some part of them that you can connect with, some part that makes you want to root for them. Maybe that's why it works. Taxi Driver is an unfiltered look at New York in the 70's. Most of the film captures this in such detail and finesse, it couldn't have been staged better (which many of the background shots weren't). And Travis is a dark portrait of a reject on the edge, pushed over by the madness of the city/society/humanity(whatever you want to call it), and this story has proved itself to be reality again and again since. This is a mark of accurate art. Maybe that is what Taxi Driver is."

","My first outing into the world of Martin Scorsese, and while now i have seen many Scorsese films, 'taxi driver' remains my favorite due to the haunting imprint it has left on me. This film is undeniably the most powerful, disconcerting and poignant character study of the fragility of the human condition from the forms of alienation in an urbanized landscape.<br/><br/>The plot examines a veteran from the Vietnam war and his attempts to find solace in the Saviour of a prostitute.<br/><br/>The most notable area of where 'taxi driver' succeeds is from the sublime direction of martin Scorsese, who establishes the camera as a window into Travis subconscious, which allows Scorsese to convey Travis emotions visual rather than aurally. For instance, the harrowing scene when Travis meets the gun dealer, the camera establishes Travis gaze as he positions the gun towards the window and takes aim at society, which evokes his thoughts of ""Some day a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets"". Also the sequence where wizard is creating small talk and the camera is again used in POV style to establish Travis view which is fixated on a glass of water which symbolically highlights Travis emotions. Scorsese also establishes his audacious direction with some great innovative, authentic shots, for instance when Travis is talking into an endless conversation on the phone and the camera slowly moves from Travis position on the phone to the emptiness of the hallway. This shot (imo) is audacious film-making at it's best, Scorsese boldness in breaking the traditional camera movements to create a brilliant ambiguous sequence.<br/><br/>Besides Scorsese sublime direction, Robert De niro is riveting as the tormented Travis bickle, conveying effortlessly the parallel dimensions of a Psychotic but still capable of demanding sympathy, for instance when Travis attempts to find a connection in talking to the adult-theater clerk and his oblivious nature in taking Betsy to the theater, he is surrounded by alienation to the extent that he can't access the proper methods of socializing. <br/><br/>Furthermore Bernard Hermann score is another technique which broadens the window for the audiences to enter Travis psychological state, the music conveys a sense of poignancy while simultaneously being disturbing.<br/><br/>Like '2001' the ending of 'taxi driver' is brilliantly ambiguous, offering audience a divided opinion, was it just a dream or an ironic statement on the nature of the media?, either way you interpreted the ending, the mood is still disconcerting.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese 'taxi driver' is a disturbing tale of alienation in a nightmarish urbanized landscape. The film will be forever encapsulated into the 'all-time greats' because simply there is no other film that captures a character study of the fragments of the human mind as powerful as this."

","Starring Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel. We gradually realize a Vietnam war veteran (Travis/DeNiro) is becoming increasingly mentally unstable (& with what now might be called PTSD?). <br/><br/>Travis is a night-time taxi driver in New York City. The flagrant prostitution and other decadence he sees around him feeds his urge to violently lash out & he attempts to rescue a young teenage prostitute (Iris/Foster) in his reactive process. <br/><br/>In addition to being in IMDb's top 250, it's also a Roger Ebert ""Great Movie."" He said, ""(it's)....one of the best and most powerful of all films....(and it) does not grow dated or over-familiar""<br/><br/>IMO, all its psychological dynamics are absolutely true to life. The ending has two possible interpretations--one literal, the other's just the last fancy of the injured or dying central character. Scorsese intended the literal view but probably more viewers (as I do) favor the second. Your choice.<br/><br/>There's much of interest we never see--e.g., why Travis developed as he did--but that only increases our fascination. Was he also only a tad mentally unstable as a teenager but his combat experience/PTSD exacerbated this? Or did he seem completely normal and this is the onset of a schizophrenic reaction which typically emerges in this age range? What were his parents and upbringing and teenage socializing like? Etc., etc. The narrative we follow comfortably fits a number of very plausible preceding possibilities.<br/><br/>Most people can read in advance Roger Ebert's reviews of this film and not ruin their enjoyment at all (and may even add to it as it did for me; (of his 3 reviews, I most like the last one he did for his ""Great Movies"")."

Why was he so mad at Betsy for not calling him back? He's a cabby, she works for a Senator and gave him a chance. He took her to a porn theater on their first date which disgusted her, really Travis? What was the point of that bit with Scorsese in the Taxi, seemed pointless, any man would react that way if his wife was screwing around? Why did Travis seem to enjoy the Senator but then go back to shoot him? Why did Travis think it was better for Iris to leave that filthy place and go back home to her folks, but he didn't think it was best for him to do the same, instead he lied to his parents in the card he wrote about how he's working for the govt and he cant go back to them, what great life does he have? What was with that sudden Mohawk, he only had that do for like 15minutes of the entire movie, pointless? Had many more questions throughout the movie, but can't remember them now. It was interesting, but too many contradictions, seemed like Travis was suffering from some serious mental illness (schizophrenia mixed with bipolar), don't think I have any desire to rent this movie again.

","Taxi driver is a cinematic masterpiece ever made,including impeccable screenplay,incredible directing and excellent plot, acting. Travis played by Robert DeNiro ,who is one of the most famous actors, shows talent through vivid performances. At first,I deem the movie is some kind of an enigma,revealing a man full of loneliness suffering from insomnia. In order to fill his emptiness,Travis toils for 10 hours or above in the cab . Just like cabbie Max Durocher (Jamie Foxx) in Collateral(2004) who deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service,both are cabbie and drive the taxi purposelessly,or just earn a living.<br/><br/>Regarding Travis,he is an an ex-Marine middle-aged man and become more eccentric when falling in love with Betsy, a worker on the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palatine. She plays an important role in highlighting Travis's utter alienation from society,along with disappointment with the words by the Senator. He does something odd that save twelve-year-old prostitute,Iris. Even though his intention(bail her out of peril) is appreciative,can he kill so-called 'scum' violently and unlawfully ? And then he is hailed as a hero fighting against the gang.I really doubt that this social mind. Everyone has flaws regardless of your race,nations,social status and loneliness. We should give a chance for those who go astray to engage themselves in self-reflection. Yes,we might despise the scum but cannot kill them.There are alternatives.<br/><br/>Another important point is that disaffected mind is of paramount importance in today's world. But,hardly can we observe this valuable behavior in the world,especially in China. Take 'YueYue incident' in 2011 as an example,social moral degrades and hearts are corroded. We need Travis's disaffected mind and appreciative attitude towards our society and world."

"Artimidor","9","0","0","30 April 2012"," Existentialistic abyss in downtown New York
","""Taxi Driver"" is the classic picture that put the combination Scorsese plus DeNiro and as an extra Jodie Foster seriously on the map - all in one go. Supported by Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle and accompanied by one of the last of Bernhard Hermann's brilliant scores the movie struck a nerve in the audience of the Seventies and paved the way for more explicit violence to come to the silver screen in the following decades. Which is not a good thing in itself, but an inevitability with ""Taxi Driver"" at the forefront. However, the outstanding performance of DeNiro and the painstaking perfectionism of Scorcese's direction make a psychotic taxi driver's prowling through New York's underground on the edge of reality absolutely worthwhile.<br/><br/>According to screenwriter Paul Schrader his script was influenced by French existentialism, particularly its primary representatives Sartre and Camus. Indeed, the plot of Camus' novel ""L'Etranger"" (""The Outsider"") parallels the movie in key points - loneliness, isolation and estrangement of the protagonist are enforced by the absurdity of the world around the protagonist and lead to a deadly outcome. The alienation Camus defined as an existential category, Schrader transfers to the urban jungle of NY. While hinting at a Vietnam trauma taxi driver Travis Bickle might be suffering from, this background is never actually explored, thus providing ample opportunity for the viewer to connect with the character. As such ""Taxi Driver"" is more than a movie about a madman. It is a thought-provoking and dangerous look into the abyss that lurks beneath skyscrapers and into our souls, a place where only we ourselves can answer."
"screenman","8","0","0","25 March 2012"," Creeping Madness
","A comparatively youthful Robert DeNiro plays lead in the role that might be said to have 'made' him.<br/><br/>He is Travis Bickle, a former Vietnam marine turned misfit. Unable to sleep, he resorts to nocturnal taxi-driving in New York. As a character in decline, he is almost a classic example and maybe even voice for all of those similar loners who gradually lapse into psychosis, only to impact upon public consciousness when they decide to correct what's wrong in the world instead of what's wrong in their heads. <br/><br/>Bickle has all of the symptoms. He lives in squalor, he's obsessed with physical fitness, he's a gun-freak, he can't make it with women, and all he sees is depravity. But he has a Walter Mitty complex, with preposterous fantasies about himself and some personal destiny for which fate is grooming him. A week never seems to pass when we don't read about just such a case in the papers, with all of the tragic consequences.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is inevitably filmed at night with harsh contrasts of darkness and artificial illumination. People and places are imperfectly seen. Sometimes just a flash of expression or a vignette of drama is all we glimpse and must infer the rest, even as Travis Bickle does. Scorsese has worked hard to present nocturnal New York as a sort of hell-on-earth, a breeding-ground for anger, resentment, disappointment and distempered fantasy. Though it's really no different from most major cities today.<br/><br/>Like so many people of his stamp, Bickle accumulates an arsenal of guns. At one point, whilst shopping, he interrupts a robbery and shoots - perhaps fatally - the young black culprit. We never know. He departs leaving the furious shop-keeper beating the prostrate robber's body with a baseball bat.<br/><br/>At last, in an attempt to 'be somebody' he attempts to rescue a young whore. In the course of it he takes his arsenal and enters the tenement brothel. Without ceremony he begins shooting. It's violent and bloody.<br/><br/>But Scorsese clumsily attempts to rescue the fat from the fire. Towards the end, we see a series of newspaper cuttings in which the media have depicted Bickle as some 'hero', engaged in a shoot-out with mobsters. Finally, we encounter him in his cab once more, seemingly balanced and peaceable. It's a highly implausible caricature. The media have often shown themselves to be very quick at pre-judging heroes and villains, but truth eventually comes out. The police could hardly have failed to determine from his handprints on the discarded (and unlicensed) firearms as well as the various holsters and knife-sheath on his person, that they were dealing with a vigilante. The young hooker may have spoken in his favour, but the evidence would've made it pretty clear that he went to the premises tooled-up for serious trouble. As the girl was still a minor, he could and should have just called the police. <br/><br/>It's still a very engaging analysis of an outsider on the skids even so."

","""Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets"". A quote said displeased by taxi driver Travis Bickle, a role portrayed very intensely by Robert De Niro in one of his first main roles in a Martin Scorsese film. Brickle's work takes him through New York and gives a sleepless look in the heart of the city, especially in all the dark alleys were most people don't know anything about. But he is so blunted by the world that he feels deaf-mute, invisible and very powerless. <br/><br/>Though, Bickle is not very angry about the social and physical decay around him because he does not know better. He is also in a conflict with himself, attracted by things that loathe him. Sick because of himself and all the things he sees, he decides to do one last attempt to return to society. But there is no escape in Paul Schraders' gloomy, held-on-earth scenario.<br/><br/>Bickle's downfall is very painful to see, and later on tragic and nerve-racking. He tries to befriend the beautiful campaign co-worker, Betsy (portrayed by Cybill Shepherd). When his unhandy convergence problems are rejected, his alienation becomes more powerful. Although he wanted to return to society, his new plans, now, are to destroy it. He plans an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate. Also, when this plan goes wrong, he tries to make it right with society by making a suicide-action with in the process saving the life of a under-aged hooker (portrayed by Jodie Foster) from the hands of a very aggressive pimp. <br/><br/>A very dark, melancholic and claustrophobic portrayal of the metropolitan malaise and lawlessness is the point of Taxi Driver. The film contains elements of film noir - Bickle's voice over, the very oppressive jazzy music by Bernard Herrman - but deviates powerfully from that genre because of the story. It is told from the perspective of an anonymous stranger who, from a distance, witnesses murder. What is going on in the mind the mind of this man? How is he going to react on this confrontation with nauseating violence? Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro seem to ask us the same question. Throughout the entire movie the film enrolls the city in front of our eyes, seen from the isolated and ruthless perspective from Bickle: only a couple of unimportant sparks give us hope of this mad spirit. He is Dostojevski's underground man who rises with a fire weapon and a death wish, a sort of militant anti-hero who takes the chance to clean the city. ""Here is a man who won't take it anymore"", he says triumphantly.<br/><br/>But is this what we want? Eventually Bickle is portrayed as a sort of crusader and it is quite difficult to say if Bickle's triumph isn't a tragedy. Because, the movie is so good in disrupting the moral compass, we keep looking for impossible answers."

","Director Martin Scorsese teams up with Robert De Niro, one of the most intense actors of the time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation. Taxi Driver is one of those films that you never get tired of watching and you always find little more detail that you never noticed before.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is at his best in his role of Travis Bickle, a lonely and disturbed Vietnam veteran who works as a night time taxi driver because he can't sleep at night. He drives around the streets of New York at night; most of the streets he stops are full of junkies and prostitutes which are the main elements of the world where Travis lives. The scenes when you see Travis driving his taxi is shown as if you are seeing the gritty streets of New York and the junkies through his eyes. Travis is a misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says 'loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere' but at the same time he seems to not do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (played by Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema.<br/><br/>Travis gets obsessed with a 12 year old prostitute named Iris (played by Jodie Foster) and at the time it was shocking. Travis wanted to make a difference by convincing Iris to go back home where she should belong.<br/><br/>Travis later on changes his look by cutting his hair to make a Mohawk punk look, he gets on his gun holster and straps up knives with tape and one that he made by himself that puts a gun straight into his hand when he flicks his hand down. It shows in this scene that he is getting prepared to kill someone and the original plan for him was to assassinate a presidential candidate. He attempted to assassinate a presidential candidate that Betsy supported but he got caught putting his hand into his jacket that makes him look like he's getting a gun out so he ran off, later at night he went to where Iris lives and kills all the gangsters and pimps there and gets called a hero by newspapers, if he carried on with his plan to assassinate the candidate he would have been in newspapers as the assassin. The ending has many viewers wonder if the aftermath of the shootout scene is real or a dream because of the camera techniques used there after the shootout as if Travis is dead and his spirit has left his body and looking at what he has done. I believe that he didn't die and the camera technique was used to show what he had done during the shootout; the last scene to me showed that he is going to snap again just like that in the future but only next time, he won't be a hero as said in the newspapers. Scorsese has made a great ending to this film because it makes the viewer think and decide what happened after the shootout even though Scorsese himself claimed that Travis lives at the end.<br/><br/>The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by the late great jazz composer Bernard Herrmann who composed the music for many classics such as Psycho and Cape Fear.<br/><br/>I give this film 10 out of 10 because in my honest opinion, everything about this film is absolutely brilliant. The acting, cinematography, locations, soundtrack and plot goes perfectly together and created one of the greatest movies ever made. That is obviously why Martin Scorsese later worked with Robert De Niro again in other movies that are also considered classics like Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Casino. There has never been a film quite like Taxi Driver before 1976 and looking at the films these days which includes CGI filled blockbusters like Harry Potter and Twilight that always invaded the cinemas every year, I don't think there might not be a movie quite like this again."

","This seems like a crime-fighting vigilante movie to me. In it, we see how a mentally unstable veteran, played by Robert DeNiro, gradually deteriorates to an out of control vigilante who is fed up with the problems of society and decides to take matters into his own hands. The plot is filled with tension and action. This, along with its setting, the rough streets of New York with prostitutes and criminals, makes for an interesting story. I enjoyed DeNiro's performance as the increasingly out of control Travis, as well as Jodie Foster's performance as Iris, the child prostitute he decides to save. I liked the scene towards the ending where DeNiro made his way through the apartment building battling all of the thugs trying to save Iris.

Hes a wanderer who slinks around the cities underbelly observing but not participating. It's strange to see a character surrounded by filth but not indulging in it, the director must have been a genius to have De Niro act the way he dose like hes moving with out purpose until he meets the prostitute at which time it seems the cinematographer chose to darken the movie to make it a little more suspenseful."

Travis presents us a frame of post war American society with crimes, prostitution, drugs, gangsters, social collapse, and much more. Travis does not belong to that society at first; because he is not a part of crimes, he is only a social observer.<br/><br/>His confrontation with senator reveals that only Travis is aware of the dirty smell of streets, as seen on the face of senator who seems to hear that complaint first time in his life. The second part of the movie is transition to action. Our main character prefers to be 'into frame' rather than 'out of frame'. Travis saves Money, buys guns, changes hairstyle, and prefers to clean the dirt on his own. Here presented two different faces of Travis: one is a nice guy with modest smile, alone and isolated from society; other is illegal, murderer, and part of that society. Ironically, he becomes a 'hero' after he becomes a 'murderer'. What marks you as a nice person in society is something illegal and corrupt, is not that a social message of Martin Scorsese?"

","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) has become one of the most iconic characters in the movies during the 1970's. Even after three and a half decades, people of all ages get jittery even after watching and just can't get enough of the brilliant performances by the cast and the dynamic directing job of Martin Scorsese. What makes this film really special is that it defines antiheroes that are not intended to likable but intimidated. But at the same time you just get entranced by the charisma of De Niro's performance you have no other alternative but to admire this psychologically scarred Vietnam vet Travis Bickle. <br/><br/>Bickle is a decorated war veteran who finds himself working as a New York City taxi driver as a way to make money and to keep in touch with the outside world. Bickle is a social outcast, even though customers are just a seat him he's still alienated from them. His self-alienation comes to the point that even looking through the mirror, he can't even identify his own reflection. But this is because that's the way he chooses to be because the rage inside of him manifests within him as the inner scars from Vietnam are still with him and may linger with him till the day he dies. <br/><br/>He finds the love of two women that are woefully mismatched with this walking time-bomb. One of the women is named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who's a campaign manager geared to elect a new President. She out of better judgement voluntarily obliges to go out with him, but surely regretted it when he took her to see an X-rated movie. But Bickle was not seeing the raunchy movie because he's a pervert, but because he's trying to rectify his humanity that's been absent from his war days. The other girl he's smitten for is the preteen hooker named Iris (Jodie Foster) as he defines sex as a symbolic synonym for inner rage as he defends her against her pimp (Harvey Keitel). He believes she's crying for his help, when in reality, she's chosen this life for herself. <br/><br/>As the days go by, Bickle's inner rage takes its turn for the worst as he decides to eject himself from getting in touch with reality and has decided to bring some people down. One of the first targets is the Presidential hopeful that Betsy is campaigning for. When that didn't work out like he anticipated, he decides to go after Iris' pimp daddy. After the carnage is done, we can see the power of what De Niro, Scorsese, Paul Schrader and even Mr. Bickle himself is getting at. <br/><br/>De Niro gives a whole new and original concept of sexual aggression as being both grotesque but understand through the eyes of Bickle. He wants to take that aggression to other people, when in fact, the only person he's appalled with is himself. He has an unintentional misunderstanding of what love is all about. He wants to make people's life a living hell, but can't control the inner demons so he takes them down with him. And it's all explained by the famous talking to himself in the mirror. To him, he thinks he's pointing a gun at someone, but in reality he's unconsciously pointing a gun at his reflection.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese was at the top of his game in the 1970's as ""Taxi Driver"" was the film that made Scorsese a household name. The opening shot kind of reminds me of the opening for the 1977 equally successful film ""Star Wars"" with the big yellow cab moving off-left. The inner demons depicted in ""Taxi Driver"" can stem from two possibilities. It could be from loneliness, alienation or just a way to prove you're right when the whole world thinks you're not. That may explain why Bickle decided to break ties with humanity."

","By the time Martin Scorsese made ""Taxi Driver"" he'd already achieved a certain measure of critical & commercial success with his two previous pictures, ""Mean Streets"" & ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"". However, these were soon to be dwarfed by the impact of this seminal film.<br/><br/>The story doesn't lend itself to easy categorization. In a nutshell, it concerns a New York City cab driver (Robert De Niro) who is plagued by loneliness. Brooding on the sorry state of his city he begins to lose his grip on sanity and fantasizes about lashing out violently.<br/><br/>This is one of De Niro's greatest performances, meaning that it's also one of the greatest movie performances, period. He was justly rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his efforts, though he ended up losing. A young Jodie Foster also picked up the first Oscar nomination of her career for her performance in a supporting role. Besides these two there are several other notable individuals including Peter Boyle, Harvey Keitel, Cybill Shepherd & Albert Brooks.<br/><br/>Paul Shrader's screenplay and Martin Scorsese's direction create a potent combination. The story has a feeling of authenticity and Scorsese brings it to life with a combination of documentary realism and deft camera-work. Naturally, much credit for the film's look should also go to cinematographer Michael Chapman. Incredibly, all three of these individuals were left out of the Oscar race. Bernard Hermann, on the other hand, received a posthumous nomination for his evocative score.<br/><br/>While I think that the plot loses a bit of focus in the later stages it soon regains its composure and ends on an indisputable high note. Even after 35 years, ""Taxi Driver"" remains powerful; if anything, it's only grown in stature among movie audiences. Thus, I highly recommend it to any lover of films past or present."

As Travis sees much of the city during his late hours and longs shifts, he becomes disgusted with the 'scum' that live and operate in it. This provokes Travis' to commit a violent act and he is driven to the edge of sanity. He plots to assassinate a senator and rescue a young prostitute.<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>Only truly special films win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and 'Taxi Driver' is without doubt a truly special film.<br/><br/>De Niro's performance and portrayal of Travis is frighteningly realistic, I had to keep reassuring myself that it was De Niro and not some nut job taxi driver that Scorsese had simply went out and found. We will watch in awe as he portrays a man who puts his words into actions and responds to the 'scum' who feed his need for violence. De Niro pulls out all the stops to give a spectacular and disturbing performance and one that will live long in the memory. <br/><br/>The character Travis Bickle is without a doubt one of the most amazing, interesting characters ever to grace cinema. Travis as a character will leave you speechless. He has 'bad ideas' that are revealed to the audience more as the film progresses, he gradually becomes obsessed with killing Senator Pallantyne and saving a a young prostitute. His increasingly worrying diary entries point to the direction of violence, which prepares the audience for something significant and presents an imminent danger. But its the little things about Travis that will stay in your mind, his tough guy persona when he's alone with his gun, and his memorable lines such as 'You Talking To Me!'. Sure we know Travis is a strange person from the beginning as he doesn't seem to visit a porn cinema for pleasure and he speaks rather openly to Betsy on their first date, referring to the 'connection' between the two although they have just met. However we overlook this due to his likability, as does Betsy. We see though that his fantasies become realities, somewhat unsurprisingly however as Travis speaks early on about his desire to 'clean up the scum' and as we watch his actions during the climax, we know that Travis go down as one of the greatest characters in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The film is about isolation in a society full of wrongdoings and crime. Travis is a very lonely and isolated character and we learn this from the beginning of the film. His only attempt to achieve company goes to no avail as he takes Betsy to a porn film and she is appalled, further strengthening a viewers perception that Travis is detached from society and the 'scum' that are a part of it, he lives amongst his fantasies of violence and we learn early on that he is a troubled and unstable individual, however his attempt to achieve a form of stability and company through Betsy collapses and Travis tells her 'you're in hell, and you're gonna die in hell like the rest of em' this 'hell' as he calls it is simply society, and the isolation of himself from this city of 'scum'. He sees Betsy as something different at first, but then he views her in the same light as everyone else after she doesn't take his calls for quite obvious and understandable reasons. This could be seen as Travis living in a fantasy world rather than real life, and his loneliness is fuelled by his detachment from real life, his perception of the city may be because he does not view everyone in his own image although Travis is far from perfect and we see this in many instances in the film hence the reason Travis could be seen as responsible for his own loneliness and isolation. However the fact that Travis puts his words into actions may disclaim this and show that he is the anti- hero of the film who is an anomaly in a distasteful city and his loneliness is in fact understandable and Travis Bickle may be misunderstood by many, by saving Iris this presents Travis as different to the rest, he tries to stand up and be counted for at the end of the film and could be viewed as the good guy who uses 'true force' to revolt against a differing city. Is Travis to blame for his isolation and detachment? it is debatable but the themes of loneliness, detachment and isolation are a significant inclusion by Scorsese and Schrader's script certainly highlights these debatable but fascinating themes.<br/><br/>The film is expertly executed and some of the inclusions and scenes are amazingly directed. The music by Bernard Herrmann that plays during the start of the film is seductive but has a catastrophic quality and Scorsese's choice of cinematographer Michael Chapmann is also ideal, his lighting and camera choices contribute towards a brilliant film. Scorsese has perfected the memorable scenes, Travis standing in front of the mirror trying out his guns, Travis bursting into the brothel bearing a psychotic grin and wielding handguns subsequently massacring pimps and clients. The way Scorsese has used dialogue creates moods that are fascinating for a watching audience. The fact that Scorsese brought in De Niro earns merit, he tops off a complete trio of Schrader, Scorsese and De Niro that works perfectly together.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' is one of those films that will stay with you forever, its something truly special. The all round fantastic acting, the directors inclusions and Schrader's script make an all round sublime film that you will never forget. Simply stunning!"

","The Taxi driver is a masterpiece. It has many of the film noir elements mixed with a deep social commentary. Its no wonder why this movie is so great given its pedigree (Scorsese, Sharader, De Niro, Keitel, Foster). It keeps a good pace and is very engaging. De Niro plays Travis in such a brilliant way. Although you know Travis is a weird guy, you immediately like him. You want to root for him because he doesn't like all the bad that he sees in the world. And you begin to feel for him, because he is helpless to make any change and he feels alienated by the world. Travis is by far, my favorite anti-hero.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did another fabulous job showcasing 1970's NYC which was considerably dirty and rundown at this time. The end scene, after Travis puts his finger to his head and pulls the trigger, is particularly haunting as the camera pans overhead and slowly back down the hall and into the street.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a masterpiece and is a must see."

","A few years back, as i perused the aisles of HMV for quality DVDs, I encountered the two-disc special edition of Taxi Driver which i didn't then own. On it's sheath was a sticker reading 'One for the Lads'. At first I was disgusted -how could the same people who signify a social realism drama in their Sky Movies Guide with the image of sketch character Vicky Pollard go so far as to spit their heathen phlegm upon the facade of one of the finest films ever made? Recently, I have looked more positively upon their congealed phlegm and realised that they had it right: Taxi Driver certainly ain't one for the lasses. After all, do women really unleash their hatred upon people who've never affected them? Are women ever the ones pulling the triggers behind the American high school massacres. No. I believe HMV really nailed male psychology on that one. Well done, guys!<br/><br/>Anyhow, on with the review... Travis Bickle is sick of ""the days go(ing) on and on with regularity"" in his cab and wants to ""become a person like other people"". This means picking up another not-quite-so-lonely heart in the form of angelic campaign worker Betsy and taking her out to see a porno for a first date. When she surprisingly walks out on him and hails a cab ride home (a real arrow in the heart for any cabbie), he is astonished. Bickle's emotional dysfunction is also evident in the banal conversations he has with his fellow cabbies at their Belmore Cafeteria hangout. He's someone who never quite belonged, probably feeling even more distant upon his return from military service in Nam , or ""f*ckin' Mau Mau land"" as father figure and fellow disenchanted cabbie Wizard calls it. <br/><br/>""You get a job. You become the job,"" Wizard tells him after Travis cryptically expresses his fear that his repressed urges to kill as he did in Vietnam will explode sometime soon. Travis Bickle is a Taxi Driver, more than a son, a brother, an ex-boyfriend or anything else. His life rotates around his twelve-hour shifts and inability to sleep. Director Scorsese plays the 'Man in Cab' or herald of things to come who maniacally describes what he will do to an ex-girlfriend's pudenda with a 44. Magnum. The scene that follows is a brilliantly subjective one in which Travis heads to the Belmore Cafeteria for the aforementioned useless advice he receives from Peter Boyle's Wizard character. It is shot in such a tense way, as with the rest of the movie from TB's perspective, as to evoke a feeling of imminent violence. In other words, the quick cuts and tight shots of ticket dispensers and slo-mo hacky looks of Travis suggest he is gonna unload his inner demons right there in the cafeteria.<br/><br/>Of course, he doesn't start killing people midway through the movie, but canny soon he's buying guns and ammo from seedy street dealers in grimy hotel rooms and getting the infamous Mohawk haircut as he plots his revenge on a world which never quite accepted him like it did the Senator Palantines or corner pimps like Matthew (aka 'Sport'). His is not simply a mission of vengeance though, as he aims to rescue 12-and -a-half prostitute Iris from the clutches of her loving-but-business-minded manager Sport. In the end, our homicidal protagonist is dubbed a hero by the media, or is it just his dying fantasy?<br/><br/>The debate over whether Travis actually succeeds in killing himself along with all of his victims rages on. Certainly the ending in which an expressionless Betsy is escorted home by an apparently unchanged Travis is very ethereal and would seem the perfectly unimaginative wordless fantasy of a dying loner like Bickle. The tracking shot from the blood-drenched stairwell into the street would even suggest the departure of Travis's soul, but the attention to detail on the newspapers and the filmmaker's own comments would suggest the opposite. <br/><br/>A sequel following a 21st century Bickle around a Giulianian post-9/11 New York is supposedly in the works. One can only imagine Travis being diagnosed as Autistic and being assigned a carer who he becomes obsessed with, but goes on a rampage against the PC hordes and capitalist demagogues in Manhattan when she rejects him. Perhaps the climactic shootout will occur on the steps of Wall Street where Bickle takes out his aggression upon the demon bankers who he blames for the loss of his job. Maybe he'll get a mullet this time. Or he could just get a facebook account and p*ss away his solitary existence there. Whatever they decide to do, it'll be interesting to see the patron Saint of Loneliness return..."

","TAXI DRIVER is a late 70's film is timeless. The soundtrack may not have any similarities in today's movies, but the values that are present are universal. The loneliness of the main character, the wrongs of the world, the alienation of modern life is all present in this masterpiece of a movie. By the presentation of the main character, it avoids all the usual clichés of cinema, which is a relief. The city that is portrayed in this film is one that is decaying, one that is covered by filth and dirtiness. The film's main appeal is its focus on the human desires, such as trying to find purity in impurity. This is evident in Bickle's (played very well by Robert De Niro) interest in Betsey. The ending of the film is one of a masterpiece, with well done shots, memorable lines. It's gusts is something to be admired, that when doing with a subject matter such as drugs, prostitution it should be met with grit and realism as opposed to gloss. It will forever be a universal film, not because of the performances or script (which did help), but the universal themes and Martin Scorsese's uncompromising directing style. A must see film."

","Martin Scorsese IS an artist. Anyone who says otherwise has no right to call themselves a fan of cinema. And Taxi Driver, is certainly one of his best ever movies, if not the best. Personally, my favourite Scorsese film is raging bull. However, you would be standing on very firm ground to argue that Taxi Driver was the better film.<br/><br/>First of all, De Niro probably gives his career performance. It is certainly his most iconic. He plays Travis, a troubled ex-marine who is suffering from insomnia and decides to take a job as a late night taxi driver. From the moment we see him, it is instantly clear that although he is present, there is a sinister atmosphere that shows that Travis is simply not there. He clearly is somehow mentally unstable. He isn't your average guy. He becomes easily obsessed, and becomes very troubled by very small things. So when he becomes completely infatuated with Betsy, who works for a presidential candidate. He also acquires the strange habit of going to view porn films in the cinema. He doesn't enjoy them, but he is rather fascinated by them.<br/><br/>So, as you can see, this is one psycho weirdo that would even send Jack Nicholson running for the hills. It required an exceptional actor to rise to the challenge of playing such a complex and emotional character. Que. young Robert De Niro. Who would have ever thought that one of cinemas greatest ever talents was so finely suited to the screen from such a young age. Like I said, his best ever performance. It is still baffling to me as to how he didn't win the academy award. They clearly have no idea what they are talking about. Actually, the film also deserved the academy award.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do an excellent job. Jodie Foster too stands out as a young talent. She is one of my personal favourite actresses, and she shone from a very young age. Harvey Keitel also stands out as a good young talent. It's like seeing all our favourite modern stars before they were mega stars. Keitel plays the absolute scum of the earth. He is completely sick, arrogant, sleazy, vile little s***. He deserved the academy award for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>So all in all, this is arguably the best film of the seventies (which automatically makes it arguably the best ever film since the godfather one and two are from the seventies.) It amazes me that Scorsese made this into one of the best of the 70's, He made raging bull which is hands down the best film of the 80's and goodfellas which again is arguably the best film of the 90's. AND he made the departed, probably the best film of the 21st century so far.<br/><br/>But I still can't figure out why it's called Taxi Driver (Just Kidding) ;)"

","First of all, Robert De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle blew me away. His portrayal of how loneliness and alienation can affect one's outlook on life is believable. An average happy person may think a person like Bickle is crazy, but this character is so relateable in so many aspects. From his tired voice to his emotionless eyes, it really gives a good view of how isolation in his life has worn him down. When you are isolated and alone, one has more time to develop a philosophy on different things, but at the same time boredom and redundancy can really take a toll on a person's mind. Everything about his portrayal of this character is iconic and memorable.<br/><br/>As a taxi driver, we see the world from Travis's eyes. As the film progresses, Travis becomes more and more engrossed in changing things around in the city, as we see him being immersed in the ugliness of the criminal underworld and how much of the city is infested with it. This psychologically affects Travis more into becoming radical and it seems to be offset after Travis fails to develop a sense of normalcy with social relationships and trying to connect to someone. And as a human being, what is astounding to me, is that I could relate to all of this.<br/><br/>This is an intense film and what further builds upon this is the soundtrack. The use of jazz music really helps to enhance the looming atmosphere of the film. The down beat jazz music really contrasts well with the more ominous music, and what makes it really work is that it perfectly compliments Travis Bickle as a character of contradictions. While some could argue that Travis Bickle is enigmatic, I think the same could be said about everyone else. Aren't we all an enigma to some degree? I think so.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film with a great story that in my opinion makes a big statement. The meaning of what I inherited from all of this is that sometimes we as human beings want to make some sort of statement, but the limited ability of words can sometimes not be enough to express what's eating us away deep down inside.<br/><br/>What Taxi Driver does is not doing what other movies do and that's creating a ""realistic"" view of the world with a dash of fantasy. Happy endings and getting the girl are a big hit and miss in the real world, as cynical as that may sound, and what Taxi Driver does is not only tell a really great story that is bound to make you think, but a really great story that is completely human."

","I'm a bit late. It took many years until I finally got around to seeing this film. I already knew it was a classic and folks I knew told me how brilliant it was. I had wanted to see it for along time but when preparing to watch it I still tried to keep my expectations on an moderate level fearing that it would feel overrated or old. After seeing it I was just like why did I worry? Taxi Driver is perfect.<br/><br/>First the film has aged extremely well. Sure you can see it's been several years but thats not a disadvantage, quite the opposite actually. The look is just perfect to get the right feel of when it is set. The style of the scenes are brilliant and the way the filming is done is just as brilliant. Soundtrack well chosen to set the feel. Some may think it's a slow movie but it is not. The pace at which the story is told is perfectly chosen. Travis Bickle must be one of the most gripping characters ever. Even though the film is under 2h one gets so close to him I really feel the loneliness that drives him to desperation. Is Robert De Niro's portrayal one of the best performances ever? I would say yes, You talking' to me? The other actors are also brilliant, Jodie Foster is incredible. Amazing supporting performances make every character just as important as the story does. The character development is the central thing driving this film. Don't mistake this for an action film because it's not. A very disturbing film but the reasons lie much deeper than visual brutality. The story slowly builds up to something which one might have an idea of what is. Still I sit at total attention to see what will happen next. The ending shootout must be one of the strongest endings I have ever seen. Sad but still hopeful. Short but in a intense way. The way the camera zooms over the scene when the fight is over, genius. The speech from the thank you letter, very emotionally sad. The ending is kind of open to analysis, works great sometimes I can find it frustrating with open endings. Not here, I immediately thought out what I think happened. Someone said it's the kind of movie you watch once, good but not to see many times. I do absolutely NOT agree. Right after the ending I wanted to see it again and again.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is strong, disturbing, thought provoking, sad, interesting and important. It is all here. Martin Scorsese's definitive masterpiece and Robert De Niro best performance. Taxi Driver holds up still today just as incredible as it has always been. One of the greatest ever! 10/10"

","Contrary to what might be the more common assertions that ""Raging Bull"" or ""Goodfellas"" are Scorsese at the top of his game, this earlier outing with De Niro was then, and still remains now, powerful, genuinely dark and startling! The themes you can see in this work are numerous; it is angry and political, it is visceral and controversial, the character study it presents is razor sharp in its precision. De Niro is studied and scary, truly on the edge and taking the audience with him, a perfect anti-hero, and Scorsese drives another knife into the belly of the Hollywood machine with an anti-saccharine vision, which is bold, shocking, and uncensored in a way that may not have been so easy nowadays. A powerful piece of cinema, full of iconic ideas and imagery that are hard to forget"

","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver emerges out of the mist and confusion of American movies during the past half century as a film not just about a lonesome soul searching for redemption, but also a deep and penetrating look at humanity as a whole, pondering our attempts to connect and establish relationships. It is at once both depressing and engrossing. Like its main character, Travis Bickle, it is a walking contradiction.<br/><br/>Travis is one of the great characters of modern American cinema. He is a Vietnam vet, war-torn and psychologically strained, unable to sleep and obsessed with finding the right direction for his life as well as making a difference in the seedy streets of the town he calls home: New York City. Robert De Niro, one of the great modern American actors, gives a quiet, gentle, yet emotionally disturbed performance as he completely embodies every element of Travis. The various voice-overs provide more detail and information into his psychological profile, deepening our understanding and sympathy with him.<br/><br/>Surrounding De Niro are other solid actors such as Harvey Keitel as the conniving pimp Sport, Albert Brooks as a nerdy campaign manager, Cybil Shepherd as the object of Travis' pure affections, and Jodie Foster as a 12 year-old prostitute who becomes the object of Travis' desire to take charge and initiate change. The whole cast is so good, it becomes ridiculous and redundant to praise or discuss them; they are these characters and must be accepted as such.<br/><br/>The real collaboration for this film is that between director Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader, working here for the first but not last time. Schrader's screenplay is partially autobiographical, but also takes many plot points from John Ford's The Searchers, Dostoevsky and many other sources. What Scorsese is able to do in terms of realizing and visualizing these scenes is nothing short of mind-blowing. The opening shot is that of a yellow taxi, emerging like a great beast amidst the steam and fog that clouds the streets of New York like a mysterious forest. Scorsese then emphasizes the film's point of view by giving us extreme closeups of Bickles' eyes. All along, we see all that he does and eventually come to terms with how he sees the world. We sympathize because he's right and because we want him to come to grips with reality.<br/><br/>Almost 35 years later, Taxi Driver remains a purely great American movie experience. The sets are impeccable, the camera-work perfect in how Scorsese allows it to glide across the streets, picking up every sordid detail Travis filters. Finally, the score must be given its due weight, which is nothing short of vital. The great Bernard Herrmann of Hitchcock fame ended his career with this minimalistic score compose entirely of brass with a saxophone solo so bittersweet and direct that it completely encompasses all the feelings of Travis and the atmosphere of the city. It is a great score, perfectly adept to what Herrmann attempted to do. This is always on great films lists, as well as included at the top of Scorsese and De Niro's best work. There's a reason for that: because it is."

","I had seen this classic before which in my view pretty much stabilized director Martin Scorcese's awesome array of films. In this one Robert De Niro in a stellar performance plays Vietnam War vet Travis Bickle who due to being slightly imbalanced (now i know people will be questioning the slightly part) from the war, can't seem to sleep at nights and takes a job as a night cab driver. A lonely trade for a very lonely individual who spends the nights travelling through the scum and filth of New York's seedy underbelly seeing prostitutes, crazed patrons etc. This line of work only feeds Travis's contempt for society slowly driving him into insanity. Along the lines he meets up with a very young Jodie Foster who portrays a young prostitute named Iris. Maybe saving Iris from this wicked world just might make him a hero instead of a vengeful assassin! Stellar casting, great city speak dialogue and a director who has a great insight to the streets of New York combined to make an extraordinary film."

","Taxi Driver was a great movie to watch. It was filled with drama and suspense. Robert De Niro did an amazing job in this film he plays a taxi driver who is tired of seeing crime and decides to take matters into his own hands. There were a lot of good actors in this film such as Jodie Foster who plays a 12-year-old prostitute that De Niro attempts to help throughout the movie. There are some controversial scenes in the movie, which make the movie very intense and very real. This is one of my new favorite movies that Robert De Niro is in.

","This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It delves into the seedy underworld of New York City in the 70's and follows the mental self destruction of a restless cab driver. Robert De Niro is chilling as Travis Bickle, a cab driver who finds the city and its inhabitants to be sickening and slowly begins to plot a plan to do something about it. As a director Scorsese shines. He really creates a world where the viewer can understand the violent and hateful ideas that Travis begins to have. Scorsese also makes a disturbing cameo in the middle of the movie as a troubled man who gets in Travis' cab only to have him stop in front of the apartment that his wife is having an affair in. He then describes to De Niro's character how he is going to kill her by shooting her with a 44 magnum, which is one of the many guns De Niro's character buys later in the film to carry out his ill fated plan. Scorsese ends the film in a way that could be interpreted differently by different people. To some people that last few scenes are either the dying fantasy's of Travis Bickle, yet others interpret it as the ultimate ironic ending where the man who was attempting to commit an act that would cause him to be hated by the public ends up screwing it up only to become a self-less hero who is responsible for saving a 12 year old girl from the hell of prostitution.<br/><br/>My favorite line is when Harvey Kietel's character Sport says ""I used to have a pony, on Coney Island. It got hit by a truck."""

","I felt this movie did a great job portraying New York City during this time period. The movie also did a great job showing just how much war Veterans can suffer after serving their time in the service. Its a harsh reality that most people don't take seriously. Travis had severe sleeping deprivation along with mental issues and I was nervous just watching the movie to see what was going to be his next action. Some of the camera shots that were filmed from the inside of the cab looking out were mysterious looking as well and also had a ""dark side"" to them which added to the mis-en-scene. Another aspect I found that was done very well was the NYC street theme; they were dingy, dirty, full of filth, graffiti, drugs, prostitutes. For as twisted as crazy Travis seemed all he really wanted to do was make the world a better place; but it was for a twisted reason; a girl who wanted nothing to do with him. So does that make him crazy or not?"

","Taxi Driver is a groundbreaking and classic film, showcasing DeNiro's brilliant performance of Travis Bickle which in my opinion tops that of La Motta in Raging Bull. DeNiro plays the ultimate loner and violent psychopath in Taxi Driver, yet he displays enough charisma causing the viewer to care for this unsavory character he portrays. This is a rare feat for an actor to accomplish. Given Paul Schrader's screenplay refrains from resorting to manipulative cliché to generate sympathy for an unsavory main character like Bickle. Robert DeNiro deserved the best actor Academy Award for this film. <br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is immaculate. The ""Late For The Sky"" sequence is a prime example of the depth DeNiro puts into his performance, conveying so much about the character he is playing without saying a single word. Harvey Keitel is very good as Bickle's foil, Sport. Foster is terrific playing a kid who is more wise to the ways of the world than Travis. Taxi Driver is flawless. A Character study of a troubled & lonely individual who feels ignored by society and driven crazy by his surroundings of urban decay. Bickle feels the only way he will ever get noticed by the girl he adores is by becoming a vigilante. This he feels will get Betsy to notice him. Travis feels he is making a difference by cleansing the city of unsavory elements and rescuing a 12 year old prostitute from her pimp, Sport, and his accomplices. The film which was made in 1976 showed a dark underbelly of society in America which still holds true today. More than ever in fact. Taxi Driver is a comment on society. Too often in the news you hear of disturbed and psychologically damaged people who obviously feel leaving their imprint on society through a shocking outburst of violence is the only way to get noticed. <br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann's memorable score fits the mood of the film perfectly. Michael Chapman's cinematography is perfection. The debated controversial ending is open to interpretation. When Bickle is Driving Betsy in the cab. Thus ultimately one of the many brilliant aspects of Taxi Driver, without giving too much away. A thought-provoking and fascinating cinematic experience. Taxi Driver deserves it's well-deserved reputation as a masterpiece. <br/><br/>""He's a walking contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction"". - Kris Kristofferson"

","Travis (De Niro) is always something of a question mark from when we first meet him. He's never predictable in motivation, conversation or deliberation. An intriguing and brilliant character, who'll make you feel like you have the wood to be lit but he'd rather sit there and watch you shiver.<br/><br/>Ironically though this character makes you feel this way through his stony silences - often filled with a narration of thoughts; he detests the filth and scum and deterioration of the city he serves faithfully. An almost pre-Rorschach figure in the smoky mist, or the modern 'goodie' who fights fire with fire in a city full of conflicting flames.<br/><br/>Despite meeting Travis in this uncharismatic surrounding it's characters such as Cybill (Foster) who he meets while gazing in his flamboyantly obvious vehicle, that indicate the real people who need saving, not just the city itself. Controversial though her character (or more precisely her age) may be for such an unheard of role (again for the age) it doesn't take a historian to realise with bad times, comes bad professions and the wrong types of people in those professions.<br/><br/>The blunt but accurate deterioration of a society, so lost in its bad reputation doesn't make this Scorsese's best.

","Sometimes, when I have difficulty falling asleep, I'll think of Bernard Hermann's jazzy score, and the soothing sound of the saxophone will lay my mind to rest. The surreal images of Travis Bickle's dark perspective of the gritty streets of New York remain a visual wonder. The opening scene in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) is an extreme close-up of Travis Bickle's paranoid eyes, eerily glancing back and forth, which inter-cuts to his vibrant, yet hellish perspective. The image of the taxi cab represents a vessel into Bickle's disturbed mind; he glides through the steam rising out of the sewers and through the colorful reflections of the streets. The opening images establish the bold color palette of a master painter; shades of red, blue, green, and yellow softly meld into a visual orgy.<br/><br/>Visually and aurally, Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver remains the most daring piece of artistry ever conceived on 35mm film. Every camera movement, edit, sound design, and slow-motion shot is felt, not just seen, through every frame of cinematic brilliance. You can sense the master at his fingertips. Why is Taxi Driver the greatest film ever made? I can watch it over and over again, and I'll channel on different aspects of the film.<br/><br/>When Scorsese was shooting the film the crew members were baffled as to why he would pan the camera the opposite way of the moving subject. In the scene where De Niro's character parks his cab and walks out of the garage, the camera does a 180 degree pan the opposite way, and then stops back at the actor as he takes another look at the garage. There's a specific reason to this simple, yet daring camera movement. Visually, the director is saying, that even though the camera doesn't follow him within the moving frame, everything is seen through the character's perspective, going to, and coming away from him. In fact, majority of the film is seen through Travis Bickle's eyes.<br/><br/>In another scene, Travis is talking on a pay phone to Cybill Shepard's character, Betsy, the camera tracks across to the empty, adjacent hallway, which is a clever metaphor of expressing Travis's ultimate loneliness. Lastly, another memorable camera feature is when the director places the actor on a moving dolly as he glides toward the bouncer, inside the bordello. The image gives the viewer an urgent feeling, rushing to the bouncer, which foreshadows their bloody encounter at the same location. ""Taxi Driver"" is filled with audacious camera movements, which have influenced an entire generation of maverick directors, including Spike Lee, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, Scorsese uses a variety of overhead shots, which include the concession items at the porn theater, paperwork cluttered on the desk at the taxicab office, and paperwork scattered on Betsy's desk at the campaign headquarters. As the film progresses and Travis's insanity gradually becomes apparent, the director cuts to a series of overhead shots of Travis's newly acquired guns. The items viewed become more deadly, but ironically, the arrangements are more structured. At the same time, Travis's body gets in better shape, and his bizarre routines provides him with the structure he thinks he needs. At this point, his delusions become a violent reality.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's implosive portrayal as Travis Bickle represents a man's total alienation from society. We're never clear as to what he endured in Vietnam, but the audience certainly senses his traumas, by his sketchy behaviors. He can't sleep nights, obsessed with weapons, and isn't too keen on acting normal in a society, which, he thinks, is based on clicks, populism, music, movies, and politics. Why isn't his voice heard? Why is Senator Palentine heard and Travis kept in the dark? Why aren't porn movies the norm for a date night if they're present all over the city? How are the police doing their job if pimps, drug pushers, and prostitutes still roaming the streets of New York? These inquiries are never heard in De Niro's sincere voice-over, but are certainly worked in the subtext of his performance. Many films have tried to emulate this one-of-a-kind character, such as Edward Norton in ""Down in the Valley"" (2005), and Sean Penn in ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon (2004), but none of them are able to provide strong enough direction""n to make this sordid kind of character believable. You can sense the mental anguish and emotional turmoil Paul Schrader went through when he wrote this personal screenplay. The combustible relationship of script and screen makes ""Taxi Driver"" a powerful journey into the heart of a madman."

","Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" has got to be the most interesting character study I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a former Marine living in New York City is a depressed loner with almost no friends except for the handful few he makes during his taxi-driving stint. He is also an insomniac who chooses to drive a taxi during nights mostly, because he can't sleep. During the days and during his time off, he spends his time in seedy movie theaters playing pornographic movies.<br/><br/>While driving his taxi in the night on the streets of New York City, Travis encounters a wide variety of passengers. In the first half hour he describes his experiences with his passengers and we even get to see one interesting episode with a particular passenger played by none other than the great director of this film himself! All these experiences have left Travis disillusioned about the world as he knows it. He narrates to the audience that there is a lot of ""scum"" and ""filth"" in the streets. He drives around some of the seediest areas of Manhattan during hours when all the sex-workers and hoodlums roam the streets. Travis is still not entirely pessimistic, though, as he narrates in the voice-over: ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."" In the midst of all this filth, Travis gets to meet the beautiful 'Betsy' (Cybill Shepherd) who is a campaign volunteer Senator Charles Palantine, but his joy is short-lived.<br/><br/>Things take a different turn during the final hour of the film, which I will surely not spoil here for the viewer.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro delivers one of the greatest performances of his career and makes Travis Bickle one of the most memorable on-screen characters. He is an absolute treat to watch, as he practically becomes Travis Bickle and also makes one wonder if this is the same man who played the young Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II"" not very long ago.<br/><br/>Of the supporting cast, Harvey Keitel is superb as ""Sport"", the pimp. Jodie Foster makes a strong impression in one of her earliest screen roles as the teenage prostitute, Iris, even though she gets very little screen time. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle both do justice to their roles as Betsy and ""the Wizard"" respectively. Martin Scorsese appears for a short time and shows his ample acting skills in a scene which is perhaps one of the best director cameos ever.<br/><br/>Paul Schrader writes a superb script with one of the most interesting characters ever written for the screen. Equally interesting are his bizarre experiences and his eventual extreme reaction to the disturbing reality he has grown sick of seeing around him.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese directs with the kind of finesse that is expected of him. No other film I've seen, visually details the dark underbelly of New York City as effectively as ""Taxi Driver"". The director shows you some of the sleaziest places in the City full of pimps and prostitutes roaming around. Then there are some mean hoods who come out in numbers at night. You are also taken inside a porn theater with very little seating space and shabby looking interiors and projection screen, where Travis spends his spare time.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the saxophone in the main title is so mesmerizing, the music combined with the disturbing images in the film refuse to let go and keep echoing in your head long after the film is over.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is a haunting portrayal of ""God's Lonely Man"". It is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings and grows on you. This film is certainly not for everyone, considering it is really character-driven and not plot-driven. People who are looking for mere entertainment are likely to be disappointed. For others, who are lovers of some serious art cinema, ""Taxi Driver"" is a must-watch and a must-own!"

","Taxi driver is one of that movies that gets you up at night. The main character, Travis Bickle , is a lonely, xenophobic , angry man who strives each day to get out of the bed. He's an average Joe. However , he isn't that average.

Needless to say, that fails immensely.<br/><br/>We are also granted with the classic moment -""Are you talking to me"".<br/><br/>My only downside to this movie is the music , i don't think it really captures the mood of the overall theme , and can be annoying some times. Of if it does get it, it's just so depressing and atrocious you just wish to fast forward.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Taxi Driver bring us some few questions about our role and the integrity of the common individual in the modern world : what can we do to grow as a person. It also lights the question about how thin is the line between a hero and a monster. It isn't a light mood-ed movie so don't expect the most enjoyable time - do expect though a profound , realistic and human review of the actual status of mankind."

The film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the explosive ending.

He's a man. <br/><br/>DeNiro, teaming up with Scorsese, is a powerhouse. This lonely and depressed man has dark thoughts, he is one person in a city of millions. The script paints the picture vividly, so well that Scorsese is easily able to paint that picture onto film. This movie needed to be filmed on film, if it were done today and were done with digital, it would never get the same feeling. <br/><br/>It is indeed an American classic and is still talked about to this day.

","""Loneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man.""<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a perfect example of the novel-like quality that differentiates a Scorsese movie from those done by many other directors. Martin takes a page out of Woody Allen's book and makes the city of New York just as much a character in the film as De Niro or Shepherd. And against that living backdrop, he tells a story of with all the rage and violence of Raging Bull,  coupled with a profound loneliness and a unique (almost wistful) style that I've yet to find replicated in any of his other work.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is my favorite Scorsese movie. It also features my favorite Robert De Niro performance. It's the kind of film that's capable of imparting the feeling of a time and a place to people who weren't even alive back in 70's New York to feel it for themselves. This movie is made to be watched again and again, and don't be surprised if it improves every time. If I could choose any single one of Scorsese's movies to recommend to someone who is unfamiliar with him, I'd go with Taxi Driver. That says it all."

","For me, this was a great movie that displayed how people can get sick of their surroundings and just make them lash out. It showed this at a great pace, but the one thing I can complain about is that I didn't feel an emotional connection to Travis. He never really showed his feelings until the end. He didn't lash out before that. He got a little angry a couple of times but it was understandable and nothing drastic. However, he truly showed his hate and anger toward the citizens and actions around him. He would write in his journal about how this place needs to be washed away. He had great reasons to think so and it showed in the city around him. He didn't seem quite unstable to me until the end again, however. He just seemed like a normal guy who knew that what was going on wasn't right. Still, this movie is a great gripping drama and deserves a watch."
"jigeeshu23","9","0","0","7 July 2010"," A Cathartic Experience
","Taxi driver is one of the most inspiring movie i have ever watched.<br/><br/>The movie is about Travis Bickle, a lonely man in NYC who takes up a job as a taxi driver which would keep him occupied with some work for most of the day. he has no regrets working 12 hours a day and working at night. He seems a ordinary man but deep inside him there is something special that very few people have it in them. And this something only comes from deep understanding of life. There is a famous quote by Franz Kafka which is absolutely relevant to character of Travis Bickle. It says ""First sign of beginning of understanding is the wish to die."" <br/><br/>Travis drives around in NYC at night. He is moved by various anti-social activities (especaily prostitution) that he witnesses. he could not stand the misery of people who are victims of this filthy crime. when a presidential candidate(Palantine) asks Travis ""What you dislike the most about this country."" Travis says ""i want to get ride of all these dirt on the streets. You know what i mean by dirt."" Travis is suffering from insomnia as these thoughts are constantly haunting him. One night Iris, a little girl gets into his cab trying to escape a pimp but before Travis could run her away she is caught and taken back to their filthy craven. He is very upset with all this around him.<br/><br/>That is when he says. ""Listen all ya people. here is a man who can no more take all this scum."" He decides to get ride of these impurities and buys himself several guns. He request Iris to go home, study and live a good life. He decides to save her by sacrificing his own life. He doesn't care about his life. He seems to believe that, it is better to die than to live among all this filth. He is delirious most of the time. He gets a Mohawk hair cut and one night goes to the brothel where Iris works. he shoots everyone there and insists Iris to run away.<br/><br/>here is an unforgettable scene of the movie. He is seated on a sofa, blood all over his body and clothes. Corpses lying all over the place. Iris weeping in a corner. He attempts to kill himself but runs out of bullets. Police has arrived and he at snails pace lifts his bloodied finger to his head and mimics to blow his head off.<br/><br/>He becomes a hero and receives admiration from all including Iris's parents who are happy to have her home.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is good. The acting by De Niro adds verisimilitude to Travis's character. Everything is put in place very subtly and not flamboyantly as in movies of 21st century. However, I am not happy about the music. It could have been little more prominent with some psychedelic touch. So i rate it as 9 out of 10."
"CountZero313","10","0","0","6 June 2010"," the film Scorcese will be remembered for
","Almost four decades since Taxi Driver was first released, and after countless critiques and analyzes, it is still startling to watch this film and be impacted by the beauty and brutality it portrays. From that opening moment when the cab bursts through the cloud of steam rushing up from the depths, the score emphatically invoking a sense of rising dread, we are transported to another world that is both convincingly seventies New York, and its psychological rendering through the scopophilic lens of a deranged mind.<br/><br/>The violence, filth and profanity so searingly presented are well-documented, less remarked is the quiet moments that work in counter-point to Bickle's inexorable decline. Most memorable is his initial seduction of Betsy, the ostensible honesty of his flirtation both seductive and horrific. Shepherd's contribution to this masterpiece has been related historically in terms of how tough the shoot was for her facing the hostility of Scorcese and De Niro, but in this scene she is no lightweight; a woman told she is lonely and wanting, but confident enough not to dismiss the messenger out of hand. It is only her genuine response at this moment that makes the poignant last scene of the film pay off so handsomely.<br/><br/>The careers of De Niro, Foster and Scorcese went stellar after this, deservedly so, all three arguably failing to match this apotheosis in their careers (though Scorcese certainly has the best claim to counter that argument with Goodfellas). Direction, acting, music, editing and effects seldom gel so well in creating an emotionally complex tale. Hailed as a masterpiece, and deservedly so."
"joshi_3592","10","0","0","25 May 2010"," A chilling performance by De Niro. And Scorses dark urban masterpiece.
","As the trailer so often says, it's one of the coldest performances you'll ever see. Robert De Niro makes a very terrifying character that you feel could burst at any time. Director Martin Scorsese makes a truly enigmatic main character here. It is New york through a nighttime taxi driver. He sees the worlds dark side, he sees the crime and the corruption, and he's fed up with it. People are shallow and ignore the worlds dark side, and the politicians only give false hope. When he then meets a twelve year old prostitute, he decides to take matters in his own hands.<br/><br/>Scorses creates the perfect dark tone for the film, and De Niro completes it with his chilling performance. It's a very blunt film, which isn't afraid of showing us the world as it really is. It's extremely authentic and being a film from the 70's I admire Scorses for the tremendous research he must have done for this film. Pluss he himself have a cameo in the film, as one of the many ""scum of the earth"" (as De Niro calls them) that enters our taxi drivers taxi. Also it features one of Jodie Fosters first movie roles.<br/><br/>I think the relevance and realism of this film is well summarised in the horrible fact that a man called John Hinckley, Jr. felt so connected to the main character, that he went and attempted to assassinate president Ronald Reagan in 1981.he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. His attorney concluded his defense by playing the movie for the jury.<br/><br/>But staying on the subject, this film deserves nothing but a 10/10. And I regret waiting for so long to see it. I recommend this at it's highest, but it's not for the squeamish."

","Martin Scorcsese's first popular film was Taxidriver from 1976. Scorsese is a NY based man, so it wasn't a surprise when his movies reflected the classic NY attitude. Robert DeNiro played the part of Travis Bickle, a once marine who served in Vietnam who is now looking to become a NYC taxi driver. Travis is a young man that is searching for a sense of somewhere to go. The life of a taxi driver is not an easy one; You see everything. He was willing to drive anywhere, but the parts of the city he was around the most weren't easy streets. You needed to have courage which Travis did. On route one night, he encounters a prostitute in trouble, but he does nothing. He sees this girl around and always wonders about her and if he can do anything. As Scorsese plays out the plot, you learn that Travis has some psychological issues that caused him to not always be the popular one in a group. He acts on pure reaction or emotion and lacks the interaction skills needed to act as a key part of society. He end up meeting up with the 12 year old prostitute named Iris, and makes a promise that one day he will save her. Travis murders her pimp and anyone in his way, but Iris is saved. Normally, if you were to hear that someone murdered multiple people you wouldn't think of him as a hero. Scrosese twists DeNiros character into a man that you you support for saving Iris. This film shows early on that Scorsese was an insanely talented man that adds a great touch to the Hollywood film world."

","Scorsese delivers one of the greatest Character studies of all time in this Movie about a marine-veteran who suffers from insomnia and is a very depressed and lonely man who finds comfort in dirty porn theaters. Robert Deniro portrays this character and is phenomenal throughout. Deniro plays a man who seems destined to wipe the street of the scum of the city as he continually gets angrier and angrier and violent even to a point where he shoots a man robbing a store in the back of the head without remorse. After this, Deniro becomes more and more sick of what he sees and hears in his cab in everyday life like Robberies, prostitution and drugs and decides he is destined to end it in his own way. Scorsese does this by adding a 12 yr old prostitute in which Deniro takes a liking to. He pays her to get the time to talk to her so he can try and help return her to her parents and ordinary childhood life. Scorsese's pure brilliance and directing are trademark to what this film was. A study of a man who is utterly disgusted with the way the world is and confused in which way he fits in the world. I believe taxi driver is one of the ten greatest movies of all time because of the versimiltude and realism it brings to the table. Taxi Driver tackles the issue of a man trying to find out who he is and what he can do for the world that seems to suffer around him."

Jodie foster, who plays a 12-year-old prostitute, is trying to be saved by Travis. Travis feels that New York City is full of scum. He see's the violence and corruption in the city during his job and wants to help Jodie Foster's character (Iris) escape her pimp. His own insanity and loneliness causes Travis to lose a connection with people and it is his mission to help Iris. I think that this movie exposed people to the corruption and ""scum"" in New York City at the time. I also felt in some way that it sent an anti-war message to the public. However, this movie also gave people a sense of what war vets go through mentally even after they're home. Sometimes the psychological damage is greater than a physical injury."

","Human beings are generally lonely, from birth to death. Most of us make good friends between these periods. The rest aren't so lucky because they're not wired, seeing everything and everyone but not bale to relate, let alone be respected. They're ""God's lonely people"", and Travis Bickle, depicted by the down-to-earth yet brilliant Robert De Niro (""Mean Streets"", ""GoodFellas"") is one of them, being the lead player of ""Taxi Driver"", a gut-punching, head-slamming, urban noir masterpiece directed by Mr. De Niro's longtime compeer, Martin Scorsese. If you can call it the unofficial sequel to J.D. Salinger teenage-angst tale ""Catcher in the Rye"", you're more than right.<br/><br/>A Vietnam vet who's obviously haunted (probably even before his tour of duty), Bickle suffers from insomnia. He becomes a cabbie to handle it, but it's no use. His workplace is New York City, 1970s style, and the streets are infested with pimps, hookers, pushers, junkies and other social reprobates. Therapy and religion are afterthoughts because the man's too smart and deep. Bickle tries to connect with fetching campaign worker Betsy (a pre-""Moonlighting Cybil Shepherd), but it goes south when he takes her to an intellectually pretentious porn film (I may have to see ""Swedish Marriage Manual"" myself). In his nadir, he gets the notion to ""be somebody"" by killing her boss, a presidentially ambitious senator (Leonard Harris), but is thankfully sidetracked by under-aged harlot Iris (a cherub-faced, Oscar nominated Jodie Foster), who's carelessly exploited by her sleazy pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Red Dragon""). When Travis saves Iris, he's just not only ""God's lonely man"", but a force of nature commissioned by God.<br/><br/>A lot has been said of ""Driver"", and it's all good. Scorsese sharply takes the literate script by Paul Schrader (they later worked on ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"") and puts it on the floor as he films this character study of a man driven to the edge, but not willing to fall without doing something of importance. On the surface, Bickle's a mentally unhinged loser, but, via honest diary-based voice-overs, he's really a man who has the rotten luck to be in the wrong era, surrounded by cynics, phonies, leeches and predators. Oscar-nominated for the role, DeNiro triumphs in Bickle's skin and inadvertently gives a thespian class while doing it. Don't get me started with the Mohawk cut.<br/><br/>The supporting thespians compliment him. Shepard and Foster represent polar opposites of womanhood, in age, appearance and sensibilities, which equally alienate Bickle. Keitel's scumbag role can be the exact mirror image of Shepherd's nebbish co-worker (Albert Brooks). The Wizard, a vet cabbie (the late Peter Boyle of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and Schrader's ""Hardcore""), is quirky with his profane tales and wisdom with fellow cabbies, but he can't ""get"" to the film's anti-hero. If you can spot the two appearances by Mr. Scorsese himself in the film, you deserve three lollipops.<br/><br/>The score by Bernard Herrmann (his last gig here, and the film's dedicated to him) is alternatively sweet and gritty, a great soundtrack that belongs in Travis's throbbing head. D.P. Michael Chapman, under Mr. Scorsese's guidance, echoes European films behind the camera.<br/><br/>A magnificent barrel of celluloid, ""Taxi Driver"" is one of those films that has been a longtime influence. ""The Wackness"" (its' director Jonathon Levine was Mr. Schrader's assistant) and ""Watchmen"" (both film and graphic novel) are more than obvious examples. Though the film's main stage, Times Square, has been ""Disney-fied"" over the years, the 1976 film still resonates today because they are many Travis Bickles in our society, and you can't get rid of them with a business-restriction law."

","Martin Scorsese's brilliant 1976 film about Travis Bickle has the best music score I've ever heard. Bernard Herrmann died the day he finished his recording sessions for the movie. Herrmann did the music for the radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" and the films ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Psycho,"" among many others. <br/><br/>The score for ""Taxi Driver"" has no memorable songs, no hit singles. It's tied inseparably to the visuals, searing and complete. The opening of the movie is riveting, with steam coming from the manholes and a cab appearing through the mists like some monster from a deep lagoon as Herrmann's menacing, sinister score fades in and out. When you've never seen the movie, you don't know what it's about, but you know immediately it's going to be bad. And it is.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie since it came out, it's time to see it again. It's been over thirty years, and Scorsese still has it nailed. It's riveted down and bolted. He welded it. It's still a scorching movie. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet with the scars to prove it. Inside and out. Bickle is seriously mentally ill. He's Holden Caulfield back from the Nam.* He keeps telling people he's got to do something, but he doesn't know what. We know he's going to explode, and we wait with a sick feeling in our stomachs for the carnage.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster was 12 when she played Iris, the child prostitute. It's amazing to see her and realize how good she was. Her scene with Harvey Keitel when he talks her out of running away is mesmerizing. (Some scenes were shot with her 19 year old sister as a body double, by the way.) And her lunch with Bickle is totally natural. She was a star right from the beginning, holding her own with Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel. Incredible.<br/><br/>Keitel is Iris's pimp, the epitome of all that makes Bickle sick, the scummy garbage of New York. Named Matthew, Iris calls him Sport, and she loves him. He manipulates her relentlessly and shamelessly because he makes a lot of money having a 12-year-old whore in his stable. ""You can do anything with her,"" Sport tells Travis, then he spouts a laundry list of filth, sickening Bickle. Keitel is one of my favorite actors; I've never seen him fail in a movie, and he doesn't disappoint here. Sport puts a name and address on Bickle's urge to do something.<br/><br/>I've seen Cybill Shepherd in two movies where she played similar characters: Betsy here in ""Taxi Driver"" (with Albert Brooks as her opposite number) and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" as Kelly Corcoran (with Charles Grodin playing her suitor). In both movies her character is pretty much empty - a blonde who's gotten by on her looks and who has no personality. Betsy provides a whitebread, sane counterpoint to Bickle. The problem is whether we're better off being the sane counterpoint, involved in an election campaign where nothing the candidate says means anything, surrounded by whitebread, incompetent, safe, well-meaning people who truly care whether the candidate's bumper stickers are printed correctly.<br/><br/>Betsy sharpens our focus is on Bickle as he slowly spirals down, letting slip his facade of control, losing his grip on himself, in his solitary hell. Herrmann's score gives music to Bickle's seething anger and danger, underplaying the tempest we feel must be raging unseen in the black night of Bickle's soul. We never see Bickle's torment on his face, but we know his flat affect is the mask of his will to do something, anything to let loose his locked-down demons.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" has lost nothing over the years. The characters, the directing, the music all work. See it with a good sound system.<br/><br/>The movie was produced by a threesome that included Julia Phillips, author of ""You'll Never Have Lunch in This Town Again."" If you haven't read that book, I recommend it. It's free at your local library and well worth the price of checking it out. She also produced ""The Sting,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" and a few others. She had a lot to say in her memoir, and she said it well. Julia Phillips died of cancer a few years ago, I'm sorry to say.<br/><br/>*To carry that analogy further, Iris is both Holden's prostitute and Holden's sister, Phoebe. Bickle protects her."

","This is a great film from Scorsese and De Niro, about a taxi driver's obsession for a teenage girl and his descent into insanity in New York City, the film portrays Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) as a former marine and he has many problems such as being a loner, possibly suffering from some sort of post traumatic mental problem and suffers from chronic insomnia, and to cure that chronic insomnia he takes a job as a taxi driver at night and spends his days in seedy theatres, anyway when he meets Iris (Jodie Foster) he decides he wants to help her and clean up the streets, which leads up to the famous ""you talking to me?"" scene and the shootout in the house. The ending i believe is one of the best in films, as Travis Bickle is lying on the couch after being shot you have to wonder whether Travis was dreaming, still alive or hallucinating? I think the film has career defining performances for Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster who were both nominated for the Oscars, the best performance though comes from Robert De Niro as the disturbed taxi driver in one of the greatest film of the 1970's. The other great thing about this movie is the atmosphere, especially during the night scenes and the cab scenes, which should have been nominated for an Oscar for cinematography, but sadly wasn't despite how great it was.<br/><br/>A classic"

","I can understand why the American Film Institute described this film as a 70's landmark in cinema, this film is simply brilliant. Scorcese does a flawless job in characterizing Travis Bickle, a former marine turned cabbie that develops a violent yet admirable attitude to life in New York City. De Niro...sensational. I have seen quite a few De Niro/Scorses collaborations (Raging Bull,Goodfellas,Casino) and this absorbing performance ranks right up there with the best i have ever seen, with the exception of Raging Bull. Ignoring the acting limitations of Cybill Shepherd, this film is a great watch and at just under 2 hours, it is a suitable length. The other supporting roles are well portrayed, including Jodie Foster as a 12-year old prostitute who is the source of motivation behind Bickles transformation into the city's ""hero."" Overall, I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to any fan of Robert De Niro or any fan of powerful, engrossing and thought-provoking films."

","A lonely, disillusioned taxi driver is disgusted by the filth he sees around him in NYC and decides to take matters into his own hands. As with his other films, Scorsese does a fine job of capturing the seedy side of NYC, helped tremendously by a moody score by Herrmann, who died before release. Although the film is told entirely from the point of view of the driver (well played by De Niro), we are given few clues as to what makes him tick or what pushes him over the edge. It shows the actions of a disturbed man but does not explore his psyche. Scorsese's overly busy camera work is a distraction at times. Ultimately, the film falls short because it glorifies violence and pushes a fascist agenda."

","Taxi Driver is a film as fascinating as it is disturbing. It's one of those films that is not only filmed and acted very well, but also has a rock-solid script that really digs up questions for the viewer to ask - not all of which are flat-out answered.<br/><br/>The movie is a critique of modern society, as well as a razor-edged study of what happens to a person who spends all of their waking time pondering about and dealing with the dark side of humanity.<br/><br/>The protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle, is a very complex and interesting character.<br/><br/>Travis is an emotionally disturbed war veteran, but ultimately, his hinted-at war experiences are merely a catalyst for the mutation of his personality.<br/><br/>Despite his character flaw, Travis is a man who thinks a lot, probably too much. A man who, in a way, is more moral than any other character in the film. Ironically, this is what comes close to destroying him - the fact that his feelings don't merely dissipate to apathy, but are converted to anger.<br/><br/>He tries to remain polite, tries to interact with people despite his feelings of loneliness. He views everything like an outsider. In return, he is rejected, and spends much of his time in isolation with the sordid scumbags of the city.<br/><br/>The cab he drives around in becomes a perfect metaphor for his state of mind - isolated, alone, and often invaded by things he doesn't even want in it.<br/><br/>Hanging around extremes, many of them appallingly amoral, his own viewpoints and emotions become distored and more extreme in response. He becomes desensitised to the extent where he can only feel violent, burning anger and enveloping sadness. He begins to lose a grip on what makes him human...or even what ""human"" is.<br/><br/>He's not forced to hang around the scum. Travis is as much grotesquely fascinated by the excess he encounters as he is revolted by it.<br/><br/>He frequently spends his off-duty time in seedy theatres, but we never get the sense he's enjoying the show. He just sits there, almost bored, perhaps feeling that this is what ""normal"" people do, after his ceaseless viewing of very abnormal people.<br/><br/>One of the sharpest ironies of the film is that Travis' extreme anger actually ends up by bringing him his salvation within society, rather than crippling his life. Whether this is in itself a good reflection on the attitudes of society is again another question.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a great film that will set you thinking, take a look at Taxi Driver. Everything about the film is executed with excellent performances and a merciless precision."

","Just watched it. Very good. Speaking of Travis being a loner, he didn't speak much during the entire movie. But when he talked, he was quite alright. The thing uneasy about him was that he carried a toady smile in his face when talking to strangers, e.g. to the body guard/FBI of the Senator. That was probably from long time isolation. He was a veteran, but of course the movie says nothing directly about the war he experienced, whether it caused his mental unstableness etc. In fact, he was only 26 when retired from the war. Still too young to be a bitter person right away. Well, he was kind of bitter, when talking to the girl he was wooing at about her male coworker, and to the child prostitute about the gangster. He talked mean about man when was with a girl he liked. He talked mean about them when he didn't know them. Of course, I am not saying the gangster was any good. On the contrary, the producer of the movie was not making any judgment during the entire show. He didn't judge whatever Travis was doing right or wrong, nor what the Senator was doing, nor the prostitute, nor her parents. I don't know which side the Senator was on. In fact, that politician was only a small chess piece in this guy's emotional world. He would wish him success or planning to assassinate him only because of his tension with the girl he was wooing at. In fact, the movie says he was not listening to the politician, and did not mention whether the politician was listening to him or not. (a different way to say no to politician in the 70s than ""Forrest Gump"" would, milder, but same ironic.)<br/><br/>The only 'cool' moments of Travis was when he was purchasing guns. (Nobody cares about you when you are not purchasing, huh?) Other time he seemed to be going downwards. He wasn't even very handsome when he used the guns. (Sure. Like in Kurosawa's movies, Samurai were always awkward and nervous when using a sword.) When Travis got angry at society and wanted to do some --, he chose two things: going up to assassinate the Senator, and going down to help a child prostitute. Quite unsurprised, he wasn't successful when trying the 'up' way, but he did get a hell of mess going the 'down' way. And sarcastically enough, he became a city hero in the newspaper. Well, I thought he would just end up dead in the battle, or didn't die but saw the prostitute showing up again. But that didn't happen, or in the later case was not told. He got a visit from the girl who rejected seeing him long ago. She stared at him in an amazed and perplexed look. Arranging that girl to show up again actually make Travis kind of comforted, but he was afraid to appear pathetic. He didn't talk much and ran off, quite typical. In the end there was just the green and red flashing lights of New York. Quite often when people get a cut in emotional life, from love, war or social harshness, they couldn't cure it themselves, and nobody else could attend to them either. There were always something that happened in our lives and we didn't know how to deal with it, called the 'unattended', which I thought was the theme of this movie. When Travis wasn't emotionally living in a healthy way, he didn't actually know that. He was just trying to run away from it. I wish in many years later he wouldn't look back and think of the girl, or the prostitute, just like he shouldn't look at the dirty night of New York city."

","This was a pretty enjoyable film. I understood and related with a lot of the themes that were present within Robert De Niro's character Travis. Isolation, loneliness, desperation, and the mundane repetitive nature of a twenty-something life with no direction. I can see how Travis would literally manifest his sense of self-righteousness and purpose into twisted violence.<br/><br/>I loved the music. I believe that the repetition of the theme song and the subtle changes of the orchestration due to the mood of the film were excellent! This movie tied the soundtrack to the streets of New York forever. I will always hear the music when I see NYC.<br/><br/>The editing and cinematography were top notch, especially in the last scenes. I found it very interesting that Travis entered a new relationship story arc near the last 3/4 of the movie with the prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster). I wished that they would have had breakfast in the middle of the movie. I didn't like the slower pacing during the last 1/4 before the shootout. It felt anti-climatic to me.<br/><br/>The screenplay and acting were great. There were so many memorable lines and parables for life on the streets that we could publish the screenplay as a book for how to live on the streets.

","One of the best and finest films ever made was 1976's ""Taxi Driver"" a classic tale that mirrored the 1970's with it's dark and loner anti-establishment views. And director Martin Scorsese moves the film along just fine as he blends the drama in so well with the dark culture showing how society can provoke one's thoughts and lead them to branch out to violence to feel welcomed in their own subculture.<br/><br/>In one of his earliest roles the great Robert De Niro is Travis Bickle a young man who's out of the marines and at the age of 26 makes his living driving a taxi in the dark streets of New York City at night. And Travis sees it all at night on the dark corners from junkies, pimps, and street walking whores to the police lights flashing when violence occurs.<br/><br/>Travis sees and becomes obsessed with the view of a pretty lady a young and elegant political campaign worker named Betsy(Cybill Shepherd)after asking her out and after dating Betsy sees that Travis has a dark and perverted mind by taking her to an adult movie. Even after the break off Travis becomes sort of a stalker type yet quinces his desire by still going to the adult films and peep shows of New York City. Yet he runs into an interesting catch when he spots a young street walker named Iris(one of Jodie Foster's early roles)who's trying to get away from her violent pimp. Gradually this affects the mood and mind of Travis as he starts to become a product of his own culture and environment by becoming a weapons collector for street safety! Other notable takes are Harvey Keitel as the slick street talking pimp of Iris's and it was nice seeing the now late Peter Boyle as Wizard a veteran cab driver of the streets who gives Travis a few pointers on the yellow night rides. ""Taxi Driver"" is a classic film that shows anyone can get caught up in raw culture and we become products of our environment as our thoughts provoke us to become risk takers. Even though as this film ends violent it was rewarding to show that Travis had did a good deed and became a hero of some sort in this tainted subculture of the streets. Overall great film to remember and cherish for it's thought provoking and social impacts."

","One of Robert De Niro's greatest of all time. And I had many reservations about this film prior to viewing. I was definitely surprised of the real complexity of the movie. Travis Bickle is a depressed loner/taxicab driver who spends many of his nights healing his mind with sexual pleasures. He becomes fascinated with the beautiful Betsy played by Cybill Shephard only to get rejected because of his own mistakes. He becomes enraged and violent which coincidently leads him to save the life of a convenience store owner. It was after this when he met the young and misunderstood Iris (Jodie Foster). He spent his time trying to figure out why such a young innocent soul could turn to such darkness. This becomes his objective, to save the life of a teenage prostitute who has no one in the cold streets of New York. Robert De Niro coined one of his most famous phrases in this film, ""You Talking to Me?"" Great Film! I would recommend it to anyone."

","Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who takes a job drive a taxi around city. During Travis's time behind the wheel he becomes obsessed with the low life scum that haunts his city (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). As the movie progress's Travis starts to lose touch with the real world and becomes determined to rid his city of crime and corrupt politicians. Travis finds his out let in the form of a twelve year ago prostitute, Iris (Jodi Foster), whom he tries to save (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). This is a dark film that looks at the under below of society, a film that is terrifying in one sense. Yet this film could also be a statement to those of us that are in high power, city or state government. It shows that just one person with little care for himself/herself can, and very well may take the law into his/her own hands. Taxi Driver is a wonderful look into the minds of people who just have had enough, enough of the lies, enough of people not trusting people. This film also looks into the minds of those people that are part of the crime; they are part of the reason why Travis wants to clean up the city. During one scene in the film Iris jumped into Travis cab and told him to drive, just get her out of there (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). You can tell by the lighting of that scene that Martin Scorsese wanted to keep Iris face and even her age a mystery, of the views and from Travis. But by the time Travis could leave Iris's pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel), grabbed her out of the cab and forced her to leave. Then later on Travis finds Iris, and tries to convince her to leave, leave her Sport, leave the city, just go back home. But Iris is so lost in the world of drugs, pain, and mind tricks, she believes that Sport loves her and will take care of her (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). Travis Brickle tried turning to Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), a politician who was running for the primary, so he may have his chance winning the Presidency. But just like many politician's then and now he danced around the question, stating that it is harder then Travis may think to change the city, even the county (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). Between Charles Palantine and Iris, Travis had lost control of himself, lost himself to the other side of the law. Travis tried to murder Charles Palantine, and when that failed he turned his mind towards Iris (Phillips & Scorsese, 1976). As long as there is crime, filth, and corruption in life Taxi Driver will be a classic. Taxi Driver is a film that, hopefully will never driver somebody to become Travis, the crazed hero of his city."
"griffolyon12","8","0","0","27 October 2009"," Genuine Madness!
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is an intriguing film. The story of a New York taxi cab driver whose dislike for society drives him to madness. In a way it is the story of a psychopath, but then it turns out to be the story of a vigilante. It's safe to say Travis Bickle is one of the more complicated characters in cinema history.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle, the taxi driver himself, played chillingly by Robert DeNiro, is like a ticking time bomb. You're just waiting the entire film for him to snap, and when he does it is very disturbing, almost too disturbing for me. The true brilliance of the film lies within DeNiro. While I find it disturbing, you can't help but be entranced by his remarkable performance.<br/><br/>The film was directed by legendary director Martin Scorsese. Here, like in so many of his other works, Scorsese glorifies the violence within the film, and if I had a complaint that would be it. The violence is grotesque at times, while some of it adds to the story, I find it more artistic when the violence is merely suggested within a film rather than brutally presented. Even still, Scorsese presents the film with magnificent visuals and terrific performances from his actors.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is really a unique film, it broke the mold as to what one expects out of cinema. It's still to this day a daring piece of work, one that you can't help but admire. As well, it is probably the best character study of a person driven into madness ever put to film.<br/><br/>I give Taxi Driver an 8 out of 10!"

","""Loneliness has followed me my whole life. Everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man.""<br/><br/>From the opening shots with Bernard Herrmann's elegant but menacing score, to the haunting climax, Taxi Driver is one of the biggest classics of cinema (and deservedly so). It is the kind of film where everything comes together into something special; the performances, the direction and the score.<br/><br/>One of Taxi Driver's strengths is how many themes it conveys. It is an anti-war film, a film about a man not fitting into society and consequently descending into madness, and foremost a fantastic depiction of New York City. It is a decadent place, full of prostitution, crime and misery. However, deep inside the film there is also a certain love for the city. The audience relates to the main character Travis Bickle (an outstanding Robert DeNiro) in much the same way; he is a miserable person but we can't help but like him.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't spectacular per se; it is rather low-key, but full of visual metaphors, like when the camera moves from Travis Bickle to the corridor beside him during an awkward telephone conversation with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), as if it is too painful to watch, or when we see a close-up of a pill being dropped into water, representing the violence emerging from under the surface.<br/><br/>DeNiro deserves all the praise he has received for his performance, but the one who impresses me the most is thirteen year old Jodie Foster, who, as far as I know, has never been better since. She portrays a young prostitute with such conviction and balance between experience from life on the streets, vulnerability and childishness that you for a moment forget that you are watching an actress.<br/><br/>Finally, so much has been said about Taxi Driver that I have very little to add, but it is a strong, poignant and at times disturbing film that everyone should see and no one will forget."

","Taxi driver it's an unsettling portrait of society from the point of view of a solitary man who's mind-world is about to take the form of a true nightmare.<br/><br/>The film opens with the street, with a kinda dreamy slow motion shot where a taxi appears from nowhere and then we get Travis Brickle's eyes, giving us the three elements-clues that will echo within the entire film creating multiple meanings and not to forget Travis own leitmotiv (B. Herrman's music)which builds the perfect tension reflecting his very own twisted psychology.<br/><br/>After watching the film, we realize that Travis isn't a man whose words we can take for granted. Was he really on Vietnam? That's a key question we have to ask ourselves, because it changes everything but what's even more important is that he actually believes he was. And he certainly has his insomnia issue which works as a perfect excuse for having him wandering around in the night taking us to places where most drivers wouldn't even bother to go. This describes him as someone who willingly wants to be drawn into, what he refers as to, hell. Now, another question pops-up into our heads, was he aware of this? Did he un-consciously get this job to be near that world? Kind of encouraging himself to take a drastic action (there lies the true importance of Foster's character).<br/><br/>I've always have myself thinking in Travis as a contemporary cowboy (not only because he's called like that a couple of times, also cop or killer, but he's got...believes he has a moral standard as a Sheriff would)and can't help recalling Gary Cooper in High Noon. Although Travis would be an obscure, drogued, neurotic, psychotic reflection of that image (the mirror scene and his own self destruction are a perfect example of his mind).<br/><br/>He feels not only lonely, but misunderstood as well, he doesn't fit on either worlds (being always on the edge). Couldn't make his relationship with Betsy work (Cybill Shepherd), losing his last chance for hope, and falling into his inevitable self-transformation (revealing his true self) of pure destruction. This probably motivated by his constant feeling of helplessness, his racism and delusions of grandeur. But what enlarges the depth of this character is his capacity for being both a hero-assassin(critic to war), he chose to kill the politic candidate and failing his attempt (in broad daylight) he resort onto a killing spree starting with (jodie foster) Iris' pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel)in plain night. This two-sides hero-assassin, plays two different parts, first, it deals with the narrative psychological part of the Storytelling showing us how his plans are frustrated and afterwards in this night-marish-realm how he achieves (his redemption)saving Iris (his princess) from the pimps (dragons) and exorcising his very own personal demons.<br/><br/>After this surreal, violent, and cathartic episode, the followed resolution it's presented in such an ambiguous way that it leaves us questioning everything we just witnessed...Is he dead? Did he actually survive? Is everything back to ""normal"" or just starting once again? Is he even out there? One of the greatest films of all times, and Scorsese's best with Raging Bull and Goodfellas."

And even with my high expectations, this film did not disappoint.<br/><br/>But how can a film directed by one of the all-time great directors in Martin Scorsese, and starring arguably the greatest actor ever in Robert de Niro possibly be a letdown? The answer to that question is- it virtually can't. Now, I'm the type of person that generally hates dramas and finds them quite boring. Prior to watching this, the only one of the few dramas I had watched and enjoyed recently was Gran Torino.

In Trvis mind, it's OK to take your love interest on a first date to a porno cinema, he also believes it's adequate to be some kind of savior for prostitutes, and he also thinks it's normal to plan an attack against an important politician.<br/><br/>Travis got the looks but he was extremely insecure about his behavior and about his mental state. Society didn't give him an opportunity because nobody spent the necessary time with him. Maybe he was just a lonely men who deserved company.<br/><br/>Anyways, this is an excellent film that displays the dark side of human behavior. Martin Scorsese creates a dark yet insecure and disturbing environment where Travis wanders and tries to fix it his own way. That's where Scorsese deserves special recognition; for displaying a terrifying underworld where his main character fits perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. DeNiro steals the show and not only because of his badass display (some infamous scene are thrown like the glorious ""you talking' to me?""). He gives a solid dramatic class act that goes from insanity, to jealousy, extreme violence, through and awkward behavior. Cybil Shepard was really attractive and her performance is fine, she does what she has to do. Jodie Foster demonstrated to have guts through her brave acting and fine looks. She's a great actress.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is haunting yet disturbing but it fits perfect in the right moments like the ending, and whenever Travis is driving.<br/><br/>People, this is not a movie for everyone. You should watch it only if you feel in the mood. There's plenty of violence (verbal and physical), disturbing situations such as mental illness.<br/><br/>The ending is absolutely haunting, dark.

","Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" is an intense urban classic that has disturbed and provoked audiences since it's release. The film centers around the character of Travis Bickle (masterfully played by Robert De Niro), a previous Vietnam veteran, who is living in downtown New York City in a rough-and-tumble area, living like a loner. His job is a taxi driver - so naturally, he gets to meet a lot of people, including a young woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepard), and a teenage hooker, Iris (Jodie Foster). But Travis is one disturbed individual. And as he sees the ""scum"" of the city through his eyes, he ultimately takes it upon himself to violently lash out at the sleazy underside of the city, and plans on executing the city Senator.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" - simply put - is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is a semi-autobiography on Paul Schrader (the writer of the film), who was reflecting on his experiences when he apparently had a mental breakdown himself. Throw in a master director like Martin Scorsese, some top-of-the-line actors (Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster), combined with the intriguing plot, and you've got a really great movie. De Niro is the most remarkable thing about the film - he plays Travis precisely - his mannerisms, expressions, monologues - everything just worked perfectly. The character he played was disturbing, and his performance brought the character to life perfectly. The film is full of vivid performances, I can't say anything bad about any of the players. The last 45 minutes of the film were among the most disturbing of it all, but the film was one giant buildup to the film's conclusion, and was both suspenseful but enthralling. The score, done by Bernard Herrman, who was also behind Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", gives a very haunting and memorable score to go along with the film. Again, (I can't stress this enough) DeNiro's portrayal of the mysterious and menacing Max Cady is the film's real strong point though, and that alone makes it worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Taxi Driver"" is a haunting classic, and is a film that you will likely remember for a long time to come. If the story and direction isn't enough to make you want to see the film, the actors and masterful performances should be a good enough reason. Wonderful, disturbing, excellence. 10/10."

Throughout the entire movie the audience is hanging on to every one of DeNiro's actions. <br/><br/>Scorsese provides great direction for this movie with interesting cuts, slow motion, and scenes of the sleaze and smut of the inner city. Note especially how the final gun fight is shot and the scene where DeNiro's character is talking on the phone and the camera pans over to the empty, lonely hallway. Paul Schrader's excellent screenplay is also added to the mix providing some of the most interesting and enthralling dialogue of any movie. Just simple scenes are brightened by the conversations that Schrader has written. This is all capped off by Robert DeNiro's frighteningly real portrayal of a man who is lashes out at the ""scum"" on the streets. <br/><br/>Overall, a great movie and one of my personal favorites. The themes in this movie speaks to everyone to some extent and is definitely worth at least renting. You may not be a fan of Robert DeNiro or Martin Scorsese but you should still give this movie a try."

","Now three decades old, 'Taxi Driver' enjoys widespread acclaim that has grown with each passing year. It had its release during what is arguably the greatest year in American film history, 1976, which also saw the premiere of 'Network,' 'Rocky,' and 'All The President's Men,' amongst others. Despite its occasional rawness and open-ended conclusion, 'Taxi Driver' will undoubtedly hold its place as a social document and an example of the art that can be generated when great names are brought together in their creative prime.<br/><br/>Most film enthusiasts have knowledge of Taxi Driver's plot. Robert De Niro stars in an Academy Award-nominated performance as Travis Bickle, a 26-year-old man who has been discharged from military service in Vietnam and is now living in Manhattan. We are introduced to Travis at his interview for a cab-driving job, where he is looking to spend insomnia-ridden hours behind the wheel. The opening sequence gives us a tour of his routine, with Travis offering voice-over passages from his diary. From the film's early stages, it is clear that Travis is a victim of circumstance and unfit to exist in 'normal' society. While desperate for interaction with others, his social abilities are so badly stilted that he has trouble holding a conversation. He seems to have no interests or hobbies outside of attending porn houses, watching a fuzzy television, drinking brandy, and writing in his notebook. To make matters worse, he is ensconced in the driver's seat of his cab through all hours of the night, rolling through some of the most depraved streets in New York City.<br/><br/>Trying to find some ground in his life, Travis begins dating Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a young woman assisting the presidential campaign of Senator Palantine (Leonard Harris). Travis fails miserably when he takes Betsy to a sex film in Times Square, perhaps assuming that she will reject him in the long run anyway. Things build from there, as Travis becomes more and more alienated from his surroundings until a genuine homicidal maniac who feels ordained to wipe out society's ills. He buys an arsenal of black market handguns from a local runner and spots his first target in none other than Senator Palantine, who is about to make public appearances in Manhattan. Also drawing his wrath is Matthew (Harvey Keitel), a pimp who is holding a 12 ½-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) prisoner in an East Side tenement. 'Taxi Driver' inevitably explodes into a wave of bloodshed that will leave viewers shattered.<br/><br/>What makes 'Taxi Driver' such an effective film is the honesty of Paul Schrader's screen writing. Travis is an average, blue-collar man who acts pleasantly and has good looks, all of which masks his psychotic behavior. Robert De Niro conveys his thoughts and impulses to perfection, allowing us to clearly follow Bickle's downward spiral into madness. While shocking, 'Taxi Driver' is extremely believable in tracking a man's futile attempts to reenter the social loop. In Iris, Jodie Foster brilliantly portrays a girl who looks streetwise but is inwardly suffering. Harvey Keitel pulls no punches as a foul-mouthed slug whose death could actually be welcomed. Interesting conversation also takes place between Travis and Wizard (Peter Boyle), an easy-going cabbie who uses what knowledge he has to advise others. Leonard Harris is effective as Senator Palantine, the political hack who gets his way through doublespeak. Albert Brooks also co-stars in a limited role.<br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' is a vital commentary on mid-1970s America, when the prior decade's upheavals and chaos resulting from the Vietnam War brought urban life to the verge of collapse. In this sense, Travis Bickle is a personification of the era, when an America overrun with crime, poverty, and corrupt politicians found itself standing on the edge of an abyss. During the film's intense buildup, Travis seems to become one with the ticking meter of his cab, grinding out fares in a world that is counting down and ready to explode. The film also has a lot to say about our media-drenched culture that raises violent behavior to messianic levels, as Travis becomes a hero just hours after attempting to kill a political figure.<br/><br/>The film is not successful on strong performances alone. 'Taxi Driver' was a labor of love for then-obscure director Martin Scorsese, who devoted a great deal of time and effort to his conception. All of his direction is finely-tuned and never does the film suggest pretension or overindulgence. The superb cinematography by Michael Chapman offers a self-contradictory New York City, a place that is frightening yet colorful and vibrant. The last film score by Bernard Herrmann (he died on the final night of soundtrack recording) uses the dark compositional technique that made him a powerhouse for most of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' enthusiasts should not be disappointed with Columbia Tri-Star's recent collector's edition DVD, which includes a 70-minute 'making of' documentary, production photo montage, director's storyboard of the murder scene, interactive version of Paul Schrader's screenplay, advertising materials, theatrical trailer, and four-page booklet. The film itself is presented in widescreen with immaculate visuals and two-channel surround audio that gives fullness to Bernard Herrmann's score. Subtitles are also provided in six languages. With the DVD now available, there are no excuses; 'Taxi Driver' is a staggering film experience that is not to be missed.<br/><br/>*** ½ out of 4"
"robb_772","10","0","0","4 May 2006"," Post-modern masterpiece
","The very embodiment of a post-modern masterpiece, director Martin Scorsese's gritty hymn to big city desperation remains one of the most haunting films ever made. Robert De Niro is outstanding as the titular anti-hero. Driven to insanity by the rejection of the unobtainably beautiful Cybill Shepherd, and intent on saving child prostitute Jodie Foster, De Niro's mentally unstable Travis Bickle is the exact type of morally ambiguous character that becomes an insane murderer to some and a martyred hero to others. It is a difficult and risky maneuver to ask audiences to enter into the world of such an individual, but De Niro and Scorsese never make a single wrong turn in their attempt to provide an understanding, nonjudgmental view of such madness.<br/><br/>The film is intentionally filmed in very grainy, muted colors with relatively poor definition and contrast, which perfectly suits the film's uneasy subject matter. The atmosphere is so vivid, you'll swear you can smell the stench of the back alley garbage piles and the odor of freshly spray-painted graffiti. And De Niro's towering performance is far from the only standout in the cast, with Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel all turning terrific work. This particularly true of Jodie Foster, who, at the right old age of 14, gives a performance of startling maturity and unsettling weariness."

","Years ago I was watching Taxi driver on channel 5 (nyc) and they showed the film in its entirety (sp?). Because of the enigmatic nature of the film fox offered up an analysis that the film was made to show how the media has such power over how events are viewed.<br/><br/>They said that the film was made to show that the media is often wrong but will actually ""change events"". Don't know how much of that describes Taxi Driver although it certainly is an element.<br/><br/>One tidbit that you may or may not know is that Robert Deniro gets heavily into the character he is playing (at least back then). I saw an interview with Albert Brooks who said that he met Deniro for the first time at a party right before they started to film Taxi Driver. He obviously was ""low man"" in acting circles compared to Deniro so he was excited and approached him to tell him that he was thrilled to be working with him. Deniro just stared at him (in travis bickle character style) and completely freaked Brooks out. Brooks spoke very highly of that moment!!"

","I've never saw a movie with no real plot done so well. An army veteran becomes a taxi driver, invites a girl to a porno film, tries to join the secret service, attempts to assassinate a congressman, and saves the life of a 13 year old prostitute all to the tune of probably the greatest original score in movie history. Almost every other scene features the jazzy waltz like tune with DeNiro narrating the thoughts of one Travis Bickle. Plot wise this movie goes absolutely nowhere, which in my opinion is the point. A film that seems to be random thoughts of Paul Shraeder, edited and directed beautifully to the music."
"Imaginist","10","0","0","14 January 2006"," Taxi Driver (5/5 stars)
","Synopsis: ""Taxi Driver"" is a character study, and oh what a character study it is. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Travis Bickle, a NYC taxi driver, who I found to be an OK guy even though he made some stupid decisions. This is probably the crux of the film: we have a guy who tries to do the right thing, but his faults prevent him from always doing so. For example, Travis meets this new foxy lady, played by Cybill Shepard, and takes her out to see a porno for their second date. I don't believe he intentionally meant to offend her, but he does, and it costs him their relationship. It is rather unfortunate considering how happy she made him. Another reason I find Travis to be an alright guy is even after this he tries to make amends with her, but to no avail. I suppose here in lies the problem with Travis: his faults cloud his true character and this causes him to be isolated from others. Although Travis is the result of much of his loneliness I don't believe that he intentionally brings it upon himself--he just isn't very bright. Intelligence may not be Bickle's strong point, but anger and loneliness sure are--Travis becomes not only angry with himself, but angry with the world (as is exampled by his subtle racism), and in fact, he blames the world for all his troubles. Travis is tired of being lonely and ignored--Travis wants to be noticed; he wants to be somebody (wouldn't we all under the circumstances?). Therefore Bickle decides to assassinate a political figure in order to get his old girl friend's (Shepard) attention, as she was working on his campaign. However, when this plot fails to come to fruition Travis makes a last ditch effort to make something of himself--he decides to rescue a child hooker he befriended (played by a wonderful Jodie Foster) from the pimps who enslaved her. This is another reason I found Travis to be good person underneath the rough exterior: although he is tempted to sleep with the girl he doesn't, and instead tries to convince her to leave prostitution. If Travis was truly a monster he would have taken advantage of his young friend, but instead, he displays a higher moral fortitude, which shows that he is capable of being a good guy. Travis successfully frees the young hooker (by killing off the pimps) and surprisingly, he gets the attention he desires. This ending is simply incredible--it is brutally violent, and quite shocking. Although Travis does free the prostitute, we also know that he should not be considered the hero he is made out to be--after all, he freed Jodie's character for his own deranged desires of recognition and attention. ""Taxi Driver"" is an incredibly complicated story that demands great attention. It shows us both sides of Travis Bickle: his good side, and then his deranged crusade for self serving glory. Although I could have become angry with Travis, and hated him, I could not bring myself to do so. I felt sympathetic towards him. When I got right down to it, he was a sick and lonely man, who was incredibly desperate. This film shows us how desperate situations can create desperate people, and sometimes, these people finally snap. The other aspect of ""Taxi Driver"" that dazzled me was how well this film also served as a potent social commentary. The very society that drove Travis to madness, is also the society that treats him as a hero after he murders the pimps; would the public's reaction have been the same if he actually killed the political figure? It is interesting how urban life can twist a man and then twist his actions into something advantageous. Like Travis, it would seem we are more interested in end results rather than our motivations or our means of achieving those results. ""Taxi Driver"" is a complex film that is sure to take various viewings to decipher its multiple messages; however, I think once the viewer has completed the journey down insanity lane, he or she will be more than pleased. For the beautiful yet grungy cinematography, terrific acting, amazing story, and for the infamous ""Are you talking' to me?"" scene, I give ""Taxi Driver"": 5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic"
"alexandra-25","Null","0","0","2 January 2006"," A post-modern classic.
","Taxi Driver is a post-modern classic in that the intention of the director is to permit the viewer to think for themselves, giving their own interpretation of what's going on.<br/><br/>In my opinion the film is about the evolving world, and the freedom's it brings, which culminate in vice, etc; which men of a certain generation and time find difficult to comprehend and come to terms with.<br/><br/>This situation culminates in De Nero's character, Travis becoming isolated. It is the isolation of Travis which is a caveat of what the post-modern era will be, as the English philosopher Thomas Hobbs indicated; a society full of atomised individual's colliding with each other.<br/><br/>Here De Nero's depiction of the atomised individual is played to almost perfection. His intensity makes his presence felt.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is truly a post-modern masterpiece of a film, which is ahead of its time."

","The setting is New York City. We start out with Vietnam vet Travis Bickle (beautifully played by Robert De Niro) where he wants to be a taxi driver at night because of his insomnia problems from the war. Then we realize that there is an election going on for presidency. Travis starts to fall in love with a campaign worker named Betsy when he first looked at her from the window. Then one day for the first time he ever spoked to her asks her out for some coffee. She somehow says yes and they start to get to know each other. Travis asks her out to the movies. Betsy and Travis then go to a movie at night. Travis then takes her to a porno film that 'all couples go and see'. Betsy then never wanted to speak to Travis ever again. Travis then starts to become crazy ever since. He starts to think the street has turned violent. So he goes and buys a few guns to settle the score but unfortunately decides the presidential candidate is a bad man and should be assassinated. I have no more to say about the story.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorites. Bernard Hermann's music; Loved it. Just loved it. The ending is one of the most bloodiest scenes on earth. Scorsese has created something brilliant. One problem; Would you decide if Travis was a villain or a hero? I forgot to mention about Jodie Foster. Foster is a twelve-year old who ran away from her family to go to New York and become a hooker. She received her first nomination for her role. That is how good she was. I think she was fifteen when she did this role; I don't know. Some may not pay attention because it is not their kind of film and people nowadays are into the violence. This film is a masterpiece.

It turns into a nightmare.<br/><br/>His isolation is complete. His pride makes it impossible to return to his parents and his less than basic understanding of human interaction makes him an absolute outsider.<br/><br/>At work, colleagues are cordial but distant and there is no family, friends or love for him. Unfortunately, Travis, though uneducated and lacking in understanding the problem, is not stupid. He understands what's happening and starts to see society as the enemy. Society is a hostile environment that wants him out and threats him like a monster.<br/><br/>Travis personalization of one man against the world starts to turn ugly when he sees the 'filth' on the street. His job takes him to the less than savory nightlife on the streets. He really resents this. Why can hookers, drug-addicts, sellers and the 'scum' have a life, be part of it, while he can't ?<br/><br/>When hope turns up into the form of Betsy and is subsequently drown by his misunderstanding/self-destructive nature, the descend into madness quickens. Yet, he needs to fabricate a reason and killing Palantine (for the treason of Betsy) or the rescue of a clearly underage hooker Iris) will do.<br/><br/>After the inevitable violence, the ending is one of the best I've ever encountered. It can be taken two ways. It could be Travis' last moments of hope in which he believes he's made a hero for cleaning up the filth, forgives Betsy and receives thanks for giving Iris a better future. But likewise, it could be that Travis actually survived and this would make the ending a warning and a ironic look at society, itself a disturbed creature.<br/><br/>Schrader, Scorsese and Deniro at the top of their power, supported by a brilliant score from Bernard Hermann. The whole movie is shot from Travis point of view and Deniro carries the picture effortlessly. Betsy and Iris both do what they're expected to do but cameo's of Harris as Palantine and Brooks as Betsy's coworker also deserve a mention. The only ones that seem a bit intrusive are Boyle and Keitel. But there's really nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>Important, better than perfect (which only means there's nothing wrong with it). If you care about people, there's nothing trite or repulsive in here. Nevertheless, shocking and disturbing, certainly if you look at the time it was made, it hasn't lost it's value.<br/><br/>One of the three movies I gave a 10."

","Taxi Driver (1976) was a very controversial film from the team of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader. The movie shows the decay of the inner boroughs of Manhattan and the decline of a disturbed individual's mind. <br/><br/>A former Viet-Nam vet turned cab driver (Robert De Niro) is roaming the streets watching the world go to pot. The line between fantasy and reality is ever blurring because of his mental status. Slowly over time he imagines that society needs someone who will clean the streets and get rid of the vermin that runs rampant. After having a falling out at an attempt to have a normal relationship with a w.a.s.p.y woman (Cybil Shepard), he decides to become a young prostitute's savior (Jodie Foster) and bump off her sleazy pimp (Harvey Keitel). After trying to impress his ex-girlfriend by nearly killing her political employer, the cabbie decides to go out in a blaze of glory whilst confronting the pimp and the prostitute's client in a nearby flop house. Instead of being locked up in a loony bin, he's proclaimed a hero.<br/><br/>A strange film from Scorsese. It was made during the last phase of his innovative career. After this film, he went on to direct more subtle fair. Paul Schrader would become Hollywood's next wunderkind and have a brilliant (but short) career himself. Even today, this movie is still rife with controversy. The inflammatory racial content and views of mental illness still ruffle people's feathers.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","I have read many reviews on people who didn't like this movie, most of them saying they didn't get the movie or that they thought this movie was about a hero taking justice into his own hands. That is not at all what this movie is about. This movie is about the power of the human psyche, and how fragile it can be. The development of the main character, Travis Bickle, throughout this movie follows the transformation of his mind and shows how certain events can shape one's mind and lead a person to things unimaginable. An important film, and a must see.<br/><br/>p.s. I believe this movie, in a way, to be the follow-up of another great De Niro film, ""The Deer Hunter."" Seeing as how De Niro's character is a Vietnam war vet, you could use his character in the Deer Hunter as the background for Travis Bickle, and it would help to explain a lot in this film."

","A modern urban symphony,a man who has fought a true war fighting a truer one,a rhapsody of colours moving back towards the root of an alienation that requires nothing but going on,a pure denunciation of our world. saying that it is just a film which belongs to the violent realism of 70's means not to understand the great message it brings with.probably one of the most unfairly not celebrated film ever made.the top(though I hate pointing out the best scenes of a movie)is when travis -before he meets betsy - walks down the street well dressed through people with the slow-motion camera. even betsy's face in the last scene is full of meanings:while city's lights slide behind her and she looks at travis,he's not caring anymore about her,we can easily understand that right now he is not as lovely as he had been before:any of his precedent friends,situations,relations are just the steps of a way he has just ended,and he can't go back.but then why the movie can do that?why making them meeting again?I believe that this was done just in order to remark travis's distance from what he had been interested by.as she gets off,once again city's objects are mixed up as if sounds and images were no longer able to express by themselves a personal point of view and the madness of a man who even when celebrated can't get satisfied of how the world,and betsy,too,looks at him.the ending is not an happy one:people don't smile to him until he is a poor and lonely man but start loving him like they never did just because he did something,and think of him as if he had changed a lot:he hasn't changed!-or,if he has,they can't know.He had dreamed of being somebody:well,he had already been somebody,and went on being,not only thanks to the massacre.A masterpiece."

","I want to explain again that I've heard what a great director Martin Scorsese is. Now I'm trying to watch all his movies and enjoy them. Some, as ""Taxi Driver"" are not very enjoyable, but are near excellence. To conclude, ""Taxi Driver"" is the best I've seen from Scorsese up to now.<br/><br/>This is the oldest movie I've seen in quite a while. I don't know if I said it before, but there was a time when cinema included passion, and movies were made with passion. I'm talking about before the 80's; Coppola, Bogdanovich, Scorsese""Taxi Driver"" is an example of this, and Scorsese had just started. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro was at his top when his career started; playing main roles in his first movies, creating sensation in the audience and gaining respect from the critics. He's one of the best actors of all time. After Coppola provided for his Oscar in ""The Godfather II"", ""Taxi Driver"" was the next big step. Anyway, he was a pro already, and he was determined to deliver great performances during the rest of his life. He looks younger than his character (Travis is 26, he was in his thirties), and he says the phrase often remembered (""Are you talking to me""?) while he looks at the screen and performs the story of a man who can't sleep and writes about what he does. <br/><br/>The script, by Scorsese's long time collaborator Paul Schrader, is a wonderful tale of real, daily life, in a city where Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) observes the people, and wants to save them in some way: ""You got to clean this up"", he says to Charles Palantine, a candidate for president. He's not lying.<br/><br/>He only knows about Palantine because of a girl who likes; Betsy. This performance by Cybill Shepherd is honestly something to be talked about. She stepped out of being Bogdanovich figurine (even if she did it good in those movies), to play a main character in this film. Her interpretation is unbelievably natural and experienced as the rest of the cast. She doesn't seem someone who has just started. Shepherd did some movies in her career; some of them were good, some bad But she had the talent.<br/><br/>For Jodie Foster (Iris), at her young fourteen years, this was the first recognition that foresaw tons of awards and an excellent career. Her performance didn't show talent in best ways, but was crucial to the film's development. In Travis Bickle's mind, he has to do something for a girl he has met a few times and senses she is not living well. Who else would ask for ""action"" with a prostitute just to talk to her?<br/><br/>Then there are two other important performances; one is Albert Brooks' Tom, in a very funny way as he spied his ""girlfriend"" when Travis, the ladies-man, was talking to her. The other one is Pete Boyle's Wizard, whose wisdom encourages Travis in his impulses. They both have a talk, De Niro and Boyle, sitting on a cab. This is one of the best scenes in the movies. Travis wants to know more about the cab driver's life, or wants to know how is it that he has to do it; because he can't sleep. Then the Wizard delivers a speech of an uncertain exactness; because he knows, and that's why he is called the ""Wizard"". Travis doesn't understand; we probably don't either. <br/><br/>As Travis goes back into his yellow cab and looks at the city with disappointing eyes, we're waiting to listen to the music again. That fine music by Bernard Herrmann that shows peace and serenity. I loved it. <br/><br/>Let's just not forget about the movie director; this is Martin Scorsese. He manages to achieve great shots of the streets at night; completely narrative, following the story. Then an excellent visual labor in small takes like the shooting training and like the gun in the window. He follows his characters closely, focusing on them and what's behind them. He doesn't let them go. <br/><br/>About Travis Bickle's life, and what he does, it's all in his head; taken to life by De Niro. He has good, bad moments. He changes radically and starts to eat good food, drops his pills. Although then he changes again, and he introduces another pill in his mouth. His mind gives an overturnYou'll know why.<br/><br/>Scorsese's final shots are just an explanation and conclusion to everything. He's talking to us, and he's saying: ""This is what can happen. It has happened here""."
"bishopdante","9","0","0","4 May 2005"," Travis is psychotic? I'm not so sure
","Travis is certainly alienated. He has no power in his role as a cabbie. All he can do is interact as a subordinate with all of the characters he meets along the way. He listens to them, and is stunned by their mealy-mouthed excuses for why they don't use the power they have in life. This is particularly well illustrated by Scorsese's own role as the jilted husband, and Travis's reaction is that of well hidden disgust. This guy is going to travel in a cab to watch the window and not do anything? It's pathetic. Actually he's there to talk to the cabbie, to stand on the shoulders of a subordinate to bolster his injured ego. The politician near the end is another example of all talk and no action, ego gratification. Travis sees so much vanity and evil on his travels that he finally decides that he's going to do something about it. He's not psychotic, and he isn't insane. He's just reached the breaking point of passivity. He's been lumbered with the passivity of others, and has had passivity enforced upon him by his job. He commits mutiny in order to choose good. He breaks the law in order to become the law. He reflects upon his position (the mirror scene) and is willing to sacrifice himself for the welfare of others, something no other character in the film is prepared to do. The rescue scene at the end is virtually a fairy tale setting, the rescue of an imprisoned princess from the evil pretender to the throne (the pimp). I believe that Travis is indeed a hero, not a man descending into psychosis. He triumphs over the neurosis handed to him on a daily basis by his superiors (employers) and becomes a man capable of choice. It's all about free will, and the ability to choose good, even though the path to good may involve fighting evil with violence. This film is about the weakness and sickness of a falsehood : ""pacifism is the moral high-ground"". It is not. One must commit to one's beliefs. Another fantastic thing is that at the end he's broken the law, and committed murder, but the system is so passive that they uphold him as a hero in the newspaper. Yet Travis is still just a cabbie, and he doesn't take it seriously. He doesn't need the approval of others. He's realised that he doesn't need anything from anybody, and is no longer alone, he's self-sufficient."

It's based on a wonderful story of a lonely cab driver who is virtually alienated from society, but with psychotic aspirations to be somebody. But his motivations for life were not in full bloom until he met a child prostitute and got determined to rescue her. Robert DeNiro is at his very best as the title character, Travis. His mental transformations throughout the film is brilliantly portrayed by DeNiro. Young Jodie Foster is also excellent as the 14-year-old Iris. In a short screen time she nicely managed to show her talent. The rest of the supporting cast are quite good, too, especially Harvey Keitel.<br/><br/>But only good casting does not make a good film. This film is a classic because it's every part is classic. Take screenplay, and it is one of the smartest ever written, with some legendary quotes like: ""You talking' to me?"" or ""I know, you're a narc."" Take cinematography, and hell, how can you forget the violent scene after the final showdown, or the scene that reveals Travis' Mohican haircut? Take background music or the score, played primarily on Saxophone, it vividly expresses a feeling of utter loneliness throughout the film. And for Scorsese, I just don't know what to say. I have to search for the guy who got the best director Oscar that year. It's a shame."
"OllieZ","9","0","0","31 March 2005"," Terrifying movie from Scorsese.
","Probably Scorsese's most blatantly dark work to date, Taxi Driver is cinema at it's best. Not only is the whole atmosphere brooding and realistic, but the nature of Bickle (De Niro) is highly ambiguous - sometimes splitting opinion to weather he is hero or just plain psychopath.<br/><br/>Tearing away from the stilted conventions of Hollywood films, Scorsese dares in this movie. The cinematography is great, with great shots showing Bickle's world, and the birds eye view of the crime scene at the end of the movie. The editing is fresh, used to great effect to bring out the visceral nature to Scorsese's work that we are so used to. While not as powerful as the work in Raging Bull, or as lively as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver is a calmer beast, taking its time in telling story and revealing the surroundings - which fits in well with the theme of the movie anyway.<br/><br/>Scorsese also created the meticulously planned shooting at the end of the movie, which happens to be one of my favourite scenes ever. While not exactly polished (special effects in the 70's were used rarely), the gritty feeling really shines through, and although the blood is slightly saturated (to get certificate!) it is still highly violent. Set in the claustrophobic pimp house of Sport (Keitel) the scene just fizzes with energy, even if it contains as much dialogue as an early Chaplin movie.<br/><br/>De Niro is frightening as Travis Bickle, the protagonist of the movie. He is so layered; the tics, the sayings, the feelings - De Niro has created someone so real, it is untrue. It's always the little details that stick out - like when De Niro puts his hand in his pocket (to reach for a gun?) during the ""president's"" election show - to spook out the guards. To see them running after him, as Bickle has a childish grin on his face is just priceless. To see this character burn slowly over the course of the film is something to experience. As I said at the start, Bicle is highly ambiguous, which I think is the best kind of character to have in a film, wherein the audience can decide weather or not he is hero or villain.<br/><br/>Foster is great as the 12 and a half year old prostitute - a challenging role for any young actress. Cybill Shepherd, although slightly primitive in terms of acting skills, she suits the role well. The rest of the cast are superb too, with Keitel giving a sleazy performance as Sport, the pimp.<br/><br/>So, where does this rank in Scorsese's already-really-amazing-CV? Certainly. It is up there with my top 4 Scorsese films: Goodfellas, Casino, Mean Streets, After Hours. A classic if ever there was one."

","Paul Shrader's undeniable masterpiece of urban alienation. I grew up in a suburb of Grand Rapids, Michigan which was very protestant in a uniquely conservative fashion, much the way Shrader did. I know how it felt not being able to see a movie until he was 18, and then having these floodgates open to a world a fleshly pleasures that you aren't quite ready for. As Shrader said, ""it takes a certain kind of white boy"". The combination of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score and Scorcese's direction makes the audience feel somehow sympathetic for this man who seems normal to his peers, yet mentally disturbed to only those who see him when he is alone, the audience. No film before or since has brought forth such a sense of impending doom."

","Look for no further proof of what a great actor Robert De Niro is than in Martin Scorcese's ""Taxi Driver"". De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a racist, mentally unstable, violent, lonely, and scarred Vietnam vet. ""All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets,"" he says while driving his taxi through the dark and dangerous streets of 1970s New York City. But the amazing feat of his performance is that behind all of the character's hateful traits, De Niro is able to make him likable. During the film's brutal climax, we somehow cheer for him.<br/><br/>Travis takes the job as a cab driver and takes all kinds of people in his backseat, from hookers to politicians to men more mentally unstable than he is. The city of New York has barely ever looked so menacing. The alleys are all crowded with punks, gang bangers, teenage prostitutes, XXX movie theaters, all of this accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's jazzy melancholic music score. You can nearly understand why Travis hates the world around him, how he isolates himself in his taxi cab, and why he will eventually take action into his own hands.<br/><br/>But then comes Betsy, (Cybill Sheppard) a political campaign worker who Travis falls in love at first sight one day when she enters her office in a white dress. All of the sudden, Travis starts wanting to ""fit in"" and attempts to get close to her by working in the campaign office and going out with her on dates. Betsy obviously doesn't love him, but does see him as an interesting character. This all shatters when Travis takes her to see a ""dirty"" film as it is his idea of a romantic evening (this was the post-""Deep Throat"" era, when hardcore porn films got theatrical releases) and Betsy finally sees that beneath his strange charisma, Travis is a troubled man.<br/><br/>Feeling rejected and realizing she is just like the others, Travis goes on a moral outburst of rage. He decides to free New York from its scum by himself, with his own hands. Hee trains with firearms, works out rigorously, and isolates himself from society even more. One day, he kills a black criminal wanting to stop him from robbing a grocery store and the owner lets him go, while taking his anger into the dead body. That is Travis' first experience as a hero, but it doesn't come even close to his major mission: Rescue a 12-year old prostitute named Iris (then ""newcomer"" Jodie Foster) from her corrupt pimp (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>Screenwriter Paul Schrader originally wrote the pimp character as black, and then changed it not wanting the film to expose Travis' racism to a point where the audience despises him. As with most of Schader's work, ""Taxi Driver"" deals with a dysfunctional hero who wants to stand up against the dark forces surrounding him, but this film is the exception, where De Niro's character becomes the deranged madman he so despises.<br/><br/>The film could be compared to a superhero origin story, since we see the hero from the middle stage of his life as he slowly goes from a common man to someone who wants to make a difference. We never flashback to his true origin though, since we never learn what exactly happened to Travis during Vietnam. I've never seen anyone use this film to compare it with the Columbine High School shootings either, which always amazed me. The two kids who opened fire into their classmates perhaps weren't much different from Travis. They saw high school pretty much the same way Bickle saw New York, wanting to ""clean"" it from popular cheerleaders and jocks.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" indeed is one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the most important films of the 70s, and it deserves every bit of hype as it gets. From Schrader's script to Herrman's music, (his last work as he sadly died the night after the recording) everything works to an outstanding level. However, I usually disagree when people call this Scorcese's finest hour. Although by no means am I stating Scorcese's work was below par, this isn't exactly what one would call a ""Scorcese picture"". In fact, I would say Paul Schrader deserves more credit for this than Martin usually gets, especially when watching Schader's other films, like his sophomore directorial effort ""Hardcore"". I would personally prefer ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"", or even Scorcese's criminally underrated effort ""After Hours"" to this as a ""Martin Scorcese film"".<br/><br/>***spoilers*** And much has been said about the ending. . I am one of the supporters that the final moments of the film are Travis' dying thoughts. Both Schrader and Scorcese have spoken against this theory. After starting a shootout and killing the pimp and other bordello employers , Travis lies deeply wounded on a chair and the camera pans all the way outside where police cars start piling up. We then learn Travis was seen as a ""hero"" by the media, and how he is now a finally happy man. He picks up Betsy again, and this time she seems to be more interested on him. We are supposed to believe that not only Travis wasn't arrested, or killed by a bullet in the neck, but also that Betsy would actually want to get back with him again. I also find the shot of Betty seen by Travis' mirror a bit too ""dream-like"", the way it is lighted and the wind blows her hair like she is a supernatural life form of beauty and sensuality. But interpret it in your own end, it is still a great ending, and it does give the film a sense of closure, since it begins and ends with Travis driving through the dark streets of New York in his yellow taxi."

He decides to act upon his anger when we crosses paths with a teenage prostitute, and decides to rescue her from her bleak lifestyle.<br/><br/>The ever resilient Martin Scorsese did a masterful job directing this film from a dark, and brilliant script by Paul Schrader. The most powerful thing about ""Taxi Driver,"" is that it has the impeccable ability to enter Travis Bickle's psyche while interacting with his inner demons. Robert De Niro is flawless in a performance that arguably established him as one of the all-time most gifted actors. Jodie Foster (Iris) at age 12 gave the mature performance of a 40-year old, in her harsh, real depiction of a teenage prostitute. There are other fine supporting performances from Peter Boyle, Cybill Sheppard, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel as Iris's pimp. Finally there is one other facet of ""Taxi Driver"" that is as essential to the film as its characters. This is the score. Bernard Hermann, wrote a hauntingly unforgettable soundtrack that would be his final masterpiece. Once you hear his music, it will never escape your imagination. If you never saw ""Taxi Driver,"" you don't know what you are missing. This film will take you on the ride of a lifetime."

","Martin Scorsese is the master of the character-study.hes made films on people ranging from the Dalai-lama to a blue collar gangster to Jesus Christ.but never has been to repeat the success he had with Travis Bickle,a man isolated from the world, his own actions leading to violent consequences. the film follows the life of Travis Bickle ,a new-york city cab driver as he shifts his attention from trying to romance a political volunteer to assassinating a presidential candidate to finally ""freeing"" a young prostitute. as you can tell,there is no particular plot ,the movie focusing only on Bickles character.dissatisfied, disillusioned and dark, no sane man can identify with his actions or the reasons that guide him. his character is the only focus of the movie ,which leads to little development of any other characters in the movie.but this is only nit-picking in a movie which as a whole is a master-piece,with an ending that makes a wry comment on society. i cant think of any actor living or dead who could have performed in this role the way Robert Deniro did.to bring such a disturbing character to life ,making him flesh and blood is just unbelievable.his best and most complex role to date.of all the Scorcese-Deniro collaborations, this is the best."

Before he became a screenwriter and director, Paul Schrader was a scholar of Japanese film at UCLA.<br/><br/>He must have had Kurosawa in mind when he wrote the climax to ""Taxi Driver."" Of course, Schrader and Scorsese undermined the heroism of Kurosawa in favor of ironic horror, but the parallel is not accidental. Schrader, Scorsese, Lucas, all the movie brats of that generation owe a great deal to the Japanese cinema, Kurosawa in particular.<br/><br/>Much of ""Red Beard"" is derived from Dostoyevsky (listen to the DVD commentary from Criterion) and ""Taxi Driver"" was a riff on ""Notes from the Underground.""

","The seventies brought us the greatest films of our time from the Godfather one and two, The Deer Hunter, Serpico, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest and so on. Martin Scorceses Taxi Driver definitely ranks up there with the most poignant films in its dark and disturbing nature. De Niro seems to have a special ability to play unstable individuals as he did so flawlessly playing Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. Taxi Driver is no different and De Niro gives one of his most powerful performances in his career, on par with his appearance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part two. This film is at times slow moving but this is to allow you to get into his world and it works. As we watch him driving around in his taxi acting maybe a little bit weary and odd we get the impression that he isn't that weird. Well this is the part where he takes his girlfriend for a night out and to where? To a very romantic porn film. After this I just thought get out while you can woman and thankfully for her sake she did. Travis (De Niro) was now very clearly a mentally unstable man, the film then takes off from here and the story becomes very compelling. De Niro decides that he must clean up the streets as the authorities just don't seem up to it. He takes on the role of a secret government worker and he sets off on his destiny. Watch in amazement as De Niro gives a chilling five minutes of him in front of a certain mirror. The scene ""you talkin to me"" is quite brilliant and it did pioneer many reminiscent scenes after it. With De Niro looking very much psychotic, deranged, chilling and just amazing this scene was truly terrifying. This film catches many major issues that are still very much around today; when De Niro befriends a thirteen year old prostitute played by an excellent Jodie Foster we are shown a side to De Niro that was always there but just did not surface. He wants to help this young girl, help her to escape from the vile pimp (Harvey Kietel). This is where De Niro takes revenge on behalf of Foster and the finale is quite brilliant. Yes it is bloody and yes it is very real, 'A savage piece of work', with Scorcese at his pinnacle and De Niro playing to perfection this bold, dark, surreal and evil film is a must see not only for it's wide recognition but also for it's reminder of the mentally ill people whom live in this world. Hellishly superb, only the Devil could have orchestrated such a fine and twisted film."

","De Niro at his best. Scorsese at his best. Can't go wrong? Well no you can't. This is one of the greatest films ever. De Niro was robbed of the best actor award in the Oscars that year as was the film itself by Rocky, much as I love the Italian Stallions debut outing. This is a dark and murky character study of a sociopath and a loner who can't seem to find a way to vent his disgust at the world around him. It eats away at him until he finds some focus in a 12 year old prostitute, played excellently by Jodie Foster. Scorseses bleak and unreserved portrayal of New Yorks dark side is often graphic in visual and dialogue and often unsettling but the film is engrossing. It's full to the brim with darkness and pessimism about it's setting and it's central character who seems on a downward spiral until the end, when he finds some redemption thanks to Foster. De Niro is electrifying in a truly legendary performance, told mostly through De Niro's physical performance and telling a story through his eyes. Travis says little but we start to learn what makes him tick because of De Niro's brilliant performance. Also this has a brilliant and unique score.*****"

","I have started this `review' about fourteen times, fourteen different ways, because there isn't a lot that can be said about this film that hasn't already been said.  The plot is fairly well known:  Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a taxi cab driver who works long hours because he doesn't sleep, and lives a life of near isolation.  When he does attempt to reach out to others, it becomes near-obsession and eventually ends up almost killing him.  (Or does it?)  <br/><br/>I cannot fully express the impact this film had on me at an early age.  When I first saw it, in my very early teens, I was transfixed with Scorsese's direction, the gritty atmosphere and the unbelievable acting by DeNiro.  It was after I watched `Taxi Driver' that I decided to attend film school because I saw something different in this film, something that was gritty, dramatic and exciting.  Until then, I had pretty much seen films that had fairly happy endings, or at least had endings that were sewn up fairly tightly.  `Taxi Driver' turned that whole mindset completely upside down. <br/><br/>
The great thing about `Taxi Driver' is its compelling nature.  When I recently watched it, it was probably my twentieth (or so) viewing in my entire life.  Even after reading books and articles on the film and even studying this film in film school there are still elements of the storyline that are left up to interpretation, and while I thought one thing years ago, twenty years later, I think something completely different based on my own life experiences and elements (I try to) have learned about human nature since.  Since I first saw this film, I have developed a very deep respect for Martin Scorsese as more than a filmmaker, due to his unbelievable series `A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American film' and the various documentaries/essays he has participated in. To me he has become more than a brilliant film director; he is a film scholar  he lives film, and breathes film and seems to relish sharing his superior knowledge of film, a level I can only dream to achieve.  I was 13 years old while I first sat wide-eyed, watching `Taxi Driver' and two weeks ago I was 31 years old while I sat wide-eyed, watching `Taxi Driver' and the impact, while of a different kind, was just as strong.  <br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Considered a landmark in the art of filmmaking, Taxi Driver explores the depths of human loneliness and the extreme consequences of such. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver in New York who has been lonely most of his life, and displays behavior that perpetuates that fact, which makes it all but impossible for him not to be. This life of isolation and self destructive behavior ultimately leads up to one thing for Travis, brutal and intense violence towards those who he feels are killing the world through their despicable behavior and lack of moral. A simple story, executed nothing short of masterfully, that slaps the viewer across the face and introduces the greatness of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese to the world.<br/><br/>From the musical score (brooding warning), the buildup of the story and characters, the acting, and the direction are simply flawless. TD takes a little while to get started but that is very necessary to develop the characters involved, especially Travis (De Niro), as we need a point of reference in which to gauge his changes in mental state as the film progresses. Younger cinema lovers might get inpatient with this film, but true film aficionados will know what we have here...ass kicking cinema that is rarely made like this anymore. This is the second installment of the Scorcese/De Niro duo that would come to be one of the most formidable and predictably great partnerships in movie history.

","Can't say what hasn't been said...: In my opinion, this is De Niro's best performance. Unfortunately for me, everything that can be said about this movie has already been said, so I will simply say why I enjoy it. Apart from De Niro's performance, the violence is tackled well, without being glorified (remembering Bickle's reason for it), but without seeming over the top. Insomnia has never been more perfectly shown, and the imagery of the sleazy New York night life is gruesomely bleak. Unlike many films which try to bleak, or depressing for ninety minutes, then shove a twisty, happy ending in our faces, Taxi Driver leaves us with an ambiguous conclusion. Bickle is psychotic, which may or may not be his fault, and that does not matter. We do not know what is future will be. (If he survives that is, the final scenes may be a dream sequence)"

","I do not see point commenting the technical sides of one of the best movies ever to have been made. I am just tempted to point out how much Travis Bickle fits the pattern of a Christian saint, a consistency in his character which deserves some thoughts. Travis is a loner as hermits are, yet subjects himself to strict physical discipline, as hermits do, leads a frugal life without any aspiration for luxury, as holy men do, stays sleepless practically 24/7, as hermits do, is obsessed with the idea of sin, stays out of the ways of the world (the episode with the jealous man who was vowing to kill his wife with a .44 magnum), yet in the next moment preaches salvation to young Iris, is both an outsider to the society he supposedly lives in (brings the beautiful Betsy to a movie couples watch to strengthen their libido because he has no idea what ""decent"" people watch), stands below the others (has limited education) like a humble holy fool, and often speaks like a holy fool, yet on other occasions stands above the people around him, up to an unattainable height (his bugging up Sport in the day scene or ridiculing the Secret Servce guy). In short, anything Travis does in the movie EXCEPT his short-lived dating affair with Betsy, fits the image of the saint which ""career"" he himself wants to bring to glorious martyrdom with the spectacular, and suicidal, assassination of the evil candidate for the presidency who stands apart from the problem of the slums.<br/><br/>Yet, this is a saint of evil and there is no doubt about that. Travis is anything but a Christian, he genuinely hates the ""scum"" instead of wants to see it flushed down in the toilet, recurs to violence and retaliation, is abusive and pardonless, and quite suggestively, is obsessed with part of what he supposedly combats: pornography. In my opinion, Scorcese is really picturing the image of the modern saint, as he is possible in the 1970's: a society of irredeemable sin engenders murderous saints."

","Travis Bickle is somebody who knows what he is talking about.  Martin Scorsese created a character who knew what was wrong with the world and tried to tell the people who didn't know.   <br/><br/>Taxi Driver is one of the greats if not the best.   When I first saw it I thought Travis Bickle was a person who thought like we should about what should be done to the scum and Skunk Pussies on the streets.  I know that skunk pussy is the same type of word as scum but I really like that word.<br/><br/>What a film this is though.  Everything about it is just fantastic.  From the directing, editing, acting and the camera work which is what I loved the most as it takes you into all these different parts of New York whether it would be good or bad.   It's safe to say that Scorsese is obsessed with New York, being born and growing up there obviously has a big part to play, but his stories of New York whether it be Taxi Driver of The King of Comedy, they are just excellent.   <br/><br/>Jodie Foster was a huge influence I think here as she nearly out did all the other actors especially Cybil Shepard who was a big name at the time and all the trivia behind the movie is really interesting and makes you more apart of the film.  So if anyone has the DVD and haven't got the chance to watch the very long documentary all about The Making of Taxi Driver then please do as it will make the movie all the more interesting and watch able.   Harvey Keitel is as creepy as he is in Bad Lieutenant but says some pretty horrific things to De Niro when they first meet and Keitel is telling him what Foster will do to him for $10 is just sick but great as it shows the realism of what most pimps will do to a young girl for a cheap bit of cash.<br/><br/>Scorsese has been in the industry for five decades now and in the 70's the film that made that decade all the more special or him as a filmmaker was Taxi Driver as it is still as fresh as it was back and then and will continue to do in the near future.

","You can feel the power of the character of Travis Bickle throughout the whole movie because the perfect performance of Robert De Niro. A few actors can delivery such a great work, Marlon Brando, Sir Lawrence Olivier, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and recently Sean Penn. Of course you can feel the influence of the Actors Studio, the influence of Lee Strasberg.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese have created an amazing relationship with De Niro, since Mean Streets until Casino. The highlights are Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas and Cape Fear.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver deliver us the story of Travis Bickle, a veteran of Vietnam who is trying to forget the past and set a new life, with the beautiful woman who that he is falling in love. This seem to be easy for a normal guy.<br/><br/>But No for Travis. He is tired of the wrong things in live, like pumps, prostitution, scum's, thieves, he wish he could live in a perfect world. He meet Iris (and incredible young Jodie Foster) a little girl who is pimp by Sport (the great Harvey Keitel)<br/><br/>And he believe that if he save her maybe he can start to change the world. In little words Travis is a Hero. And of course he is a misunderstood.<br/><br/>In the final scene I only could imagine in Amadis the Gauda, one of the greatest characters of the ancient's knight novels. Travis Bickel is a Knight.<br/><br/>And use the violence to fight and erase violence. An excellent story, with such a great edition. Receive the Golden Palm at Cannes in 1976. A great honor!<br/><br/>Paul Schrader wrote an excellent script and Scorsese, the Master, has directed one of his finest works<br/><br/>One of the greatest movies of all of times. 9/10."

","Don't get me wrong I love Martin Scorsese's films and I regard him as one of THE BEST film makers around today, but one thing does bug me, and that is he used Robert De Niro so many times in his films. I'm not saying that he is a bad actor but you need to watch a De Niro film that is not directed by Scorsese.<br/><br/>Lets take the Deer Hunter, reagrded as a classic by many and when I started a film project I wanted to look at Scorsese and a tutor suggested I look at De Niro without Scorsese which I did. After watching the Deer Hunter I realised that De Niro was an over rated actor who Scorsese had made big, (in the same way that Spielberg made Harrison Ford a big name).<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a fantasic and ugly film that does not hold back, and well done to Scorsese for making this film, but the one thing I feel is that Scorsese should not have used De Niro, Harvey Kietel out acts him in the scenes they are in, (Kietel did the same in Mean Streets).<br/><br/>The actor I think he should have used was Steve McQueen, this would have made a very interesting combination as Scorsese films are about loners, and Steve McQueen it could be argued created an existental hero. While the film is excellent in itself I think the McQueen-Scorsese partnership would have been interesting to watch, (McQueen predicted that Scorsese would be big after watching his 1st film). Still this is an excellent film and I give this a 9 out of 10"

","This is definitely one of my top 5 films, De Niro and Scorsese always seem to produce such a deadly combination when they work together...I feel this movie grasps the sensation of loneliness so uniquely, accompanied by the memorable performance by The Great De Niro who takes this character and pratically becomes him. This film is a must watch!!! In this film you feel the sense of apathy that Bickle is feeling and by seeing the film through his perception only you can understand where he is coming from. Unfortunately, this film is a reality and truly gives its message across as well covering many disturbing issues in todays world...I recommend this film to anyone who hasn't yet seen it.  Look out for Harvey Keitel in this film although only a small role he is great for the short time he's on."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Taxi Driver is considered by many to be one of the most powerful films ever. And I have to say that they're not joking about it. I don't think that I ever have seen Robert De Niro act as good as he does here. He is Travis Bickle. Every one else casted here also stands for great performances.<br/><br/>The script by Paul Schrader is masterful. The story is about a man who can't sleep at night and takes a job as a cab-driver. All the filth and sleaze on the streets makes him dream about violently lashing out at it and clean the scum of the streets. The plot gives the public a foundation for some serious thinking and discussing: Is Travis Bickle good or evil? Can you justify his actions?<br/><br/>This movie is even by today's standards at times a very violent movie, but the violence is never speculative. It feels real and I guess some people might have a hard time watching it, but Scorsese makes sure that it's never unnecessary.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours on why you should see this movie: the camera angles are superb, the score is great and the feeling of it all is so real. But I won't say any more except that you have to watch this one. They don't make 'em like this anymore."

","I just saw Taxi Driver for the third time this evening. It's back on the big screen in Stockholm and I was asked by a friend if I wanted too see it with him. Although I had watched it before it totally blew my mind!<br/><br/>I Won't tell you too much about the plot since even the smallest spoiler still is a spoiler. Anyway, Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran suffering from insomnia. Since he has nothing better to do he decides to work as a cab driver at night, seeing all the filth and scum of the city thrive during his shifts. As time goes by Travis realizes he has to do something about it...<br/><br/>I suppose most people wouldn't consider this movie beautiful, but the beauty is really what blew my mind. The music, the streets, the camera and the acting, everything is just so tasteful you could eat it! This is probably mostly because of director Martin Scorsese, but he wouldn't have made it without Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel or Cybil Shepherd, all of whom delivers. The romance bit is, in my opinion, one of the best and most convincing ever captured on film. The chemistry between De Niro and Shepherd is awesome and everything just seem so natural and trustworthy.<br/><br/>Now don't you think this is just another of them boring love flicks! This movie got everything you want in a movie: drama, action, romance, great acting, and this tension that gives exactly the right feeling in your tummy and keeps you from getting bored. I recommend this movie to everyone daring enough to see something a little bit different from what we usually see in the movies today."

","Before ""Gangs of New York"", before ""After Hours"", before ""Brining Out the Dead"", Martin Scorsese directed ""Taxi Driver"", one of the most insightful and heartbreaking social commentaries every made in America. Featuring Robert De Niro at his most astounding, Cybill Shepard at her most vulnerable, and a young Jodie Foster at her most precocious, ""Taxi Driver"" succeeds in making the most sociopathic man imaginable into someone an audience empathizes with. As someone who has spent much of his life in NYC, I can certainly relate to Travis' feelings of loneliness and regret at an overwhelmingly bleak society.

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD: Taxi Driver is a character study of a very disturbed individual, Travis Bickle. We know the movie is building up to something, but unlike some movies where the only payoff is the climax, one can be fascinated with the journey into hell that Travis goes on, and which we tag along.  The film has few actual violent scenes, but the ones that it has really make an impact on the viewer.  The robbery scene is raw and disturbing, and the climactic 'attack' on the mob run whorehouse apartment is shattering.  Has any scene in cinema had the raw, disturbing power and ugliness that this scene shows?It is a gruesome ballet of death, like a train wreck in which we can't turn away. Some movies are filled with violent action from beginning to end, but the violence lacks realism or raw, shocking power.  By prescribing it in small intense amounts, Scorsese shows it for what it is - gory, ugly, powerful, fascinating, and not for fun. A popcorn movie this is not!"

","Martin Scorese's 1976 direction of Paul Schraeder's script `Taxi Driver' depicts the decline of civilization in urban America and one man's driven obsession to clean up the defilement. <br/><br/>The protagonist of the film, Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) cannot sleep at night and begins working twelve hour and longer shifts driving a cab in New York City. Bickle is a Marine veteran from the Vietnam era (although it is unclear if he ever saw combat) who through his daily existence observes the filth, scum and urban decay of the modern metropolis. An interesting part of Travis's observations and life is that he does not seem to notice, or care that he is a part of the same hypocrisy. He is disgusted by the city and its urchins and yet he drinks and pops pills constantly, is racist and practically lives in porno theaters during his off hours. Through all of this he reaches to try and find a real human connections.<br/><br/>Travis is obviously lonely and seeks to find the company of a woman. A presidential campaign worker, Cybil Sheperd, infatuates him and he does well with her for one and a half dates until his moment of undoing when he takes her to the movies. Sadly for Travis, he only seems to know about porno movies and Cybil quickly leaves him. Bickle also tries to befriend the concession girl at the porno theater (Diahnne Abbot) only to have her quickly call management to remove the harassing patron. The true find and motivator to action for Travis is the twelve year old prostitute played by Jodie Foster (Iris.) He runs into her a few times early in the action and later decides that he wants to try and rescue her from the world of drugs and pimps, particularly her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel.)<br/><br/>Nobody understands what is bothering Travis; not Betsy (Shepherd) or his fellow cabby, Wizard, played by Peter Boyle. Wizard seems to simplify all of the problems of the world into categories that work for him, like the notion that a man becomes his job and that all problems can be resolved by getting `laid.' Travis needs more than this to correct his problems.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb all around. DeNiro, Foster and Keitel are all brilliant. Cybil Shepherd plays her role well; there is a lot of depth in the character even though she is not on screen for long. Her coworker, Tom (Albert Brooks) is so totally annoying you just kind of hope that he enters Bickle's rage. The fellow cabbies are portrayed so well and given such great dialogue I really think that they are cabbies and not actors. Like Hitchcock, Scorsese always puts himself in his own movies. In `Taxi Driver' he has more than a mere cameo as he portrays a passenger in Bickle's cab who is hell bent on setting his faltering marriage straight with the aid of a .44 magnum. Even Travis seems scared listening to his rants and raves. Scorsese should act more often.<br/><br/>The climax is near when Bickle decides to meet with one of his colleague's friends, Easy Andy (Steven Prince.) Andy is the type of person that Travis is reaching out to destroy in this movie and yet he has no problem dealing with Andy because he will help Travis obtain the means to his end. Travis ends up purchasing a large assortment of heavy-duty handguns from Andy that he will use to invoke is reign of terror on the pimp, Sport and his associates. <br/><br/>The ending of this movie seemed unbelievably gory and violent at the time of the movies release, and it still does to this day. The main difference is that now in the post-Bundy, Dahmer, Hinckley, Chapman, Columbine, Susan Smith, 9/11 world it is not as shocking. Post-modern society has bred a number of people who have murdered indiscriminately for no apparent reason except of their overwhelming hatred of society and their inability to fit in. I have always seen Bickle as something more than this; perhaps as the rescuer of a kid trapped in prostitution and a cleaner of street scum. But we cannot overlook Travis Bickle's flaws and contradictions. Isn't he a part of what he eradicates?"

","Note... There are scenes depicted in this review if you do not want to know any scenes from this movie, please read this another time after you have seen Scorsese's and Deniro's great film... with that said...<br/><br/>Taxi Driver... the movie that people can only dream of topping. Travis Bickle is a taxi driver who has a overwhelming imagination about himself, and others and tries to save a pre-teen prostitute in order to do something worthwhile in his life. Robert Deniro was just great for the role.<br/><br/>this movie is just such a great portrayal of a man who cannot connect with human beings. his personality is one of many teenagers in high school and some even in college, who have been on the lower scale of the popularity chain. he has ideas and ideals that are good and true, but he just can't get them out properly without making himself look bad. he is very conscieous of his own image to such an extent that he is afraid to take any sort of risk, until the thought just drives him over the edge in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>To make the statement clear about his own self image, he actually goes out of his way in the movie to tell people that he was in the marines, or he's a narc, etc. he also goes to the porno theaters and just sits there playing with his hands as if they are guns. Travis loves guns and an occupation, or a role playing scenario of himself with the guns.<br/><br/>Travis is really this overgrown child who cannot communicate, but has great intentions. but his daydreaming sometimes got the best of him. his character is actually very attractive in many ways. its that type of character where if you see them, you think they are crazy, but you yourself would do the same behind a closed door. That is who Travis is. he is the guy just like any of us who cannot go beyond our mind barriers and our imagination because we seem to think that we cannot achieve those goals, or we would fail, die trying. Because Deniro has played such a great role, in such a great style of acting, it can be assumed, that he himself went through something of this magnitude during his own adolescent years. actors can only act their best if they have felt similar feelings to the ones that the character has. Deniro's personality, may not be exact, but can have aspects of Travis in himself, and that is just so cool about him. Deniro has taken himself, the side that never shows, and has shown it to the entire world. And most of us have always done things like role playing ourselves in the mirror.<br/><br/>Deniro was just great. Another thing that is great about this movie is that there is an hour and a half of pure story before getting into the coolest action scene (and memorable one) in cinema ever. this here is a great usage of buildup in cinema. This movie and the action scenes are very tasteful compared to other action movies nowadays.<br/><br/>SEE IT!"

","I don't care much for violence or vulgarity, and this film certainly has its share of both; but, in depicting a man whose downward mental spiral takes him to the proverbial gutters of New York City, these elements are difficult to avoid. Although it is definitely not for those who are easily offended by crude language or mature subject matter, the story presents a realistic view of, not only madness, but, grave depravity.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's portrayal of the crazed Travis Bickle is mesmerizing. Rarely have I seen a performance this good by any actor. He is simply brilliant, as is the score that accompanies him throughout the movie."

","""Taxi Driver"" was my first Martin Scorsese film, and I applaud him as well as his cast and crew for putting together a triumphant, first-rate drama. The dreamy, garish way with which he films some of the bleakest New York City streets I've ever seen is unbelievable. Combine this with a phenomenal musical score and raw, convincing character studies and you've got one of the best films of this - or any - decade.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro of course is fantastic as the disturbed, sympathetic character of Travis Bickle, a very lonely taxi driver for whom life is just a depressing, repetitive cycle; day-in, day-out...driving along the dangerous streets, haunted by its sick inhabitants, and driven ultimately to a terrifying physical/mental state that must be seen to be believed, Travis is easily one of the more memorable film characters I've witnessed in recent memory - realistic, vulnerable and heart-breaking. Watching him twist along through a winding path eventually leading to pure unabashed insanity brought a rare feeling of genuine concern, and disbelief. The people he meets and regularly socializes with every day, the awful conditions he's forced to put up with during the wee hours of the night...It just all seemed too perfect, the way this was put together, with its lingering images and lines, and unspeakable violence creating a shockingly convincing environment.<br/><br/>A solid film all around - well-deserving of classic status."

"randino101","Null","0","0","2 September 2003"," Outstanding.except for the ending
","Taxi Driver is one of my favorite all time movies because the theme resonated very strongly with me, loneliness.  Loneliness is a rampant problem being perpetuated daily by pop culture and big business controlled mass media.  Work long hours, make lots of money, get that trophy husband/wife, and God have mercy on your pathetic soul if you can't measure up to society's superficial expectations of who you should be.<br/><br/>
************************SPOILER ALERT*****************************<br/><br/>Enter Travis Bickle, a man that seems to have sort of fell through the cracks.  Perhaps a little mentally unbalanced, but not an intrinsically bad person.  He's in desperate need of a good friend or two, and a decent woman to be with him.  I can relate to Travis a great deal, except for the racism. `Loneliness has followed me all my life.  The life of loneliness pursues me wherever I go: in bars, cars, coffee shops, theaters, stores, sidewalks. There is no escape.  I am God's lonely man.'<br/><br/>Watching Travis solitarily drive and walk through the inner city New York streets, you could almost swear there is some sort of outer force preventing him social acceptance (the hand of God, magnetic repulsion perhaps?) Always at the wrong place at the wrong time, Travis just can't win.  I've been in those shoes myself, and let me tell you man, it ain't no fun.<br/><br/>
Travis's condition could be due to a combination of things such as lack of education, improper upbringing, negative experiences in the Vietnam war, and overall bad luck. We don't really have enough info to know why Travis is the way he is. All we know for sure is that Travis has been pushed around and screwed over for long time.  This is what leads him to say  `Listen up you screwheads: . Here is a man . who wouldn't take it anymore'.<br/><br/>
My only beef with this movie is in the ending.  In my opinion, it should have ended when the cops came into the apartment building and saw Travis going `Pgghew! Pgghew!'.  When I first saw `Taxi Driver', I thought all of the subsequent scenes were part of a dream sequence.  It wasn't until I later read the script that I knew otherwise.  Somehow, Travis does not get charged with murder.  I can understand why Iris's parents would think he is a hero, but the fact remains that he still killed three people.  The last scene in which Travis picks up Betsy in the cab also appears out of place. It seems almost as if Schrader and Scorcese had to soften the ending as to not scare away some top studio brass for funding this project.  In any event, `Taxi Driver' does make a powerful statement about the dangers of loneliness, and should be remembered as one of the greatest movies ever made."

","It seems that a lot of people do not think a whole lot of that movie (a lot do, otherwise it wouldn't be so high on the top 250 list). I think this is maybe because this may not be a movie that you can particularly joy. Travis is a character in a dead end life seeking purpose, and is disgusted with his surrounding environment.<br/><br/>How many of us at once have been disgusted with the filth of our surroundings, or been disappointed with humanity as a whole? How many of us have found a person who we thought was an exception, only to inexplicably lose that person? Travis Bickle was an intriguing character because he was a peculiar combination of elements- moral righteousness, as evidenced by his treatment of Jodie Foster's character later in the movie, general naivete- as evidenced by his interpersonal relationships, especially with Betsy- and desperation and frustration with his own existence, manifested in going over the edge- as seen at the end of the movie. He was lashing out at the world, but did not know how. I think that his character, and also the superb acting job by Deniro, and the camerawork and script engineered by Scorsese, made the movie amazing. There's something about Travis Bickle that all of us can relate to in some fashion or another, and the creation of such a character on its own distinguishes this movie from the rest. The ending left something to think about, and the entire movie showed flashes of frustration at the lack of satisfaction in life, which we all feel at some point. 10 out of 10."

Travis's rejection is the rejection that we feel in relationships with friends and sexual partners.  Many ask, why did he take Betsy to a dirty movie?  Travis is a part of the very filth he wishes to eradicate.  When Martin Scorsese is in Travis's cab, telling him he's going to kill his wife, this is the personification of his exposure to the city.  The depth of the corruption of every man makes Travis Everyman.  ""I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention.  I believe that someone should become a person like other people.""  This is Travis's ""walking contradiction.""  Don't be superficial when watching this movie.  Watch it alone, with alcohol.  Realize that Travis exists inside of all of us -- he makes stupid male mistakes, he functions inaptly on his own, he lives in a world he feels is disrupt with filth.  In the end, Travis is the hero, or anti-hero, because he actually succumbs to his human urges and subjugations.  He's the hero, because this world, in this film, is fu*ked up.

","when i first saw Taxi Driver, i was overcome with different feelings.  i was disturbed by the way New York was presented. a chilling vision of the way in which the city transformed into a seedy underground full of scum ""like an open sewer"" at night. jodie foster's performance as the twelve year old prostitute only added to how dark and hell - like a place New York may have been at that time, or at least through the eyes of Travis. De Niro's performance is simply outstanding. it's unclear whether or not he is intended to be recieved as a hero or as a villian. he seemingly plots to kill Palantine, at one stage and takes it upon himself to wipe out what he considers to be scum. however on the other hand he is standing up for what he believes in and although his very existence has been warped by his isolation as a loner, he shows honourable human qualities such as caring for iris, and at one stage caring for betsy. ultimately he is a violent individual and therefore dangerous but the audience can't help but feel sympathy for him. all the performances throughout this movie as brilliant. if anybody as seen mean streets, the contrast of character that keitel manages to portray in these movies is testament to the great actor he is. cybill shepard, jodie foster, albert brooks and peter boyle all give top notch performances also. the brilliant talents of scorcesse, De niro and Schrader are what make this movie so moving and brutally realistic. a very dark and gritty out look on life but well worth the watch as it is possibly the greatest movie ever made."

","SPOILER AHEAD!!!<br/><br/>
Through its underworld milieu, themes of existential angst, chaos, violence, and meaninglessness, the film Taxi Driver is part of the film noir genre. Directed by Martin Scorcese, the film Taxi Driver delves into the bleak life of Travis Bickle (Robert Dinero), a lone taxi driver from Manhattan. Following the tradition of the film noir movement, this film is dark in every way. It uses themes of existential angst, alienation and loneliness, chaos, violence, and disillusionment. As the film digs into Bickle's transformation into his own sick idea of a hero, these themes become more and more apparent. There are also other characteristic noir visual preoccupations, such as water, the darkness, and mist. In addition, being a neo-noir, or `new noir film,' it ties in issues of the day that are important to the mindsets of people that lived in the 1970's. In this way, this film is unique.<br/><br/>
The most obvious part of this film that fits into the noir movement is the visual style. I will discuss later how even though this film is in color, (most of the early noirs were black and white) it keeps the same concept in terms of visual style. Dark city streets slick with water from broken fire hydrants, prostitutes, drunks and murderers: an overall sense of trashiness. This is what film noir aimed to show: a gritty look at American life. What differentiates this film as a neo-noir is that it pits a misfit against the underworld, or  as Bickle explains: `All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal'. As Bickle drives aimlessly through the streets, everything he sees is evidence of the underworld at work. There are long shots of Bickle's point of view as he stares at these creatures. One striking example is in a café scene, in which there is a static shot of Bickle's point of view as he stares at a pimp, who is shot unflatteringly from below. This shows Bickle's disgust with the underworld, and preempts his actions toward the end of the film. Bickle's disgust with urban life, especially in New York, is a general theme in film noir. There is a horror in classic film noir at urbanized life, and in Taxi Driver, it is intensified by Bickle's intense feelings.<br/><br/>In addition to the gritty look of film noir, another characteristic of its visual style is the constant use of water. This creates symbolic meaning, as well as enhances the milieu by identifying it as film noir (dark city streets and rain soaked pavement). But, Taxi Driver uses a different meaning for water. In films such as Chinatown and The Man Who Wasn't There, death is associated with water, making it a symbol of helplessness and drowning in life. The meaning becomes apparent in Taxi Driver through Bickle's narrative: `April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks' . Water is a symbol of cleanliness in the film, what Bickle is striving for. He develops an intense anger towards what he feels is the scum of the streets. Frequently he encounters water, such as when he runs through the stream from a broken fire hydrant with his cab. This shot is followed by a shot of the windshield wipers wiping the water off the windshield: another visual clue indicating cleansing. Water is a preoccupation in noir, not only because the streets are always wet, but because characters frequently meet near a port or the ocean, etc. It holds different meanings: cleansing, life and death (the rising and falling tides), and life (water is needed to live).<br/><br/>
Water is not the only reoccurring visual; there are symbols provided by normal city objects such as signs and traffic. In many critical moments, such as when Bickle attempts to assassinate Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris II), signs such as `No Pedestrians' or `No Parking' appear in frame. It seems that not only are people impervious to Bickle, but signs and objects in his environment contradict him. In this example, he is in a particularly hostile mindset, and for the first time, we see he has shaved his head into a Mohawk; the sign helps contrast his ignorance toward rules (he wants action; he has to do something about the `trash') with the rules. Another good example of this is the sign hanging in the taxi garage that reads: `BE ALERT!! THE SAFE DRIVER IS ALWAYS READY FOR THE UNEXPECTED. SLOW DOWN AND GAUGE SPEED TO ROAD CONDITIONS. YOU CAN'T STOP ON A DIME!' This is another implicit indicator of Bickle's life spiraling out of control. The sign seems to indicate that he is trapped in life, and cannot seem to get himself out of the filth that he despises so greatly. He is stuck in it, its all around him. In the film, he states: `All my life needed was a sense of direction, a sense of someplace to go. I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, but should become a person like other people'.<br/><br/>The irony is that he is never ready for the unexpected, because he works outrageously long hours, and sees his only purpose as keeping himself busy. The sign identifies the rut that he is in, telling him to be `alienated' and `slow down.'<br/><br/>
To intensify Bickle's emotions without symbolic meaning, another visual component is used: expressive lighting. The low-key lights of the streets are used frequently as a backdrop, and the few primary colors included in them are used in tinting certain sequences. The film is predominantly red, as Bickle has a score to settle and plans to kill to do so. An example of this is when he walks out the café and sees a prostitute yelling at her daughter. The entire street seems bathed in red light. As he gets in his car to pull out, it disappears. Primarily because this film is color, it uses light in a different manner than black and white shadows used in typical film noirs, but uses it to similar effect. Black and white noirs use shadow to convey mood and possibly hidden motives, while neo-noir such as Taxi Driver, tend to use color in the same way. The neon lights and car headlights of Manhattan seem to envelop Bickle.<br/><br/>
Characteristic of later noir films such as Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly (1955) is extreme self-reflexivity. There are certain time cuts used in Taxi Driver, such as when Travis looks at his cash box in the garage, the camera tilts down, and then in the same shot, he picks it up on the other side. By limiting the view of the action, the camera calls attention to itself.<br/><br/>There are some shots that convey Bickle's loneliness and alienation in typical noir tracking shots. The most prominent example of this is when we see Bickle trying to talk things over with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) after their failed date. The camera starts out on Bickle, and slowly tracks right to the hallway, and eventually focuses on an open door as he slowly realizes that she does not want to see him anymore. It signifies their relationship leaving. through the door, and also makes Bickle seem even more pathetic and alone. Film noirs make use of a lot of these complex tracking shots and stagings to reveal information through characters interacting with their setting. In Laura, this is particularly evident with long, static shots that use the setting to convey information. Objects such as paintings, stairwells, and endless amounts of doorways help accomplish this by creating symbolic shapes when characters interact with them. These settings are usually complex, and contain many seemingly random objects which have the tendency to be symbolic.<br/><br/>
Like many other films in the noir movement, this film has the dark, gritty visual style that is most easily recognized. But, it is also an update on the movement's preoccupation with the horror of modern urbanized existence. Bickle's disgust with New York city intensifies that of the movement in general, creating a modern (negative) take on urban life. Taxi Driver is neo-noir because it creates an outlook on urban life from the unique view of the 1970's. Only people who had been alive during this time can understand and create a film like this. Events such as the United States' failure in Vietnam are evident in the film: Bickle served in the Marine Corps during the war. This film is a unique neo-noir because it revisits the extremely negative view of urban life found in earlier film noir through the viewpoint of the 1970's."

","Regardless of whether you have seen Taxi Driver, you have been probably been impacted by it.

This now cliched bit of dialogue is lifted directly from Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver, refined to its purest element, is nothing more than the character study of an alienated man looking to validate himself.  This in mind, the plot initially seems too lean for it to be deserving of its acclaim.  However, this simple concept is executed so precisely that one can not take his mind off of it, even long after the credits have run.  Travis Bickle's (the protagonist) character quickly becomes its own entity, and he soon ingratiates himself with the viewer.  This is thanks to Paul Schrader's writing and Robert DeNiro's performance, both of which are brilliant.<br/><br/>A plot summary beyond what has already been stated is not necessary.  See this movie.

","A filmic monument to the phenomenon of post '60's American alienation and disillusionment.  Whether or not it is a 'favorite', it cannot be denied that it is of historical importance - sitting roughly between the attempted assasination of presidential candidate George Wallace and the attempted assasination of president Ronald Reagan.  I believe the movie was somewhat informed by the Wallace incident, and of course it is fact that William Hinckley, Jr. found a perverse model in the irresistable Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>
De Niro's Bickle is appalling and unforgettable in his seething inarticulation.  His downfall is conveyed with epic scope, using diary entries and voiceover (over a period of approximately three months!)to demonstrate his naive microcosm as he is cumulatively thwarted by strangers and remains perpetually alone. His warrior identity emerges early on in the film and the horrific denoument, whether deemed 'too violent' by some, is organically realized.<br/><br/>All performances are extraordinary, from Peter Boyle (The Wizard) to Jodie Foster (Easy/Iris). Bernard Hermann's score provides a sultry New York ambience and Scorsese's direction is flawless.<br/><br/>I give this film 10/10."

","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>Despite some disturbing elements, Taxi Driver, one of many acclaimed films from the legendary Martin Scorsese, is a real winner. Scorsese does an incredible job illustrating the bad side of New York, a place full of dopes, pimps, and hookers. It is a place where war veteran Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) works everyday, always observing the rough activity that goes on as he escorts several people, some of which are mentally ill and crazy. Travis longs deeply for someone to come and eliminate the foul events that occur in the street. He is a shaky person who is hardly in touch with anything that goes on in the world, and he spends his time attending porn movies and writing in his diary, always describing life as it goes on and sometimes changes. Despite his image and his slight mental problems, Bickle is actually a very truthful person who often knows what is right and what's wrong. Bickle spends most of his time watching campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and convinces her to go out with him. His liking for her causes him to take interest in the same things that she likes, and things go well for him. But Travis angers Betsy after he takes her to an XXX movie, and she falls out of touch. This and a few encounters with teenage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) make Bickle want to take action. He purchases a set of guns and makes up many interesting ways of drawing them out, such as a track on his arm that will make the gun slide into firing position when his arm is cocked. His first step towards redemption is the murder of a man who holds a convenience store clerk at gunpoint. Bit by bit, he gets darker in personality. He attempts to murder presidential candidate Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), whom he told he supported only because he wanted to become friends with Betsy. But he realizes that Palantine is not a worthy candidate, and is only stopped by a bodyguard whom he had spent time shooting the breeze with beforehand. He later meets pimp `Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel), who uses Iris and her friend as hookers. Travis arranges to have sex with Iris, but only to convince her that she is leading the wrong kind of life. After much persuasion, Iris and her friend begin to follow his lead. Bickle later shoots Matthew and the other people who control Iris, and she returns to her parents. He is seriously hurt, but he recovers and continues his job. Travis is hailed and praised by many newspapers and people, but he takes it in stride and returns to the regular life of hanging out with his taxi driving pals and cruising the streets, just like always.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver, put shortly, is one of the greatest films of our time. I loved the dark aspects of the film that Martin Scorsese put in, and the story is inspiring. Robert De Niro delivers a remarkable portrayal of the classic Travis Bickle, a truly one-of-a-kind character. This movie will make you cringe a lot, but that doesn't derail the film's greatness. It has the ever-famous dialogue (`You talkin' to me? You, talkin' to me?') that millions upon millions of people have repeated, ridiculed, and adored. The whole film is brilliantly put together, and I recommend it. However, there are some rather disturbing scenes, and the violence was a little over the top and gross. Anyone who is sensitive to violence or strong sexual scenes probably shouldn't check this out. But truthfully, those two elements are the only things that kept this film from getting a perfect score from me.<br/><br/>

The Taxi Driver is one of those five.<br/><br/>I have heard many people complain that the film is too violent, or too disturbing. I disagree, I feel that all who share that view have missed the entire point of the film and are ignorantly ignoring the importance of the messages displayed in the film.<br/><br/>Underneath the wonderful exterior (the film is beautifully written, directed and acted) is a deep underlying message which is communicated to the viewer through the deeply emotional and violent scenes that build up towards the end of the film. You will have to decide on the message of the film yourself, as just about everyone who will ever watch this film will understand and relate to it in a different way.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. De Niro is in his finest role (better than The Godfather II) and the young Jodie Foster shows qualities that most actresses twice her age cannot display.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is one of the most memorable characters in modern day cinema and, even in his most violent and un-emotional moments, you really care for him and you worry about what he might do next, in case something bad happens to him. The connection I felt between Travis and myself was terrifying, but made me love the film even more.<br/><br/>So, is it the best film ever?

","There may be a handful of American films that are better, but in my opinion ""Taxi Driver"" is the United State's most significant contribution to the world of cinema. Travis Bickle is what we have left as a protagonist in a world when heroism is dismissed as passe and empty. He is as endearing as he is disturbing. Like Cybill Shepherd's character, we've never met anyone quite like him. But we understand him. We feel his frustration and his suffering. It's the frustration of those living in an isolationist culture that tries to make islands of all people. Travis is God's lonely man, just as some could call Americans God's lonely people. I know I'm reading a lot into it, but in my opinion the central themes of ""Taxi Driver"" stem from the darker, alienating aspect of American culture. It's so much more observant in it's depiction of failed American values than other films. ""Citizen Kane"" is a film about material greed and loss of innocence. Travis is also seeking innocence but his greed is not for corporeal things but for love and acceptance. For a chance to contribute to people's lives. His suffering is greater than almost any other character in American film and literature, because he seems to understand what is truly valuable in this life (justice, self-respect, love) but is driven mad by his inability to attain them. Do I recommend this film? No. I demand that everyone sees it at one point in their lives. It's that important."

","Taxi Driver was the first Scorsese film I saw and while I definitely appreciated it, it's not his best in my opinion. The plot sometimes feels a little bit long-winded as there's not much actually happening and I feel that DeNiro's character could have been explored better. It is a very fascinating film, though. The scenes set in nighttime New York must be some of the most atmospheric ever and DeNiro is of course excellent as usual. After I'd seen it I realized what an impact it must have had on film-making. One thing I can't get, however, is how Iris can stand drinking orange juice while eating a sugared jam sandwich? If it's intentionally symbolic I can understand it, but if it ain't I find it mighty puzzling. Do all americans have orange juice and extra sugar with their jam sandwiches?

","As with every film ever made there are those who like that film and those who don't like it for whatever reason. What most people don't understand when reviewing films is that different people enjoy different types of film. An invisible barrier seperates these two factions of people and very few can actually understand that even if they hated a given film every person has the right to an opinion.        After reading numerous comments from Taxi Driver it finally clicked that people need to be more tolerant towards others and that just because somebody didn't enjoy it doesn't make it a bad film. What makes a great film is that an overwhelming majority of people who have seen it enjoyed it. Now getting back to Taxi Driver, this film is absolutely outstanding and is one of the key turning points of 70's films. I can understand that people may not warm to the violence and unfriendly look at modern life but few can deny that this isn't a well made film.<br/><br/>     The standard of acting from Robert De Niro and to a lesser extent Jodie Foster is remarkable and very few actors would have the natural ability to become Travis Bickle as De Niro does. What I find noteworthy of the best of De Niro's films is the way he tries so exceptionally hard to become that role. For example in preparation for this role he actually got a cab license and would drive around and pick people up. Other examples of this is in The Untouchables where he even got Al Capone's tailor to dress him.<br/><br/>
     The film is deservedly one of the greatest ever made and ranks very high if not at the top of the best films of the 70's even when there is the likes of The Godfathers, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and others to contend with. <br/><br/>     With repeated viewing especially now it is hard to understand why Hollywood strayed from this standard of film making and went into the over the top and abismally made which has dogged the cinemas every since.

","The direction is great and even though Bickle's character isn't written all too well he really makes the character.  Its no surprise that i have never heard to the character refered to as Travis Bickle in conversation, only DeNiro, or Deniro's character.  Either way, his presence on screen is prolific and is reason enough to be interested in his character.  However good the direction is (and it is, the film is shot in a very modern style with fast cuts and odd angles for its time) the story is ultimately lacking...  The story is a huge buildup for little pay-off.  I wonder if this is because the studio and censors would not allow for the big ending we all expect when we watch this movie but for whatever reason it is short and unexplained (and a little unrealistic.)  Before the halfway point i was sure i would love this movie and probably buy the dvd but unfortunately it wasnt what i expected.  Not to take too much away from the film, i still think it was groundbreaking and probably underappreciated but you can't help but wish there was more to it."

","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a 26 year old Vietnam veteran who has insomnia. Taking a job on at the taxi depo, he begins to focus his anger and disgust at the underbelly of New York City.<br/><br/>
   His anger subsides when he meets campaign worker Betsy (Cybil Shepherd). He sees her as the only sign of purity in New York, but Travis' inability to properly communicate with others lead to the relationship being terminated. He then meets Iris (Jodie Foster), a twelve year old prostitute. He is disgusted by this fact, and is determined to save her, despite the fact she does not want to be saved. Travis' downward spiral erupts in explosive violence.<br/><br/>     Director Martin Scorsese has created a film that blends together so well, that the term ''endlessly watchable'' was probably invented for this film. Watch out for the many subtilties that indicate where Travis is heading. The seedier side of New York is captured in all it's glory (!) bygiving the film an almost documentary feel. Credits to cinematographer Michael Chapman for this.<br/><br/>     Acting wise, nobody puts a foot wrong. Jodie Foster, although in a small part, shows us the raw talentthat eventually matured into two Oscar wins. Shepherd is understated, yet sympathetic. De Niro: what can I say? He may have won the Oscar for Godfather II, but this is his defining role. He inhabits Bickle and makes him a character that we can sympathise with, even as he goes on his rampage. <br/><br/>    Special mention must go to Harvey Keitel, as Sport. By giving him some little oddities, such as long hair and a pink fingernail on his pinky, he evolves the character into something much more memorable. To think that, in the original screenplay, he only had five lines. <br/><br/>    If I was being critical, I could criticise the ending, saying that it was implausable, but sit down and think about it. There is a reason for it there. <br/><br/>  Overall, a classic that will be rightly revered in fifty years time. <br/><br/>I give Taxi Driver a 10 out of 10."

","In my favorite Robert DeNiro movie ever, Martin Scorsese introduced us to the mind of a man with a serious wannabe-hero complex. Wonderfully shot and conceived, this film was one of those movies where you have to see to believe. While his scene has been mimicked and mocked so many times, seeing DeNiro perform his mano-o-mano bravado routine on his mirror is still fresh and cool, even today. While many of Travis Bickle's tendencies are unclear, its all about his reactions to the people surrounding him. How Bickle responds to everyone else in the world is really quite priceless. And to think, Jodie Foster was doing Disney films at the time. It's really hard to analyze a film that has been analyzed to death. Nonetheless, this film will be remembered forever."

I have suffered from insomnia since I was 14, and one night, around three or so, I noticed Taxi Driver was on so I decided to watch it.  I will not give away any explicit details of the film for those have not seen it, but for those who have, I'm sure you can imagine what sort of effect this had on me.  I spent the next hour with my kidneys aching from the adrenaline rush caused by the shootout.  I experienced more emotions throughout the duration of this film than I had in the past three months. Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader created a work of art, not just a film, that goes deep inside the human mind, or rather, what happens when it finally snaps.  Robert DeNiro is beyond a doubt the only person who could play Travis Bickle.  His performance in this film is by far one of the best ever; he certainly deserves his recognition.  Also, I was extremely impressed by Jodie Foster.  Even at her young age, her talent is more than apparent, it's almost disturbing.  Her portrayal of Iris was incredible, better than anything I've seen from most actresses. A brief summary: If you haven't seen this film, watch it right away, YOU ARE MISSING SOMETHING!!!"
"edwjoolee","Null","0","0","15 July 2002"," Bleak, violent and uncompromising
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is not a comfortable film to sit through. It is dark, disturbing and uncompromising in its portrayal of a desperately lonely man on the verge of psychosis. The setting of Taxi Driver is New York, and as in Midnight Cowboy, it is shown as an urban city that, while superficially is bustling and teeming with humanity, is also an uninviting place of sin, corruption, crime, despair and loneliness.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro) lives in that city, and, at the beginning of the film, finds work as a taxi driver to escape sleepless nights. HIs work as taxi driver takes him to every part of the city, allowing him to come in contact with all sorts of people, especially the unsavory kind---e.g., pimps, prostitutes, thugs, robbers, etc. Initially, he views all the goings-on in the city and its denizens with a sort of detached cynicism and contempt, seemingly as an outside observer looking in.<br/><br/>However, his uneventful life takes a turn when he falls for a political campaign worker named Betsy, played by the beautiful Cybil Sherpard. There is a telling scene on their first date in a coffee house where Betsy quotes a song lyric to describe Travis as a ""...a pusher and a poet, a walking contradiction"", whereby Travis somewhat angrily responds,""are you saying that about me?..I ain't a pusher and I ain't never pushed..."" The scene, aside from showing the naivete Travis possesses, also reveals a sort of truism of Travis' character: He IS a character full of contradictions. Here is a man who rants against the filth of the city---the prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, etc...---and yet spends his solitary days in a porn theater (and once even tries to pick up the ticket girl). Or, that he takes the conservative Betsy to a porn movie on their first night on the town, which prompts her to run out of the theater, insulted and hurt.<br/><br/>Travis' descent into psychosis becomes markedly pronounced after his breakup with Betsy immediately following the porn movie incident. He becomes more withdrawn and increasingly consumed with irrational thoughts. He also hooks up with a 13 year old prostitute whom he had met earlier briefly and tries to be the self-designated guardian and savior to the street-savvy girl, trying desperately to steer her life around. (I wondered if he was doing that out of genuine compassion or because he saw a sort of young Betsy in her, corrupted but stll salvageable, unlike Betsy who is ""just like the rest of them"") All the while, he concocts a plan which is clearly, or at least in my mind, a desparate attempt by an unhinged mind to get back at Betsy.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is incredibly unsettling. All I will say is that the the scenes will uncomfortably be lodged in your mind for a few days afterwards upon viewing the film.<br/><br/>The performance by Robert De Niro is impeccably played and is the heart of the film. The viewer sees through his eyes, and lives and breathes through him for two hours. There is not a faltering moment in his portrayal of this complex, emotionally-charged character.  And the city of New York has never been shown with such realism, its ugliness and beauty both inhabiting the same world in a sort of discordant harmony so typical of modern city. Ultimately, Taxi Driver is a psychological roller-coaster ride filled with bumps and twists, and the viewer will be emotionally drained by the end of the film. A modern cinematic achievement."

","I loved the film. The biggest reason why, is that unlike most movies involving death and violence, the viewer gets to experience the mind of the character, as well as the actions. In the film Travis keeps a diary this is often narrated letting the viewer see what the character is thinking and why. Another reason I enjoyed the film is that the plot was more realistic than a lot of films. This sense of realism made more of an impact on me for the emotions were not masked by a far-fetched plot or story, the plot reinforced the emotions and the emotions reinforced the plot. The genre Taxi Driver is in is ` Late 1970's: Psychological Portraits'. The violence that the Travis performs is tied back to the beginning of the film when the viewer learns of Travis' experience in the Marines and Vietnam. The disenchantment is focused on one character Travis Bickle who is fed up with the society and the environment that he is in. His troubled love life and loneliness are shown as a way to lead up to the action in result of the disenchantment."

","To be really honest, when I first saw this film, I didn't know what to think of it. There is something there, but just can't put my finger into what it actually is. When I watch it a second time, that is, straight after watching it the first time, I start to understand what and why the film is so great. It is kinda hard to explain it in a few words, but the movies done back in the 70s is alot different from the ones done nowadays. There is depth in this film which is not found in many modern films. For example, nowadays, if you want to film a overhead shot like in the last scene, we can simply use computer technology. But what they did was actually punch a big hole in the ceiling to put the camera! The camera work is done very nicely but you may miss out its brilliance if you do not know what to look for. For example, in the beginning when DeNiro was in the Taxi Company, the camera scan him watching on the right and it doesn't follow him but rather do a circle around the place and catches back with him when he leaves the door.<br/><br/>
I must admit that this film will not be fully understood if you do not know the backgrounds. So I strongly suggest if you are fortunate enough to have a DVD of this film, watch the 'makings of', I am sure you will learn alot more.<br/><br/>What truely stands out of course is Bobby. I really admire his dedication to his job. He doesn't just go in and act, he actually studies his role and spends alot of time praticing. He even got a taxi licence! How about that.<br/><br/>The central ideology in this film is the theme of loniness. And even though the film is very bleak, the surprising result of it is a moral one. If many people can relate to this film, it means that you are not alone in being alone! So the great depression each of us faces each day is nothing speical, it is part of the human conditions."

The film is violent and shocking in places, but it resonates with a deep sadness for the ceaseless motion of the city. It threatens numerous false endings, which give its eventual conclusion an uncomfortable lack of finality.  As we hear a letter from Jodie Foster's parents being read across images of DeNiro convalescing, we sense that no grand justice has been achieved, that she has returned to a crushing family she originally fled, who will ominously make sure such an escape ""cannot happen again"".  Neither love nor salvation wait: driving away in silence at the end, DeNiro has found some peace in a world that remains restless and brutal, but this remains a city whose desires are vague, nocturnal, and ceaseless.  Scorsese refuses to close his film with the the cathartic simplicity of shining-gun violence, and the American love-affair with firearms takes its place as another urban fantasy, another symptom of deeper sickness which can end life but which has no power to resolve its complex pain."

","Moody and near sheer flawless depiction of an isolated, aloof former war veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), who spends his nights in New York driving a taxi cab, sees the endless amount of low-lives (prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, etc.), and slowly becomes determined to make his presence felt throughout the city.<br/><br/>Furthermore, what makes this movie leave such an unforgettable impact on the viewer is how director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader set-up the jungle-like atmosphere and I begin to get the feeling that the people like Bickle are animals, not the same type.  Is everyone who lives and works in the Big Apple almost identical?  Not absolutely.<br/><br/>Even the views of the night life in the city, that are provided by cinematographer Michael Chapman, reminded me some of the Renissance paintings that I saw in high school.  It's just beautiful, simple as that. And the musical score, which is the last one composed by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (""Psycho"", ""Carrie"") is something that you want to listen if you aren't a big fan of modern music.  The music flows to a slow, but smooth jazz rhytmn and I bet a (high school or college) music teacher would love that.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the performances are definitely memorable and de Niro himself isn't alone.  Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, Cybill Shepherd, and Harvey Keitel round out the marvelous cast.  Plus, Scorsese himself has a nice cameo as an unhappy passenger who tells Travis what he wants to do.  That scene alone and the mind para-lyzing climax, which I wouldn't dare throw away, pick up where ""Death Wish"" left off with the revenge factor, and take it to staggering heights.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Taxi Driver"" does teach the viewer a valuable lesson that shouldn't be forgotten, period.  It makes you think about what you choose the way you live and view any situation.  A wake-up call, at best.

","Those four words are the best I can use to describe this film.  Very few times in film history has there ever been a character as real as Robert DeNiro's ""Travis Bickle"".  Anyone who has ever gone through a period in their life of loneliness or isolation can relate to Travis Bickle.  The only fictional character I can think of that has the amount of depth and authenticity of Travis Bickle is Holden Caufield in the novel ""Catcher In The Rye"".  In fact, I can see many similarities between the two characters. While Holden Caufield's mental breakdown did not have the consequences of Travis Bickle's, they both shared many of the same character traits.  Both had dark, cynical views of the world, both were tremendously charming, but at the same time lacked the social skills to benefit from their charm, thus both were extremely isolated and lonely individuals.  Both were extremely respectful towards women and held them to the highest esteem.  I guess you can say Holden held an advantage in intelligence over Travis, as Travis held a slight advantage in confidence over Holden, but still, I can see many similarities between the two characters and am surprised no one has made the same comparison.<br/><br/>The film itself is a brilliant character study and a gritty and unforgettable look at urban life.  Scorsese's vision of New York's urban jungle from the front seat of a taxicab is one of the most mesmerizing film experiences you'll ever witness.  The film also features a career establishing and gutsy performance by a 14 year old Jodie Foster as the pre-teen prostitute that becomes Travis's focal point of redemption in the movie.  Cybil Shepherd's performance as Betsy, the fixation of Travis, is tremendously underrated.  She pulls off just the right amount of grace to Travis's charm to make this film work.  You can feel the instantaneous chemistry between the two characters.  If only Travis had the social skills!<br/><br/>There isn't much else I can add to this movie that hasn't already been said by the other people who've reviewed this, but I can say that this is my favorite movie of all-time and a movie that never seems to lose it's power over repeated viewing's.

In a time when that theme was so trendy, Scorcese manages to face that theme and escape from the cliché of the patriotic movie, where the americans are the good guys and the eastern (always treated as communists) people are the bad guys, the oppressing dictators. When watching this movie, you get the message of what the war does to one's mind, without looking at war pictures (after all, the action is in NYC, there the war is another) and see the inner battle of a struggling man urging to release all his destructive energy and killer instinct.

","Taxi Driver is one of my favorite movies. Robert De Niro is brilliant as the mentally disturbed, yet universally lonely Travis Bickle.  Jodie Foster is extraordinary as the 12 year old prostitute Iris, vengeful towards her parents.  Martin Scorsese did a ground breaking movie, not for the violence, but for it's powerful impact as a humanist story in a way of speaking.  Upon first inspection of this film, I really didn't know what to think about it. I thought it was unnecessarily violent towards the end, and thus thought the murder in the film was ludicrous and pointless.  But I watched it again the next day, and discovered something about not only Travis, but New York.  New York was a disturbing place back in the 70's according to Bickle. Even though New York is ""cleaned"" up modern day, the story and characters are not in anyway outdated.<br/><br/>The picture quality of the televisions, the fashions and background of New York City may feel outdated, but they are materialistic things, not the actual core of this story.  Loneliness is their just as much as it is today, and the feeling of this film are universal.  The film doesn't senselessly indulge into a preposterous plot or negates from its character, and that gives us time to associate with Travis.  We all feel like him at one time or another, and our central protagonist is a chilling yet touching person to watch.  He thinks about assassinating a Presidential candidate 24/7.  He is an avid porn theater attendant so much it drives the only person that may care for him away, and he feels the way we all ultimately feel: Alone.<br/><br/>This film isn't old or ever will be, because things truly never change. Their will always be ""Travis Bickles"" in the world, because a room is always filled with a hopeless guy in the corner hoping to be noticed and appreciated.  Travis's attempt to save Iris is somewhat of a contradiction; since no one will save him, he must save someone who at one time asks to be saved but doesn't fancy the idea afterwards. Even though Travis is around people while driving the cab during the night shift doesn't mean he is appreciated or noticed.  He feels like Iris screaming for help, yet no one seems to answer.  Travis knows that he has to answer because it is only fair to another person that you would treat them as you would like to be treated.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro became one of my favorite actors after I saw this film, only acknowledging him as a ""respected"" actor to that point.  But I finally realized that I identified with his character and felt whole again knowing I wasn't the only one who felt alone.  Being accepted isn't everything or the material things, only the feeling of yourself.  Five stars out of five."

","Is Travis Bickle a villain, an evil person, a bad' guy, wicked?  Not really.  He's a good person through and through who has been pushed beyond his limit and has gone insane.  Now that he has gone insane and become a villain' or killer as far as the law's concerned--morally he's still in a state of limbo. How much killing three leeches will shade a basically decent person's grayness into the black is very questionable indeed.  In fact, certain people might say that his grayness is still shaded towards the white.  He's killed 3 people who most people wouldn't mind seeing get run over by a truck anyway.  If you you were sitting on a jury, however, and you voted to let Travis off, you would be wrong.  Just because someone's killed certain degenerates you don't much like doesn't make him any less of a killer and justice has to be served, even if there are extenuating circumstances.<br/><br/>So is it possible to call this guy a hero? Yes and No, but neither in any conventional sense; he's an absurd tragic hero' who's had to go insane to act out his heroism,' or he's an absurd tragic villain' driven to kill who is, in fact, the nicest of men!   From one point of view, the whiter shade of his grayness is literally hanging by a thread, and from another, the blacker shade of his grayness is barely visible.<br/><br/> If he had killed the politician instead, his grayness would certainly shade enough into black for most people to consider him a villain, but then again, politicians aren't exactly that far above pimps now are they?  People have used the term anti-hero' to denote this type of absurd hero,' but that's as meaningless as labeling him an anti-villain.'  Take Don Corleone, or better yet, Michael Corleone, as an example.  A lot of people consider a part of what Corleone does as a sort of heroism,' a twisted way of fighting the powers that be, the system.' Does this make him an absurd villain' or an anti-villain' or conversely maybe even an absurd hero' like Bickle? Both views are possible but the former can easily be seen to dominate. Corleone's a villain with his grayness shaded way out into the black but with enough sympathetic white elements to make him an extremely tragic figure and therefore interesting.  What's special about Travis is what happens after the killings: the extreme difficulty we have of placing his grayness as either leaning towards the black or towards the white."

","Taxi Driver is one of my fave films and remains one of the best flicks ever made.  Marty's direction is flawless, Robert's acting is outstanding, Paul's screenplay is magnificent.  The pain of rejection from society, from New Yorkers, from women, from everyone and everything it seems fills the character of Travis Bickle.  I know all to well what its like to be driving by couple in your car like Travis does and seeing every guy you pass with a beautiful girlfriend on his arm.  When it seems everyone else seems so together and you seem out of place.  A thumb in a world full of fingers. Travis is God's lonely man and we feel for him.  I remember lines like when Travis muses aloud about the Cybill Shepherd character: ""I realize now how much she is just like the rest of them.  Cold and distant.  Many people are like that, women for sure.  They're like a union.""<br/><br/>
When you see where Travis took the Shepherd character for their first date, however, you kind of have to laugh at why he can't realize altogether why she rejected him.  I've known some women you could take to an X theater on the first date, don't get me wrong, but Cybill's character in this flick is not up for that.  Not on the first date anyway.<br/><br/>
But humor aside, this film retains all of its raw, emotional impact it had when it was first released.  I saw the 20th anniversary re-release into theaters back in 1996.  I remember I was 26 yrs old at the time.  The same age as Travis is in this film.  Weird.  That added an extra connection to the film for me.  Plus the way Travis' crummy apartment was strewn with Doritos bags and Big Mac containers and the way Travis walks into a store to buy some milk and a six pack of donuts before shooting an armed robber is something I have done many a time in my life as a bachelor.  Getting the donuts, not the shooting thing.  But anyway, see this film.  See it soon, see it now.  It lives, it breathes, it is cinema at its finest.  Rock on Travis, baby.  I got the sense at the end of the film his near death experience ahd strangely purified him.  I felt a similar way after seeing this picture.  Over and out..."

","As in all Scorsese/Deniro collaborations, they bring the best out of each other. Even Bringing out the dead could have been a good film if Deniro had played the Nicolas Cage role in his younger days. Deniro got the Oscar for Raging Bull, but he and Scorsese have never dived as deep into the mind of an unstable man as they did with Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>The support cast is a perfect backdrop to the seedy world Travis is revolting, particularly Harvey Keitel as the pimp Sport. Even Cybill Sheperd isn't as hammy as she has been in the past and Jodie Foster is just as electrifying as she was in Silence of the Lambs, if not better. The FBI now ask any murderers if they have a link with the film, such is its power and hypnostic influences.<br/><br/>The film cannot really be fully appreciated on first viewing, the plot spins you away from the study of Travis and his rejection of the world, but on second sitting the plot is entertaining but irrelevant, the psycho in front of the mirror is.<br/><br/>Rent it, buy it, borrow it, nick it if you have to, just make sure you see this film.

Harvey Keitel is wonderful and the sleazy, manipulative pimp Matthew 'Sport'.<br/><br/>But Robert De Niro is, of course, the dominant role in this film. His unstable psyche is slowly revealed, but his near-total lack of social skills and weird behaviour is seen early on. But we don't see the extent of them until circumstances (Cybill Shepherd's Betsy and a character played by Scorsese himself) and his decisions drive him right down to the bottom.

"ggoodm","Null","0","0","10 May 2000"," but did you feel it?
","After going through the 85 reviews or so on this film, I feel very proud. People have done an extremely good job of explaining the brilliance of Taxi Driver and the emotional experience that it evokes. And although I have little to add in those areas, I do have another perspective that I hope will be of interest. Probably the one aspect of being a cinephile that I most enjoy is finding a connection between two filmmakers that I really like. It helps explain my reaction to their work---as if to say, it's only natural that you relate to this film; this filmmaker likes the same films as you. In these terms, Taxi Driver has been a tremendously rewarding experience. Watching it again, this time as a more knowlegable cinephile, I discovered connections that I'd overlooked in the past. A couple of these observations, I think are particularly revelatory, and I'd like to share them.<br/><br/>But before I do so, know that these are merely conclusions that I have drawn and that they are by no means fact. If you agree, great. If you learn something, great. If you don't agree and don't learn anything, well, I hope you at least enjoyed the read.<br/><br/>Although Mean Streets is my favorite Martin Scorsese film, I think Taxi Driver is far more interesting from a stylistic standpoint. More than anything, I say this because of Michael Chapman's cinematography---the lighting, the framing, the camera movements, everything. Coincidentally, in recent years, of all the young cinematographers, I have been most impressed by Christopher Doyle and his work with the Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai. I love the way he captures the big city and have always felt that there was something truly original about his work.<br/><br/>Until recently, however, I was unaware of any precursor to the Christopher Doyle style. I thought it was one of those artistic breakthroughs that come without warning and defy all claims of artistic inheritance. But then I re-watched All the President's Men. In the work of Gordon Willis, I recognized those blues and reds and greens that I had always attributed to Christopher Doyle. And now that I've gone back and watched Taxi Driver, I see that Michael Chapman was responsible for many of the other things that I'd always credited to Christopher Doyle. In 1976, he gave the nocturnal city a new look---revolutionizing the way the streets shine and the signs glow and the colors all blend into one another.<br/><br/>Like I said before, findings like these are one of my greatest pleasures as a cinephile. When I like a film, I want it to mean that I've been moved. Recognizing similarities like Doyle-Willis-Chapman enables me to continue filmgoing as an emotional experience. I like a certain kind of lighting. When a film is lit that way, I react. It's not a theory. And I don't have to justify my tastes in any intellectual manner. And for me, that's why I became interested in film in the first place---because it affected me emotionally. That said, back to the game of uncovering parallels between the work of Wong Kar-Wai and Martin Scorsese. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite Martin Scorsese film is Mean Streets. It's not the filmmaker's most stylistically characteristic or even most impressive work, but it is my favorite. I respond to it more than to any of his other films. It moves me, and I care about the characters. Taxi Driver, on the other hand, because of some of the truly anti-social flaws in Travis Bickle's character, leaves me cold. I don't fully respond to Travis' plight. He never exhibits the positive qualities that I need in order to be fully taken in by a character. And he doesn't ever give me a good reason to be sympathetic towards his loneliness.<br/><br/>I've never fully responded to Taxi Driver on an emotional level, and now I understand that it is because I don't relate to Travis Bickle. Yet I still like the film. This paradox---liking a film yet not caring about the central character reminds of Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express.<br/><br/>
When I first saw Chungking Express (the first Wong Kar-Wai film I ever saw), I thought it was cool. Its style was new and intoxicating. But I didn't feel totally satisfied. Wong's mysterious swapping of central characters left me confused and kept me from fully implicating myself into his story. I wanted more from a film.<br/><br/>Then I saw Days of Being Wild. Although it lacked the excitement of Wong Kar-Wai's signature style, I found myself responding much more deeply to its characters than I had to anyone in Chungking Express.<br/><br/>And now it all makes sense. For a long time, I fell into one of two traps. I would see a film knowing it was classic and if I wasn't moved, I would think that I had missed something. My defense mechanisms would be set in motion and before I knew it, I'd be convincing myself that I had also thought it was a classic. Or other times I would base my opinion of a film entirely on a film's surface. I'm not saying that any of the previous reviewers have fallen into this trap, but with work of unusually exciting style like Taxi Driver (other examples include Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, The Wild Bunch, or Clockwork Orange), it is a likely pitfall. From here on out, and I don't think it'll be easy, I hope to live by the following---if the film moved me, I liked it. I don't care if it's a classic or not."

","I watched ""Taxi Driver"" in the wee hours of the morning one night when I was stuck on some hellish late shifts that I absolutely despised. I think that all of us know or have run across at least one Travis Bickle in our lives. The one I know was my father. Over and over again, as I watched the film, I was struck by how much this looked like what my old man would think or what my old man would do. Obsessed with guns, porn, and drinking, casually lying his @$$ off to anybody and everybody, having grand plans that ultimately come to nothing--that's Travis Bickle and that's my old man. As portrayed by De Niro (one of the greatest actors who ever lived, bar none), it is obvious that Travis' problem is not New York, New York, the human sewage he wants to flush down the drain, or even his tour in Vietnam. His problem is himself...one that he can never escape from, though he tries (watch that final shootout scene and see if you don't agree with me).<br/><br/>The ""happy"" ending is, while unrealistic, very appropriate. Bickle's reward for the good deed of his life is...nothing. Not jail time, not escape from New York, nothing he's been aiming for or even deserves, in the case of jail time. He's just gone back to his meaningless, grey existence, where he'll no doubt remain for the rest of his life. Maybe he'll snap again and go on another rampage; so what? It won't change anything about him. This is the life he's stuck with...for good."

","*some spoilers* This film is a good example of what Scorsese and De Niro can do when they are given good material. Acting, music, editing, all help to create an interesting story. Many scenes in the film are very strong in the way that they stay in the viewers mind long after seeing this film. I remember the, apparently authentic, scenes in the beginning of the film that show the streets and although very brief they create a sort of feeling of authenticity that sets the tone for the film. I remember reading that Scorsese had to use authentic footage because they ran out of money making the picture. <br/><br/>When it comes to the accuracy of the portrayal of mental illness in the film, I would like to believe that there are certainly worse efforts. The film tries to tackle the mental grey area that really isn't about sanity or psychosis but about the area between these two. I think the film puts more emphasis on the sane part of the human mind and on what that part allows. The film is far from perfect, but rather than as a documentary the film should be seen as a fictive story that is actually very close to reality.<br/><br/>The last 3 minutes of the film that show the ""happy"" ending to the story has bothered me. Rather than as reality the end after the shootout should perhaps be seen as Bickles' last thoughts because I think he dies. Why would everything be so rosy, certainly he would not be considered a hero after what he had done by any kind of court? The film is done almost entirely from the point of view of Bickle and that is what I think the ending and the film is about, the subjective experiences of this man and his life in this sometimes inhuman city."

","Travis Bickle *is* Shane, only instead of living in the mythical old West, he lives in a real New York City where the separation of good and evil is not nearly so clear. Both Travis and Shane come from a violent past of which we never really get to learn anything about. They yearn for women they can't have, they recklessly venture to dangerous places, they find moral strength in the eyes of a child. They would like to start a new chapter in their life and leave the violence behind, but they both find that impossible as a final confrontation results in a classic shoot-out.<br/><br/>When Shane in the rancher's bar says ""you speakin' to me?"", it is an obvious villain who answers him ""I don't see nobody else standing there"". When Travis Bickle asks this question, he answers himself. The real world does not have obvious villains. Having been through a war and living in the hard reality of New York City, Bickle has completely lost the ability to understand the ways in which society can tolerate some evils while refusing to accept others. Good and evil become clear only when the world is seen through his delusions. Believing he has recognized evil, he is now capable of becoming good. Unlike Shane, however, his tormenters come entirely from within and cannot be slain with simple violence. Welcome to the real world."

","I might be told I exaggerate too much, but I would rank this film as one of the 5 best films in history. And not because of Scorsese though he is one of the best. Not either because of DeNiro, also one of the best. It's because of an extremely underrated writer and director: Paul Schrader. The film is basically about loneliness. Travis Bickle is completely isolated from society. He lives in his own world: taxies, porn movies and taxies again. The relationships with Betsy and Iris are what really moves Travis. With Betsy he wants to integrate in this society, feel part of it, although he already has the idea of "" cleaning up the whole mess.....and flush it down the f**kin' toilet "". With Iris, this idea is more of a reality. He wants to save the prostitute from hell. In this way, we could see the influence of greek mithology ( orpheus and Eurydice ) in Taxi Driver, although it has many other clear influences such as The nausea, Sartres existencialist novel or The Searchers, John Ford's western. Anyhow, Taxi Driver is a marvellous film thanks to a magnificent trio( not duo ): Martin Scorsese, Bobby DeNiro, and Paul Schrader."
"The_Movie_Cat","10","0","0","3 February 2000"," Still important after all these years...
","I've been drawn to revaluate this film recently by four critical opinions other than my own that made me question my initial judgement.<br/><br/>The first was hearing a story on tv that I've never come across before: a governing body forced the filmmakers to colorise the blood in the climatic final sequence to a lighter, less graphic colour. This explains why DeNiro's neck spouts orange blood as the effect unfortunately turned out to be irreversible.<br/><br/>Secondly I read a magazine review that highlighted DeNiro's performance. Normally negative criticism of such a revered actor is never dared uttered, yet this particular review suggested that there was nothing ""behind the eyes"" and that DeNiro's performance was all surface and definitely no substance. <br/><br/>Lastly, I recently lent the tape out to two friends. One returned it to me half-watched, it's mid-70s pacing (none of the much touted scenes of violence taking place before over an hour) boring him. The other friend brought to mind quite a valid point. That we never see exactly what makes the DeNiro character, Travis Bickle, psychopathic. On first viewing I perhaps appreciated the characterisation more as what seemed a slightly disaffected young man gradually became warped by the decadence and hostility of a harsh New York. The genius of the film is that you follow his descent into insanity and see things through his eyes. We hear his thoughts, we get to read his journal, his presence dictates the movie. So much so that we almost support his mission to ""eradicate the scum off the streets"", we almost cheer when he shoots a store raider dead and we agree with his justification for murdering the pimps who harbour a 12-year-old girl into prostitution. Then it hits us. We have followed, willingly, a man into a mass execution and the violence, which we have mentally encouraged, is displayed graphically before us. It causes us to question our own sense of morality and that is why it is such an important film.<br/><br/>Except on second viewing it is quite clear that Travis is mentally ill from the outset. The world of New York doesn't consume him, he reflects it. An alienated, socially inadequate man who takes a girl on a date to a pornographic movie. My friend questioned that there was no impetus, no genuine cause of psychosis, but that Bickle is psychotic from day one. Maybe this was a race interpretation. My friend is Asian, and perhaps had been fortunate enough never to encounter the extreme, right-wing WASP mentality that is prevalent in a thankfully small minority. The Travis character is racist, homophobic, misogynist, he rallies against the ""pushers"" and the ""skunk pussies"" that litter the streets. In many ways his views are not those of the mentally disturbed, merely those of  `middle America'.<br/><br/>The similarly-themed ""Falling Down"" fails for me, chiefly because of it's self-conscious and incongruous bouts of humour, but also because it has nothing to say. Taxi Driver has plenty to say. Maybe what shocks about the violence (tame by today's standards) is it's moral ambiguity. The ultimate ironic play-out, that a murderer should become a hero, leads us to look again and question ethical behaviour. How different is the self-righteous from the wretched? What distinguishes the viewer from the `scum' of the movie? One of the most subversive pictures ever made, it ultimately carries no distinction between right or wrong and it's lead character is completely unsympathetic, an extremist who attempts murder for no other reason than personal notoriety. These are important issues it raises, and it succeeds as it doesn't spoon-feed its audience, but throws up a myriad of questionable motivations. Just how different is Bickle from the clientele in the back of his cab?<br/><br/>Taxi Driver succeeds over populist fare such as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs as, fine films though those may be, it occupies a space of reality that they can't, or don't wish, to encounter. Plus Scorcese gives a better cameo than Tarantino ever did. <br/><br/>Without question one of the ten or twenty greatest films ever made. In MY opinion, anyway..."

","Taxi Driver is the kind of movie in which I'd like to have been beside the screenwriter while he was typing it out. It feels like it was written half out in one sitting, the other half two months down the line. We begin with Travis Bickle as a young, somewhat unthreatning character. He is unvilont, doesn't lash out or raise his voice, like he was uneffected by Vietnam. The odd thing is, somewhere along the line, he breaks down. But we don't see that as clear as we should, because we can't tell if he's disturbed to start with. All of a sudden, this calm little 'vigilante' lashes out in a violent way. What happened? He hates the city? He doesn't have to stay there. If he doesn't know that, is that why he's 'crazy'? Who knows. Then why, you ask, do i think its one of the ten best movies of all time?

","""Taxi Driver"" is an absolutely harrowing journey into the world of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a lonely, confused ex-Marine driven over the edge by the world around him.  Bickle is a terrifying character, but also quite sympathetic; you feel sorry for a man so lonely and depressed that he would turn to what he does.<br/><br/>An underlying theme of the film is that, with the world (especially in this decaying, crime-ridden pre-Giuliani New York) going to hell all around us, we react to it in different ways.  Some, like a man who spies on his cheating wife (a surprisingly effective cameo by director Martin Scorcese) harbor fantasies of lashing out but do not, as far as we can tell, act on them; Bickle cannot show such restraint.<br/><br/>The biggest shocker is the ending; while the climax is, as expected, violent, the aftermath is completely unexpected.  Without giving too much away, all I will say is that it illustrates how America celebrates the violent loner at the same time as it fears him.

He means no harm, but in his attempts to impress her, he only succeeds in driving her away.  After the disaster with Bestsy and the chance encounter with the Senator she works for, Travis suddenly has a purpose in his life. The film starts to move quicker as Travis prepares for his mission.  He becomes more and more removed from society.  His face reflects a simple minded goal.  His attempt at assassination goes bad and Travis decides he must save Iris, the 13 year old prostitute he met.  The film becomes a bloodbath as Travis shoots everyone he sees in a sleazy hotel.  Scorsese's view of New York is a gritty, violent one.  DeNiro perfectly captures the malaise that many people feel in large cities.

","Taxi Driver is a stupendous film, one of the only one's that gets better the greater number of times you watch it. It has been lambasted by a minority of people, though, because it doesn't have a plot. Well frankly, this is a character driven film, not a plot one, as most of Scorcese's films are.<br/><br/>
The reason that the character of Travis is so universally understood by audiences is that what he does and how he lives could be done by any one of us reading here after the traumas that he has been through. He was in 'nam, people tend to ignore him, he's got a dead end job, compared to those people around him he is a nothing. As are nearly all of us at one point or another in our lives. That is why, apart from the brilliant direction and camera shots, the loneliness comes through. And also because of DeNiro's performance. Don't get me wrong here, I am not a DeNiro-phile. In fact, I think I am possibly one of the only people in the world who thinks that he is over-rated hugely as an actor, preferring Depp and Pitt to him any day. But HE IS TRAVIS BICKLE. He is the sum part of everything.<br/><br/>This film needs to be looked at through open eyes joined to an open mind. And when I've had enough sleep, my eyes are constantly open.

","Taxi Driver is the perfect cinematic example of a lonely soul. Travis Bickle is so alone it drives him crazy. Bickle tries to understand everything, but can't figure out anything because his judgement is so completely blurred. Bickle's idea of a date is dinner and a porno film. Robert De Niro turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and Martin Scorsese is at the top of his form. Paul Schrader's script is deep with character development in the right areas. I find the most interesting aspect of Taxi Driver is the Bickle characters obsession with the women in is life. Cybill Shepard plays the Madonna and Jodie Foster is the underaged whore. It seems like Bickle treats each woman as the other, showing just how complicated Bickle has become in his self pity and loneliness. All this frustration causes Bickle to comprehend an act of violence, his first attempt, he chickens out. Then out of more anger because the first act of violence didn't pan out, the second attempt at violence is extreme and insane. Scorsese, De Niro and Schrader have created one of the most interesting and complicated films in cinema history. One of the great films."

","What a movie.  De Niro's performance is excellent and one of his best career performances, Scorsese's directing is great as well and last but not least, Bernard Hermann's music is perfect and could not have been chosen better.<br/><br/>  De Niro is Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who can't sleep at night so decides to become a taxi driver at night.  You then see all the horrors he has to live each night by seeing a few of the people he has to pick-up especially the man played by Scorsese. He plays a disturbed man who wants to kill his wife because she has left him for a black man. <br/><br/>
  Bickle falls in love with a political worker, Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), but their affair does not work out after Travis unwillingly makes a stupid mistake (I won't reveal to you what the mistake was, you'll have to see the movie to find out for yourselves).  We then realize he has been very affected by the Vietnam war as he somewhat becomes paranoid.  He then tries to save a twelve year-old prostitute from the world in which she lives and his attempt leads to a violent ending.<br/><br/>  ""Taxi driver"" is a great movie and of the most powerful one in years.

","WARNING!!! POINTS OF PLOT ARE GIVEN AWAY!!!!!<br/><br/>If there was a more poignant moment in film history than the panning of the dead bodies and the guns that have just caused their deaths, I don't believe I've seen it yet. The scene speaks enough for a film itself and is the perfect way to end the film. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a great film that shows the kind of reaction one might develop to increased isolation from society. A lot of time in this film is spent on showing Travis (DeNiro) in his apartment quite literally losing his mind. After what must have been many terrifying incidents for the Vietnam vet, the return home has brought no relief, rather more new problems instead. The problem now  are all of the drug dealers, pimps, hookers, polititians and just about anyone else that he doesn't know. He looks at the streets of the city and only sees evil and decay. Travis sees degeneration all of the time, and decides that he must take action ( a line in the film goes something to the effect of ""I know what I am supposed to do, this is my calling"" ). From here on everything changes and the audience is enveloped in the whirlwind of events to come.<br/><br/>The film itself is one of the best shot, not as much for the murky underkeys of the New York streets, but rather for the effective use of new camera techniques. Near the beginning of the film, the camera pans over different parts of the taxi, never showing it as a whole. This could be a metaphor of the trouble going on inside of Travis (rendering him an incomplete person) or simply to show the troubles of society as a whole. The hall shot while Travis is on the phone with Beth (Shepherd) is reminiscent of Kubrick, while the overhead shot after the graphic ending sums up the film quite nicely. Scorsese even puts a decent performance as an irate husband who seeks vengeance for his wife's misdeeds (another good example of the filth of society).<br/><br/>I don't understand why Scorsese added the end scene, giving nothing while not taking away anything either. The meetings with the fellow cabbies could have also been taken out of the film completely. It would have added an even further sense of isolation to Travis. More screen time should have been given to the Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel characters who were both much more interesting than the cabbies or Cybill Shepherd. <br/><br/>This film runs a good length and has few dry moments. I prefer Raging Bull to Taxi Driver because of Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty who each give the main character more reason to rage out, rather than the indirect effects of society. I would also like to note that many people have felt that the violence in this film is Scorsese's darkest. I would have to disagree saying that both Goodfellas and Casino are far worse.<br/><br/>Full recommendation.<br/><br/>8/10 stars."

The story is unpredictable as is the mind of Travis.  Robert De Niro demonstrates his brilliance in character interpretation under he flawless direction of Scorsese.  The grimy underside of New York (but it could just as easily be Sydney or London) is gutted and exposed for us to explore through Travis's jaundiced eyes.

"Doc-134","10","0","0","21 May 1999"," The Taxi As A Metaphor For Loneliness and Alienation
","Few movies have the ability to be so vivid in terms of imagery that you can recall every single scene with the utmost of precision. Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" is one such film. This film is such a powerful exploration into the tortured depths of a man's soul that I doubt if I could even forget one minute. In fact, this is one of Martin Scorsese's great strengths. Many years after ""Taxi Driver"" he created his signature freeze frame shots to highlight important scenes and images, as a way to extend their importance. Scorsese does not use freeze framing in ""Taxi Driver"", but it is hardly needed. He bombards us with many other image trickeries that reflect Travis Bickle's (Robert DeNiro) alienated and agonized psyche.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" should not be viewed as a film about urban decay, even though it does take place on the filthy streets of New York City.  The film is more of a character study depicting one lonely man's struggle to live within the filth and corruption that surrounds him. Travis can not stand the place in which he resides, but he has no means by which to escape it. To an extent, Travis may even be drawn to the decaying world of the streets where he drives his cab because it is here where his anger and frustration is fed. Deep down, Travis is kind-hearted good person. He sees the urban decay around him and desperately wants to do something to change it. In one scene, Palantine (Leonard Harris), the man running for office, rides in the back of Travis' taxi. Travis tells Palantine that he would like to see someone in office who could clean up the streets of New York. ""I'd like to see it all flushed down the toilet"", he states.<br/><br/>The act of cleansing is an image that recurring throughout the film. We often see water from hydrants spraying the streets. Travis also cleanses the back of his cab after ever shift. In the narration, Travis says that he has to often clean blood and other bodily fluids from the back seat. What he has to clean from his cab represents the violence, pornography, and prostitution which is everywhere. Travis cleaning his cab is symbolic of his desire to clean up the streets.<br/><br/>The taxi is integral in developing Travis's dissociated, and isolated self. The taxi is used as a metaphor for loneliness. Many people from all walks of life use taxis, coming from and going to their various destinations. The person who drives the taxi is an outsider, isolated from the many lives that he sees coming and going every day. In this respect, ""Taxi Driver"" reminds me of T.S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"", a poem about the anxieties of the modern world. In the poem, the speaker sees the city as a place where anonymous people come and go in transition to other places. The taxi in the film is similar in that it is a mechanism by which people anonymously travel from one place to the next. Travis is the outsider because he is stuck in this mechanism, just as Prufrock is stuck in the vast city landscape with ""restless nights in one-night cheap hotels"". But Travis is not only trapped in the confines of the taxi, but also the modern city, disillusionment, and disappointment standing in the foreground, just as Prufrock is.<br/><br/>The taxi is often shown in fragmented parts. A detail insert will be shown of the mirror, then a cut to another detail insert of the back bumper, and so on. This fragmentation of the taxi is symbolic of Travis's alienated self. To break down the taxi illustrates that Travis's life is not whole. Something is missing. He has a need to make a connection with other people. He sees people everyday in the back of his cab, but they are people that he will likely never see again. He, just like anyone else has a need for love and acceptance, but sadly enough has little chance of getting it. Travis, one day sees Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), an attractive woman working in a campaign office. He asks her out and she reluctantly accepts. Travis is so much a part of the filth and scum that he detests,  he does not know better than to take her to a porn theater on their date. ""Everyone goes to these theaters"", Travis tells her when she rejects him. Travis seems to be able to spot everyone else's dirt but his own. He is part of the world that he truly despises, and even when he tries to get out, he can not.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, Travis's loneliness continues to grow. He desperately needs to reach out, but the city is full of women that he can not have. We can see that Travis is developing some kind of pathology as he lives out his pointless and routine life as a taxi driver. His confused state of mind is exemplified in the imagery that Scorsese presents on the screen; an example being a detail insert of a glass of water with bubbling seltzer. As well, the blurred city street lights are representative of Travis's life being distorted. About half way through the film, we have the famous image of Travis pointing the 44 magnum in the mirror, and the famous line ""Are you talking to me""? This is where I would say the turning point occurs. At this moment we know that his craziness, resulting from the streets, the loneliness and rejection that he suffers everyday is going to lead to a violent confrontation. The pointing of the gun in the mirror is brilliant. The image illustrates that anyone could be his victim even us, the audience, metaphorically speaking. But he is not only pointing the gun at us, he is pointing it at himself, as if he desires some sort of self-destruction. This is a great fore-shadowing scene. It would be unfair to give away who the confrontation is with and how it ensues. All I will say is that it revolves around his attempt to help a young child prostitute; Iris (Jodie Foster), get off the streets. This is another attempt for Travis to reach out.<br/><br/>I am so tempted to give away some of the ending because there is one shot that I consider to be among the best in cinematic history. It is a slow overhead shot that occurs just before the film ends. Unfortunately, if I say what is shown in the overhead shot, I will have no choice but to give away what happens. But trust me, it is a moment worth waiting for, an I guarantee that you will never forget it. I must not forget to mention that a new edition of ""Taxi Driver"" has been released, both in the wide screen and pan and scan format. I highly recommend the wide screen version. Anyway, it has some great documentary footage on the making of ""Taxi Driver"", with interviews of Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader (screenwriter), Robert DeNiro, Cybill Sheperd, Jodie Foster and a whole host of others.<br/><br/>

","A real modern-day drama cleverly directed about the universal theme of the average urbanite's loneliness. The first scene I enjoy is the meeting and the intense dialogues of the pre-""Maniac"" Joe Spinell as the cab dispatcher. Then, the Travis Bickle's alienated character and his inability to communicate and share with others. For instance, the relation with his colleague, Wizard (Peter Boyle), in the café is important to understand his behaviour and the close-up of the aspirin glass symbolizes well-enough Man's distress. Remember this existentialist monologue : ""I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention. I believe that someone should become a person, like other people..."" The burning desire to get out of his own nightmarish routine life is in the utopian relationship between him and Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who both come from very different worlds. Violence frees himself from his schizophrenic impulses. He becomes the cold exterminating angel who gets rid of the devilish-pimps in one of the most terrible manslaughter. Remember this determinist monologue : ""Now I see it clearly, my whole life is pointed in one direction... I see that, now. There never has been any choice for me..."" Robert de Niro's tour de force performance with his best-remembered monomaniac monologue : ""You talkin' to me ?"" belong to every film fans. The importance of the guns as iconic props is showed when the nihilist, Travis Bickle, uses a sleeve-gun gadget inspired from ""The wild wild west"" series. Martin Scorsese's performance is funny as the cuckhold husband with his 44 Magnum. Bernard Herrmann's dreamlike and haunting music emphasizes the theme of the obsession which is, unfortunately, his last score. Michael Chapman's sharp cinematography makes the New York City location hellish. The whole mood of the film is scary, realistic, violent and sordid. Dan Perri's title design makes the opening and end credits just weird and outstanding."

Onto a more artistic commentary.  The writing of Taxi Driver is impeccable, as it is a very personal story from the heart and mind of the brilliant Paul Schrader.  The direction, well, it's Scorcese, so do you need to know anything else? This is one of the consummate films about alienation and urban decay (as paralleled by the inner decay of DeNiro's Bickle).  There have been pretenders to the throne, but anyone who knows an iota about film cannot deny (or is foolish if he or she did) that this disturbing film resides forever in the damaged soul of anyone who has ever felt the slightest bit outside of the moral and social mainstream."
"Dave-506","Null","0","0","20 April 1999"," Travis Bickle- Psychopath or Vigilante?
","A Psychological Perspective of Taxi Driver (1976)<br/><br/>With Scorcese directing, with such titles as Mean Streets (1973) and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974); it was not entirely unusual for the character to be any less than perfect than expected by the conscientious likes of Hollywood. Scripted by Paul Schrader, Taxi Driver gave Robert De Niro a chance to show the world his consummate acting abilities as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran turned psychotic vigilante. The film generated controversy on its release for the topic of extreme violence centering on the character Iris (Jodie Foster), who happened to be a twelve-year-old prostitute was needless to say a topic found disturbing to those used to typical Hollywood principles. Scorsese knew he had only a small but dedicated following, so he was prepared to take certain risks making his films only on a relatively small budget. The rebellious pairing of Schrader and Scorsese allowed a film and character to be extraordinarily less rounded than the Hollywood counterpart made the same year, Avildsen's essentially bigoted and racist, but paradoxically enjoyable  Rocky. Hollywood isn't interested in the narrative; it's more fascinated with the concept of hero. However, Travis is humiliated about his job and therefore himself and so therefore possesses less heroic qualities than the character played by Stallone. Travis has an imaginary and delusional occupation in where he works' for the government: in his depressed monologue he reads a letter to his parents: `I would tell you my address but the secretive nature of my work forbids it.' This particular sequence where we hear Travis telling a white lie is the very point in the film where he knew he had to make a `stand against the scum' on the streets. His parents would think he was someone of importance in society rather than the continuing image of a son that perpetuates in a sub culture which society despises. But we can actually see the true Travis Bickle driving around the hostile environment through the attributed hallucinatory misc-en-scene. We witness this filmic confliction as we see him and his cab in shallow focus (therefore in great detail) and the rest of society is simply blurred in a colourful but disorientating array. The audience sees red, green and amber lights emerge and quickly disappear though they were splashes of a passing of Travis's (hazy) memory. Every passenger is the same to him the only difference to his routine is the changing of traffic lights. It is suggested that he is pointing the blame of society's ills on what Travis calls the `Whores, Fairies, Junkies and Queens' of the New York street culture he has to dutifully serve. Travis later adds that, `Someday, I hope that they'll all be washed away. Perhaps he feels like Noah in Genesis here because sinners, miscreants and people of diseased reputations have become too much for him to tolerate and he feels that it would be God's justice that they should all be swept away by a great flood? Travis later again mentions at home in his diary monologue, `I am God's only man' so therefore he is His servant. An important key in understanding his anxieties is within the conversation with Wizard (John Boyle) when he wisely said: `The job becomes the man / you become the job.' Therefore Travis would feel inadvertently raped at regular intervals when he had to clean the blood and come off the back. The next scene we see a purchase of an arsenal of weaponry, shaking off the old Travis (Noah) and suddenly acquires a deadly vendetta against all those that sicken him. So that the world was free of less evil and it would be a safer place for people like Iris, but personally it is likely he had scarred his mind after the terrible conflict in Vietnam. In the reason why he wanted a job as a taxi driver, Travis reluctantly says to his future boss: `I can't sleep nights'; insomnia and regular nightmares are the very key to an unhealthy mind. So Travis decides not to sleep but his job inadvertently causes his hatred of society, and becomes sicker still as the days pass by until he vents his rage and crumbles within in the process."
"vbz","9","0","0","20 April 1999"," The only flaw is the ""epilogue"".
","Scorcese must have known his Dostoyevsky well, and not strictly in the positive sense. In a decision of startling audacity for the seventies, he created a modern-day Rascolnikov as an emotionally scarred Vietnam vet, plunging into greater madness at the very core of the world's rotten heart: New York City. One who develops his own agenda of redemption, and eventually becomes a near automaton set to eliminate all that he hates at any cost. De Niro, as Travis Bickle is no more a mere promising talent, but a true revelation, a paragon of male urban despair, a picture-perfect definition of a walking timebomb. His metamorphosis into a killing machine is incredibly vivid and tense, a performance that glues to the screen and transcends all boundaries, making you revel in its very depravity and rejoice in the sublimely staged climax through which De Niro almost sleepwalks, blinded by uncontrollable obsession. This is interactive cinema: the kind that takes the viewers' senses into full custody and does not release them until the very last moment. Jodie Foster, unlike Dostoyevsky's fallen saints, plays her part with bitter cynicism combined with hidden vulnerability, a far more appropriate behavior for a teenage prostitute. Bernard Hermann, the man who brought you the ""Psycho"" soundtrack creates an equally memorable score. Yes, ""Taxi Driver"" would have been an all-around 10, if not for the final three minutes.

","A Catholic priest named Joseph Pirrone, who is an old friend and former teacher of Scorsese, complained that the biggest problem with Marty's movies was ""too much easter Friday, not enough Easter Sunday."" Indeed, with the obvious exception of Alice Hyatt , and the possible exceptions of Newland Archer and fast Eddie Felsom,very few of Marty's characters experience real happiness, or earthly salvation.The most  that most them do is to survive ( Though we are to assume that one of them IS resurrected). So far, most of Scorsese's film have been tours of the circles of Dante's hell. ( He has said that this will change in the future.) One of his most harrowing tours of the Inferno is Taxi Driver.I first saw this horrific masterpiece on the big screen ten years ago.It remains burnt into my memory. Let me just note two things about the film that seem to have escaped the attention of many viewers. The first is how much black, sardonic humor there is . Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle are genuinely AMUSING. The second is how romantic it is. I dont mean romantic in in the ""Harlequin romance"" sense, I mean ""romantic' in the Hawthorne/Melville sense. Like Ahab or Ethan Brand, Travis Bickle is a dark protagonist in a tale that  SEEMS realistic, but which is actually  surrealistic, fantastic, and just plain strange. Like them is he is on a dark, obsessive, demonic quest. After all, how much of what we see is really there, and how much  exists only in Travis' Fantasy world? in short, there is more here than meets the eye--much more. Perhaps David Lynch had a point when he said "" Kubrick is the coolest ( director),and Marty is next door."" An intelligent film critic could write a great essay on the bizarre spiritual -and stylistic-affinities between the surrealist/boy scout from Missoula and the gangster/priest from New York. They have more in common than Isabella Rossellini."

","Taxi Driver is one of my all time favorite films.  It is Scorsese's finest work.  Every element in the rising action of the film adds to an uneasy tension.  From the steaming sewers, to assorted people on the sidewalks, to Travis' bleak, disturbing narration, and each camera movement unseats the viewer giving you the same experience Travis is having.  Due to this feeling created by the film, you can really understand the Travis character.  He is the only film psycho, which I can really empathise with.  He is completely over the edge, and yet at the same time completely understandable.  Scorsese's brilliant directing, and DeNiro's amazing acting together create one of the most incredible film experiences I have ever had."

","I remember beeing a little disappointed after watching Taxi driver for the first time. What's so special about this movie, Travis Bickle just looks like another one of them psychopaths. I just couldn't understand what made this movie one off the best ever, even though De Niros acting was outstanding, possibly his best ever. (Maybe except from Raging bull and Awakenings)<br/><br/>Anyway, even though I thougt it was a very good movie altogether, I had problems understanding a few things. Like why did Travis bring Betty to a porn movie, he couldn't possibly be that stupid. Luckily i got the chance to see Paul schraeder make a few remarks about his script, and then,slowly, the whole thing started making sense. If you haven't seen this film, you should stop reading now.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is not stupid, he's just unaware of who he is, a victim to a self-imposed loneliness. He is his own enemy, but he doesn't realize it. The reason he brings Betty to a porn cinema, is that deep inside, probably unaware, he feels that he has to be alone, that's just the way it's supposed to be. He avoids all kinds of actual progress in his life, he has to continue doing things his own way. Another example is the part where he decides to improve his physique. He does 50 push-ups every day, but at the same time he eats all kind of unhealthy food, too make sure he doesn't really get anywhere.<br/><br/>Some people say the ending is unrealistic, that Travis Bickle would have gone to prison in real life, instead of becoming a hero. I think that he actually did go to prison, and that the ending we saw was just in his mind. And if I got it wrong, I have too say that I like the irony, even tough it can seam misplaced.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie is one of my all time favourites, is that it made me reconsider my life. I realized that I was much more like Travis than I dared too admit to myself, but now I had no choice. Therefore I honestly believe that this movie has gave me a better understanding of who I was, and what I had to do. In other words, it made me aware of my own feelings. Isn't that what art is all about?<br/><br/>Remember:You don't need eyes too see, you need VISION."

This is a movie dripping with talent.  It was marinated in talent and then wrapped up in a talent crepe.<br/><br/>Scorsese uses inventive camera angels and great color techniques.  He gives the actors an obvious motivation.  It's hard to explain great direction, but Scorsese was magnificent.<br/><br/>Before I praise Schrader's script, I'll say that a lot of the movie was ad-libbed.  In fact, the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" was totally improvised by DeNiro.  That being said, It's fantastic writing.  The very minute details that were written into the script, (I know this because I got the DVD special edition), make him fantastic.<br/><br/>This movie MADE Robert DeNiro for me.  I think almost anyone can testify to DeNiro's talent, but you ain't seen nothing till you've seen this movie. He's so subtle, but manages to be really powerful.  The viewer is torn among hating Travis, feeling really sorry for him, loving him, etc.  There's something about his eyes...there's no way of knowing what's going on behind them.  He's so multi-faceted.  (An overused phrase, I know, but it is relevant to this performance.)<br/><br/>Jodie Foster is a questionable choice for the role of Easy, but I guess she was the only person around, especially the only one whose mom would let her take it.

","(slight spoiler warning)<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is recognized by many as one of the greatest movies of all time. Film critics, ordinary people, any and everyone can relate to Travis Bickle through at least one experience. Travis Bickle is one of the greatest characters ever to be portrayed on screen, played by, of course, the greatest actor of all time. This movie is so brilliant I get the strong feeling that it's underrated. Grossly underrated. One of the greatest things about the movie is that its relevance has not diminished in the 26 years since its release. Travis Bickle is a pathetic, disturbed, psychotic, incredibly creepy guy. But we love him, and always will. Why? Because of his ambiguity. Is he a hero, or a sick mo-fo? Is his taxi his ""Batmobile"" in a way? Is his jacket that he's always wearing a ""cape""? One thing to notice is that he never finds out Betsy's last name, so there is no progress there, but later in the movie, the camera cuts to an envelope filled with money that he is going to give to Iris,with her last name on it, hinting that he will be more successful with her than he is with Betsy. Also, the scenes between Albert Brooks and Cybill Shepherd are there for a reason. Albert Brooks' character is likeable, affable, and you notice that he and Betsy mesh together well, they get along beautifully. This is, of course, the antithesis to Travis, who is completely out of touch with not just women, but everything in general. He takes Betsy to a porno movie and thinks there is NOTHING wrong with it. People like this actually exist, which is why Columbine happened. Why John Hinckley tried to kill Reagan to get Jodie Foster's attention. One user commented that no one that has commented on this site about this movie has ever said that they've actually enjoyed watching it. The movie was not made for entertainment purposes. It was made to teach people about the dangers of alienating people, and what an unbalanced mind can do with weaponry. This is arguably the greatest movie ever, I can only say arguably, because I'm extremely partial to ""The Godfather"", but there is no question in my mind that Robert De Niro is the greatest actor ever, and will be as immortal to movies as Travis Bickle. Bobby D has only been better in one film, of course, ""Raging Bull"", which is also arguably the greatest movie ever. It would be egregious of me to leave out Scorsese and his brilliant direction of this movie(not that bad of an actor, too, as evidenced by his scene in the cab). ""You talkin' to me?"" As one user said, this film is talking to to you. Also, one of the best scores ever on film by Bernard Herrmann. This film won no Oscars, (why do we even have them?), but Bobby won Best Actor from NY and LA Film Critics and a few other awards. You're kidding yourself if you think that ""Rocky"" is better than this movie. More inspirational, yes, but not superior. This was nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Jodie Foster(my wife), Best Actor for Bobby, and Best Original Score. But NO Best Director nod for Marty. NO BEST DIRECTOR NOD FOR MARTY!!!!! Are the Oscars bull****? If Martin Scorsese does not have one, you bet your ass."

DeNiro, Foster, Keitel, Boyle and Sheppard are all amazing in their roles. DeNiro is magnificent, but it is Keitel who truly ignites the screen with a role, that according to Keitel himself, was mostly improvised. He was originally set to play the Albert Brooks (also good) role, but Keitel wanted the pimp and that's what he got. To compare this Keitel with the Keitel in Mean Streets shows a great range on the part of the multi-talented actor.<br/><br/>The film is violent yes, but Scorsese almost makes it art. DeNiro's Travis Bickle is as twisted as the mean streets he meets every night, but he makes him someone we feel sympathy for. The scene with director Scorsese is quite amazing itself.

","""taxi driver"" is a masterpiece of film without flaws substantial enough to mention or even notice. the broken dreams of the sixties and the pervasive sense of doom and nihilism that ruthlessly pervade every scene of the movie reflects the artistic mentality of the early seventies and create an unmistakable atmosphere of dark surrealism aided by scorsese's incredible visuals that make new york city look like a hell of loneliness and debauchery without hope or redemption.  travis bickle, a taxi cab driver and young vietnam veteran, slowly slips into madness as the viewer watches and de niro's performance is so perfect that at times one must wonder if he felt some personal connection to the character or related to him in some profound way. it is not so much that travis is a 'loser' per se as a lucid but sick man who can no longer do what others do and ignore the horrendous depravity and inhuman indifference of his surroundings and the world as a whole. perhaps, in a strange way, he is the only truly 'sane' character in the entire movie, although this puts him in a tight spot indeed. the influence of dostoevsky's equally bleak ""notes from the underground"" is immediately apparent to readers of the book, and this entire film will strike a painful chord with those who have felt alienated and outcast at one time or another in their lives for whatever reasons. why, travis wonders, does no one care about him or what the world is coming to? how can scum like harvey keitel do atrocious things like prostitute twelve year old girls without anyone raising a finger in defense of the innocent? is there any sense or meaning in anything? and in defiance of conventional cinema, scorsese answers with a quite clear ""no"" to that question. there is not a glimmer of hope in this movie, simply a menacing ambiance of unrelenting sadness and hopelessness and that resounds in the viewer long after the film ends. although it temporarily satisfies travis, his act of vigilantism at the end of the film (the culmination of both his considerable personal neurosis and his legitimate perceptions of the evil and absurd nature of human society)really makes no difference and will only temporarily satiate travis' lust for vengeance on a world that has ejected him for recognizing the true state of things. a beautiful, unforgettable, haunting movie."

","Taxi Driver is probably the greatest put together film of all-time. I understand that for some people, like my mother who enjoys 40s films w/ Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Taxi Driver would be distasteful and unworthy of viewing. But beyond the violent scenes and disturbing dialogues (and certainly monologues) this film has wonderfully artful camera shots, angles and pans. Also, Bernard Herrmann's score, with equal parts tense and soothing melodies, is beautifully woven throughout the movie, usually over montages of street and taxi scenes during Travis' confessional periods at which point he laments the city and his own solitude and lack of direction. Paul Schrader's simple, yet emotionally complex screenplay, is followed very loyally by Scorsese. With great acting from Jodie Foster, Cybil Sheperd, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks and most certainly an amazing performance by Robert De Niro, Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films of all-time.  Overall, this film is beautifully constructed, directed and acted.  Truly a masterpiece."

","Martin Scorsese's fever dream about an reclusive Vietnam vet who drives the streets of New York in order to fuel his obsessive desire of ridding both the city and himself of demons has its startling moments (especially the graphically violent climax) and bravura performances from Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel; but it is also too loose in spots and some of the supporting actors are either blank (Cybill Shepherd) or wasted (Albert Brooks). Nevertheless, Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have zeroed in precisely on the urban angst that infects many and causes some to evolve their moral and religious beliefs into perceived righteous vengeance; the filmmakers create a climate of fear both seductively palpable and dangerous. Even though some of the politics might seem dated, the primeval impulses will always be relevant and these impulses follow Scorsese onward, from `The King Of Comedy' to `After Hours' all the way through to `Bringing Out The Dead'. A very bold--if flawed--piece of cinematic art. The clever, jarring jazz score is the last by the great Bernard Herrmann."

","Well - when I watched this film for the first time, it was on video. I couldn't get it out of my head and watched it five nights in a row. The very same movie. This movie. I have seen movies five times before - but not five nights in a row. Never ever. Not even close. And I have seen my share of movies.<br/><br/>This happened some years ago, and since then I have watched Taxi Driver quite often. Martin Scorsese became my favorite director with movies like Goodfellas, Casino and many more.<br/><br/>Goodfellas and Casino are great stories. I wouldn't say that Taxi Driver is.<br/><br/>
!!!Possible spoilers ahead!!!<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is raw. It is told in dark pictures with one character in the center. Every other character in the movie are just passing by this character. Robert De Niro is Travis Brickle - and he's perhaps the most masculine man portraited in a movie ever. And not in a very nice way. And definetly in a grotesk version. Travis is single minded. He doesn't care how he lives. He makes money because he don't know what else to spend his time with. He don't know how to use them, but kills time watching porn movies. When he sees a woman he likes, he follows her, observe her, and suddenly he attack. He has no idea of how woman thinks or what they want. Later he finds a mission. Wanting to save a woman (or more a girl), but she doesn't want to be saved. He wants to bring the world back in order, after it has been misbalanced. The reason in the film is the Vietnam War, but it could have been so much else. It is impossible to make this film with a woman in the main role. It is a male universe falling down. Like in ""Falling down"" with Michael Douglas. Travis is just breaking down slow and inside himself. His surroundings doesn't understand it. They doesn't even see it coming.<br/><br/>
I think most men one time or the other has behaved like Travis does in part of the movie. Perhaps we haven't shot a couple of guys trying to protect a young prostituted girl, or shaved our head and thought seriously about killing the president. Hopefully we haven't. But I think most in periods have felt somehow the same isolation. Felt that you were the only one in the world where the rest of it just rotated around you with all it's filth, and you just wished to do a difference. Not by killing anyone! But perhaps just save one. Like Nicolas Cage tries to in Scorseses newest movie: ""Bringing out the dead"" (there in many ways are very related to Taxi Driver, but doesn't catches the audience the same way).<br/><br/>Oh, I could go on and on with this movie, but just do yourself a favour and see it. It is not just a movie. It's a feeling. An expression. See it on a rainy night. Find a cinema that shows it on a rerun (and it only makes the experience better if you have to drive long to get to the cinema). See it with your soulmate or see it alone. But don't say a word while you see it. As long as this movie is on, you are in Travis' world. And it is dark and not very cheerful. But it's touching. As a painting. It's a piece of art - and it is the greatest movie ever made!"

","This movie, like many of its critics say, is a complete downer with almost nothing positive to show about life.  It just goes to show how a neurotic loser of a man can violently try to do something with his life, and fail at it. But anyone who's ever felt anxious, lonely and stressed out at any time can likely identify with him.  He's a common person's anxieties, only exaggerated to the extreme, I guess.  I was scared of Travis, only when he tries to save Iris from her pimp, when he wishes that the rain could wash away all the ""scum of the earth"", and when, in the last scene, he sees his reflection in the mirror and quickly hits the mirror away, I couldn't help but feel for him.  A lot of this movie's greatness comes from Bernard Herrmann's memorable music. Without it, the whole movie might have just been grim, but with the music, it's sad in an almost Romantic way.  In the end, I'd have to say it's a great movie, not because it puts you in any kind of positive mood, it's great because being in the world of Travis is an intense experience like almost no other movie is."

He can't sleep, and everything seems to bother him, especially Newyork City's dark, hell on earth atmosphere which is actually the way it was back in those days. I almost felt as if i related to DeNiro's character personally in this film. I myself sometimes get so fed up with politics and drug dealers and pimps abusing young prostitutes, the crime, etc. Newyork is always exaggerated as a hopeless hell on earth in Scorsese films, but it is a very stressful place to live in and It could be depressing at times. (but i love it here too much, and will never leave) but besides that, this movie so great, DeNiro was only better in one film (the Raging Bull) in my opinion he was at his best in that movie, the way Pacino was in Scarface and the Godfather.

"alice267","Null","0","0","10 December 2001"," A film that makes you consider some questions
","From the title of the film ¨ Taxi Driver¨, it seems the director attempted to let the audience picture their own image about a taxi driver by themselves first. Generally, taxi drivers give the public such an impression: a group in a bit lower level in society, not so knowledgeable or well-educated and perhaps interested in politics, women or gambling, just common people leading an ordinary life. As the scenario unfolded, what the director thought about taxi drivers was gradually presented. Yet, in the case of ""Taxi Driver"", other issues drew the viewers attention as well. We can ask some questions and find the possible answers to them. What was the leading character's response to reality after his discharge from Marine Corps? Did he get lost and fail to adapt to circumstances? How did he view and position himself? How did a work class like him interact with others around him or from other classes?<br/><br/> The film was presented in a narrating way and the leading character was the storyteller. This could not only shorten the distance between the movie itself and the audience but also involve the audience into the movie as if they were characters, not just a relevant third party. This transformed the audience from being passive receivers to active participants. Once viewers presume themselves to be members of a story while seeing a movie, they are more attentive to its development and try to conceive the plot at the position of the movie characters. We can say this kind of approach is liable to find an echo among the audience.<br/><br/> Besides, the music in this film had a smack of weirdness or a sense of uneasiness. As a matter of a fact, the music throughout the movie was uncomfortable; this was made to match the progress of the film. In particular, it was worse in the scenes when the taxi driver drove on the road and narrated. The unpleasant music spotlighted the solitude of the leading character and exposed his inner world---helpless, depressed, anxious, and also perplexed. Via the vivid performance of Robert De Niro, the leading characters affection was interpreted successfully. His cold facial expression in the cab, his tough eye contact against the male pimp and his provoking attitude toward the bodyguard grabbed the viewers attention and captured the hearts of the audience.<br/><br/> Furthermore, a trivial point showed the prudence of the director. When the taxi driver was on duty, he wore a working jacket. However, when he dated the pretty woman he appreciated, he was dressed in a suit to match the image and the higher status of that girl. This illustrated the leading characters self-perception and the disparity of social levels between him and that girl. Higher-classed and well educated vs. lower-classed and poorly educated. This implied the conflicts or distinctions existing in upper and lower classes. Basically, it was difficult to bridge the big gap between the two distinctive worlds. Thus, it was not hard to understand why the taxi driver didn't know how to deal with the girl for the first date and caused a failure by taking her to see a porn movie.<br/><br/> In addition, the director was quite sarcastic about the hypocrisy of politicians. Two scenes were arranged to oppose each other. One was the senator candidate in the drivers cab with a cold attitude; the other one was the candidate delivering a speech with enthusiasm and raising the slogan ¨We Are The People¡¨. Maybe the director attacked politicians by using this extreme contrast.<br/><br/> As for the change of the taxi driver by resuming physical training and having a new hairstyle, the director here would like to bring up the subject of the post traumatic stress syndrome. ""Taxi Driver"" was released shortly after the end of the Vietnam War, which was a nightmare for the US. The leading character, a retired marine, found himself unable to fit in society, failing to sleep or lead a normal life. That happened to lots of vets then. The description reflected this phenomenon and raised a question about how to overcome this problem. Due to the frustration about real life, the taxi driver withdrew and returned to his delusion, imagining he was still operating a special mission in order to evade reality. This movie didn't simply sell 'violence' when the driver resorted to masculine heroic behavior; it pinpointed a more important thing---when heroes lose their battlefield, how to settle them and what should be done to help them shape their mind-set again and got a balance between the roles of a tough hero and a common person. Perhaps this was what the director wanted to discuss and invited the audience to give a thought as well."
"AdFin","10","0","0","6 December 2001"," `How long have I been driftin' alone through the night' - the defining scene of this film
","One scene above any other defines what Taxi Driver (1976) is all about, many of the scenes of the film have been talked about and mulled over in order to understand just why the film is as important and powerful today as it was when it first hit the screens back in the mid seventies, but no other scene taps directly into the pain and emotion the character is going through. The scene in question in the scene in which deranged cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) sits in his filthy apartment, shirt undone, magnum in hand, captivated by an episode of ""American Bandstand"", the barrel of his gun aimed at the young, predominantly black dancers. The obsession and the pain on his face, not out of blind racism as others have commented, but out of jealousy, the fact that the young couples are together and happy. Travis watches the scene alone, his attempt at a relationship with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) pretty much none existent, his loneliness becoming uncontrollable. This scene takes place (if I remember correctly) shortly after the scene in which Travis shoots the robber at the convenience store, his anger and mixed up sense of redemption are seemed to be momentarily healed by the violence, the sense of purpose the almost vigilante assault instated upon him. This is a turning point in the character's life, the calm before the storm if you will, and the music makes this message all the more clear. The words of Jackson Browne in his song ""Late for the Sky"" (""How long have I been drifting alone through the night""), of course Travis is going through as stage of self reflection, the song continues - ""Awake again I can't pretend/And I no I'm alone/And close to the end""... Travis is at his end, he can't take any more of the insomnia and the self-hatred that will all be released in the cathartic blood bath at the final, this is the scene in which Travis finally makes up his mind to go ahead with the ""bad ideas"" that are rolling around in his head. This is the reason Taxi Driver looses none of it's power after nearly thirty years, the character of Bickle has something everyone can identify with, who hasn't felt more alone in the biggest city imaginable, Travis isn't mad, he's just been pushed too far by his feelings, his want to be ""someone"" more than the average Joe on the street. Plus the structure of the film works fantastically with Paul Schrader's writing, the continuity changes in Travis' hair style means we have no idea just how long a time period the film takes up, Scorsese's use of repetitious imagery as Travis cruises the streets in the yellow cab, bring home the mundane-ness of the job, his street level photography and composition, as both writer and director trick us into following this at first eccentric and charming character, into one of the most furious blood stained finals ever committed to film. Taxi Driver is till the best representation of loneliness and urban alienation we have ever seen, and in these less than cynical times, may ever see again. 10/10"
"sean_36","10","0","0","30 November 2001"," The Best Film Ever Made
","I have yet to see a film that surpasses Taxi Driver.  Martin Scorsese's brilliant masterpiece is not just a great film but a riveting character study.  The story of an obsessed loner who takes it upon himself to rid the streets of New York from the scum that infests it is even more poignant now then ever.  The thing that makes Taxi Driver so unique is that despite his homicidal intentions the character of Travis Bickle still remains likable and can even be viewed as a hero of sorts.  The audience identifies with his struggle to clean up the streets and save a teenage prostitute from a life of drugs and degradation. Of course whether Bickle is a hero or not can still be debated, but what remains certain is that Taxi Driver is surely a film for the ages."

"exterminator_99","10","0","0","28 October 2001"," Essential study in urban paranoia
","""Taxi Driver"" remains for me the best piece of work by Martin Scorsese. Stripped of the pretense of ""Raging Bull"" and the stylized atmosphere of ""GoodFellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" is a unashamedly honest look at New York city and its effects on a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran.  Often uneasy to watch but amazingly and utterly compelling, ""Taxi Driver"" launched Martin Scorsese into the pantheon of great directors.<br/><br/>Set in modern day (1976) New York, the story centres around Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a 26 year-old ex Vietnam veteran.  He is shy, dispossesed and utterly alone.  He frequents porn theatres, yet is repulsed by the 'filth' he sees on the streets.  Unable to sleep at night, Travis becomes a taxi driver, working long shifts with little or no sleep.<br/><br/>Through his nightly experiences as a cab driver, Travis becomes even more bitter and confused.  Bernard Herrmann's impecible theme aurates Travis' battle between what he thinks he should stand against and what actually arouses him.  In fact, the theme music is perhaps the second most important character in the film, acting as a metaphor for the daily downward spiral of Travis' mental state.<br/><br/>In his solitude Travis lets the drudgery and depressive nature of his job burrow inside his mind.  He falls for an angelic WASP named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and even manages to take her out on a date.  But his complete lack of nuance for the real world ends up with any chance of a burgeoning romance left in tatters.<br/><br/>What makes Travis' journey into madness even more compelling is the portrayl of the character by Robert De Niro.  As the film progresses, De Niro's fractured performance is so real, you almost feel he really is Travis Bickle, even now some 25 years since the film's release.  De Niro's best scenes are when he is trying to interact with 'normal' people, like his cab driver friends, or his confrontations with Tom (Albert Brooks) - a co-worker of Betsy.  The way De Niro is one step removed from these and all the other characters in the movie is a feat he has not matched since.<br/><br/>The script by Paul Schrader is also superb.  The film shifts from centering on Travis' insecurity, to his misguidance and eventually to his role as a psychotic vigilante.  The dialogue is superb and each character is shaped perfectly.<br/><br/>The film also makes use of its many smaller, but no less important roles, such as Sport the Pimp (Harvey Keitel), Wizard the cabbie (Peter Boyle), Tom and Iris (Jodie Foster).  All of these characters display an on screen presence that is rarely matched by other supporting cast members.<br/><br/>
Holding it altogether is Scorsese.  New York has never looked sleazier or grimier.  ""Taxi Driver"" works because Scorsese never lets the film slip in any way.  Movie buffs will recognise many small homages to different directors, but even the casual viewer will feel nailed to their seat as the walls within Travis' mind creep further and further in.<br/><br/>A true feat of modern film making and a study in paranoia that may never be bettered, ""Taxi Driver"" is an important chapter in American film and one that requires repeat viewings despite its difficult and uneasy vibe.  A modern classic without question."

","I first saw Taxi Driver on video a few years ago, and I remember my Drama teacher telling me that it's one of those films that'll change your perspective. Well, I don't think that it turned my world around, but it certainly messed with it. Seeing Robert DeNiro as this lonely and pathetic nightwatcher may be slow paced for some, but it's watching him turn into a demented vigilante that makes it most interesting. It's like watching what goes through every lonely man's mind at some point in his life, but then watching DeNiro carry out these repressed animosities is the part that hit my nerves. Never before has any other film charged my psyche so much. And Scorcese's work on the film really added to that sense of building up so much rage for society. Oh, and just watching DeNiro doing the ""You talking to me?"" scene really sums the feeling up nicely. I highly recommend this film, it'll mess with your head, but in an entertaining way so don't worry."

","This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen.<br/><br/>It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-five years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role.<br/><br/>He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.<br/><br/>Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"jonathandoe_se7en","9","0","0","1 September 2001"," ""The days go on and on, they don't end"".
","SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>So are the words of misfit taxi driver Travis Bickle (De Niro), a man who ""would not take it anymore"". De Niro presence carries this film, from the shots of him driving his cab around hellish 70's New York, right through until the end (ironically, still driving his cab around the hellish 70's New York). Taxi Driver works on a loop, as we follow Bickle deeper into his plan to ""wipe the scum of the streets"".<br/><br/>The film does however; contain some serious flaws, which in an odd way only help to highlight the power of the film. Firstly, too much is left up to audience work out, and for a character like Travis, we need to know the full story if we are to ultimately root for him, how are we to feel sympathy for his anguish when we don't know the cause of it, most viewers speculate it comes from his days in the army, his tour in Vietnam, other like to think that the disease of the city has finally consumed him. I would like to pose another character variation; to me Travis is nothing more than hateful man. He's a man who isn't consumed by the city but reflects it, he takes in the paranoia, the selfishness, the impotence, he talks himself into thinking that what he is doing is right, that because Betsy (Cybil Sheapard) refuses his advances it's justification for him to assassinate Palentine.<br/><br/>The morality of the character is a screwed up as the hookers he watches as he passes by in the solitary of his cab, moving through the streets `like a ghost'. There is also a strong racist feeling to the film, from the way Travis looks at the pimps who are hanging out the coffee shop, to his complete lack of hesitation when he blows away the corner store bandit. It's only towards the end of the film that any of this starts to work, we get what Schrader and Scorsese were trying to say with this film, from the moment Travis steps out of his cab and approaches Sport (Harvey Kietel) for the second time, we realise what we are witnessing. Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro have lured us into a massacre, a blood bath... Bringing into play our own sense of morality, hopefully making us feel changed, this is why Taxi Driver is a classic. <br/><br/>The film say's so much about man, the masochistic rage that Travis displays whilst confronted by the wimpy Tom (Albert Brooks), but at the same time he's sickened by the enthusiastic babble of his ""creepy fair"" (Scorsese, ""You ever seen what a 44 can do to a woman's P***y?""). Travis' own messes up morality makes him a hero; his own selfish acts have proven to appear selfless, stripping away the façade of the film hero. Of course Taxi Driver was criminally robed of Oscars by the flag waving patriotism of Rocky, just going to show how close to the bone Taxi Drivers portrait of America was. <br/><br/>

","Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely rivetting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece."

","What else can I say other than how unbelievable Robert Deniro's performance was! His acting in this film clearly ranks among the best performance's in cinematic history. An actor did not do a good job if you can not feel for or relate to the character in any way. Because in reality if you can't, your not going to care for the person performing the roll, nor the film. I had just recently bought this film, after watching it over a friend's house. I was astounded by this film's message's and realism. This film clearly show's how dirty and sick this world at times really is. Martin Scorsese picked the right idea on a man whom was in this mess, was actually a decent human being. The only thing that turned this man mad, was in turn the world. The world as to which he fought for in Vietnam, yet no one respected or cared for him in any way. I like how they incorporated Travis Bickle's sanity and insanity at the same time. At time's I was a little confused if he was sane or insane, which was great. Only because this gave you the chance to deside for yourself, if Travis was either trying to make good with his sanity, or just rampaging while killing people with his insanity. I (like many others), think that he was sane. He was perfectly sane. The only times I felt he was insane was when he did not care for his health or his own decency. When he started to care (the supposed insane stage), he took care of himself, and treated himself with respect. I feel though, at both times, he was still a little sane. Basically because this man was willing to sit down and write about his day, which is a great thing to do if you deal with ""scumbags"" all day. That I feel, helped him keep his sanity.<br/><br/>I think though, that the thing that made him this angry, was when he realized and saw what he had fought and killed for in Vietnam. Many think that the war made him crazy, I don't. I think that the people (the pimps, prostitutes, perverts, murderers, scumbags...etc...all of it), drove him mentally unstable.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster played probably her best roll as Iris as did Cybill Shepherd as Betsy. I think everyone that was in this film though did an outstanding job.<br/><br/>

"eibon09","10","0","0","2 July 2001"," Fantastic Study Of a Man Losing His Grip on Reality
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Travis Bickle is an icon of the 1970s in the same way that Norman Bates is an icon of the 1960s.  He is a fascinating and scary character.  Travis Bickle is perfectly played by Robert De Niro.  De Niro's role as Travis Bickle is a role that should be put up there with the likes of Peter Lorre's Hans{M}, Anthony Perkins Norman Bates{Psycho}, Carl Boehm's Karl Lewis{Peeping Tom}, and Michael Rooker's Henry Lee Lucus{Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer}.  By the end Travis Bickle is closer to the point of being someone like Henry Lee Lucus from Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer.<br/><br/>
The Wrong Man(1958) is one of the main influences on Taxi Driver(1976). Especially true in the POV shots of Travis Bickle.  Also, like in Alfred Hitchcock's film, the camera follows the eyes of Bickle in a tight close up shot.  Has the same feeling of Paranoia that plagues the main character of The Wrong Man(1958).  An example of this is the moment when Henry Fonda is placed between two Policemen in the back of a small car.<br/><br/>
The theme of alienation plays an important role in the personal world of the narrator.  The other Scorsese film where alienation is an essential part of the film is the underrated Last Temptation of Chirst(1988).  Alienation affects many of the male characters in the director's movies. The more alienated Bickle becomes the more deranged he acts.  One of the realistic portrait of alienation and loneliness on celluloid.<br/><br/>
The direction is great because Martin Scorsese films many scenes which are memorable and powerful.  What makes the direction great is the way the movie goes from scene to scene without any major problems.  I know that a master is a work with the sheer brilliance of the important sequences.  He brings out the best in actors like Cybill Shepherd.  Its the closet thing to a horror picture Martin Scorsese has ever done.<br/><br/>
Excellent in showing that the line between hero and assassin is extremely blurry.  Ironic that Travis Bickle is branded a hero for killing a pimp after being a trigger away from assassinating a politican. Shows the difference between being a hero or murderer is based on who Society sees as acceptable or not acceptable.  Travis Bickle is seen as a hero because he's in a time period where people crave for heros.  In this regard Travis Bickle is similar in some ways to Pechorin of Mikhail Lermontov's novella, A HERO OF OUR TIME.<br/><br/>
One of the most recognizable lines and scenes belongs to Taxi Driver(1976) in the memorable mirror scene.  The most famous of all De Niro's acting moments.  Takes an eerie look in the dual mind of Travis Bickle.  Tour de force job for an actor who gives many great performances like this in almost every film he has appeared in.  Lots of improv was done by De Niro because he does not act the same way twice.<br/><br/>
The meeting with Betsy and Iris in a coffee shop are an interesting contrast.  First, Travis is compelled by what Betsy has to say and repelled by the things Iris says.  Second, Betsy is seen as conservative while Iris is looked up as rebellious.  Third, Betsy and Iris have different ideas on the meaning of life.  The only thing the two meetings in a coffee shop have in common are they both follow up in disaster.<br/><br/>
One scene which impressed is when the camera moves away from Travis talking on the phone with Betsy and stands still into an empty hallway. Illiustrates that its too painful for the camera to watch Travis being rejected by Betsy. More painful for the camera to see than the carnage in the hallway of the Pimp's place during the climatic scene.  Symbolic of the emptiness and shame felt by Travis Bickle during this one moment. Makes the viewer for a moment sympathize with Travis Bicke.<br/><br/>
The shootout in the climatic scene is very bloody and gory.  The desaturation of the color of blood is the only reason Taxi Driver(1976) wasn't given an X rating.  What disturbs many is not the violent content when first previewed but the high emotional intensity of the color red. The make up effects are effective and filled with a little stark realism.  As intense in colors as the murder scenes from Mario Bava's classic giallo, Blood & Black Lace(1964).<br/><br/>
The final scene feels like a dream in progress.  Some terrific acting is given by the supporting cast including Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keital.  Taxi Driver(1976) is an modern take of the masterful John Ford western, The Searchers(1956).  Fantasticly written by Independant writer and director, Paul Schrader.  Martin Scorsese feature that definitely is influenced by the horror pictures Mario Bava did in color during the mid 1960s to early 1970s."

He can't sleep and figures he might as well make some money out of his insomnia.  He becomes fixated on Cybill Shepard who then rejects him - on their first date he takes her to the movies but it happens to be a dirty movie.  This always seemed like a very poignant moment for me - to him, that was what couples did, they went to the movies on a date.  He was not able to differentiate between that movie and a regular movie, it wasn't that he was coming on to her or anything.  And it wasn't that he was completely ignorant either.<br/><br/>He becomes increasingly frustrated and is egged on by an encounter with a psycho passenger (played by Scorsese) who discusses in detail what he plans to do to his wife, who he can see is cheating on him from the back of Travis' cab.  This scene is a riot and you might hate yourself for laughing, but Scorsese obviously is enjoying himself.  I don't think DeNiro says a word in their scene together.  He also fancies himself as Saviour - he tries to appeal to a young hooker (Jodie Foster) to go back home and live a normal life.  She seems stuck in her world until all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>This movie has become a classic over the years, mostly because of DeNiro's towering performance.

I was also surprised to see Scorsese with a cameo in the movie as a jealous husband. And believe me, this movie has one of the bloodiest endings I have ever seen. Rent this one for the love of God!"

De Niro, Scorsese, writer Paul Schrader, composer Bernard Herrmann, and cinematographer Michael Chapman pool their collective talents, and the end result is one of cinema's most realistic dramas.

"irajoel","10","0","0","6 April 2001"," Mean Lean Scorsese
","Hot summer nights in New York City,rain soaked black patent leather streets shine and glisten as a lone, looney & lonely taxi cab driver stalks the streets in his bright yellow cab. This is Martin Scorsese's taxi driver played by Robert DeNiro, at the height of his powers as an actor. He's so young, taunt & handsome & totally out of it, in a totally out of it city. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle (great name) who we see in a series of memorable scenes is a time bomb ticking away, ready to blow up in society's face. And even though we know the big bang is coming, we are still shocked, surprised & disturbed by the bloody ending. This was Scorsese's second big time Hollywood feature, done after his light but very likeable ""woman's picture"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" which won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar. This is a young director's movie, exciting,dangerous & full of great images & scenes, that exhibit a willingness to take chances which mostly pay off big time. It's also a scary movie, an urban horror show for real. The city of night in this movie is both beautiful with neon colors reflecting on wet streets, and ugly in its deprevation and decay. The film is ""religious"" & spiritual taking us along for the anti-hero's long dark journey through hell, both internal & external and his violent and bloody redemption. This Scorsese landscape is littered with human garbage: child whores & pimps, criminals & politicians, crazies who want to do terrible things, politicians who want to get elected. This is a beautifully made and crafted film, full of memorable lines & images. Gliding taxis with steam rising from the streets, Bernard Herrmann's last great score, jazzy and mournful rides along for the trip. Notable performances by little miss Foster, before she became the Oscar winning movie star, rigid & uptight. She's so good eating her toast & jam, trying to sex up Deniro, slow dancing with Harvey the greasy pimp, that we almost think she's the real McCoy, a miniature Mary waiting to be saved. Also good are the already mentioned Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks as the campaign worker luckless in love with blonde venus Cybill Shepherd (also never better) & the director himself as the taxi passenger from hell,who wants to do terrible things to his cheating wife's private parts. This guy is so bad & creepy that even Travis is frighten. Also of note is Michael Chapman's candy colored cinematography & the gorgous Diahnne Abbott (married at the time to DeNiro)in a bit part as the porn theatre cashier. Although I'm not crazy about the epilogue ending,(was this used to make us feel better?) this is still one of the great films, if not the greatest film of the 70's, and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. Hard to believe that he did not receive a best director Oscar nomination, and that the film itself lost out for best picture to the simple and sentimental Rocky. Well actually maybe I shouldn't be surprised."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","2 April 2001"," Excellent film by Martin Scorsese that foreshadows the great Bringing Out The Dead, which he directed on almost the same subject over two decades later.
","Taxi Driver deals with the perils of big city life, and the film works so well because it adds a touch of mental instability to this otherwise tired theme.  It focuses on the life of a lower middle class man who lives in a city that he finds filthy and that is full of people who disgust him. Everyone has impulses to do things that they know they would never actually do, and the vast majority of people generally listen to the voice of reason. Taxi Driver deals with what happens when a man acts on those impulses, driven away from reason by the multitude of atrocities that surround him.<br/><br/>
Travis Bickle seemed to be a person who had a very lonely life. The film begins with him applying for a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep at night, and this may be a symptom of his loneliness. He likes to spend his free time at the adult movie theater, and he even took a date there, which tends to give the impression that he is not very experienced with women. Like most introverted people, he kind of kept to himself a lot of the time, and almost always seemed to be fairly deep in thought about something. As he took in everything around him, he constantly saw terrible things (bums, drug dealers, twelve-year-old prostitutes, etc) that drove him closer and closer to the proverbial edge.' His inability to establish healthy relationships is more than likely a result of bad experiences during childhood, which also gave him this mistrustful and overall negative perception of the world. His rescue attempt, although seemingly insignificant in such a huge city full of crime and corruption, was his personal endeavor to try to make a difference, to do something important and good which would give a specific purpose to his otherwise meaningless life. <br/><br/>Travis Bickle seemed to gradually begin to realize his own dire intentions and at one point even seeks advice from one of his fellow cab drivers. He goes to an experienced cab driver known as the `Wizard,' and basically asks him for direction in life, but walks away without having received any comprehensive advice. It seems that he felt that there was something positive in the world that he was missing and that was why he had such negative feelings about it. When he found that the Wizard' evidently either had no idea what he was talking about or had a very hard time explaining himself, he seemed to be discouraged. The fact that he was not reassured at all by this guidance troubled him, and it seemed to narrow his options. It made him feel that the world really did exist exactly as he saw it, and he began to feel even more strongly that something had to be done about it.<br/><br/>
Taxi Driver is a very dark film. There is a lot of narrative by Bickle, a lot of it as he writes letters, which he may or may not even have anyone to send to. Even more important that that is when he would be driving in his taxi and his thoughts would be narrated out loud for the audience. Often during these narrations the viewer would see the streets as Bickle saw them, very dark, cold, dirty, and filled with questionable and suspicious looking people. Coupled with his unhappy words, this darkness gave the city an entirely dismal look. <br/><br/>One of the things that this film is most famous for is Bickle's mohawk. It is such a drastic change that it calls attention to his psychotic condition. The first time his mohawk is shown is while he is at one of senator Palantine's rallies. Bickle is smiling radiantly and capping enthusiastically, but he also has this crude and extreme haircut, and he is wearing an army-green trench coat through which the viewer can clearly see the bulges of the guns that he recently purchased. You know he's not there to cheer on his favorite candidate. This plan to assassinate Palantine, like his conversation with the Wizard, and his relationship with Betsy, was another failure, and this was part of the reason that he put so much more effort into being successful in helping Iris. <br/><br/>The countless point of view shots from the taxi window looking at prostitutes, pushers, pimps, thieves, and all sorts of other sleazy people that allowed the viewer to relate to Bickle's view of the world. Robert DeNiro provided a spectacular performance as the mentally disturbed Travis Bickle, and the brilliant direction by Martin Scorsese also served to mold Taxi Driver into the timeless classic that it has become. It's not a pretty film in any way, but the skill and the style are unmistakable."

","Decades of mimicking by countless himbo actors and De Nero wannabes have done little to erode the famous mirror scene's impact, and the fact that this has to be one of the saddest lines in modern cinema history. Sad because NOBODY'S talkin' to him. Travis is all alone in his room.<br/><br/>Not much more can be said about this American masterpiece that hasn't been said before. But there is one bone I'd like to pick. It's the Vietnam Vet issue. Most people seem to accept it at face value. But we are never really sure that Travis ever served in the military, let alone Vietnam. It's doubtful that a semi-literate simpleton would have passed the endless series of mental, psychological tests needed for entrance into military service. It's highly likely that Mr. Bickle's rejection from society began at his home-town's recruiting office, long before his fatefull move to New york.<br/><br/>
Many Vietnam vets single this film out for (unintentionally?) creating the negative image of the crazed veteran, still accepted by the American public to this day. Still, this film is a shining example of what the American Cinema was capable of doing once upon a time..."

","All in all, this is a tremendous film.  One of the most uncomprimising and personal films I'd ever seen.  So many films insist on create characters that we like or can ""relate"" to.<br/><br/>Scorsese often opts not to force us to like a character, but to understand him.  One things for sure, we grow to understand Travis, love or hate his actions.<br/><br/>I have just one problem with this film.  I think the film comes so close to perfection one can overlook a few little faults (The piece of Errol Flynn's bathtub dosen't make much sense, and even though Travis is supposed to be detached, would he really be stupid enough to take Betsy to a porno movie?).  Still, I wish they had ended the movie with the blood bath.  The films epilogue, I feel, prevents the film to reaching the highest of hights it comes so close to reaching.<br/><br/>For one thing, if a man shot three people, however degenerate they may be, he probably wouldn't be allowed to walk the streets, and he definitely would not be allowed to drive a cab.  The scene also ruins much of the intimacy of the film.  One of the beautiful things about movies is that we are given insight into a character that the other characters in the film aren't given.  We know why Travis did what he did.  This whole comment on the media portraying him as a hero just ruins the special quality of the film. There was no need to vindicate Travis, we already assessed our opinions of him.  There was no need to moralize.  Thankfully, Scorsesee would become less prone to moralize with ""Raging Bull"", ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Goodfellas""."

","One of the greatest works of modern fiction is Martin Scorsese's film `Taxi Driver'. The film is less a realistic drama than a nightmare of the unconscious. The events depicted in the film could not, for all intents and purposes, take place in our modern world of repression and cynicism. By taking us out of that world Scorsese can tell a cautionary tale of the human mind, and its limits. <br/><br/> The reason I respect this film and its director so much is the exquisite development of the Bickle character. This man represents every man in his loneliness and potential for violence. It must be remembered in analyzing his character that the story is not in any sense real, it is a nightmare. By constantly reinforcing the dreamlike nature of the story, the director makes it seem that we are floating in Bickle's mind, and everything we see we realize is not the way it really is, but the way he sees it. When we look at the movie from this perspective, we can see that the Bickle character is very much like us. He is frightened by what he does not understand. He is alienated by a seemingly cold society that rejects his attempts at intimacy. Perhaps we have all not been alienated in this way, but surely all of us have felt alone and sometimes afraid. <br/><br/> This film is a brutally honest portrait of the creature called man, in all his glory and shame. The climax of the movie has Bickle going on a violent rampage, acting out his dark thoughts and deeds. Since this is a nightmare, not reality, this rampage represents the impulse in all of us for an outlet to our dark thoughts of violence and revenge. After his shooting spree, Bickle is seen as a hero, if only in his own mind. This redemption of Bickle's soul suggests that there is a possibility of redemption for all of us. It also reflects the director's strongly Catholic upbringing.<br/><br/>
 Taxi Driver is a cautionary tale, a film awakening in us a recognization of our own inner fears and desires, and our darker capabilities. The film expresses deeply felt emotions quietly, compassionately with Bickle, and we identify with him. Because they appeal to our own sense of moral responsibility, Bickle's fears of himself and the outside world work to gain compassion from the audience at large. Though we all perhaps have not been as convicted as Travis, nor lived our nightmares, one must at the least acknowledge and in some ways respect Bickle's lone honesty as he grapples for a sense of someplace to go, all he ever wanted - a sense of belonging. Travis's bloody rampage is the last climactic psychological attempt to express his rage toward the filth of society for a man who has been failed by all other forms of expression in society, and by society - attempts at simple conversation, to focus not on the macabre but the wholesome, or to make a true friend. In the end we see a man, disgusted by the utter trash around him, the garbage, the degradation of life, and through this unhealthy realization has he lost the appreciation of life he once had. He wishes to do one good thing for society - to make his contribution, which just happens to be the ridding of others whose lifestyles he loathes.<br/><br/>
 When Travis's mind has crossed the Rubicon, we see there was never any other way for him but force - true force. Thus the whole film has led us to the doorstep of a few final scenes, which are really the film's primary subject as much as Bickle is. It is the concern with morality, the respect for life and the heightened awareness of morality's absence by solitude that lead us to a bloodbath that seems to be a paradoxical argument for life, told through a violent crime. And so we see a man who could not take it anymore. We see a man who stood up. With some irony we can take it, if the ending can be accepted as real (and it's not a given that it can be), the very society which Travis hated becomes his saviour in the aftermath of his coup de grâce. Knowing that he has at last accomplished something in his mind worthwhile and honourable, Bickle is at peace with himself, and what under normal conditions society might have interpreted as heinous is deemed heroic."

The lead actor Mr. De Niro is really a pathetic person and the whole performance of Mr. De Niro is laughable and Mr.De Niro his performance seems like if he is reading the lines out of a bad juvenile novel. The one aspect of this film work that can be consider a more than average is the visual style that is covering the bad acting bad lines in this film work where murder is praised and that is the subject of a movie work, where the original screenplay was killing members of an ethnic minority group in the United States of America, and where murder is hailed. Ms Foster is playing a child prostitute which I personally wouldn't advice anyone who have young individuals living at home to see this film work, because this film work must be consider as inappropriate for these individuals to watch, even though one might say that it is film work and not the reflection of reality. In that sense the film work ""TAXI DRIVER"" is not a reflecting of reality, but a reflecting of how in Hollywood the law is not consider as a serious option. Why did the main character didn't go to police to report the pimp played by Mr. Keitel for keeping a minor as prostitute ? This is the appropriate way to solve this. That the producers and the director, who also is hailing e.g. the use of a gun in a scene where a client(played by the director)is asking the main character if he realize what a magnum 54 can do if you put it in a woman, meaning his wife who is having sex with another man, her vagina.

But however cool the thought is, I'd rather watch a story that drags me into a world, rather than one where I can hardly focus on it.<br/><br/>On top of that the written plot describes a 'mentally unstable' person, and then he goes on getting his hands on a lot of guns, and you expect - or maybe I just hoped - that here was a smart way to introduce a morale to the story that encourages gun control in the U.S. But in the end Travis goes out, almost attempts to shoot a senator, runs away, and instead shoots a lot of ""gangsters"" and is proclaimed hero. A mentally unstable person, who has stalker tendencies, anger issues and a twisted sense of judgment end up being prised for a shooting massacre, and he didnt even have registered guns... Is that really a story worth telling?"

Yah he might be a crazy mentally disappeared guy, but he still should have the common sense to not take a girl to a porno film. That part just drove me crazy.

Just didn't make sense to me. There were some positives I like all the POV shots and for a color film. I thought they did a great job of lighting, and all though i didn't understand De Niro's character I though he did a great job of making a believable crazy person.

"CinemaClown","Null","2","5","30 September 2018"," Overhyped!
","Painting an interesting portrait of the underbelly of New York City with its lurid camerawork & deteriorating set pieces, Taxi Driver is a steady examination of an unsteady character whose arc unfolds like a ticking time bomb and leaves behind nothing but carnage & corpses when it finally detonates.<br/><br/>Set in New York City during the 1970s, the story of Taxi Driver follows a Vietnam War veteran who's on the verge of mental breakdown and takes the job of night-time cab driving to cope with his loneliness, depression & insomnia but a couple of setbacks trigger his descent into madness as he eventually snaps and gives in to his violent urges.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film is crafted like a drug-induced reverie and is carried by a character who himself is struggling to hang on to his sanity. The plot is rather simplistic, most people in the picture are messed up in the head, and the themes of loneliness, depression & mental illness are wonderfully addressed. But what exactly makes it worthy of such praise?<br/><br/>Is it the fever-dream atmosphere achieved by vibrant camerawork & neon lighting or is it Travis Bickle & what he stands for in the post-Vietnam War America or the downhill journey he undergoes or that iconic monologue that has become a pop culture mainstay ever since or that bloody violent finale? Maybe a combination of all mixed with cynical attitude of the 1970s? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>There isn't anything necessarily wrong with the story or how it is translated to the screen. The atmosphere is dark & alluring, Cinematography captures the ugly side of New York like never before and the use of colour palette & lighting is inspiring. Bernard Herrmann's score has a dreamlike quality to it that not only fits the film's tone but also uplifts it. And the themes it addresses aren't difficult to grasp either.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Taxi Driver puts Robert De Niro front & centre of the screen and the actor brings his disturbed character to cinematic life with panache. Supporting characters get only limited space to share with De Niro's Travis Bickle but Jodie Foster still manages to make her mark. Cybill Shepherd & Harvey Keitel play their roles well but it's De Niro who carries pretty much the entire film all by himself.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Taxi Driver is counted amongst the greatest films ever made and while I found it to be a fascinating insight into the deteriorating psyche of a troubled individual in addition to a splendid piece of filmmaking, I don't entirely concur with the masses when it comes to its legendary reputation. The film does what it set out to do but it is no game-changer. I rather found it overhyped to be honest. And if I'm the only one, then so be it."
"AterAlbus","8","2","5","16 December 2014"," Dark and gripping psychological drama with De Niro at top form
","""Taxi Driver"", one of Martin Scorsese's most widely known works, is a gripping and compelling portrait of a troubled character. This dark psychological drama is concerned in exploring the mind of his protagonist, linking the effects of living in the city with the development of his personality. <br/><br/>This character is Travis Buckle, played by Robert de Niro, the titular taxi driver and a lonely man who has get the job as a way of battling against his insomnia. Travis spends all nights driving passengers of all kind through the city, although he doesn't care about that, he spends all the journey looking outside the window, looking at the 'animals' of the city, corrupt and dirty people without values.<br/><br/>As much as Travis tries he is not very good interacting with others. He detest most people but he has some friends, though he doesn't talk with them too much and when he tries to express something he feels uncomfortable. He is not very good with women, and when he finally finds one she ends up by rejecting him. Travis feels like it is the moment to 'clean' the city, and this leads him to take certain decisions in an attempt to prove something. As the movie progress his behavior turns violent and we are there watching him. We observe the evolution of Travis and what he really wants to do. We don't know where Travis comes from or about his past, but we get to know enough of him. The ending of the film can be seen both as an irony or (as some reviewers have stated) simply as a dream Travis always wanted to have, given the mysterious nature of this last scene. <br/><br/>Scorsese's style of direction fits the film, which moves smoothly as the narrative progresses. The cinematography of Michael Chapman is excellent, contrasting New York city lights and scenes inside and outside the cab in a outstanding way. Bernard Herrmann's score (which is his last) gives the film an appropriate atmosphere, although I have to complain that the main theme repeats very often in the movie.<br/><br/>Similar to what he would do years later in ""Raging Bull"", Scorsese explores the mind of his protagonist and Paul Schrader's screenplay let us know enough of Travis' thoughts using narration, although I feel the story is not as deep as it could have been, resulting in a more simple approach. The acting is excellent. Robert de Niro embodies Travis in a very convincing way and it may be one of his best performances. The supporting roles are also compelling, with good performances from Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, and Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, Travis' romantic interest. One surprising role is that of 14-year old Jodie Foster as a child prostitute, a role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award despite her short screen time and obviously her age.<br/><br/>Great as ""Taxi Driver"" is, I couldn't help but finding some faults. The film is not for everyone and sometimes it is uncomfortable to watch. The dark portrait of the character, the themes presented, and the violence near the end of the film are disturbing. Some of the scenes move slowly and some of them seem like they have no meaning at all. ""Taxi Driver"" is not my favorite film from Martin Scorsese, but like ""Raging Bull"" it portrays a man's life and hell, and how the world he lives in affects him and causes he takes decisions that may even have not crossed his mind in the first place.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is an imperfect but thought-provoking psychological drama, with an extraordinary performance from Robert de Niro, and a classic in its own right.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.8"
"mbuchwal","Null","2","5","20 February 2005"," What's the point?
","This is a strange mesmerizing film that cruelly preys upon the audience's willingness to identify with the psychotic main character, allegedly in order to teach a moral lesson. But what lesson?<br/><br/>Many of the audience may not have been aware that the movie had a religious message, thinking instead that it was yet another warning against the violence brought back from Viet Nam by frustrated soldiers such as the one portrayed by Robert DeNiro. But this does not seem to be all that the film makers intended.<br/><br/>Scorsese, the director, today is a major academic critic and professor of the art. His work may be regarded as the embodiment of his political philosophy and critical theories. In an interview, he announced to the world that he was a ""Catholic film maker,"" and referred to the final bloodletting scenes in ""Taxi Driver"" as a form of ritual sacrifice. Precisely what did he mean? <br/><br/>It is not the kind of Christian message that Hollywood movies have traditionally given, but one which may be informed by the director's peculiar approach to film making. Scorsese is a foremost proponent of the Hollywood noir style. He mocks liberal faith in the blessings of democracy and the forces of law and order (as against the teachings and methods of religion, I presume). <br/><br/>In ""Taxi Driver,"" Scorsese puts the six-gun armed ""Travis"" through a grotesque, seemingly random series of pointless adventures that end in a very ironic and unromantic way. This is a studied use of noir effect that mocks the Hollywood man of action and action genre films. Its pessimistic, bleak message seems to be that life is filled with ugliness and misery, which cannot be cured by action. But it says this in a bizarre, unrealistic way that has more to do with feelings about art than feelings about life.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was much questioned even when it was under production and there was plenty of critical scorn after it came out. A director acquaintance of mine who attended NYU film school (where Scorsese taught) responded to ""Taxi Driver"" this way at the time, ""man, that stuff is more dangerous than you think. Someone out there (the hinterlands) is gonna see that and do something really deadly."" His prediction came true and the country was nearly plunged into chaos at a time when we could ill afford any disturbances in the social order. Shouldn't the movie have taught a lesson against specifically that type of violence?<br/><br/>Apparently, the religious message was a bit obscure, because someone in the audience who desperately needed guidance, certainly didn't get the point."
"Cheetah-6","7","2","5","18 October 2001"," Memorable Feel Bad Film
","25 years later this film still holds up as an outstanding work for Scorsese and De Niro. The accolades have already been laid out here in abundance and are very true.  Artful, stylish direction by Scorsese and a totally convincing performance by De Niro.  The soundtrack is effective and powerful and the supporting performance by Jodie Foster is remarkable.  <br/><br/>It can be hard to praise a film that is so good at making us feel so bad. But this films is one of the best at doing just that. Made in 1976 this film has become somewhat prophetic in it's portrayal of the lonely, isolated, misfit in our society who sincerely wants to connect but can't and eventually turns violent. John Hinkley Jr. even mentioned this movie in his explanation of his attempt to impress Jodie Foster by trying to assassinate President Reagan.   <br/><br/>In the movie, the character Betsy,  played by Cybil Shepard, mentions a line from a Kris Kristofferson song that reminds her of the central character, Travis.  After a recent viewing of this film these lines written by another well known songwriter came to mind:<br/><br/>""now they take him and they teach him and groom him for life, and they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill"" ""he's hell bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill. all he believes are his eyes and his eyes just tell him lies."" ""now who's gonna take away his licence to kill?""  <br/><br/>And then there's the ending. <br/><br/>The ending is definitely the weak point of this work.  As stated by another commentator it should have ended with Travis and his mock suicide with his bloody finger pointed to his head. His becoming a hero seems odd and unrealistic. The appearance of him being all better at the end comes off naive. Sort of a wrap it up quick and tidy TV ending.<br/><br/>A poor ending to an otherwise outstanding and memorable film."

","Taxi Driver is an action movie without any action. It is a suspense thriller without any suspense. It is a love story without any love story.

Only Charles Bronson can pull off these vigilante roles with passion and he has a better moustache. De Niro tries hard to copy his mentor Bronson but just doesn't make the grade. De Niro's moustache looks fake and unconvincing in this. Scorcese's movie does not have half the style and shock value as Michael Winner's Death Wish. The performances here are lazy. The camera-work is not as good as Death Wish. The camera shot of Bickle's tablets fizzing in water was lifted from a Michael Winner documentary in which he is filmed eating a burger ( no ketchup) as the camera hones in on the burger on his plate.<br/><br/>A word of advice, Scorcese: Leave the big city angst stories to Michael Winner, the true captain of street realism..."

","This movie joins the likes of Dr. Strangelove, Citizen Kane, and 2001: A Space Odyssey . It's not clever at all and it's about nothing. Some mentally ill taxi driver boogies around at night - That's all. Most of the film is taken up by slow scenes, totally unrealistic dialogue and situations, and a totally unrealistic portrayal of New York, yet Taxi Driver is currently rated 8.4 on IMDb.<br/><br/>There are two reasons for this: One is that wannabe gangsters will vote any film like this high, and the other is that people like Roger Ebert are the perfect example of a modern day Emperor's New Clothes. If the plot and script are nonsensical, they'll hail it a masterpiece and tell you that you are just too stupid to see the genius involved (for the record, 2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't have ANY story at all, but is still called ""deep""). Those of us with an ounce of sanity are not happy sitting through a film that's about nothing (with the exception of a few scenes with Jodie Foster, who plays an underage prostitute) and has a pace slower than a tortoise on whiskey.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, but the talent is wasted on a script as crap as this.<br/><br/>I'd only recommend watching this to tick the 'seen it' box."

","Movies are meant to entertain right? The primary focus of a movie should be to distract right? If you sincerely believe that stay as far away from Taxi Driver (1976) as you possibly can. It's not that Taxi Driver is boring, far from it. It's that it doesn't sugarcoat or enthrall its audience with flashy special-effects or a twisty- turny tale. It's a movie about being; specifically a movie about being the darkest most menacing version of yourself. It's a movie that forces you to confront and battle your innermost demons and you may not like who you are by the end of it.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a Vietnam veteran looking for a job. After a short interview he's given the graveyard shift at a Taxi company thus exhausting the small, slim cords that tether him to the faulty structures of the human condition. He meets an underage prostitute (Jodie Foster) an aspiring Presidential Candidate (Leonard Harris), a homicidal cuckold (the director himself) among a menagerie of different characters all peeling away at his inner psyche. That is when he isn't doing that to himself in his isolated apartment.<br/><br/>When first watching Taxi Driver I watched it on the 14"" screen of my old college TV set. I lived alone in a basement apartment next to the University and I worked nights as a University Police helper of sorts. I had no girlfriend and angry because of it. I had a handful of friends who I was ""too busy for"" and parents I still resented because I was still technically a teenager. I almost wept watching Taxi Driver because I felt Bickle's isolation. I automatically sympathized with the character on a most intimate level...then the third act of the film started.<br/><br/>A progression of events turn Bickle from a well-meaning if socially inept loner into a monster of sorts. Everything became a blur of violence and reactionary machismo. I no longer knew him. I no longer knew myself. He was a funhouse mirror of who I could possibly become. It was downright scary. <br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese eases the audience into his grimy nocturnal New York City by first showcasing the alternatives; the moral compasses of fellow cab driver Wizard (Peter Boyle) and Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) a campaign worker who Travis fancies. Wizard shows concern for Travis but every time he attempts to connect Travis bristles. Betsy is uneasy around Travis and ultimately his attempts to woe her fall embarrassingly flat, further pushing him into isolation and the hellish cityscape. His last solace is Jodie Foster, a runaway and prostitute who is being taken advantage of by her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel). His attempt to redeem himself through her becomes the violent and ultimately selfish conclusion to his sordid tale.<br/><br/>There is a popular film theory that Bickle suffered from PTSD which while probably true I feel takes away from the movie's universal impact. I am a larger fan of Slavoj Zizek's analysis where he claims Taxi Driver is a loose remake of The Searchers (1956). In both a cynical anti-hero and veteran attempts to save a young woman from what he doesn't really understand. When ""successful"" they are unable to return to the life they had. Like a fallen angel Travis, like Ethan in The Searchers is still alone and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>When I think of the hatemongers of the KKK or the misogynistic voices of the ""Men's Rights Movement"" I think of Travis Bickle and by extension my college-aged self. All want to accomplish what they feel are worthwhile goals but do so as reactionaries. Some have been known to be borderline violent and all see through a lens of selfishness. Thankfully I grew out of that stage in my life and while I can't 100% pin that maturity on Taxi Driver I can say that Taxi Driver is an uncomfortable watch that made me a slightly better person.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

"Spleen","5","2","6","15 December 2002"," Perfect (perhaps), but minor
","Spoilers follow...<br/><br/>I don't get the ending. And I'm not alone. Some find it so disjointed that they doubt it's even really part of the story; perhaps it's just Travis's fantasy, or a literal representation of the kind of ""redemption"" Travis really wants (and does not get because he in fact dies shortly after the shoot-out), or some such.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert rightly dismisses such worries, but in the wrong way. ""Whether Travis gains [what he wants] in reality or only in his mind is not the point; throughout the film, his mental state has shaped his reality, and at last, in some way, it has brought him a kind of peace."" Forget that Ebert doesn't realise that the ending is a miserable one however we take it: is he really, seriously saying that it doesn't matter whether this is a story about a man who really does by some fluke come to be accepted and loved and admired, or a story about a man who merely fantasises about being accepted and loved and admired when he isn't really? How could this crucial question not matter?<br/><br/>I'm not sure, but I think the ending ISN'T real; whether it's a dream Travis actually experiences as he dies, or a screen depiction (made by Scorsese, for our benefit) of the kind of outcome Travis had been hoping for, is something I'm even less sure about. That I don't know is not surprising, given how few hints Scorsese is willing to drop. But why don't I even care? Why do I feel that Ebert has a point, and that none of this DOES matter?<br/><br/>The trouble with this exceptionally well-made film is that it's every bit as narcissistic as Travis is. To the narcissist, nothing in the external world is quite real; to the film, and us watching the film, all of New York  feels as though it has no existence apart from Travis's highly coloured impressions of it. Is the place REALLY full of ""scum""? Are things really as bad as they appear to Travis? Who knows? The film, as I said, is exceptionally well made. The editing is arresting; the music and cinematography are flawless. But there's little point, and no soul. The world into which we're drawn consists of the subjective impressions of one very limited person; nothing else. Director (Scorsese), writer (Schrader) and actor (De Niro), all three at the height of their powers, concentrate their efforts on drawing us into the world of a man who concentrates HIS energy on pushing people away  us included.<br/><br/>That ""Taxi Driver"" is the best possible example of the very kind of film its creators intended it to be does NOT make it the great film so many people think it is. I'm not saying a word against it. I can find no positive fault. The film is not flawed; it merely lacks those virtues that true masterpieces have. It's not that it's more poorly made than (to take the film that *I* think is the finest made in the 1970s) ""Barry Lyndon""; it's just that ""Barry Lyndon"" is a nobler kind of thing altogether."

I first got into this movie after watching ""Joker"" and I was a little anticipated. So after watching it, I gotta say that this is one of the greatest films ever made.
When you watch this film for the first time, you know you're in for a dangerous feel despite the fact that the film is violent. Which is a driving force of the film and the main character, the film tells us that being lonely is a terrible thing. The score by Bernard Hermann is also jazzy and intense in the beginning, but most importantly masterful. The actors play their performances amazingly especially for Robert De Niro when he was in his 30s back then and also Martin Scorsese, who is one of the greatest directors working today.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This film launched De Niro into stardom and for good reason. He gets into the psyche of a lonely and isolated man named Travis; a man clueless of many social norms. Yet he has an erratic moral compass. Travis is fed up with the filth that embodies much of the city he lives in and the uncouth population around him has overwhelmed his rickety mental state. When he does try to interact with a decent person he fails, which sends him into an even more precarious mental place. Deep down he means well and tries to do the right thing in his own 'special' way. What will he do and whose lives will he alter? The dark, gritty and gloomy 70s cinematography is complimented by unflinching and atmospheric music that envelops Travis in his despair. There is an important moment late in the film that can send Travis into two completely different directions. Interesting to ponder his fate after that moment as what was or could have been. This film has many memorable and parodied dialog bits and Travis's appearance late in the film is unforgettable. This is a somber character study where everything feels realistic."

","Robert Di Niro's character Travis is a discharged ex-marine who after suffering insomnia after the war, tries to fill his time. after becoming a taxi driver he falls for a woman who doesn't want him. His descent into madness begins with her rejection and some encouragement from unhappy cab riders. While his attempt to assassinate a local politician is futile, he saves an escort from abusive pimps, all while ending up in a coma. the film ends as he returns to his life as a normal taxi driver. The smooth jazz throughout the movie is a nice feel to the nighttime city setting. Over all very well made, De Niro's character radically changed throughout the film but all played out nicely in the end."

","Fantastic filmmaking, an outstanding cast, and cinematography that manages to be artistic and elevating, and yet also captures the grime and filth of New York City's seedier areas in the 1970's. Seriously, I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. That's also because the film is dark, and in several ways. It has an anti-hero who is a disturbed, pathetic loner. Child prostitution. Scenes that seem to glorify guns and violence. And an awful ending (and no, I'm not buying the dream theory). I believe it's all meant to be a brutal (and realistic) indictment of America, but it seems to me it also revels a bit in the mire of this grim world, and ironically glorifies some of the very things it's critiquing. I loved the shots of New York at night, and the effects with light, such as when they come through the back of the taxicab out of focus. I thought Jodie Foster at 14 was brilliant, and Robert De Niro (""You talkin' to me?"") was as well. I admire Scorsese the artist, but this one was too disturbing for me to want to see again (though I said the same thing when I first saw it years ago). Poke around and see how many people view Travis Bickle as a hero, instead of seeing in him what isolation, failure, frustration, and mental illness inevitably lead to, and you may get an idea of what I mean."

Martin Scorsese has crafted a moody drama film set in his native streets of New York and the cinematography is sublime. It makes you feel uneasy because you are on the level of Travis.

","The story of Travis Bickle is one of sadness loneliness and redemption Taxi shows what it is like for a person to be living in a world which does not want to except he exsists and Travis has a arc which shows that people who are alone need attention and for Travis his way to get attention means he tangles in things he shouldn't be tangled in and in the end he is the perfect anti hero.
The cast is one of the best that has been Put to film With Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle is one of his best roles in his career and it shows also in the cast is a young Jodie Foster As Iris who is a child prostitute who at first does not care for Travis but in the end i think that she works out Travis was the first person to look after her and she was almost the only one who excepted Travis for who he was. also in the cast was Cybill Shepherd who was Betsy who was a possible love interest for Travis and while i think that in the begining and until the end scence with Travis in the Taxi she never really got him and the lack of understanding ment that travis became distant to her and doing more to try to recive the attention he wants and yet i never thought that she was ever intersted in Travis and she was in the end the character who would never truly understand him also special mention to Leonard Harris who played Charles Palantine who was the sterotype of all politions of the 70s and he only cared about in the end himself and even though i think he was interested in how Travis ticked he was a minor character who was symbolic in the sense that Travis admired and in a way hated him and that is the outline of politions of that decade.
Taxi Driver is defiently Martin Scorsese's most bold movie that made an impact and that was obvouis with the outline of the movie but also in a way it was showing that if a person spends too much time alone they can go insane and eventually Travis becomes a hero but at what cost he does so much damage trying to clean up the New York streets that you don't relise that while Travis has a sorta crazy way of doing it and yet you know what he is going to do so in a way he is the ultimate anti hero and is story is one that while being filled with sadness will tragicly beautiful and another special mention to Bernard Herrmann who composed the theme for Taxi Driver and it is amazing and it fits the tone of the movie in it's intirety and in all ways it's perfect and so is the movie and if you have not seen it it you have to you will not regret it"

Seeing the world through his eyes and how his surroundings affect his mental state is really fascinating. De Niro's performance is among his finest and most memorable!"
"aasthat-98209","10","1","2","5 June 2018"," Very Powerful movie even NOW! Best so far.
","I have seen this movie 3 times. Today when I watched it again, I was thinking what a wonderful masterpiece it is. I've always loved De Niro, not just for how handsome he is but how good he is at dialogue delivery and expressions. Also, other reason that I might be biased towards writing only positive comments about this movie is because of the director, Martin Scorsese. These two have never disappointed me in the work they do. 
Talking about the movie, which can be considered more about a story of a taxi driver named Travis Bickle starts with his little introduction that he served in Army and he is a Marine veteran. This introduction establishes a lot about why Travis behaved certain way in rest of the film. The way Scorsese has directed the movie by unfolding about Travis's character is just brilliant. You will learn so much about Travis's character that not just he hates all the filth in New York but also how the small things that he notices everyday during his job affects him. For example, the guy who sits in the taxi and talks about how he is gonna kill his wife and her lover for infidelity. All the loneliness in Travis's life, the filthiness around the city and his past encounter with violence make him want to go back to being violent.
Travis's life in the movie is shown to be very lonely. But, it's shown that he does like a girl and go after her. But, after she stops taking her calls. His dialogue that says a lot about how he feels about people, "" I realize now how much she's just like the others, cold and distant, and many people are like that, women for sure, they're like a union.""
Travis wants to save the world from that filth and it can be seen when he says ""Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up.""
To sum up, the movie depicts urban alienation and loneliness very well with great acting by Robert De Niro. It shows how Travis starting as just a cabbie end up saving a child prostitute by killing some people and becoming the hero he wanted to be."

","This movie tells the story of an ex marine insomniac Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) who drives a taxi cab.

This causes Travis to become obsessed with trying to change New York City and rid it of all the ""scum"" and ""filth"" in it. Were he then goes to a local whorehouse and massacres all of the men in control.<br/><br/>The fear of the rising of crime-levels of the 1970's is a fear that Scorcese played on in this film.

","It has been fun watching this movie for the forth or fifth time. I tend to find new things every time I see it again. DeNiro truly captures the nuances of a troubled soul, and I;m sure he did some painstaking research on the subject with the crew and director. There was no spectacular camera work done, as far as I'm concerned, but it's okay because the narrative and characters just keep the film going on their own. There are obviously some disturbing subject matters covered in this story, and that's part of the drive in getting you, the viewer, to have perhaps some empathy for the taxi driver played by DeNiro. I'm sure it's funny for many millennials to see old footage of NYC. Far cry from the gentrified state it is in now. The entire cast was incredible, and one really starts to feel bad for DeNiro throughout the film. I will always recommend this film to others."

","When I heard of this movie, Taxi Driver, I was instantly interested in it for two reasons. One of which is because Martin Scorsese directed it and another is Robert De Niro. In my eyes Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time and every De Niro film is a hit. Taxi Driver takes you deep inside the mind of a veteran marine and his life as a taxi driver. Later becoming a vigilante to clean up the streets of pimps and crime. I felt De Niro did an absolutely amazing job portraying this mentally psychotic bad ass in my opinion. The cinematography in this film is done so well in this film, in particular, all the night scenes I felt had this gloomy and captivating mood to it through low lighting, shadows, and the diegetic sound you could hear. Overall, incredible film. Can't believe it took me this long to watch this film."
"boeseadamj","9","1","2","7 December 2016"," An isolated NYC taxi driver gets fed up with the apathetic city he lives in.
","This film is madly interesting. Its examination of Travis makes me examine my own morals. The murder of the pimps in itself is less problematic than Travis's motivations. Travis's loneliness reaches the audience on some visceral level as well as his disgust with society to some extent. But their is still something unnerving about him as a character and I feel uncomfortable condoning his actions even though I sort of do. And that is a really powerful struggle that this film conveys. A disturbing and alienating view of this character that the audience still understands. I also appreciate the very strong visual storytelling that this film contains. Martin Scorsese is a master behind the camera, especially during scenes like the classic mirror scene, or alka seltzer close up. The decision to hold the camera just a little longer than perhaps some other directors is very bold, not to mention effective."
"bahramrasti","10","1","2","29 August 2016"," Character study of the main character of Taxi driver in a glance.
","Scorsese has made plenty of great movies in the past. In recent years he made few good ones as well and hopefully he will continue to do so in The future. Taxi driver is one of his earlier work to mark his visual style as an author. Together with his main actor 'Deniro', he manages to create an underdog character in a post Vietnam New York city and tackles on some psychological aspects of his main character. Scorsese invites us into the mind of his unconventional and non stereotyped character and made him as believable as sympathetic. In this movie we are faced with Travis's gradual shift in his sanity. Scorsese manages to make Deniro's character in a way that it's hard for the viewers not to sympathize with his. One should also give Deniro credit for his abilities as an actor. It seems that the director and the main actor understood each other well and had the same goal in mind in respect to Travis's mental state and motives. I recommend everyone who is interested in art of filmmaking to view this movie deeply."
"hikerhetav","8","1","2","17 August 2016"," Alcoholic cinematography and intoxicating music!
","This is what I start Martin Scorsese's movies with. Definitely a gem in very unique and tonic way. In my journey of movies so far, I never felt so much of refreshed after watching a long queue of nice and worse movies. This definitely doesn't lie in the later section. Martin Scorsese directed this in a ravishing, prepossessing and hedonistic modus operandi. From start to finish, each detail, each scene, each shot is taken in alluring way that the viewer get as much possible attached to the movie and never get back even after finishing up movie. Of course, script was much good and Scorsese put up his whole heart and even though there were flaws but this movie is really striking. <br/><br/>The script has its problems. Writing is a bit lousy. Character development takes much longer time. And the real deal starts with second half. This is what make movie stretchy and overly done. But again, does this affect anything else important in this movie? Check it out:<br/><br/>Direction- Top notch. Acting- Robert De Niro in his complete form. Give blows when needed. Cinematography- This is what makes the movie more emblazoned. Look out for sure. Background music- Makes you addicted with the movie. <br/><br/>Oh God! I couldn't believe I finally watched this movie which I was craving for since I joined IMDb. Again, De Niro would be proud of himself characterizing himself in such a bold role and I guess most of the viewers of Taxi Driver won't be able to forget Travis Bickle in their life."
"grantss","10","1","2","13 March 2016"," Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece
","Gritty, enthralling and iconic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is a New York taxi driver. He is also socially awkward, a loner, an insomniac, a Vietnam veteran and has issues. He sees the criminals - prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers etc - on the streets and views them as dirt, and wishes that a rain would come to wash them away. Initially he is just talk but over time he becomes more angry, bitter, delusional and open to vigilantism and taking matters into his own hands...<br/><br/>Brilliant movie by Martin Scorsese. He builds up the story well - first painting Bickle as all talk and no action but then showing us how he develops more into a man of action...radical action. Even once it is obvious that Bickle is now beyond just talking about doing something, you don't know how it is going to pan out. Scorsese toys with the audience, giving us a red herring as the entrÃ©e for the final showdown. Even then there's another twist in store...<br/><br/>This slow-burning build up and portrayal of the escalation of Bickle's outlook is superbly aided by a searingly good performance by Robert De Niro as Bickle. He inhabits the character, and a very complex character it is. I doubt that anyone else could have played Bickle that convincingly.<br/><br/>De Niro got a Best Actor Oscar nomination and was only prevented from getting the award by an equally brilliant Peter Finch, for Network.<br/><br/>Good support from Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Albert Brooks. Foster was 13 years old at the time and got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","2","7 March 2016"," Way Ahead of its TIme
","Upon revisiting this film for a college course I realized a few things; One being that Robert De Niro may have never given a better performance than Travis Bickle, two being that this film was way more ahead of its time than many 70's noir thrillers, and three being Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. Sure all things many people knew already, but for some reason didn't resonate with me the first time.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver tells the unfortunate story of Travis Bickle, an ex- marine just returning from his time in Vietnam who struggles to cope with paranoid psychosis in 1970's New York. Beginning and ending with trippy colors and stylish music from Bernard Hermann, Taxi Driver gets under your skin only when it wants to and in the most in opportune times. It succeeds in giving you the uncomfortable feeling and anguish most associated with noir and it does so in fashion.<br/><br/>Bickle's skepticism and cynical view of New York City is perfectly portrayed by De Niro as we root for him the entire length of the movie. All of this tends to get him into trouble, but we don't care, because we are so sucked into Bickle's every move and every word that we don't tend to notice just how insane he has become. Of course, the film is iconic for its famous ""You talking to me?"" line and its brutally violent climax, but its Scorsese's direction of De Niro's performance I will remember most.<br/><br/>With this film comes plenty of questions as to whether or not any of it is actually real or not, which in most cases is valid. But I don't really care one way or another. No matter what, this is a tragic tale of a man lost in a world that he doesn't understand and a world that doesn't understand him. Whether or not the engaging narration is misleading is up to interpretation, but I just know that it's a wonderfully intricate story of a troubled Taxi Driver. If De Niro's encapsulating performance isn't enough for you than perhaps Scorsese's brilliant direction and Bernard Hermann's hauntingly beautiful and stylish score will be. Taxi Driver is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>+De Niro is an all-time best<br/><br/>+Scorsese's meticulous direction<br/><br/>+Engaging in an unfortunately tragic way<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Noir way ahead of its time<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"lesleyharris30","7","1","2","28 February 2016"," Not Scorsese's Best, although the Performances are Outstanding,
","Taxi Driver is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. The highlight of the entire movie would have to be the actors, Robert De Niro shines as Travis Bickle, one of his deepest and most intense performances, the best scenes had to be between him and a very young Jodie Foster, their on screen chemistry is sublime, you could see that she understood acting from a very young age. However, I found it hard to get pulled in to this story, mainly because Travis was not a likable character, he's strange, suspicious and we are never made entirely clear of his intentions, the final scene is outstanding, but somewhat confusing, he may have been saving this girl but it was far more extreme than anything he had done previously, which made sense, but there was not enough build up to drive the character to that level of insanity, I understand that he is an anti-hero, but I had no support for him whatsoever. I think Cybil Shepherd was miscast in this movie and is without a doubt my least favourite part, she had no chemistry with De Niro, I know she was suppose to be confused and unsure of her love for Bickle, but I felt nothing from her, she was reading her lines. The story is also quite messy, I expected better from Scorsese, Travis goes from an everyday taxi driver to a corrupt one so easily that we never feel a proper transition, he seems to become crazier by each scene for no apparent reason, and a proper arch to this story does not come around till we meet Foster's character, but this still feels underdeveloped, their relationship could have been established more, so that the last ten minutes would not just feel like they were tying up loose ends. I am a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, and while I appreciate their work on Taxi Driver, I have come to expect more from the people who brought me such greats as Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Goodfellas, but it's an iconic movie that should not be missed by any movie buff. <br/><br/>A troubled man spirals in to vigilantism and revenge while working with a taxi service. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert De Niro"
"invertedforest-70474","10","1","2","20 December 2015"," Travis
","Travis Bickle is an attractive character for me, although he is not a right minded person. He is a lonely man in a big city, because he doesn't understand how to communicate with others, I think. When I watch this film, I can sympathize with this lonely man. He always tries to act for his belief. I'm interested in him by watching those scenes that he is perplexed between his belief and the real around him. However, that situation would happen with everyone more or less. So Travis is the character who I can sympathize with, although I cannot do like him. From the beginning to the end, some of the audience could sympathize, I think."

You really feel as if you are in this 1970's version of NYC following this crazed man around. The camera work is spot on as well, with long tracking shots of our driver and aerial shots of his destruction, Scorsese does an amazing job directing.

Editing was superb as well, keeping the pace going it what's actually kinda a slow film. It doesn't feel slow at all. Even with the awkward moments, there's enough tension there, like where he is in the political crowd, or introducing himself to the girl at the office, or just walking up the stairs to the apt. rooms, that I'm not bored in the slightest.

There's a lot of moments that stand out and can be remembered, especially the scene circling Robert De Niro's most famous quote. Its buildups and reveals are fantastic, especially when you first see his new look. The reason I love it is because of its simplicity (most notably during the salesman scene), but also because it's an excellent anti-hero film... one that's believable and deep.

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","1","2","13 November 2014"," There is good in every person, as Taxi Driver proves
","Taxi Driver is a very simple title for such a powerful movie, the strange story of a kind but mentally unstable ex- Vietnam soldier who at first seems like the biggest psycho in town. Living in an urban area by day and driving a taxi through busy streets full of what he calls ""scum of the earth"", he plots in his slipping mind to tear down the neon signs and drugs and corrupt politicians in what he calls ""the rain"". Things only get worse when his sudden love interest, Betsy, rejects him after he awkwardly takes her to a porno movie and she sees something sinister in him.<br/><br/>Well, poor Travis may be falling off the deep end but he will do something good before he snaps completely. A thirteen-year-old prostitute, who calls herself ""Easy"" (her real name is Iris), thinks the life of a hooker is glamorous and cool, but she fails to realize that if she doesn't head back home to Pittsburgh soon, she'll be trapped in that kind of life forever. Travis ""buys"" her but not to do anything with but to convince her that the streets is no place for a kid. After giving her every last cent of his money to help get her home, he dedicates his own life to stopping the man who has her under his control.<br/><br/>One thing you've got to take note of, whether you enjoy this film or not, is the amazing acting job from all members of the cast, especially Jodie Foster, who was already acting in two other major roles that year (Echoes of a Summer and The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane). And Taxi Driver proves that no matter how far gone a person is, they always have the potential to do good. Travis saved the life of a little girl and although ""off"" at the best of times he certainly wasn't a monster. If you're a fan of the X - Files, you might recall the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). His character was certainly corrupt but he had a difficult life and did do some good things. Just like him, Travis in Taxi Driver has a bad side, but also a good one that shines through in the end. Like the C.S.M. Travis is very mysterious and viewers never know whether he'll do good or bad, even at the ending.<br/><br/>A few reviews mentioned that the movie was perverse and that it had pedophilia in it (Iris). But it was all acting, there was nothing really going on, and it served a purpose, it was supposed to seem really perverted and wrong. Because it is. Despite prostitution being illegal in Canada, Vancouver still has cases all the time where girls even younger than Iris are ""recruited"" as prostitutes. They're usually either confused runaways, kidnapping victims or addicts. So if Canada still has this issue, it's much worse in the United States. Taxi Driver is not some sick film for pedophiles to enjoy, it's a movie about a man who has lost everything in life but has the chance to make a difference in someone elses'.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was great, that nostalgic 1970's stuff that today you can get really cheap at record stores because sadly it's no longer a popular genre. The plot was original, and Taxi Driver is certainly up there as one of the best 1970's - no, one of the best ever - movies around. I highly recommend it."

","Martin Scorsese's acclaimed film, Taxi Driver, provides viewers with an excellent example of a character study film done right. Through violence, sorrow, and disgust, the film is a one of a kind directed perfectly by Scorsese. Taxi Driver follows the life of a lonely and frustrated New York City cab driver, Travis Bickle, played wonderfully by Robert De Niro. Travis is a Vietnam vet now suffering from insomnia, and he takes a job as a night shift cabbie. As one would expect of late nights in New York, Travis is a witness of all types of sleazy late-night activities, such as prostitution and drug dealing. Travis begins to become increasingly frustrated with all the immorality and the direction that the world is headed in. His strong opinions and personality pushes most people away from him; he develops a short, and failed love interest with woman named Betsy, who works for the campaign of want to be senatorial candidate Charles Palantine. Travis becomes concerned with a twelve- year-old prostitute, played by Jodie Foster, and is determined to save her from her pimp. After all the desperation and frustration, a sense of self-righteousness develops within Travis, and he takes a course of action to try and make the world fit his mold of what an ideal society should be. Scorsese helps to show that a lavishly decorated movie, starring an exuberant cast of characters is not needed to create a widely acclaimed masterpiece. Scorsese's film featured a bleak and disturbing main character, and does not leave the viewer feeling happy upon finishing it, yet you cannot help but recognize its greatness. Taxi Driver shares many similarities, but it also has many differences compared to Scorsese's other works. Like many of his other films, the cinematography is arguably the strongest element of the film, and the awkward dialogue paired with Travis' internal dialogue creates a very unique film. The film also incorporates crime into it like many other great Scorsese films such as Goodfellas, and The Departed. Unlike the mentioned films however, Taxi Driver does not have any sort of mafia theme in it like a lot of Scorsese's previous works. In terms of characters as well, the characters in Taxi Driver are for the most part outwardly mundane and un-exciting. This film does not have wild and outspoken characters such as Joe Pesci or Mark Wahlberg from Scorsese's works, and instead focuses on the internal problems of Travis and the rotting of New York City. The social commentary of this film hits on two different areas. The first, is the psychological impact of the Vietnam War. While the film never makes clear that the reasons for Travis' insomnia and other psychological problems are related to the war, it does not seem too far fetched to assume that the war definitely had some sort of impact. The commentary tries to show the lasting pain and psychological problems the war had on its participants, and is most likely a subtle criticism of the whole war in general. In regards to the war however, the film's clear and main point is to show the negative and lasting affects of the experience on the returning soldiers. The other realm of the film's commentary has to do with New York City, at the time the movie was made. Taxi Driver shows the deteriorating state of New York and in some ways is a plea for help. Travis is obviously not the figure Scorsese wants to help fix the city, but he uses Travis to show the desperation that is needed for help. This film deserves a 9 out of 10 stars. The development of Robert De Niro's character from a frustrated cab driver to a wannabe martyr is acted out perfectly. The film does an amazing job of stirring up emotions despite the lack of overt emotion within the film. The viewer feels the pain and sorrow that Travis somehow manages to hide, and becomes frustrated when Travis does not realize the disgust of his actions. The greatness of the movie is in its ability to keep the viewer engaged when quite often, while at times the film seems stagnant The film's strongest element is quite possibly the cinematography. From the close up scenes, the moments of silence, and the score, Taxi Driver has the total package when it comes to cinematography. As many have said before, Taxi Driver features one of the best-shot scenes of all time. The scene where Travis is trying to make contact with Betsy on the phone and the camera pans over to a barren hallway is the one in reference. This scene is so great because you feel Travis' emotions, and when the camera goes over to the hallway it's as if Scorsese is telling the viewer to not look at the pain Travis is feeling. The barren hallway is also a metaphor for Travis' life as it is simply empty and lonely. The arc of Travis is another interesting element of the film. Travis' arc from a low life cabbie toward redemption does not feel forced and is developed in a way that feels realistic. By about the halfway point, Travis' desire to take matters into his own hands, in regards to cleaning up the city, begins to take action, and in his mind will lead to him becoming a hero. The third stand out element of the film is the conflict, and the films ability to create great external and internal conflict. The external conflict of the film has to do with the state of city which is filled with prostitution, violence, and other forms of crime. The internal conflict is Travis' own personal battle with his psychological problems and his loneliness caused by his off- putting personality. Taxi Driver does not feature any sort of explosions, quirky dialogue, or have a Hollywood ending, but is a film that can still be appreciated today. Taxi Driver holds up to the test of time thirty-eight years later."

"jcbutthead86","10","1","2","3 August 2014"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful And Unforgettable Masterpiece Of Cinema. Martin Scorsese And Robert De Niro At Their Best.
","Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing direction powerful performances from Robert De Niro and a great cast,a terrific script and a fantastic score. All of those elements make Taxi Driver one my favorite movies and Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro at their best.<br/><br/>Set in New York City,Taxi Driver tells the story of Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro),a Vietnam veteran and Marine who drives a Taxi mostly at night and makes good money. But Travis is a loner,depressed,mentally disturbed and is sick of the disgusting things he sees on the streets with criminals,drug pushers,pimps and lowlifes so Travis decides to take the law in his own hands. While taking the law into his own hands Travis sees a young Prostitute(Jodie Foster)from pimps and decides to rescue her.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a brilliant and riveting masterpiece and instant classic from the first time you watch it where just about everything from the acting,direction and screenplay are all are perfect and flawless and was the second collaboration between director Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro after the amazing and underrated classic Mean Streets in 1973. Taxi Driver is also one of the main movies of the New Hollywood era of the 70s is one of the greatest films of the 1970s that years after it's release in 1976 never loses it's impact. Taxi Driver is a film that right from the very start pulls viewers into a nightmare that never lets go until the end and is a film that is dark and violent as well as very bleak and uncompromising with harsh and gritty style that is all it's own. Taxi Driver is also one of the best films about New York City and I think the depiction of the city adds to Taxi Driver's atmosphere which is grim. The city of New York in Taxi Driver is filthy and dirty showing viewers how most of New York City was during the 1970s with pimps,drug dealers,prostitutes and violence that was on the New York streets at that time. Scorsese captures the insanity of New York showing a place where nothing is cleaned up. Taxi Driver also shows the fear and paranoia of the post Vietnam,post Watergate world where some things are falling apart and there seems to be distrust and anger all around with no hope or salvation. Vigilante movies were huge during the 70s and early 1980s thanks to Death Wish and exploitation films during that period and while Taxi Driver is a vigilante movie it's much more character driven and doesn't glamorize violence. Speaking of the violence,the violence in Taxi Driver is shocking and brutal and shows violence and what it really is The screenplay by Paul Schrader is amazing,masterful and one of the best screenplays in film history with Schrader giving the script great dialog that is harsh and brooding with moments of mesmerizing depth and greatness that make the film. The main character Travis Bickle is one of the greatest,most iconic and truly unforgettable characters in movie history who is an antihero. One of the reasons Travis such a great character because we are fascinated by him at the same time disturbed by him. We are fascinated by Travis because the whole movie is seen from his point of view and we feel Bickle's isolation and the thoughts of being alone or because Travis can talk to people but not on a consistent basis and can only express himself in his diary and thoughts. We are disturbed by Travis because we don't really know if he's a hero or a villain he can be a little bit both because Bickle is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode based on his actions whether it's physical or verbal because Bickle is disturbed by his environment. The movie let's us make up our own conclusions. Travis Bickle is a classic character that you will never forget and will truly live forever,especially the classic 'you talking to me scene'. The ending of Taxi Driver is outstanding and one of best endings ever caught on film because it's a mixture of ambiguity,violence and questions that will never be answered which will cause many debates with no final conclusion. A brilliant ending to a masterful film.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific. Robert De Niro is excellent,powerful and gives one of the greatest acting performances of all-time in his most iconic role as Travis Bickle with De Niro being intense and believable. Jodie Foster is brilliant and fiery as Iris,a young hooker Travis wants to help. Harvey Keitel is riveting as Sport,Iris' pimp. Cybill Shepard is terrific and beautiful as Betsy,a woman and political campaign worker Travis likes. Albert Brooks is funny and memorable as Tom,a co-worker of Betsy's. Peter Boyle is fantastic as Wizard,a fellow Taxi driver that gives Travis some advice. Leonard Harris is wonderful as Charles Palantine,a politician running for President. Director Martin Scorsese is creepy as one of Travis passengers. Murray Moston(Iris' Timekeeper) Harry Northup(Doughboy),Steven Prince(Andy-Gun Salesman),Joe Spinell(Personnel Officer),Victor Argo(Melio)and Diahanne Abbott(Concession Girl)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Martin Scorsese is outstanding and masterful,with Scorsese constantly moving the camera with tracking shots,great angles and close-ups as well as beautiful lighting. Amazing direction,Scorsese.<br/><br/>The score by Bernard Herrmann is beautiful,haunting,memorable and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. A terrific score,Herrmann.<br/><br/>The making-up by Dick Smith is fantastic,realistic and add to the film. RIP,Mr Smith.<br/><br/>In final word if you love Martin Scorsese,Robert De Niro or films in general,I highly suggest you see Taxi Driver,an excellent and powerful masterpiece of cinema that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"Hey_Sweden","9","1","2","25 March 2014"," An incredible snapshot of 1970s NYC.
","Writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese have a very memorable vision in this highly regarded piece of work, certainly very memorable in the careers of all involved and one which of course is now extremely iconic and often quoted. More than anything else, it's the tale of a man who feels disconnected from society at large, a society which he has come to regard as filthy and corrupt and in need of a cleanup. That doesn't change the fact, however, that the man in question is mentally unbalanced and would likely never completely fit in. Therefore, an all night cab driver would seem to be the perfect occupation for him, and while on the job he meets the various flotsam and jetsam that make up the NYC population. Some viewers don't like the dark, grim, and ultimately very violent journey that this film takes us on, but to some it feels all too real.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro towers over all with his performance as alienated cabbie Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who does his best to live a normal life. The trouble is, he doesn't really know how to go about it. When he starts courting Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful worker on the presidential campaign of politician Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), his idea of a good date is taking her to see a dirty movie. During the course of this story, he chats up Palantine, arms himself to the teeth, and makes the acquaintance of people such as Wizard (Peter Boyle), a philosophical co-worker, Iris (Jodie Foster), an underage prostitute, and ""Sport"" (Harvey Keitel), Iris's degenerate pimp. It's only a matter of time until our lonely protagonist makes the descent into violence.<br/><br/>All of the parts are well cast in this thing. Even when roles aren't really integral to the story (such as Tom, played by Albert Brooks), you do appreciate their presence. Foster is absolutely incredible as the girl in need of rescuing, and Keitel is truly, excellently creepy as her employer. Familiar character players in this cast include Victor Argo, Harry Northup, and Joe Spinell. Scorseses' cameo as the sicko watching his wife's silhouette is one you don't forget.<br/><br/>Heavy assets are the vivid atmosphere and depiction of different areas of the city, especially the seamier ones, and the haunting music score by Bernard Herrmann, which turned out to be the last one by the composer. That's a very chilling opening when a cab emerges from the smoke while the main theme plays.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see why ""Taxi Driver"" would be so influential; even its detractors don't deny the massive impact that it's had on popular culture.<br/><br/>Nine out of 10."
"ZChrisJ1995","9","1","2","24 October 2013"," Stunning portrait of an alienated sociopath
","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a disturbed man. Stricken with insomnia, he decides to enrol as a taxi driver in order to pass the time. What follows is a descent into madness, brutality and vigilantism. <br/><br/>De Niro portrays the titular protagonist/antagonist in what can only be described as a masterpiece, both for him as an actor and for Martin Scorsese as a director. The film's intense depiction of urban decay, and Travis' equally intense reactions to this corruption, have gone down (and will continue to go down) as a milestone in cinematic history. <br/><br/>Initially, it is relatively easy to sympathize with Bickle. He is a lonely man, lost and without purpose. After several failed attempts at socialization, he finally manages to acquire a date with a beautiful political volunteer (Cybill Shepherd). When this ends miserably, Bickle's personality takes an even more twisted turn, with him becoming increasingly concerned with ridding the streets of New York from the scum that inhabit them and his taxi. His actions (and his motives) become more and more elusive. By the end of the film, amid all the bloodshed and mayhem, it has become nearly impossible to understand Travis. <br/><br/>Scorsese's use of New York City is remarkable, with obscure angles and shots highlighting and contributing to the alienation and seediness that Travis and the audience are made to feel. Bernard Herrmann's ominous score likewise punctuates this overbearing feeling of dread and despair. <br/><br/>Performances from now-veterans Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster all help contrast with De Niro's. Whilst Sport and Iris thrive and survive by indulging in the corruption of the city, Travis attempts to destroy this corruption, yet in doing so becomes something far more sinister. <br/><br/>The film's ending has inspired countless debates as to its meaning, with critics and audiences seeking closure. In my opinion, this lack of closure is a perfect ending, as we are left to decide whether Travis is at all redeemable, ultimately an unanswerable question. <br/><br/>If I have one complaint (and this is only a minor one), it is that the violence, due to the inevitabilities of time, has lost a bit of its impact. Today, you'll be hard-pressed not to find a modern mindless blockbuster that contains more hard-hitting violence and gore. Yet, the film's message (and a depressing one at that) remains as strong as it was thirty-six years ago. <br/><br/>Must-see viewing."

"jafar-iqbal","10","1","2","10 October 2013"," A masterclass in filmmaking and acting
","Unhinged and unable to sleep, Vietnam War veteran Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) takes up a job as night-time New York City cab driver. Amongst the filth and depravity of the night-time New York streets, Travis comes across a twelve-year old prostitute called Iris (Jodie Foster). Feeling like it is his duty to protect his preadolescent, Travis begins to succumb to a previously-suppressed urge for violence within him.<br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' easily ranks amongst the greatest films ever made, and is arguably also Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro's best film (though there are other valid contenders too). What makes the film so good is that it's the perfect snapshot of the time – late seventies, an America that is still reeling from the horrors of Vietnam, with that disillusionment and depravity so beautifully portrayed. But, despite the film being so rooted in time, it manages to remain relevant today almost 40 years later. This could be watched in 2013, and still resonate with the viewer as much as it would have done in the seventies.<br/><br/>Obviously, the main draw of the movie is Mr DeNiro. And, yes, he is incredible. From the very first shot, he is sublime. The film has often been described as a horror movie and, if you go with that line of thinking, then DeNiro is easily the monster. His cheeky grins and boyish looks are hiding a sinister side – as the film goes on, and the façade slips, Bickle becomes frightening. It's amazing to see DeNiro make that transformation.<br/><br/>In the deserved praise heaped on DeNiro, I think the power of Jodie Foster's performance is somewhat underrated. At only twelve years, having to play the role she does, Foster is amazing. Not many kids that age would play a prostitute, but she does it, and does it brilliantly. I've never been a massive fan of Foster's work, but she certainly does a stellar job in this movie.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of the movie is the score. Again, the horror movie theory is backed up by the downright frightening theme music. More than an actual tune, it is almost a warning drone. Rising brass instruments, loud and brash, it is haunting and creates the perfect ambiance for the film.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about all the other good things about the movie (Cybill Shepherd, Scorsese's cameo, the aesthetic violence, the visceral nature of the film, the script), but I'd be here forever. If you haven't seen it already, shame on you. See it now. It's an education in cinema."
"cyprejet15","10","1","2","21 August 2013"," A Masterpiece!
","Taxi Driver is among my list of favourite films of all time!<br/><br/>The story follows lead character Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro) an insomniac ex-marine who leads a lonely life. In order to make some more money, he decides to apply for a job working nights as a Taxi Driver. He attends dodgy porn theatres in the day and works long nights meeting all of New York's 'scum' as he calls them. Lots of shady characters litter the story along with a cameo from the director, Martin Scorsese in the back of his taxi cap. Travis' one desire is to be with the woman he sees so very often at the Charles Palantine building, Betsy (Cybill Shepard.) As the movie progresses, you feel an awful as you witness him reach out to people and constantly get rejected, both angering and saddening him. His mind slowly descends into madness and you get the feeling that he soon will be violently out-lashing against the society in general. He begins collecting guns and isolating himself from others; watching boring shows on television and obsessing about a twelve year old prostitute (Jodie Foster) he feels it is his duty to save. He shaves his head into the now iconic mohawk and goes on a gruesome killing spree, murdering several pimps and business men within the whore house. Travis is hailed as a hero which is an attempt to talk about society and the way in some cases, it will justify violence for the greater good. <br/><br/>To me, Travis is not a hero but at the same time he isn't your average villain. The character is very carefully crafted, giving the illusion that he is just a lonely man that wants compassion just like everybody else. The problem is, many people can see a bit of themselves within him, as Scorsese has said himself, there are real life Travis' all over the world; he is not some made up character. Robert De Niro's portrayal of a madman slowly going insane, day by day is astounding and highly convincing. This is followed by some extremely strong leads, especially notable is Iris (Jodie Foster), Betsy (Cybill Shepard) and the pimp, Sport or Matthew (Harvey Keitel.) Along with a lot of improvising throughout the scenes, the actors and actresses hold their ground very well and all portray their characters as they would appear in real life. <br/><br/>One constantly overlooked scene is in fact very significant. The scene I am talking about is the one where he brakes his television, right before, Travis is looking at a show on TV. It flashes images on couples dancing and having fun while the song 'Late For The Sky' by Jackson Browne plays. The television is actually depicting the life he can never have, on one side, teenagers and youth are out having fun and partying, living like a youthful person should. On the other side, you have a very disturbed man who is loading up on guns and ammunition, isolating himself from people and attempting to for-fill his 'final mission.' Even Wizard, Travis' friend (Peter Boyle) states this when he talks to Bickle outside while they are at the diner. <br/><br/>The themes and undertones of this movie is what really makes it something special. Not many films at the time were about alienation, depression, mental illness and anti-heroes. This was one of the first and still holds an impact to this day. <br/><br/>The score by Bernard Herrmann captures the feeling and loneliness of New York City. In one part of the score, it has drums that build up suspense, almost like a horror film. Then all of a sudden, it transforms into a calm jazz song played by the saxophone. Variations of this one saxophone piece play throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Another cool feature I've noticed, whether intentional or not is during the credits. The camera switches to Travis' point of view as he drives around the streets of New York, looking at many of the interesting sites and buildings around the city. The same slow jazz song plays, it is all quite relaxing. Around halfway through the credits, the music suddenly changes into the suspense part of the piece. Travis then switches his viewpoint from the buildings to people. He is not fixed after the end, he can still descend into the spiral of madness he fought so hard to get out of. He is still alienated and he is still sick. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I award this masterpiece 10/10 Brilliant acting Brilliant themes / undertones Brilliant score Brilliant cinematography All in all, I memorable movie that stays with you long after first viewing."
"yilmazomar","10","1","2","19 December 2012"," Taxi Driver
","Robert Deniro committed to history, signed his name, in this film with his acting a masterpiece and nothing less. The way his character was so dreadfully lonely and isolated, and the way his anger and loneliness grew into what it did, and the way the cinematography and jazz music captured that loneliness in the city, of a single man amongst the crowds, the desolation and hunger amongst the people in the city and the people he encounters, the destitution and darkness it's all powerful. What's even more heartbreaking to me is the fact that Travis Buckle is a smart, optimistic warmhearted caring person full of humor and how that sort of shrivels away the longer he is in his environment. I love how his taxi becomes a ghost like figure. I also thought it was interesting how almost everyone was isolated or a depressing figure in some way, how most of the men especially in the film were lonely and how that loneliness effected all the women around them"
"JamesHitchcock","10","1","2","26 October 2012"," Spirit of the Age
","There are movies which seem to sum up the spirit of an age, and ""Taxi Driver"" is probably the one which best captures the spirit of America during the post-Vietnam and post-Watergate Ford administration of the mid-seventies. The main character, Travis Bickle, a New York taxi driver, is also a former U.S. Marine; the film never explicitly states that he served in Vietnam, but seventies audiences would probably have inferred this from the date of his honourable discharge (1973). <br/><br/>In the seventies New York was widely seen as a dirty, economically depressed, crime-ridden city, and this reflected in the film. Indeed, the state of America as a whole is little better. A Presidential candidate, Senator Charles Palantine, is campaigning in the city and, while he claims to offer a message of hope, his speeches paint a picture of a nation depressed by war, corruption, crime, unemployment and inflation.<br/><br/>Travis is a strange, contradictory character. Unable to adapt to civilian life, he suffers from insomnia and depression, and has few friends. Most of his spare time is spent writing in his diary or watching pornographic films. He meets an attractive young woman named Betsy, one of Palantine's campaign volunteers, and persuades her to go out with him, but she dumps him when he takes her to see a blue movie on their second date. Despite his liking for pornography, however, he is something of a moralist, disgusted by the petty crime, drug addiction and prostitution that he witnesses on his journeys and becomes obsessed with the idea of doing something to ""clean the city up"" or to make himself famous. His first thought is to assassinate Palantine, not out of any political motive- he has no interest in Palantine's policies or politics in general- but to get revenge on Betsy for dumping him. He abandons this idea, however, when he realises that the senator's bodyguards suspect him, and forms a plan to rescue Iris, a twelve-year- old prostitute, from her pimp and from her life of vice. <br/><br/>""The Godfather Part II"" had made Robert De Niro one of the most exciting film stars of the seventies. ""Taxi Driver"" was the second film in his long collaboration with Martin Scorsese (the first was ""Mean Streets""), and his spellbinding performance here is perhaps even better than ""Godfather II"". Travis is not the hero of the film- this is a film without heroes- but its anti-hero. He is, ironically, hailed as a hero after he succeeds in freeing Iris in a violent shootout, but he could easily have become an assassin, reviled as another Lee Harvey Oswald. And yet, De Niro enables us, if not to sympathise with him, at least to understand his frustrations and the dark psychological compulsions which drive him. He is a man who has served his country honourably, yet who seems to have been abandoned by that country on his return to civilian life.<br/><br/>The other remarkable performance in the film comes from Jodie Foster. Iris may be a victim, of her pimp and of the men who use her for sex, but in Foster's portrayal Iris is a girl desperately trying to pretend that she is not a victim, but rather a cool, sophisticated young woman capable of making her own moral choices. Foster was only 13, but here she gives a clear indication of the great actress she was to become in the late eighties and nineties. There are also good contributions from Harvey Keitel as the pimp and Cybill Shepherd as Betsy, a genteel middle-class girl who is first fascinated by Travis, then repelled by him. <br/><br/>De Niro was nominated for a ""Best Actor"" Oscar, but lost to another great performance, Peter Finch's in ""Network"". Bernard Herrmann should have won ""Best Musical Score"" for his melancholy, jazz-based music with its plangent saxophone which fits the film's mood perfectly. Like Finch's this would have been a posthumous Oscar, as this was Herrmann's last film score and he died shortly after completing it. In my view the film itself should have won the ""Best Picture"" award for 1976, but in the event it proved to be too controversial for the Academy, which often prefers the sentimental to the challenging. I could have understood ""Taxi Driver"" losing to something like ""Network"" or Don Siegel's ""The Shootist"", both excellent films in their own right, but losing to ""Rocky""..? <br/><br/>What really baffled me was that there was no ""Best Director"" nomination for Scorsese. Admittedly, he has never been a favourite of the Academy, but this is a superbly directed film. Scorsese is particularly skilled at finding memorable images, notably those of Travis's cab on its journeys through the steamy night-time city. (The film was shot during a summer heatwave). These scenes are dominated by images of dirt and corruption, contrasting with the tawdry glitter of the neon lights and images of water, in the form of rain, of sprays from the fire hydrants or what Roger Ebert described as ""stygian clouds of steam"". Another remarkably effective sequence is the final shoot-out in which Travis takes on Iris's pimp and his associates. The film may have influenced Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat"" from a few years later, another film set during a heatwave and which uses a jazz score reminiscent of Herrmann's. <br/><br/>The intelligent and literate script was written by Paul Schrader, later to become a director in his own right; a number of Schrader's other films, such as ""American Gigolo"" have a self-centred loner as their main character. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the greatest films of the seventies, one of those rare films where script, direction, photography, acting and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10"
"dume-officialinbox","10","1","2","21 October 2012"," Scorsese's Masterpiece
","This movie have everything, from great script and direction to great performances and edition. We all know, and for those who do not, that Martin Scorsese is an auteur type of director so that he introduces a little of his persona into the film so that we may find things like the music of rock n roll or jazz, plot in the streets or gangs in his movies, because of the life he lived on the streets plus his drug addition to those times. But anyways, talking about the film, Taxi Driver it's indeed a masterpiece. The main character is an unstable Vietnam veteran that uses to work at nights as a taxi driver and every night he encounters new situations with his passengers that even can lead to a murder of another person. This man hates the people that are prostitutes, murderers and all kind of low persons out in the street that he sees every night and he decides that if government don't eliminate people like that, he will get rid of them by himself but as time passes he meets this young girl who works as a prostitute and decides to help her get out from her misery.<br/><br/>In this movie we often hear the jazz music and see variations of camera angles, which it all describes the protagonist puzzled mind. It's really enjoyable to watch,one of the best performances by Robert De Niro. If you're a Scorsese or De Niro's fan this movie is for you, only because is a drama film doesn't mean you'll get bored, instead, you will grow more interested into Martin Scorsese films."
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","2","5 June 2012"," All the animals come out at night
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a perfect example of the sort of uncompromising movies that were released by the American studios in the era of New Hollywood in the 70's. It's very hard to imagine a major studio green lighting a film as transgressive as this nowadays. After all, the main character in Taxi Driver is Travis Bickle who is a racist sociopath. The other key character is a girl who is a twelve year old prostitute. These are not characters with the edges sanded down. They are deeply troubling and inhabit a world that is realistic enough to make you very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is an insomniac Vietnam veteran who enrols as a night time taxi driver in New York City. This is mid-70's New York though. It's a city quite at odds with the one we know now. Dirty and sleazy, these were very mean streets. Before Mayor Giuliani did what Travis wished for and cleaned the streets in the 90's, Manhattan was a very different proposition. Instead of Disney and Planet Hollywood, Times Square was a haven for XXX shows and porno cinemas. Travis wishes for a rain to wash the scum off these streets. He hates what he sees around him, made worse by the fact that he drives around these streets at night when 'all the animals come out'. His dilemma is made worse by the fact that he cannot connect with anyone. The film is as much as anything about the intense loneliness of being surrounded by people you cannot connect with. Travis is so disconnected from social norms that he takes a presidential campaign worker, Betsy, to a porn cinema for a first date. An encounter with an embittered fare leads to ideas of violence. The man, played by Scorsese himself, is a racist whose wife is having an affair with a black man. He declares he is going to kill him. Bickle simply listens and watches. It is only a matter of time before he takes his personal war to the streets.<br/><br/>This is a post-Watergate movie and like many other American films of the time it has a very cynical view of the U.S. political system. Going on in the background is an election campaign by a presidential candidate. At first Travis is all for this man but gradually becomes disillusioned leading him to an assassination attempt. This fails but it's not the main concern for this troubled man. His priority is saving a twelve year old girl from a life of prostitution. This leads him to arm himself to the teeth and blast his way into the lair of the gangsters blowing them away in a scene of extreme violence. The irony presented by the film is that it takes a psychotic madman to save this girl, as the authorities are entirely ineffective. I suppose we are supposed to question this act by Travis but I, for one, am fully behind him. The gangsters, who are essentially pimps and paedophiles, get no less than they deserve in my opinion. I think others must have agreed too, seeing as this film continues to connect with audiences on some level.<br/><br/>The direction from Scorsese is dynamic and visually bold. The world depicted is an entirely subjective one, where we see things as Travis sees them. Often this means that when we see black characters we sense his dislike simply in how the camera pans slowly over them. It's disturbing to be in the head of a racist character, but it would have been dishonest to have depicted things in any other way. It's definitely a very bold uncompromising move. Travis's disturbed mind is shown in other expressionistic ways by jump-cuts, unusual camera angles, slow motion, red lighting and Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, which alternates from dreamy saxophone to frighteningly intense music. Everything in the film – bar the very uncomfortable intimate scene with Sport and Iris – is from Travis's point-of-view. This is not picture postcard New York. There are no panoramic views, no tourist shots, and no famous landmarks. Everything is from the world that Travis inhabits. It's up close and grim. It's New York as a hell on Earth.<br/><br/>The dramatics are propelled by Robert De Niro's intense performance which is so famous that it's sometimes easy to forget just how good it actually is. He is ably supported by the rest of the cast, particularly Harvey Keitel as the genuinely repulsive pimp Sport and Jodie Foster in an extremely adult role as the young prostitute Iris.<br/><br/>It is entirely possible to interpret the ending in two ways; at face value or as Travis's dying dream. Both work, as there is a sense of unreality about the final few moments. I think the truth sort of lies in between, I think it is reality but a very subjective one; the reality of a madman. Throughout the film, the perspective of Travis has been shown to be a skewed one. His almost dream-like final encounter with Betsy is merely a further example of his damaged mind. After dropping her off, he seems normal. Or does he? Betsy is about to approach him but has second thoughts. He drives off and then suddenly glances aggressively in his rear view mirror. Something else has caught the eye of this troubled man. The darkness remains within."

","Indeed. He is the only one in his room, in this city, in this country, on this earth. Indeed, nobody was talking to him. Taxi driver is not a psycho or maniac, he is neither a radical nonconformist nor a disappointed downer. Just another one. Because of what? War? Could be. Or, maybe, because of his primordial another being ? On these kinds of questions is hard to answer. Psycho? But only in the estimation of the public which gave him no choice how to be. This man only reflects society's sickness and moral turpitude. Furthermore, he is a creation of society's rejection, indifference, emptiness. Travis tried to be like everybody (not to follow the crowd): without self-analysis and mentioning on bad things, indulging in an affair with a woman. Tried but failed. I think the last action he did hadn't pushed on him for his further violent actions but only confirmed his inability to be like others because of his loner and idealist being. This movie shows us two sided problem: on one side is society which cannot accept another individuality, on the other is individuality which cannot join society. And then, the only way to be is to be own self, to have own purpose. ""Taxi driver"" is an essay to look at the unsolved problem by existential attitude."

","The film was released when the darkness of our culture began creeping into the theater. Movies were more raw, authentic and made a huge impact on audiences. Many of them made strong cultural and political statements. More young filmmakers were stepping out of traditional techniques and adding their own unique, artistic vision of style. Among these was Martin Scorsese, who has now become one of the most powerful directors of all time. And his successful career took off in 1976 with the release of a masterpiece... Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>This is a near perfect film, held together by intriguing story, brilliant direction, and perfect acting. Shot almost like a documentary, the film is entirely in the main characters perspective. With Paul Schrader's structure, every line has a meaning, every shot has a purpose, all adding to the story. The almost dreamlike sequences make you question whether or not what you are seeing is really happening. This film will make you realize the impact the vision of a great director can have on a film. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro gives one of the most realistic, most haunting performances in film history. The character of Travis Bickle was portrayed with such subtle authenticity. He fully inherited the character, mentally and physically altering himself for the role. He didn't have to act... he was Travis Bickle. He adds so much to the character that makes this movie unforgettable. His famous quirky monologues add a touch of humor to the film, but are also quite disturbing and effective. There's a reason Robert De Niro is dubbed as one of the greatest actors of all time, and his performance in Taxi Driver is that reason.<br/><br/>This film may not be for everyone. Many viewers may find it hard to relate to the character of Travis Bickle. He is the ultimate antihero. But if you like like well made, character driven films, this is a classic that is just as strong today, if not stronger, than it was when it was released in 1976. I highly recommend this film."
"mazec666","10","1","2","14 May 2012"," ""Are you talking' to me?""
","An intense performance from Robert De Niro, the passionate, ingenious direction of Martin Scorsese and the philosophical, crisp screenplay by Paul Schrader blend together to create a modern masterpiece of American cinemaTAXI DRIVER.<br/><br/>De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a lonely Vietnam veteran who takes the graveyard profession of driving cabs around the nasty streets of New York. Driven by painkillers and insomnia, Bickle's psyche deteriorates into a state of violence by isolation and desperation. In seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, Bickle sees not one but two different women: a gorgeous campaign worker (played by a flawless Cybill Shepherd) and a runaway teenage prostitute (played by a surprising Jodie Foster).<br/><br/>With Schrader's excellent script at their disposal, De Niro gives one of his most expressive performances ever committed to the history of celluloid. Scorsese's power of direction is on full display with his stunning camera-work and inspired editing techniques. The legendary composer Bernard Herrmann's jazzy score without doubt ranks as among the finest of his career. As being the final film he composed, Herrmann knew that if he was literally going out with a bang he really did.<br/><br/>Everybody already knows about Travis' ""Are you talking' to me?"" scene as being the best moment of the movie but I really disagree. My favorite moment of TAXI DRIVER is the scene where Travis, clutching a Magnum in his hand, watches American Bandstand while Jackson Browne's ""Late for the Sky"" is playing in the background. It is a remarkable scene to watch because of the contradicting irony in his state of mind.<br/><br/>TAXI DRIVER is probably my favorite Martin Scorsese movie of all time no question about it."

","A striking film. I didn't see this film until last night, more than 25 years after it was made. Generally I don't like the Scorsese/Tarantino adulation of gangster psychopathology, if only because it explains little and probably serves best to give timid males some relief from their anxieties. If their films point a moral, it is that people do what has been done unto them, which is a pretty obvious truism that doesn't require slaughter-house emphasis.<br/><br/>But what makes this particular film so disturbing? Surprisingly, I think it is the music, the whole lounge jazz idiom. Some call Taxi Driver a film noir. It is not - it's way too seedy. But it has the score of a film noir. In other words, Taxi Driver is a forties/fifties film set in the seventies. Strictly, the score should include bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd, but not the Stones (too hedonistic), but more likely urban rock like Springsteen (for the self-pity). It would have made a more informative film: for instance, how afraid of himself is this character? <br/><br/>In a way, Scorsese is here like Bogdanovich and Polanski, cultural outsiders making stylistic tributes to a more authentic cinematic tradition. Only the likes of Dick Richards' Farewell My Lovely really worked, but they were still in that tradition.<br/><br/>The great surprise for me in Taxi Driver is the relative humanity of de Niro, the control freak who hadn't at that stage quite got himself under control. At times, he even reminded me of the more witty Bruce Willis."

","I thought this was an action movie at first but I quickly got over that and knew where the movie was going. It was easy to say it was a good movie.<br/><br/>The way the cast played their roles was enough to understand what was going on without having to show it through dialogue. The conversations within the film are interesting rather than something to bear with. Some of them are funny and silly while some are ponderous and insightful.<br/><br/>Maybe the only character driven film I completely enjoyed, not to mention relate to. Every character and scene is important in motivating DeNiro's decisions and subsequent actions. Having seen it, I have to say it's an important film that depicts one's isolation and it's dangerous effects. It's something to think about."

"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","1","2","6 May 2009"," A chilling portrait of society that is forever haunting and true.
","The beginning of the 1970s saw the rise of New Hollywood, an American film-making movement that changed movie-making forever with its searing honesty and hard-hitting realism. Classics like Chinatown, Network and The Godfather toppled cinematic taboos by presenting the movie-going public with radically gritty and audacious stories of the darker side of society and human nature. In my opinion the most powerful and effective film to come from this influential movement is 1976's Taxi Driver, a timeless masterwork from the great Martin Scorsese, who takes no prisoners in telling the story of a disenfranchised soul on the tattered fringe of society, and he drags you shocked but mesmerized to the very end.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro in perhaps his most famous role) is a lonely and mentally disturbed Vietnam veteran who doesn't feel welcome anywhere in his community, New York City. Suffering from insomnia (probably due to his experiences in Vietnam) he spends most nights taking drugs and hiding out in porno theatres waiting for the day to come when someone will give him the time of day. After awhile he decides to take a job as a taxi driver around NYC, and through this line of work he witnesses the full extent of urban malaise in New York. Sickened by this, Travis decides to set out to try and clean up the city for good using no-holds-barred violence. In the meantime, he tries to forge a relationship with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a stunning campaign aid for presidential candidate Charles Pallantine, but he fails miserably and naturally this increases his frustration and anger. He makes an assassination attempt on Pallantine's life, but fails in this act also. Finally he redeems himself when he saves the life of an underage prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster, turning in one of the most professional child performances in cinematic history) from her abusive pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is nothing short of a force of nature in the lead role. After having famously worked as a cab driver for months to prepare for the part, he effortlessly creates a scarred man beyond help who sees no harm in trying to clean up the streets through acts of violence. This is an unmistakably scary performance; there are no traces of Robert De Niro here. Jodie Foster, who has become one of the very few famous child actors to become a highly respected adult performer, gives a turn far beyond her years at the time, flawlessly downplaying Iris' outward self-confidence and inward vulnerability (which is exactly how many 14-year-old girls AND boys are even now), Cybill Shepherd brings sophistication and grace to the career-driven blonde bombshell Betsy, and Peter Boyle is perfectly cast as Wizard, the streetwise guy who Travis turns to for advice. For better or worse these are all types you could find in just about any street, and De Niro, Foster, Shepherd and Boyle breathe life into them with absolute accuracy.<br/><br/>Working from Paul Schrader's uncompromising screenplay (Schrader used Arthur Bremer as the inspiration for Travis), Martin Scorsese achieves his most accomplished directorial achievement after Raging Bull. He was perhaps the ideal director to tell this story, having been raised on crime films whilst grown up in New York's Little Italy, and he pulls no punches (keep an eye out for him in a cameo appearance as a guy in Travis' cab going home to kill his unfaithful wife). Scorsese summons all the tools and elements of film-making to bring to the table a ferocious portrait of America reduced nearly to the status of a cruel and dark wasteland that sucks people in and crushes all their hopes and dreams: most notably, the editing is fluid, the cinematography is grainy as it should be and never too intrusive, and Bernard Herrmann's jazzy and evocative score is instantly recognizable.<br/><br/>With this landmark film that changed the cinematic landscape forever, Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro all worked to make a social statement that is still so true and shocking, but one you simply can't look away from no matter how harder it may be to stomach. As (possibly, depending on whether you view Travis as a villain or as just as a really deranged antihero) troubling as it may be there have always been many Travis Bickles all over the world, and that's where Taxi Driver's timeless and universal truth lies."
"collierja","10","1","2","16 April 2009"," Martin Scorsese's best film, and the best film of motion picture history
","Taxi Driver is easily my favourite film of all time. Why? It's simple. Robert Di Nero plays a Vietnam veteran named Travis Bickle, who is emotionally unstable, socially inept, depressed and lonely. He suffers from insomnia and decides to become a taxi driver, working at night shifts from (and I quote) '8 in the evening to 6 in the morning, sometimes 8 in the morning. I work 6 days a week, sometimes 7 days a week. It's a real hassle but at least it keeps me busy.'<br/><br/>I'm not gonna give away any major plot details about Taxi Driver; it's a film everyone should see with no spoilers. It didn't grab my attention at first, but I was blown away after seeing it through to the end. I think it's the most important, powerful film of the 1970s, if not, motion picture history. As an only-child and insecure teenager, I often feel incredibly unstable and lonely, so I can really empathise with the character's isolation and descent into madness and alienation. I guess another thing that makes me tick about this film is the superb acting by Robert Di Nero. Before I saw the film, the only knew him from Meet the Parents, in which I perceived Di Nero as a strict, yet well respected, cool, wealthy, 'winner' type guy; a real catch. Watching him play a violent, unlikable, menacing loner who later gets a mo-hawk, in 1970s X-rated Taxi Driver, however, cranks me up, so as you can imagine, I am in awe of the actor's amazing versatility.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a timeless work of art; a masterpiece. I haven't seen a film depicting mental illness as well as this. I first saw it last year and it hasn't dated one bit, unlike Scorsese's other work such Mean Streets and Raging Bull. It's full of chilling moments, and Robert Di Nero does a flawless, monotonous narration, fuelled with quotes I will never forget such as 'by the time I finish my shift, I wipe the c** off the back seat. Sometimes, I wipe off the blood.' and (talking to his passenger President Palatine 'I think it's time we moved on flushed it down the f***ing toilet.' (I am aware that my quotes are not entirely accurate). There are no other films that have provoked me as well as this, and I doubt there ever will be.<br/><br/>Classic! 10 out of 10"
"jdiazcuesta","8","1","2","31 March 2009"," Take a trip with Travis
","Don Quixote got crazy after too much reading and too little sleeping...<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese takes us on a trip around New York City in a yellow cab driven by Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a Vietnam veteran who, due to his lack of sleep, decides to work also during the night. He falls in love with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker with whom he shall attempt to go out. But the world Betsy and the presidential candidate she works for live in does not coincide with the one Travis sees from his taxi every night: that other world, shown to us through Travis's eyes and through the eyes of the taxi he drives, is one inhabited by people like Iris (Jodie Foster), a too-young prostitute whom he will try to rescue from her ponce 'Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel).<br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' is not a film about the night in the big city, in spite of its showing the apparently hidden reality that remains behind the curtains of neon and light. We follow Travis on his working trips and also during his resting time, when he finds entertainment seeing pornographic films. 'Taxi Driver' is about someone who cannot confront reality.<br/><br/>Night-shift taxi drivers and prostitutes: two figures that maintain a close and strong relationship all over the world. Business-like, for sure, although Travis does not know what to do with the money he gets from Sport. In fact, Travis spends a lot of money on buying an arsenal, and a great deal of time on body building.<br/><br/>It is not difficult to think of Travis as a mentally ill person. What is really difficult is to allow the spectator to understand how a mind can go through the downhill process of mental catastrophe, and yet that mind be desperately seeking relieve. What rather than who drives that taxi? Is it only the consequence of the Vietnam experience? Is it disgust, racism, or a pitiful feeling of not belonging to anyone, of not being loved by anyone? The frequent nocturnal sequences of the film acquire a nightmarish dimension not only by means of the appearance of the prototypical smog of New York City but also by the use of subjective and over-the-shoulder shots of both the driver and his taxi. ""The job becomes the man,"" says one of his work mates, the only Sancho Panza he meets. Travis, travel, taxi, taxi driver: the name becomes the title, the title becomes the film.<br/><br/>The seminal work of John Ford in 'The Searchers' and 'Fort Apache', for instance, with both John Wayne in the former film and Henry Fonda in the latter performing functional roles not too dissimilar from the one represented by De Niro in this film, shows us heroes(?) who may seem necessary to many but with whom few people would like to live. The main difference between Ford and Scorsese does not lie in the place, neither in the genre'Taxi Driver' can be plainly read as a late western, with the people of the night as the Native Americans, as the others, nor in the historical moment they date their stories, but in the state the spectator is left in by each director. Ford leaves us wondering about the reason-ability of his main characters, Scorsese lets us enter the mind of Travis as the privileged passengers who will never forget the experience of having taken a trip with Travis. Perhaps we shall not want to remember that we have been in that taxi. Perhaps we may prefer to think that it was only a dream, only a film.<br/><br/>José Díaz-Cuesta"

","This movie is absolutely perfect in every way. I'm actually only 16 years old and it's incredibly easy for me to like it. Even after 32 years ""Taxi Driver"" is still an engrossing watchable masterpiece from start to finish. Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster and Cybill Shepard give the performances of their careers and Marty Scorsese does an excellent job behind the camera to help symbolize the main characters isolation such as the phone conversation scene between Bickle and Betsy you notice that the camera suddenly drifts away from Bickle and shows something else but you still hear him talking. And that's what this movie's about, it's about how isolation can affect one's sanity, actions and their own perspective on things. Such as Travis' beliefs that everyone around is dirty, corrupted and weak and he isn't, he thinks he's God's only good guy and he thinks he's the only one who can clean it up, like he's the savior or something. Like I said, this guy is NUTS, completely out of his mind, and during the shootout scene at the end that's when he finally loses it. But you'll still find yourself rooting for him and hope he'll lose his loneliness and find someone.<br/><br/>During the first half of the movie Travis starts to date the woman Betsy which represents his attempt to break free from his solitary life and he fails miserably, showing that no matter how hard he tries he can't connect with anyone. And the second half, he focuses on saving the teenage prostitute ""Easy"" Iris, and that represents how he thinks he can change the world, but at the ending scene he realizes there is STILL corruption going on in the streets of New York. Meaning he fails so badly at both of his personal missions in here and that's what makes ""Taxi Driver"" a depressing, depressing movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay and the directing is terrific and I'm surprised ""Taxi Driver"" didn't get a nomination at the Oscars for either of these. Screenplay's great 'cause of all the regular conversations normal people have that take place in here and the memorable ""You talking' to Me?"" scene. And this movie showed what kind of a genius Martin Scorsese is when it comes to making movies, it's too bad he didn't win an Oscar until 30 years later for The Departed.<br/><br/>I recommend this for everyone and anyone. You won't be disappointed."

The film has something that very few films can ever achieve and that is making the audience feel the world Travis Bickle lives in. You can sense the smell of the city air, be dazed by the city's lights, and be torn apart by the loneliness of every cold and crowded street. You can feel Bickle's sickness with all the pimps and low lives who are able to obtain woman, while he struggles with them in all his efforts. Travis realizes that his life has been lead in one direction that will let him make his imprint on the world before his sad and inevitable end.

"Robert_duder","9","1","2","21 April 2008"," A depressing and captivating look at the underbelly of the world
","I wasn't sure how I would take to Taxi Driver. I have come to love Robert Deniro as an actor, and I've always been kind of indifferent towards the iconic Martin Scorsese although I have not seen a lot of his stuff...some of it I hated and some of it I respected. Plus Taxi Driver is no doubt a cinema classic and I needed to see it. It started out a little slow and I was beginning to think that this would be another over rated classic and then the magic of Taxi Driver started to work. It's the kind of film that is really stealthy because it starts to grow on you and really sucks you into the dark and disturbing world. The film really depressing and dark and the story really has a haunting tone and it slowly starts to really move you and suck you into the world of this depressed, insomniac loner who is basically having a quarter life crisis. He's late twenties, feels like he has no direction, can't sleep, is not well educated, angry, and wants to make a difference in the world. He has no social skills to speak of and really has this passion to change someone no matter what. Really the film lies in the hands of the taxi driver and the actor that portrays him and that is quite simply what made the film and the actor famous forever.<br/><br/>Robert Deniro stars as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who fits everything I just explained above but you need to see his performance to understand. This film is of course the original source for Deniro's infamous ""...you talking to me?"" Bickle is just a character full of empathy and you can't help but feel for him and really get drawn into his slightly twisted mind. He has such depth and emotion to his character, some more subtle than others. He is brilliant and this is almost a one man show on his part as he drives his cab from situation to situation. Cybill Shepherd is okay in a fairly small role as the object of Deniro's rather twisted fascination. The two of them clash and it adds something to Deniro's story but she doesn't really impress. A very young Jodie Foster post Disney movies plays an underage hooker of all things and she gets a lot of acclaim for this movie and I think it is credited as hoisting her out of child actor and into the role of adult actor. I think she is a little over credited for the role because it's quite small BUT she is excellent in it. Her role is also very dark and disturbing and her and Deniro have great chemistry. Harvey Keitel is terrific in a small role as well, as Foster's pimp and disturbing love interest 'Sport.' Also watch for great supporting roles by Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how dark this movie is. I mean in a way it's like there is this ray of light throughout the whole film and remarkably after everything that happens the film gets a happy ending?! I never saw that coming at all and it made the film even better. The last five or ten minutes of the film is an absolute blood bath like Scorsese likes to do but everything fits together and it just happens to work like magic. It might be the most depressing film I've ever seen and yet everything works out which makes it truly a feel good film in many ways. There is so much to ask yourself when the credits role and there is no doubt in my mind why this film has become timeless because it could be watched again and again just to get a feel for the character and everything involved. I can't recommend this enough for anyone who wants a truly intelligent, deeply moving film. You can't be disappointed with it. 9/10 (Probably should be a 10/10 but after a few more views perhaps?)"
"hnt_dnl","10","1","2","25 March 2008"," A certified masterpiece of American cinema
","As highly regarded as Raging Bull is, I truly think that TAXI DRIVER is the greatest collaboration between Martin Scorcese and Robert DeNiro. There's just something raw, pure, and real about this film that gets to the core of humanity. A highly controversial film to this day, Taxi Driver packs a 100% emotional punch. Personally, this film makes my top 10 films of all time. It just has to b/c I can't imagine a top 10 w/o Scorcese and I believe this to be his greatest work.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro in one of probably the 5 greatest film performances in history) is a workaholic, world-weary, insomniac, (slightly) deranged Vietnam war veteran who now drives cabs for a living in New York City, circa 1976, the year the film came out in theaters. Bickle sees the world through jaded eyes, mind, heart, body, and soul. Scorcese literally takes the viewer into Bickle's mind by using his actual thoughts to narrate the film. Through thoughts and looks, it appears that Travis is frustrated, angry, suspicious, lonely, and perhaps even racist. DeNiro masterfully conveys all these emotions and characteristics throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film has 2 femme fatales: A politician's aide (played by an utterly fascinating and desirable blonde bombshell Cybill Shepherd) and a 12-year old prostitute (played by Jodie Foster in a performance that established this young actress as a major talent). As odd as it appears at first, you really understand what Bickle sees in these 2 females. They provide him with qualities that he otherwise doesn't possess. Shepherd makes him think that he could have a normal relationship with a woman and Foster taps into his paternal instincts. It's almost like he has an adopted family with these 2 females. Ironically, or not so much, these 2 'relationships' occur exclusive to each other b/c Bickle has real trouble connecting or staying connected to anyone for too long b/c of his not-so-great social skills. A lot of the 'conversations' and interactions that he has w/ these 2 women and other characters end up as incomplete or muddled, but this is the point: to illustrate that this man is himself an incomplete human being who desperately needs something or someone to make him believe in humanity and that he has a place in this world.<br/><br/>There are quite a few minor characters in the film that only add to its humanity and brilliance: Albert Brooks as Shepherd's humorous political co-worker, Peter Boyle as Travis' fellow cab driver who he has a rather touching conversation w/ outside a café where the cabbies hang out, Harvey Keitel as Foster's 'Indian' pimp, and Mr. Martin Scorcese himself as one of Travis' fares, an angry husband who wants to commit a heinous act and relays all of it to Travis.<br/><br/>DeNiro's character appears to spiral out of control as the film progresses and there are points it looks like he's going to literally explode before our very eyes. Then something will happen to reign it all in. The climax of the film is one of the most disturbing moments in all of film history. I won't spoil it, but it is violent, scary, gory, sad, and heartbreaking. And it is all b/c of Travis Bickle. You literally have become so involved w/ this man throughout the film that you feel his loneliness, bitterness, and pain in the end and knew it had to culminate to this. The real ending may surprise some, but it doesn't take away from the humanistic mastery of this film and of DeNiro's legendary performance.<br/><br/>Scorcese has long said that Taxi Driver was inspired by the John Ford/John Wayne collaborative masterwork The Searchers. And I totally believe it b/c I've seen both films many times and understand the comparisons: A roaming, lonely, jaded, racist antihero 'searching' for something/someone in a dangerous, cruel, me-first world and doing this for mysterious reasons that is never really understood w/ a cast of memorable supporting characters to round out the action and the film. And as much as it is influenced by The Searchers, I still stand Taxi Driver out alone as influential in its own right.<br/><br/>MASTERPIECE! CLASSIC! SUPERLATIVE! All of that."

I could relate to him in so many ways it was almost scary. Im not saying we're the SAME but similar in many ways. This isn't a movie for the type who only like modern movies with ""200% action"". They have no soul. This movie HAS soul. This is a film for true movie fans. Robert DeNiro was great, but so were the others. Cybill Shepherd gave quite a performance as DeNiro's ""5-minute flame"" Betsy. Jody Foster actually played very well as the 12-year old prostitute Iris Steensma. Peter Boyle was very well cast as Bickle's cabby friend Wizard. Even Harvey Keitel shows a good performance as Iris' pimp, Matthew aka ""Sport"". I love this movie, and it will always be a classic to me. 10/10"

","A perfect film.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese displays complete mastery over his medium in this deeply disturbing 1976 masterpiece, and to my mind hasn't yet made another movie as good as this one (no, not even ""Raging Bull"").<br/><br/>In ""Taxi Driver,"" Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who drives a cab for a living. Isolated and lonely, Travis prowls the hellish streets of New York's worst neighborhoods, willing to drive customers anywhere they want to go, quietly nurturing vague fantasies of vengeance on what he perceives to be a sick culture. The whole movie is a nightmarish fever dream. I've never seen anyone capture visually what on the page would be stream of consciousness narration as well as Scorsese does here. And De Niro gives the performance of his, or anybody else's, career. His Travis is a fascinating creation, and one of the most frightening screen characters in the history of cinema. No one could keep me up nights quite like the seemingly ordinary Joe who's ready to snap at any moment and feels that his grisly duty is handed down to him from on high.<br/><br/>Cybill Shepherd plays Travis's nominal love interest with just the right amount of vapidity, and Jodie Foster, in a small, sweet and wonderful performance, plays Iris, the thirteen-year-old prostitute who becomes the object Travis sets out to save from the rotten world that has turned him into what he is. And the late Peter Boyle has a couple of beautiful moments as Travis's fellow cab driver, who tries to give him some counsel but is so obviously out of his league.<br/><br/>Shortly after ""Taxi Driver"" hit screens, Vietnam turned into a subject that film makers felt comfortable addressing directly (""Coming Home,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The Deer Hunter""). But none of these, though so much more actually ABOUT Vietnam, addressed half as well as ""Taxi Driver"" the toll that that conflict took on the men it sent back home.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"Lord_Crypto","10","1","2","12 July 2007"," A Dark Film that is a Masterpiece
","Taxi Driver is an absolutely stunning film. One of Martin Scorsese's original masterpieces that was nominated for best picture in 1977. This film is absolutely amazing in that nothing is wrong with it. It has wonderful acting, direction, writing (screenplay), and filming.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with this film. The filming is absolutely phenomenal, some of the best filming I have ever seen. The dark and horrible images of New York City are captured beautifully on camera. The footage taken from the Taxi Cab is brilliant, giving us the feeling we are driving that cab. The viewer gets the feeling that they are seeing and even feeling everything that is happening. Absolutely brilliant camera work! The story is brilliant. It focuses around the actions of a disturbed individual (Robert De Niro) who drives a Taxi cab during the most dismal times in New York City. The result, is an increasingly growing anger for all the filth and scum that he sees around him living in the city.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro portrays a psychotic and isolated Taxi Driver named Travis Bickle who is a Vietnam veteran. This is, in my opinion, De Niro's best performance in a film. His character is extremely unstable and his portrayal of the anger, hatred, and cockiness in his character is phenomenal. The intensity he has on screen is unmatched by only a handful of performances I can think of. This is Robert De Niro at his best. Jodie Foster plays an extremely convincing young girl who Bickle tries to save from the scum of the city. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle deliver wonderful roles as well as Harvey Keitel, who plays the pimp named ""Sport"" who you just love to hate.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is brilliant. I did not see it coming and it actually made me feel good. There are plenty of different interpretations about the ending and hopefully you can come to one you agree with after you see it.<br/><br/>The film is so great in that little things make it amazing. One example, is the way Robert De Niro delivers his lines. They come out so smooth and invigorating that you are left captivated by him. Not just his lines, but other quotes from the film that leave you shocked or laughing. Another example, is simple actions performed by the characters. De Niro is not just amazing in how he talks, but also his actions. Small things like when Bickle smiles or smirks and when he points his finger to his head and starts to make gun shot noises is incredible. And the background music at that point is amazing. It really adds to the intensity of the scene.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. I truly believe this film beats out Raging Bull as De Niro's best performance. A must see film that has remained one of the most brutal and cinematic masterpieces of all time."
"ExpendableMan","9","1","2","20 February 2007"," A tale of masculine loneliness and one of the greatest films of the seventies
","Taxi Driver is one of those films that a lot of people will be able to relate to. That might sound a bit melodramatic given that it culminates in the main character losing all control, trying to assassinate a senator and then shooting up a whore house, but it's true. Okay, maybe not completely true as its hardly likely that everyone who has ever felt a tad isolated is going to turn into a gun totting lunatic, but nevertheless, Taxi Driver will be a familiar story for any man who has ever felt serious disillusionment about life and a growing sense that something is terribly wrong, but are unable or unwilling to do anything about it. God's lonely men are everywhere, this film is their voice.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle is a revelation. The Greatest Method Actor Of All Time handles his subject with aplomb, turning Travis into a very believable and troubled man. He is a sad, lonely individual who is also kind of creepy, but nonetheless he is a recognisable and even quite sympathetic one, De Niro all nervous smiles and delirious ranting. When he sits in a café with his fellow taxi drivers for instance, focusing on a set of painkillers fizzing away in a glass of water, the conversation drifting past him and staring into the water's healing potential, his position becomes all too clear - this is a man with nowhere to go, nobody to turn to and who blames the ills of society on his own self loathing.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is a very keen sense of urban paranoia running through. Surrounded by the seedy underbelly of New York city, Travis is faced with violence and sexual depravity every single day. And this turns into guilt on his part too - when a young prostitute barrels into his cab, pleading for help only to be snatched away by her pimp who leaves a crumpled bank note on the seat as thanks, its easy to see Travis's shame catching up with him. Soon, he is ranting about ""cleaning up the mess"" and ultimately becomes a vigilante, his disturbed mind resorting to simple, base aggression as he lashes out at the evil around him, trying to atone for his own sins.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it is undeniably De Niro's film. Only two scenes focus on people other than Travis but even so, the support actors do a terrific job breathing life into their characters. The then thirteen year old Jodie Foster in particular displays incredible skill and maturity for her age, her depiction of Iris a jumbled mixture of cynical world weariness and teenage naivety. Harvey Keitel meanwhile has never been more sleazy than as 'Sport,' her pimp, a strutting, cocksure and thoroughly detestable scumball. You can't wait for Travis to take his new .34 Magnum to him, but this of course is where things get nasty.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver you see is not afraid to show just how ugly violence is. Here, gun battles are gritty, dark and altogether real. Bullets tear holes in stomachs, blow hands apart and rip a man's face into a bloodied ruin, Scorsese may have been criticised for championing violence but such a criticism never really paid enough attention. When the blood flows as freely and bodies reduced to wreckage this easily, you find yourself revolted at the effects of Travis's rampage, despite yearning for it earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>In short then, a dark classic and one of the best American movies of all time. Too much has been written on it for me to add anything extra but in terms of addressing masculine loneliness that like as not, strikes all of us at some point, nothing else comes close."

","~THIS CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS, BUT EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YET, I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD RUIN IT TOO MUCH. JUST WARNING YOU OUT OF CONSIDERATION~ I'm a huge fan of movies. I love them. I watch heaps. And Taxi Driver is one of the best. I'm gonna go buy the DVD when I get around to it.<br/><br/>The film follows Travis Bickle in his job as a Taxi Driver (As the title suggests). Travis cannot sleep, so he works night shift. As he caters night after night to low-lives of all kinds, he feels hatred towards them, and regards them as being worthless.<br/><br/>When he encounters a child prostitute, Iris, he becomes obsessed with her, wanting to save her from the dangerous life she is leading. This is perhaps where the best of Travis can be seen; He means well, but doesn't necessarily do well.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin the movie, so I will stop there. To anyone who hasn't seen this movie, I strongly recommend it. Robert DeNiro is a brilliant actor, and Jodie Foster's acting is a cut above average. All around good acting, and a brilliant plot. Scorcese is a genius director."
"jzappa","10","1","2","5 November 2006"," A Truly Mysterious Noir
","This truly mysterious film is not about a city but about the endurance of Travis' soul, and out of all New York he pegs only those details that sustain and bolster his fixations. He is an ex- Marine, Vietnam vet, composer of conscientious anniversary letters to his parents, taxi driver, killer. The movie seldom digresses terribly far off from the exclusive, deeply abstract manner in which he views the city and lets it traumatize him.<br/><br/>It's a place, first of all, occupied by women he cannot have: unapproachable blonde women who might find him attractive for a second, who might join him for coffee, but who ultimately will have to shake their heads and sigh, ""Oh, Travis!"" because they find him odd. And then, even more inhumanly, the city seems colonized by men who can have these women, men ranging from clowning political hacks to street-corner pimps who, all the same, have in common the mystical aptitude to address a woman without getting everything wrong.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is an old-fashioned romantic at heart, but he settles for the lowest common denominator of diversion when he can't sleep because of how small his sociopathic mind is. He follows no political issues, music, movies, not much except his job. He could on paper look for fares anywhere in the city, but he's invariably carried back to 42nd Street, to Times Square and the whores, street freaks, and porno houses. It's here that an ugly kind of sex comes closest to the external, the sex of buying, selling, and using people. Travis isn't into that, he hates it, but Times Square nurtures his rage. His sexual frustration is focalized into a loathing for the dregs he consumingly scrutinizes. He tries to violate the repetition. <br/><br/>There is a masterfully melancholy scene so painful that camera pans away into a doorway. It's as if we can't stand to watch Travis feel the grief of being rejected. This is fascinating, because later, when Travis goes on a murder spree, the camera goes so far as to assume slow motion so we can see every nuance of the violence. <br/><br/>That Scorsese finds the rejection more disturbing than the murders is compelling, because it helps to clarify Travis Bickle, and maybe it goes to some degree toward defining one variation of urban violence. Travis has been ostracized so methodically, so frequently, from a piece of the action that ultimately he has to hit back in some such way.<br/><br/>Scorsese's distinctive noir doesn't disclose more than a decent fraction of what we want to know, even through the narration of Travis himself keeping a diary, because his diary is given in present-tense. We're not told where Travis comes from, what his particular issues are, because this isn't an investigation, but a vignette of some days in his life. We don't know the niceties of Travis's abstractions, but in an eerie sense we know what we need to know of him. The film's a masterpiece of evocative character study. Scorsese's techniques sorts out fine points that suggest feelings, and that's the result he wants. The performances are both strange and realistic: He goes for moments from his actors, rather than slowly developed characters. It's as if the required emotions were written in the margins of their scripts: Give me anger, fear, dread. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro, as Travis Bickle, evokes despondency, agitation and passion while totally maintaining mystique, and in many of his close-ups, Scorsese employs slow motion virtually below the threshold of our consciousness to prolong the foreshadowing and manifestation. Cybill Shepherd, as the blonde beauty, is an iceberg languidly retreating into sympathy. And there's Jodie Foster, shockingly cast as a twelve-year-old prostitute whom Travis wants to ""save."" Harvey Keitel, a veteran of Scorsese's earliest work, is the pimp who manipulates her, and he evokes the sure brand of severity that's all subterfuge.<br/><br/>These people are introduced essentially in very brief moments, like smoky shadows forebode to utterly eclipse them. This cinematic shard of steel, to which John Hinckley's subsequent actions were frankly a testament, is a hell, saturated in Bernard Herrmann's fluidly disillusioned score, from the opening shot of a cab emanating from dark, gloomy veils of apparent overcast to the climactic killing scene in which the camera ultimately looks straight down."

This is for many reasons, One is because of Scorsese, he is a living genius, just like Kubrick. Whether it's the screenplay he chooses, or the camera angles and sheer brilliance of how he portrays a character's emotions on screen. He is truly the master. Another is Mr. Robert DeNiro. Probabally the greatest actor of all time. His method acting is clearly present in this piece of groundbreaking film. It is one of the only films where I can say, ""I relate to this guy..."", after watching the film, you will know how crazy that sounds, to say ""I can relate to Travis Bickle."" This fantastic film entered the world in 1976. From that day forward, it will always be remembered as a classic, and one of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Rent it. Buy it. Love it."
"BlackVelvet88","10","1","2","26 July 2006"," A masterpiece
","This is one of those few films in which the word ""masterpiece"" can apply to. I read the screenplay and watched the film just last year and already it is my ultimate favorite. It's not just a landmark in filmdom, it's dark art that you can't help but marvel at. Martin Scorsese did a marvelous job. Ever since I watched this film, I completely idolized him.<br/><br/>You could say that it is one of a kind, or maybe first of a kind. It's not the typical drama, it's not a traditional film noir, nor an actual suspense, or even truly a crime drama. Yet it holds all those genres. It takes a bit of everything to create an existentialist themed genre of its own - it's the origin of its own kind.<br/><br/>About the plot, the situation in the beginning is quite simple but not bland. Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro) is a marine veteran who just came back from Vietnam and is dealing with insomnia. He takes the job as a cabbie to at least be doing something in the night, and eventually, that's what he becomes, an animal lurking in the dark. Other than his few cabbie friends, he grows lonely and finally gets a chance to have a real friendship with Betsy (Cybill Shephard), a campaign worker, but drives her away after taking her to a porn film. Once that happens, Travis becomes even more isolated and the mentality and restlessness of his mind starts and the intensity that makes this film a masterpiece begins. It ends with destruction and shots of the heroic turmoils of the great urban martyr. <br/><br/>It's a very hard film to understand. I admit, I was somewhat bewildered at the end, too, and I still am. Even so, I was left with great feeling for the film, that sense of shock mixed with awe and provocation. That's why I love this film - it makes you feel. If not enjoy or think like a movie is preferably ""supposed to have,"" everything about it makes you feel something, whether it be amusement, bewilderment, anger, or shock. The lighting, the transitions, the quotes, the movements - the brilliant parts, like the acting and the music - they all make you feel. It's like a contemporary film noir, only in color.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting, Jodie Foster did so well playing the presumptuous but not yet grown up hooker Iris. She didn't go for the stereotype, like even adult actors tend to do. She didn't just choose the dirty, street-toughened whore type as one would see prostitutes like. She played what she was - a little girl. She visualized the purity and special quality that makes her character stand out to Travis from the gutter city she lives in. She did so well in achieving this that she not only got nominated an Oscar, but also captured the interest of a real life madman. You can't go much further than that.<br/><br/>And of course, Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle. I may idolize Martin Scorsese, but I absolutely worship this actor. All those critical praises about his performance in this film: the brilliance, the realism, the depth - they're not even close. The name ""Travis Bickle,"" is like a second name for him because he portrays his nature so well. It fits with the isolationist mood of the film. It's so real that it seems like he's the only character there. Nobody can say ""You talking' to me,"" in a righter way. In my mind, he is not just the legendary actor Robert De Niro - he is Travis.<br/><br/>And the music is absolutely brilliant. The last works of Bernard Hermann (God bless him) have mixed moods. The main theme is soothing and jazzy but also deep and full of character and the other title theme is so chilling and ominous, though not in a horror or suspenseful way. It doesn't just add beauty to the film, it rises its character and flows with the plot. The movie simply would not be itself without the music.<br/><br/>Also starring Harvey Keitel as Iris's pimp and Leonard Harris as senator Charles Palantine, the film just flows like one great wave; small at first, then ascends greater and greater, until the big splash of rash destruction at the end."

"hudiefanny","9","1","2","17 July 2006"," Black elements in Taxi Driver
","Film noir has its own primary characteristics and conventions. For instance, most film noirs are shot in gloomy grays, blacks and whites. And the peak of production of film noir is from about 1945 to 1950. Taxi Driver, which was produced in the period of American Film Renaissance (1967-1976), was also one of film noirs because of the black elements in it. The film showed the dark and inhumane side of human nature cynicism and doomed love like all the traditional film noir. Travis fell in love with Betsy, who firstly appeared as an angel according to Travis. She found Travis attractive at first and was willing to go out some times with him, which was concluded as strange finally. There were all kinds of women in the society. But he could not have one, only because he was contradictive as Betsy described, though he had a clear-conscience. On the contrary, those who had not clear-conscience could have those women, such as dirty politicians and even pimps. It's the unfair and dark side of not only the human experience, but also the society. It's a world filled with entrapment, menace and squalid in which people were tend to go wrong and crazy. Usually, the protagonists in film noir were driven by their past or by human weakness to do something very wrong. In Taxi Driver, Travis came back from the army with no work, no friends, nothing, but a clear conscience, a sensitive heart and ability of action. The story was of urban night scenes and mostly took place in murky streets and dimly-lit buildings or hotel rooms. The director often took Travis's sight as the camera angle. When he observed the world from the front window of his taxi, the director of Taxi Driver used expressionistic lighting in making lots of disorienting and colorful sights to allude to the distorted world. And he also skillfully edited a succession of jarring scenes, like prostitutes, queens and fairies walking on the street, together as all kinds of epitomes of the dark society. Sometimes, narratives of a film noir would be made by the male protagonist as self-confession or backward look. Taxi Driver just changed the narratives into self-talk, diaries and letters, which, I think, also marked the movie as black. ""I go all over. I take people to the Bronx, Brooklyn, to Harlem. I don't care. Don't make no difference to me."" pointed out that Travis was lonely and alienated to the society by others or maybe by himself. Without any intention to join the sick and venal world, Travis wished that someday a real rain would come and wash all the scum off the street. It was the murky world and the failure of approaching other people that disappointed and despaired Travis and got him out of the belief for God. Travis bought four guns and decided to clear up the dirt of the world himself as he cleaned up the blood on the backseats of his taxi, which had been his expectation to the president candidate. When Travis used the gun at the first time to kill a robber in a convenient store, he was at loss about what to do now. The store keeper was very calm and told Travis that he could just leave and he would handle it himself. This detail revealed us a fact that this kind of robbery and killing was not fresh but happening all the time and all around in the city. <br/><br/>He wanted to be the never-coming God and tried his best to rescue and change the doomed destiny of the innocent prostitute, Iris, who was a comparison to Betsy. He did it, but still failed to be God. The red lights, showing all the time, symbolized that he would be stopped and dragged slow from time to time. After he killed Matthew and other baddies, everything went back to facial peace again very soon, as if nothing had really happened. He was and would never be a tragic hero. He was only a general taxi driver or even merely a pair of common eyes watching and witnessing what was happening in the world."
"Hogan227","10","1","2","11 July 2006"," Brilliant is too mild a word!
","This is my second favorite Scorsese film. Second only to Goodfellas, Taxi Driver will undoubtedly be one of the best movies you will ever see. The bloodbath is gruesome, sloppy, and real,unsurpassed by any film I have yet seen. The muted color in this scene makes the fulfillment of Travis's violent fantasies seem even more like a horrific nightmare than it already is. Travis himself is plagued by loneliness, and it eventually drives him mad, hence the bloodbath. The movie is a series of failed attempts to reach out and to find some significance in his life. De Niro's performance as Travis is chilling and unforgettable. The musical score sets a perfectly mellow tone for the movie. It's like the kind of music you would listen to on a rainy day. As I said in my summary, brilliant is too mild a word to describe this movie. Get this movie and watch it. Then watch it again. Then watch it ten more times. It's a masterwork of Martin Scorsese and I'd recommend it to everyone."
"ekisest","9","1","2","3 July 2006"," arguably DeNiro's second best screen performance
","In the seventies, Robert DeNiro was scoring one great performance after the other, under the direction of such masters as Coppola, Bertolucci, Kazan and, of course, Martin Scorsese. In ""Taxi Driver"" he achieves, in my opinion, his second best performance next to ""The Deer Hunter"". The whole film is about his character, really. This haunted taxi driver haunts the spooky streets of New York City every night, like a ghost summing up those tormented souls that ""came home"", from Vietnam. The camera captures the interior world of Travis - where the usual nocturnal ""fauna"" becomes a gallery of zombie-like, crawling creatures - while filming the surroundings in which the characters evolve. Scorsese superbly directs the young Jodie Foster and also, the beautiful Cybill Shepherd, whose performance was ignored by many critics raving about Foster. This atypical American film was awarded ""The Golden Palm"" at Cannes while Tennessee Williams was presiding the jury. The famous playwright must of found some truth in Scorsese's vision, right?"
"clementtuffreau","10","1","2","4 May 2006"," The CITIZEN KANE of the new generation
","TAXI DRIVER is probably the best movie ever made. Why ? Hell, I don't know. In the seventies, CITIZEN KANE was the absolute reference. If you check today, young directors all refer to TAXI DRIVER. It is the favorite movie of Lucky Mc Kee, Guillermo Del Toro, Quentin Tarantino. Everything is perfect in TAXI DRIVER : frames, lights, acting, music, and it has probably the best script ever written. No moral. No lesson. Just pure life, dry and harsh, with a series of cult scenes, from ultra-violence (the end) to pornography (the scene at the cinema), romance, folk music, social problems, populist politicians, racist things, solitude, hippies, family, etc. The all world is contained into Taxi Driver. I watch it once a month, and it reduces me to tears every time I see it. Every single scene is perfect. The all legend about the ""talking to me ?"" scene is quite easy to understand. The thing is, each time people mention it, they forget to tell it is not a macho scene, it is a very very sad scene, where De Niro, alone in flat, alone in his life says : ""who the hell are you talking to ? I'm the only here"". God. It touches you right to the heart. When De Niro, almost mute, can just say ""damn"" every time cause life has become impossible for him. Everything becomes an aggression to him : whites, blacks, politics, dirt, rain, drugs, prostitution, the world. Not only a movie about solitude : a movie about the world that contains multiple solitudes. The end refers directly to the supreme violence of Peckinpah's movies : blood is almost black, editing is quick and harsh, blam, blam, and you re see the entire story, so simple at the beginning, and you realize the entire script has been guiding you into hell, though you couldn't see it. No effects. Post Vietnam war. Dry. Super real. Travis Bickle, De Niro's character, is the entire humanity. His end might be yours. Damn."
"zaheenjamil","10","1","2","25 April 2006"," Its tooooo good
","HmmÂ… where to start with Taxi driver. For me it's a very personal film, a film I can relate to.I know to a lot of people who watch it end up idolizing Travis and think that it's all about the Mohawk or about the ""you looking at me"" line but for me it's like a million more things .<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film but I'm not looking for perfection. Yet with its imperfections, to me it couldn't be more authentic. I can relate to Travis on so many levels. The loneliness, the desire to clean up the city, trying to save Iris the list goes on. The acting is beyond phenomenal, I can't even fathom how you go about playing something like this.<br/><br/>First of all credit goes to the guy who wrote the script, Paul Schrader. He's like my hero. I mean the dialogues and the conversations, De Niro is beyond ridiculous and Jodie Foster is amazing especially for her age and Cybill Shepherd and ""Wizard"" Peter Boyle that guy is so fricking talented.<br/><br/>I mean that's acting you know. The first time I saw it I stumbled upon the movie accidentally while surfing channels a long time ago. I started half way through but it was such an engaging film that I just got caught up and years later I actually saw the whole film and I remembered why I wanted to see it so badly.<br/><br/>The way Travis is infatuated with Betsy and how he goes up to her and asks her out you know and also the conversation they have on their first date.That blows my mind. When Travis says, ""you know you have very beautiful eyes"" there isn't anything awkward, no sexual tension (to me anyway) and it was so honest you know. And how he says we had a connection and whether Betsy felt the same way and Betsy says, "" I wouldn't be here if I didn't"".<br/><br/>The conversation with Wizard and Travis just blows my mind you know when Travis's is like ""I got a lotta bad ideas"" I mean how did they do that! It looks to be totally improvised but I don't think it was. Also love the pie and coffee (I think).<br/><br/>Jodie Foster was incredible. She's just incredibly gifted and one of my favourite scenes is when they go out for breakfast. Jodie Foster is just phenomenal in that scene.<br/><br/>The music is perfect and it really accentuates the movie brilliantly. I can't even talk about this movie. It's just beyond incredible. I can't even believe that such a film exists. And I gotta say the ending when Travis gets shot and I immediately think oh know he's gonna die you know, its so sad. But to my delight, he's a hero the next day in the papers and then he drops Betsy off,to me right there, there was closure. I was a little confused at first with the ending but after reading more about the film I understand the ending now. I was really happy with it of course.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film probably write a book, which is why my review was more like some of the immediate thoughts I get when I think about this movie. It's a very rare film something that will never be duplicated and it's a gem really. I can understand why a lot of people don't ""get it"" and have all these questions. But I think its again one of those things you either love it or you don't. To me its one of the greatest films ever made and I'm very thankful for its existence."

","I really think this movie is a matter of perspective. Based on the ending, one could argue that this is not only a portrait of ""a man"", but more so - a serial killer to be. For example, little things that a normal person wouldn't be able to comprehend - taking a girl to a porno theater on the first date (LOL!), spending thousands of dollars on handguns, assuming protection of a 12 year old hooker...these are all psychological flaws that Travis cannot overcome! Something isn't right up there! And by the way - these things aren't so far removed from ""normal"" if you've lived in the Bronx, trust me. I'm not saying this as a knock, but NYC is about as honest as it gets.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly focused (or boring, depending on how you view it). I've seen it dozens of times and get something new out of it each time.<br/><br/>The ending is so interesting. People will say ""I can't believe he is celebrated as a hero!"" ...well, wake up and smell the coffee. There's countless Travis Bickles that aren't documented in film all around us.<br/><br/>It is not a celebration of violence at all. If anything, it is a critique of modern media and of American culture's 30 second attention span.<br/><br/>I really can't get into exactly why I like the film, I would be here all day. But it is among my favorites and certainly one of the best and most important films of all time."
"fleaaaaaa","10","1","2","30 November 2005"," The appeal of Taxi Driver
","Why does taxi driver have so much appeal? Well simply because there are so many Travis Bickle's in the world. I have to ask you a question, have you ever felt alone? Walked down a street full of strangers, realising there is no-one around that you know? I'm sure most people have felt that sometime, but Travis Bickle takes that to the most extreme degree, he feels like that all the time. The man who bring this character to life happens to be the rather obsessive, meticulous, method actor, that is Robert Deniro. Travis is such a complex character, miles away from most two dimensional Hollywood blockbuster heroes, for Robert Deniro to bring him to life, well to me makes him one of the greatest movie actors. He doesn't have a ""catchphrase"", he doesn't have friends, basically all he has is his job and his own loneliness. So basically I would say that Travis is the ultimate anti-hero.<br/><br/>I feel that anyone who has ever had a time in their life where they've spent a lot of alone time, maybe people who have simply seen a friend be like that, can relate. I think this is where the mass appeal lies. Another aspect is that Taxi Driver follows a real life murderer, he isn't portrayed as a monster though, just a misfit, who is a very real person.<br/><br/>Finally, the film just has a certain touch of class. Just the intro scenes made enough of an impact on me. That music and the visuals of the taxi. The speech at the beginning already confirming that Taxi Driver is going to be one of the darkest films you've ever seen (all the animals come out at night). It's brutally honest about New York (at the time), it doesn't paint some sort of false picture about it. It's all there, the drugs, the prostitutes, the porno theatre. How many other films dare talk about these things? Even now? But guess what, though I've never been to New York, I could show you all of these things if I went down to London. Most places have this side to them.<br/><br/>People understand this film. Whether they relate it to themselves or to someone they know, or simply find it interesting to watch Travis' descent until he finally cracks. The surroundings of a big city like New York, with a dirty underside, still relevant. All of these aspects, which I've discussed, make sure that the film is still watched and still relevant today. Sure it will be lost on some people who demand a much faster pace, people who are wondering when the killing will begin and even take joy in it when it does, but Taxi Driver is not supposed to be that film. It's a portrayal of emptiness, loneliness and alienation. People don't watch films like this, they become immersed in them.<br/><br/>So in short; Great acting, great music, great visuals, great script. Really, what else are you looking for in a film? Tell me, what?"
"JoshtheGiant","10","1","2","16 November 2005"," Maybe Best Film Ever
","Taxi Driver is one of the greatest and most powerful films ever made. It has several famous shots including one where the camera pulls away from Travis being dumped by his girlfriend and looks into a hall, but my favorite is when he pretends to shoot himself in the head with his hand. Taxi Driver also has one of the greatest lines in movie history. ""Are you talking to me. Well I'm the only one here."" That line is often miss quoted as simply. ""Are you talking to me."" That is very wrong. Taxi Driver also has one of the greatest characters ever put on film in Travis Bickle. The story is genius, I love how they show Travis as a loner, not a psychopath, or more precisely a loner in the beginning. The screenplay is great, the dialogue is amazing, but the true miracle is the character of Travis Bickle. The acting is amazing, Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances of all time, while Jodie Foster and others are all great. The direction is great, it is the best direction Martin Scorsese has done, and he is the second best director alive right behind Steven Spielberg. The visual effects are great, everything looks real. Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever, watch it."

","A tremendous film. The line ""I am God's lonely man..."" might be the best line ever written in modern cinema. It is an interesting look at a common emotion and an uncommon reaction to it. I've always found the fact that DiNiro's character was an ex-Marine interesting especially because it is not emphasized at all in the movie. In many ways I think it is as much of an examination of the psyche of soldiers trained to kill as it is a look at loneliness. Just one of the greatest scripts I've ever seen and it is executed brilliantly. The camera work is ground breaking as well. Phenomenal film. I personally believe it to be one of DiNiro's best performances. His use of method is appropriate here."
"GavAnderson","10","1","2","16 September 2005"," A dark and compelling tale of loneliness, unmatched to this day
","Written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro taking the lead role, there really was never any chance of 'Taxi Driver' being any less than brilliant. Its one of De Niro's best roles, his performance is so good that it sends shivers down my spine every time I see it. To anyone who hasn't seen the film, De Niro plays a character called Travis Bickle, a man who takes a job as a taxi driver having been discharged from the army. It is through this job that he becomes disillusioned by all the crime and ""filth"" he sees around him and decides to take matters into his own hands. He is a challenging and multi layered character that De Niro brings to life with huge success. He may be a very extreme depiction of loneliness but even so he still seems every bit as real as you or me, he is a likable character to whom most people will be able to relate. That's the real genius of De Niro's performance; he makes you believe in Bickle no matter what he does.<br/><br/>It was an early film for Scorsese who has since gone on to become one of the top names in Hollywood, but I would still regard this as his very best work. The night scenes are unmatched for their dark and gritty atmosphere, and the sense of loneliness that you share with Bickle throughout the film is chilling no matter how many times you watch it. However, Scorsese and De Niro alone don't make this a great film, there's Paul Schrader's masterpiece of a script, the haunting Bernard Herrmann score, and the A-list cast, that all come tougher to make this a living classic. The 70's brought many greats, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen it yet you really need too, especially if you're a Scorsese or De Niro fan, it's a superb film and a great addition to any collection. Highly recommended."

"mcshortfilm","10","1","2","31 July 2005"," a film that's beautifully ""organazized""
","It's not everyday when you come across an ""out of body' experience. The last time I felt it at the movies was when I saw Star Wars. That was before I saw Taxi Driver. I rented Taxi Driver with some friends seventeen years after its theatrical release.I was blown away. My friends and I didn't say a word until ten minutes after it was over. How was it that a movie like this could have such an impact?<br/><br/>The film stars Robert DeNiro as Travis Bickle who takes on a taxi career after serving in the Marines in Vietnam and suffering from some horrible discharge. From the beginning we already feel something unpleasant about Travis. We can see that he's lonely, reserved and a bit socially awkward. We sense something more intense underneath but we don't really know what it is. Wandering into porn movie theaters makes him seem even more lonely and perverted. This is his quality time after long days of witnessing a violent atmosphere of pimps, prostitutes and homeless drug addicts.Taxi life sure isn't the solution to his miserable and solitary life. Bur one day, Travis spots a girl played by Cybil Shepard who works at a campaign headquarter for a presidential candidate. We watch Travis trying to flirt and ask her out and although it seems charming to an average bimbo, it comes across as totally awkward. There are long pauses of silence and observations that sound creepily insulting. ""I can see the way you carry yourself that you're not a happy person"" he says. When he takes her out to lunch, we see Travis's loneliness amplified with a a mild sense of paranoia. This scene is utterly ironic in how we see a typical first date as sounding nervous and alienating. Who is this guy? Cybil seems intrigued by him and is reminded of a Kris Kristoferssen song: ""he's a poet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction."" It's a great description of Travis but he immediately gets insulted. Rather then analyze the song, he just gets defensive."" ""I'm not a pusher and I never have pushed."" He proves himself wrong. After a bad date of trying to take her to a porno movie, he can't take ""no"" for an answer. We start to see more of Travis's creepy personality unfold as he obsesses over her by sending flowers and finally bursting in the office to yell and scream at her. Why does'nt he get it? After all the drunks, weirdos and psychos he picks up, could'nt he learn something ? No, instead, he is driven to a plan of madness. We don' know exactly what but its definitely building inside him. We see this in an amazing scene with Peter Boyle outside a cafeteria. Their interaction reinforces the loneliness and alienation between these characters. Its a quiet scene but its so true in its portrayal that it seem scary. <br/><br/>The film looks like a documentary at times because we see street action in the background that weaves in and out of the foreground giving you a sense of real life drama. Some of the shots are particularly shocking and so matter of fact. When an encounter with a pimp turns bloody, we see it from a distance as if we were pedestrians witnessing a crime. The violence in this film is anything but glorified. It puts the film in a gritty and dirty atmosphere that we don't want to participate in. But its not just the violence that hooks us in, its the bizarre and psychological mysteries that carry the story. How did Travis get infatuated with Cybil Shepard? Was it coincidence that she worked for the presidential nominee? How events happen and get traced in this film is utterly disturbing. I still can't explain how a film could have an impact to the magnitude that it did. One thing I do know is the director (Martin Scorsese), the screenwriter (Paul Schrader) and the main actor (Robert DeNiro) were all going through similar experiences during the making of this film. That is rare in a field that involves a lot collaboration. When it does happen it as it did, it becomes truly magical. This is without a doubt, Scorsese's best film to date."
"TheFilmConnoisseur","10","1","2","24 July 2005"," ""Someday a big rain will fall and wash all the scums off the streets.""
","Travis Bickle is perhaps the darkest character director Martin Scorsese has ever dealt with and perhaps his darkest film as well. This is a character and film with a lot of hate. Some consider Bickle to be a loner, but sometimes he appears to be a man with a lot hatred to his surroundings. Could it be a political or social statement by Scorsese? Or perhaps that Paul Schrader was going through depression when he wrote the script? Whatever the answer might be, all I can say is that this is a very powerful film. If you are like me when this film is over your mouth will be wide open. Bickle (in a perfect performance by Robert De Niro) is a scary character. Although his motives are positive (sometimes) the way he gets results is a little extreme. Then again it was the '70s. I'm sure there's a lot of Travis Bickles out there. And they would probably love this movie as much as I do.<br/><br/>RATING: 4 STARS (****) The film is a little too dark, but in a way thats why it's so awesome!"

","Taxi Driver is a masterful art film of the highest caliber. It is my second favorite film of all time, second only to Apocalypse Now. The film is a journey that forces the viewer to travel deep within the mind of a man who is all alone, lost within a crowd of millions. Travis Bickle, played to perfection by Robert De Niro, is sick of all of the scum that walks the streets of New York. He searches for some sort of purity and beauty, and finds it in Betsy. Unfortunately, he allows the scum of the Earth to ruin his relationship with her. And it is his fault. Thus, he joins the scum of the Earth, in his own way. He realizes this, and knows that he has to do something about it. In a search for meaning in his life, he ultimately decides to unleash his rage on scum. He lets the rain wash the trash away. The shootout at the finale is fierce, violent, and breathtaking. In the end, justice is served, in a strange way. Bang! Bang! Bang! Taxi Driver is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. The visuals are painted on the screen. And the score is one that will never get out of your head. And what a fantastic screenplay."
"sol-","Null","1","2","6 May 2005"," My extended review of the film
","'Taxi Driver' has deservedly earned a reputation as one of the best films of 1976. It has however also often been called one of the best films of all time. Whilst it is a brilliant piece of cinema, with a superb lead performance and some excellent camera-work, it is nevertheless hard for me to agree with the claim of it as an all-time great.<br/><br/>To start with the good things, 'Taxi Driver' is excellently directed. The whole atmosphere of the streets of New York is captured very well, both in the daytime and at night. The film has a great visual style, giving the streets a dreamlike quality, and it all feels very realistic, or at least up until the final 15 minutes. The cinematography captures De Niro's journey perfectly, with zooms, steady-cam and panning all carefully distributed and edited into the film.<br/><br/>It is a character study of a man alone and it definitely digs deep into the protagonist. We are given an insight into his loneliness and are subjected to his social ineptitude. Some of his actions still seem a tad unrealistic, like with the movie date he goes on, but in general, Travis Bickle is quite a well written character, and De Niro plays him sensationally. Every single movement on his face is carefully observed, and it left me wondering all the time whether or not he is insane.<br/><br/>However, this is a point when some of the quirks I have with the film occur. For a character study we get to know relatively little about Travis' background. He served in the marines and now he is a taxi driver. At one stage of the film he listens to a speech about Vietnam vets fighting for better treatment. Does this mean that Travis served in Vietnam, and did Vietnam drive him insane? We never really get to know. This is not necessarily a bad thing as such, as it adds to his mysteriousness, and the film still survives, but it did at least have me groping for a bit more.<br/><br/>Also while discussing De Niro's high quality performance, what pops into mind is how the other performers in the film were. And that is a bit of problem in my books. Foster received a lot of critical attention at the time of the film's release for playing a prostitute so young. Yet, looking at her in retrospect she hardly does anything with her character. Or what there is of her character, and there is not all too much there, other than that she is younger than the average prostitute, and like the average prostitute, she is sort of unhappy with her work, but yet manages to get by okay. In fact, none of the characters other than Travis' are well developed or well acted. Sure, they aren't poorly written and performed, but 'Taxi Driver' does have to survive on just one good performance and one good character. And actually, considering that, the film gets by quite well.<br/><br/>But all that said, Martin Scorsese has a memorable cameo role as a taxi passenger who might just be slightly madder than Travis. Interestingly, from what I've read, Scorsese only took the part because the actor assigned to play the character did not show up on the day of shooting, and despite that Scorsese actually gives off the second best performance in the film, right after De Niro's.<br/><br/>A couple of other points worth noting on the negative side are the meandering nature of the film and the music. Neither of these aspects subtracts much from the film, but they do add to the charge that it is not quite a perfect film. The picture wanders around quite a bit to show the nature of De Niro's mind, but this does make it a tad tiresome to follow about. As for the music used in the film, Bernard Herrmann's score is highly memorable and great to listen to, but it is more so dinner music rather than a fitting score for such a realistically grim film.<br/><br/>In spite of the problems that I have with the film that I have already mentioned, it is a very solid watch until the final 15 minutes. The film is all rather well put together, and if were not for the film's reputation of perfection, the points I've mentioned would be hardly worth going into detail about. But, the final 15 minutes of the film do seal it as something that I would be cautious to call perfect.<br/><br/>The ending is not weak, but compared to the rest of the film the final few scenes are highly unrealistic. The violence and brutality is the type that you would expect in a cartoon, and what happens to Travis in the end is so unrealistic that some have their own interpretations about a sense of reality. But it is hard to discuss this without revealing details that may ruin one's first viewing of the film.<br/><br/>At this point in time, I have only seen 8 films from Martin Scorsese, and 'Taxi Driver' is one of only four that I've seen twice. However, I would still be inclined to call it Scorsese's best film. It pretty well made all round, even if not pretty to watch, and perhaps it is one of the best films of the 1970s. There is however enough in it for me to have my reservations about saying how great it is."
"scorsese-1","10","1","2","10 April 2005"," A tour de force by the brilliant Martin Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese establishes himself as one of the greatest directors of all time with the movie Taxi Driver. He examines, urban loneliness and despair through the character of Travis Bickle, brilliantly portrayed by Robert Deniro. With direct homage to the classic John Ford western The Searchers, Scorsese traces the events that lead to the release of a young girl being prostituted by a pimp named Sport. Similarly,in The Searchers a character named Ethan, played by John Wayne, is in a desperate search for his niece abducted by an Indian named Scar. The main characters in both films are both lonely wanderers and war veterans. Travis's destiny takes a turn after an unsuccessful attempt to establish a relationship with a girl played by Cybill Shepherd. He subsequently purchases several guns, which symbolically represent phallic symbols through which he will ultimately release his suppressed sexuality. In the final segment,when he ultimately confronts Sport, he points the gun at him and says ""suck on this"". Then he proceeds on a bloody rampage to release the young girl, which metaphorically represents a cathartic sexual release for Travis. This scene is absolutely riveting. The direction and the pacing throughout is impeccable.The mood is greatly enhanced by a superb score by Bernard Hermann. A modern masterpiece."

","Taxi Driver is an important film of the 70's and above else is one of the best films of all-time for sure. The whole story to this magnificent movie is simply great. Even though it basically tells about a taxi cab driver the whole time and him just driving around and picking up scums. Robert DeNiro who the main character in this movie is also the narrator and it's just simply amazing how he tells about the bad people on the streets and how this city needs to be cleaned up. I just couldn't put in words how much the movie was very descriptive. The actors were excellent and that was the first movie, I think Jodie Foster has played in as she was a 12 year old forced to be prostitute and Harvey Keitel, being the rude and furious owner.

","The most interesting thing I found in it is the tender scene of Sport and Iris. I still couldn't figure out what exactly does it mean. It came from nowhere and took a long time and Sport looked so full of true love and compassionate to Iris and even the entire human race! I think that's the most unusual element. And Martin Scorsese's madness is also interesting, maybe that's what persuaded the killer finally made up his mind. When Travis pointed his gun to the mirror and talked ironically to himself: ""You talking to me?!"" I couldn't laugh, on the contrary I feel sympathy for him, maybe myself too. Good movies sometimes are like a mirror that reflects our own weakness. And the camera-work is brilliant, as hypnotic as the jazz score, and those slow motions which show us what Travis see with his tired eyes recall the beautiful opening of the Last Waltz. This film also reminds me a lot of Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart. A young man who suffered from the material world, tried many solutions but all failed (When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low, and resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow), then he decided to do something really usually (And we're changing our ways, taking different roads). But is he saved? The streets were still dirty and Betsy's smile couldn't move him anymore. (Just that something so good just can't function no more) Even Iris's fate is doubtful, she just disappeared and left only those papers on the wall. (Then love, love will tear us apart again.)"

","Taxi Driver is the best film of the century. Martin Scorsese's use of point of view show the mind of the tortured Vietnam, veteran, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). The film is loosely inspired by John Ford's The Searchers. Paul Schrader's excellent script is obviously based on some of Dostoevsky's novels. Harvey Keitel is outstanding as the pedophile pimp. Martin Scorsese was not nominated for an Academy Award, but it is his best work. The movie was almost given an X rating for extreme violence. Jodie Foster as the 12 year old prostitute received her first Oscar nomination (best supporting actress). The film lost out in the Best Picture category to John G. Avildsen's Rocky. The most memorable shot in the film is the scene where Bickle is talking to Betsy. The camera moves past him and focuses on an empty hallway. This symbolizes Bickle's loneliness."
"krillin123","Null","1","2","8 October 2004"," great performances from lots of stars in their early days
","I was impressed with every actor and actress here. De Niro, Shepherd, Foster, and Keitel all played their respective roles very well. They had a great story and script to back them up. I really liked how the plot was fairly simple (the title sums up the main character and the setting) yet great depth was added to the characters and the story as a whole. This was achieved through monologues by De Niro and conversations between characters that told us how they each felt. I also liked how the film was broken up into several threads that really weren't related except through the involvement of the main character. For example you had the relationship with Betsy (Shepherd) and the saving a prostitute (Foster) from her life as one. Also interesting was how De Niro's character Travis evolved throughout the film. You had the veteran looking for a job that became his life, then the gun addict then the good samaritan who wanted to save one particular girl from prostitution. I also liked the way the film was shot. Lighting was often used noticeably (for example Travis and his taxi driver friends were often illuminated by a red neon light that surrounded them). The lighting was usually sparse to match the dark atmosphere which was very appropriate to the story. There were also some interesting camera shots and angles. There was always plenty of time to think about what the characters were feeling and reflect on the action that had just taken place (for example in the final scene we get a nice long sequence covering everything thats just happened, again). The sound track and score were also very appropriate and always seemed to fit the scene perfectly. You know it's a good score when you don't notice it much because you're not surprised by it. i.e. there's no unexpectedly up beat tunes. This may also work the other way but in this film there wasn't much upbeatness so it was never an issue to have slow music in a happy scene."

The character he played Travis Bickle was recently voted the greatest anti-hero of all time and anyone who has ever watched Taxi-Driver would have to agree with that.<br/><br/>De Niro gives a masterful performance as Travis Bickle a Vietnam veteran who is a loner and is slowly going mad. Through De Niro's performance we can watch him going mad as he drives his taxi through all the scum of New York. He chooses to work at night where the worst of New York can be seen.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle gets himself armed to the teeth and you know its only a matter of time before he explodes. He shots dead a punk trying to raid his local store and the owner is grateful to him. His character shows genuine concern for Jodie Foster's character who is only 12 and a prostitute. It seems she wants help but is trapped in a world of pimps and junkies. Travis Bickle takes it on himself to take them all on with very bloody results.<br/><br/>This is a truly classic film and probably one of the best De Niro-Actor Scorese-Director collabrations. Scorese evens has a cameo in the film.<br/><br/>De Niro didn't win an Oscar for his performance in this film amazingly enough though he was up against Jack Nicholson's performance in One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. In fact De Niro has only ever won two Oscars but his performances in Film's over the years should have netted him at least 10. Taxi driver was made 29 years ago but hasn't dated and is still relevant today. I would love to see a sequel of Taxi Driver and see what happened to Travis Bickle. The DVD is really good, the extras include a 70 minute documentary where all the main characters talk about the film. It is rare for De Niro to give interviews but he does here and he is clearly proud of this film. The only disappointment is there is no Directors Commentary. Hopefully one day they will rectify this and Both Scorses an De Niro can get together to to do a commentary for this film."

The entire film was about Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a vietnam soldier that has nowhere to go or nowhere to start, so he chooses his new life as a Taxi Driver. He hates what he sees on the streets, he wishes that all the scum and filth would be rid of. Martin Scorsese treats New York as one of his stars because he shows what went on in New York in the eyes of Travis Bickle. Travis meets a beautiful woman name Betsy played by the seductive Cybill Shepard. She is like the perfect chick that any guy would like to screw in bed, including Tom played nerdy by Albert Brooks. After seeing a porn flick, Betsy breaks up with Travis and that's where Travis loses his mind. He starts getting guns, and practices by trying to figure out who to kill. Travis befriends a twelve year old prostitue name Iris(a young Jodie Foster) for whom he wants to help her by getting rid of her pimp Sport(played by Harvey Keitel). <br/><br/>I forgot to mention Peter Boyle's character as Wizard, he is the only character in the film that tries to help Travis before he goes off the brink of insanity. I liked Peter's performance.<br/><br/>All in all, everybody should talk to lonely people or befriend them no matter how weird or goofy they are. I loved Robert De Niro's performance as the psycho that just lost control of himself. I love the fact that Robert pulled a stunt like that.

","Marty Scorsese is one of my favorite directors, and I really like his work on this film.  It's very stylistic (without trying to be) and loaded with fresh, creative camera shots.  The score is haunting and reinforces the loneliness of DeNiro's character.  The supporting cast of Kitel, Foster and Shepard are perfect, with each portraying his or her character with authenticity and feeling.  From the humor of Bickle pouring whiskey on his bread, to his pitiful attempts to win back Betsy, to the abrupt and chilling debut of the mohawk haircut indicating that he's definitely gone insane, this film runs the emotional spectrum.  I only have one gripe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I'm disappointed that Bickles doesn't die after the shoot out.  For him to go from killing the pimp, the john and the brothel manager (and then, unsuccessfully, himself after he sprays the manager's brain on the wall) to his reintegration to society and subsequent rise to hero status for saving the young prostitue was just too unbelievable and contrived.  He was willing to heroically and tragically sacrafice himself to save Iris, but this gets erroded by the fact that he lives and suffers seemingly no consequences for his actions.  He would most certainly be locked up tight in a mental facility after the carnage he inflicts on those people, even if they were scum.  Also, I don't feel his return to a normal life was a dream or a fantasy in Bickle's mind because they show him with a noticeable scar on his neck and favoring his right arm from the gun shot wounds.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film that could have had a stronger impact with a slightly different ending."

"sddavis63","5","2","7","28 November 2010"," You Spend Too Much Of Your Time Waiting
","There's more than a few things about this film that are worth liking - and liking very much. Two names stand out in particular as I assess the strong points in this: Robert Deniro and Martin Scorsese. Deniro was excellent as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who ends up driving a taxi because he can't sleep at night. This isn't your typical ""Vietnam vet goes crazy"" movie. Aside from the fact that Travis identifies himself as a former Marine when he applies for the taxi driver's position nothing connects him to Vietnam. We assume that as an ex-Marine, discharged in 1973, he must have seen action in Vietnam, but the war there plays no role of significance in this. Essentially the entire movie is about Bickle's slow descent. He starts out as a relatively normal character, a guy who decides to make some money off his insomnia. Why not? Deniro was quite convincing as Bickle, depicting a decline that was believably gradual. Part of the credit, of course, has to go to director Scorsese as well. His direction helped build the character. He also managed to paint a totally convincing picture of a New York City in complete decay - a grimy city filled with pimps and prostitutes and drug pushers, with little apparently to redeem it. It's not a very flattering portrayal of the city that never sleeps, but it does paint a picture of what happens while the city isn't sleeping! So credit to both Deniro and Scorsese for doing effectively what they set out to do - which was painting a convincing and realistic picture.<br/><br/>But there are problems here as well. Frankly speaking, while you watch Bickle's slow evolution (and admire Deniro's portrayal of it) you also spend most of this movie waiting. You wait for something to happen. And you wait. And then you wait some more. Yes, Scorsese made a hard-edged, realistic film. The problem is that reality doesn't always need to be portrayed. An hour goes by in this and as much as you're admiring Deniro, you're also wondering where this is going, because nothing much seems to be happening. Sure, Travis got obsessed with Becky (Cybill Shepherd) and he ended up blowing it. It seemed a couple of times as if something was going to happen as a result of that but nothing really does. Things get somewhat more interesting with the introduction of Iris (Jodie Foster) - a child prostitute Travis meets and sets out to save. That relationship is somewhat interesting, but still you wait. It's like you're a dog and Scorsese is holding a bone just beyond your reach. You know it's there and you want it, but you can't get it. The movie becomes frustrating after a while, because you know it's leading to something but there seems surprisingly little meat to chew on. Adding to the frustration is a musical score that itself seemed lifeless and inappropriate to the setting.<br/><br/>There's something of a blood bath in the last 15 minutes or so - almost an explosion after waiting so long for what we knew was coming. There's also a pretty effective twist at the end, as Scorsese manages to get the viewer reflecting on what's normal and what's not. The whole movie seems to depict Travis sliding farther and farther out of touch with reality; the ultimate irony of the movie is that he ends up as something of a hero - which is unsettling, frankly. That was interesting and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Still, a movie that left me waiting for so long loses a bit. Non stop action is not required. Far from it. But it often felt as if there were no point at all to this; little that it was building to. I have to say that I think it's over-rated, but certainly worth watching."
"markymarky","6","2","7","13 January 2010"," Not as good as I expected...
","I received the two-disc special edition DVD of Taxi Driver for a Christmas present and was delighted to get it as I have never watched this much-heralded movie. I knew all about it from the whole 'You talking to me' comment by De Niro and when I saw it was number 40 in the IMDb top 250 - my appetite was truly whetted.<br/><br/>But it was not satisfied.<br/><br/>I watched the film and was impressed with the acting of De Niro - he really does live the character. However, the storyline for me was weak. The whole 'returning vet going mad' bit I got, but the process in which the story was unveiled to us was poor in my opinion. Maybe, I am not high-brow enough to understand all the various levels of loneliness, sub-conscious inward pain but the whole thing for me just did not hang together well. It drifted towards boring at some times and nonsense at other times. I'll try to back up these acidic comments by some examples (in no specific order): <br/><br/>1. Why was Bickle targeting Palantine? After meeting him in his cab, he seemed to think that he was a good, solid guy. Yet it looked like he was trying to kill him later on. Why?<br/><br/>2. As Bickle tries to clean up some of the scum - i.e. a good, almost heroic act - it seemed to clash with his general behaviour. He wasn't a very nice person but yet he carries out a good deed in relation to humanity.<br/><br/>3. Why did Bickle bring Betsy to a dirty movie for a date? Is he that stupid that he didn't realise that it would more than likely be offensive? <br/><br/>4. What was the point of the scene with Martin Scorsese in the taxi as a passenger telling Bickle about his plans to kill his wife? Meaningless if you ask me.<br/><br/>5. The secret service scene also is ridiculous. Bickle is a veteran army guy - why does he blatantly 'out' himself as an obvious weirdo to these guys? Acting strange, giving a wrong address. Why? <br/><br/>There are other issues with this film - the grating, overbearing score, the washed out (censor influenced) ending, De Niro's ever-growing/receding hairstyle. So as a movie, I personally feel a little let down. There was nothing to bring me in to this fan club here. Foster's portrayal as a 12 year old prostitute is okay (good for a 12 year old, but nothing spectacular), Keitel was only okay as the pimp (over-pimping it in my opinion) and Shepard did nothing for me (I might have a little bias towards her as I never warmed to her as an actress).<br/><br/>It's one of those films that if done by anyone else then it would be rubbished. But because it's Scorsese and De Niro - everyone loves it. A little like The Deer Hunter if you ask me - another overblown, overrated flick.<br/><br/>6/10."

"andrewburgereviews","10","1","3","5 October 2019"," The loner who wants to bring in the Apocalypse
","I will be honest, I struggled to appreciate Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". Despite the insightful script by the self-consuming Paul Schrader who created one of the most opaque and great film characters of all time, Travis Bickle, frighteningly good portrayed by Robert De Niro there was nothing that I could put my hand on. But I did not hate it either, and I felt if I was not praising it, I would be doing something wrong.<br/><br/>The reason why I believe it was so difficult to enjoy this film is because this film is not made to be enjoyed, is made to be experienced. We are put in intimacy with Travis Bickle, but he is a sick man. An incurable loner and a racist, he seems unable to connect with anybody. It is like a disease. So we feel his frustration and his anger. He blames his inability to bond with other human beings on the world. He would want an apocalypse that would clean all the ""scum"" off the streets yet throughout the movie, he keeps attempting to connect with it. This inner struggle and his lack of understanding of his own condition makes this movie a nightmare, yet one constructed on a deep psychological level.<br/><br/>I feel Scorsese has a love-hate relationship with New York, the city where this movie takes place. He depicts it in a noire-inspired style, steam rising from the canals and surrounded by a bleakness as if hell itself lurks just below. But New York is something else for everyone and here, we see it through the eyes of a self-inflicted sociopath. Throughout the movie, Travis tries again and again to socialize and it is difficult and painful watching him fail. He first tries to flirt with the cashier at an X-rated cinema he frequently visits, he then briefly dates a political volunteer--everything ends in failure yet he keeps struggling through this Sisyphean nightmare just hoping to find something.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle it's a difficult man to comprehend. Another reason why I struggled to love this movie is because I felt like so many of his philosophies, his thoughts were hidden away from me. He does not speak a lot and the gap between his words and his actions leave much to the interpretation. Scorsese and Schrader briefly reveal to us his thoughts through narration but these are more haunting and disturbing than explanatory. The way he would repeat his last sentence with emphasis denotes an insane determination, almost like a mind-control.<br/><br/>But there is one thing to realize about Bickle--he is looking for a purpose which he finds when he attempts to rescue a young prostitute who ran away from home. In his insanity, his appearance and mannerisms become more and more twisted yet you can feel a determination because he feels he is heading towards some sort of peace. Then there is, of course, the ending. It's impossible to know whether it is real or not but in both cases this is true--it represents his most hidden desires. He just wants to mean something. The sudden way in which the film takes a turn towards a more positive atmosphere is so sudden that you have a feeling it was done intentional. It is impossible for Scorsese not to be aware of such a sudden slope.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" can be a depressing film. The way Bickle drives his yellow cab through the slums feels like Dante taking his tour through hell. But what an achievement for Scorsese and Schrader. They took a man impossible to connect to and they made us connect to it. What I realized after watching this movie and what made me decide that it is, indeed, a masterpiece was just how relatable Travis Bickle can actually be. How many of us are looking for peace? How many of us have attained it and how many still have hope that they will attain it eventually?"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","30 June 2019"," From zero to hero
","""Taxi Driver"" is an American movie from 1976, so this one is already over 40 years old now and it runs for slightly under 2 hours. The director is Martin Scorsese and lead actor is Robert De Niro and if you take a look at how big these two have been for decades now, it is very telling that this film here is still a contender for career-best for both of them. De Niro also scored a lead actor Oscar nomination and the film managed to get in for Best Picture as well while eventually not winning any of its 4 nominations. The script writer was Paul Schrader here and this was his only Academy Award nomination, but he is still active today and perhaps was not too far away from his second with his recent work on Ethan Hawke's First Reformed. Anyway, back to this one here. It is the story of a man who cannot sleep at night and to do something useful for once, he decides to start working as a taxi driver, a profession in which he gets in contact with all kinds of absurd characters, most of them just as bizarre as himself. And at the same time, he is in a position when he is basically just their servant, barely interacting with them and most are glad it is this way like the rich guy with the Black prostitute in the backseat. Or the guy who pulls out Foster's character early on. Yep that is true Jodie Foster is in this film too. She already was a quite experienced actress back then despite her age of 14 or so and I quite like her. Still I must say the Oscar nomination was a bit much if we take a closer look at the performance. Compared to other all-time great young age (female) performances that managed such a nomination like Hailee Steinfeld for example, she was not too outstanding and I am somewhat glad she did not win. I think I even read she was considered a frontrunner, or at least second. We will never know. But she cannot complain anyway with how her career developed since then. 2 Oscar wins, a successful filmmaker as well. I like it. She is always pretty likable in my opinion and I am glad her career got a nice boost through that movie here.<br/><br/>But there is no denying De Niro is the film from beginning to end and he proves he is among the defining actors of his generation here without a doubt and that The Godfather was not just a one time thingey. Also the make-up crew helped him a lot. His visual appearance changes so much during this film it is pretty memorable the way how his face looks and of course I am also talking about his haircut towards the end that is kinda epic together with his entire appearance in these moments when everything escalates or is about to escalate. With that I am obviously referring to the scene when he is about to shoot the politician, but also when he saves the girl eventually. This is what I am referring to with the title of my review when he is about the become the next Lee Harvey Oswald, but instead turns into kind of a national hero. Travis Bickle sure is a really interesting character. People say he is fed up with the horrible state his city is in and the people that live there in terms of crime and sleaze and it sure is true and what he says to Palantine is not make-believe, but what also inspires him to commit this crime of politicide (is that a word? anyway, you know what I mean) is that he gets rejected by Shepherd's character and also the way how he does. He meant all well to her, but her reaction is really crass stating explicitly that he is low-class scum compared to her and the nice gesture of giving her the record is destroyed completely by the few words that she has it already and does not care one bit about having it twice then as long as she gets away from him as quickly as possible. And she does so in a taxi which is extra humiliation for him. Fate also gets in the way for once as on one occasion she is not there when he shows up at the campaign headquarter. On another, she is and after trying to talk to her reasonably unsuccessfully, we see his anger finally and also that he is a bit of a woman hater. Or maybe just a society hater as he finally sees her as part of the all-around evil as well, not just in the building, but in the rotten city. Of course, her white knight colleague stepping in is not really helping things either. I still must say I kinda wondered why he got this close to Palantine honestly, because he really does not seem like an alpha male, even if he is a decent organiser I suppose. The white knight I mean of course.<br/><br/>I got to watch this movie as part of a film series on the city of New York here in Berlin and while many movies felt they were really just included because they were set in New York and hardly offered anything about the city, this one here is different and there is major focus on the situation of the people there and also the cultural climate there, so good choice for sure. Except of course that this film is considered a classic by many. Take a look at the rating and number of votes and enough is said. This film moving closer and closer to its half-century anniversary is still easily filling theaters and there are so many references in pop culture about it still, that it is probably alway gonna be this way. I myself would not say it is too great or epic or underappreciated by awards bodies back then and there really wasn't a moment when I considered giving it more than 3 stars out of 5, but there also was not a moment on the other end of the scale when I thought it should get less and thus a negative recommendation. De Niro most of all, and secondly the script, really make it a worthwhile watch that feels considerably shorter than almost two hours. There are also a handful of fun scenes, such as of course the (in)famous mirror scene (that I still don't consider as epic and defining), a pretty hilarious, but also dark scene filmed inside a car that shows us why his taxi driver job was also a bit extraordinary and this one was mostly memorable because the taxi guest sitting in the back who was filled with hate was played by Scorsese himself. Pretty funny and he is so unrecognizable with his looks when he was younger haha. I think many audience members did not recognize him despite him being still among the most defining and most famous filmmakers of our generation. All this black hair and beard haha. And of course the final 15-20 minutes are also incredibly unique with how things turn out eventually and probably helped giving the film the status it has today. Even the slightly forgettable return of Shepherd's character there works nicely, even if it's tough to remember anything really that happens after the shootings. Now no more spoilers I guess. All in all a good movie. Go watch it if you want and don't mind the violence. A must-see especially for everybody who loves De Niro like myself, even if I must say this is nowhere near his finest movies, maybe closer to his finest performances. Go for it, if you are old enough that is. They had to escort a young viewer out when the film began in my screening hehe."

Martin Scorsese has crafted a moody drama film set in his native streets of New York and the cinematography is sublime. It makes you feel uneasy because you are on the level of Travis.

His attempt is foiled by the Secret Service and he flees.<br/><br/>One can not develop any kind of feeling for this negative anti- social character.( I have seen many movies and shows having negative characters in the lead) but this character is not one with which one develops any remote likability.<br/><br/>The climax is packed with action as Travis attempts to take out the ""scum of the city"" and rescue Iris.After gunning down Iris's pimp and 3 others,Travis goes on to kill himself after the shootout.But before that he passes out from his wounds as Police arrive.<br/><br/>Next we know Travis Bickle is hailed as a ""hero"" in the papers and receives much appreciation from Iris's parents.And he goes on with his life.......<br/><br/>Bland.I expected this '76 classic being paced slow but it really crawled.This movie wouldn't score an 8.3 rating if it was released now in 2017"
"inemjaso","10","1","3","6 May 2017"," Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made
","I'm not sure where to begin talking about this classic, so I guess I'll start with its star: Robert DeNiro. Movie lovers have asked me in the past which of The Godfather actors had the most prolific career-Brando, Pacino, or DeNiro? Though Brando's career is probably unmatched in iconic presence and award merit, DeNiro takes the spot for me as the greatest actor of this trio. I, for example, thought he was superior to Brando as Vito Corleone. In Taxi Driver, DeNiro proves all skeptics that he's right up there with Nicholson as one of the all time greats. The film is told from the first person perspective of 20 something Vietnam vet Travis Bickle, played by DeNiro. Bickle is extremely lonely, depressed, and suffers from chronic insomnia. He works the night shift as a NYC cab driver and spends most of his free time in seedy pornographic theaters. DeNiro's performance in this movie, including his iconic monologue in front of the mirror, is perhaps the apex of his phenomenal career. In addition to DeNiro, Jodie Foster, an equally impressive actor, got her start here playing Iris, an adolescent prostitute whom Bickle attempts to save from her abusive pimp and general unsafe lifestyle. Overall, this film explores Bickle's damaged sense of reality, self and his emotional capacity for impulsive violence. It is a fine cinematic achievement that any fan of movies must see."
"gamermx-73830","10","1","3","20 April 2017"," A pure cult film
","Scorsese's favorite movie, even more than Goodfellas. Good rhythm, trama and performances. Don't even talk about the well- worked soundtrack and the good photography. Travis guide us all around NYC and show us the underground world whitout any kind of censorship.

","I have always been a fan of Robert Deniro, so I went into this movie already a little biased. That being said, I loved this movie. After finally watching it after years of hearing it referenced (without knowing it most of the time) I am so glad I finally watched it. For years I had been referencing ""You talking to me?"" without knowing where it came from. Being on the younger side of the audience for this film, I am used to seeing Deniro in rolls as an older gentleman (grandfather/father/older gangster type), kind of reserved and quiet no matter how bad-ass his character is. Travis sure was, for lack of a better word, a character. I got weird vibes from him in the beginning, then I hated him because he was creepy, then I realized he's a pretty good guy and I started to like him, then I was back to hating him because he was weird and kind of a jerk and really getting crazy when it came to Betsy and then Iris. In the end, he is the creepiest yet the most self-sacrificing, thoughtful character I've seen portrayed. The plot of the film itself was crazy, all over the place, constantly keeping you on your toes. I love how the narration and voice over is set up, I think that's what really sealed the deal of this being great for me. I will definitely be watching this again and it will be added to my long list of favorites."
"jackfreeman-west","10","1","3","3 March 2017"," A Truly Great Character Study
","The year was 1976, and armed with a budget of around 1.3 million dollars, director Martin Scorsese alongside the phenomenal acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster, crafted what was to become not only one of the greatest character studies of the last half-century, but also one of the greatest films of all time. Nominated for four Academy Awards upon release, the film's popularity has only risen over the years. The continued critical and fan interest in Scorsese's bleak masterpiece is evident, from the countless reviews, to the endless analyses, to the frequent birth of new theories and ideas regarding the film. I myself am among the many who believe that Taxi Driver has had an undeniable influence on cinema today, and that Travis Bickle is one of the most complex and intricately crafted characters we have ever witnessed – or will ever witness – on screen. <br/><br/>Since my first viewing of Taxi Driver, I have seen a number of films which tackle the themes of madness, depression, and violent tendencies; but none have ever been as focused, perfectly executed, or certain of their intentions as Scorsese's vigilante flick. Every single component of Taxi Driver works tirelessly to give us an intimate insight into the mind of its central figure, the troubled and tortured Travis Bickle. Travis is a retired marine who, as a result of his insomnia, decides to take up the job of a late night taxi driver; with his night time drives through the underbelly of the city sparking a violent hatred for the 'scum' that walk the streets in the early hours. Travis observes pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, vandals, and virtually every other form of degenerate; resulting in him ultimately coming to the decision that something has to be done. Someone needs to take a stand. <br/><br/>The outstanding quality of this film comes largely from the directorial choices of Martin Scorsese, who is very much in the driver's seat when it comes to this production. Almost every single shot serves to evolve the main character, with virtually no unimportant shots whatsoever. We see through the eyes of Travis as he makes his rounds, are shocked and disgusted along with him, and we feel very much a part of this character's world. The voice-over narration from Travis gives us further insight into his mind state, and allows us to establish clear milestones in his character arc. This masterfully formed character arc being one of the primary reasons that the film has achieved so much continued praise over the years. Travis' disturbing descent into psychosis is portrayed in such a way that no other film has ever been able to replicate its precision. However, none of this would have been possible without the writing talents of Paul Schrader, who does a wonderful job. I feel that every time I watch Taxi Driver, I acquire something more from the dialogue. Every single conversation draws you in and reveals more about the characters, particularly Travis, keeping the film absolutely focused as a character study. I am consistently gripped and intrigued by every word he speaks, and transfixed by his body language and facial expressions; and for me this gives the film a massive re-watchable quality. <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro shines as the top-billed actor and gives one of my favourite performances of all time. His history of method acting results in him totally embodying the character of Travis, with the subtleties of his acting bringing an intense realism to the role. 12-year-old Jodie Foster is also excellent as the underage prostitute who keeps Travis grounded and gives him a real reason to fight for justice. Harvey Keitel gives an interesting performance as the pimp, and shows an unpredictability that allows for some biting exchanges with Travis. Without revealing too much or diminishing the magic of key moments in the film, I would like to mention a couple of my personal favourite scenes. Many who have not seen the film will already be familiar with the often parodied ""You talking' to me?"" mirror sequence. With an instruction of nothing more than 'Travis talks to himself in the mirror', DeNiro managed to produce one of the greatest pieces of film improvisation in history. Martin Scorsese's brief appearance in the film proves to be one of the most memorable scenes. I will not say any more about this moment other than that it is a truly chilling cameo, and another example of the film's unrivalled character development. The film's explosive finale is also a jaw-dropping and unforgettable experience. <br/><br/>Finally I would like to briefly mention the fantastic score by the late Bernard Herrmann, which is a jazz piece that is heard multiple times throughout the film. Its smooth subtleties and building crescendo perfectly reflect and mirror the story of Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I see Taxi Driver as a film that no amount of praise can do justice. It is an intelligent, thought-provoking, and terrifying character study; with every aspect meticulously thought- out in order to create a character who is both involved and distanced, heroic and disgusting, relatable and insane. The film manages to feel alive, and bubbles with energy, despite dealing with rather subdued themes such as loneliness, depression and isolation. It is an outstanding film not only in the Scorsese canon, but in the crime genre in general; and it is unlikely that its importance and relevance will ever waver as a result of the deeply political undertones and references to child exploitation. It comes as no surprise that Taxi Driver has influenced many greats and spawned countless imitators, none of which ever managing to quite capture the genius of the original classic. As one of the best films that I have ever seen, I would highly recommend this motion picture to fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and cinema alike."

It is necessary to tell us all this part of the story,that he does not know anything and that he will pay it like this? From my point of view no. Scorsese's piece, what for?

","Taxi Driver is a true classic and one of the best films ever made. Robert DeNiro gives one of his most compelling performances as disaffected Vietnam war vet and mentally unstable loner. The film is mostly a character study of Travis Bickle, under the backdrop of NYC in the 1970's. Which was a truly dangerous, but interesting place. In this environment, our main man Travis boiling over in a violent rage is inevitable. Writer Paul Shrader and director Martin Scorsese crafted a very important, unique and real well crafted film that is a classic and influence many filmmakers to come. While there are many movies that have been influenced by Taxi Driver, very few of them are in the same class. Taxi Driver is Scorsese/Shrader's post Vietnam urban American masterpiece that is powerful, gritty and uncompromising. Robert DeNiro is pretty much always great, but this is one of his finest performances and I can't think of anyone who could play this character as well as he did here. I have a lot of admiration and respect for 70's cinema, an era where filmmakers had much more artistic control and had the balls to make movies like this."
"Sandcooler","10","1","3","16 May 2015"," Fantastic character study with a brilliant ending
","""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that thrives on the fact that anything Travis Bickle does is incredibly interesting. There's not much to the first hour, he just hangs around his apartment and occasionally drives a taxi. And yet, it's incredibly fascinating because there's so much suppressed rage in the character. You don't know what to think of him, but somehow you do know it can't go well for very long. When everything goes to hell you get a fantastic and pretty unpredictable ending, but it's the suspenseful build-up that really makes this movie a classic. Bickle is slowly driven to the edge by this filthy town full of whores, robbers, killers and Harvey Keitel with a stupid hat. You never know how he's going to react to a certain situation, which makes the violent outbursts very effective. In ""Taxi Driver"" Scorsese has very much the same style he was developing in ""Mean Streets"", but it seems like he has a lot more to say here. A truly unique movie by a director at the top of his league."
"codymontanye","8","1","3","13 May 2015"," Uncomfortable
","I was very excited to see this movie because I love the director Martin Scorsese. I have seen many of his films so knowing that he directed this really excited me, that and the fact that Robert De Niro had the starring role. Generally I would not consider this movie to be my type of movie because of its gritty feel and psychopathic nature of the main character. I really enjoyed the film though, but was kind of confused at times by the decisions that De Niro's character made. Honestly the whole film and Robert De Niro's performance kind of made me feel very uncomfortable, especially by the end of the movie. But I think that is a good thing and also a great testament to the acting skills of De niro and the directing skills of Scorsese. Right after I finished watching it I really didn't feel like I'd want to see it again, but after a bit of time I have had a reoccurring urge to go back and watch it because I feel like there is more that I could pick up on with a second viewing."

","I loved Taxi Driver. Great acting, cinematography and an ending that gets you thinking, and there is no right answer. Is Travis Bickle a hero, villain, or just nuts? What did the ending signify? I suspect this a movie that you could watch every 5 years or so and maybe come to a different conclusion as your perspective and society changes. This is what makes this a timeless movie. Travis was a Vietnam war veteran and we have veterans today struggling to integrate into society. To me he is a hero in that he is trying to do the right thing, but he is going a bit nuts in how he lives his life and what he sees as a taxi driver in seedy NYC."

","Taxi Driver (1976): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Robert De Niro, Cybil Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel: Provocative thriller about loneliness and the vessel of danger. Travis Bickle drives a cab and observes everything he hates. He tries to connect with two women. One is involved in a political campaign while the other is a teenage prostitute. Ending is both questionable and observant on how it presents the media as celebrating the diabolical and rewarding it through press. Directed skillfully by Martin Scorsese who previously scored acclaim with Mean Streets. Robert De Niro as Travis rose to great fame with this role. Bickle is a failure with women and cannot communicate appropriately even when his intentions are good. He answers rejection through an assassination attempt and a murder rescue, both of which bring different results. Cybil Shepherd plays Betsy whom he loses connection due to a fatal choice. She is working at a campaign when Travis bluntly asks her out. Jodie Foster plays Iris the teenage hooker he desires to save. Albert Brooks plays Betsy's campaign co-worker whom she doesn't connect with despite his work ethics and amusing demeanor. Harvey Keitel plays Iris's pimp who has a sly smooth demeanor that Bickle targets as a necessary kill. Dark and gritty reality of good intentions gone bad and unable to discern. Score: 9 / 10"

","Taxi Driver (1976). A movie about a Viet Nam vet, who takes a job as a nighttime cab driver, and eventually loneliness makes him what to do something violent. Now I normally don't put this up for older movies but I must say SPOILERS, because I will probably be giving away major plot points. Robert De Niro plays our main protagonist, Travis Bickle. De Niro's performance as Travis is the best I've ever seen in a movie, he's able to be a very relatable person with a hint of insanity in him, to the second half of the movie being psychotic, but somehow still likable The rest of the cast did pretty good. Jodie Foster's performance as Iris was good especially considering she was only 14 at the time. I loved the way the movie was able to show nighttime New York. It made it seem very reasonable why Travis hates the scum in the city. The music in the movie, was just a glorious thing to hear, it was mostly the saxophone and it fit the way New York's atmosphere was set up really well. The way the camera moves and catches whats happening, the angles and all are another reason why this is a great one. Palentine is the fictional senator in this movie that Betsy, the girl Travis is trying to date, works for. Betsy is at first a very likable character, but as Travis starts to dislike her so does the audience, a very good feat in the movie. The part when Travis's psychology takes a turn is when he takes a passenger to watch his wife silhouette in another man's apartment. Its a very disturbing and unsettling scene in the movie, but it's also one of the most important moments, because you can tell from the way the passenger is talking about killing his wife with a 44. Magnum and how Travis reacts and looks, that the passenger had given him an idea. This is when the loneliness starts to turn to violence. After that Travis starts to build himself an arsenal. A very good scene is when Travis is buying guns from easy Andy, it's great because of the way it's all played out. Another great thing about the movie is how you slowly start to see what Travis's plan is . Until it's revealed that he's going to kill Palentine, the buildup to the assassination is extremely suspenseful, all the tension rises until, the assassination fails. Most people probably know that the climax of the movie is a shootout among Travis and pimps, and lowlifes to save Iris. It's a very violent and shocking part, for today's standards, I can only imagine what it was like in 76. <br/><br/>The movie overall, was downright amazing, one of the best and favorites of the movies I've seen. It's strengths lies in it's excellent performance by Robert De Niro, the amazing directing from Martin Scorsese, the incredible writing from Paul Schrader, the music, everything that's set into motion makes this movie as great as it is, and it earns a 10 out of 10, one of 10 to get this high of a rating form me."
"barry_mooney","7","1","3","25 November 2012"," Doesn't stand the test of time
","Taxi Driver is clearly an iconic film that has gone down in history with many memorable moments. But it's an ideal example of a film that's nowhere near as good as it thinks it is. <br/><br/>De Niro is superb and portrays his complex character absolutely perfectly. Jodie Foster is good (for her age) but Harvey Keitel doesn't particularly shine (he seems a bit miscast) and the rest are kind of average at best (especially Cybill Shepherd). <br/><br/>From a plot perspective, Travis Bickle's search for a purpose in his trouble life is an interesting theme that holds the whole film together. But as good as it is, Taxi Driver now feels very dated and parts of it seem a bit laboured. The 'big scene' towards the end is not well handled at all in my opinion and just looks unrealistic. I'm sure it was all very shocking and groundbreaking in its day but it doesn't stand the test of time. <br/><br/>At the time of writing, Taxi Driver has an IMDb score of 8.5 – that's pretty high for a film such as this and actually puts it in a higher position (currently) than Reservoir Dogs, Full Metal Jacket and No Country for Old Men. It's nowhere near as good as any of those three and one would expect to see a much better film than Taxi Driver based on such a high IMDb score. However, I hate it when people deliberately give a film 1/10 just because they think a score is too high and they want to influence the average. It doesn't deserve 8.5 but it's still a good film. 7/10."
"big_poppa_hnoudis","10","1","3","12 November 2008"," In my opinion...the greatest film ever made.
","Everything about Taxi Driver is pure genius. The writing by Paul Schrader is hypnotic, a movie solely told from the point of view of a insomniac, isolated man cannot be told for very long without it becoming boring. Yet Taxi Driver doesn't have that problem, every line, every minute engages you, with lines like ""The days go on and on... they don't end. All my life needed was a sense of someplace to go. I don't believe that one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, I believe that one should become a person like other people."" Not only gives you insight to the inner workings of Travis, but gives it to you whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is sublime. Every shot has a purpose and a meaning behind it. Things like, no (or lack of) over the shoulder shots from other characters POV that Travis speaks to over the course of the film, shows that Travis doesn't connect with anybody, and he is slowly falling further and further into madness. Scorsese breaks the ""rules"" of traditional movies, makes new ones and still gives his tribute to film makers that inspired him like Goddard. De Niro's performance also brings the film to another level, his infamous ""You talking' to me?"" line was ad libbed, has since become one of the most quoted lines in cinema history.<br/><br/>If you have not yet seen Taxi Driver, get it today. Then smack yourself in the face for not having seen it earlier. If you've heard about the violent climax before hand, yes it is a brilliant scene, but it's more than just a lead up to a 4min violent shooting scene. There are another 98 minutes of sheer brilliance before hand. You may need more than one viewing to understand it completely, but yet, what great film doesn't?"

Because of sleeplessness and some other problems in his personal life he gets more and more obsessed with idea of cleaning the city from all kinds of low-lives.

"Brothepro","9","1","3","15 July 2007"," Top 100 but not top 10
","Taxi Driver is in my opinion an extremely good film. But, and this is a big but, it does not deserve to be in the top 10 films ever which many film critics put it in their top 10.<br/><br/>The story shows a man who is a taxi driver called Travis Bickle (who is played by Robert De Niro) wanting to get rid of what he calls the ""scum"" in New York City. Seems simple. Well it is not just quite like that as you see him as an average joe at first falling in love with a girl called Betsy and he wants to help this young girl Iris who is a prostitute to get away from the ""scum."" Robert De Niro's characterisation of Travis is superb, as he plays this creep who keeps in track of things through a diary. His voice his body language, everything he does is brilliant as you can see his transformation from Mr Nobody to Mr Violent Hero. There is also a tiny bit of humour in there as well as the violent transformation. For example De Niro pointing guns at the mirror saying one of the most famous lines of all time, ""Are you talking to me?"" The other characters though are not as good which in some ways are unsurprising as Robert De Niro reigns supreme as his character making the other characters look pathetic. Take Betsy, Bickle's love interest, she's plain and just a normal character. The problem is right there she is plain. Plain as a packet of Ready Salted crisps.She has nothing interesting about her except she supports senator Palatine which makes Bickle support him as well. That is the only thing that is remotely interesting. Although it did not help her getting a role that lasts for about twenty to thirty minutes.<br/><br/>The great thing is that it's a clever, well-crafted film as there are many perceptions from Travis, Betsy and Iris. Travis thinks that Betsy is good looking, he wants to help Iris because she is young and has potential and he wants to clear the mess up in this town. Meanwhile Betsy thinks Travis a weird average joe and Iris perceives Bickle to be a ""nark"" but she deep down realises that he wants to help her.<br/><br/>Overall, Scorcese has done magnificent work here by getting you to know and feel like Travis as he unleashes the beast within him and that is a good portrayal of what we want to sometimes do where the bitter aggression we have deep down wants to be released destructively and it is sown excellently in this film. 9/10"

","Taxi Driver is a dark psychological film about how deep a man can lose himself in his thoughts. Travis Bickle(Robert De Niro) is the anti-hero in all his glory. Travis feels like he is the loneliest person on earth, filled with an emptiness he cannot escape no matter where he goes or what he does in life. He is surrounded by all the dirty, disgusting, horrible things this world has to offer and craves for something to wash it all away. That something is Travis himself, the weapon against the scum of humanity. Scorsese's direction is very inventive in Taxi Driver, he uses shots that one would not expect and which brilliantly lead the viewer into Travis' subconscious. Paul Schrader's screenplay is realistic and colorful. Robert De Niro delivers one of his most true-to-life performances and shows just how involved an actor can get in developing a character. Taxi Driver is a film about a nobody, just like anybody, but who hides in his distorted mind's realm. This will always frighten audiences."
"bulleetz37235","10","1","3","14 July 2005"," ""Are You Talking To Me?""
","In my opinion I think that Taxi Driver is the best film ever made. Really I do, and I think this for many valid reasons.<br/><br/>1) The cast is so well integrated together that the overall effect of the characters is amazing, they have believable feelings and reactions to each other, and they carry the proper responses that real people would be considered to have, such as when DeNiro fantastically slips in professional fillers into his conversations with Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) or Iris (Played brilliantly by 14 year old Jodie Foster) and he seems to act accordingly to what is meant to be spontaneous speech, and the way he does this makes everything seem that more realistic, he also make for convincing viewing as he begins to lose his mind and buy guns and talk to himself. The slow winding down is portrayed to perfection by DeNiro and the more paranoid and more extreme his behaviour becomes, that little by little you know something big will happen but you don't know when, and it is this subtlety that makes it hard to tell when he actually became mad, it is feasible even to say he was mad at the start. It is this outstanding performance that he SHOULD have won the Best Actor Oscar in 1976 for this outstanding performance.<br/><br/>Cybil Sheppard makes a believable love interest, and her interest in music and the finer things is seriously well shown through her sheer displeasure in Travis Bickle (DeNiro) taking her to a porno movie for a date. Jodie Foster is a 12 year old hooker who even though she hides her yearning to get out of the sleaze you can still tell she wants to, heck scratch that, you can tell that she needs to, via her occasional moments of jokiness and solidarity with Travis.<br/><br/>Harvey Kietel and Peter Boyle also make for good support, and even Martin Scorsese is convincingly repulsive as the man who wants to kill his wife and her lover. <br/><br/>2) The story is totally unpredictable and original. The story is just mind-blowing, it is like Paul Schrader pulled it out of a hat or something, or he cut bits of one story, and bits of another and bits of something else and then glued them together to get a story of such brilliance and such suspense. It is this unpredictability that makes it so good. It isn't like an Alien sequel in which you know that half the crew of dick heads will get killed by the creature in some unimaginative way, and somehow one or two will end up killing it, or escaping. Taxi Driver is different in the way in which it is unpredictable and makes for compulsive viewing. <br/><br/>3) The quotes are fantastic. Things like - ""Are you talking to me..."" and others that are quite astounding such as Betsy saying "" You're a walking contradiction.""<br/><br/>This is surprisingly true, DeNiro talks about the sleaze and dirt he hates so much but indulges in porn movies. He claims to hate the trash that clutters the streets but his apartment is still pretty dirty. This revelation of identity is quite good to watch.<br/><br/>4) The film has undertones of comedy, drama, suspense thriller and maybe even horror. It is a funny character study and is unlike anything else I have ever seen.<br/><br/>These are the valid reasons and I think that Taxi Driver deserved more awards than it got, and should go down in history as a true cult classic."

"jboothmillard","10","4","27","12 July 2006"," Taxi Driver
","It has been described as one of his greatest films, and I could agree that this about BAFTA nominated director Martin Scorsese. Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran who has taken a job in New York city as taxi driver because he suffers insomnia. He grows increasingly disgusted by the lowlifes, scum and ""trash"" in the city at night, and this obviously doesn't help his attempt to get somewhere with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who represents the vote for Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), he even takes her to a porn movie on the first date! He fails also to help 12-year-old prostitute Iris (twice BAFTA winning newcomer Jodie Foster) to desert her pimp 'Sport' Matthew (Harvey Keitel). Driven to insanity of powerlessness he buys four handguns and is intent on assassinating the Senator. Donning a Mohawk hairdo he is ready, but when he can't get close enough, he is gunned down in the end after killing Matthew, oh, he didn't die, and he returned to being a taxi driver. Also starring Peter Boyle as Wizard and Albert Brooks as Tom. I think the main reason to see this film (and the most memorable and notable scene) is for the great improvised line when De Niro is talking to himself in the mirror, number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, ""You talking' to me?"". It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Bernard Herrmann and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Harvey Keitel was number 53, Jodie Foster number 23, Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, De Niro was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor, Travis Bickle was number 30 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 47 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","Taxi Driver is one of those few movies that makes you want to watch it again right away. The story is not only well written and fantastic on paper, it is beautifully executed. Martin Scorsese does a fantastic job directing this film, and the shots he manages to create are nothing short of iconic. Everyone remembers the famous scene where Travis Bickle looks in the mirror, but even outside of moments like these the movie has a fantastic sense of where to place the camera for maximum effect. Robert De Niro gives a fantastic and layered performance as Travis which, after your first viewing, will make you want to go back and study the character and his psyche even more. The world of the movie is very dark in tone, and this helps to reflect it's themes beautifully. Overall this movie deserves my highest recommendation and ranks up there with the best."
"Tweekums","9","1","4","18 February 2017"," A classic that is still fresh after over forty years
","This 1976 classic follows Travis Bickle; an insomniac who spends his nights driving a New York taxi. Unlike other drivers he will drive anybody to any part of the city; this leads to him seeing the very worst of the city and he starts to think that something must be done about it. Initially it looks as if that might be joining the campaign for presidential candidate Senator Palantine although he is clearly more interesting in campaigner Betsy. He goes out with her a couple of times but can't see why she won't see him again after he takes her to see a pornographic film! After purchasing a small arsenal he sets about rescuing twelve year old Iris from a life of prostitution; something that leads to a bloody shootout.<br/><br/>This film certainly won't be for everybody; it isn't easy to like our troubled protagonist and he is rarely off screen. Many other characters are even worse; director Martin Scorsese is clearly showing New York as a moral cesspit. Robert De Nero is on top form as Bickle; one of cinema's iconic characters. He makes us believe in Bickle as a real person rather than a caricature. He is brilliantly supported by Jodie Foster as Iris; it is hard to believe that a thirteen year old could give such an impressive performance. This does inevitably leads to some uncomfortable scenes as she offers herself to Bickle. Other notable performances come from Harvey Keitel, who plays Iris's sleazy pimp, and Cybil Shepherd, who plays Betsy. For the most part there isn't much violence; this makes the finale, which is very bloody, all the more shocking. Overall I'd definitely say that this deserves to be considered a classic and would say it is a must see for adult movie fans; just be prepared for some disturbing moments."

Martin Scorscese has proved through this movie that he is one of the finest in Hollywood. Robert Di Nero is totally amazing in his role, his battle with loneliness and sleep deprivation are brilliantly brought on screen. Jodie foster was good as well. The film is set in New York and it beautifully captures the crumbling social structure and racist themes that prevailed in the those times. I saw this movie after I saw David Fincher's 'Seven' and it reminded of that city in that movie quite a bit.

Its realistic portrayal. Its iconic ""You talking to me?"" Or just the fact that it is simply unique and riveting. Taxi Driver is a brilliantly acted film about a psychologically unstable war veteran who is realistically driven to violence due to his loneliness and insomnia. Robert DeNiro delivers a fantastic performance as Travis Bickle, he made you believe he was as lonely as the character he was playing. While Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle and Jodie Foster portrayed just as helpful roles. A majority of the films ranging from the 70s to the 90s were adapted from books, while in this film was originally written by Paul Schrader and directed by Martin Scorsese. In my eyes Taxi Driver is by far the best film in modern cinematic history."

","This is Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese's best movie. Although Scorsese has done better pieces of film, this still surpasses them. De Niro does his best performance and was robbed of his Oscar win. Yes, his performance in better than Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. Raging Bull is Scorsese's best piece of film and De Niro's second best performance.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is one of those movies that are almost biographical as they centre on just one person. Centring on just one person means the character and plot development are going to be very sharp and deep. This is about a former soldier scared from his experiences and gets a job in New York driving a taxi during nights for twelve hours. He falls in love with a girl named Betsy, but the relationship fails. As he keeps slipping into a world of isolation, depression and anxiety, he becomes determined to fix up the streets and make the world better. He plans to assassinate a Senator and save a child (Jodie Foster) from prostitution and her pimp (Harvey Keitel). We see exactly what is in the mind of De Niro as he grows more into a mentally unstable state. What's cool is, he becomes a hero in the process. The American Film Institute ranked Travis Bickle (De Niro) in their list of Top 50 Villains. I don't get why that is. He cleans up the streets and saves a child from prostitution. <br/><br/>This is the second best character study film in history, on after Citizen Kane."
"WadeBLURAYTHEWAY","9","1","4","27 December 2014"," Taxi Driver... one of the best De Niro movies.
","Xmas has just been and this was the movie I was most looking to finally watching. I go this on Blu Ray and sat down with my girlfriend to see this classic I had heard so much about.<br/><br/>Straight away I related to Travis (De Niro), quiet guy, keeps to himself, works hard and he doesn't like what he sees around him. The amount of 'scum' which exist in this world is scary at times and you either do something about it or you don't, Travis as a Taxi Driver sees this on a daily basis, you can see how it bothers him however he can keep a lid on his temper (for a while).<br/><br/>Loneliness is a big part of this movie, Travis explains the hours he works and that would be a nightmare for most people, but not for Travis. He has nobody to see, he has nobody he has to take time out of his day just so he can spend a day or night with. The first attempt he makes at doing this is with Betsy and to his joy it goes well for a couple of dates, but then she leaves him confused, angry and worst of all alone. The scene where Travis decides to purchase weapons and take action is one of my favourites, this is the decisive scene on which Travis decides he's got nothing to lose.<br/><br/>Well to summarise this is right behind Goodfellas for my favourite Scorsese movie, the journey was hard and gritty, you could really feel how Travis felt and then other times you had no idea how he was portraying the events he was seeing. The shootout at the end was brutal and gory, a satisfying ending to the life of the scum which Travis had taken out, but not as satisfying as knowing that Travis would live to fight another day. The hard truth though is what he did was great, but there is thousands more of guys out there like that and there is just no way of fully stopping them. As for De Niro's performance it was a 10/10, he was Travis Bickle that man was as real as you and I. The scene where he pretends to shoot himself as he's bleeding out just shows you what loneliness, depression, society had done to him. Perfectly directed, a tough, rough showing and also a very nicely played cameo from Scorsese as the mad passenger who told Travis about his plans to kill his wife."

Martin Scorsese has brilliantly created a film about morality and kindness existing in the most unexpected places. The cast is top notch and Jodie Fosters performance is flawless and De Niro portrays a mentally ill veteran with ease. The story is very action packed and edgy and the cinematography is very well done. The natural lighting works well and the film has a good score.

"Jacques98","6","1","4","1 February 2009"," The pacing is literally more retarded than the main character.
","In complete opposite mentality of Taxi Driver, no one challenges things anymore. If a movie wins a few Oscars and is labeled as a ""classic"", the title sticks and everyone must bow down to it. If someone challenges this titleeven so much as asks, ""Why is it a classic?""they're ironically turned into a laughable fool by fools laughing. The paradoxical problem with this is that no one can really defend the so-called classics. All you ever hear in the defense of films like Taxi Driver when criticism arises is a list of the film's awards, or a list of the film's critical acclaim, or just, ""It's a classic, so shut up!"" There have been far more original, thought-provoking, well-made movies that never even get the public's attention, much less won overrated Oscars. When people challenge the so-called classics with this fact, the notion is never entertained, and oftentimes foolishly laughed at or stupidly dismissed as childish or immature. With everything I just said as a backbone, I'm about to challenge the ""classic"" Taxi Driver. If you're open-minded you'll give this review a chance. If you have the arrogant mentality of a whiney 4-year-old""It's a classic, that's all there is to it!""then don't even bother reading any further. There is no hope for your immature intellect.<br/><br/>First and foremost, Taxi Driver is not a completely worthless film. I'm not even going to try to argue that. It has had had a major influence on the way open-world movies and video games have been made, and possibly even invented the subgenre. Taxi Driver creates a realistic world, fills it with faceless scum characters, and openly lets the main character interact with them in a completely non-linear way. Some people find this completely boring, others find it completely genius. The entire film is hinged on if or if not you can emotionally relate to the main character. If so, these opening scenes of him interacting with his environment will likely captivate you. If not, these scenes will likely put you to sleepevery single time you attempt to watch it. Stating and argument on whether or not Taxi Driver is boring or not is completely pointless because it's completely opinion-based. Personally, however, I was bored out of my godforsaken mind until the last thirty minutes of the film. Movies have presented loneliness much better, in much more effective ways than this. Another 70s film, Straw Dogs, for example, examines realistic human emotion with much more depth.<br/><br/>DeNiro's acting is average at best, unless you're really studying so closely it's ridicules. If DeNiro wasn't so famous, no one, not a single review, would even mention his acting whatsoever. The character he plays is also completely average. Some people state that he has mental disabilities; if so, I didn't even notice. He was an average, typical, lonely character and nothing more. The majority of his time on screen he's staring at the walls or staring out his windshieldthat's not psychologically deep, it's typical. There is nothing, not one thing, psychologically deep about the main character. It literally makes me laugh every time I hear people calling the character of Travis ""one of the most accurate psychological characters ever portrayed"". If so, Napoleon Dynamite is the next Freud. Neither Travis nor Napoleon do anything whatsoever except stare at things. And we all can learn so much about the human condition from that.<br/><br/>An actual story doesn't even develop until the last thirty minutes of the film. Though it is somewhat nostalgic, it's a pretty typical example of 70s ""shock value"" that is about as shocking to us today as watching a dead tree stump rot. At least it didn't have a cliché, non-graphic rape scene like the hundred other 70s movies just like itI'll give Taxi Driver that credit. The final action scene is PG-13 at worst by today's standards, but it does give some much-needed diversity to the film. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the structure of Taxi driveropen-world, followed by a mini subplotwas a pretty fresh and creative idea for its time. It's almost prolific, considering the thousands of movies and video games that came out after it with the same style. But it's executed terribly here. Travis just repeats the same lines. He never really examines human nature or human behavior. It just gets old fast. The writers could have done so much more with this formula, but their lack of creativity and imagination is absolutely ridicules.<br/><br/>Overall, while the formula Taxi Driver follows is essential, the overall film is bland and forgettable. There were so many missed opportunities to bring true depth and insight into the film, but the writers didn't take them. The lack of any story at all gets very annoying very fast, mainly due to the average main character, played with an average performance. But I guess that is the moral of this non-story that all future directors should take note on: meritocracy wins over the imaginationless critics. And spineless viewers agree with every word they say.<br/><br/>4/10"

"dragonshield","7","1","4","13 June 2007"," One of the best character progressions ever written on screen, though the movie itself being slightly disappointing
","""Taxi Driver"" is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal, but it's good. Like Martin Scorsese's movies usually it is also over-hyped, or at least that's what I think. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but the rating of 8.5 at IMDb is probably a bit too much, it is not that great. The movie tells a story about Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who works as a taxi driver at nights. He is constantly disturbed by the life around him and that gets him mentally unstable. He thinks the streets of New York City are full of trash and by that he is referring to people, and all the injustice and corruption the world around him has. Bickle doesn't have any real friends and he starts to question his own existence, he is lonely and a complete outsider to everyone, failing to make any emotional contact with anyone. The film follows Travis's story's progress from attempts to desperation and it deals with mental issues along with the search of love and happiness.<br/><br/>The best thing this movie has to offer is Robert De Niro, who does an amazing role performance in the role of Travis Bickle. The character itself is very well written as well, so De Niro only had to translate the character on to the screen and he managed that pretty flawlessly. The whole progress of the character is just brilliantly acted out, all the facial expressions and the whole body language changes along the progress in a fantastic way and De Niro makes one of the best role performances he has done this far. It was also pretty interesting to see De Niro in such a ""young"" age, as he was magnificent back then as well, even he actually was 33 years old when the movie was made. The story focuses completely on Travis and there aren't much scenes where he wouldn't be, although there are supporting actors/actresses along the way. The one in the most supporting role is Jodie Foster, who in the age of 14 plays a child prostitute. I was very surprised how good actress she was even back then, in the age of 14! She is so real and performs the role of Iris superbly, I just can't believe she was only 14. Two small parts are played by the legends Peter Boyle (god bless the man) and Harvey Keitel, Boyle in the role ""Wizard"", another taxi driver in New York City who gives advice to Travis and Keitel in the role of ""Sport"", a pimp in New York City who for example sells Iris for money and who Travis just can't stand.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is definitely recognizable as his, as it certainly has that Scorsese touch in it, though I think it is darker than Martin's movies usually. Scorsese always seems to describe violence in a very violent way and he doesn't hide the truth, though sometimes a fictional truth, behind the true violence and other disturbing images. This movie is all in all very disturbing and like Scorsese's movies usually it's also pretty heavy, so the weak minded viewers won't be enjoying it and watching it all the way through. The heaviness is also caused by that slight dullness the movie starts to have after the first hour and it seems like stretched, you keep on watching these irrelevant scenes which don't even matter so much in the end and the movie sadly loses its flow. It does get better towards the end, but there's just this one part of the movie where it seems to stumble a little bit. Maybe I'm being too harsh, so don't slay me because of that, but after all that is just my opinion. The screenplay is pretty much only the building of the main character, the movie is after all a story about Travis Bickle and no-one else. Despite the fact of the screenplay being almost nothing else than the story about the character it still manages to have surprisingly much depth in the plot, which is a very nice thing, as it also drops the heaviness level a little bit.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" offers you a disturbing, yet psychologically clever experience, not forgetting the intelligence it has inside it. Robert De Niro is undeniably the best thing the movie has to offer, so I'm recommending the movie for everyone who is seeking a movie with an astonishing role performance. Like mentioned before this movie isn't for the weak minded, but if you still want to see it then it's your decision and you have been warned. ""Taxi Driver"" is partly all in all interesting, above decent without a doubt and it could be described as an artistic rather than an ordinary movie. So for those who are in search of a light and an easy movie for the Friday evening to watch with a girlfriend, then this isn't for you. It requires concentration and nerves, thinking and collecting pieces of the puzzle afterwards. It's not a phenomenal one, but it's definitely a good one. If all this still doesn't satisfy you, then for god sakes please watch it just because of the experience of seeing the hilarious long dark curly hair Harvey Keitel has in it. Marvellous."
"fedor8","Null","1","4","8 January 2007"," One of the best dramas of all time.
","The best Scorsese/De Niro picture, and that speaks volumes. Though somewhat depressing and very melancholic, this film can be viewed many times, unlike other dramas. A very unusual film in which it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen next, due to the main character's confusion and hence unpredictability. De Niro is perfectly cast, and Keitel and the young Foster are also very good. The soundtrack is excellent and the movie owes a lot to it, as well. The decadence is realistic and captured terrifically by Scorsese; the photography is superb in all its 70s grainy glory.<br/><br/>Now, hang on to your seats!... Before Scorsese took over the project, De Palma and Spielberg were potential directors. Christ Almighty! Thank God they didn't get their hands on this script. Imagine what kind of crap they would have made out of it...<br/><br/>The De Palma version: A lonely Vietnam vet decides to drive a taxi cab for a living, but he has to get to New York first. He travels across the country, and one day decides to spend the night at a motel where a certain Normana Bates works - played by Nancy Allen. While taking a shower on that same evening he is being attacked by Normana with a knife and cut into little pieces. The next morning Normana wakes up, thinking it was all a nightmare and goes into the kitchen to make some coffee. There she is ambushed by a perfectly healthy De Niro, who is holding the same knife he had been butchered with that very night (in the dream; or is it?)! (Makes sense? Not really. It would just get worse from there...:) Allen manages to escape from De Niro in the last moment and drives off to Mount Rushmore. Only hours later De Niro catches up with her and they get involved in a spectacular chase around the four presidential heads. While both of them are hanging on Lincoln's nose (each per nostril) Allen shouts ""Why are you chasing me?"". De Niro responds that he is working for the KGB and must eliminate her for she is an FBI agent who knows too much. Allen then denies any involvement in any spying activities, claiming she is merely a pimp. De Niro asks for proof. Allen opens her mouth to say something when suddenly another Allen appears at the top of Lincoln's head! De Niro and Allen 1 look at each other in disbelief. The mysterious Allen 2 shouts to them that they're both as good as dead. De Niro asks why. Allen 2 says it's revenge for Allen 1 using her daughter as an underage prostitute. De Niro says he had nothing to do with it, and then remembers that he has a fear of heights. He starts panicking. Allen 2 machine-guns him, saves Allen 1, and the two of them get attacked by vicious birds on their way to the motel...<br/><br/>The Spielberg version: A Jewish rabbi - played by Whoopie Goldberg dressed as a man - decides to become a cab driver in order to get in touch with the ""real people"". One of his customers is a small alien with a heart of gold (literally) who is fighting for the rights of whales on his planet, and was sent to Earth by the planet's nasty right-wingers as punishment for his liberal activism. The rabbi offers his help, but not before inviting the alien to a trip to Disneyworld. There the rabbi and the alien meet Mickey Mouse and Goofy, who are more than thrilled to help the alien go back to his planet in time to save the whales. On their way to the Kennedy Space Center they make a dangerous enemy: an unscrupulous pimp - played by Tom Cruise - who will do anything to get the alien laid with one of his 12 year-old girls, simply for the pleasure of being the first intergalactically successful pimp (plus, he wants that golden heart). Cruise is assisted by the evil Republican Party to catch our merry bunch, while the good Democrats - who sing happy songs during the film - do everything to rescue the alien and his friends. The movie ends by the Democrats winning the Congressional, Senate, and Presidential elections and jailing all Republicans while introducing a state-run economy - not to mention helping the alien go back to his planet to save the whales. President Gore gets his life's wish fulfilled when the alien - just before lift-off - gives him advice how to save the spotted owl (the alien: ""Just kill all the humans living near its habitats, and you've saved it."")"

","...not the plot, or anything of that sort!<br/><br/>It actually amazes me that everyone has missed it, so far.<br/><br/>There was once a former U.S. President named Ronald Reagan and a wee, mentally deranged lad named John Hinckley, Junior.<br/><br/>Well, this story rather lives on in infamy and will probably do so for a *very* long time.<br/><br/>http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reagan/peopleevents/pande02.html<br/><br/>---- On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. set out to win actress Jodie Foster's heart. As ""the greatest love offering in the history of the world,"" the 25-year-old attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan outside the Washington Hilton hotel. Though flanked by administration members, police officers, and Secret Service agents, Reagan was shot under the left arm. The bullet malfunctioned and failed to explode on impact, seriously wounding but not killing Reagan.<br/><br/>In Hollywood, Hinckley saw Martin Scorsese's film ""Taxi Driver"" at least 15 times. A confirmed loner, he apparently identified strongly with the Robert DeNiro character Travis Bickle. In the film, Travis is infatuated with Cybill Shepherd's Betsy, a political campaign worker who rejects him after he takes her to see a porn film. To regain Betsy's attention, Bickle plans, but fails, to assassinate the candidate she works for. Bickle then shifts gears, obsessively devoting himself to protecting 12-year-old prostitute Iris, played by Foster. He decides to shoot Iris' pimp, thereby ensuring his status as a hero to Iris and the media.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Paul Schrader based his portrayal of Travis on Arthur Bremer, the would-be assassin of George Wallace whose diaries equate political assassination with celebrity and revenge against impotence and invisibility. Consciously or not, Hinckley began to emulate Bickle, accumulating an arsenal of weapons and fixating on Jodie Foster. Foster would not be his target, but his inspiration: To ""rescue"" her, he began to stalk Jimmy Carter during the 1979 presidential campaign. ----<br/><br/>So, this film is really more notable as a ""fuel for the fire"" (so to speak) than it is for anything else that it may have been intended.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it escaped condemnation, unlike so many other books, recordings and other such ""bad influences"" that are associated with bad deeds done by demented individuals by various organised (or not) groups that work so hard to attempt prosecution, or oppression of those with whom they do not agree, or find offensive.<br/><br/>Such is life. ;-)"

"CubsandCulture","6","1","5","3 November 2019"," Technically polished but ultimately a very ugly film
","I have this problem with a lot of Scorsese films but Taxi Driver is a thoughtful exploration of how a damaged psyche coupled with the Vietnam era violence, just below the surface, of the system, results in self destructive behavior. It deals with how media, capital and the disillusionment with America leads to isolation and alienation, especially for young white men of that time period. And how media narratives reduce such damaged people down to tropes which are often wrong. I see the cinematic influences of the French New Waver-i.e. jump cuts-and the legacy of cinema's past-i.e. this is a twisted noir take on the Searchers-that make the film pop cinematically. And De Niro's performance is extremely well considered. But for all that I simply don't care. I don't care how the techniques are used. And I don't care about the thoughtful exploration. At the end of the day Travis Bickle is the worse of us and while the film does not celebrate him per se I don't find much beauty or sublimity in exploring such figures.<br/><br/>The film is ugly. I don't mean the film is displeasing to the eye, because it largely isn't. (And the sections that are are intentionally displeasing) I don't mean the film is morally abhorrent or treats its subject in a ethically comprised way. I mean at the end of the day this is more a thesis on a certain set of intellectual concerns than an emotive piece of art. It is not an experience. The film is fundamentally malformed as a piece of cinema. This may be a film lover's film but it is not what films are for. I want to be as clear as possible. The film's subject matter is not the issue-MIdnight Cowboy is a very beautiful film that explores related material from roughly the same time period-it is the manner in which Scorsese as intellectualized the material coupled with the darker themes that is the turnoff. This is technically brilliant film making put into service for the worse the cinema has to offer."
"JaydoDre","6","1","5","17 August 2015"," This movie has one of the longest run ups of any story.
","The problem is one of two things: either the first half of the film is meant as a setup for the 2nd half, in which case that is way too long, or the first half of the film is actually meant to be an active participant, in which case it fails. it has a cohesive structure. It has events. It has characters. It has music. But what is the point? Oftentimes it seems there isn't one and it takes a long time for something meaty to arrive. And even the movie's ending is not a full stop.<br/><br/>The film consists of a series of events in the life of a cab driver. Unfortunately, a lot of them are not interesting, even though on paper they should be. Scenes with little content last a good long while and then end in some awkward situation because the main character is mentally and socially unstable. Those scenes are reminiscent of movies like the Midnight Cowboy, an Oscar-awarded movie I would rather go to a dentist than watch.<br/><br/>The film shows the various dirt you see in a city at night, but you can probably see it better yourself if you hang around the streets or watch a documentary. There are a few situations that are interesting, but every time they are followed up by a long nothing. If the long pauses are meant to create tension or accentuate the descent into madness, they fail, creating awkwardness instead. It would appear that the director asks the viewer to do the work and fill in a lot of the blanks instead of doing the effort himself and putting in the sufficient energy.<br/><br/>As Taxi Driver enters its 2nd half, the cerebral content and the tension start seeping in and it gets more and more interesting, but you have to wait almost an hour to arrive at this point. It takes TWO THIRDS of the movie before Jodie Foster's character shows up. The pay-off in the 2nd half of the film feels worth it and the movie makes sense in the end, but it requires a ton of patience from the viewer. It is like a good joke that takes an hour to get to the punch line.<br/><br/>The acting is good as you would expect from Robbert De Niro, but it is also appropriate for the role, which means it is subdued and realistic to the point of boredom. Again, as with the story, there are good moments, most of them in the second half. The camera-work is simple but also brilliant in its simplicity. When the camera movies, there is a real sense of purpose and weight.<br/><br/>The ending is an interesting choice. Without spoiling too much, the problem is that mental sickness doesn't just end with a happy ending, so it is strange to see a rather positive open ending.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is not a movie for me, but the quality is there if you have the patience."

","In theory this film should be a deep psychological study on loneliness, boredom, delusion and depression. However for me it just didn't click and the ending didn't make any sense at all, he shot two guys and was 'rewarded'. Though I understand it was not an action film but analysing one mans demise it was extremely boring and jumped from Travis being relatively sane one minute to him being absolutely nuts the next with no gradual decline. Great idea in theory but overall vastly overrated simply because it has De Niro in it who I thought was OK at best. I actually believe they should of looked far deeper into his mind and habits seeing how they gradually got worse over time. Even the famous line 'you talking to me' is actually done better in parodies than in the actual film. Overall this film has a good concept but just doesn't deliver I believe if it were to be remade it could be a top movie as the idea is fascinating.<br/><br/>Andrew Barbarash"
"shaffreytm","Null","1","5","27 June 2003"," This is NOT a great movie.
","Taxi Driver is a right wing, racist wet dream that Schrader wrote just after the break up of a bad relationship, and he was looking for easy targets.<br/><br/>In the movie, Travis wants to save the white women from those people who, in his mind, have led them astray: he wants to save the Cybil Shepherd character from the liberal political candidates (Palantine, who gives a speech about how the masses suffer for the few) and their Jewish supporters (Albert Brooks). Travis is unable to get close to the politician to shoot him, so he transfers his loneliness into ""saving"" the young prostitute, (Jodie Foster) from the pimp (originally written as a black man), who, defying all case studies of runaways in real life, was somehow running away from a safe loving family back in Pittsburgh. This is not a great movie. I've never understood why it was popular, except for, I suppose, DeNiro's intensity. If this what the supposedly ""free"" filmmaking of the 70s was all about, you can count me as one whose glad that era is over."

","Okay, I have very much respect for the genius of Martin Scorcese, but I really can't see what this movie is all about.  I have seen it only once, but I feel that that is enough to get the overall view of this particular flick.  ""Taxi Driver"" should have been called, ""The Psychotic And Detrimental Effects Of Living In The City And Actually Caring About The World In Which We Live.""  Now, I know that this is exactly what this movie is about, but I don't see the genius in making a movie about it.  The classic scene with DeNiro and his gun (""Are you looking at me?"") is just that...classic.  It shows the level to which his character has descended...he is now in a world where nothing else really matters...his revenge against a world and a system that has screwed him and everyone he meets and sees over too many times.  I got a tad bit lost towards the end and I thought that I was watching a documentary about the negative effects of working in a postal office too long.  I don't know, maybe if I watched it again I could find the hidden qualities and secrets that I seem to have missed on the first viewing.  But for now, I would have to rate ""Taxi Driver"" with Scorcese's other horrid movie, ""U-turn.""  But that is another paragraph or so.             Ciao, Clyde."

","Martin Scorsese made far better films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" and ""Goodfellas."" They have actual narratives and the plots make sense. ""Taxi Driver"" has a confusing narrative and the ending left me annoyed as it wasn't clear what the ending was meant to be! Robert DeNiro - who has made some good films - is well cast as the mentally disturbed Vietnam veteran who gradually loses touch with reality. The way he begins to come loose at the seams - psychologically speaking - is quite disturbing. Martin Scorsese's direction is very good on the whole. As witnessed in previous films from the decade, we are given a truly honest look at city life in New York. The dirty, trashy streets and the dirty, trashy people all contribute to the look of the film and also the way that Travis Bickle (DeNiro) views the world. The violence is explicit, which I except. After all, a film like ""Taxi Driver"" can't be glossed over with ""comic strip"" violence. What I don't particularly care for, is the language. It isn't difficult for actors to use all the 4 letter words they can think of and this partly defeats the film. I cringed on occasion at some of the foul language used and the manner in which it was intended. It is the climax that ultimately lets ""Taxi Driver"" down. Somehow, I doubt whether such events would have finished that way in real life. This is a misfire but an interesting misfire."

","Director Martin Scorsese uses harsh reality and memorable characters to perfection. Robert de Niro plays a slightly deranged Viet Nam vet that drives a NYC cab at night. His insomnia appears relentless and he spends a lot of his time in porno theaters. This lonesome loser does have a heart buried beneath that rough and hardened exterior. Driving his taxi allows him to see through his eyes the underbelly of the city and confirms his contempt for the ""scum"" all around him. So memorable is his working up to date the beautiful Cybil Shepard only to p*ss her off by taking her to a porno flick. Then trying to ""rescue"" a 12-year old runaway turned prostitute(Jodie Foster)and dealing with her sleazy pimp(Harvey Keitel). A stomach-churning bloodbath seems to be an unconditional cleansing of a very personal hell. Also in the cast are:Leonard Harris, Albert Brooks and Peter Boyle. This great movie is just a building block towards Scorsese's genius."

Travis feels like he needs to save both the women he adores: Betsy is ""in danger"" by the world of politics and iris is in danger by all the gangsters around her. eventually he saves only iris from the world of crime, which seems logical but in travis's point of view he needs to do more, that's why in the ending Travis hasn't changed, he is still going to take matters into his own hands and it is question of time when will he ""explode"" again. scorsese, you nailed it again."

","It is strange to think that it has been 44 years since Taxi Driver's release. In comparison, Taxi Driver came out 37 years after Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. I think it's fair to say that Taxi Driver belongs on a short list of American films that are cultural touchstones-movies (like those two 1939 classics) that you must be familiar with to be culturally literate; although, Taxi Driver still seems astonishingly relevant and much more modern after 44 years than the 1939 pictures felt in 1976.<br/><br/>The theme of isolation especially resonates today. And the story's fable-like aspects give it a simple, timeless quality. The plaintive Bernard Herrmann score evokes a calmer, more innocent era. The neon and lighted marquees slide by in a blur or are reflected in multi-colored puddles. Steam rises from manhole covers like dragon's breath. Travis is an innocent, albeit a troubled one, and finds his city scary despite all the bright lights. In his mind he is on a Hero's Journey, beset with enemies all around, to rescue a maiden. Or something like that. The poor guy has some tangled ideas about women. And he has no allies to help him navigate this strange world. You feel very sorry for him. But, of course, he's very dangerous.<br/><br/>The historical relevance is well documented. Screenwriter Schrader drew inspiration from diaries of Arthur Bremer, who shot George Wallace in 1972. In 1981, John Hickley-an obsessive watcher of the film-tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan to impress Jody Foster. I find it interesting that all three men didn't really care who they killed. Bremer had also stalked Nixon, and Hickley, Carter. Travis didn't care either. He wasn't looking for fame like his real-life counterparts, though, he was just addled and isolated and enraged. But that's a type that's all too familiar today.<br/><br/>Considering the endless stories of mentally ill shooters that we listen to now, it appears that Taxi Driver predicted what was coming. I don't think the filmmakers were going for that; it was probably more historical when it was written-the Texas Tower spree killings occurred 10 years earlier as well as several assassinations and attempts. But as it was one of the first films to explore this type of character, it turned out to be prescient. And depressing. But that's what it is: a depressing work of art."

","Taxi Driver is a movie that a lot of people have talked about and for good reason. It's a properly good film, working superbly as both a character study of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran with a plan to purge the wrongs in society, and as a testament to the rising crime rate and urban decay in New York in the '70s, the very same rising crime rate and urban decay that incenses Travis. Travis's journey is our plotline. At the film's onset he is seemingly unemployed and so, knowing the city well, goes and becomes a taxi driver. On a date with Betsy (Cybill Shepard) a pretty campaign worker with whom Travis is infatuated, she remarks that he is a ""walking contradiction."" And certainly this characterization is an apt one. When applying for the job Travis seems normal. A little awkward maybe, but nothing out of the ordinary. At least not too out of the ordinary. And his disaffection with high crime, prostitution, and garbage strewn about the city streets is one that many people can agree with. Even his goal of saving Iris Steensma (Jodie Foster) from her situation is a noble one. Martin Scorsese keeps the movie set in Travis's world view, a world view which never really changes. Travis's mental state and perception of reality don't so much change as they simply worsen. It's a very gradual shift so we hardly realize it's happening up until Travis makes a botched attempt to assasinate Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is volunteering. After that his massacre of a brothel, his final deluded attempt to clean up the city, is only natural. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and remedy that."

","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a great character analysis and brought to life by a fantastic performance by Robert De Niro. Taxi Driver paints an extremely disturbing portrait -- we find ourselves understanding Travis' mindset. This is expert film making from Scorsese, cinematographer Michael Chapman, and the actors. Schrader's script, which was inspired by such diverse works as Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground and Harry Chapin's song, ""Taxi,"" is a masterful psychological study, the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings. Even though more than 4 decades have passed since the film's release there is nothing dated about Taxi Driver. The message still rings as true as ever, and the characters are as shockingly believable as in the mid-seventies. The ending is a shocker to the psyche- Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Travis into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen."

The first is the New York fiscal crisis, that came to a head in 1975 and continued through the late seventies. The second is the impact of the Vietnam war and particularly the My Lai massacre on the collective American psyche.<br/><br/>Both of those topics are too weighty and complex to do justice in something as trivial as a film review, so you're gonna hafta do the footwork yourself. And no, they didn't teach 'all that' at school because what you learnt there was the tripe they feed you so you grow in to a compliant citizen.<br/><br/>-*-<br/><br/>This one of those films that's actually as deep and complex as it's often touted to be by those half wit film critics who're so easily bluffed by pseudy film makers. It's like this through a combination of circumstances, Scorsese delivers a narrative that is filtered through the audiences own imagination that is implicit rather than revealed through exposition. It works because of the rare commitment of De Niro and others, presenting a narrative open to interpretation.<br/><br/>That's not a particularly rare device in film making, Mike Leigh is does that a lot, the theory goes: you give the audience realistic but nebulously defined characters, if they're real enough we, the audience, can project on to those characters, by such means we're able to relate to them. But Scorsese's narrative is also stylised, he bookends the narrative, with the image of a mutilated hand conveyed by different characters who're the mirror image of each other, Tom and the Mafioso. Iris and Betsy they're the same but different, they're not victims but in places they don't want to be both seduced by someone unscrupulous, the pimp and the dissembling politician. We're forced to examine both ends of the social scale, the child abusing pimp and the indifference of the privileged ascendancy.<br/><br/>Travis is a character who it seems is persistently passing judgement on others, the junkies, the pimps etcetera but is that what's really happening? He buys his guns from Easy Andy and kills a thief without reflection He's a man in deep trouble, in need of help but he finds himself alone, isolated from any means of assistance. The weeks or months of insomnia are taking their toll, this sleeplessness is it something to do with Vietnam? And why have his workmates dubbed him Killer?<br/><br/>Hero or villain, it's all about perspective, kill a politician and you're a bad boy, do the same to a pimp and you're a hero. The fact that the politician probably did more to facilitate the evil inflicted by the pimp is lost in the narrative, now there's a social critique to ponder.<br/><br/>-*-<br/><br/>Finally for some reason I find confusion often expressed about the language used by the interviewer when Travis applies for the job as a driver, ie: 'If you're gonna break my chops, you can take it on the arches. Understand?'. Let me explain, having your chops broken, is something an underling might experience when being admonished by a superior, the interviewer is being slightly ironic here as he transposes the roles. 'Take it on the arches' is a reference for the administration of corporal punishment during the intuition of slavery. Slaves would have their feet beaten with heavy sticks, so that they would continue to suffer pain as they tried to walk on their feet. The interviewer is literally telling Travis to, beat his feet."

","""Loneliness has followed me my whole life.""<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that has no real plot. The story tracks Travis Bickle as he drives his taxi through New York City. As the film progresses, we learn more about Bickle and how his loneliness slowly drives him to madness.<br/><br/>I understand why people like this movie so much. There's nothing bad about it at all. The music and writing are incredible. Right from the get-go the music sets the mood for the rest of the film. The direction is great too, and I think a cab driving down the streets of New York provides Scorsese countless opportunities to show off. The main highlight of the film is Robert De Niro, a man born to play Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>Normally I like character-centered movies like this one, but Taxi Driver just never settles in for me. I don't hate the movie, but I don't love it like many folks do. I feel that the movie drags a bit. I understand that there are many meanings, some ambiguous, but I think the movie could have used a bit more psychological terror. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments (i.e. De Niro shaving his head and the hallway scene), but I was hoping for a bit more.<br/><br/>Again, I think this is a well-executed film, I was just hoping for it to resonate more with me.

","An old acquaintance named Ira was a cab driver. I wanted to know what it was like driving a cab for one shift so I gave it a try. This was not the life for me. Belligerent customers and horrible tippers were the norm. Some patrons liked the air conditioning on high. Others made me turn it off. Impromptu traffic snarls and pot holes drove me crazy. Went to see this movie with my friend Neil during my college years and why not, It features violence, sex and foul language. Filmed on location in and around New York's majestic Manhattan streets, (displaying familiar landmarks) i.e. Time Square, Bellmore Cafeteria. But the main focus of the film exposes the underbelly world of prostitution, mainly sex trafficking. Sleazy hotels and rows of movie houses showing sex films along 42nd street of the 1970's. Conversely the film shows us the disconnect with the politics of the time featuring a political campaign. Robert DiNiro play Vietnam Veteran Travis Bickle who is basically a loner looking for employment. Travis lands a job as a New York City cab driver. The cinematography (Michael Chapman) is of excellent quality showing steam coming up from the streets as our yellow cab slashes through water puddles giving it a feel of realism. The camera gives you a sense of actually riding in the backseat of Travis's cab. I know like most passengers who have ridden in cabs, we focus on the meter as we watch the numbers tick higher as the ride progresses. I don't ever remember a movie featuring a taxi meter before. Basically you see the diverse cliente Travis picks up in his cab from violent pimps to a squeaky clean cut politician. Travis, though lonely, is bold enough to ask a extremely attractive political campaign staff member Betsy (Cybill Shepard) on a date which fails. Travis goes one step further in a different direction as he intercedes an underage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis explains that this is no life for a 12 year old and that her pimp named Sport (Harvey Keitel) only has bad intentions for her. Iris is not influenced by Travis' remarks in the least. Travis takes matters into his hands as he purchases weapons and ads deadly devices to insure severe torture. Travis's loneliness manifests itself during the film with rage and anger. The mirror scene is an iconic moment in cinematography history. Travis (DiNiro), is the narrator. Travis voices his negativity about the city through most of the picture. The film predictably ends up to a crescendo of violence the viewer will never forget . Kudos for the musical background provided by Bernard Herrmann with ever present saxophone sounds throughout. Just one of those movies you just can't get out of your mind as it's value remains the same after all these years. A timeless piece from Martin Scorcese."

"jackamccallum","9","0","1","29 May 2019"," Scorsese's Analysis of Masculinity, Unchecked Aggression, Violence and a Psychopath
","Taxi Driver may be one of cinemas best character studies. The story follows Travis Bickle a Vietnam veteran now employed as a taxi driver in New York City who thinks the world has gone to hell and needs to be cleansed by someone like him through violence. Robert De Niro in one of his best performances plays Travis like a ticking time bomb who off go off at any moment. He is aggressive, cynical and craves violence. De Niro uses both subtlety and occasional spontaneous outbursts to show the audience Travis's mental state and to communicate that this is not a man to aspire to. Scorsese uses the camera expertly with it acting as almost and observer judging Travis. He uses clever and interesting angles to hint towards Travis's violent cravings (most noticeably the first person perspective when Travis aims a gun out the window and the glance in the rear view mirror at the end of the film). Scorsese creates a seedy and dirty version of New York City with literal piles of trash on side walks in some scenes in the movie with prostitutes and pimps as side characters. Taxi Driver is a shocking film that is expertly acted by Robert De Niro and Directed by Martin Scorsese in one of their many collaborations together. The film is intense, brutal and violent at times but that is exactly how one would describe Travis."
"collegegirl5180","8","0","1","17 May 2019"," The start of DeNiro?
","This film takes the classic ""taxi"" and spins it to demonstrate much greater issues going on during this time period, and still occurring today. Throughout this film, the taxi is the center of the film, and the camera often focused on up-close shots of the taxi, and allowed the rest of the surrounding area to drift by, similar to how Travis Bickle feels within the film. Most of the shots in this film are slow, ironic because the life of a taxi driver is quick. The deliberate shots emphasize the loneliness felt by Bickle, and his separation from society. The lighting is also strictly placed to emphasize the busyness around the taxi, but the stillness and darkness felt from inside ."

So yes Travis Bickle is a legendary classic movie character who i personally can identify with.<br/><br/>The sleazy crime filled gutter called New York City of the 70's is gritty & raw on screen & with all the hussle & bussle you can see how Travis would be completely lost in this grimy city of sin.
The music is beautiful & the night time world that Travis is cruising around in is captured beautifully with it's glowing neon signs & colourful backgrounds very neo-noir with a touch of urban gothic Horror in a way.

"RemoteViewing","10","0","2","11 May 2019"," One of The Best
","Taxi Driver is an interesting film. Featuring some gruesome violence that one expects when watching a Scorsese film, Taxi Driver doesn't go out of its way to try and sugar coat the reality of its world to the viewer. You get a slow build up to the overwhelming dread that this world presents, leading to the audience, at the very least, understanding the actions that Travis performs at the end of the film. The film really builds up to Travis' failed assassination of a presidential candidate, but that's not the most enjoyable part of the film's climax. Travis goes to ""save"" a young prostitute in a plan which ends in a bloodbath, almost ending in his death (after an attempted suicide of course.) This scene ends with one of my favorite shots of all time, as the action freezes and the camera slowly pulls out from the scene in a bird's eye view which gives the audience time to reflect on not only the horrific scene that just unraveled before them, but also the events that led up to this tragic point. Even better than that, is the ending, which states, in no uncertain terms, that the world views Travis' actions as just. They know not of his attempts at horrendous deeds, so they hold him up as a hero. What's worse, is the film shows that Travis has no plans on stopping. Truly of masterpiece of storytelling, with excellent cinematography to only enhance the viewing experience."
"owengoldstoff","10","0","2","8 May 2019"," A perfect neo-noir
","Taxi Driver is a spectacular neo-noir, psychological drama. To me, what really made it noir, was the fact that the story is told in the form of a diary of a man who is losing his mind. Even parts without narration can feel this way too, such as when Travis is in his apartment, using a mirror to practice pulling a gun on people. He repeats the saying, ""You talking to me?"" This is Scorsese's way of showing Travis' inner demons are eating away at sanity, and the camera being pointed at his reflection shows that he is only hurting himself. The dim greens, yellows, and browns, and the overall seediness of his apartment's interior almost make you feel like you trapped inside his mind. It's one of films that will keep you uncomfortably drawn in the entire time, as the anxiety of how things will turn continue to build up."

"avanjit-20257","9","0","1","19 April 2019"," A Simple Personal Comment for Mr. Scorsese.
","Taxi Driver is straight-out a neo-noir movie.
The reason I so consistently emphasize on this matter is because of the fact that it actually is, from the mystery-defining soundtrack to the whole concept of fighting a city crime in a sort of a straight-out bang-bang gun fashion is something that you would only see in a noir movie. Of course it's not black and white but, in all other directions, it's a noir movie.
Now the thing about this movie is that it is as personal as it can get to the life of a Taxi Driver, who happens to be played so naturally by De Nior as though you forget for a time-being, what great stature is on the screen and even for that matter, any other well-known actor who appears on the same screen within the elapsed time of the movie has even lesser value of a Hollywood-cultural specific preliminary existence.
My point is that, the movie revolves around the single most important character and his name is Travis Bickle who is kinda like a misfit among the group of people that he's normally seen to be associating with in the movie. To differ with this, as though in a way, to be contradicting this way of life of a regular taxi driver is Travis whose beliefs that whatever a man's occupation may be, he is at least entitled to do whatever he likes as long as it's right by one's own moral standards. This in a way gives him the courage at the first half of the movie to pursue a girl that he feels is the most beautiful thing in the world.
And as far as the script goes, I'd say it can be certified as an A-class script as for its precision to show exactly what kinda fellow Travis Bickel is and what his true intentions are.
The structure of the script is what I would call ""A consistent trip along the highway and while on the way, taking few worthwhile side tracks and a turn-over.""
The taxi driving sequences become the whole 'highway trip thing' while 'side tracks' refers to indulging on various other activities which are not similar yet are all inter-connected to each other, and the 'turn-over' refers to the point where he loses his girl due to an unfortunate side-track trip. Well that's a lot of analogy.
Coming back to the way things work in the movie, I also like the way the movie builds gradually around the character and also the way the character builds around the events that follow in the movie which when chronologically put together is just the consequence of one another.
Also in particular, I'd like to point out the fact that the way the crime-fighting or more of a bang-bang scene ended with a wide shot of the whole lot of gathering people felt like an homage to the late great movie ""Chinatown"" by Roman Polanski."
"MonkyMangler","10","0","1","9 April 2019"," There's a Travis Bickle in all of us
","Taxi Driver is a rare example of how to tell a story through the eyes of the protagonist/antagonist. There's many ways to interpret this film and what it all meant depending on who you are. Some have viewed the character Travis as a psychotic gunman to a misunderstood hero. The film itself is excellent and easily makes it into my top 3, and the reason why is not just the acting, cinematography, style, or the well developed characters. This film did more then that, it stuck with me on a personal level. Never once in a movie have i ever related to someone like Travis Bickle. And i think i relate to him so much because he is just like you or me. I'm pretty sure we've all been at a point where our anger and rage reaches to a boiling point and we wish to act upon it, but our morals and better judgement usually stop us. We want acceptance from our peers and society in general, but when we don't achieve that we are then angry at the world. These feelings are perfectly represented with Travis Bickle. No person is safe from insanity. If pushed far enough you could one day become Travis. Whether or not you think Travis is a Hero or Villain, the Ending was a dream or reality, i think a majority of us can agree that Travis Bickle is a complex and well written character and everyone who worked on this film went above and beyond to bring us a film that forever engraved itself into movie history."

","Taxi Driver is Scorcese's early period, which is notable for bleak movies full of unlikeable losers. As opposed to his big-budget phase in which his movies are bombastic, overblown, and full of loud a##h#les.<br/><br/>DeNiro brings the psycho intensity. Jodie Foster is quite amazing for her age. And Cybil Shepherd - vavoom! - was there a more beautiful actress working in the 70s.<br/><br/>The repetitive score got on my nerves. And the entire movie could easily have been brought in at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>However, that's not my biggest beef. Scorcese presents us with Travis Bickle, a disaffected, scrambled-egg vet who drives cabs to chase away insomnia, stalks a beautiful girl, gets rejected, and loads up on guns & ammo just in case he needs it to clean the scum off the streets. Fine, I'll play along. But when he fails at his primary target he goes on a tawdry shooting spree and ends up with a hole in his neck.<br/><br/>The final scene should be the crane shot of Bickle unconscious on the couch as the camera pans out of the room and on to the street. Bickle dead. The end. The typical Hollywood gun-p#rn story where the violence-fetishizing ex-military psycho dies at the end, just another American loser unredeemed in death.<br/><br/>But no. There's more. We get a final, highly improbably scene where he's obviously admired by his fellow cabbies, fully healed physically and psychologically, even though in real life nobody with any sense would get within 15 feet of the guy because he'd be a scrambled-brain triple-murderer. And then, to add insult to injury, who hails a ride but the beautiful blonde who rejected him earlier. She makes moonfaces at him like he's a rock star, and ultimately he drives away, leaving her alone on the curb.<br/><br/>What are we to make of this? Are we to admire Bickle - gun-loving, violent, psycho loser - for he is now big man on campus? That he can save the h##ker, murder with impunity, and get the beautiful clean upper-class blonde girl if he chose? The whole thing is so obnoxious.<br/><br/>The only mystery to me is that the psycho loser who tried to shoot Reagan became obsessed with Foster and not Shepherd. That would have been more in keeping with the story.<br/><br/>Scorcese is surely the most over-rated hack in contemporary Hollywood. All his movies are slick and professionally made, but ultimately empty, with little redeeming value other than the glorification of vice, esp gun violence."

It has this uneasy morbidness and hypnagogic tone covered throughout and although I think the movie has definitely aged, it still is as compelling to watch and relate to in this day and age.

","Taxi Driver (1976), Martin Scorsese is the story of a Vietnam veteran as he falls under an overpowering desire to be a ""hero"" influenced by several negative sources in his life.

The cinematography in the film is truly exceptional, and Scorsese does a fantastic job of keeping the viewer engaged with some truly creative camera-work and shots. The acting is also excellent and young De Niro, as well as the supporting cast, all give great performances. I also found the soundtrack of the movie notable in it's excellence and support of the films atmosphere.

","If you don't mind watching the inner recesses of an unhappy and mentally deranged man closely and unflinchingly then Taxi Driver will serve as the best film to offer as such. I never read Paul Schrader's novel and I don't believe it has to be a prerequisite for appreciating the content of Taxi Driver. Martin Scorcese, one of our legendary and best directors of our time, is reliable and competent enough to be faithful to the novel. And he doesn't fail. Thus follows the drab, difficult, sad and paranoid life of ex-marine, Travis Bickle, played by none other than Robert Deniro. This is the young Deniro, lean, hard and wiry. We don't know much about Travis other than he's been honorably discharged from Vietnam services within the past two years. He suffers a bit of PTSD due to his withdrawn and socially inept personality. He doesn't have any friends nor family apparently and just hustles as a New York Cab driver. I remember first learning about Taxi Driver at the time John Hinckley made the assassination attempt on President Reagan. There was a parallel with that story and Hinckley was inspired to carry out his insane plan to no avail other than being pilloried as a mental case worthy of ridicule and scorn. But I hadn't watched Taxi driver till I was in high school and didn't grasp all the details. Perhaps anticipating the long awaited violence to the end didn't satisfy my young appetite for the gratuitous. But Taxi Driver, despite its unappealing continuity, is a masterpiece. it's a cinematic masterpiece due to our brilliant realized performance of our main actor and the meticulous direction of Scorcese. <br/><br/>Travis Bickle is not just a loner, but a self imposed loner who wallows in his own self pity, disdain for society, and his inability to form relationships. Travis sees himself as a victim rather than someone who needs to change his attitude. Strangely enough, as the plot progresses, we see he has a sensitive wisdom about the world at large and his brief interactions with people that many of us can relate to. Martin Scorcese ingeniously captures moments of Deniro within the context of his own drab existence such as his dumpy apartment flat, his nuances in the cab, his pathetic attempts to charm women and Travis' overall lack of mental and social sophistication. This is not just a man who sees the outside world objectively instead of personally, he grows increasingly paranoid with his everyday job, observing decadence, street prostitution, drug trafficking and the menial activity right at the urban core of New York City. I will not talk in depth about the shocking last minutes of graphic violence, but they are shot very effectively. The scene looks very macabre and disturbing. Much debate and discussion has been given to this film in terms of psychoanalysis, moral interpretation and artistic evaluation. I don't think this is Marty Scorcese's best film. I don't think this is Robert Deniro's best performance. But they are nonetheless intense and remarkable. The iconic scene where Deniro looks into the camera and confronts us, ""You talking' to me?"" scene is always a favorite and surely captures the persona and inner contemplative rage of a man descending into darker spiritual realms. He's crazy yet controlled. He's dangerous yet serene, like a grenade about to explode.<br/><br/>The film is a marvel throughout, playing with camera angles, camera moves, pacing, lighting, subtle acting moments and tempo that truly get us in touch with this character and how he is affected by those around him. The only two aspects i didn't care for were the musical score and the casting of Jodie Foster. I thought the Jazz saxophone was just too banal for this type of film. It didn't add to the suspense in any way, but rather mollified it which was inappropriate. They needed more frenetic sounds and music to enhance the growing sense of unease and fear. As for Foster, there were several other actresses considered for Iris: Mariel Hemingway, Eve Plumb, Carrie Fisher and Linda Blair. each of these women were better suited for this role and could have done a much better job of portraying the beautiful innocence required for the character. Foster is too asexual, blunt and not innately sexy enough to be believable. I felt this ruined the picture.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver has etched its way in movie history and should be required viewing for all film buffs and those who can delve into deep psychoanalytic character studies."

","Another seminal classic that's been discussed way beyond the point of my input being of any importance. What I will say though is this- if you don't get the hype around either Scorcese or De Niro, then let this change your mind. For me, the real strength of this film is its unrelenting darkness- it's a true horror film in my view and, as a character study, I think it's one of the finest pieces of cinema that I've seen to date. Also, a quick shout out to the score which provides a gritty jazz backdrop which only serves to further the chill that this film will leave you with. Why not a perfect 10? I'd say that the film is pretty slow-paced and, whilst the payoff more than delivers, you may find your patience tested a little bit in the meantime."

","Even though it's a decade after the beginning of the ""counterculture"" movement we see in films, this one still is a representative of that, even if only a minor one. This film we have Travis, a taxi driver. And one never really thinks about it, but we've all done or said something of a private nature with a sense of security when in truth we weren't alone. So a taxi driver, for example, anyone can hail him, so he has exposure to virtually anyone from all different walks of life and belief systems. A quote from the film is, ""People do anything in front of a taxi driver, I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room. People who want to embarrass you, it's like you're not even there. It's like, you know, a taxi driver doesn't even exist"" , and ""This city is like an open sewer. You know, it's full of filth and scum He's seen the worst of it. And he does this job everyday. He's had enough and sees a need for a change. When talking to Iris, a child prostitute he tries to save, when planning to assassinate a presidential candidate, where he says ""no"" to going with her somewhere, he says, ""Doing something for the government"".

","This was a very intense film. I don't know if I can say I really loved it. All of the violence does not sit well with me, even in a film. However, Travis was trying to do good in the messed up world he was a part of, and sometimes he got lost along the way. He was obviously experiencing some type of psychological stressor, most likely depression. The film did show a lot of ugly truths about the world we live in, something more people need to be aware of and realize- we do not live in a perfect pretty world. There are ugly things that happen even in our very own neighborhoods that we would much rather turn a blind eye to. Travis was almost unable to turn a blind eye though, because as a taxi driver, Travis is exposed to a lot of the raw world and people in it."

Robert De Niro is perfect as Travis Bickle, an ex-marine with a split personality, the dark one, in which, is about to be let out of the cage. ""Taxi Driver"" is one of those rare occasions when just watching the main character do his thing on screen can solely make the film a pure masterpiece. Besides some great character development, this film does not really have much to do, unless you are looking in between the lines. This is a very intelligent film that I just could not take my eyes off of. By the end, you will not be disappointed. Tense, at times witty, and sometimes downright brutal. This film is brilliant!"

"Screen_Blitz","10","0","2","3 April 2016"," A stunning masterpiece by Martin Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese has made a name for himself in Hollywood, and with his directorial efforts in the classic films like 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', and 'Casino', it's not hard to see why. Scorsese is a man with a God-given talent in directing and writing, especially those pitted in the crime genre. This bleak crime-drama starring his most collaborator Robert De Niro is the film that really put in Scorses in the cinematic spotlight during the early years of his career. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally disturbed Vietnam War veteran living in the crowded streets of New York City. In the efforts to deal with his insomnia, Bickle takes a full-time job as a cab driver. Along the way, he meets a political campaign worker Betsy (played by Cybill Shepard) who he develops a relationship with. On the night of a botched date, their relationship fails to work out. Even worse, Bickle grows increasingly disillusioned by the crime and corruption in society, and he learns of a 12-year old girl named Iris (played by Jodie Foster) being a sex slave of a local pot-smoking low-life named Sport (played by Harvey Keital), Bickle decides he must take matters into his own hands and make a stop to his madness. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese puts directorial compelling efforts in the film, as does Robert De Niro as the main character who immediately grabs your attention when he is first introduced. The film takes viewers on a journey through the mind of a mentally disturbed war veteran has taken serious offense to the cruelty and corruption going on in our society, and the story progresses through how it affects him as a person to where he transforms from an average New York City guy to a anger-fueled gun-wielding vigilante who does not take crap from anyone. This leads into some dark and shocking scenes that always keep the film the moving, particularly during its aggressive climax. Robert De Niro serves as the pinnacle of this film with his arresting performance, and the intense conviction he brings his character is more than enough to make his character believable and someone you do not want to be on the bad side of. By today, this is easily stands as one of his landmark roles of his career. Jodie Foster who was only 13 at the time is quite good what was her debut role in her career. Then Harvey Keital who plays Sport, the low-life pimp who forces Jodie Foster's character into prostitution is very strong with his performance, putting well effort into such a creepy and utterly deranged character who will have viewers rooting for justice brought upon his madness. The characters are incredibly well written and developed with pride. Another interesting gem comes from the cinematography. The imagery of nighttime New York City soaking with neon lights is outstanding and beautiful to look at, especially for a 70s picture. <br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a profound masterpiece by Martin Scorsese, and one of the most cinematic achievements to this day. Robert De Niro is thoroughly irresistible in his role, and shows why he is the brilliant actor many know and love today. Martin Scorsese may have some new films in store in the future, none of them will ever measure up to this. Scorsese is a filmmaker who many can find deeply admirable and his works show a powerful demonstration."
"sharky_55","10","0","2","2 April 2016"," The papers always blow these things up...
","Bernard Herrmann's score for Taxi Driver has two distinct, recurring elements to it which Rosenbaum call 'heaven' and 'hell'. The latter is that ominous, brooding brass heavy tune that pumps up again and again as the taxi glides through the darkness of New York City like Charon's ferry through the River Styx. It thuds and blares in time with Bickle's heartbeat and pursed-eyed glare as he surveys the filth and scum around him - the city's terrors come alive in the soundtrack, hisses of machinery and auto-mobile, gusts of steam erupting from the ground, water whipping up a blurry haze from inside the taxi's POV. And the former is that romantic jazz influenced saxophone fill that feels like it could be plucked from Woody Allen's Gershwin-inspired love letter to his favourite city, but here it is steeped in irony. In the final sounding of this motif, the camera hovers over the 'happy' ending for Travis - the tiny little newspapers clippings branding his heroism, the narration of Iris' parents' gratitude, lingering on Betsy's admiring glances at the now celebrated figure. These two elements clash again and again like they are fighting for control of the narrative; Travis' own paranoia and disintegration of his mind muddle it further.<br/><br/>He is a Vietnam veteran and feels disillusioned by the state of the city he lives in. Haven't we all once felt the same sort of loathing for elements out of our control - a rubbish heap dumped in the middle of nowhere, homeless slumming in the streets, violence ringing in our ears. But we at least have the capacity to deflect, to avert our gaze and move on. Travis cannot turn away - he soaks and absorbs each incident he sees, and though he claims insomnia and a hatred for all the city's night goings that lead to him cleaning cum and blood off his back seat, he drives and drives and drives, like an addict who cannot stay away, and Scorsese magnifies each transgression in his eyes with a hazy slow-motion effect and uses Chemtone so each nightmarish spot of darkness on the streets leaks into open spaces. <br/><br/>Schrader has written what others have described as a 'walking contradiction' - Bickle's addled mind makes frightening justifications in between his rather sane lapses. Ignoring the same disregard for the filthy prostitution business on the streets he regularly visits porno theatres - alone, you might add. In a city filled with millions of people he cannot make a connection. The identification of Betsy as a pure, white angel in a midst of black filth goes beyond sexual desire but as a metaphorical release from the setting - the romantic theme will then chime in, like a heavenly accompaniment lifting their connection beyond earthly pleasures (Herrman later uses these harp glissandos to indicate the same sort of ascension). But reality does not match this daydream of Bickle's. De Niro's performance excels not only because of his manic terror but in the quieter moments, his brief lapses of social understanding. The jokes hit a lull in the conversation, and disappear into awkward silence. The nervy, blank smile almost betrays his thoughts along with a tendency for his whole body to shiver with anticipation of his martyrdom. And in his feeble desperation at losing a rare connection, Scorsese pans away to an empty corridor because the state of Bickle is too embarrassing to behold. <br/><br/>The genius of Scorsese and Schrader is the sympathy they evoke from such a dangerous, loathing and psychotic individual. There is a spirited montage of him getting into shape, honing his marksmanship, and that infamous scene in the mirror that has been homaged countless times. The loneliness leaks through the tough, jaded exterior. And there are opportunities too, for him to relinquish the saviour role he has branded himself with, but which no person like Travis Bickle would take. The softly-spoken advice from a fellow cabbie, or that suggestive glance from Betsy that serves as his end redemption (which is a deliberate nod to the insanity of the perception of his crime - imagine how she would react had his assassination been successful). But he has killed the right people, so to speak, and is heralded for it whilst not truly finding satisfaction. Each of Chapman's compositions serve his increasing, nagging desire to clean the streets - even in the beginning as he applies for his license, his gaze is focused on an argument in the back mirror. And in his frustration and refusal to comprehend that Iris might not want to be saved, it seems there is little time between his next purge."
"willwoodmill","9","0","2","13 March 2016"," Martin Scorsese's New Hollywood masterpiece about loneliness and redemption
","In the early 70s Martin Scorsese was quickly gaining popularity, he had become a part of the New Hollywood movement. Films like Who's That Knocking At My Door? And Mean Streets perfectly encapsulate what the movement was all about. Yes Scorsese was on the rise to the top. And he finally reached the top with his 1976 film Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver tells the story of the depressed insomniac Vietnam war vet Travis Bickle, played by arguably the greatest actor of all time Robert De Niro, who gets a job as a graveyard shift taxi driver. Travis spends his off hours in porn theaters and stalking a woman called Betsy, played by Cybill Shepard, who works for senator/presidential candidate Charles Palantine. Eventually Bickle convinces Betsy to go on a date with him, which ends horribly after he takes her to a porno. After Betsy's rejection, Bickle spirals down a hole of hatred contempt and isolation, he rambles on madly about wanting to clean the filth of the streets. But Bickle finds new purpose after he meats the underage prostitute Iris, (played by Jodie Foster who was only 13 when the film was being made.) Bickle decides that his life's purpose is to protect Iris no matter the cost. Taxi Diver is a story of loneliness, the story of a man who was overlooked by a society that he now hates. Robert De Niro perfectly captures that essence. To prepare for the role De Niro lost 35 pounds, got a job as a New York cabbie, and even listened to the tapes of Arthur Bremer, who attempted to assassinate U.S. Presidential candidate George Wallace. Everything about De Niro's performance is flawless, from the way he stumbles over his words and his thoughts come out like a distorted broken stream of insanity. Or his dead stare of complete contempt when he sees small-time hoods walking on the street. Or the famous ad-libbed ""You talking to me?"" scene. Or that haunting smile he has on his face in the climax of the film. De Niro definitely gave us a performance for the history books.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all-time, and he shines through in Taxi Driver. Scorsese is able to capture the audience and force them into the world of the crazed Travis Bickle, by keeping the film in a constant quick descent into his madness. In order to achieve this flow Scorsese will often have the camera move even if just slightly, especially in the first half of the film before we our fully immersed in his dark film. This flow of camera movement and sharp editing allows him to better control his audience. Scorsese also traps us in the world of Travis Bickle by paying close attention to background detail, throughout the film there we are constantly surrounded by propaganda for Palantine, and yet his opponent is never even mentioned, or when Travis mentions to Betsy that he's going to get a sign that says, ""one of these days I'm gonna get organiz- ized"" and then latter in the film when he is organized that sign is hanging in his crappy apartment. Or how Scorsese focuses on all of the ""scum"" that Travis talks about. (Whores fighting in the streets, pimps sitting in Restaurants.) Oh and also pay close attention to how pills are used throughout the film. All of this attention to detail really makes the audience feel like their stuck in the terrible world of Bickle.<br/><br/>Paul Schrader, who worked with Scorsese several times, wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver. And the Screenplay is a work of pure genius. Well most of it is, there is one flaw with the screenplay that is actually the only flaw I have with the entire film. In a later scene in the film, Iris is talking to her pimp, (played by Martin Scorsese regular Harvey Keitel.) who she calls sport. The scene itself is great, both actors are fantastic and it gives context to Iris's situation. But the problem with the scene is that it cuts away from Travis Bickle. It's the only scene in the whole film to do that and it really breaks the films flow, because it means we have to exit the mind of Bickle. The scene just temporally derails the film, in would be much better without it. But going back to Jodie Foster, she is just amazing in the film. It's really hard to believe she was only 13 when they made it. She was nominated for best supporting actress but she really should have won. Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest film composers of all time, scored Taxi Driver (the final film he scored.) and needless to say, it's flawless. The way it moves from a quick loud jazz drum kit, to a smooth saxophone is just perfect. The soundtrack fully captures the feel of the gritty underbelly of New York. <br/><br/>Taxi Driver was only nominated for four Oscars when it was first released and won none, but it did win the Palme d'Or. As time went on it slowly began to be considered one of the greatest films of all time, it made it onto Roger Ebert's Great Movie's, placed 31st on Sight and Sounds critic poll, and 5th on their directors poll. It was also added to the United States National Film Registry in 1994. Taxi Driver legacy has not been all good. In 1981 John Hinckley shaved his hair into a Mohawk, and tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan in order to impress Jodi Foster. But even with that unfortunate incident Taxi Driver became a perfect example of American filmmaking, showing how in-genius and dark it could be.<br/><br/>9.9/10"

He wants to fix the wrongs he sees in the cesspool that has become NY, He wants to save Foster the 12 year old prostitute. Bickle is an anti-hero, because his methods are not solely for the saving of the girl. He kills the low lives of society and is glorified for it by media. He actively plans out and trains his body for these killings, to satisfy the rage he has toward the miscreants of society. The editing is very good and Scorsese does a wonderful job directing, mainly because of the ambiguous ending of the film.

","In its exploration of the surreal visually, alongside simpler, realist daytime shots of New York City, shows how that line can blur because of something like insomnia.

Colorful, but not too bright, and often even fluorescent, keeps the movie looking more like the sleazy New York that Travis sees, rather than a professional set.<br/><br/>Travis is caught somewhere between the uber-professional and ""normal"" world of Betsy(Cybill Shepherd)(shown primarily in daytime shots of ""normal"" buildings and people, and the seedy underbelly occupied by Iris(Jodie Foster)(shown in the nighttime, blurred by colorful lights, deep shadows, and violence). His ties to both are through wanting, he wants to occupy Betsy's world, and he wants to save Iris, so the combination of these two worlds is strange visually. They're tied together by Travis's internal narration.<br/><br/>The filmmaking gets less typical as the movie goes on. As Travis becomes more aggressive, there are scenes like the famous testing of lines in case of confrontation (""You talking' to me?""), clearly chopped together. They really come to a head after a particularly violent point in the movie, seemingly frozen in time.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver creatively and powerfully blurs the night and day to tell the story of an insomniac living within that blurry line. It's good-looking, witty, and aggressive (though it exists somewhere between awake and sleep)."

Di Niro is so creepy yet you enjoy is vigilantism of going around the city ""protecting"" it.

I've seen Bickle's name on some ""Top 10 Film Heroes"" and ""Top 10 Movie Villains List"". Whatever he is, he is just the perfect every day man. Quoting the Film he is ""God's Lonely Man"". Whatever he does it clearly only goes wrong, to the extreme where I would dare to call the movie a tragedy.<br/><br/>Now **SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>I have a theory about the ending.

The self-reflection is the one of theme and it is illustrated in the famous mirror-scene that Travis speaks to mirror. But Travis is also a voyeuristic substitute of us as audience. We observe what goes on around him. We can leads how he becomes a murderer. We can feel both positions about surveillance. Therefore, they shocked and feel anxiety. Then, give audiences a strong impression."

","Simply put I believe 'Taxi driver' to be the best film ever made. I do not understand how we live in a world where 'Django unchained' can be rated higher on IMDb than this classic 70's film. This film has a phenomenal story and score and it's all backed up perfectly by the best director of all time, Martin Scorsese, the best actress of all time, Jodie Foster, and the best actor of all time in the brilliant Robert De Niro. Put them together and you have cinematic perfection. The tension builds from the very start as we realize that Travis Bickle is not an ordinary character and we see him slowly come to the realisation that the world is full of despicable people and needs cleaning up and it all leads to an inevitable climax that is perfectly crafted and soo violently realized. This film is absolute perfection and needs to be recognised more greatly in my opinion."

","No wonder why this movie is such a classic. The performances of De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster are all stunning. But definitely most of the merit goes to Scorsese. The way the movie is shot, its cinematography, its colours, its music, its aura, they all drag the viewer deep into the Travis' world, to the point you fully understand his disturbing actions. The way the movie slowly builds up to the climax is perfect. The plot line is never too slow as to bore the audience, yet the way the anti-hero's psyche evolves at a glaciar pace, from the point he gets the job as a taxi driver to the final climax, is truly remarkable. And it's disturbing how current the theme is, with so many mass shooting happening in the US. It really points to a side of modern civilization we need to look at much more, how so many people are completely alone with their minds in the huge metropolis, not really understanding why their world is so messed up."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","2","15 August 2015"," Pretty interesting, but doesn't age as well as some classics.
","This is the story of a naturally bad man doing a good thing, though maybe not in the best way. Perhaps saying that Travis is a bad man is taking it a bit far, but regardless he has a tendency to take violent actions. It might not be plausible that Travis is regarded as a hero rather than a criminal for shooting up Sport and his men, but he deserved some sort of recognition for choosing the right place to put his actions. Then again, he also planned to kill Palantine, so maybe it was mere coincidence that he chose to take down a socially destructive institution rather than say a school or a hospital.<br/><br/>The plot is motivated almost solely by the progression of Travis' thoughts and how he copes with his mental issues. His first solution is taking a night shift as a taxi driver. Through that he meets one of Palantine's campaign workers, Betsy, and tries to befriend her. He blows it and goes into depression for a little while. Then he gets the idea to vent his feelings through violence when one of his passengers tells Travis of his intention to kill his wife and the black man with her. Travis slowly begins to realize how much crime and other vulgar behavior there is on the streets of New York. He gets to meet a byproduct of this crime in the twelve year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), and her plight motivates him to bring down the institution that she works for.<br/><br/>Travis, our antihero protagonist, is most himself when he's alone, as I'm sure most people are. When he's around people, he comes off as overly sincere, a little like when Benedict Cumberpatch's Sherlock tries to be more human. He doesn't seem to understand certain things when it comes to interacting with people like the scene where he talks to Palantine and when he takes Betsy to the porn theater. It's not severe, but there's something that he's missing socially. You could argue that Betsy is portrayed as faultless and unrealistic, but she has a definite personality and doesn't tolerate nonsense from the guys she encounters. Iris is very well written in that she has clearly seen more than a pre- adolescent should, but is still growing up and feels like a kid. The other minor characters consist of Iris' boss Sport, Palantine, Travis' fellow taxi driver Wizard, and the guy with the afro and glasses who works with Betsy.<br/><br/>The acting and script was good, maybe great for the time. It's shot pretty well, but there aren't any wowing camera tricks. I wasn't hugely impressed by the ""you talking to me?"" monologue, probably because they show most of it in the trailer. The action sequence at the end isn't terribly realistic, but you probably won't notice or care much unless you're really nit-picking.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed in the movie as a whole, probably because I expected there to be a twist ending. There's a little bit of surprise at the end since we Travis never states outright that he plans to use his newly acquired guns and skills as a means to save Iris and/or kill Palantine. I didn't even know that he was planning to assassinate Palantine while I was watching it, but it makes sense now. To a modern audience, it might not have a huge effect, but it's still a classic and worth a try for anyone who doesn't mind stepping out of the feel-good genre. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","The story of Travis Bickle is one of loneliness, anger, and disillusionment with the dirt and grime of society. Bickle falls for a political campaign worker, and then becomes enthralled in the life of a teenage prostitute. The only reason society sees Bickle as a hero is because of the victims of his anger, but as the movie's ambiguous ending shows...he won't be a hero next time.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro skillfully displays Bickle's mental state in the classic ""You talking' to me?"" scene (which was an improvisation). Jodie Foster does a great job portraying the teenage prostitute, bringing a depth to the character that few child, preteen, or teen actors can bring to the table. Scorsese's directing ties everything together, making for a masterfully crafted film. This is (currently) my all-time favorite movie, and I don't see anything topping it any time soon."

","Taxi Driver is a true classic and one of the best films ever made. Robert DeNiro gives one of his most compelling performances as disaffected Vietnam war vet and mentally unstable loner. The film is mostly a character study of Travis Bickle, under the backdrop of NYC in the 1970's. Which was a truly dangerous, but interesting place. In this environment, our main man Travis boiling over in a violent rage is inevitable. Writer Paul Shrader and director Martin Scorsese crafted a very important, unique and real well crafted film that is a classic and influence many filmmakers to come. While there are many movies that have been influenced by Taxi Driver, very few of them are in the same class. Taxi Driver is Scorsese/Shrader's post Vietnam urban American masterpiece that is powerful, gritty and uncompromising. Robert DeNiro is pretty much always great, but this is one of his finest performances and I can't think of anyone who could play this character as well as he did here. I have a lot of admiration and respect for 70's cinema, an era where filmmakers had much more artistic control and had the balls to make movies like this."

His isolation grows from awkwardly heartbreaking to deeply unnerving to straight-out mystifying when underage Jodie Foster becomes involved. Not to mention the assassination attempt.

","Taxi driver, directed by Martin Scorsese tells the story of a Vietnam vet. With a war as controversial as that one to begin with this movie was bound to be a hit. The incorporation of PTSD within the vet's violent urges is a beautiful addition to a movie such as this one. Robert Di Niro was an excellent choice in the decision of the actors. The only real complaint about this movie is the plot is not as exciting as it could have been. It's very A-B-C. One thing leads to another which leads to the climax and the ending. The dark lighting in many scenes really serves the purpose of what was happening within the main character. These types of filming styles were very big during this time and allowed for many people to connect to a story line in a different way than the obvious."

","""Taxi Driver"" is not considered one of the greatest movies ever made for no reason. There are so many things that bear significance within the movie for the time, and even for now. The film takes place right after the Vietnam War, when the effects of the war was still prevalent among the community. Violence is a fixated them within the film, however it isn't unwarranted. The violence that Travis engages in is oddly judicial, acting as a vigilante he contends with the gripes of a corrupted society. The film sends a subliminal message, that violence and corruption have become an issue within our country. During the time this was no shocking revelation, but an apparent one. Citizens had lost trust for the government after being lied to countless times about information regarding the countries involvement in Vietnam, so it was up to the individual to do what was right essentially. There is one interesting scene in particular, at the end where a woman hails Travis as a hero and he politely denies and exempts her payment. Showing the importance of communication between a society and its members."

","This was Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece and this was his first film which made him a famous director. It's about an insomniac taxi driver who works the late night shift because he can't sleep at night. It's a great character study showing him trying to fit back into everyday life. The cinematography is excellent and it shows the night life through the rear window of his taxi cab mirrors. The gradual transformation from man to beast in this movie is chilling. At first, he tries to kill a politician but then he turns his intention to a pimp who exploits teenage prostitutes. It's funny when he threatens himself in the mirror by saying ""You talking to me?"" but when he comes out with sunglasses and a mohawk hairdo, it's clear that he's going to do something nasty. Robert De Niro's performance is fantastic. It's clearly De Niro's best performance to date. His acting is very intense and it helped him make an impression. The movie is enhanced by an excellent jazz soundtrack by composer Bernard Herrman which draws people into the movie. ""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it first came out both by critics and moviegoers. It has been labeled as one of the best American films many times. This is a must see for all film lovers and it will likely age real well."

","SLIGHT ""SPOILERS"" THAT WON'T ACTUALLY SPOIL ANYTHING Excellent psychological film that explores the mind of an unstable Vietnam vet who drives a taxi during the night and perceives the streets around him through the prism of his warped reality. Many things about this masterpiece and the exquisite acting of Robert De Niro have already been said, so I will try to focus on some things that were of particular interest to me.<br/><br/>The main protagonist desperately wants to talk with people, especially women, asking each one of them to tell him their names. Thus, he tries to overcome huge alienation that he feels even when he communicates with others; he wants to truly approach to a person and get to know him/her. However, that is not likely to happen in fake and false human relationships. At one point, he thinks that there are some connection between him and the woman he sees as isolated from ubiquitous scum, but soon he changes his attitude towards her. ""She is the same like everybody else"", he says ""cold and distant. Many people are like that, women especially. They are like union."" Travis Biskle is obsessed with cleaning the lowlife, scum and dirt that cover the city streets. He says he doesn't like hippie communes as well, since they are not particularly clean. The connection with his Vietnam past is clear â€“ the main goal in war is to ""clean the scum""."
"rj522","9","0","2","30 March 2015"," A Powerful, Psychological, Must-see Classic.
","I find it important to go back and watch movies that came out before the present day. It's very interesting to compare parts of the movie to the events during that film's time period. Additionally, some of the best movies came out well before the birth of the modern generation. This is a masterpiece by director Martin Scorsese. I believe that Taxi Driver is one of those movies that you have to see. It features one of the best actors of all-time in his prime; Robert De Niro makes a stunning performance as the character ""Travis Bickle"". You can look deep into his role from a psychological perspective. Travis Bickle is a Vietnam-War veteran who seems to suffer from serious depression and insomnia. To cope with this, Bickle becomes a taxi driver who drives night and day. He doesn't carry much of a social life and even separates himself from his passengers. When he's not picking up fares, he is watching XXX movies. When Bickle falls for Cybill Shepherd's character ""Betsy"" he watches her from outside until deciding to go into the poll office and ask her out. He later takes her out on a date in which they go to a XXX movie. Betsy is disturbed and never talks to him again. This is a perfect example of how the war negatively affected him and has made him incapable of proper social interaction. Another thing is how deeply affected he is by seeing Jodie Foster's character ""Iris"" be thrown around like a piece of property. He isn't just disgusted by it, he is sickened with her pimp ""Sport"" and holds a grudge against him. Later in the movie Bickle leaves Iris money before he attempts to assassinate the Senator. After the assassination plan fails, Bickle storms in the brothel on a vendetta and eventually kills Sport, among other gangster characters. All of these events occur because Bickle has a rather special hatred for people he doesn't agree with. Beside the psychological terms, it is just overall an interesting movie with Robert De Niro at his best. Some parts of the movie are iconic as well; like when Bickle is standing in the mirror at his apartment and coins the phrase ""You talking' to me?"". That scene in itself is excellent because Martin Scorsese told De Niro to improvise and that was the result."

","A lot of people present this movie as something that it is not. This movie is not a thriller, and even though it is listed correctly as a drama by most websites, the audience remembers the ending to the film much too well sometimes. This is a film about Travis Bickle's loneliness.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro has never been better than he is in this movie. I think that we all have been lonely at least for a small portion of our lives, and Robert De Niro presents just what they may feel like excellently. His lack of understanding of where to (and where not to) take a date just shows how unaware he really is of how most people think and react to things like that.<br/><br/>Bickle presents a character that at times makes you want to reach out and tell him that everything is okay, but other times you just want to run from him. I have just seen this movie for the first time, so I might need to see it a few more time before I truly appreciate it thoroughly. With that being said, I don't think that this film is a ten out of ten, nor do I think it is Scorsese's best.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a very good drama with excellent performances. I think this film could have gained a lot from cutting off about a half hour, but other than that, a very good film. 8/10"

","Certain films are iconic in themselves or for certain lines, Taxi Driver falls into both categories. I have often heard it talked about and I could not even begin to count how many times I have heard people say the lines, ""You talking to me, are you, talking to me, you must be talking to me cause I don't see anybody else here."". So saying that, I finally got around to seeing it and I think it is a really good movie, probably not as great as everybody thinks it is, but overall I liked it a lot. De Niro does an excellent job as Travis Bickle, you really get the feeling of isolation while being in the middle of everyone, and the score and city itself really helps with that. If I was judging this movie on acting alone I would give it 5 stars, but due to the amount of swearing, the fact that Bickles idea of a nice date is to go to a pornographic movie and the child prostitution kinda makes it lose some stars, but I do understand some of that is necessary for the story. The cast for Taxi Driver was really good too, and I don't think I have ever seen Harvey Keitel look that young before. So overall Taxi Driver was pretty darn amazing, although I doubt Bickle would have survived with that many wounds, and if he did, I am pretty sure he would have been thrown in to jail for what he did, but what do you want, its a movie. 4.5 Beards Out Of 5"

","The directorial genius that is Martin Scorsese and the cinematic magic he has created with the gifted Robert De Niro was never seen to greater advantage than in the 1976 classic Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>This is a chilling and bold character study that takes a look at the effects of loneliness, isolation, alienation, and PTSD and the effects that politics and violence can have on an already mentally shredded psyche. <br/><br/>De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a slightly disturbed insomniac who gets himself a job driving a taxi because he cannot sleep and he basically has no life. We then watch as Travis' midnight to six sojourns throughout the violent underbelly of Manhattan and how his already questionable mentally instability cause him to become obsessed with murdering a political candidate and an equally strong obsession with a 12 year old prostitute who he decides it his responsibility to rescue from this life that he has decided for her she no longer wants to live. He also becomes obsessed with an icy blonde who works for the political candidate he wants to assassinate.<br/><br/>Scorsese brilliantly recreates the seedy and often bone-chilling atmosphere of Manhattan after midnight, making Bickle's comfort in the atmosphere all the more unsettling, not to mention the atmosphere created by the few scenes that take place in Travis' apartment, a sparse place of convenience that contains a little more than a bed and some weights and the sparse equipment that Travis feels necessary to complete his ""mission."" Sometimes watching Bickle at home is even more unsettling than when he is in the taxi, making the character equal parts creepy, fascinating and pathetic. It's sad to watch how socially inept Travis is when he gets the blonde (Cybill Shepherd) to agree to go see a movie with him for their first date and he actually takes her to a porno film, not having any idea how inappropriate this is for a date movie and his confused reaction to her walking out is almost as heartbreaking as it is pathetic.<br/><br/>De Niro gives a powerhouse performance as Bickle, which galvanizes the screen and mention should also be made of Jodie Foster's Oscar nominated performance as Iris the hooker and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, who are centrally involved in the film's shockingly violent denouement. De Niro received a Best Actor nomination as did the film for Best Picture. Fans of Scorsese and De Niro probably consider this film their masterwork and deservedly so."
"The Grand Master","10","0","3","17 February 2015"," An all time masterpiece that will remain immortalised as a cinematic classic.
","It's hard to believe that Taxi Driver is almost 40 years old. Released in 1976, Taxi Driver has earned a well deserved spot in cinematic history as an all time classic masterpiece. In the early stages of many collaborations as an actor and director, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese bring to life an urban tale of alienation and one lonely man's struggle to get a grip of his sanity in a rapidly decaying New York City. Robert De Niro is also strongly supported by an all star cast, including Jodie Foster, Harvey Kietel, Albert Brooks, and Peter Boyle.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a former U.S. Marine who gets a job as a taxi driver in New York City. He is also plagued with insomnia, loneliness, and the inability to connect with others on an emotional level. Throughout his night shifts he witnesses society at its worst, and often longs for the real rain to wash the scum off the streets. When he is not working, Travis spends time in a variety of pornographic theaters and keeps to himself in his small apartment. Travis often keeps his personal thoughts written down in his diary. He is still quite guarded around fellow drivers including Wizard (Peter Boyle). Travis' life takes a successful turn when he becomes infatuated with Presidential campaign worker Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) and he successfully asks her out on a date. The date starts off on the right foot but ends badly when Betsy is disgusted with Travis taking her to a pornographic theater and thus Betsy breaks it off with Travis. Travis tries to make it up to Betsy but she constantly rebuffs him. The relationship ends for good when Travis berates Betsy at her work and Tom (Albert Brooks) kicks Travis out. After a chance meeting with Presidential candidate Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Brooks), Travis turns his unhealthy obsessions towards Charles Palantine. Travis also befriends a teenage prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster) who wants to leave but is unable to do so as she is under the thumb of her pimp and lover Matthew ""Sport"" (Harvey Kietel). Travis prepares for a confrontation by physically transforming himself and obtaining several handguns so he can do what needs to be done. The only question here is, is he going to be a hero or the villain? Robert De Niro has enjoyed a stellar career and his filmography over the past 40 years has been very impressive. Taxi Driver is often mentioned as one of his best movies, and rightfully so. No other actor could capably portray the troubled Travis Bickle, and Robert De Niro has done an admirable job. Robert De Niro earned an Academy Award nomination for his role as Travis Bickle, but unfortunately lost to Peter Finch who posthumously won for his role in Network (1976). Jodie Foster went on to become a successful actress as well as a two time Academy Award Winner for her roles in The Accused (1988) and The Silence of The Lambs (1991). Her role as the teenage prostitute Iris made critics and audiences sit up and take notice. Harvey Kietel has also enjoyed a great career and Taxi Driver sits up near the top of the list along with such movies as Reservoir Dogs (1992), Bad Lieutenant (1992), The Piano (1993), and Pulp Fiction (1994). The late Peter Boyle is well known to TV audiences for his role in Everybody Loves Raymond, but here he does a great job as fellow cab driver Wizard.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's direction is pure brilliance and it can be said that Taxi Driver proved to become a pivotal moment in his career. Martin Scorsese has gone on to direct further excellent movies in his career, but Taxi Driver highlights Scorsese at his best. Paul Schrader's screenplay is extremely intelligent and also has dark moments of humour. Bernard Herrmann's hauntingly sombre jazz score (which was also his last before his untimely death) is outstanding. <br/><br/>Though Taxi Driver is a very intense and violent movie, it is no stranger to controversy. Taxi Driver attracted negative publicity in 1981 when it was revealed John Hinkley Jr, who attempted to assassinate Ronald Regan, was deeply obsessed with the movie. Hinkley Jr also became infatuated with actress Jodie Foster, and carried out his assassination attempt in order to win her affection. Hinkley Jr was later found not guilty by reason of insanity but later confined to a psychiatric hospital.<br/><br/>Many people commonly perceive Taxi Driver as an action movie. When I think of action movies, movies such as the Lethal Weapon series, the Die Hard series, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Rambo, and Jason Bourne instantly come to mind. Taxi Driver is a gritty drama which doesn't come close to an action movie. Travis Bickle is certainly not an heroic character that audiences find themselves cheering on. Travis Bickle is an emotionally troubled, paranoid, and mentally unstable person, and the movie portrays him as an anti hero instead of the villain.<br/><br/>Nobody can dispute the classic scene where Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle is acting out an imagined confrontation in front of a mirror which gives him a chance to draw his handgun. The line ""You talking' to me?"" has firmly embedded itself as one of the greatest lines in cinematic history. It's also amazing that this line was not in Paul Schrader's script, but in fact improvised by Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>""You talking' to me? You talking' to me? You talking' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking' to? You talking' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who the f*** do you think you're talking to? Oh yeah? Okay."" <br/><br/>Robert De Niro has never been better in his iconic role, Jodie Foster's career later skyrocketed, and Martin Scorsese's first masterpiece will always remain immortalised. Taxi Driver is a cinematic classic that will stay with you forever.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10."

Travis was definitely out of his mind, living in a place like that would make one rethink about their sanity. Robert De Niro's character goes from annoyed and calm to chaotic and violent all in a matter of days/weeks. The taxi ride scenes were pretty cool when it comes to the use of the camera. I loved how the mirrors on the vehicle were used to show us scenery but also the people who got into the taxi. It made for a wild ride. I some ways it felt as if we (the audience) was in the back/passenger seat. The lighting was great too, though it was natural light it worked.

I think Robert De Nero is perfect for this part; a veteran who has taken an overnight shifts as a taxi driver and is now obsessed with crime and cleaning up the city. I think it was interesting to see, even though it was terrible to watch, the progression of a veteran go from attempting to be a normal man post the war, to a crazy man at the end of the film. The end of the movie was great when he goes on the killing rampage in attempt to save the young girl. The cops come in and there he is sitting on the couch, after getting shot in the neck and he puts his bloody hand up to his head, in the shape of a gun, and pretends to shoot himself over and over again.

","When I finished watching Taxi Driver, I felt uncomfortable and I didn't understand this film. Firstly, I'm going to talk about the relationship between background and this film. This film was created in 1976 and at that time, there were the Vietnam War and the assassination. The main character, Travis Bickle, was a marine and he suffers from insomnia which is related to the seriousness of the war. Furthermore, his hair style is also the influence of the war. In 1972, Arthur Herman Bremer tried to assassinate George. C. Wallace and becomes the first and only one person who becomes a free man again. Mr. Bremer said at the time of his trial that his motive was to become a celebrity, and many observers have noted the pernicious, if unintended, effect that intense media attention has had, glamorizing assassins and inspiring copycats. Finally, I have some comments and questions. First, what did Martin Scorsese want to tell us? The meaning of this film is unclear and the ending story is really terrifying and annoying so I don't like it but I think he tells us that there are a lot of evils which is allowed in our society. On the other hand, it has some good points. I like camera works of Travis's sight which seems to a real world and a fantasy. The long mirror scene is also funny. In addition, I like the sticker on his cloth at the end. It is nice to watch this film and compare with history but sometimes you have to see brutal scenes."

It's true that he killed bad men, but he should be accused of his murder. Furthermore, he didn't know their personality when he killed the people. In spite of everything which he committed, he does work as if he does nothing. I think this situation will drive ordinary people crazy, or they won't be able to do their job just like before. As I said in the first paragraph, I don't like watching violent films, but I can learn several things, especially camera works, through watching this film."
"blazesnakes9","10","0","1","21 August 2014"," Classic 1970's masterpiece from Martin Scorsese
","Taxi Driver is a film that really shows us what American Cinema was all about. At a time where movies were made for entertainment, some challenged movie-goers with some of the most controversial subject matter ever to be put on film. Many of today well known directors were starting out big with their first feature length movie. But, Martin Scorsese was one of those directors who really captured what the 1970's were all about. He shows us all of it in this film.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro), is an loner who spends most of his time prowling the streets of New York City at night. An Vietnam veteran, he narrates the story with a flat, eerie voice that somehow gives the movie an very dark tone to it. ""All of the animals come out at night"", he says. ""Someday a real rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets."" Suffering from insomnia, he also spends some of his time watching porno movies and living in an apartment building, where welfare seems to cover everything. One day, he spies on a woman, (Cybill Shepard), who is working at a campaign headquarters. At first, Bickle develops an crush on her and even asks her out on a date. But, she rejects him because of his habit of seeing dirty movies. Isolating himself from society, Bickle starts to tense up and decides that the only way to strike back is with violence. In one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, Bickle practices his intimidation by talking to a wall and says, ""Are you talking to me? Talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here."" By the end of the movie, Bickle's violent behavior and actions reaches a bloody climax when he gets his chance. <br/><br/>The movie is more of a character study between different personalities. Travis and the woman he loves come from different backgrounds. Screenwriter Paul Schrader illustrates these characters by experimenting with each others likes and feelings. But toward a more thought-provoking point, the movie showcases an long-lasting argument between an dream and a reality. The woman that Travis loves is shown to be an angelic figure, one who's blessed. But, when mental deterioration crosses with her presence, nothing is ever forgiving. From there on, Bickle puts himself through intense training to avenge society. His thirst of violence intensifies when he goes to a gun dealer and buys several guns off of him. <br/><br/>The cast of the movie is outstanding. Not only De Niro steals the show, but the movie has a strong supporting cast including Jodie Foster, as a teenage hooker who befriends Travis, Albert Brooks, as the man who's interested in Cybill Shepard, but dislikes Travis and also Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle stars in this masterpiece as well.<br/><br/>Bernard Herrmann creates a strong and resounding score that has a jazzy sense to it. The score is perhaps the most important piece in the movie because Herrmann is master of scoring movies that makes the film more atmospheric with its grimy look of New York City. The sound of the score illustrates the mind of Travis Bickle. When we first see him, his eyes curiously looks around while exhaust fumes fill the screen. Even the red tint on the neon lit signs makes the setting of the movie looks like a hell. Several times through the entire movie, the color red symbolizes a world where hope is not present, but Travis' inner demons are hovering all over him. Like his score in Vertigo, Herrmann makes an hypnotizing sense of insomnia, alienation and isolation.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro has never given an better performance of his career. His performance in Taxi Driver is an template of what movie acting is all about. When he grins for the first time in the movie, we get the notion that his appearance is rather frightening, but very mysterious. The way he grins by giving that eerie smile makes Travis Bickle believable. We know from the beginning of the movie that he's not a hero even though the people around him praised him for what he did to Iris. As for Jodie Foster, she doesn't glamorizes her role as Iris. She is trying to get out of the city, but she needs Travis to help her. That on-screen performance is something to look for. Her performance is an essential part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese does a outstanding job directing this movie. He really knows New York City. He knows how to hook the viewer and take them on a journey through the rough streets of every neighborhood in the city. His way of making characters into sinners is something mesmerizing. The shots of the rain wetting the streets. The way the windshield wipers wipes off the rain on Travis' cab when he travels through the night. The symbolism of what Scorsese shows you is something to study on. You have to pay attention to every speck of detail he gives you. Even when the characters stop to chat for a while, pay attention to how they talk to one another. That's what makes it such a great film. It's movies like Taxi Driver that captures a time not long forgotten, but long gone. Both the cinema world and to the world of the 1970's. ★★★★ 4 stars."
"rbrooksie12","10","0","1","10 August 2014"," Brooks--Taxi Driver Review
","Taxi Driver was the film that made actor Robert De Niro, director Martin Scorsese, and screenwriter Paul Schrader household names. This film is a trip into one mans hell. The movie stars Robert De Niro as lonely ex-marine Travis Bickle. The movie takes place in New York, and the movie seems to act like a character. Right as the film opens as we see a cab drive through clouds and hear Bernard Hermann's wonderful score we know this movie will be a dark film.<br/><br/>About twenty minutes into the movie, Travis meets Betsy (who is played by Cybill Sheperd). Travis is immediately attracted to Betsy and makes a great effort to be his girlfriend. Betsy plays a very key role in this movie because she is the one woman in Travis' life who he is close to, and even though she obviously doesn't want to be close to him, makes a heavy effort for her to be close to him.<br/><br/>About forty-five minutes into the movie we meet Iris (who is played wonderfully by 12 year old Jodie Foster). When we meet Iris it is kind of a surprise, her walking in front of Travis' cab forcing Travis to slam on the breaks and right as he does this, Bernard Hermann's great score comes in. It is a jumpy moment and a strange way to introduce her as a character, yet this brief encounter makes Travis learn more about her.<br/><br/>The ending is wonderfully done by filmmaker Martin Scorsese and Special Makeup Artist Dick Smith. It is a wonderful yet dark movie that will disturb some. De Niro gives a great performance in his second out of eight team-ups with Scorsese. A landmark in cinema and an unforgettable movie experience will make you want to watch this again. An important film. 10/10."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","3 August 2014"," Martin Scorsese achieves cinematic greatness by giving us the classic ""Taxi Driver' with a chilling performance by Robert De Niro.
","People living in a low-social class with constant disrespect being enforced on them tend to want to branch out and finally achieve greatness. In order to do so, what does oneself do? Martin Scorsese directs an unsettling lifestyle in a dark and mysterious way artistically. . Robert De Niro gives one of his most cutting edge performances as Travis, a mentally disturbed Taxi Driver in New York who after serving his time in Vietnam is unhappy with his lonely and worthless life. Travis is treated poorly by the people he drives around, makes no money, lives alone, watches pornographic films and is going nowhere. One day he meets a beautiful volunteer for a senator of New York running for President. As Travis fails at their relationship, he becomes sick by the crime and prostitution occurring on the streets, so begins physical training and arms himself from the dangers. Travis eventually meets a young prostitute named iris (Jodie Foster) and tries to take out an evil pimp played by Harvey Keitel who treats Iris poorly. Travis is such an interesting character who shows the life of misery perfectly. Travis' transformation from a low-life to a man on a mission constantly always on guard is chilling and gut-wrenching. Scorsese shows the treatment of post Vietnam marines and awakens the world as to how hard it was to cope with ordinary society and the lifestyle of being a nobody like no one you have ever seen. Writer Peter Schrader gives a blistering story that starts off slow and makes us want to feel sad for Travis, but then leads us into a degrading world filled with crime and gets under your skin like a razor blade. Robert De Niro transforms his character beautifully, giving chilling sequences when he's the only character on screen, or when he's dealing with some of the sickest criminals imaginable. Perfect acting by De Niro portraying a soulless man with a troubled past and a determined psycho with a heart. He's a diverse actor playing a diverse character. Scorsese portrays the streets of New York in a tale of politics, crime and mental health disorders and works with everyone greatly to make a creative film. ""Taxi Driver"" has a very complex ending that allows you to decide what it meant. That fits in with the mysterious feel and style of the film. We get to see a corrupt society through one man and it is absolutely fascinating to see it through a disturbed and mentally ill person. ""Taxi Driver"" is a film that filmmakers look at for inspiration and should be regarded as one of the most unique and gripping works of art you'll ever encounter."
"thedudeabides-2","10","0","1","31 July 2014"," Relentlessly bleak and intense, Taxi Driver is one of the most important movies ever made.
","'You talking' to me?' With these four words, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorcese entered the Hollywood hall of fame, and with good reason. For, even if you have not yet seen Taxi Driver, you will most certainly have heard of it and possibly even watched its most famous scene. If you fall into this category, it is time to sit down and appreciate Martin Scorcese's 1976 masterpiece.<br/><br/>The plot centres on Travis Bickle, a 20 something loner who works the nighttime taxi shift on the streets of New York. We follow Travis as he becomes increasingly disillusioned at the sleaziness and decadence which he is subjected to on a nightly basis. Robert De Niro gives one of his finest performances as Bickle - a morally ambiguous Vietnam war veteran who may, or may not, be losing his mind. With the movie focused almost solely on Travis, there is a lot of pressure on De Niro's performance, and he delivers in spades. It is a cinematic tour de force and must surely rank as one of the best performances in modern movies. In lesser hands, Travis may have come off as completely crazy, but De Niro's subtle performance makes the viewer question his motives, and his sanity, at every turn.<br/><br/>Scorcese chooses to shoot New York City as a sleazy playground filled with criminals, prostitutes and other undesirables. There are a number of dreamlike shots which echo Travis' fragile state of mind and Bernard Hermann's sinister score contributes to an underlying sense of danger which is prevalent throughout the movie. This is where the beauty of Taxi Driver lies; it is not a simple tale of good vs. evil, but rather an exploration of one man's loneliness and how it can lead to some truly devastating consequences.<br/><br/>An absolute masterpiece of modern cinema and arguably Scorcese's best film. Taxi Driver is one of the most engrossing, disturbing and endlessly watchable movies ever made. With De Niro and Scorcese on top form, you will be thinking and talking about this movie for many years to come."

","This one is a good movie in terms of a lot of things. The film depicts a character who is very lonely. I like the way that Robert De Niro did Travis Bickle, the character who is very lonely. It kind of resembles a little bit of my lifetime. I used to be lonely when it comes to friends who are very important. Anyways, another thing about this is that the music. I like the way the songs were put in the film and how they were from different artists. What Martin Scorsese did was unbelievable in a good way. He not only directed this film, but he also participated in the acting. We may not see him exactly in the film, but his silhouette is very good. The only bad thing about this is that there was a little too much crime in this film for me. I'm not used to crime, unless I see it in superhero movies. Overall, this is another film that people have to see again."

","""You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.""<br/><br/>If you look up the word 'masterpiece' in the dictionary, Taxi Driver is its definition. Not only does it appeal subjectively to audiences but it is a complete film in all the technical aspects as well. It has a stunning cinematography capturing the dark and dirty streets of New York City, a gorgeous and eerie score that accompanies the action perfectly, some amazing camera angles and shots, perfect editing, and some of the greatest ever performances you will see in a film. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a visually stunning film that happens to be one of the greatest character studies of all time. There have been hundreds of films focusing on characters suffering from some sort of traumatic experience from war, but none have captured that complex mental breakdown as well as De Niro's Travis Bickle. Much of the credit has to be given to screenwriter Paul Schrader who suffered a similar mental breakdown and dealt with it by writing this amazing and somewhat autobiographical script, but De Niro and Scorsese took it even further by doing the best work of their careers. There isn't a single scene in this film that feels out of place and De Niro plays every note perfectly. There isn't a better character study about a Vietnam war veteran than Travis Bickle who slowly descends into psychotic behavior as he isolates himself from the rest of society and decides he has to try to do something to clean the filthy streets of New York. <br/><br/>Imagine a man who has served as a Marine in the Vietnam war only to come home and find that not only does the country he has served not appreciate him, but it has become a filthy and dirty place. That is such the case with Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) who is mentally unstable and suffering from insomnia. He decides that he might as well work as a taxi driver since he spends all night driving around anyway. We don't get any flashbacks about his experience in the war, but he is clearly disturbed by the deteriorated society he lives in. He finds it incredibly difficult to interact with anyone, but in the midst of all the filth and darkness there is one person who shines a ray of hope for him. The only redemptive quality for Travis in this city is Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who works for the presidential nomination campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). He invites Betsy out for a cup of coffee and she accepts. They share some sort of bond, but he messes up when he invites her to the cinema and takes her to a porno movie (he's so disconnected with society that he thinks it's what normal couples do). That is where their relationship ends and he completely breaks down. He becomes fascinated with guns and decides he has to clean the streets of New York. One of the first steps he takes is trying to save a twelve year old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) from her pimp and lover, Sport (Harvey Keitel), but his mind is clearly troubled and there seems to be nothing that will put it at ease.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is my favorite Scorsese film so far and I can't believe it took me so long to watch it. I can see how this film clearly resonated at a time where American society was clearly disturbed after the events of Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, but the film has transcended the test of time and it continues to be a disturbing portrait of a mentally ill man dealing with isolation. It's a wonderful film that somehow speaks to audiences differently. It has all the qualities of an art house film but somehow it has found a mainstream audience (probably thanks to Robert De Niro's stunning performance). After having seen several clips of this film I always imagined it focused on this taxi driver following around Iris, but that was actually only a small part of the film. Jodie Foster is so great in those short but memorable scenes that she is in almost every highlight of Taxi Driver. The real star however is Robert De Niro who gives such a believable and natural performance of a troubled and complex man. Taxi Driver is one of the most powerful and groundbreaking films that I've seen and so much has been written about it already. It's a unique experience and one that everyone should go through!"
"mvpharmcon","9","0","1","13 April 2014"," The knife's edge between damnation and deliverance
","This movie was a tour de force that featured De Niro in his grittiest role outside of Jake LaMotta. In a nutshell, this movie places the taxi driver Bickle on a life path so precarious and narrow that we fail, while watching the movie, to see how there could ever be an opportunity for redemption for this fallen and distressing character. Yet he transcends his descent into hell by the narrowest of margins and comes back into the light based on a single act of obsessive moral decency. The plot creates constant tension and discomfort as we see inside an unbalanced neurotic who becomes a saviour to an innocent. LOL, this review sounds like a religious essay! But I remain, to this day, captivated by the stark story-line. It suggests that if you have even a shred of goodness in you, redemption and deliverance are always possible. Stunning acting, amazing photography. Sparse dialogue. Dark and brooding the whole way through. Highly recommended. Reminds me of Deliverance in its intensity."

","The directing is first class and deservedly made path for Scorsese as a world renowned violent artist. Some techniques he used here are unusual for American cinema, like focusing on details for a few seconds. The movie is enhanced by an excellent music soundtrack by jazz composer Bernard Herrman who died before the picture was even released.<br/><br/>Two of the actors also deservedly made it to stardom. Robert de Niro plays a very unglamorous character, but his presence on screen is so intense that it's no wonder it made such an impression. As for Jodie Foster, she already appeared in films as a child, but playing a teenage prostitute was certainly not an easy challenge, and probably it was that role that really turned her into a major actress.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was a big hit when it came out, both for the public and the critics. It won the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and served as a trend setter for many later films, like for instance Quentin Tarantino's and Abel Ferrara's. But even today, the original model seems difficult to emulate, probably because achieving a masterpiece is a rare thing, by definition."

","A man who is a taxi driver hates people who are into drugs or prostitutes in the street. He is disgusted by them and takes to the extreme way to mend them. Also, he wants to show the existence of himself to everyone. This film is one of New Hollywood and an empty atmosphere prevails throughout the story. I like a series of films of New Hollywood because the story shows a unique sense of values or a view of the world and the main characters are antisocial, but they have their own idea and try to express themselves and insist on what they think even though it may be wrong. I think this film also tells us that what the right justice is as well as the importance of holding their own justice. It is a deep story. I recommend everyone, especially those who like New Hollywood to watch this film."

","""Taxi Driver"" is a prime example of a director who quite simply doesn't have the talent to meet his ambitions. ""Taxi Driver"" is bland, boring, and careless filmmaking at its finest and represents the many problems that plague all Scorsese films. <br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect is the writing, which fails to give the characters any depth or dimension. The story is chock-full of clichés, and doesn't even attempt a logical or coherent narrative. Not only does this frustrate the audience, but it leaves the movie with some awful performances from De Niro and Foster respectively. It's truly remarkable how either one of these actors received any offers after the release of this movie. <br/><br/>But that is not to say that the writing and acting is the only thing to blame. Scorsese's direction is often sporadic and doesn't quite fit the tone this kind of movie needs. Thanks to his careless directing, the film drifts into melodrama a few times too many.<br/><br/>At the hands of another director and a rewrite or two, Taxi Driver could have been an enjoyable film.

","A veteran of the Vietnam War began to work as a taxi driver in New York ... that's the story told by Martin Scorsese in his film ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), nominated for four Oscars and winner the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.<br/><br/>It is a psychological drama narrated in a linear fashion and it is about loneliness, because throughout the film we see Travis (De Niro) as a lonely man who sees society as a strange phenomenon and has trouble connecting with others.<br/><br/>It all becomes a portrait of a few days in the life of the protagonist and Scorsese takes the viewer into the inner world of Travis, which largely succeeds without using dialogue and works quite well, because everything ended up watching from Travis point of view: we entered his world slowly because of the different situations that we see.<br/><br/>We see Travis in several facets: crazy, manic, violent, angry ... Scorsese shows us his different emotions intelligently, for each triggered by a distinct situation. And although in the end we find a ""psychopath"", he ends up generating some empathy with the audience, because everyone at some point has felt strange and lonely just like Travis.<br/><br/>It is a character we know as a person, not just as a taxi driver, and gradually we realize that the mental state that he has is what takes him out of reality, but at the same time it does seem to help him achieve ""his peace"" , the peace he wanted.<br/><br/>While the film, Scorsese directs and manages it to be as extraordinary as he dreamed it. He tells the audience what he needs to know, but not what he wants to know. It has excellent performances and well constructed characters. Finally becomes a movie of ""cult"" that every movie lover should see, because of his script, how everything flows naturally and realistically, nothing feels forced and all together creates a movie that can be seen many times and still surprising the audience."

","The script of ""Taxi Driver"" is built like a diary, the diary of a very ordinary guy who gets hired as a night taxi driver back from Vietnam, because he can't sleep at night. A very ordinary guy who tries to break his isolation, but can't. The graphic and disturbing images of a man who lost his mind, control, and morals. It wasn't awful I'll give it that but I feel that labeling it as a cinematic masterpiece is a bit much. The character is interesting and we get to see the loneliness become companion to his psychosis and eventually evolve into a psychopathic violent explosion, but to what end? What was the point of the film? Overall it was entertaining. But would I recommend it? Most likely, no."

","I had heard a lot about this movie before even seeing it. It is often mentioned along with Fight Club and both of the Psychos as movies about angry adult men raging against the society and its corruption. So my expectation were high when I sat down to watch down this movie. And, truth be told, it didn't disappoint. It's a powerful movie with many memorable scenes, pieces of dialogue and a powerful main actor, the man himself, Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>The movie actually reminded me a lot about Rambo. Both movies have a war veteran, who just doesn't seem to be able to connect with the outside world anymore. They wander aimlessly through the society that doesn't care about them anymore and that tries to keep their influence to a minimum. The difference is that although Rambo is a bitter and at times brutally violent man, there's still a hint of idealism within him. He wants to be the good guy and gets depressed when the society once again disregards him. Not so much with Travis Bickle (De Niro), who's only purpose seems to be to get by. To waste away his life, half-heartedly trying to connect with it, but as he gets shunned again and again, that detachment turns to rage and we enter the Psycho/Fight Club territory.<br/><br/>And the movie makes that change work. The film is shot extremely well, with the first half of the film just drifting around, slowly following this uncomfortable, but strangely charismatic man, who always seems to either say too much or leave something vital out of his speeches. We get to see the city through his eyes and the city is very quickly found lacking. And as the city and its people keep dragging him down, he eventually accepts his apparent course and that's where the real teeth-jarring suspension starts. The final third of the film is one slow heart-stopper after another.<br/><br/>So yeah, the movie works, it really works. It's not for everyone and if you want your movies bright and optimistic, this really isn't your film. But for those that are intrigued by antiheroes and the ugliness of man's world, this is one of those films that you just have to see."

Travis could have had lots of friends if he wanted to,the guy just doesn't talk to any of his taxi colleagues.

","Known as one of the greatest movies ever made, Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" is one of the timeless hit movies from the 70s, and it's one of the first movies to put a mark on the career of Scorsese himself. In his second collaboration with Scorsese, Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran, now serving as a taxi driver in New York. Hallucinated by the world around him, the violence rages into his veins and is tired of what the world was offering to him. He even ends up helping a teenage prostitute, portrayed by Jodie Foster, in the process. The whole movie just focuses on his raging madness, on an unstoppable plan to murder the presidential candidate, and score back redemption. The full 113-minute running time is like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the most exciting, entertaining, and exhilarating movies ever made. Robert De Niro delivers one of the best performances of his career, and he steals the movie in every scene he is in. Jodie Foster also makes a pretty pleasant portrayal as Iris, a 12-year-old teenage prostitute. Rounding out the supporting cast is Peter Boyle, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks, and Cybill Shepherd, in a gorgeous performance as Travis' longtime crush. This casting ensemble is the ark of the entire movie. Starting out as your every-day drama, and ending as a wild and psychological thriller, ""Taxi Driver"" is quite a deserving motion picture. Martin Scorsese never disappoints, and he's one of the finest directors in Hollywood. He made such a good job making a movie that has everything that it wants to be. A script with some chills, a cast with some heart, unique cinematography and editing, a great soundtrack, and a thought-provoking ending. Now, there's a reason my moviegoers repeat the line, ""You talking' to me?"". Because this is the significant signature of one of the greatest movies ever made. ""Taxi Driver"", in my review, ""an exciting and thrilling crime tale""."

","Needless to say, Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' remains one of the most fascinating and intriguing atmospheric character driven pieces. Many have stated it to be Scorsese's best and perhaps it's one of the most quoted films. Paul Schrader's riveting screenplay is very detailed and layered. It's very much based on his own experience which is probably why it's so rich in atmosphere and depth and obviously, not to forget, the memorable lines. Scorsese does a commendable job bringing it to screen. Aweseome director that he is, he puts it all together wonderfully. The fluid narration, the haunting score (comprised mostly of some fantastic saxophone pieces), the brilliant lighting, solid cinematography etc work together effectively. Moreover, Scorsese definitely captures the rawness and stark reality of the harsh streetlife that Bickle witnesses every night. Robert De Niro delivers one of his most memorable performances as Travis Bickle. His understated portrayal of the title character is still a much talked about discussion. While this is clearly De Niro's film, he is aptly supported by a stunning Cybill Shepherd, Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle and Jodie Foster.<br/><br/>As I share similar opinions with the majority regarding 'Taxi Driver', I'll leave it here. But this is a must watch for those who haven't yet seen it, whether you're a cinephile or just someone looking for a movie to watch at night. Give it your full focus and experience it they way it was meant to be."

","Taxi Driver is often reverred for its pointed criticism of city slums, the hard lives of the people that inhabit them, and the even dirtier world of politics. Even in this day and age, much of these points remain true, and makes it almost ten times a more enjoyable flick, although it's definitely not age appropriate. Keep away from your children's. Somehow this film makes an extremely unreliable narrator, an insomniac taxi driving pervert to be a somewhat likable fellow. The night scenes are shot brilliantly and make it feel more like New York City for real, the freaks really do come out at night. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his role, but I need to understand one thing. Why does he shave his head? Why did he need a mohawk to gain the courage to go and fight the pimps and criminals, and then why didn't he keep it after all of that? I suppose it represents the changed side of him, but he was still a hero nonetheless afterwards. There still seems to be a disconnection between the meaning of his mohawk and the motivation of his actions. Either way I loved this film, I will make my friends watch it, and when I have children, they will too."

","Many of us enjoy films with a soupçon of controversy. But I'd wager that a film featuring child prostitution, handgun erotica, sexism, racism, bloody shoot-outs and a pervading ominous tone may be welcomed by a far smaller group.<br/><br/>As a teenager, 'Taxi Driver', for me, was always a deeply personal experience. It was cathartic. While other teenagers were drowning their sorrows by listening to rap music, I would revisit 'Taxi Driver' again and again. It is still, in my immodest opinion, the ultimate portrayal of loneliness ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle (De Niro) is jaded with people and New York, the home he loathes yet cannot bring himself to escape. He masochistically requests to drive his taxi for long hours, 'anytime, anywhere', so as to increase his abhorrence of the seedy melting-pot of scum the Big Apple has become.<br/><br/>Shunned by his dream woman, Betsy, for taking her to a porn film, he decides that the presidential candidate she is campaigning for is an apt symbol for his grievances. He resolves to assassinate him using his bought-for-one-purpose-only array of handguns.<br/><br/>When this plan fails, he befriends Jodie Foster's unfortunate character, Iris, who Bickle urges to leave the immoral world of under-age prostitution. However, being habitually under the influence of drugs and her pimp boyfriend Matthew (a sinewy Harvey Keitel), Iris makes unconvincing assurances to Bickle. The inequity, or perhaps the rejection, is all too much for Bickle, who promises Iris he will 'stand up to', i.e. murder, all those who are illicitly connected to her.<br/><br/>Pacing is deliberately slow to ensure we are completely absorbed in Bickle's world. The brilliant score composed by the legendary Bernard Herrmann, who famously worked and fell out with Alfred Hitchcock, is a juxtaposition of wistful jazz and brooding drums. It serves as a reminder of Bickle's inexorable decent into insanity.<br/><br/>Books have been written analysing Bickle's paradoxes. Why is he laconic and sociopathic in one scene, but articulate and sane in another? Is he a metaphor for the degeneration of a society that has long forgotten how to govern itself.It's this sort of layering that provides the depth of character examination in Paul Schrader's venerated script. <br/><br/>'Taxi Driver' can – and has been – interpreted as an anti-war film, a social commentary, a character study, a political statement and even as a horror film. I simply regard it as a warning. A warning, as the tagline ominously reminds us that, 'On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody.'<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"
"dee.reid","10","0","1","11 July 2011"," Robert De Niro is one messed up ""Taxi Driver""
","There are so few films as intense and cinematically powerful, and relevant, as Martin Scorcese's 1976 hit ""Taxi Driver."" The film is powerful, provocative, intense, disturbing, and violent. At the center of it, is a powerful, landmark performance by Robert De Niro as a mentally disturbed ex-Vietnam vet-turned-nighttime New York City taxicab driver named Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>In a city of well over four million people (and counting), De Niro's Travis Bickle character is so lonely, so unable to relate to other human beings, and so isolated from the rest of society that he might as well as not even exist. He takes to driving around a cab a night in an attempt to deal with an intense bout of insomnia. He also seeks a cure for his loneliness by attempting to date the pretty Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign volunteer for an aspiring presidential candidate who's running on a platform of radical social change. But his plan goes sour when he takes her to a porno theater and she refuses to speak to him afterward.<br/><br/>This tiny mishap pushes Bickle over the edge.<br/><br/>He's taken a radical dislike to what he sees as the ""scum of the earth"": the crime, the violence, drug distribution, decadence, sleaze, perversion, prostitution and general amorality that is causing the city to decay from the inside-out, both morally and spiritually. And it doesn't take long for him to begin to act on his violent impulses, since he now has an outlet for his rage. He embarks on an intense physical fitness regimen and eventually purchases a series of illegal firearms to aid him in his mission of ridding New York City of society's undesirables. That's why he's currently gunning for Sport (Harvey Keitel), the slick-talking pimp of teenage runaway-turned-prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster), which ultimately culminates in a bloodbath ending that truly has to be seen to believed.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" was widely acclaimed upon its release in 1976, especially after claiming the prized Palme d'Or at Cannes. But it was also heavily criticized for its controversial subject matter that included its ruminations on the violent thoughts of its mentally disturbed lead character and gore-laden climax. It is also not enough that Paul Schrader's screenplay was reportedly inspired by the private diaries of Arthur Bremer, the gunman behind the attempted assassination of George Wallace in 1972. It is also not enough that the screenplay is semi-autobiographical in more ways than one - not just because of its relation to a real-life would-be assassin, but also because the anger, rage, frustration, and isolation behind the life of screenwriter Paul Schrader also feeds into the film's pervasive anger, grittiness, paranoia, and oft-violent mind-set.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" may have reached the peak of its controversy - more like, infamy - when John Hinckley, Jr., a noted obsessive of the film, attempted to assassinate then-President Ronald Reagan in 1981, in an attempt to impress actress Jodie Foster, whom he had an obsessive romantic infatuation with. Talk about life imitating art, since in the film, Bickle makes an attempt on the life of the politician Betsy is working for (like Hinckley would try to do for Jodie Foster in just five years' time). Whether or not Bickle did this to get her attention in the film, is not totally clear.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is my favorite picture by Martin Scorsese, who also appears in a not-so-self-serving-and-actually-pretty-effective cameo in the middle of the film as a man on the trail of his adulterous wife, whom he plans to kill when he gets the chance. After this film, I would consider Scorsese's next great pictures (in order) to be ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). I would put ""Raging Bull"" (1980) in there somewhere but I haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Kubris","9","0","1","16 June 2011"," The mohawk!
","IMDb Top 250: 41 Taxi Driver. What a simple title. What do you think of when you read it? The ""talkin' to me?"" scene? Bickle's quietly psychotic, one sided smile? The suit? The spring-loaded gun? The mohawk? For me, it's the mohawk. There's a lot to think about in Taxi Driver, one of Martin Scorcese's best films.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is a slow film, or so it seems. There's very little action except for the end, and that can be a big turn-off, especially if you've seen other Scorcese films. But after you see the complete idea, things fall into place. Then you start to like the film. I saw it six hours ago, and I like it more each minute.<br/><br/>I realize the second time around the plot follows two paths: Bickle's downward spiral with Betsy and his... noble spiral with Iris. And when his downward spiral doesn't quite work out, he diverts that urge to his other arc. This view made my perception of the film clearer, knowing that the two plots bounce off each other. A second viewing is really beneficial.<br/><br/>Many things are great. The first and foremost is Robert De Niro. I believe this is the best work I've seen him in, better than Raging Bull for sure, in my opinion. Here, he is the master of subtle. The half smile, the casual hair, it seems he's just a quiet guy, but it's much more than that. It's much more beneficial to the viewer to know he's very unstable. Not insane, just unstable. It creates edge, and tension. You feel bad for him- he's a Vietnam veteran, come back to America, living in New York. He's lonely. It's sad. I find it unfair to call him a villain, as the AFI believes. He's an anti-hero. We like him, because of our perspective. We wouldn't like to meet him. He is Taxi Driver. This is a film about Travis Bickle's descent.<br/><br/>New York. That's where this takes place, and that's important. Most is seen through Travis' windshield, because that's all we need to see: New York is the spawn of scum. That's what we need to believe. Also, neon lights are everywhere. What helps us along are some blurry shots, locations, and the catchiest, almost overused sax groove ever.<br/><br/>Many people have praised Jodie Foster, but I really can't see it. She's in maybe a half hour of the movie, despite being so key to the plot that she's on the plot summary. *Edit* I just saw the film again, and I like her much better the second time. She's sympathetic.<br/><br/>The last act of the film, starting with the iconic mohawk, is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a shame it took so long to get there though. I would rate this film much higher if the beginning had some kind of action, tension or intensity, to show what was to come. There's no bang in the first hour, which makes the film less enjoyable at the time. Maybe if the robbery was earlier, or if Travis had a violent customer? There's a lot about Taxi Driver I can't talk about, it has to be seen. Post-viewing, it seems much more dreamlike than you remember, and in a good way. It's the small things that complete this, the things you only remember as they happen. If only it was more engaging from the start, Taxi Driver would be in my eyes, an untouchable classic.<br/><br/>This is a film about the human mind, and what loneliness can do to it. *Edit* After seeing the film again, it's grown on me even more. While my score still stands, Taxi Driver is a true classic that would rank higher on my best of list than the number suggests. 8.5"

","Taxi Driver is a psychological trip through an extremely interesting character study. Leaving viewers mystified, Martin Scorsese has crafted a superb movie.

The story never let's go off you (even the end will leave you haunted and wondering) and the lonesomeness of New York seen through Bickle is mesmerizing. It is filmed in such a way that allows you to see the world has the main character would, who thinks New York is covered with ""trash"". Travis Bickle also narrates the story, making it emotional and more than just a one-dimensioned story.<br/><br/>No one could have made this movie except Scorsese.

","Other than Goodfellas, Casino, and The Godfather, Robert DeNiro was in a slew of mediocre acting roles like Analyze This and the Focker movies except for Taxi Driver which he did brilliantly. This was a well shot, dark, gritty, and depressing look at late night city life and how people can be seedy, disgusting, and it's down-right depressing. DeNiro does a great job of having the best intentions and then, pretty much, becoming that he despises and wants to get rid of. I believe that, without DeNiro, this would still have been a well-done artistic movie, but DeNiro does a good job of making this more than that by getting you to come down to his view and root for him, even though he's kind of crazy. It's a classic and rightfully so. So if you haven't seen it, you should."

","I feel that Taxi Driver(1976) is somewhat overrated. I feel that it was very slow moving for the most part. It was hard to interpret the intentions of the protagonist throughout the majority of the movie. I kept feeling like something violent was about to happen, despite the relaxing jazz music. I was confused when Travis took his date to the porn theater, I didn't understand why he would at all think that a good idea. I feel that this film definitely stands out among other Martin Scorsese films in the way that the main character is developed; I feel that even though he was the protagonist, he wasn't a well-rounded character. As if I were watching a stranger the entire time, it was hard for me to feel any sort of connection to Travis."

","Lets face it this is a good movie (if your talking weird) in its own way but I didn't find anything disturbing about it. I found that the twelve year old prostitute made me very uncomfortable when(spoiler) talking about selling her crotch or unbuckling a grown man's pants but I guess that's the life of a prostitute. Anyway this could be a nineteen-seventy six batman film if the man didn't kill because hey who knows if batman loves porn or not. Back to the script, a 26 year old discharged military man that thinks an awful lot, writes in his journal and has trouble sleeping drives a taxi cab for money and travels through the bad parts of New York. As he sees the scum and filth of this city, he wants to do something about it but what? While he decides, he tries to talk to women but sucks at it so he stalks a woman at a newspaper center who notices him sitting in the taxi. This gives him the chance to be Dr. House and analyze her feelings which some how impresses her... Odd. Well not knowing a woman's worth nor movies takes her to an educational booty movie and she leaves him boo hew. Any-who he talks to a senator running for president about the scum and filth and surprisingly (sarcasm) could care less. So he runs into the 12 year old prostitute again(the one mentioned at the top. Note: the first time he saw her was on one of his routes though she was doped up trying to escape. The second time he nearly ran her over & then decided to follow her to a traffic light)and promises to get her out of the game by becoming a vigilante though the girl thinks he's weird (don't blame her). He goes and kills the pimps and all is well. It doesn't sound to exciting(because it ain't) but it is very interesting in its own way. DeNiro's acting as his character is very well done playing a young man who is weird and so on. I'd say give it a rent or buy it cheap on DVD ( trust me, it might bore you & you'll never watch it again),just don't show this to your kids as a lesson parents with sense(especially those with no sense.)Masterpiece, Not in my eyes."

","Taxi Driver is a great movie but I don't know why its one of the top movies on IMDb. The story to my perception is that it's about a young guy who applies to be a cabbie to occupy himself. He suffers from insomnia and feels out of place. He's certainly an odd guy considering how xxx movies seem like regular movies to him. He's looking for more in life. A purpose. And he's got a lot of bad ideas running through is head. Then he decides to buy some guns. For what reason I don't know and I don't think he knows why either. He then decides to be some type of enforcer. But who to enforce? Jodie Foster plays a young prostitute who seems to be held back by her pimp keeping her from her family where she should belong. Travis then decides to free her with extreme force. So thats Taxi Driver in a nutshell. The movie is very slow but interesting and a dark movie at that. Despite some boring parts, the ending seems to make everything you've seen worth it. The final shootout is painfully realistic which is what makes it so powerful. The scene is quick, bloody, and gritty like a real firefight would be like. Taxi Driver is well directed but not as satisfying to me as it shoud've been for such a high rated movie. But you at least have to see it for the ""You talking' to me?"" scene."

","I won't repeat what so many have said about this film. It is merely one of the best films ever made. I did want to share what I felt were three amazing scenes from the movie. <br/><br/>I heard through the grapevine that the actor who was to play the passenger during the scene where a man threatens to shoot his cheating wife did not show for the shoot. That is why Martin Scorsese had to take his place for the scene. Scorsese's acting is amazing in this short scene. Watch both DeNiro and Scorsese in this scene very closely. DeNiro is like a crouched cat ready to pounce. He says only one word in the entire scene...""Yeah."" Scorsese is very convincing as a man driven to seek revenge. Just an amazing scene. I repeat that scene over and over again in my mind.<br/><br/>The second scene is where Travis is purchasing the guns he will use later on. DiNero is a great actor...but this gun salesman (Easy Andy) steals the scene hands down.

"Cujosh","10","0","1","2 May 2009"," Hell on Wheels
","Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese, the 1976 Taxi Driver remains a disturbing landmark for the kind of voluptuous doublethink it helped ratify and extend in American movies. Of all Scorsese's movies, Taxi Driver is for me the most seductive, though I wouldn't call it either his best film (I'd choose the underrated The King of Comedy) or his most gut-wrenching (I'd pick Raging Bull). Most of the glamorous depictions of hell on earth and odes to stoical despair about a post apocalyptic civilization found in monuments to capitalist-urban squalor, including Blade Runner and Seven, can be traced back to Taxi Driver, and if it continues to exert an enormous claim on our imagination, this is surely because we continue to live in its vengeful, puritanical fantasies-as well as with the dire consequences of those fantasies.<br/><br/>In short, thanks to what can only be termed the transformation of Taxi Driver's experimental and European elements into razzle-dazzle Hollywood effects, the spectator is invited to identify with a violently Calvinist, racist, sexist, and apocalyptic fantasy, complete with extended bloodbath, that's given all the allure of glittering expressionist art and involves very few moral consequences for most members of the audience. Because the whole thing takes place inside one glamorous character's head, the social ramifications are effectively rationalized to the point of nonexistence. It must be added that the gorgeous and extremely varied visual effects Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Chapman derive from a yellow cab moving through ""hellish"" New York traffic are as central to the film's impact as its celebration of psychosis. Indeed, the two projects become intimately intertwined, impossible to distinguish."

","I am a certified movie nut, or I wouldn't be here, I must tell you that of the thousands of films I've enjoyed over the past 40-some years, Taxi Driver is hands-down my all time favorite! Never has a film had such a life-long effect on me. This film is so powerful, the director is, in my opinion, a living legend in the industry. The cinematography is unparralled, and it goes without saying that it's Robert Deniro's finest work! Travis Bickle feels like a brother to me, not some character in a movie. (relax, I don't own any firearms)<br/><br/>Clearly this is a very dark film with deep, disturbing subject matter. It takes you on a barefoot dance along a razor's edge, right along the sharp edge of madness. As someone else said on here, it is perhaps the only film that can take a sane person on a tour of an insane man's brain. If you've never seen this masterpiece of film, come take the tour of Travis Bickle's decaying mind, but bring a flashlight....it's a dark, dark place.<br/><br/>Go to the video store, RENT IT, but hurry....the meter is running."

","I first saw this film in college earning extra money via the student work program. One of my jobs at the time was the projector operator for whatever movie was being shown. One of the films projected was ""Taxi Driver"". At the time, I had no idea what I was going to see. Had no idea who Robert DeNiro was, nothing. From the first slow motion frames underscored by Bernard Hermann's genius soundtrack (his last), I was stunned; I knew that I was in for the ride of my life. I watched it then immediately ran home to retrieve my girlfriend, returning to fire up the projector and experience it again.<br/><br/>I have seen the film countless times over the subsequent years, and it holds up as one of the greatest American films of post WWII America. It is a perfect film, and like another great DeNiro/Scorcese collaboration, ""King of Comedy"", has moments of pure prophetic energy embedded into the narrative. A brilliant script, musical score and cinematography with equally brilliant performances by every actor in the piece, it never fails to deliver. Leading the cast, Robert DeNiro was a revelation. Amazing performances top to bottom. Out of the superlative ensemble of taxi drivers, Harry Northup always stands out as Dougboy. An actor's actor, Harry is spot on.<br/><br/>An absolute must see for any serious student or fan of film, ""Taxi Driver"" cannot be recommend highly enough."

"johnnyboyz","10","0","1","28 February 2009"," Take time to hitch a ride with this eerie Scorsese masterpiece.
","What a wonderful and timeless film Taxi Driver is, a film that delves into the human mind and gets stuck into the psychology behind certain living conditions and past events that still haunt. The film was written by a man then on the brink in Paul Schrader, but a man with a brilliant mind all the same whilst it was directed by one of America's more up and coming contemporary filmmakers in Martin Scorsese. The two minds come together and Taxi Driver is the result, one of my personal favourites and a landmark of sorts in modern cinema.<br/><br/>I wonder if Taxi Driver is one of, if not the, closest examples of an American film that is an out-and-out art film. A film that is shot on everyday locales with no intent whatsoever to prolong any sort of cause and affect driven narrative and quite deliberately focusing on the development of one individual who shares every single scene the movie presents us with, bar one. It's the sort of film that could very well have been happening as it was being shot and certainly, with events involving a certain John Hinckley in 1981, dug so deep as to inspire real life. In this sense Taxi Driver could well be compared to certain famous and recognised films found in certain cannons; films like post-war Italy's 'The Bicycle Thieves' and Mexico's neo-realistic 'The Forgotten Ones'. Shooting into the 21st Century, we have a recent effort from Mali entitled 'Bamako', again a film shot on the streets with no real narrative to speak of but a progression of a situation driven by politics and study.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver's anchor is its study of its locale as seen through the eyes of its lead character, Travis Bickle whom is played in a globally recognised performance by Robert De Niro, himself on the verge of greatness amongst Hollywood's acting circles. The space in which Bickle inhabits could be seen as a 'post-war' space; a space of which has become decayed and of a lower 'quality' through the government's focus on Vietnam happening several thousand miles away, something few people believed in as it wore on. As a result, the government's attention to its own home has waned and the metropolis that is New York City has become what it has become according to Travis himself, who incidentally chastises a politician for the state as to which the city has got to.<br/><br/>Travis Bickle is a lone soul in a setting complete with the sorts of individuals that make it more unbearable. There is a lot of gazing in the film, indeed the second shot of the entire film, and the first that doesn't establish the title of the film, is Travis' eyes following something as the film's theme plays over the image. Slyly, it is a shot at the very beginning establishing the general theme of observing what's around you and figuring a subjective viewpoint. What Travis sees is what he tells us through his diary entries and voice-overs as he drives past the subjects late at night, going through a list of derogatory words. Additionally, his fellow taxi drivers talk in an un-pc manner and the resentment is consistent.<br/><br/>But Bickle's perspective is only as distorted as it's ever going to be. Travis doesn't choose to visit museums in order to observe works or art or indeed go to the cinema in order to watch the latest movie in an attempt to escape life for a brief few hours; instead, he delves deeper into the grime and watches pornographic films in-between bumping into underage prostitutes and their pimps as well as organising deals with gun runners. What Travis believes to be the one shining light amidst all the garbage lies in Betsy (Shepherd), a woman working as a campaign volunteer for the mayoral candidate Charles Palantine (Harris) and the same individual Travis gave a lift to. His attraction to this girl brings about some of the more harrowing scenes the film delivers and moves the film, perhaps somewhat unfortunately, into a study of the stalker. But that only runs from him getting her out on a date to a certain phone call that even the camera is supposedly too embarrassed to eavesdrop on.<br/><br/>Scorsese shoots the film in a grimy and gritty fashion, using low angles and utilising the steam that pours out the vents dotted around the streets - an open sewer indeed. A lot of the film is shot at night; the daytime is almost an escape from the madness we're being forced to focus on through Bickle's own unhinged perspective. Bernard Hermann's score sets a perfect pitch for the film during the opening shots of the taxi gliding by, combining a smooth and easy to listen to jazz melody with a more brutal, more hard hitting grungy theme that beautifully sets in motion Bickle's overall mindset of this 'one thing on the surface' but is able to change into something far more violent all the same. Taxi Driver is one of those films anyone serious about cinema should see and it has remained right near the top of my favourites ever since I first saw it a couple of years ago and was blown away."
"CandidlyCandid","Null","0","1","23 February 2009"," De Nero And Scorsese In Taxi Driver
","They team up once again to deliver a well performed highly rated movie Taxi Driver. Robert De Nero again extracts and delivers as a former Vietnam war veteran, who is now driving a taxi through the unguided and disturbing night town of New York City. I must say I naturally enjoyed his performance in Raging Bull better than his one in Taxi Driver but he still does deliver well. The movie is general is partially overrated, I believe we see more of Scorsese's skill and talent in Raging Bull then Taxi Driver. There was more accurate cinematography, focused characters and better character development; but there is no excuse for Taxi Driver, De Nero's character was challenged and was developed well from the start to the end. The movie is somewhat predictable, but the movie ends off well. The talent and publicity was firing its way through after Scorsese and De Nero partnered up to make this. It was the start of a very successful career for both of them."

","This film is a truly modern reworking of classic cinematography. Yes - I know it's over 30 years old, but the shot of the soluble aspirin, the montage and overhead pan of the final crime scene - very new-wave and very well presented. The characters are perfectly researched and very well performed, the soundtrack is perfect.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that Bickle's character isn't properly developed at the start of the film. He's this ex-marine with a rough streak - but this is barely touched upon, instead the film presents him as some literary recluse - writing elegiac passages about his life in a diary by lamplight to a jazz soundtrack - and his character isn't like that - he rants about scum on the streets to Palantine - he takes a chick to a porn movie...<br/><br/>But that's all - I thought it was terrific."

","Some movies have the power and the immediacy to get into your head and wash way any preconceptions and reservations of how they are made. Movies like Gone With The Wind, Star Wars, The Godfather, and 2001's A Space Oddessey, are one of the few that can achieve this goal. With Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese, this film pulls you in and never lets go.<br/><br/>The premise of this urban tale deals with a lost soul living amongst the gritty decadence filled with sleazy, unscrupulous individuals, violence and crime. He goes about his days picking up fares along the way. However, his mind descends further into madness and anger until he finally....snaps.<br/><br/>What Scorsese has achieved is nothing short of amazing. The cinematography completely absorbs you into '70s era of NYC with an air of authentically mesmerizing atmosphere punctuated by on the edge lashing out fury with a riveting score that sets the tone of the film perfectly. Overriding this all is the stunning performance of Robert Deniro, who gives the central character of the piece a conflicting angst antihero whose only chance may be that of possible redemption is when he meets a a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster)torn between her family and the doomed society that she inhabits. Cybil Sheperd and Harvey Kietel give good supporting performances as well; although Cybil's is a little weak in spots but still tops it off.<br/><br/>This is more than just a film. It is a diatribe of a man who views the world as dark, bleak, and violent. It is the story of a man who longs for companionship. Ultimately, it is the story of a man who lashes out at the world."
"santoshbhoopalan","9","0","1","1 October 2008"," Travis the Taxi Driver
","This flick from Martin Scorcese is a deep study of the human mind, a true gem. But it surely requires an eye to appreciate it's finesse. So its suggested that don't by any chance watch 'Taxi Driver' on 'any day any time' basis. Watch it when you feel you can attend to the movie completely without much distractions. Because a true work of art like this film cant be completely appreciated with lots of thought running on our mind. Robert De Niro ( the master actor ) plays the central character of a night shift cab driver - Travis Bickler in the Post Vietnam New York city. And this film attempts to show the viewer the mental turbulence's Travis faces while dealing with his lonesome existence in the city. The audience actually gets to feel the whole existential crisis from a purely Travis's POV. The viewer also understands why its all happening, the situations are very human. Why Travis pushes himself to isolation?, why does he drive at night when he gets to witnesses all of the city's scum ? Is it intentional, does he want it unconsciously, may be. While driving at night he witnesses all kind of filth around - pimps, prostitutes, crackheads all of it. A very interesting scene is when a bearded guy gets into his cab ( Martin Scorcese himself ) and tells him about his wife cheating on him and 'What a .44 magnum will do to her pussy... that you should see'. All this while Travis seems to merely observe. Travis develops a liking for a woman - Bettsy a party worker for the Palantine, The Presidential Nominee. He approaches Bettsy while she is at work and asks her out for a date for which she agrees. When they meet up the other day Travis takes her to a Porno Theatre, Bettsy walks out of the movie real annoyed. While Travis tries his best to makeup, Bettsy seems too hard headed to give away. All this and other incidences kindle Travis's neurosis. He feels the need to take charge of things. He buys pistols and trains himself with them. In one of the scenes we see him acting out with a mirror ' You talking to me ? '. As he his getting ready for the battle we see him drawn towards a young girl - Iris ( Jodie Foster - Silence of the Lamb fame ) and seems intrigued by her. He approaches her pimp - Micheal ( Harvey Keitel - Reservior Dogs fame ) and asks if he could make out with her. Whats interesting here is Travis's disgust of Micheal and the long stare he gives him. Travis then gets to talk to Iris in private where he tells her how young she was and what young people are supposed to do. Iris a bit startled asks Travis if they can meet for breakfast the next day. They meet up and Travis points out what a lowlife she was leading and that she should return home. Iris sees his point and conveys this to Micheal only to be swayed back to prostitution. The climax and other events towards the end mark a good ending ( note:- not in the sense of the word - good, but in the sense of the reviewer). Overall a masterpiece , an interesting note though from IMDb Trivia - 'The story was partially autobiographical for Paul Schrader , who suffered a nervous breakdown while living in Los Angeles. He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns.' Paul Schrader wrote the script for the movie."

","How I had gone so long without seeing this film, I do not know but I am very grateful that I finally did because it's one of my new favorite movies. Sadly, I haven't seen too many of Scorsese's work but this is definitely the best of his films that I have seen. Taxi Driver deserves to go down as one of the greatest movies of this or any time.<br/><br/>I think the greatest thing about this movie is that it's so much more than just an entertaining movie that you watch with popcorn and forget a few weeks later. It is a very profound character study. It shows the gradual steps that it takes for the main character, Travis Bickle, to finally lose it. It does this so well and captivates the viewer almost perfectly.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro nails his performance and brings as much as possible to the character. Jodie Foster gives a great performance as well and so does the rest of the cast. This movie probably couldn't have been cast any better.<br/><br/>The best part in any movie, I always say, is the story and this film is no exception. It has one of the most well written scripts I have ever seen on screen. The characters, the instances, the dialog and everything else are almost perfectly written. It also has one of the most insane climax's that I remember seeing.<br/><br/>See this movie! There really is no other way to say it.

","When I saw this movie again a few years ago, what struck me the most-compared to when I watched it on VHS as a teenager for the first time-was the humour of this movie. Hmmm, maybe the humour is unintentional...I dunno. Funny in any case.<br/><br/>Here's a brief and (very) vague synopsis of the plot: a veteran of the Vietnam war (Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle) returns to the U.S.A. and works as a taxi driver. He forms relationships as a result of his work with two people on opposite ends of the social spectrum: a young, beautiful, middle-class woman (Cybill Shepherd as Betsy) who is helping a politician run for office, and an underaged sex worker (Jodie Foster as Iris Steensma). Perhaps the movie is part social commentary on the time of the Vietnam War...I dunno. In any case, Bickle seems to damaged by his experience in The Nam and by the world he comes back to. Towards the end of the movie, there is some gory violence, so, if you don't like the sight of blood, this might be one to avoid.<br/><br/>Now, for the real reason I posted up this review...to share the parts of the movie that made an impression on me: firstly, as a young teen, I can't really believe how I did not form a giant exclamation mark over my head when Bickle takes Betsy to a hardcore porn movie on their first date. Man, that is just SO funny, on reflection! So yeah...that's another thing I should mention-you do see some shots of what the 'love birds' are watching...and I can't remember how explicit it is-there is naked flesh though.<br/><br/>Lastly, another funny thing about this movie-who'd a thunk that taxi drivers discuss philosophy amongst themselves? And Bertrand Russell to boot! That's another thing that didn't trigger an epileptic laughing fit the first time I saw it. Hmmm...maybe if Bickle worked at McDonald's the scene would have been more believable?<br/><br/>Parting shot-De Niro is very good in this movie. Can't say the same for ""Mean Streets""-well, I mean that the movie is not that good, not Bob. He does have a great scene in Mean Streets where he reveals his true nature. Kind of like a similarly great scene in the Australian movie ""He died with his felafel in his hands"", where the main character's emotions bubble over the surface."
"freemantle_uk","10","0","1","20 May 2008"," Grim + Depressing = A Brilliant Film
","Taxi Driver is a brilliant film from the 70s and from Martin Scorsese, one of my favourite directors. This is a grim tale but is essential viewing.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is about Travis (Robert De Niro), an ex-Marine suffering from insomnia and becomes a taxi driver. He is a rather unpleasant, creepy character who spends his time going to porn theatres and stalks Betsy, a campaign worker for a Presidential candidate. He was unsuccessful with Betsy, driving her away. Because of his job he see New York in the depths of night and the city is very horrible and seedy, with prostitution and drugs around. This gives Travis the drive to do something and he is pushed over the edge when he has an encounter with a 13-year-old prostitute (Jodie Foster). He gets himself armed with weapons and trains himself up. He attempts to assassinate the presidential candidate before taking on Iris' pimp and try and get her out of that lifestyle.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver benefits from a good script, and excellent direction from Scorsese and acting from De Niro. It is a depressing story but that's why I like it. It has themes such as lonely, alienation, determination and mental illness. It shows the grim underbelly of New York and how horrible that city was in the 70s. This was from a man who loves New York. It is violence, but it does tackle dark themes anyway. I also like the fact that Scorsese cast a 13-year-old to play a 13-year-old, but I do understand why that is controversial. I also am under such whether to call Travis a villain or an anti-hero, but De Niro plays the role perfectly and he is one of my favourite actors.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver has also been influential in films showing darker themes and how nasty New York was. A good example would be Batman: Year One by Frank Miller where the author shows that Gotham was similar to that kind of New York.<br/><br/>The music of the film also had a film-noir feel to it and I thought that was really fitting.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is well worth seeing."

It's a blunt, honest wiew of a big city; some live, some try to live and some have no life left. <br/><br/>Harvey Keitel does some great work in this, the first times I saw the movie I had no idea it was him, he portrays his character with no problems as he always does. <br/><br/>The ladies that enters the life of Travis are also nicely portrayed and especially Jodie Foster, (like Keitel she is starring in an early role), does some outstanding acting against De Niro in this film. <br/><br/>Possible spoiler ahead now... <br/><br/>:::::::::::::::::::::::<br/><br/>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::<br/><br/>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: possible spoiler:possible spoiler:possible spoiler<br/><br/>Scorsese himself does a cameo, he does a guy with serious issues...

I believe it's based on a true story as well, haven't really looked into that but thinking about that adds to the feeling that De Niro's interpretation is a real person, the former marine that becomes the taxi driver and has problems with the social life, trying to cope with the depravity and the lost souls that dwells in the living hell that a big city becomes for an alarming amount of its residents.<br/><br/>This movie is a piece of history that doesn't feel old...<br/><br/>True force...all the kings men couldn't put it back together again..."

","As a text, this thing is extremely hard to get a grip on. Surely we're not expected to empathize with this lovable cabbie's bad analysis about human scum and end times, and surely the catharsis that he gets from his rampage at the end is not supposed to extend to the audience (or to Iris for that matter - can you imagine how bored she is once she gets shipped back home?) But just as surely, everyone on set agrees that things are f*cked and there's not much else by way of a solution. These points are made all the time, by filmmakers as well as other thinking human beings, without baring the least insight or interest. The point here, drum roll please, is that this is an incredibly layered and vital piece of film-making, one that takes off in directions that the script can't even begin to imagine. Part of this is that the dialogue is treated as complete, abject banalities that don't come close to expressing what's going on inside the heads of the characters. These characters don't have the verbal tools to let their humanity out - especially on the big screen, there is just so much meaning conveyed by the eyes, between lines. The stilted words are surprisingly comic, while the subtext is tragic. And meanwhile all this is embedded in the most gorgeous, abstract, kinetic and textured array of images that, I am prepared to suggest, has EVER existed in a Hollywood film - and I'm also prepared to suggest that the jet-black surges of Bernard Herrmann's score carry all the meaning anyone needs."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","1","1 April 2008"," 1976 is coming back again
","1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","This is one of those classics i've always missed out on seeing- everyone has a few movies that they get yelled at for having not seen, this was mine. Finally i've caught it and as is universally accepted, it's a keeper. Writing a review for Taxi Driver is a bit useless because I can't think of many more American movies that are so often critiqued or referenced.<br/><br/>One thing that totally blew me away though I will share. It was incredibly simple, and I'm going to say that it was intentional on Scorsese's part, because it's pretty genius. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, after Travis has geared up and is driving off to his bloodbath, we see a shot of someone trying to flag him down, which he ignores and drives away towards his targets. Now how many movies have you seen where a character tries to pull a cab unsuccessfully, with the cab driving away into the night? I tell you, every American movie set in a city. Taxi Driver made me think, holy crap, is every American cab that ignores a fare going off to shoot a few gangsters? I realise this is a big leap, but it was the first thing I thought of, and I thought it was insane. This repeated image (that i'm sure this movie further influenced) of a cab driving off after being called is given a huge new light. If you've lived in a monkey cave your whole life and don't know Taxi Driver ends in blood, the film itself builds and gives many clues to a very violent conclusion, still placing this image of the perpetual lost cab a nasty light."
"Ace2194","10","0","1","15 March 2008"," A Masterpiece!!!
","Martin Scorsese's superb character study of a rather disturbed NYC Taxi Driver, is one of the greatest movies of all time. Robert DeNiro has already been considered a superstar having done The Godfather Part II. Everything about this story was incredible and Harvey Kietel was great as the pimp of a young prostitute played by at the time a 12 year old Jodie Foster. This movie is just a way of showing what scary things a regular hard working man may see in the late hours of the night at NYC or anywhere else for that matter it just took place in NYC, and he decides he wants to go and clean it up. Also look for a great cameo by Scorsese himself as a weird passenger. Great film if you haven't seen it go rent it and watch it I highly recommend it."

","""Loneliness is following my whole life. In Cars, parks, sidewalks, everywhere. There is no escape. I'm God's Lonely Man..."" Martin Scorsese gave us the most frightening landscape of the city through the eyes of a desperate man who wants to be someone. A great screenplay (by Paul Schrader) , the most chilling music score from Bernard Herrmann , a tour dew force from Robert De Niro (I think that was the most aggressive and silent performance of his career), this is the best American film in the 70's (with no doubt that was the most sincere and ""elegant"" decade of the American Industry). A must to see (not to read about it) more than once to discover the insanity, the loneliness and the depression under the surface of the city 'till the extremely violent but not cathartic end."
"ChrisFennell","10","0","1","30 August 2007"," An iconic masterpiece...
","Travis Bickle remains one of the most iconic figures in cinema. His psychotic nature, profound intolerance and insomnia, are chillingly portrayed by a wired De Niro at the top of his game. While his role as the mercurial and masochistic Jake La Motta (Raging Bull) remains his finest hour, De Niro's performance is memorable.<br/><br/>The reality of a New York with a hot underbelly is very much realised, and it gives substance to Travis' constant alienation from his immediate civilisation. The first person narrative structure allows us all to be immersed with Travis' unnerving state of mind. He is 'God's lonely man'.<br/><br/>Scorsese's camera-work is especially riveting during the height of Travis' psychosis. When Travis has a gun in his hands, the camera becomes frighteningly close to the action, continuing this first person perspective that the film has from the start. Scorsese's distressing back seat cameo is a feat in itself.<br/><br/>Paul Schrader's script smacks with attention to detail and palpable tension at every turn but it would never have been as effective without Herrmanns haunting score. It beautifully adapts to different moments in the film, evoking a whole range of emotions."

So, i love movies, and i don't know who is Scorsese ...i mean , his work? So, one day decided to see a movie which critics - seems to me- support and hate. ""Taxci Driver"", that NY tale that we never going to forget, or well, not me.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is a tale about repression, about that human been who is bad for the same bad things that the human been do. The case here is about Travis, a Taxi Driver, who has a lonely life, and wants to stays busy working in his car, watching the girl he loves and dirty porn movies at the cinema. But, due to the circumstances, little by little, our character going to transform, not in a good way, although not in a worthless way. We see in the eyes of Travis the violence, prostitution and delinquency. As we see it for his eyes, we feel his own perspective of this things. This perspective is of disgust for the thing that he called ""filthy"". For other side, he is in loved of a woman who helps to a important politician. So, we find a man, at first, disinterested for the politics. Then, when his life turns violently by all this facts, his perception of life is centered in , what he same called as ""social cleaning"" or something like that, and this is not good as he thinks, because is a confused been. This smell bad. ""Taxi Driver"" is hard to forget for this (And more!).<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" treats an indispensable topic for a human been today, because the character of Travis is the clear portrait of thousand of confused people, like me and like you. Travis, is not a bad person, he has never been it. Travis - and i think that is the most importance topic of all - is bad for a society that turned him in this way. So, the blame of all is Travis? ""Taxi Driver"" manages every indispensable topic of a society like this: Politics, sex, violence and corruption. the vision of Travis is really important and truly, cant be ignored. Besides to be one of the cinema characters that i never going to forget. All his perceptions are of a desperate lonely man. My God! How hard but wonderful this movie is.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro (As rare ... Wonderful!), Cybill Shepard, Jodie Foster (After ""Bugsy Malone"" of Alan Parker) and Harvey Keitel are the most important performances, all of it great. This, my first Scorsese movie tell me how good is the vision of the famous director. Written by Paul Schrader with a soundtrack that we cant forget - although that the ending don't convince me much. ""Taxi Driver"" is that movie that we cant forget, and for this maybe turned to be in an instant classic. And for this, and to for its topic, i think that this is a wonderful movie that people should see for a best perception of society and recalled and famous message of ""The human been born free, the society corrupts it"".<br/><br/>Another necessary masterpiece for our lives.<br/><br/>*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any."

","""Taxi Driver"" comes to the screen on the year of the bicentennial of the United States of America. It should be a year of celebration, pride and solidarity. However, the atmosphere of this masterpiece from young Martin Scorsese (he was 33 at the film's release) inspires the very opposite. ""Taxi Driver"" wants to be depressing et pessimistic and its vision of America, especially of its supreme city, is everything but happy.<br/><br/>The story of ""Taxi Driver"" is about Travis Bickle, a young insomniac ex-Marine who takes a job as a taxi driver. He tours the streets of New York City, which are continually populated with prostitutes, pimps and 'Negros' from Harlem with the jazzy music of the pleasant Bernard Herrmann soundtrack. Travis' only wish is that someday ""a real rain come and wash the scum off the streets"".<br/><br/>It's Robert De Niro who plays Travis and he lives in his character like in a second skin. When we see him in the beginning, he seems to be absolutely normal and he looks like all of those innocent characters whose only desire is to have a good worthwhile job, even if it should be tiresome or boring. However, we can quickly perceive that he's the only person of his kind and he's also about to blow off.<br/><br/>Desperate to connect with others, Travis invites Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a pretty young woman who works for the electoral committee of Senator Palantine (do not confuse with the emperor Palpatine, even if the spelling looks alike), for a date. Travis, however, makes a gross mistake when he brings her to a porno movie, the only hobby that Travis knows.<br/><br/>After buying a rather unreasonable number of firearms from a black market vendor, Travis' mental state quickly deteriorates and he becomes addicted to violence with the miniature army that he bought and his days in Vietnam don't help him. He simulates shootouts in front of his mirror in his apartment and of these simulations lead to the now famous monologue ""You talking' to me?"".<br/><br/>Eventually, Travis tries to ""save"" a young 12Â½-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) by attempting to persuade her to free herself from his pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel with long hair). It's at that moment that Travis breaks down.<br/><br/>He shaves his hair and adopts a Mohawk hairstyle and he becomes almost unrecognizable. He attempts to assassinate Palantine himself (which would infamously inspire John Hinckley), and in one of the most terrifying sequences I've seen in my life, Travis launches a blood bath by killing all those who want to get too close from Iris.<br/><br/>Describing himself until that moment as ""God's lonely man"", Travis then gets a lot of attention in the media for courageously killing gangsters and saving a little girl from NYC's decaying culture and then sending her back to her parents. Everybody sees Travis as a hero. But is he really? By attempting to erase the 'scum' off the streets, he practically became part of it. It's a vicious circle. It's a pessimistic vision from Scorsese on the indomitable city of New York, a world without mercy where nobody can get off without being affected.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" is very bold. And it's for that reason that it remains so striking, even more than thirty years later. It's a very crude film. Its presentation is crude. Its vision of the world and of the city are crude. And especially, its violence is crude. We see little violence, but when it comes out, it doesn't leave anybody indifferent.<br/><br/>The violence that Travis manifests at the end of the movie is simply the fact that he makes visible to everybody what was previously invisible because it was kept hidden in his mind. We can assist to the deterioration of his mental state and we feel that he could crack at any moment. In the end, with good thinking, the violence that he shows is shocking and terrifying, but it's not that surprising.<br/><br/>It's definitely a worrying look, not only upon New York, but also America in its entirety. New York is not the only city in the United States and its problems are not unique to it. ""Taxi Driver"" is the story of an idealist who wanted to change the world and make it better. And he decided to do it without caring too much about the means.<br/><br/>The movie's ending is ultra-violent, but the bad guys are dead anyway. Is it a happy ending anyway? I think it's the choice of the viewer. Everything depends on how the viewer takes on Scorsese's vision. If the viewer decides that it's a happy ending, it means that he/she is optimistic and believes that it is possible for us to change the world in a good and significant way. If the viewer believes that it's a sad ending, then he/she is pessimistic and doesn't believe that we can really free ourselves from the mess that is American society.<br/><br/>In the end, it can summarized this way: if you think it's a happy ending, you're like Travis Bickle. If you don't, you rather are like Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>""Taxi Driver"" won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival in 1976. It's a fully deserved honor, because it's a really revolutionary film. I wonder that if it didn't win the Oscar for Best Movie (an honor that rather went to ""Rocky""), it's only because it was too hard for the jury's taste who wasn't ready to accept the reality or who refuted Scorsese's ideology shown in the movie. They preferred a typical film with a happy ending rather than a cold and cruel picture destined to cause some discomfort in the population.<br/><br/>However, it's a very enjoyable discomfort. Unless you prefer to live in your inside world."

","""Taxi Driver"" chronicles the life of Travis Bickle, a misanthropic Vietnam veteran who takes to driving a taxi at nights to combat his insomnia. This film is not for those looking for a ray of sunshine; it depicts Travis' descent further into mental illness as he becomes disgusted by the night life in the city seen from his taxi.<br/><br/>The film is engaging and thought-provoking from beginning to end. Even seeing Travis simply observing the streets in his taxi is immersive with the help of Bernard Herrmann's perfect score. The film's performances are all top-notch from Robert De Niro to the supporting cast. Robert De Niro expertly creates a subtle and memorable characterization in Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>This film has many classic moments, particularly the famous ""Are you talking to me?"" scene. It builds up slowly with nice touches such as the scrawled diary of Travis to an unexpected but satisfying conclusion.

","Taxi Driver<br/><br/>This is the movie that forever solidified Scorsese and De Niro into the minds of all cinema fans as film geniuses and legends and made them huge stars. This is one of the greatest movies ever made, a classic, and will be remembered forever.<br/><br/>Plot: Taxi Driver is about a man named Travis Bickle who is suffering from insomniac, loneliness, and maybe even a touch of post-traumatic stress disorder. He is also sick of the scum he sees on the streets every night on his taxi. This is a complex plot that needs to be payed attention to but is also one of the greatest stories ever told in film.<br/><br/>Acting: Along with the story, the acting is the strongest point of the film. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performance of his career(although it is nearly impossible to beat Raging Bull). His improvised lines such as the immortal words, ""You talking to me,"" show his ability to take a situation and make it realistic. He deserved an Oscar for this movie. Harvey Keitel also plays a pimp named ""Sport"" Matthew which is also a great and sick performance. Cybill Shepherd plays his potential girlfriend but I'm not giving anything away on that. Jodie Foster plays a controversial role as a 12 year old prostitute named Iris who Travis takes upon his shoulders to protect. Peter Boyle plays an elderly taxi driver who gives Travis advice.<br/><br/>Genre/Quality: It is hard to say exactly what genre this film is in. I'll put it in drama but I really do not know what genre it could be called. The quality is also visibly very well done. A fantastic score written by the late Bernard Herrmann, musically shows the deepening madness of Travis Bickle and the music of mid century New York City, and the dull life of a man who never sleeps. The camera work is great, with a beautiful crane shot near the end.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the greatest films of all time. I strongly suggest everyone who knows a good movie to pick it up.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This was Martin Scorsese's major breakthrough. For me it's interesting to look at this film, because I always thought, that his style changed a bit around mid-till-end-80ies. Recently I've seen lots of his newer movies, so now it was similar to seeing ""Taxi Driver"" for the first time, because I almost had forgotten how absolutely unique it is. This might be the definite film about loneliness and isolation, in its style it is defining urban film-making. It's paradox that surrounded by an uncountable crowd of people, people can cut themselves off and fall into biggest isolation. Travis Bickle is a deeply disturbed man, but ironically in the end he becomes a hero, whereas he could easily have become a murderer of the next president. Paul Schrader's script is close to life and full of tension. Scorsese's direction is extremely vivid (as are the colours of New York in this film), and full of great stylistic ideas. Robert De Niro's acting is outstanding. Bernhard Herrmann's music is romantic and threatening. A perfect film."

","I love case study films, and one of the finest case study films ever to be put on screen is Taxi Driver. Robert De Niro plays Travis, a loner who tries reenter his life after apparently serving his country in Vietnam. He takes up a job as a cab driver who drives in the seediest areas of urban New York city. He is disgusted by the corruption and sleaze around him and wants to do something but doesn't know what. His unbalanced psychosis ultimately leads to unending violence and rage. The taxi cab is a metaphor for loneliness in this film which proves true. All Travis wanted to do was to be a part of something. No man in the world ever wants to be left in society and Taxi Driver is a brilliant portrait of that. Great performances by the supporting cast too which included Cybill Shephered, Jodie Foster, Peter Boyle, Albert Brooks, and Harvey Keitel. Scorsese was great as well. His directorial vision was truly brilliant. Great Movie!"
"john-hugens","7","0","1","8 April 2007"," Robert De Niro is to film as Pink Floyd is to music.
","This movie is enjoyable. It is notable for its good acting, intelligent, but not masterful directing, and thoughtful ponderous score.<br/><br/>However, these elements in combination do not make a great work of art, nor do they qualify Taxi Driver, as one of the all time great movies. Yes, it was one of the better movies of the 70s, just as the Graduate was one of the best of its decade. But I really don't think anyone is seriously going to hold up De Niro to Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, or Marlon Brando in well, anything at all.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to suggest that De Niro's character is mentally unstable is preposterous. Yes, it's a bit out there for someone to shoot a political candidate. But given that it has been proved time and time again that in the right situation, 99% of the human population will kill someone sitting in front of them (this was found in numerous psychological studies conducted in the 50s, showing that most humans would shock a fellow human being until they were dead, for a small sum of money or approval from an authority figure), the character is not insane, or unbalanced. Simply, he knows how to shoot, to kill, and he is lonely without much else to do.<br/><br/>After watching this movie it is clearly evident as to Scorsese's many years without an Oscar. He is cognizant to De Niro's talents, and he lets De Niro run with the movie. Scorsese backs off, and lets the characters do the talking. Talking heads, do not, and will not, ever, making a great movie. A good movie, yes, but a great movie, no. Even Brando in On the Waterfront required a director that was willing to take the movie past the actors, and communicate using the camera more than schematically. What I mean is that while the cinematography was nice, it did not show much more than what was happening. For instance the shot at the end of On the Waterfront where Brando walks towards the warehouse shaking and barely able to stand up is not simply communicated using a locked down camera. The camera moves, shakes, jitters, and communicates with the viewer in concert with the actors. Scorsese, yes, uses some novel camera angles, but new camera angles, while memorable, do not communicate directly with the audience in a real fashion. Scorsese informs, there is more to art than informing.<br/><br/>In conclusion Taxi Driver is a very gritty, almost documentary-like, story of a disaffected man. Further, De Niro is able to convey a sensitive likable character who experiences many difficult situations, that almost every person imagines that they identify with (in reality very few men watching the movie ever prepared in earnest to shoot someone, and very few women watching it were ever child prostitutes, but the magic of movies is that they allow the viewer to over-extend and go on ego trips).<br/><br/>7 out of 10.

"PortugalOle7","9","0","1","13 March 2007"," So that's what a cab driver is thinking about...
","After watching Scorsese win his first Oscar last month, it dawned on me I had yet to see any of his early films. Taxi Driver was on the top of the list. A cult classic among De Niro and Scorsese fans, this dark noir tells of Travis Bickel (De Niro), a pent-up ex-Marine who takes the late shift driving a New York City taxi. Travis' long nights working in the seedy underbelly of the city begin to take their toll on him. Travis goes from a somewhat shy person, who asks out a young campaign worker (Shepherd) with the best of intentions, to a gun-toting madman. In the midst of his transformation, he befriends a young prostitute (Foster), who he feels somewhat compelled to try and save before the dark underbelly of the city swallows her up. All of this comes to a head in a fantastically crafted scene as Travis shoots his way past the young girl's pimp (Keitel) , the brothel's manager, and a client, all on his way to her room. As Travis sits there covered in blood, the camera starts to fade away from the room and the apartment building, police moving in. And of course a much talked about ending, which can be interpreted in many ways.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is certainly Scorsese's darkest film in terms of subject matter. It's a morbid look inside the mind of a man that is fed up with the failures of his society. However, a young De Niro is absolutely captivating as the deranged cab driver. It's fascinating to watch his mental transformation over the course of two hours of running time. Finding out that De Niro's ""You talking' to me"" scene in front of the mirror was in fact not in the original script, speak to the excellence of both De Niro and Scorsese."
"pyrocitor","10","0","1","4 March 2007"," God's lonely man
","Since its release in 1976, Taxi Driver has started to become somewhat misrepresented over the years. Being considered an indisputable classic, Taxi Driver has spawned considerable talk and speculation among audiences, mainly in regards to its violence, fabricating the film a reputation similar to that of an intense action thriller. But any viewer who sees Taxi Driver and dismisses it as a thriller has completely missed the point of the film. Taxi Driver is by no means an action movie fraught with gratuitous violence, nor is the violence the centerpoint of the story. It is the study of a very lonely man, isolated in a world of filth and corruption, and his struggle to overcome it. <br/><br/>It's very difficult to capture the appeal of Taxi Driver in mere words, as the film transcends them. The script, masterful as it is, is used incredibly sparingly, as director Martin Scorsese chooses instead to paint his masterpiece more in pictures than in words. As it is, the film produces an utterly unique atmosphere, so thick and powerful it seems to soak into the skin, drawing the viewer in, and holding them, intoxicated, from the film's iconic opening shot of a taxi driving through a cloud of steam to the film's craftily ambivalent ending (is Travis merely hallucinating, or is the film making a point about unlikely heroism?) to the end of the beautifully shot closing credits. As such, there have been complaints that the film is slow moving and dull for the most part - again, such comments merely bring to light that the viewer has missed the point. This is not a film about non-stop, heart pounding action. It is an atmosphere piece and a character study, using the careful, steady pacing to slowly draw the viewer further and further into Travis Bickle's world of loneliness and contempt, the monotony of his life developing a steadily sinister edge. Again, words fail to fully describe the sheer force and slow hitting impact the film generates, short of telling the reader to see it for themselves, to experience Scorsese's harsh but calm, unflinching view of city life in all of its grimy decadence.<br/><br/>Scorsese's simply masterful camera work is what really sells the effect, and Taxi Driver is arguably one of the finest shot films in cinema history. The camera seems to drink in the heart and jet black soul of New York city, from Travis' moody late night processions of the city, eerily beautiful in their quiet despair to the slow, famished sweep as he views his gun for the first time, perfectly backed by Bernard Hermann's exquisite minimalist score. It also goes without saying that screenwriter Paul Schrader's script is one of the most bleakly powerful pieces of writing ever transferred to celluloid, almost seeming to speak more in its silence than in it's brief but poignant bits of dialogue. From start to finish, the film is deliberately paced in a truly stunning fashion, allowing the mass of emotions to slowly wash over the viewer - it is rare to see a film so subtle yet painstakingly crafted. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that as breathtaking and essential the film's atmosphere is, it would be nothing without the iconic performance of Robert De Niro sinking it home. If De Niro was to be singled out for a single role in a career filled from top to bottom with flooringly powerful work, his sensitive yet brooding Travis Bickle would without a doubt always come out on top. Once again, De Niro seems to have more of an impact with what isn't said than with his straightforward and bleak nighttime voiceovers and journal entries; while his speeches about cleaning up the scum of the city put the viewer's hair on end, it's his eyes that really sell the role, displaying a haunting inner passion despite the blank apathy of his exterior; the most memorable shot in the film is Bickle, having just completely his cleansing bloodbath at the film's finale, raising a single blood- dripping finger to his mohawked head, and miming shooting himself - the sheer power of this brief moment is beyond description. <br/><br/>De Niro's stunning performance is backed up by several brief but incredibly memorable characters portrayed by the supporting cast, including Cybil Shepherd as Betsy, a seeming shining beacon of hope in Travis' dark and despairing world, Harvey Keitel's entertaining yet gut-churningly devious pimp, Jodie Foster giving an astonishingly capable and powerful performance as the child prostitute Travis strives to rescue, Albert Brooks in a subtly comic role as Shepherd's co-worker, and Peter Boyle as a down to earth, savvy fellow taxi driver of Travis. Director Scorsese also has a cameo as a homicidal passenger in Bickle's cab, proving to be one of the more memorable parts of the film, Scorsese's charismatic brief performance driving home a message of violence in the common man in a rather poignant and disturbing fashion.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver is one of the few films which defies comparison - exquisitely crafted by the genius of Martin Scorsese, it is a superbly moody atmospheric reflection on the mindset of one man, tortured by the crime and corruption around him. What makes the film perhaps the most interesting however, is however much Bickle may be billed as a violent psychopath, it's doubtful that a single viewer failed to identify with his views and personality at least once throughout the film. Travis' incredibly perceptive and sensitive persona seems to speak volumes on the inherent loneliness in us all, and the desperate, violent need to be accepted in a society thriving on distance, corruption and alienation. Do not be fooled into thinking the film is simply the tale of a psychopath, fraught with gratuitous violence - Taxi Driver is far too soulful and intelligent for such a predicament, and as such is worth seeing by any and every audience willing to stomach a harshly retentive tale of despair and redemption. <br/><br/>-10/10"

Very little dialogue is required, thus the audience is invited to interpret the movie how they wish.<br/><br/>Not before nor since has an actor had such an impact on an audience as De Niro. His presence on screen keeps you captivated from start to finish, truly holding on to your seat. Before long while rooting for him to do the right thing, you soon find yourself empathising and giving him your blessing to carry out what is ultimately to be the most visually shocking showdown in movie history.<br/><br/>It is incomprehensible that Scorsese did not receive an Oscar for this celluloid masterpiece.

This happens with actors as charismatic as Robert De Niro or Harvey Keitel, accustomed to to work with Martin Scorsese, and whose(which) natural habitat(environment) is the black movies(movie theater), or ""mafia movies"".Is necessary to emphasize the big performance of Jodie Foster, being an adolescent it was making to presage the big future that him was approaching. It has spectacular moments, as the attempt of murder of the president of the USA, remembering the mortal offense to Kennedy or the mohican look that Robert De Niro shows in the final stretch. An essential movie for lovers of this genre, with a big re-duck and with the spectacular director, who shows a New York of the 70 that was advancing towards the crime and the vice at big speed, and in that an unstable person was unable to escape of this underworld that him was making a detour."

"jguilho-1","10","0","1","21 January 2007"," Fascinating!
","Taxi Driver is a really fascinating movie, not just because of the fantastic direction and writing, but also due to the incredible De Niro's performance as Travis Bickle. The movie provides us a real picture of a true society drama, the loneliness of a man, who lived a traumatic situation during the Vietnam war. The whole picture is psychologically disturbing to the viewer and it's ending is very violent, as the climax of a disturbing and revolted person. Robert De Niro is really great and I think it is his best performance because he really lives Travis inside and outside, he is Travis. This wonderful ability of De Niro to disappear from himself into the screen and into the character he is playing is, for me, the most important issue that an actor must have to succeed in his performance. By the way, Taxi Driver is very well written by Paul Schrader. It's dialogs, it's descriptions about the lonely life that Travis takes are wonderful rich. Martin Scorsese is also an important person who made this movie epic. It's directing is synonymous of hard working, dedication, passion and a tremendous knowledge about filming... Loneliness, violence, anger against society, racism, love, mental illness, protection, politics, prostitution are many of the thematics taken by this historical picture, so well painted by these three artist and many others who helped to create this painting."

","In the early '70s, Martin Scorsese was a young director who was slowly emerging as a talent for being one of the finest directors in cinema. In 1976 Taxi Driver was released and provoked fierce controversy across the US, as well as a stunning amount critical acclaim, some naming it, ""a landmark film of the 70s"". Over the years it gained reputation for many things, the most obvious being the hugely iconic ""you talking' to me?"" and De Niro's epic performance of the lonely, Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver follows the story of taxi driver, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). A Vietnam veteran, struggling to accept the harsh, sleazy reality of New York slowly drifts away from reality and becomes obsessed with the idea of ""wiping the scum from the city"". It's a story that is structured with elegance and a slow ease. The script is memorable and flawless in its delivery, deserving the iconic status.<br/><br/>When I first watched Taxi Driver I was not sure what to make of it, I certainly felt it was a tour de force work, littered with excellence. Yet, I always felt something was missing and that I was one of a handful of people who felt it was nothing more than a ""good film"". Over the years I have re-watched Taxi Driver and it has slowly grown on me. On my fourth viewing it finally hit me that Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. Something caught me, full-on and I felt so naïve to have not realised it sooner. I've always considered Scorsese to be one of the greatest visionaries in cinema, I've always loved his films and yet, Taxi Driver was his only film that took me time to truly acknowledge.<br/><br/>Few films are as deep and offer so many re-watches with what is such a lurid, downbeat and disturbing subject matter. It's not easy viewing, yet it's a film that you'll be able and more importantly want to watch countless times. Few dramas are as fascinating and striking in visual style as Taxi Driver. The ability to engross you inside the mind of a mad-man and make you become the passenger in the taxi is astounding. You become apart of Travis' journey, a man plagued by insanity and yet one who holds frighteningly similar views of the revolting aspects of society. Except Travis is a man who takes it to the extreme because of the fact he has become traumatised by society and through society's transformation over the Vietnam period.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro is the greatest actor to ever grace cinema, he also holds the greatest performance in cinema for Raging Bull and in Taxi Driver he gives another one of his other mesmerising performances. Travis Bickle is different to many of the other characters De Niro has wonderfully portrayed other the years and prove his dynamic versatility as an actor. He pulls off his performances with ease and that's because he steps inside the shoes of his character. We slowly watch Travis Bickle's charisma change as the film progresses, we note the difference in his reactions to a situation and we also observe his manners and the differences in how he treats himself after having his rage bottled up. It's a performance that has the important depth which is a key part to the film; Taxi Driver is about as captivating as a character study gets. The amazing cast; including, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel give career highlighting performances, perfecting their on-screen skills.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver has a lot to say about the life we live in, giving us a portrait of some of the darkest elements of humanity. It's a film that bursts with its individual flare of film-making. The editing is sharp, clean-cut and filled with some beautifully haunting slow-motion footage. It's plagued by De Niro's poignant narration that echoes noir undertones and political insight. The cinematography is also astonishing in the way it captures the urban jungle of gritty culture. Then you have those magnificent metaphors; for example, the rain on the car windscreen to represent the washing away of guilty sins and the bubbling water to show the boiling up of suppressed anger. You've also got the tender score, mixed with a sleazy jazz ambiance which perfectly accompanies the experience. Martin Scorsese stamps his trademark of film-making style, making it impossible for another artist to plagiarise his work.<br/><br/>There are no doubts that Taxi Driver offers the viewer many questions and ones to study till your heart's content knowing that your perception of a film like Taxi Driver can always change. For me it's evident that Taxi Driver remains Scorsese's most difficult work for a viewer and also one of his most perfected. It's a pure and simple fact that Taxi Driver is without hesitation a true cinematic masterpiece. Few films even come close to the indisputable power and fulfilment of Taxi Driver. One of the few films that becomes a greater experience every time, it's a personal and essential experience of film art."
"wcdleung","9","0","1","6 January 2007"," The story of a majority?
","Why am I adding 1 more comment to 514 existing ones? I simply cannot take the movie off my mind 6 days after the viewing. <br/><br/>The movie eloquently pictures the loneliness that follows many many Travis Bickles in the real world. The narration is phenomenal -- thanks to a scriptwriter, a director, and a lead character who understand or at least who manage to empathize those lonely (wo)men. The most scary part of the movie is not the violence but the loneliness that is lurking and ready to ""kill"" people. <br/><br/>A more mediocre movie would present loneliness as unwarranted tears or some other exaggerated actions (most movie-goers want ACTION) (see Babel, for example). Here, the feeling is conveyed by the endless streams of views on the street, distorted by the windshield, reflected from the windows. These are views and people of an ""outside world"" -- untouchable and surreal -- while the protagonist watches ""inside"" (the taxi is metaphor of an inside space totally separated from the outside and is constantly going nowhere). That feeling's heightened with the few painful expressions or dazed stares of DeNiro, and the haunting background music. Do we need to zoom in the anguished face of Travis when he last talked to Betsy on the phone? Is that one-sided conversation not unbearable enough? The presentation is so much stronger by leaving it to the viewer's imagination, and shooting the quiet hallway, with no one around and leading to nowhere. (This second technique showing isolation is also used heavily in most movies by Kar-Wai Wong.) The movie is great in being so engaging, while very little is going on. In the first viewing of mine, I was overwhelmed by fear and suspense. In the second viewing, knowing more in hindsight, I was simply struck by sadness. <br/><br/>Life is slow and aimless, and people can be full of contradictions and void of characters. That's life. Some other commentors have problems understanding these, and I envy their blissful disconnection with such painful reality. <br/><br/>I am no fans of Scorsese-style grandness but this movie really surprised me. <br/><br/>There are certain parts of the movie that are overly sentimental. There are also plot holes. For one thing, the sexual desires of Travis is quite contradictory -- the habit of watching porns vs the hatred of prostitution, and the nearly unbelievable act of taking Betsy to a movie (would he at least ask the girl to choose the movie)? Or is he really so much of a walking contradiction as Betsy calls it? <br/><br/>** MILD SPOILER HERE ** The ending -- my guess, after seeing the documentary, is that, the film-makers literally meant what they showed since Paul Schrader mentioned that Travis had not changed, and the ending was the beginning of his next violent act. But most viewers correctly voiced the legal problems (assuming the movie is one of reality than fantasy), and some came up with a much better alternative ending that the last portion is the flash-back and wish of Travis upon his death (though the actual scenes don't support this well). If I were one of the film-makers, I would definitely let people take their sides, esp if that covers up an original plothole :) I DISAGREE THAT this open-ending is intended or is a sign of greatness. (Compare Birds, or Before Sunset, or Broken Flowers.)"
"xredgarnetx","8","0","2","30 December 2006"," An ode to the lonely and deranged
","Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER is an ode to the lonely and deranged, in this case a NYC cab driver named Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro). A Marine veteran and insomniac who is under heavy medication, Bickle is working up a head of steam about life in the jungle -- and NYC in 1976 was definitely a jungle, which the film's cinematographer captures perfectly. Bickle purchases several guns from a shady dealer and decides to kill a presidential hopeful, primarily because an aide to the candidate (the young and fetching Cybill Shepherd) has spurned his advances. What comes next is right out of a fairy tale. Without giving it away, let us say Bickle becomes a hero instead of a villain, like that nutcase Bernie Goetz who blew away his would-be muggers on the subway. Ah irony. This early Scorsese flick is really a showcase for the incredible talents of DeNiro. It also features a very young Jodie Foster as a cynical prostitute with whom Bickle becomes enamored. Foster won an Oscar for this role, as I recall. The film is dated by necessity. Much of what is on screen is now gone, passed on. Times Square was a cesspool when this movie was made, not the DisneyWorld extension it has become. Nevertheless, TAXI DRIVER remains extremely watchable, mainly because of DeNiro's intense performance. Harvey Keitel in a bizarre wig and hat has a small role as Foster's pimp, as does Peter Boyle as a fellow cab driver."
"toolboxmurder","10","0","1","6 December 2006"," For men exclusively
","For any man who has ever felt lonely, excluded or unwanted this is the film for you. I have viewed this film repeatedly and would recommend it to anyone with half a brain in their head. I won't bore you with a mindless summary of the film's plot, but rather include some personal observations that I as a white male living in contemporary times feels. I can relate to Travis' racism; his outsider feelings that basically suffocate him from the outside world. So often in films do directors and writers wish to portray blacks as some sort of innocent little lambs that require our pity or as victims of a horrible set of circumstance. Not in this film, instead we see blacks pimping, stealing, ravaging, ranting and basically screwing up in every conceivable way. In one scene specifically Travis is pointing his pistol at a television screen of a black male dancing with a white female on ""American Bandstand"" and repeatedly thumbing back the hammer to fire. This coincides with a similar scene in which a passenger (Martin Scorsese himself) glows with anticipation of shooting his wife and her black lover with a 44. caliber magnum, and revels in the very fact of his own hatred, desperation, and jealously. I myself have felt a sort of alienation from women of my own race and sometimes wonder if their is a vast, deep-seeded feminine conspiracy as Travis himself states ""She is just like all the others, cold and distant."" <br/><br/>There isn't any conspiracy, but all the same I get shivers any time I see this film or even think about some of its implications and it's incredibly memorable dialogue. I wish all films were as powerful and as gripping as this film truly is. It remains unseated even in these times of great independent film-making. So rarely does a film captivate it's audience with subtle implications and haunting imagery without spelling out it's message and it's thesis to a spoon-fed Hollywood audience, hell-bent on tagging and labeling every film that comes their way. This is a rare treat, and I dare anyone to watch it and intelligently discuss it from a standpoint of the 1970's and of 2006."

","DeNiro was lucky to play this part as five other great actors were offered to be in the role but turned it down. So DeNiro meets Scorsese, Scorsese meets DeNiro and one of the greatest movie bonds are formed. In this movie DeNiro portrays a psychotic taxi driver who is trying to turn his life around. he meets a girl (Jodie Foster) who is indeed a prostitute, and they fall in love so now the pimps are getting mad and this causes DeNiro to enrage which inevitably causes him to kill and become the man he did not have to be. It is indeed a slow pace movie but portrays New York life style beautifully and is on of Scorsese's greatest achievements."
"PWNYCNY","8","0","1","19 November 2006"," Dated but still worth watching.
","When this movie first came out in 1976, I found this movie to be absolutely astounding. But alas, time marches on and thirty years later this movie is a dated relic of a bygone era. The New York City of 1976 is not the New York City of 2006; indeed the same can be said for all of society. But that's not the movie's fault. Rather, in the ensuing thirty years since this movie was first released, so much has happened, and so many technological and demographic changes have occurred, that the movie is now passé. What was considered shocking then is now almost commonplace in movies today. For instance, the idea of a 13 year old girl being a prostitute certainly raised lots of eyebrows in 1976, but today would gain scant notice. Even the main character, Travis Bickle, being a Vietnam War veteran today would mean little if anything. Indeed, would a guy like Travis Bickle even be driving a taxi in New York City today? Could he even afford to live in New York? And would a guy like Sport be a pimp? Not likely. Nevertheless, this movie still provides a credible story about the effects of social isolation in an impersonal, hostile, violent, alienating and degenerate urban environment, which is the one thing that has NOT changed except for the worse, and for this reason is still worth watching."

","There is great acting.........and then there is Robert De Niro's portrayal of a lone soul in this movie. There is great direction........and then there's Martin Scorsese's direction of this movie. History has  it that some of the greatest and most intense works of art are often a positive result of an artists' despair, an outcome of his/her depression. I cannot find a better example of this then this movie.<br/><br/>To me 'Taxi Driver' is what Pink Floyd's 'Dark side of the moon' is to music connoisseurs.<br/><br/>Taxi driver is the story of a few weeks in the life of Travis Bickel a lonely cab driver in new york city who literally goes insane as a chain of events unfold in his life. The movie is narrated almost exclusively from Travis's view point, giving a 'panoramic' view of his character. Especially riveting to me is how Scorsese captures his utter abhorrence for the new york street life by giving the audience an extended slow motion of his footpath views as he drives.......and the effect is further heightened by the simultaneous background narration. An important part of this movie (and thats true for all Scorsese movies) is the beautiful soundtrack of Bernard Herman that ranges from soothing to intense, molding the complete emotion of the scene, the movie would definitely not be the same without it.The character of Travis Bickel was conceived when script writer Paul Schrader was going through a miserable phase. He was unemployed, heart-broken from his recent relationship, financially broke,and perhaps most 'importantly' .......... he was all alone. Locked in a room for weeks together, he plunged into the abysmal darkness of his heart. Diligently introspecting and in the process forming an unusual outlook to the world around him. He decided to put his feelings into a fictional script that would one day fall into the magic hands of Scorsese......the rest his history.<br/><br/>This amazing combination of Schrader's flawless script, Scorsese's unmatched portrayal of the dark streets of new york city , and DeNiro's almost scary 'so called acting' is a must watch for all appreciators of true art........"
"Major_Movie_Star","Null","0","1","8 April 2006"," This is what TAXI DRIVER is all about
","As the movie's tag-line tells us, ""On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody."" Travis is a nobody trying to become a somebody. His story is the story of what becomes of a man who aspires to be a 'knight in shining armor' in modern times. He wants to do good, and wants to do things right. His dreams set him apart from others, leading to loneliness and alienation. Modern society has no role for this knight; it frustrates his efforts, while at the same time the law allows evil (i.e. Sport and his buddies) to prosper. Travis Bickle would have been perfectly in place in medieval Europe, although he wouldn't have had the smarts or the skills or the money to be a real knight, but he could have been a successful warrior. The modern era provides the technology (i.e. his guns) that allows him to achieve the RESULTS of a real knight. Technology, therefore, levels the playing field, and allows the ordinary guy to be somebody (witness the various presidential assassination attempts of the 20th century, carried out by nobodies). The ordinary guy doesn't have to do anything special to be a superman; all he needs to do is buy a gun. His attempt to assassinate Palantine is a mad effort to become somebody. He apparently decided that Palantine was part of the ""scum"" problem, and chose him as the representative of the evil he had determined to cleanse. Also, he transfers his bad feelings resulting from Betsy's rejection of him on to Palantine. His decision-making is akin to that of Muslim suicide bombers, whose main objective is to achieve martyrdom, without necessarily being too concerned about the futility of their action on the earthly plane.<br/><br/>We are told that Travis spent time in Vietnam. The fighting there would not have suited him. He needed a straightforward, face-to-face fight, and it is likely that the war in Vietnam broke him. The streets of new York offer him another chance to become a knight, fighting on his own terms. But to him,as a result of his experiences, death is now more real than life. More than a knight, he has the mentality of a kamikaze or an islamist suicide bomber. His death would be of little consequence to him, as the attempt on Palantine makes clear enough; he runs away not because he is afraid of death but because he is afraid of failure, capture and punishment.<br/><br/>Sir Travis's Fair Lady is split into two persons. Betsy is his fair lady, proper. But due to the class differences between them, it is difficult to contrive a situation in which she can also be the damsel in distress. So, Iris is his damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Travis's heart is in the right place (more or less), but he is misguided. Iris is the prisoner of her own foolishness; there is nothing to prevent her from leaving, if she really wants to. Travis didn't have the right to shoot Sport in the gut like that. Usually scriptwriters contrive situations so that the hero is always obliged to kill in self-defense. America's true spiritual foundations are legal, not moral, and so America has become the Land of Pretext where you can do anything you like to your neighbor, just so long as you can provoke him into giving you an excuse/opportunity. But Taxi Driver is written (rather clumsily) to bring ambiguity into the situation. That is why the scriptwriter has Travis shoot Sport in the gut instead of the head; he does not kill him outright (which would have made Travis an outright villain) but he lets Sport live long enough to take a shot at him, so that Travis can blast him again in ""self defense"". Unfortunately this movie has helped condition the American mind toward pre-emptive violence, which has found it's fruition in the attack on Iraq, with more attacks to come. <br/><br/>In the end, despite his mental illness, lack of intelligence, clumsiness, and naivety, Travis achieves a measure of success by his sheer guts. He has certainly cleaned scum off the streets, and the scriptwriter has seen to it that the scum have no redeeming virtues, so we are not sorry to be rid of them. Travis has also won the respect--if not the heart--of his fair lady, and has grown to the point where he no longer needs to earn her approval. We only hope that he has grown and learned from the experience. In reality, Travis would have been charged with murder for what he did. Consider also that Iris's life was probably wrecked altogether by the experience; like any modern jihadist, Travis's mind is focused too much on achieving his jihad against the street scum--on becoming somebody--and focused too little on the consequences of his actions for other people. He is a hero who has--to a large extent--behaved like a villain, but he is excused any wrongdoing, and there is plenty of hope for the future."

We are shown the problems in the American society, loneliness, corruption, isolation through the eyes of one man who crumbles under the urban jungle of 1970s New York. Taxi Driver may also be a slap on the face regarding the Vietnam War. Soldiers, like Bickle in the film, travel 11,000 miles to fight Communism in the jungles of the Vietcong, only to return dehumanised into a constant war on the streets, because many soldiers didn't return to no fancy fireworks and a home by the lake - maybe I'm just going too far. <br/><br/>In 1976, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences opted for Rocky, the boxing fairytale, an injustice towards Taxi Driver, which was clearly the most superior motion picture of the year.

I'm sorry, but maybe I'm just looking for something that i cannot see. I'm about to watch ""the graduate"" now, I hope this one doesn't fail me.

"elsinefilo","Null","0","1","19 November 2005"," gritty realism powerful performances but a possible fantasy ending!
","""Taxi Driver"" is one of the very rare films that caught my attention with powerful performances and dark gritty realism. Even though I don't know the feeling of living in a city which has a dark seedy--at least visible-- side I can say it is not a typical American flick. You do not see a hero who kills bad men and achieves something good in the world of wickedness! You do not see just action which may be pretty goony in any film. You do not see just philosophical inner monologues but you feel you are just involved the story of Travis. Travis is an alienated guy who tries to comes to grip with the socially disoriented world around himself. He suffers from insomnia and consequently takes a job as taxi driver and volunteers to work the overnight shift ""anytime, anywhere"". Travis spends his spare time watching pornography in seedy theaters and driving around aimlessly through the darkest and most repulsive neighborhoods of Manhattan.While he just drives through these detestable neighborhoods of the town we witness the seedy side of the town and we feel the struggle of a frustrated lonely guy against the cold and distant world. The only thing that the movie lacks is the ambiguity of its ending. Roger Ebert has written of the film's ending, ""There has been much discussion about the ending, in which we see newspaper clippings about Travis's 'heroism', and then Betsy gets into his cab and seems to give him admiration instead of her earlier disgust. Is this a fantasy scene? Did Travis survive the shoot-out? Are we experiencing his dying thoughts? Can the sequence be accepted as literally true? ... I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Scorsese's characters."" <br/><br/>I am not sure it is practically true either. In that way it reminded me Barton Fink which sounded like a sophisticated joke to me when it ended coz I had not figured out which part was fantasy which part was reality. Watch and decide I would say!"

","Having seen this film at a relatively young age i was not too keen on it, just seeming to build up to some sort of action but never quite getting there. However i saw it recently (having established faith in director Martin Scorsese) and was amazed by it.<br/><br/>The most amazing is the role of Travis Bickle played by Robert De Niro in the fairly early flushes of his up and down acting career. De Niro at this point in his life ever the perfectionist (method acting et al), becomes the character he is portraying, a confused, insomniac ex Vietnam soldier who works as a taxi driver.<br/><br/>All around him he sees a sleazy New York from his taxi and examines it through the eyes of someone who thinks that he can do something about it. The whole of the film is himself building up to doing something about cleaning the streets of the filth and scum that have enraged him. In between all this, Travis is shown as someone who fails to understand other people. He manages to get a date with the Cybill Shepherd character Betsy but takes her to a porn movie, yet he cant understand why she is offended. After that he is seen considering and toying with his mind what to do after Betsy doesn't want to know him, and the idea of killing a potential Senator (Charles Palantine, played conservatively by Leonard Harris) who Betsy supports. Almost goes through with this but doesn't.<br/><br/>The short scenes he has with Jodie Foster who plays underage prostitute Iris, are very interesting, a typical almost father to daughter chat of Travis to Iris. It is the conversations he has with her that leads him to try and rid her of her pimp Sport played by Harvey Keitel in a small but vital role.<br/><br/>The major shootout between Travis and the 'scum' he sees in an apartment where Iris is fairly tame by todays standards but at the end of the film when he has been shot a few times himself he mimics putting a gun at his head and pulling a trigger, to which then fades to newspaper cuttings about him being a local hero, which then fades to him being back in his taxi and driving Betsy somewhere.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the ending, i don't know the official word on it but i believe after the shoot out near the end the rest of it is played out in Travis's own mind before he dies from his injuries.<br/><br/>A classic film, very dark in content, and worth viewing a few times before either dismissing it or loving it."

","This is one of my all time favorites. I still remember how I was glued to the TV set while watching this movie and going through the same emotions as the taxi driver. Maybe I liked the movie so much because I was going through a similar phase in my life; ""The phase of utter despair, loneliness and a search for the purpose of life"" which I guess everyone goes through at some point or the other. Maybe the movie is so powerful and involving that I just felt that I was going through a similar phase.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro gave a top notch performance and Martin Scorsese directed it with a passion. The movie moves at a leisurely pace highlighting the mundane and repetitive aspect of a taxi driver's life and gives you enough time to get into the skin of the characters and experience what they are going through.<br/><br/>Although 'are you talking to me' is the most famous scene of the movie but I can never forget the scene in which De Niro starts rocking the TV set by his foot and then just lets it fall and crash. That scene really shook me and for that moment I was Travis himself identifying with all his anger and frustrations."

","Well I am a high school student and I take a film class and being a huge movie buff i was shocked that Taxi Driver was not in our curriculum.<br/><br/>Anyway one of the main reasons I love this movie is due to its keen insight into the political mind. Travis's view on the corruption in the world boils over and he clearly goes insane. The movie digs deep into the soul of a political mind which makes the movie just that much more enjoyable to watch. Travis trains for his war, yet while training has not decided who he will attack the Senator who he does not believe will do an adequate job solving the removal of the scum which lurks in New York, My hometown :). Or should Travis attack the drug dealers dealing with the problem directly. Killing the Senator is a very democratic thing to do, instead of dealing with the problem directly he attacks the person who Travis could trace the source of scum too. The republican way would be to jump in and try to solve the problem directly. Travis chooses to not kill the senator knowing that he would be caught for sure. Of course the irony of the movie lies within him killing ""innocent"" drug dealers so he can take out his aggression on the world. This makes him an radical republican, he kills drug dealers and pimps, who technically are wrong doers but if you really think about it they are not farther out of like then any other pimps and although they deserve to be in prison they don't deserve to die. Travis choice to be a republican over a democrat frees Jodie foster which killing the senator wouldn't of solved. The further irony lies within the world praising him for killing 4 pimps even though they did not directly do anything to hurt him. Of course the people who praise him are unaware that if possible he would of killed the senator. Travis is insane, but re stabilizes through killing. Which hits upon man's primal instinct to kill. It is hard for me to define what the movie truly says about the political parties but nevertheless it is an epic film that can create tons of thoughtful conversations and sleepless nights."

But to Travis it's not murder, it's war.

They are standing outside a diner about to go on their Taxi routes.  Travis keeps saying that he is going to do something...something (and he can't put it into words).  He is clearly frustrated and his anger is close to the surface.  He is desparately trying to tell Wizard that he is going to do ""something.""  Wizard clearly sees that Travis is upset and frustrated.  He looks at Travis and says.  ""You know what your problem is, Travis?""  He continues...""You think too much."" Wizard finishes the discussion with ""Don't think so much.""  Like many scenes in this movie, they sort of get by you without you fully understanding the weight of the moment.  When Wizard tells Travis that he thinks too much (as a simple observation), he is really saying something about Travis that is both profound and comprehensive.  Travis' sensitivity to the world around him is so overwhelming that he cannot sort it all out, no matter how hard he tries.  He is left to express his anxiety and frustration in only one way...through violence.<br/><br/>Is Travis a hero or a villian?  This is the theme of the movie.

","In this brillant movie the creators (Scorsese-Schrader) introduced strong parameters to invert the way to see good and evil. The principal character (Travis / Robert De Niro) could be a `hero' and at the same time be completely evil, it depends our point of view. Robert De Niro composed one of his best roles, memorable, anthological. And there´s another way to observe the movie: the religious way. Catholic God becomes very upset and sent a Revenge Angel to put the order of the human world again on the way. New York, considered one of the first cities of the `New World', is the perfect place to show how the human beens lost his spiritually. Travis -first taciturn and polite- becomes the eyes of the spectator, our eyes, and then he start suffering like Christ but he can´t stand this, so he turned to be the hand of Spiritual Justice. He do all `we want to do' when we saw the scum of the streets, the lies of the politics or a woman so ungrateful: Kill with the Sword of Justice. But he is a man, he is an ex-marine who was in Vietnam´s Inferno for his Ungrateful Country, a poor simple boy with nothing to do... except one thing. He can `see' the things with innocence and perspective at the same time. The Cab is his `house' and the Night his be st moment -a spirit of the night-, he has a name but it seems that he came from nowhere. He is real and a ghost at the same time. Each tackle is a personal problem to solve for Travis, each person became his personal difficult task to do. The camera an the edition are both technically perfect showing the particular character´s behaviour. The eyes of Scorsese an his personal way of filming show early evolution, complexity and subtle. With this film one of the best american (and wolrdwide) directors composed a remarkable movie.<br/><br/>There´s more: Bernard Hermann´s outstanding `bolero' music making a perfect ambient -his last work -; excellent Schrader´s script and talented support actors like Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd and young Jodie Foster; all of this contributions showed one of the best portrait of the American Nightmare with polished style, magnificent work, strongly expressive."

Robert De Niro plays the Anti-hero Travis Bickle, the typical everyman, with skill and intensity. Jodie Foster shows her early acting chops as a prostitute that Travis fancies. The city of New York in the 70's is practically a character in the movie and is shown in all it's gritty glory. Travis grows tired of watching the human scum polluting the city get away with everything and decides to take matters into his own hands. The result is a view of the transformation of the character that De Niro handles with aplomb. The movie deserves all the kudos that it gets in the media and is well worth viewing. Bottom Line: You can't call yourself a movie fan and not have Taxi Driver on your shelf. Movies this good are rare and worth appreciating."

","**Some spoiler**<br/><br/>I was excited to find this one playing late one night on Encore.  I had heard many good things about it and I knew it was generally acclaimed to be one of the top 50 movies of all time.  After watching it though I was thoroughly dissatisfied.  There is truly nothing really special about this movie.  Our ""hero"" (some may consider a villain) is the same guy you knew at high school who struck you kind of funny and frankly scared you that he'd one day violently massacre lots of people in some kind of one man holy war against the ""demons"" of the cruel world we live in.  But I could accept that.  the problem here is that he doesn't do anything.  His motive for violence is pimps, senators, and scornful women (?) to save the world for prostitutes everywhere (?) and clean up the streets (?).  All we ever really know in this movie is that the guy is crazy.  How crazy?  The kind of crazy that watches alka-seltzer bubble.  So in the long run we don't even know how crazy he is or even what type of crazy.  <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is him scribbling unintelligible ramblings about the few thoughts he seems to have during his 24 hour a day life and having the most ridiculous, absurd conversations that don't go anywhere.  Since there are no witty characters (or even halfway smart) in this, there is absolutely no interesting dialectic at all.  In fact aside from the ""You talkin' to me"" bit, there is nothing interesting ever said.  This may or may not have been on purpose, but regardless it makes sitting through this movie a little bit harder.  <br/><br/>In the end he decides instead of getting revenge on the girl who dumped him by killing a senator (?), to shoot down some pimps to save a prostitute who is acted by Jodie Foster (If you can stand, or even like, Jodie Foster you may not have a problem with her bad acting here) and he does so with every intent to be some kind of martyr for slow people like him everywhere.  I got the point of the movie, it's about as deep as a kiddy pool.  The point of the movie is we get to see partially inside of the life of a crazy guy who's not too bright and, since his character can be summed up in one sentence with few adjectives, also very 2-dimensional.  And inside we see that crazy people are dangerous, especially when they're not too bright and scorned by women.  This movie is decent, but far from even a top 200 list of movies in my book.

","Ok, now I saw this movie for the first time when I was 16 and I have to admit I was rather unimpressed with it. I found it to be a leaden, disorientated trudge through the dregs of New York. I thought that Travis Bickle was an underdeveloped and incoherent character who never gave us a satsfactory reason for his psychological collapse. ""But that was then - hell I liked the Matrix back then and I even gave the Two Towers a second chance"" I thought. So I gave it another whirl.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did. Taxi Driver is one of the most atmospheric and intricately explored character studies in American cinema. Scorcese drags the audience through the gutter and pulls no punches in his portrayal of NYC and its denizens. He highlights Bickle's(DeNiro) increasing detachment from society by jamming him in the corner of his shots, even placing him off camera at times. This is offset by a more subjective POV in scenes where Bickle is alone...Bickle's fantasy of being a 'somebody' manifests itself in how he perceives himself in the guise of a movie star, best illustrated in the iconic ""You talkin to me"" mirror scene. This is further illustrated in scenes where entire crowds turn their heads to look at his taxi....he tells hiss parents that he cannot reveal ""his location due to the sensitive nature of his work for the government."" Evidently his grasp on reality has suffered a blow because of his failure to fulfil 'the American dream' - some say its the after effects of the Vietnamese war that have caused this, I don't think this is true largly because Bickle is an unreliable narrator - he may never actually have been in the army and even if he was he may never have seen combat after all his gunmanship certainly leaves a lot to be desired. Essentially Bickle has deluded himself into believing that he may be ""the rain to wash all this filth away"". Look at his intervention with Jodie Foster's young prostitute or his relationship with Cybil Shepard. Clearly he sees himself in the guise of a modern day messiah. When it ended I was left in awe at the skill with which this movie was made the acting and direction was first class and Paul Schrader's screenplay was wonderfully ambiguous. The moral?

Thankfully with have prime-time De Niro in the lead, one few actors that can go crazy without totally alienating the audience.<br/><br/>While many focus on the nonsensical ending as their main quibble, mine is with the main character. If you want to condemn sleaze you have to do so from a position of being above it or beyond it: Our anti-hero seems to be right at home in the gutter with drug dealers, pimps, whores, gun sellers, porn theatres and general riffraff.

What are we learning here - that Times Square was (it has been cleaned up since) a sleaze pot? Or that the big city has an ugly underbelly? How stupid and ignorant does Scorsese think we are?

The beginning and middle of the movie where Bickle encounters seedy characters that add to his rage against the ""scum"" of New York enable the viewer to believe the obvious. That Bickle will go on a killing spree eventually dying himself. Well, I'm not going to spoil the ending but that doesn't happen. In fact the ending in my opinion is in complete contrast to the character we were lead to believe was Travis Bickle for 3/4 of the movie. The ending was flat out punchless."

","*Major spoilers*<br/><br/>No matter how down you're feeling, chances are your life is nowhere near as pathetic as Travis Bickle's. He is one of the classic cinematic antiheroes. He can never fit in the modern world. From the start of ""Taxi Driver,"" all his attempts at human communication are destined to fail. At one point he attempts to strike up a relationship with a woman, but he blows it by taking her to a porno theater on the first date. Seldom has so promising an opportunity with a woman been so utterly squandered. One is hard pressed to imagine that anyone could be so unimaginably foolish. The only possible explanation is that he is subconsciously sabotaging himself. This memorable scene strikes home the extent to how out of touch he is with reality, and his inability to fit in society as well. He does not seem to be part of the world, but a traveler from a strange land, observing all. He doesn't even fit in too well with his coworkers, although they do manage to be civil. In the meantime, his frustrations build up...and something will give sooner or later...<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro was robbed of an Oscar for his chilling, multilayered portrayal of Travis. His character could easily have descended into parody, but he strikes the right note in every scene, resulting in an uncomfortably believable portrait of urban alienation. Even at his worst, we are allowed to sympathize with the character; he is not an evil person, but a sick person whose troubles have exceeded his ability to cope. Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader refuse to judge any of their characters, not even Travis. Chances are, he was once a much more well-adjusted person before going to war, at times this other side of him can be glimpsed, fighting to get out. Travis does try to do good, but his mental illness invariably drag him down further and further. He is in the grip of forces beyond his control. Even his failed attempt to assassinate a presidential candidate is another desperate attempt to break out of his condition. <br/><br/>The film also boasts a pair of fine supporting performances. Jodie Foster (as Iris) pulls off the difficult part of a teenage prostitute with more skill than some adults would have demonstrated in similar roles. Her rapport with DeNiro is believable, never taking a misstep. They are two kindred spirits, adrift in a hostile world, and it is only natural that they would get along so well. Indeed, she seems to have coaxed out Travis last trace of humanity before his descent into madness. Harvey Keitel plays her pimp, stealing every scene he's in, and one can only wish he had a bit more screen time. He gives the character a degree of moral ambiguity--is he using Iris, or does he genuinely care for her? No easy answers are provided. I am not a big fan of Sybill Shepherd, but she turns in an adequate performance as the subject of Travis' unrequited love. Albert Brooks gets the most thankless role, as Shepherd's nerdy coworker; their scenes together are the only ones that don't quite work, but thankfully the whole business is dispensed with fairly early on. Leonard Harris is solid as a naive politician. Finally, there are memorable cameos from Joe Spinell and Scorsese himself.<br/><br/>The director creates a portrait of New York City as a desolate, hostile world of its own. He establishes a grimy, gritty atmosphere, thanks in part to Bernard Herrmann's haunting, melancholy jazz score. His visual style is much more subtle than his more recent work, but after repeated viewings the film grows on the viewer. I admit I didn't quite get into it at first, yet I kept watching it again...and again...and again...<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Columbia Pictures"

It just wouldn't go down that way. He'd end up having tea with nurse Ratchett for a very long time. Scorcese is an overrated director who had a ridiculous number of films entered in 'the best films' encyclopedia in my local reference library. The only one they missed off was 'Alice doesn't live here anymore', which is the only one I like. Of course, it's about a women and not the usual macho fantasies, which I reckon is the reason why he's so unjustly popular with the critics. They'd all love to be one of those guys. Scorcese plaigarised this ending for 'King of comedy' and with incredible lack of imagination remade 'Goodfellows' in another three hour gangster film called 'Casino' with more or less the same message and ending.

","About this vastly overrated ""classic."" There's just nothing here beyond clever film-making trying to disguise a hopelessly thin screenplay. What do we have? Travis, borderline psycho to start the movie, goes completely psycho. No real reason given for it. He's full of hate at the beginning of the movie, he's full of hate at the end. No evolution at all. No convincing reason for him to go on a wild shooting spree. No convincing reason for him not to. The film is just one boring, pointless scene after another, often feeling like a really bad art film where the characters emptily mouth lines that the writer must have felt were deep, profound, and meaningful, but aren't, really. And so damn many times the characters *repeat* themselves, stretching 30 secs of dialog to 2mins of annoying chatter.<br/><br/>Irony? Travis has none. And even if he did, De Niro doesn't do irony very well. Travis is a typical one-note De Niro performance--all weirdo, all the time. No shadings at all. Yeah, yeah, De Niro *is* Travis Bickle. Problem is, Travis Bickle *is* boring until right up to the end of the movie, where he gives us a few minutes of shoot-em-up, then, for absolutely no reason goes right back to what he was before.<br/><br/>Realism? Give me a break. A guy shoots three people, one of them point-blank in the head, and is declared a ""hero"" rather than sent to prison for the rest of his life. Uh-huh. Sorry, but only in Scorcese's mind is New York that f'ed up. Doubtless some people see this as an ironic twist. For me, it's complete bunk, the final insult after having wasted almost two hours watching this crap.<br/><br/>Points for De Niro's pre-punk 'hawk and Jodie Foster's sunglasses.

Robert DeNiro, and his character Travis discovers his wandering life as a Taxi Driver with all that is going on around him. And of course, with all the situations he deals with and witnesses, it really makes some kind of alter-egos of him. And this movie builds up one of the best climaxes made in cinema history, with its editing of slow altitude movements as day goes by, with the dialogue. And all that is disturbing in this film, makes it difficult to find a tranquil light to this. Although I'd say the light is metaphorically translucent, as of being hard to see what is really so wonderful. And this movie actually makes you realize what is wonderful and how you manage and use those expressions. Although it is hard to pertain in the film. Just something that is perspective.

In Travis Bickle we see a character as dark and moody as the setting. While sympathising with the character I also was given a wake-up call in....oftentimes the dark loner is portrayed on film as being something to strive for, a romantic ideal even, but within Travis we see the darker, more realistic side of things. A life of isolation can lead to one losing touch with reality and becoming so introverted as to almost fail to function as human being. This is most evident when Travis takes Betsy to a dirty movie and doesn't understand why she is so upset by it. To sum up, an outstanding essay on the darker side of the human condition."
"analoguebubblebath","Null","0","1","29 April 2001"," Analysing the hairstyle switches
","I believe if you watch the movie again and pay special attention to Travis' hair, you will soon notice that in succeeding scenes, his hairstyle switches back and forth many times between regular length to brush cut. The brush cut seems very weird to me; almost as if it was a make-up job: a skullcap with a brush cut hairdo stuck to it. Of course once the mohawk hairstyle is introduced, which is also an obvious make-up job, the style is maintained till the end. <br/><br/>This is not a continuity mistake in the traditional sense but indicates that the movie has been purposefully edited in this fashion in order drastically restructure the narrative. The story of ""Taxi Driver"" is episodic in nature and could have withstood this sort of rearrangement of scenes more easily had Travis had one continuous look throughout; or at least until the assassination attempt scene. As it is, the changes in hairstyle only help pinpoint the course of this restructuring more easily for the student of the film. <br/><br/>If you read Paul Schrader's published screenplay (Faber and Faber, 1990), and look at the film, much becomes clearer. Director Martin Scorsese went out of his way to remain as faithful as possible to the script. Almost all of the scenes in the script are there; the few minor changes and deletions are of no real importance. The discrepancies between screenplay and film are to be found in the order of presentation of the scenes. Schrader's screenplay indicates precisely where the change in hairstyle occurs in the narrative. <br/><br/>In the script, the first mention of the brush cut is in the scene aptly titled ""A new face in the crowd"" where Travis attends a Palantine campaign rally and talks to a secret service man. The screenplay makes no mention of a ""mohawk"" haircut though; this appears to have been a new idea suggested shortly before production. Thus we assume that Travis has the same look from the beginning of the movie onward up until the campaign rally scene.<br/><br/>
The problem is that in the movie this brush cut look appears long before the ""a new face in the crowd"" scene. The first appearance of the brush cut is in two very short snippets of film lasting less that two seconds each in a montage sequence of Travis driving his cab at night. This is early in the movie, right after Tom, the Albert Brooks character, asks Travis to move his cab because he's blocking the doorway. The shots are so short and intercut between similar shots of Travis with longer hair, inside the dimly lit cab, that the brush cut would remain unseen by most people.<br/><br/>
The brush cut makes it's next sudden and more obvious appearance when Travis nearly runs over Iris, the Jodie Foster character, in the red light district. The scene is quite long as he follows her down the street as she converses with another teenaged hooker. He watches her at the street corner and drives off infuriated as she picks up a john. This is followed by the ""God's Lonely Man"" voice-over scene which is actually almost at the end of the script. So we have had quite a long look at the brush cut by now but Scorsese nevertheless cuts back to the old look as Travis sits at his desk and writes: ""My life has taken another turn again. The days moves along with regularity, one day indistinguishable from the next, a long continuous chain, then suddenly-there is a change."" In the movie, it is assumed that the ""change"" Travis is referring to is his decision to arm himself as the following scene shows him waiting to be picked up by Andy the gun salesman. In the script, the context is entirely different, as Travis says these lines after Betsy, The Cybill Shepherd character, leaves him after their disastrous first date at the porno theater. <br/><br/>The third appearance of the brush cut is in it's rightful place: the ""a new face in the crowd"" scene. Unfortunately, it has been moved up quite a bit and is thus premature. This is preceded and followed by scenes of Travis assuming gunman stances in his room, gunning down a convenience store robber, and watching American Bandstand, with of course, his regular hairstyle. Next, Travis is sitting in his parked cab, with his brush cut, not far from where Palantine is giving a speech. This is where he reads in voice-over a card addressed to his parents. This is followed by Travis watching a soap opera on a TV that he precariously rocking with his foot (back to regular hair). <br/><br/>Afterwards, he picks up Iris and the brush cut stays pretty constantly on the screen till the assassination attempt and the appearance of the mohawk, with the exception of the short shot of Travis supposedly sitting in his cab outside of Iris' room where she is with Sport. <br/><br/>That makes for a lot of switches back and forth if you ask me...."

","""Taxi Driver"" is one of those films that was slightly overrated, yet I have no cause for complaints.  This is a very impressive character study about the distraught life of a loner who meanders through the streets of New York City.  Travis Bickle came to be one of the most famous fictional characters in movie history.  Almost every one of us can relate to Travis in some sort of way.  And it's great how Scorcese used DeNiro's explicit narration to bring us--literally--into the mind of this relatively harmless loner with unrelenting anger beginning to rise to the surface.  And it's the way DeNiro flawlessly portrayed Bickle, displaying every tiny mannerism, that also gets the audience engaged.  Sure, this is an unpleasant, graphic journey through this virtual hellhole--but that's exactly what it is!  Anyone who's been around the streets of New York City at night--and actually survived!--knows fully well that Scorcese flashes every picturesque detail in our faces to receive a perfect vision of the City That Never Sleeps--which is especially true through the eyes of our protagonist.  Later in the film, we watch as Travis works out streneously and purchases guns, mind clouded with thoughts of murder.  But that violent episode is a demonstration of the anger that pumps through anybody's veins in his situation, only Travis outwardly acted upon those thoughts.  We watch as his love for this young prostitute--played brilliantly by Jodie Foster--blossoms and he will do anything to keep her off the streets and out of the hands of her arrogant pimp. <br/><br/>
""Taxi Driver"" is an intense, gripping urban drama that draws you in from start to finish.  It's deeply engaging in it's portrayal of blue-collar America.  The characters are so vivid and realistic and multi-dimensional you feel as you've known these people for years.  This movie doesn't have much plot to follow, as it is predominantly character-driven, but it's moving and fast-paced.  Aside from breakthrough performances by DeNiro and Foster, I also have to note Peter Boyle who doesn't have a huge part but is also terrific.  Plus, there's a great cameo by the great Scorcese as a passenger with suspicions of his philandering wife.  <br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","I have seen few films with such diverse reviews as Scorsese's `Taxi Driver'. Roger Ebert has sighted it as one of his `Great Movies', yet Leonard Maltin gave it only two stars. There is a definite schism between the two critics, but I am personally also dubious in commenting on `Taxi Driver'.<br/><br/>The film is a complex portrait of a man's descent into violence. Travis, played by Robert De Niro, is continually exposed to the horrors of the city as a New York City cab driver. Already seriously disturbed by the war, Travis is the product of several experiences that seriously impair his view of reality. He becomes hopelessly infatuated with an angelic woman he finds in this panorama of horrors, only to be denied by her because he takes her to a dirty movie. He watches such films all the time, but because his perceptions are so skewed, he doesn't understand what is wrong with them. Later he gives a ride to an erratic man who is determined to kill his cheating wife. The man proudly tells Travis that he is going to blow his wife to pieces with a .45 Magnum. Later, when encouraged to buy a gun for protection, Travis requests a .45 Magnum, and buys every gun available to him. He becomes a soldier, ready to face the evil of New York. He works-out diligently, devises methods to draw his guns, and all the time growing farther away from reality. Armed to the teeth, he comes to the aid of a child prostitute. In the end, he lashes out at his demons with violent results.<br/><br/>I have heard rumors that the films premise is based on the film/novel `The Searchers'. Both films center on disturbed veterans that want to save a woman that really doesn't want to be saved. He is simply trying to save the girl from what he hates above all else. <br/><br/>`Taxi Driver' doesn't have a distinct plot, it's simply a character sketch of a disturbed individual; an exceptional sketch. I personally don't see a point to the film, but there's a subtle one and somehow it gets across to viewer.<br/><br/>`Taxi Driver' strikes me a potential disaster. The film is perplexing at times with a difficult protagonist. The script is heavy-handed and too complex to be correctly interpreted. Here's the good news: the film doesn't attempt to explain confusing points, the film just moves forward. De Niro is a godsend to the film, his exceptional acting makes his character understandable but still appropriately detached from the viewer. Martin Scorsese is exacting in his direction with the additions of excellent camera work and film editing. <br/><br/>The violence of the film is superfluous but compelling if the viewer can take it. `Taxi Driver' is not for everyone, but is worth a viewing. 8/10 stars."
